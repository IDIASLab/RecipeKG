I also went the lazy route, once the potatoes were softish, I poured the water off and added black beans and corn, garlic, chili, and onion powder to the same pot, then just mushed it all together. Spread on whole wheat tortilla and added spinach and cheese, and voila, dinner! Nice basic recipe that you could add lots of interesting things to, definitely a keeper. Thanks!",

I also used 2-15 oz of black beans and omitted the corn.  Here's a tip for the sweet potatoes; microwave them instead of boiling. After microwave wrap sweet potatoes in foil and let them rest for 10 mins. They will be nice and soft and fall off the skin; you don't have to peel or chop! Bottom line this recipe is fantastic!",

Short on time, I mixed the ingredients all together (minus the cheese, which I sprinkled on before topping with the other tortilla) instead of layering them, which worked perfectly. I used two medium sweet potatoes and seasoned black beans which jazzed up the flavor. Super easy to get on the table, nutritious, and delicious...a winning trifecta in my book. Served with sliced avacado and the MIL's homemade salsa, this dinner was a homerun.",

The high sodium content is a distraction to an otherwise healthy appetizer (nearly half the sodium is attributable to the flour tortillas). Take note of the 1/2 teaspoon salt in the ingredients as there are two references in the instructions about adding salt... one when boiling the potatoes and another as a seasoning after mashing the potatoes. It s unclear if the specified amount is intended to be divided or not. So you may want to do a taste test before adding 1/2 teaspoon salt as a seasoning. Had to add other seasonings to make this more palatable (i.e. onion powder garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper). We had 10\" flour tortillas and the recipe made three rather than four 8\". Used a cast iron pizza pan to cook the quesadillas and a cake lifter which made it very easy to flip them over. At medium heat the cast iron pan caused them to brown quicker than the time stated in the instructions (i.e. about 2 to 3 minutes per side).",
