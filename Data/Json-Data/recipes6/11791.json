(Banana extract in my case but you can mix and match whatever flavorings you have on hand that you think will taste good together. Lots of room for creativity here.) You only need to make one dough which was very easy and then divide it into 3 equal parts to color and flavor as you wish. For the pink layer I used maraschino cherry juice a couple drops of red food color almond extract and finely chopped maraschino cherries in the dough - tasted great! For the chocolate layer I mixed in 3 Tblsp. of cocoa to the melted chocolate for a richer darker color and flavor. I just added the banana extract to the white layer easy as could be. Very versatile for different occasions and easily assembled in a loaf pan for surprisingly impressive results. Refrigerated for 4 hours and easily removed from the loaf pan I cut the dough into 4 rows for smaller cookies as others suggested and very pleased with the size of the finished product. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and loved the chewy soft texture/results. They were the 'Belle of the Ball' on my cookie tray and the first to disappear! Thank you Missy for sharing and this one is a keeper for sure",

I added the almond to the white dough added 1/2 tsp strawberry extract with the red food coloring to the other dough and for the third mixed in the 1 oz melted chocolate as stated but also added three tablespoons Hershey's cocoa powder when it wasn't as dark looking as I wanted. I only chilled for two hours and it was easy to cut. The only thing I would do different is take the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the dough lengthwise into three sections instead of two as the cookies would be good a bit smaller.
