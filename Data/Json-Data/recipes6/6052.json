The cauliflower breaks down so if you stir it quite a bit after it is finished it does help \"thicken\" but if you want a chili like consistency I recommend reducing the broth to 2 cups. I had never used Quorn prior to this recipe and while not a vegetarian I really enjoyed the product. This soup was simple to make and had great flavor. I prefer soup consistency over chili but even I will cut down on the broth next time.",
