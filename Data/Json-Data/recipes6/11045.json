I used dark-I figured that the color would complement that of the chocolate and that was the only one I had readily available. The sauce was a bit to sweet for me. But that might have been on my part - dark corn syrup adds a caramel flavor. But If that isn't the case I recommend adding a little less sugar perhaps a tbsp less or such. I don't know. The sauce will thicken a little after the saucepan is removed from the heat. The texture was just about right not too gummy but not too watery. If the sauce is used to top ice cream (or another other frozen dessert I am sure) it will become a little chewy but not disgustingly chewy. Overall I was satisfied. I would recommend this recipe for beginners. And just on a side note make sure to use low heat to medium-low heat when melting the chocolate and butter as not to burn them.",
