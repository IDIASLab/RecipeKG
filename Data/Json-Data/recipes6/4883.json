I have my Nonna's  hand written recipe which  was handed down from her Nonna. It is almost exactly ( my Nonna didn't use cayenne)  this recipe but it is called Chicken Franchese.   SO GREAT \n\nLike several of the other reviewers, I too would cut back on the lemon, and disregard the cayenne.  Also keep your chicken stock handy in case the sauce gets too thick while heating. \n\n*We always make extra sauce, and serve it over pasta so every taste of the delicious sauce can be enjoyed. \n\nthank you\n\nFYI   My Nonna was born in the  Amalfi region of Italy (southern) where this recipe is a staple for all kinds of dishes i.e. mostly veggies like eggplant, but also used for chicken, veal, and pork that's pounded into thin cutlets. The style of preparation is called \"indorato\" which translates to \"encased in gold\"",

I followed the recipe to a \"T\" and it was wonderful. I also watched the video which Chef lets you know a few different things you can use in place of some of the ingredients. I used sherry and it was delicious. I also made this for a family get together so I quadrupled the recipe without any problems and like I said it is so easy to make. I also made a beet salad with this and had some white wine. And as always Chef John, perfect. Thanks again :)",

                "reviewBody": "Hubs and I really enjoyed this Chicken French last night!  Having said that, let me say that I did make a few changes, but nothing drastic.  The amount of flour indicated in  the recipe is a ridiculous amount!  For  two small chicken breast halves (about 5 oz. each),  I used just 2 T. of flour and 1/4 t. of salt and pepper, along with the pinch of cayenne, and I still didn\u2019t use it all!  I beat one egg and the milk in a pie plate, dredged the chicken in the flour mixture and dunked it in the egg.  I covered the pie plate with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator about an hour before dinner, as Chef John mentions in the video.  I browned the chicken for 4 minutes on a side over medium heat and removed it to a warm oven.  For the sauce, I had to use chicken broth, but kept the other ingredients the same, except the lemon juice, which I cut way back, using just 1 t. for my version.  The sauce didn\u2019t thicken for me, so I did add a little cornstarch/water, just enough to give it some nice body and \u201ccling,\u201d which really helped.  The only thing I would change from my version next time, would be to put the parsley in at the very end.  It tended to darken after the chicken was added back in and reheated.  Next time, I will add the parsley after plating the chicken, but before spooning the sauce over the top.  All and all, a great recipe, and one we\u2019ll be making again!  Thanks, Chef John!",

Unfortunately this site completely missed the mark as to the origin of this dish.   It is a very traditional recipe from the old country.   It's original name is chicken Francese. ( which translates to chicken French ) Tyler Florence also has a great version of this recipe   I lived in Rochester for years and it is served in many restaurants.   I have also eaten it in Italy, and I have been in Dallas for about 35 years....  And it is served at every Italian restaurant too !   Not sure why there is confusion about this being a dish created created in NY.",
