I cooked the white grits according to the package and when they were done I put in a pat of butter and a good sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.  I also added minced garlic to the onion, green pepper mixture.  When the shrimp where done, I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth (to loosen the bits from the pan).  At the very end I added a handful of  grated cheddar and a sprinkle of Old Bay to the shrimp.  I wish I could say that my whole family loved it but alas...they dont like seafood.  I, however, thought it was wonderful!!!",

I cooked the bacon whole and saved to sprinkle on top; added minced garlic to the pepper and onion, cooked that down and added about 2 TBSP of flour before adding the shrimp (which I increased to 2 lbs, jumbo-precooked); lastly I used water instead of chicken broth for my grits (personal preference).  This recipe is a keeper for sure-Thanks!",

I couldn't bring myself to add a whole cup of cheese to the grits either - so overall if you really want a flavor punch I think the other reviewers that ramped up the shrimp seasoning had it right. I'll do that next time and will season the grits a little more to make up for the flavor lost by not adding a whole cup of cheese. Otherwise it was pretty good. I am still trying to come close to the flavor of the shrimp and grits and I had at Pisces Rising in Mt Dora Florida. This doesn't quite capture the lushness of that dish.",
