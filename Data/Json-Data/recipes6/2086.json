The spice combination is different from anything that I have ever tried and yet it is perfection.  Because I used thicker pork chops, I finished them off in the oven at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes.  Everyone raved about this dish that I served with mashed sweet potatoes.  This dish paired perfectly with a Chateau Ste.Michelle Riesling.  I will make this time and again.",

I only deviated from the recipe by leaving out the garlic  (I hate garlic), and I didn't have sage so I used basil. \nIf you want your chops to turn out super juicy and tender, try using a cast iron skillet. The initial browning sears the meat, locking the juices inside. Mine ended up with a wonderfully crispy outside and a moist tender inside.\nAlso, the apples taste really good with rice.",
