However, I would suggest that after the noodles are done boiling, drain and seperate them and then let them cool for a few minutes before rolling.  \n\nI added chopped mushrooms and very finely chopped onion and garlic to the cheese mixture but I can't seem to make myself cook without garlic and onions!Personally, I think the onions especially added to the taste.\n\nTo give people making this for the first time an idea of how many lasagna noodles you need, I used 18 noodles in a 9x13 pan.  I had three rows of six noodles.  Also, I put a small handful of cheese mixture in each noodle.  \n\nI'm always looking for recipes that work well with two people in the kitchen and this is definitely one of them!  My husband and I chatted and drank wine while filling and rolling the noodles.",

I've made this quite a few times now and always add chopped fresh basil, 1/2 (10 oz.) box thawed frozen spinach for more green/health factor, dash of nutmeg to ricotta mixture and salt/pepper to taste.  But the tofu addition is SUPERB (use soft or medium firm- breaks up easier). Great way to add more protein/vitamins for the kids and my kids love it because each roll is a perfect serving size- and pretty too.  Just remember to go easy when spreading the filling on the lasagna, too much and it won't roll. I've made this for company, always get raves.  It's a pretty dish and guest are always impressed that they can't taste the tofu and that the dish tastes great.  Try it Moms!",
