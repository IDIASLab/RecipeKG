Many reviewers said that the cookie came out bland so i added 1 and a half tsp of cinnamon half a tsp of ground cloves and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg. (im assuming instead of those 3 allspice would give the same effect as well). I really recommend doing that. I also added some molasses about 1/4-1/2 a tsp. The cookie cake turned out flavorful and soft on the inside yet firm on the outside. PERFECTION! The spices gave it a ginger spice cookie-esk taste but it worked well. I also added chocolate chips and used butter cream frosting. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!:)",
