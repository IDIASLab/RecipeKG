Since I didn't have almond extract the first time, that's the only thing I left out. The second time, I used the almond extract and found it didn't complement the peanut butter taste. I recommend leaving it out & using vanilla extract. I also recommend using a cookie scoop to insure uniformity in appearance and cooking time; I use a reusable Silpat -- cookies are perfectly browned & slide off, without need for greasing or parchment. For a more defined criss-cross, use a pastry blender instead of a fork. If you don't have margarine, use unsalted butter instead; salted or a blend of both is OK also, but unsalted is just a bit healthier (as if cookies are healthy...haha). All in all, this is a great recipe, it's the one I use all the time.",

So although I thought I had already found my favorite recipe for peanut butter cookies on AR, this one interested me. The almond extract does something subtle, not strong, to the flavor--enhances it & mellows it out at the same time. They are buttery, slightly crisp, and chewy. Try it as written, you won't be sorry. Excellent recipe, and thanks for sharing, Stephanie.",

I used natural peanut butter since that's what I had at home and added an extra half teaspoon each of the vanilla and almond extracts to compensate for the reduced sweetness. Also I only had a 1/2 cup of brown sugar at home so I upped the white sugar to a cup and a half instead of a cup. The one warning I would offer is if you are making these cookies for company pay attention to the directions about how far apart to spread the cookies and make sure you shape them into a ball otherwise they will run into each other and you won't see the criss cross design as well. My later batches were much more attractive than the first one when I put the balls too close together and didn't fully shape the balls of dough. If they are just for you and your family though it doesn't really matter you will love these cookies no matter what they look like!",
