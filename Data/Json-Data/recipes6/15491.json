Then the mixture needs to be poured out AS SOON AS the baking soda is stirred in.  The directions \"stir until light and foamy\"  are a little misleading.  It doesn't become light and foamy as you stir. . . it becomes less light and foamy.  It was hard to pour out, but ended tasting very good.\n\n*update:  I have now made this recipe numerous times.  At first I gave it 4 stars; however, if you follow the hint I gave above, the recipe is 5 stars.  The Peanut Brittle is fantastic.  My grandmother is THE candy-maker, and my mom says that she cannot tell the difference between mine and my grandmother's (she slaves away all day on her's).  Also, this recipe is delicious topped with chocolate.  All you have to do is put a layer of semi-sweet chocolate chips (or whatever kind of chocolate you prefer) on top of the brittle as soon as you pour the mixture out onto the cookie sheet.  The chocolate will start to melt; simply spread the chocolate over the peanut brittle with a spatula.  Absolutely delish!",

My brittle came out perfect. I used the exacts ingredients of this recipe and then this is what I did. I put parchment paper on my cookie sheet. Then I microwaved (800watts) the sugar corn syrup and salt for 4 minutes in a 4 cup glass measure. I added the peanuts and microwaved for 3 1/2 minutes. Then added the butter and vanilla and microwaved for 1 1/2 minutes. I stirred in the baking soda real quick and and spread it out on the parchment paper with a spatula sprayed with Pam.

Don't need to add salt if your nuts are salted already. Use 2 TEASPOONS of Baking Soda- makes it so perfect easy to chew & it won't stick in your teeth at all. I make this with cashews a mix of cashews and peanuts- follow the directions and it is perfect every time. I put all my ingredients out to have ready- the candy is like LAVA and you gotta work fast or get pulled under... Oh- spray foil with PAM and spread the candy down to cool then it lifts right off after about 15-20 minutes resting.",

I used raw spanish peanuts which are commenly called for in peanut brittle used a glass 2qt casserole dish (no breakedge) and I used parchment paper on top of the cookie sheet (no mess). Microwave times were dead on. I made 3 batches. The key was to let the microwave set for a bit to cool down between batches. Thank you for a fun easy and tasty recipe.
