I didn\u2019t have bell pepper or green onions, so I subbed in a small diced carrot and added a little onion powder to the marinade. I also used some leftover brown rice. I almost didn\u2019t add the jalape\u00f1o because I was worried it would be too spicy for me, but it was pleasantly spicy even with some sambal oelek on top. It had a nice heat, but it was never overwhelming. I will definitely make this again and try the recipe more \u201cout of the box.\u201d It was comforting, tasty, and filling.",

Probably reduce the amount for a bit\n-Tuna in Olive oil (had to use chunks in water and boil off the water and replace it with Olive oil. Not as good as the ones that came in can with plain old vegetable oil as it came out way too \"fishy\" for my taste\n-Jalapeno pepper (fresh not available; substituted with finger peppers or pickled jalapeno)\n-Unwashed long grain rice (tried unwashed; got hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. not a good idea for the quality of rice we produce. we have to wash it. probably need to add cornstarch or rice starch powder but don't know how much)",
