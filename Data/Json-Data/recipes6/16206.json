I even tried rolling the dough into balls and placed two side-by-side in a muffin pan... and they baked up well. Enjoy! Email this to a friend! Thanks Monica! Oh and try cutting Pollish sausage into 3rds and wrapping this dough around them and making \"pigs-in-a-blanket\". Yummm!!!",

I put the rolls in the refrigerator and tried again the next day. I let them sit for a whole afternoon and part of the evening in a warm environment but to no avail. They never raised! I baked them anyway and ended up with what looked like cookies.. I was so dissapointed because of the waste of time and ingredients.",

Therefore the bread did not rise and I ended up throwing away the whole batch. As I hate wasting food this made me pretty upset.
