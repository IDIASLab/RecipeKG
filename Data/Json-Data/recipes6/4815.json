I have never used pumpkin puree in chili but I think it gives a beautiful velvety touch along with the coconut milk. I did add a red pepper and pretty much doubled the recipe. I will DEF make this again and tweek a bit. Maybe a hint of lime would be great. Thanks so much!",

Just wondering... since you're roasting stuff anyway why not roast the onions too? Something to experiment with next time.",

I made a few adjustments: I added 12 oz of crushed pineapple(broiled w/ corn and some spices sprinkled over) a red pepper 1 large 30 oz. can of pumpkin puree 1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of Oregano(I was out) In addition to a can of Black Beans I added 1 can of Buttered Beans as well to level out doubling the pumpkin and pineapple. I only used 2 C. of vegetable broth instead of 3 C. because others said it came out more like a soup. I'm really glad I used less broth. I like it thicker. I could still have used less broth. I added an extra 1 1/2 tsp of Harrissa Spice(blend of Caraway Cayenne Chiles Coriander Cumin Garlic) Just thought it would give it more kick. I made this before bed and left it in the slow cooker all night. I was taste testing it before I went to bed and I kept saying wow this is REALLY nice but let me tell you the spices intensified over night quite a bit but not so much that it was too overpowering. Yes the xtra pineapple flavor made it sweeter but it still came together so good even with the extra pumpkin. I would not change the way I made it. I feel the extra spice I added is good this time of year (Late Dec.) but Summer I might not add as much spice because I noted the night before how nice the flavor was as well. I really think also next time I might even do less broth(1 1/2 C.) because It is still a little like soup. I am grateful thank you for sharing the recipe:) I would have never thought of it.",

However, I don't believe that these changes make a substantial difference in the results. First, I used frozen corn instead of canned, 1 pound of mushrooms (love them in everything!), green pepper instead of yellow, my own homemade tomato sauce (using garden fresh tomatoes), my own homemade pumpkin puree, and parsley instead of cilantro. I might have used beans that I had in the freezer (plain boiled), but I can't quite remember. Everything else was the same (ha, ha - I hope the recipe review police won't get after me! \n\nAnyway, our family found this chili quite delicious, and made with unusual ingredients. I served it with Basmati rice as it was a little soupy. Thanks to the submitter for this interesting recipe!",
