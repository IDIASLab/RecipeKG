Fresh corn is the only way to go on this folks, so put that frozen corn back into the freezer.  The chowder wasn\u2019t quite as thick as I would have preferred, so I did add additional flour to get it to the consistency I like.  Next time, I\u2019ll cut the potatoes into larger pieces, maybe 1/2\u201d.  I know that\u2019ll add some time to partially cook them, but I think I\u2019ll like that better, and the chowder\u2019s eye appeal will improve, as well.  I used fat free half-and-half, and it worked well.  I think  crumbled crisp bacon would be a nice garnish.  KandyKates, enjoyed your chowder!",
