The more air you trap inside the egg whites, the lighter your cake will be. Use a finer grained sugar and CAKE flour (not all purpose) and you'll get rid of the grainy texture.  Extra sifting helps with this as well. Adding citrus zest or a little bit of sprite helps sweeten it without making it taste like sugar. This is one of the most versatile and useful basic cake recipes I've used.",

Make sure you mix all dry ingredients together first before adding wet. I did not get a cornmeal consistency at all. Also be sure to beat the egg white until stiff and it is important to mix in some first then gently fold in the rest this is what makes the cake light and fluffy. It is my sons birthday today and this cake is always THE birthday cake with a nice buttercream frosting I get a lot of requests for this cake. Sometimes I just do a 9x13 sometimes cupcakes and sometimes the layers. It is the BEST cake!",

I thought surely they had done something wrong, and that the recipe itself was not at fault. Sorry to say, they hit the nail on the head! This cake was easy to make, but that's about the only positive thing I can say.  It was fairly dry, dense, crumbly, did not handle frosting very well, and did have a flavor and texture like cornbread. Also, the batter was certainly not enough for 2 9-inch pans.  My 4 year old niece enjoyed having it for dessert, but that's because she only ate the frosting. I wouldn't suggest bothering with this one.",

                "reviewBody": "Even tho' this cake could use a little more flavor I'm still giving it a 5-star rating because its got so much else going for it. Baking white or yellow cakes is almost a gamble particularly because of its high chance of being dry. This cake is NOT dry however note that I added two more egg whites and used half and half rather than milk. I'm sure each of these slight modifications in addition to carefully making sure I didn't overbake it are responsible for that. The cake is moist brilliant white light and fluffy. So...if you add a little more vanilla and/or a touch of almond extract this would definitely be all you'd ask for in a white cake. Because it's a more delicate cake this is best I believe with a lighter type frosting. I baked this as cupcakes for about 16 minutes in silicone baking cups which I've now learned I don't like.",

No need to beat them just mix until incorporated. Second make sure your egg whites are very stiff. Third when mixing the egg whites into the batter FOLD don't mix. It's ok to have a small lump here and there. Finally make sure to start checking your cake about 5-10 min before time to ensure you don't over bake. You will achieve a very moist and light cake.
