Also, I added a bunch of frozen green beans to the mix to get more veggies in there.\r\n\r\nMy family (including two kids - 4 and 2) LOVED this, and my husband asked me when I was going to make it again.\r\n\r\nI served it with oven roasted broccoli (broccoli, olive oil and a little salt put in the oven at 450 for about 15 minutes.)

It's usually a way of using leftovers!  :-)    Marmite/Vegemite are sold in lots of supermarkets, or is available online at Amazon.  It's a great secret ingredient for vegetarians, when used in small amounts, adding a depth of flavor to stews and soups.  It can also be used as a substitute for anchovy paste in recipes calling for that.  This Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie filling could also be made using bulgur wheat instead of barley.  The combination of bulgur (or barley) with lentils makes a great pilaf and a satisfying \"meaty\" filling or base for shepherd's pie, moussaka, stuffing peppers, veggie-burgers, etc.",

I also added a cup of water into the barley/lentil mixture before putting it in the oven because I was worried it would have been too dry. I was correct in doing so as all the water I added was absorbed. The coarseness of the lentils barley walnuts in conjunction with the smoothness of the potato topping just doesn't work. It's chewey and completely throws me off of the rest of the dish. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is that at least the flavour was half decent and the dish was marginally edible if you are starving and there is nothing left in your house.",

I tried it two nights ago followed instructions exactly and ended up with a very dense extremely plain tasting unpleasant brown/white casserole.

I've been a vegetarian for a long time now and I wonder how many great veggie recipes some of the readers here have tried. This one had a savory taste and thick texture but there was just no variety of flavor no creaminess no color blech. I tried it again the next night thinking it might age well but no change. Adding copious amounts of cheese green onions and bacon bits on top helped it resemble a baked potato so we could finish it off.",
