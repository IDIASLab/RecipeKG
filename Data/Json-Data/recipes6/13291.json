Strongly recommend to cooks of all skill levels.",

I followed the recipe exactly but my husband and I both didn't like it. Of course I'm comparing it to pumpkin and maybe that's wrong (like comparing apples to oranges). I therefore didn't rate this recipe. Unfortunately I ended up throwing the pie out and the recipe. I'll stick to pumpkin.",

I cut back on the sugar since I have gestational diabetes and it was still delicious. Other than that I followed the directions pretty closely though I added a little more spices to compensate for the reduced sugar. I think I put in about a 1/4 off a cup of brown sugar. I did add a little vanilla but that just makes sense... This came out really great it satisfied my craving without making me ill.",
