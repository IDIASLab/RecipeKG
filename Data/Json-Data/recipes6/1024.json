Due to making it for a crowd I increased everything(except the cayenne) and baked it, layered (1/2 the potatoes first on which I sprinkled the cinnamon, cayenne and brown sugar, then the apples/onions, topped with the ham, then repeated)  in a 9 x 13 dish with just enough water to cover the bottom of the dish, altho I think apple or orange juice would work great. I dotted the top with 6 thin pats of butter- did not use the oil called for- and covered it with foil during baking.  Flavor was great and it was a perfect brunch dish.  It took longer to bake than I thought it would; it cooked at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours to get the potatoes soft ( I had pre-microwaved the potatoes but they were still pretty hard when I loaded the casserole).",
