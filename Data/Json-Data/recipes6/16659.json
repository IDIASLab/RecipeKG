However i do not have the forms so here's what i did - at home depot had them cut a dowel rod (sorry not sure on size, went by guessing!) anyway, they cut it into 4-5 inch pieces. I wrapped these in aluminum foil and sprayed with baking pam. Wrapped pre-made pastry puff around them and baked them @ 400 for roughly 12 minutes. With filling these are perfection!",

I even added some vanilla and some powered sugar to try to cut the shortening taste but it still didn't mask it. Also I was confused on the recipe because it said to use 1 cup of milk and the directions on the pudding said to use 2 cups. Should I have gone by the pudding drections instead of only using 1 cup? I may try it again but using the milk qty on the pudding box and replacing 1/2 of the shortening with butter. Good luck!",
