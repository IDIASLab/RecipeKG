Instead of poking the cake with a fork I used a wooden skewer and poked holes on top of the cake making sure to poke all the way down to the platter I placed the cake on therefore the glaze ran down inside the cake. The glaze is so simple to make using thawed lemonade. Great idea.",

(Measured it out when thawed since this was a large can). It was excellent. I was real leary of the pouring this on top of the cake but it was fine. I also iced this but cheated somewhat. I took a tub of white butter cream icing heated it in the mircowave until melted then added 3 TLB leftover limeade and 1/2 cup give or take a little confectioner's sugar mixed well and while still warm poured over the top of the cake. When it set up it had a nice semi-glossy sheen perfectly smooth and was great! This cake was the hit of the dessert table and I will definitely be making it again.",
