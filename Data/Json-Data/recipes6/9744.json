The only change I made was to add an additional can of tomato sauce & some Italian seasoning just to give it a bit more flavor. My son is a picky eater and he loved it. My husband wasnt fond of the lentils (there are quite a lot) so when I make it again I would probably do half as many lentils & maybe add some carrots. Thanks for the delicious recipe:)",
