I bought 1 lb just to be safe and still didn't have enough filling to go around. 2) The directions read 2 tablespoons of filling were to be put in each bun but there were probably only 8 tablespoons of filling total; I think it should have read 1-2 teaspoons - or 1 tablespoon at the maximum if you made extra filling. 3) Coating the bowl with 2 tablespoons of oil seemed excessive to me; I just used 1 and it worked fine. After I made these changes things went smoothly and the char siu bao turned out great; a lot like the ones from back home! I made my own char siu with a packaged marinade mix instead of trying to find it at a store. If you want tasty dim sum try this one out; if I can do it anyone can:) Thank you so much for the great recipe!",

Although the filling was a tad too sweet, I nevertheless got used to it and ended up liking it more than the filling of some buns I've bought in restaurants.  The dough was a little dry, yeasty, and bland, not quite as sweet as most buns, but not really bothersome.\n \n\nLike another reviewer observed, the directions are incorrect.  I cut the dough recipe in half without changing the quantity of meat and even then I ended up with a bit more dough than I needed.\n \n\nIn step one, the yeast-flour-water mixture never bubbled.\n \n\nIn step four, follow the directions and put only two tablespoons of filling in each bun.  (I was tempted to put in more.  I was wrong.)  If you use enough dough in a bun so that you can put in, say, two heaping tablespoons comfortably, the bun will end up uncomfortably large.  And you'll also end up with an imbalance between meat and bread in each bite.\n \n\nI also learned that one should make the dough thinner than one thinks.  (The dough rises a lot.)  But the hardest thing about making buns is getting the dough to be a uniform thickness on all sides.  I guess I just need to practice how to make a bun with a good balance of meat and dough everywhere.\n \n\nFollowing my revised recipe makes two _main course_ servings.\n \n\nIf you freeze the buns before steaming, they freeze well.\n \n\nIncidentally, it took me 2.5 hours to cook from start to finish.\n",
