I use arm shoulder roast and cut it up cause some beef stew meat is too tough. You can also make this with turtle meat and call it turtle stew, that's what we do! You can adjust the ingredients according to your own taste. We love to eat this with buttered bread.",

Well the secret to cooking down tough meat is to seer it first to just brown the outsides... then get out your pressure cooker to cook it down in 20 minutes or less... let it cool down and cook the rest of your ingrediants all together either with the cooker top on or just left open like a regular pot... that tough piece of meat will fall apart and be as tender as you could ever imagine.",

I also add a few shakes of seasoned salt when adding the tomatoes Also just because I like mine a little more soupy I add some beef broth or water flavored with beef bouillon. As far as spicing it up I put a bottle of tabasco pepper sauce on the table for those who like a little more kick. The tabasco flavor blends perfectly with this stew. This is the easiest way to please everyone without making it too spicy or too mild. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!",
