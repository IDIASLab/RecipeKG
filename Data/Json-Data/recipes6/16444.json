When you are in a hurry and have very few staples on hand, you may want to give this dessert a try.  That is the basic recipe and good for the times of depression when extras are scarce. Serve either hot or cold. It is good plain but better with milk, cream, whipped cream or lemon sauce.",

Mix the dry ingredients without the apples together in a bowl; gradually add the milk while mixing to get a smooth texture, and then add in the apples. That way you won't get the \"milk curdling\" affect (it's not that the milk is curdling; it's that the flour is not mixed smoothly). You can also add cinnamon and chopped pecans (or walnuts) for enhancement. And you can furthermore top with caramel. With these changes to the recipe, it comes out really nicely.",

Followed ingredients exactly using white whole wheat flour and Rhode Island Greening apples (a good baking apple that is tart and keeps its shape w/o cooking down too much) and whole milk. It looked a little liquidy after the 45 minutes so we put it back in for 15 more and it set perfectly. I wasn't sure what kind of flavor it would have w/o any spices and was amazed at how much creamy appley flavor it has. Definitely a keeper here!!",
