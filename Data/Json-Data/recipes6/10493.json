I used a little less baking mix in the mixture and was generous with baking mix in the roll out. I also used more cinnamon then called for and more sugar - I put a thick coat of it on top of the butter and then dusted the tops before baking. Additionally two minutes before I took the buns out of the oven I brushed them with butter. The outer part of the roll was more biscuit like - but the centers were moist and delicious. I also needed more milk for the icing - maybe an 1/8 of a cup or so.",
