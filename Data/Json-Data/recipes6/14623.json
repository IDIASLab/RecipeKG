I used two smoked turkey legs instead of the beef bone and based on another reviewer's comments about the wine being overpowering I reduced the red wine measurement to 3/4 cup which was perfect. The cooking time of 3 to 4 hours is nowhere near long enough though. I cooked this on low for 10 hours and the beans were just right except the skins were a bit tough. Next time I think I'll hold off on adding the salt until about an hour before serving since adding salt too early when cooking beans can cause the skins to be tough (I totally forgot about this until after I'd already put the salt in).",
