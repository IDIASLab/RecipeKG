Also I halved the recipe I had 6 over-ripe plums in the fridge. I used soft butter instead of the margorine to cut it into the dry ingredients to give it the \"crumbly effect\"",

Since they were smallish I ended up using 20. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and it was plenty. I didn't have instant tapioca so I used what I had on hand - the pearl slow-cooking tapioca. Not a good idea as it didn't really cook through. I normally love tapioca and its a nice concept but I think next time I will omit that. I made a baking mix I found on this site (2 1/4 cup flour 1 tbsp. baking powder 3/4 tsp salt 1/2 cup shortening. Mix dry indgredients cut in shortening til crumbly.) Turned out wonderfully - except for the slightly chewy tapioca which was my fault!",
