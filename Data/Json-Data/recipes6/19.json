I generally double the batch and keep them in the freezer. They taste even better frozen (still soft!). Whole grains, fiber, and protein and no butter! Can it really be delicious? Yes! My kids can't keep their fingers out of the batter. I decided to add it to Allrecipes because everyone keeps asking me for the recipe. Enjoy!",

PERFECTION! NO CRUMBLING AND MY 7 YR OLD DAUGHTER GOBBLES THEM! Pretty dang good. I had to make a few changes, like raisins instead of the dried cherries, but if you had them the cherries would have given a nice pop of flavor (I suppose you could try Craisins or even the cherry flavored Craisins as an alternative too). I added a small gala apple to the food processor (minus stem and seeds) for a little extra fruit content, and my cookies came out very moist (a bit crumbly like many other comments). I think I might add another egg next time? I love the walnuts being ground up. My daughters chomped away on an omega3 & 6 rich, high fiber snack and never once caught on to my diabolical plan to give them something healthy. Possibly my new favorite cookie recipe. I wonder how coconut oil would do instead of the canola?",

I used two eggs, replaced the brown sugar with 1/3 cup Stevia (cup for cup style), added 2 tbls chia seeds to dry ingredients, and subbed melted coconut oil for canola.  I used gluten free oats and gluten free flour.  I, too, ground the oats in the food processor, and everything mixed really well.  Flatting the cookies before baking them worked best for me.  I can hardly make them fast enough to keep up with the family.  \r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with breakfast cookies for a while, and I love the fact that these use so little regular flour.  These are the best I've tried yet, and they are really healthful as well.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!",

The unflattened cookie tasted delicious as well but the flat versions travel well. I baked half of the batch right away and put the other half in the fridge and baked them up a few days later.

But the cookies just didn't seem sweet enough, and they were heavy.  I wish I had NOT flattened them with the spatula.
