I prepared everything the night before in my crockpot and kept it in the fridge overnight so that I could pull it out plug it in and go in the morning. It cooked on low for 10 hours and came out nice that way too. The sauce starts out really thick but thins way down after it mixes with the juices of the pork. It has a really nice flavor and the spiciness is just right. It was a little too sweet for our liking so next time I'd just cut back on the brown sugar. This one is a keeper for sure!",

I didn't have any prepared mustard on hand so I increased the mustard powder to 1 tbsp. I used McCormick's. I didn't have but one 6 oz. can of tomato paste so I used that along with a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. I had run out of cayenne pepper so I used 1 tbsp. of Chili powder. I covered my roaster pan tightly with foil and cooked the meat for 3.5 hours. I then removed the meat from the bone shredded it as best as possible and covered the meat back up. I then allowed it to continue cooking for another 2 hours. It came out slightly sweet with just a little kick of spicy. We had the \"Cream Corn Like No Other\" from Allrecipes shared both with one of our neighborhood friends and everyone had a wonderful dinner. My husband froze the leftover meat so that we could have it again some night when neither of us feels like cooking.",
