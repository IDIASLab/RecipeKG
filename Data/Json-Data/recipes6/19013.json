The reason for this is because if you only make one you will hate yourself the next day when there are no leftovers. The quiche microwaves well the next day. In fact most people say that the flavors have blended better on the second day... If in the strange case that you are filled up with one pie, this is a great gift to give a friend or relative, or if you are stingy...it freezes well with tin foil.",

Be sure to spray your pie plate before adding the ingredients and use olive oil spray to saute onions. I left out the mushrooms only because I don't like them. I also did not cook the spinach as other reviewers suggested. Thaw and drain is enough. I used no fat or low fat everything and it was delicious!!",

The recipe didn't call for deep dish pie crusts, so I bought regular ones and they weren't nearly big enough.  What was in the crusts was great, but I must have lost about 4 eggs when I pured the egg mixture over the crust, it spilled everywhere!  I would still highly reccommend this recipe, just make sure you buy deep dish crusts.  Thanks!!!",

I'm always looking for new recipes that have calories, protein, etc.   I found your recipe a few weeks ago.  My father didn't know what quiche was, but I told him he'd probably like it and its better than scrambled eggs.  Tonight I made your quiche.  I took out all the meat, and substituted turkey bacon(not a pork person).   My father ate an entire piece and he loved it!  Your recipe is a blessing to me and I thank you with all my heart for taking the time to post it.   I just wanted to say \"Thank you\", and to let you know that sometimes even just posting a recipe can truly change someone's life for the better.

I made two modifications, I used a little over a pound of bacon and deleted the ham and substituted broccoli for the spinach. \n\nAfter reading everyones comments I was a little gun shy about the amount it made so I had some extra pie crust and tins on \"standby\". The way I made them there was just slightly more than would  fit in two 9 inch tins (1 deep, 1 regular). My only criticism is that this takes WAY more time to prepare than 15 minutes. The preparation of the bacon takes longer than that. Also, this recipe uses a lot of cheese and if you don't want to pay a fortune to buy it shredded, that step will also be time consuming.\n\nWe will definitely make this fantastic recipe again. You cannot go wrong with this one.",

I pre-bake the pie shells for around 10 minutes.  I eat one and freeze the other.  The frozen one tastes just as good as the fresh quiche.  Instead of ham, I use fresh smoked bacon.  Instead of frozen spinach, I use two bunches of fresh baby spinach.  I've also substituted a fresh bunch of spinach for broccoli as that combination works really well too.  SOOOOOOO good!!!

I took the advice of previous review and cut back on cheese amounts (5 oz vs. 8 oz) and substituted the spinach for same size pkg of frozen chopped broccoli - also deleted the bacon and just used smoked ham steak (diced)- also added diced green and red peppers to onion/mushroom/ham saute mix.  Nice flavour and colour.  On advice of previous review, I held back on egg mixture (I had enough left over for my boyfriend to make one massive omelette at work later on!) - any more egg mix in the quiche pie shells (deep dish 9\") would have definitely overflowed but didn't due to cutting back.  Would suggest cutting back to 6 eggs vs. 8 (if using large eggs).  Could have gone 45 minutes vs. 40 in oven but overall - awesome recipe and enough for 6 adults with tossed salad.  Thanks for the recipe, Clark!  I will definitely be making again!",

I'm embarrased to have served it to my family. I'll stick with the wild rice and ham from this site. If I could give this a lower rating I would. Leaves a bad after taste in your mouth and the flavors do not blend well... at all. I see most everyone who gave it 5 stars altered the recipe then rated it... I made it exact but I'm glad I only made one.",
