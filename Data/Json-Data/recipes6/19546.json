ANd it's GREAT!  if you want a really wonderful lower fat/carb version, marinate the chicken in the liquids and DUST marinated chicken with onlypart of the cornstarch. Dry fry or use 1tsp at a time of peanut oil in a non stick wok until cooked.  Dump the sugar and use 2/3c sucralose and always use apple cider vinegar. use half the amount of cornstartch to thicken or use arrowroot powder. Traditional sauces (according to my Chinese friends) are a bit thinner than the thick styles.  Just by not deep frying the meat, you can save hube amounts of fat calories and cutting the sugar and the cornstartch removes much of the carb count too.   This recipe is great as it is... but I'm just saying you can low fat-lower carb this dish so even those on special diets can enjoy :)",

I made a couple of changes: veggie broth for chicken; bumped the vinegar to 3/8 cup; brown sugar instead of white; red pepper flakes instead of chili paste; 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of boiling the sauce as the recipe suggests, I stir-fried the garlic in the sesame oil then added my fake meat and veggies, then added everything else. I stirred in cornstarch until I was happy with the consistency so I probably used less than called for in the recipe. But the sauce was nice and thick, and a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy. This is one is definitely a keeper!",

Instead of pouring the sauce on the chicken on a platter, I poured the sauce in the skillet and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes. It gave the chicken more flavor and let the sauce soak into the meat more. Finally served over jasmine rice and it was delicious.",
