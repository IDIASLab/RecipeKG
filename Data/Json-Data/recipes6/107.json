I made a double batch of this recipe cause one package of the little smokies looked too small. Glad I did. I brought them to a Memorial Day BBQ and they were all gone in less than an hour! The longest step is wrapping in bacon but it's the most important step. I liked adding the toothpicks cause it does help keep the bacon on and easy to pick up out of the slow cooker when at a party. Not sure why someone gave it a 1 star. They were really vague with their reasoning for the 1 star. People need to give more specifics when they review recipes or they're review really isn't all that effective for other homes cooks. I'd disregard that review entirely. These are a keeper if you like mini wieners and bacon!",
