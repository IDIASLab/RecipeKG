I beat the bejesus out of the egg whites and as soon as I added sugar (even the first spoonful) it went flat. Anyone who claims they didn't get a unicookie is simply lying. I whipped the eggs until they peaked like Mt. Everest and then the sugar flattened them out like Kansas. This recipe is a good way to lower your self esteem.",
