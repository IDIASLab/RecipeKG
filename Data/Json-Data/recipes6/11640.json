We love this salad goes great with the slow cooker roast beef recipe I have posted here on allrecipes.com. Thanks for the great recipe. One other time I made it I added chopped celery AND a small jar of pimento's. Really colorful.",

Other ones leave a vinegar-y taste in your mouth..NOT THIS ONE! I only used a half a cup of sugar and it was perfect UPDATE I made a HUGE batch of this for my outdoor wedding and there was none left over. I also bring it to any party where I'm asked to bring a side dish because it seems like everyone loves it Although it said to refrigerate 12 hours my sister came over about 4 hours after I put it in the fridge. We both ate some (it was still watery of course because I didn't let it sit long) but I strained it and we both agreed it was GOOOOOD I will bring this salad to EVERY cookout I go to. It was SO easy to put together and the results are comparable to a restaurant! o.k I'll stop now...I just can't say enough!",
