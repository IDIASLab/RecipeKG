My dad worked for Tuscan Dairy for fifty years in Union, N.J. and they made an amazing rice pudding, which I've never been able to even nearly duplicate. Thanks to you, this is pretty close! I omitted the raisins and used skim milk because it was the only thing I had in the house. The next time Ty gets a desire to make this great dessert, I'll have her use evaporated skim milk as it really replicates a light cream or a whole milk. Thanks so much!",

I followed the suggestions of others and used medium grain rice and half the sugar called for. I didn't put the sugar into the pudding until it was the consistency I wanted. Remember to put some of the warm mixture into the egg and milk before SLOWLY adding it to your pot so you don't end up with \"egg-drop\" in your rice pudding!\n\nIf you've never made rice pudding before or are looking for an excellent, easy recipe, this one is for you!

I never made homemade rice pudding before, but I had all the ingredients and some left over rice. \n\nFirst of all, I buttered my rice when it was cooking in step 1. This eliminates the need for it in the later part of step 2 and lends to a richer pudding. \n\nI generally watch the fat in my recipes, so I made mine with skim milk, which added another 6 or 7 minutes on to the total cooking time. I also increased the sugar a little, as I preferred it a bit sweeter (it's a matter of preference). But the main key is to add some of cooking pudding (from the pot) to a seperate bowl with the egg and milk mixture. This brings the egg and milk mixture to a warmer, more consistant temperature to what's in the pot and prevents the egg from scrambling. After about 3 minutes mixing them together in the bowl, slowly add the egg and milk mixture to the pot and continue cooking for about 2 minutes, until thickened.\n\nSprinkle it with a bit of cinnamon before serving. This pudding is delicious hot or cold. I will be making this recipe often. Thanks!",

I was skeptical, as I've always made rice pudding by cooking the rice in the milk, but it came out great-tasting, and the big bonus is that it's a great use for leftover rice!  And it doesn't make too much.  One warning--3/4 cup uncooked rice yields more than 1-1/2 cups cooked.  I used only 1-1/2 cups cooked, and think that any more would've taken away the creaminess.",
