I did see the words.. \"simmer until cranberries pop\" and decided to use \"frying screen\" over the pot. Thank goodness! LOL The recipe is marvelous as it is. Then I made it a 2nd time, using 1 bag cranberries, 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup of white sugar, 2/3 cup OJ and 1/4 cup of water. I couldn't justify boiling down Gran Manier, so I added 2 Tablespoons AFTER the berry mixture was done heating.  LUCIOUS!!!!  Remember to use a spatter screen and let the sauce set for at least 4 hours. Perfect consistancy and texture as well as flavors. YUM!",

But, my family loves to have it for their turkey, and I can't deny them that.  However, I figured I could make it from scratch and see if they liked that even better.  Boy, did they.  My hubby and 11 yr. old nephew were eating it by the spoonfuls!  I decided to give it a little taste since everyone was going on so much about it.  OMG!!!  It was awesome!  I couldn't believe the difference in having fresh cranberry sauce.  I will definitely have a little something at every holiday now to dress up my sliced turkey!  And I will never disgrace my family with the canned stuff again.  I took a few suggestions and used half white sugar, half brown, and added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  AMAZING!!!",
