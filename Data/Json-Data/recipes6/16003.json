I have used brie also and I like both but I have some goat cheese in the house that I want to use up so I used that. You can cut the amount of brie in half and still have leftover cheese. I ground the pecans in the food process or until they are like bread crumbs. That way they stick to the chicken better. And then I bake the chicken instead of frying. I bake it at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. I use raspberry jam for the sauce mixed with chambord. I melt the jam on the stove and add the chambord. It is really good and saves time. This is my go to fancy chicken recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "Might be the odd ball here, but I felt disappointed with this. The flavors just weren't there. I did things a little differently, however not so much with the ingredients really, as with the cooking method. Generally I get a bit weary about not cooking chicken all the way through which was my fear based on the instruction for frying for 15 minutes then again for another 15 mintues which in my mind would burn the outside shell of nuts, but not cook the inside. So after frying for 15 mintues first, I then threw it in the oven for 20 instead. The chicken came out very juicy, but bland. The cheese could hardly be tasted and the watery taste of the chicken dispersed the rasberry flavor. I will try this again with just frying like it calls, but I will use more oil than is being called for, fry  in a small pan and maybe cover it or something.  Also, someone mentioned that they had issues having the pecans stick to the chicken.  This was my other reason for putting it in the oven where there would not be a necessity to turn it over many times, hence making the pecans fall off. However, I think there is a fix for this.  This would involve crushing the nuts to almost a powder before covering the chicken. (If you like the crunchy texture, you can add some non crushed pecans to the sauce instead.) I have figured out from other recipes that a good way to make things stick is to dredge the chicken in a thin coat of flour first, then dredge in the egg and last roll it in the outsid",
