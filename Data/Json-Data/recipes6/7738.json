Husband waits around to \"clean\" the mixing bowl! This cake is very good, if out on counter and wrapped, for up to 3 days. Great as a dessert or for breakfast! Can sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on top, or eat it plain. Freezes nicely if wrapped well.",

I know oven temperatures can vary, but I\u2019d recommend that you start checking for doneness at 50 minutes; that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do in the future.  This is tasty, and I enjoyed the poppy seed flavor but just felt like something was missing.  I don\u2019t know, maybe some lemon zest and a little fresh lemon juice might  kick up the flavor a bit.  Served today with a dusting of confectioners sugar, but Florida strawberries are in season now, so this will get some sugared-berries over the top soaking into the cake tomorrow. I liked it well enough that I\u2019ll give it one more try.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
