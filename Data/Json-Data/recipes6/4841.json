We had kielbasa in the freezer that was starting to get old. So to make it smoked spicy we added 1tsp of sweet paprika 2 tsp Spanish smoked paprika 1 tsp fennel garlic salt and pepper and a touch of cayenne. I added all the spices when the sausage and onions were saut\u00e9ing 30 seconds to bloom the spices. Living in Michigan our outdoor garden is some time away so it had to be dried thyme but we had fresh chives from the window garden. These are the only changes we made his worked so well.
