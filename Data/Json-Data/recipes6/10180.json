Oh and I used a muffin pan with light spray of oil instead of paper cups because paper cups tend to stick way too much. Thank you!",

Also, I subbed1/4 of the almond meal (1/2 c.) with ground flax seed, which I always do with almond-based recipes to help retain a little more moisture. This is a fantastic foundation recipe to continue tweaking with the ingredients I have on hand. \n\nAlso, I used a mini-loaf pan (4 loaves instead of 1 large one) and they baked perfectly in 45 minutes. Grain-free quick breads often perform better in smaller baking sizes since the leavening agent has to do less work.",

Used small loaf pans and it filled 3 pans just over 1/2 way all cooked nicely in 45 mins. Due to picket eaters in my house one loaf was plain one with choc chip morsels one with choc morsels and walnuts. The choc chips definitely added needed sweetness and the walnuts topped off the yummy-ness. Agree with reviewer that this is a great base with which to experiment. Without chips would add more honey or other sweetener.",
