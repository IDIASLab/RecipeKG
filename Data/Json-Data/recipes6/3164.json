I sprayed them with non-stick cooking spray and set them in a pan to thaw for a few hours.  Then I cut them in half the long way with a kitchen scissors, and then made little chunks from those.  Then I followed the rest of this recipe except instead of pudding, I doubled the brown sugar and butter, added a teaspoon of vanilla and a cup of chopped walnuts.   I cooked that for a few minutes then poured it over my \"rolls\" I had in 9x13 glass pan because I don't own a bundt pan.  I left that to rise on it's own a couple of hours and baked it like the recipe says.   Wow, super yummy!  Just another idea is all.  Next time I'll try the pudding.",
