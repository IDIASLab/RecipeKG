You can lower the fat content by adding the optional raw potato. This method is for a food processor, but you can also use a meat grinder. You can also stuff the mixture into sausage casings.",

Using potatoes stretches the meat a substantial amount without affecting taste - as I don't really care about fat content. Mostly I use the sausage as a breakfast sausage in place of traditional \"Jimmy Dean\" style sage-dominated sausage. Also with a slice of cheese - like a hamburger. I find the inclusion of veal makes the product authentic. Potatoes have been used in locally produced brats for years in and around Sheboygan.",

I added fresh green onion and minced garlic after the dry seasoning had set with the meat (deviding the pepper between black and white pepper is also a nice kick). I like the veal idea however ask your butcher for the ribeye end of a porkloin which will give you more tender meat plus the fat content that you are looking for. I rolled the meat out on wax paper and use a cup to press out even patties...yet to have a complaint! great spring/summer recipe!!",
