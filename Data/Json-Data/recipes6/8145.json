I used 2/3 broth (a combination of chicken and vegetables broth ) to 1/3 water.  I also added 1 Tbs of cider vinegar near the end of simmering because I think kale benefits from some acid. This amount was not enough to be pronounced in flavor but enough to add that little something, something.   You have to add the acid near the end of cooking so it doesn\u2019t make your beans tough if using dry beans. If using canned beans it\u2019s a non issue.",
