It worked quite well for me, but I think it is VERY IMPORTANT that the whipped topping is folded in carefully, not mixed in vigorously. I mixed together the sugar, sour cream and coconut, whipped it a bit with a hand mixer and then let it chill for an hour so before folding in the Cool Whip. After I frosted the cake (and I had quite a bit left over after frosting a 9 inch layer cake), I refrigerated it and half expected the icing to be falling off the cake next time I checked, but it was perfectly intact and remained so the next day as well. And it tastes delicious!",

I put together about 2 cups of coconut the sour cream and used granulated sugar. I received one cup of it and mixed the one cup w/8 oz. of cool whip. The frosting w/out the coolwhip I used to frost my cake layers (I had made two 8-inch rounds and cut those into two so ended up w/four layers). It only took a thin layer. Then the frosting w/the coolwhip I used for the sides and top. I only used about 1/2 of the frosting. WOW!!! Between the butter cake and this frosting it was a 10! Thank you! My friends at work loved it and now everybody wants the recipe!",
