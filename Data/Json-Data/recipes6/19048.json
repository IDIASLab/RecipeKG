I didn't read the reviews until after I had them in the oven, and was slightly unnerved after reading how so many people pureed all of the strawberries or didn't like the texture with whole sliced strawberries.  I treated the strawberries exactly how the recipe intends and I am in LOVE with this dessert. I love the slightly strawberry taste of the brownies themselves, and the chunks of sliced strawberries are a fabulous addition.   I did use a box of brownie mix, though, because I was out of cocoa powder. I followed the \"fudge-like\" recipe on the box, minus the water. (so 2 eggs and oil. the strawberry purree essentially replaced the water)  The brownie mix I used was verrrry chocolately, which was wonderful, so if making from scratch I would recommend a strong chocolate taste (since I didn't use this brownie recipe, I can't many any suggestions in this regard).  I liked baking in a pie dish as well because of the thickness (so 8x8 square pan would also work well, but I would definitely not recommend a 9x13 pan.)",

In addition to the vanilla (I did use the full amount--LOVE vanilla!) I also added some chocolate extract and some natural strawberry flavoring. I also added more sugar because my strawberries were a little tart and because I also added more cocoa. I also added baking powder and salt and some chopped bittersweet chocolate. I baked in a 10x10 stoneware (King Arthur Flour original). The taste was very good and my family gave them a thumbs up.",

I should have just left it like that and left out the fresh berries. The consistency of the fresh berries cooked into the brownie batter just did not appeal to me at all. It was more of a texture problem for me than the taste. Also the brownie batter did need a strong chocolate taste IMHO. I will take the idea of pureeing some fruit with me from the recipe and use that in another recipe.",
