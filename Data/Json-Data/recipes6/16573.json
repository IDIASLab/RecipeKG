They are a nice lightly sweet dinner roll that could only be improved if they were more labor intensive...(kneading the dough would make them airier and a lighter bread) Although the dough needs to rise an hour making these rolls is \"quick\" in a sense because after mixing the batter all you do is let it rise while you go about doing other things. There is an easy recipe.. good for young cooks first foray into the world of bread making.",

However, these rolls had a great yeasty flavor and were very dense.  I wouldn't use all the flour--just as needed. I also baked them at 350 for 15 minutes rather than 425 and they came out fine.  A good, hearty roll.",
