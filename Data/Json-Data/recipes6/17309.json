I topped it with a chocolate glaze. It was super easy to make, the batter was extremely runny, but baked perfectly. I used a bundt pan and cooked it about 50 minutes. This chocolate cake tasted and looked just like a chocolate cake. Very pleased with this recipe and have already recommended it to friends. Super easy to make and delicious too!!!  here it is over a year later and I am still making this cake, I just made it twice in the past week. I used the Hershey's recipe for their perfectly chocolate chocolate icing on top, my best friend told me it was divine! It never lasts in this house or when I take it somewhere. Its a keeper!\n\nTo those who say the cake is gummy with a weird texture , I have made it enough times to know it doesn't always turn out right. I have found that if I over mix the mayo chocolate mixture the cake doesn't rise right and is gummy. To avoid this use room temp mayo and mix chocolate, mayo, vinegar and extract til creamy. If it looks shiny and curdled the cake will be gummy. HTH :)",
