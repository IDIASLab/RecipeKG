IMO it\u2019s that good, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything.  That particular reviewer gave it 5 stars, but seriously, she wasn\u2019t reviewing this recipe, only her custom version.  The selection of beans is interesting, eye appealing, and just tasty!  I was a little concerned that the sauce might be too sweet for our taste, but it was the perfect blend.  I love baked beans, have cooked them many different ways (including slow cooked), and I honestly can say that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had better!",
