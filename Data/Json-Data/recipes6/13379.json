I noted others and cut the meringue mix down by one egg white and it was still way too much so I decided to pipe it onto parchment paper instead of putting it into a pie dish. When I tried to move it onto a serving dish it crumbled like crazy. How it would have been in a dish I can't imagine. I used key lime juice instead of lemon but the flavor was very thin and watery - it had no depth to the flavor. I played around with it and added more lime and a little more liquid sugar but it just ended up like some nasty instant pudding mix. I am going to crumble the meringue and fold it into whipped cream and serve with strawberries. Taste good but not the special pie I wanted for Easter. Gonna go now and make Chantals cheesecake!

The meringue crust was way too much for one pie shell but because I had never made anything like it before wasn't sure so just went with it. To me 8 servings for a pie means it is one pie this recipe easily made enough for 2. The filling was good I tasted as I went so added a bit less sugar and a bit more lemon and it was perfect I'll definitely be making that part of it again. But then I folded in the whipped cream and it never set. In the end I had a lemon pudding in a store bought crust for my family for dessert - not exactly what I was looking for.",
