Here's what I did: Used Italian bread from the bakery (French bread seemed like too much crust). I also whipped 1 1/2 bricks cream cheese w/ 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and spread it over the cubed bread. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) and only 10 eggs. I also made sure to press the bread down so that everything got french toast consistancy. The syrup is delicious!! I made 1.5 times and poured 2/3 of it over the dish and the other 1/3 was put on the table for those who wanted a little bit more. Overall, this is a great recipe!! Will be sure to make at my next brunch. Thank you!",

I try to only give feedback that I think is truly helpful, so here are my suggestions. 1. Make sure you use a good hearty bread like an Italian or French loaf from the bakery. If you use basic loaf bread, it will be way too soggy. You do not want a soft or delicate bread. 2. After placing the first layer of bread, sprinkle with cinnamon for more flavor. 3. After reading many reviews, I decided to mix 1.5 blocks of cream cheese with 1/4 c. of powdered sugar and then spread it on the bread.  I thought it was still hard to spread, so next time I will add a little milk to thin it out. Maybe also a dash of vanilla. 3. I used frozen blueberries (thawed) & they worked well.  You could also definitely use more than a cup in the middle of the french toast. 4. After placing the 2nd layer of bread, sprinkle with cinnamon again. 5. I thought the blueberry sauce was lacking a certain wow factor, so I added a little fresh lemon juice. This definitely gave it what I thought had been missing.  Overall, this was very good with modifications and would be great when you have have company. Next time, I will make this with strawberries instead, and I'm betting it will taste like a breakfast version of strawberry shortcake!",

I added a little milk and whipped the cream cheese and spread it on the slices of bread.  A little messy but it was evenly distributed.  I also took the advice of others and doubled the amount of blueberries in the syrup and in the dish itself.  Atleast use one and a half the blueberries when making it.  I cut the sugar in the syrup to 3/4 cup - it was plenty sweet.  I added a dsh of cinnamon and nutmeg to the syrup too.  I still had a request to get out the regular maple syrup.  All in all, a very easy dish that is a little different from the standard egg casseroles so often served for a crowd at breakfast or brunch.  I would make this again - next time I will try strawberries.",

The cinnamon really makes it smells great baking. Everyone loves it. This is a staple in our house for Christmas morning or anytime I have friends or relatives visiting.

Then I added my *\"cream cheese mixture\" over top, then topped with the blueberries.  The next morning I used a knife and very gently swirled some of the cream cheese mixture into the casserole, not to incorporate, just to allow the cream cheese mixture to soak down a bit. It made a beautiful presentation.  I will definitely make this one over and over.  *(cream cheese mixture: 2 8oz Cream cheese and 3/4 c. sugar, cream well.  Add 1 egg and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice.  Cream well.)  I hope you try this change.  This is now one of my favorite breakfast casseroles.  Of course...fruit is an option.  (with strawberries it would be amazing too!)  :)",
