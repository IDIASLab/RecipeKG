I wanted to give it a chance but it did seem like a lot of eggs and a lot of milk so I halved both added a tablespoon of flour and sprinkled in some cinnamon for good measure. It took another 10 mins in the oven for it to set and it almost overflowed my pie pan (I used a storebought graham cracker crust--perhaps it's smaller than a 9 inch pie round) but it did end up with a nice final result. The pie was custardy and set and wasn't too eggy. You can tell there's milk in it but it's not overwhelming and the peaches kind of float to the top so you have a layer of custard topped by peaches. Very nice actually! Kind of like a peaches and cream pie although not exactly. I'm glad I adjusted it but this is a good base recipe--not too sweet. Thanks for the recipe!",
