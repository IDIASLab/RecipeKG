I also added pecans which gave it a little twist of additional flavor.",

First, I roasted them with olive oil and salt at 375 for about 20 minutes, stirred and then turned the temp up on the oven to 425 for another ten minutes or so, or until tender.  I then heated about two tablespoons of butter in a skillet on med high heat and added the carrots as well as two to three tablespoons of maple syrup. I let it bubble a little bit, stirring frequently, and the butter and syrup carmelized together, forming a very tasty, carmel.  I served immediately.  They were great like this!",

Aside from the amounts listed not being enough maple syrup and butter the texture of the sauce was quite runny compared to the way I make it and also more expensive to make. I use butter or margarine along with either light or brown sugar with my carrots and they are so much better and also less expensive to make. I then add parsley to them primarily to dress them up and make them more appetizing to look at. I will continue to make what I call \"candied carrots\" using my method.",
