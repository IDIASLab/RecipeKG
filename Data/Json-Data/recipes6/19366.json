Leave one out and you'll get something completely different. I recommend moving dates to a paper towel after cooking to blot briefly before plating and drizzling with balsamic.",

The second time I did them for about 20 minutes and then stuck them under the broiler on low and flip them so it was five minutes on each side on a low broiler. The next time I make these I am just going to do the low broil or from the start and keep an eye on them",
