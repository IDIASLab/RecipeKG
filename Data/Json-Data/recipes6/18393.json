I decided to try and make it more carb friendly and so I used splenda for baking instead of sugar and half and half instead of milk. I followed the rest of the directions to a T and was very impressed with the final product. The only thing is, I was expecting it to be more pudding like, and when I added the whipped cream it turned out more like, well, whipped cream. I tasted it before I added the whipped cream and it was amazing. This could be used in boston cream pie or as pudding if it is made without the whipped cream. It could be used for cream puffs or other pastries as is. My lower carb version turned out fabulous. I give this recipe an A+.",

                "reviewBody": "To someone that has never made custard of any kind before, this recipe is slightly confusing.  I have made this twice.  The first time, I followed all directions and ingredients exactly.  I believe I overcooked the custard because I was using a plastic spoon, not a metal one.  It is difficult to tell when the mixture coats the spoon, so metal works best.  Overcooking resulted in the yolk of the egg scrambling.  The second mistake I made was with the straining.  The recipe does not indicate which portion to keep when straining and because my egg cooked I had a significant amount in the strainer as well as in the bowl under it.  I did not know which part to keep and I believe I used the wrong part of the custard for the remainder of the recipe.  My end result was very little flavor and bits of solid pieces in my Bavarian Cream.  However, the second time that I made it with the metal spoon, I took the mixture off the stove as soon as the back was becoming coated.  I strained it and it became obvious that the portion to keep is the liquid that comes out of the strainer.  I used this to complete the recipe and it turned out beautifully.  We used the Bavarian Cream to make delicious filled homemade donuts for breakfast.  Probably a novice mistake overall, but I feel the author should have indicated exactly what to do after straining the mixture.",

It could be that I did something wrong, but I reviewed the recipe again after I was finished to make sure I did everything right and... well the result just wasn't very good at all. :(",
