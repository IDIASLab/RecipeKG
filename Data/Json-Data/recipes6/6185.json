        "description": "This is a vegetarian version of the traditional Persian stew, which normally includes lamb. Though I have never traveled east of London, this dish has become my primary comfort food. I had to learn how to make it when I moved to Canada, and couldn't find a Persian restaurant that served it. Saag paneer, which also relies on the flavor of fenugreek, is slightly similar, but ghormeh sabzi traditionally contains no dairy products and is made with herbs (cilantro, parsley) instead of spinach, so it's really quite different, and in my opinion, much tastier. Serve with Persian tahdig rice or, if you are going low-carb, serve with quinoa or wild rice.",
