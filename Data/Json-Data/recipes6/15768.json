I stumbled upon this recipe and found I had most of the ingredients it called for and it only took 30 minutes to prepare!  The only variations I made were using minced garlic & a little garlic powder, a whole yellow onion (since I did not have any green onions), and I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce & salt to taste.  I was impressed!  I'll definitely make this again!!",
