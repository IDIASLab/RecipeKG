I chose this recipe in the first place and decided to follow it exactly because I've come across this submitter's name several times either with her recipes or with her reviews and have always found she knows what she's doing! If Michelleca says it I respect it and I follow it! I used this batter for muffins and baked them at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. What the avocado doesn't contribute in flavor is more than made up for by what it contributes in richness and moistness. Because it is a neutral flavor the bread (or muffins in my case) picks up the flavor of whatever additions you make. In this case the orange flavor is prominent with a hint of cinnamon and spice - very pleasant. It is the addition of the orange zest pecans and raisins that really make this extraordinarily delicious and I would suggest not to leave any of it out. The bread is not quite green but definitely a different color. It is beautifully flecked with the pecans nuts raisins and specks of orange zest and green avocado. I loved the recipe just as written but the mildness of the avocado lends this to any number of flavor or fruit variations. I topped the muffins with sparkling sugar before they went in the oven which gave them a sweet sparkly crunch. Once again Michelleca you have come up with something good!",
