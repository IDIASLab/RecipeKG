I agreed with the lady that said there was no way she was going to cook potatoes for 2.5 hours!  I have real good chicken soup base, where chicken is the first ingredient.  The first thing I did was boil the potatoes in the chicken stock.   Since some people commented that the potatoes were a little bland, I added a couple chunks of garlic to the stock.  Between the stock and the garlic, I knew it would give the potatoes a great start.  I cooked them until they were ALMOST done.  Then I drained them and put them in a baking dish.  In another bowl, I added the olive oil, (NO water!)zest of an entire big lemon after microwaving it for 30 seconds to make it juicier and all the contents of that lemon.  I added fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden along with some Greek oregano and fresh ground black pepper and a little salt.  I baked them uncovered for about half hour stirring them half way through and they were delicious!  We had company for dinner I and wanted something to go with the Souvlaki and this was perfect!  They had had lot of flavor and you could taste a hint of the lemon.  They were as good as I've had in the Greek restaurants and they didn't take long to prepare! I'll definately be making these again.  ",

The potatoes were good the first time, GREAT the 2nd time.  This is a definite keeper",

I mixed everything (potatoes & seasonings, oil, etc.)together and then added only enough chicken broth to moisten everything (1 1/2 cups would be way too much in my opinion).  Roasted them as directed...be sure to start testing at 1 hour if your potatoes are cut into small pieces.  Delicious!",

I only used half of the oil, half of the water, double the fresh lemon juice, used 3 cubes of vegetable bouillon, and used 4 garlic cloves.  I also boiled the potatoes prior to placing them in the oven to boil off some of the starches and reduce cooking time.  In the end, the potatoes still took about an hour and 10 minutes.  The potatoes were amazingly delicious and would definitely make them again.  Thanks!",
