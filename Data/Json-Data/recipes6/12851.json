It produced a nice consistancy drop dough due to having a very hot oven I shortened the cooking time to 10 minuets which produced a beautiful golden brown bottom. The upper side was nearly white the flavor delicate but lacked something to make them memorable and equivalant to the rest of my Holiday cookie tray. I'd say this is a good everyday cookie for those who like the flavor of anise but find the Italian cookies too pungent with the anise oil used (which I prefer). A good cookie to be served with strong coffee.",
