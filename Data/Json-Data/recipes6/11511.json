It was plenty sweet, I used homemade jarred apple pie filling. We all ate it last night for a treat, then hubby and I finished it off for breakfast this morning. Delicious! The only substitution I would make, which I always do, is to use unsweetened applesauce in place of the vegetable oil. I do this in any recipe calling for oil. It turns out just as moist and is waaaay healthier. Great recipe!",

The cake was finished baking in 35 minutes, any longer and it would have been dried out.  For a simple cake, without any icing, this was wonderful.
