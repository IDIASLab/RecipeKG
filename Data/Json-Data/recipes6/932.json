These cookies are soft, chewy and so, so delicious.  If you love the combination of coconut and dark chocolate you should make a batch of these, stat!  I followed the recipe as written except I added the yogurt to the wet ingredients, instead of at the end, and I used quick cook oats.  You may be tempted to add more chocolate chips but don't, otherwise you will end up with too many mix-ins and not enough dough to hold the cookies together.  These are a decadent treat.",

The mingled flavors of coconut and chocolate are excellent (I used sweetened coconut flakes and semi-sweet chips because it's what I had in the pantry), and the chunky texture given by the oatmeal makes for a hearty, dense, chewy cookie. I gave it four stars only because they were a little dry (but I used butter, not margarine)- but went down great with a glass of cold milk! Will definitely be making these again and again. I think next time I may add some almond pieces...mmmm....",

I made these changes; subbed some applesauce for some of the fat,used butter because that's what I had, added 1/2 tsp baking powder so they would be a little lighter, higher, used 1/2 cup Stevia in place of some of the sugar, used 2 cups ch chips and 1 cup coconut. These were great looking and tasting, kind of rustic and moist and chewy. Great flavor! Will be making again!",
