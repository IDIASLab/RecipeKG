I made the recipe as written with minor substitutes and cook time adjustment due to the amount of meat I had. The only substitutes I made were using canned Chipotle sauce as the Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce were out of stock (used 3 tbsp sauce and probably should have added another 1-2 tbsp), and corn tortillas as that's our preference. I had about 4.5lb pork butt and cooked for 45 min with 15-20 min natural pressure release. Since I made this the night before, I saved the juices in the pot in another container to reheat the meat in the oven so it wouldn't dry out. This recipe is the only one I will make going forward for al pastor. Thank you for the recipe!",

Have been a little intimidated by the traditional spit roasting, so looked up a recipe that was a little more accessible. \n\nThis is so so good. Does not taste like what my restaurant serves, but I will definitely make it again. \n\nI forgot fresh garlic and didn\u2019t have minced, so I used a liberal tablespoon. Also was liberal with the cumin. \n\nI used two pounds of meat and cut into smaller chunks, so I only pressure cooked for 30 minutes. I used fresh pineapple, and after shredding meat and adding pineapple, I sprayed with cooking oil to help with browning under the broiler. I definitely went more than 5 minutes, but I stirred it a few times. My favorite parts of the meat are always the super crispy parts. \n\nDownfall: just a smidge too spicy. My kids will not eat it. Next time I will only add one chipotle. I served it with caramelized onions, fresh cilantro, Monterrey Jack cheese, and lime wedges.  \n\nAlso: So as to not waste the extra pineapple juice and chipotle peppers leftover, I made a second batch of marinade and froze it. I actually added a bit more chipotle peppers to that batch.... so most definitely will either use more meat or plan on feeding the kids something else.",

I tried it with pork loin because my grocery store only sold pork butt in huge quantities, and I wanted something a bit less fatty. I figured it wouldn't change much -- I was wrong. I followed the instructions exactly and didn't adjust the cooking time. The pork was cooked fine but the sauce turned out very weird and separated, so I didn't want to pour it over the meat. As a result the pork was quite dry. I know this is my fault for not following the recipe, but I'm still giving it 3 stars because the flavor simply is not like true tacos as pastor.

I had high hopes given some ingredients I had never used before (sazon and chipotle peppers in adobo) but sadly, that elusive pastor flavor just wasn't there. Plus, it was a heckuva lot of work! To me it was much closer to a pulled pork sandwich in flavor than a Mexican pastor taco.  Kudos, however, for the high pressure method which did indeed create perfectly fall apart meat. Note: I marinated for about 9 hours -- no doubt it might have been better to marinate even longer but I still don't think the flavor would be there. Search continues for at-home pastor...",
