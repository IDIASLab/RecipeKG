I let it rise,  then shaped and baked for 30 min at 350. The bread came out great with a wonderful texture, but the rosemary taste was a bit heavy -- I would reduce that next time.\nUpdate: made it again this year with fresh out-of-the-garden kohlrabi and rosemary. This time, I used my food processor to make the puree and used fresh minced rosemary -- probably a full tablespoon. Then I misread the recipe and put in 2 T instead of 2 t of yeast. Didn't change the taste, but it sure rose fast and high! Baked for 35 minutes and it came out beautifully! It is not a sweet bread that hides the taste of the veggie -- you absolutely get the kohlrabi and rosemary taste! (Good toasted, with eggs and mushrooms for breakfast!)",

The dough was also VERY wet, I ended up sprinkling flour during the kneading cycle until it finally formed a ball. I did not meassure how much extra flour I added but my best guesstimate would be close to 3/4 of a cup. All in all, if I find myself with a kohlrabi in my hands, would love to make again.",
