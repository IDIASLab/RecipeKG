I stated that these were time consuming and I certainly wasn't kidding because I'm making them now as I'm writing. \"Prairie Dixie\" I give you so much credit for saying that you'll be making this every fall for the rest of your life. I haven't made my own recipe in several years and I now know why!! I am however making 32 of them so it's taking a bit of time. I just wanted to say that some of my raw \"knoedels\" were sticking to the plate and breaking open the dough so I went back and used cooking spray on the plate. It helped a lot. I hope my Oma is looking down and smiling at me because I'm definitely looking up at her and appreciating all of her efforts and of course love. Happy cooking gang!",

Thanks so much Linda Caleb and I had such fun making this. It was messy but so worth it! (See posted pics). You're as sweet as a sugar cube! (: Love you! Day Original review: This recipe is so awesome and I was extremely pleased to see such a treasured heirloom recipe submitted here. My family used to make peach dumplings like this but I thought the sugarcube in the center was such a nice touch! It added an extra sweetness to an already wonderful recipe! The best recipes in the world are the ones made with love and time and this is definately one of those recipes. Thank you so much Linda for sharing this recipe!",

As soon as I saw this I had to try them and am I ever glad I did. These are even better than my Grandma used to make and make sure you make lots I have already made 6 batches and am still getting requests for more. The only thing I changed is that we don't serve them with bread crumbs I mix sour cream with sugar and spoon it over luke warm dumplings. I also used much more flour than called for to get the dough a consistency for rolling. Thanx so much for the recipe Linda I will be using it every fall for the rest of my life! I just wish plums were in season all year.",
