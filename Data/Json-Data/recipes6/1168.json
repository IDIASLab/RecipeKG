I trimmed most of the fat from the pork chunks to make it a little more healthy.  I skipped the fennel, husband isn't a fan, but included everything else.  While I wish I had a mortar and pestle to make the paste, sadly I don't (yet) so I could only stir all the rub ingredients together.  Good news, it turned out better than fine.  I wasn't sure my husband and 2 teenage boys would like the beans and greens, I think it is safe to say they were a hit since I had to make another batch to go with their second helping of pork - they devoured 4 cans of beans!   I considered subbing spinach and glad I didn't.  The best bites included the pork, beans and greens altogether.  We drizzled some of the pork juice on top, was soooo good.  Only thing I would do different next time is serve it with some warm crusty bread (and butter) - still mad at myself for forgetting to buy a loaf.\n\nMake this, you won't be disappointed.  This might actually be my all time favorite allrecipes.com meal.  I also just found my new go to method for cooking roasts, beats the crock pot everyday.",
