I added about 1 cup of onions and one teaspoon of minced garlic to the oil and butter and cooked over medium heat in a saucepan.  Then I added the basil, pepper, and chicken broth to the saucepan.  Meanwhile I cooked and drained some angel hair pasta.  I decided I wanted the sauce to be creamy, so in a smaller saucepan I made a white sauce with 1 cup of milk, 2 tbsp. of butter, and 2 tbsp. of Wondra flour.  Once that had thickened I slowly stirred it into the onion mixture.  I let it simmer together for a few minutes, added more salt and pepper, then began to spoon the pasta into the sauce until it was just the right consistency.  It was so yummy!  It was super creamy and my husband loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe, Jackie!",

My daughter wouldn't touch it and my boyfriend picked out half the onions but my roommate and I really enjoyed it - any onion lover would.  Not the best but a quick, easy, and tasty dish indeed!",

Quite creative too I would never have thought of using carmelized onions over pasta but it works for me! The only reason I am not giving this recipe a 5-star rating is that in my opinion it has a lot more oil and butter than necessary. It gives it an overly greasy feel. Next time I will cut down on the oil and I am sure it will be more to my taste.",

Now I make it simply because we love it so much. This is an absurdly easy to prepare yet deceptively delicious meal. The only change I make is to cut WAY back on the butter and oil (that's the only reason why I ding it by one star); I use just enough butter to grease the pan, and give the onions a little moisture. Oh, I usually use 2 large strong-tasting onions for 2 servings. This is a superb recipe. Thanks so much, Jackie!",
