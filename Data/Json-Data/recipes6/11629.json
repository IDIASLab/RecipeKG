My boyfriend said it tasted just like pumpkin pie and he would have thought it was if it had a crust. It's very creamy but way fluffier than pumpkin pie. My only complaint is that I just about overdosed on all the spices. Their flavor was overpowering and they take away from the mousse's smooth texture. Next time I make this (and I will definitely make it again) I will either use pre-made p.p. spice or I will reduce everything except the cinnamon by half.",

The Crystallized Ginger overwhelmed this dish I would omit this if I choose to doctor it up the next time. Ginger is a very strong hot flavor I don't suggest using it at the bottom of the dish. If you must use it finely chop up only 1 tbs and place it throughout the Mousse. Update: Dec 16 2010 two cups of mouse still sit in my fridge.
