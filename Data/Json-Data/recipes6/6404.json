All I did was coat the florets with the mixture and scatter them onto a half sheet pan with a medium gauge  rack on it.  Because there was a lot of liquid that drained through, I dumped the mixture back into my bowl using it to put half of the florets back in while I used a plastic zip lock bag to coat the first batch in the crumbs.  I used half of the crumbs for the first batch, then the other half for the second batch.  I just drained the 2nd batch of florets before putting them in the ziplock.\nOnce I  put them onto the rack, I made sure they were flat and let them bake for 15 minutes.  When the 15 minutes were up, I  switched the oven to broil, high and let it broil for 5 minutes.\nThe result was a perfectly breaded and crispy morsel of AMAZING!  I WILL be making this over and over again!  Oh my word!  These are so good!",

I lazily stick with store bought ranch dressing. \nThe fist time I made the recipe I followed the directions. \nThe second time I reduced the mayonnaise by 1 tablespoon to bring out more of the buffalo sauce flavor/spice. I used cornbread bread crumbs in place of croutons.  I also cook them longer, maybe about 25-30 minutes, till they are golden brown. \nI really enjoy this recipe. Thank you",

If you like your \"wings\" spicy, I would add a little more hot sauce.  I also left the cauliflower in the oven about 5-10 minutes longer (or until they were golden brown).
