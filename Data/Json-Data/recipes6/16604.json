Have made it weekly for the past four weeks. Once forgot the butter and it was still great. Just to have some micro times to go by: I cooked the sugar, water, and karo in the micro on high for 7 minutes. then add the other items and cook on 50% for 9 minutes. After beating and pouring, it is perfect. Sometimes I make a huge patty and break it up after it gets hard and sometimes make in individual patties. Always perfect and always disappear quickly. thank you so much for this recipe!!!",

The recipe is great I m sure. I haven t made candy in forever. The candy spilled over in the microwave and though I had a high powe microwave I couldn t get it to lighten when whipped. In desperation I added some baking soda and it started to thicken and lighten. Poured it out and when it cooled tried it. I think I reinvented Bit O Honey. Wasn t peanut patties but still gave me my sweet fix. Thought I d share my mistake in case anyone was craving Bit O Honey. Thanks for the recipe!",
