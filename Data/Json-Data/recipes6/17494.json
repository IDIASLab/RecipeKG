TIP:  Top warm cookies with COOL syrup  OR  Top cool cookies with WARM syrup  The best way to finish these is to place cookies into a large baking pan-just large enough to fit all of the ccookies.  The pan should have sides.  I use a 13 x 9\" pan.    Place the cookies in the pan, pour syrup over all and allow them to absorb.    Syrup should come 1/3 up the side of the pan. (The same rule applies when making Baklava)   It will take at least 1 hour to absorb.  Store them in this pan covered with foil, then gently remove to serve.  This will keep them very moist!  Opa!",

I'm so glad I can make them at home since I don't have access to a lot of Greek bakeries. Just make sure you don't boil the syrup too long or you'll end up with a candy coating on the cookies. Fresh-squeezed orang juice greatly improves the cookie's flavor too.",

Make sure your syrup isnt TOO hot otherwide the cookies tend to fall apart and instead of just dunking them in and pulling them right out my mom always let them simmer for maybe 2-3 seconds....also the cookies are much better after they sit for a day or so and the moisture from the syrup penetrates evenly. The person that said they are dry probably ate them right away.",

I soaked in 9x13 pan as suggested here but the top of the cookie will stick to the pan if left longer than 15 minutes. 15 was enough. If you dip the top in sauce and then immediately roll the top on walnuts they stick on better than if you sprinkled the walnuts. It also holds more of the sauce on top. It was worth trying but not my favorite cookie. I don't think I'll make them again. My rating would be 3 1/2 stars but we don't do halves here. Some call these Easter cookies and they look nice in pastel colored muffin cups. Will post photo. I think these are also called Melomakarona cookies without the alcohol.",
