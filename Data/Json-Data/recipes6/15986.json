This dough needed a half cup more flour to get it into a solid ball that could be kneaded with the dough hook. I kneaded the dough with the hook for about five minutes. After kneading I set the dough to rise on a warm heating pad covered in a greased bowl for an hour. After the dough doubled I plopped the dough out of the bowl formed the dough into knots as the recipe stated then set them to rise on greased baking sheets on the warm heating pad again for a half-hour. After baking I brushed every knot with vegetable oil to give it a soft top. These turned out BEAUTIFUL. This was a slow rising dough but the end result was wonderful--light and fluffy with the best flavor. It's a little sweet for a dinner roll for us but honestly big deal. This would make an excellent breakfast sweet roll. GREAT recipe!",

When I make breads I turn the oven on to its lowest setting place the dough inside they rise beautifully and take less time to double. But make sure you place a clean damp kitchen town on top of the bowl or the dough will develop a crust which will prevent it from rising properly.",

I divided the dough into thirds then divided each third into 16 balls. Went a lot faster than making knots but the two knots I did make were great too. Just make sure not to add too much flour and overknead or the dough will become tough. It is not the smooth playdough type of bread dough.",
