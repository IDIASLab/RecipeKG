                "reviewBody": "Wonderful recipe!  A little messy but way worth the time.  I suggest four indispensable tools to tackle this recipe: a medium to large non-stick saucepan, a candy thermometer, a non-stick silicone-coated spoon or spatula and a good standing-electric mixer. I used a decent 3-quart non-stick saucepan to heat the simple syrup mixture.  It worked wonders, especially after adding the softened gelatin.  The cooled substance causes the syrup to foam substantially.  The larger saucepan accomodated well.  (Hint: a package of unflavored gelatin equals the amount needed for the recipe.) The trick to keeping the syrup and gelatin from separating is to mix it thoroughly before setting it aside.  My 5-quart KitchenAid helped to whip the whites into the beautiful marshmallow fluff.  Won't say it can't be done with a hand mixer, but I'd try half a batch at a time and recruit another set of hands to help pour the syrup/gelatin mixture into the soft-peaked egg whites.  \r\n\r\nI just recently learned what a See's Candies Scotch Kiss is (marshmallow wrapped in soft caramel).  This recipe produces marshmallows quite similar in texture and taste (soft/light and not too sweet).  I used the Caramels by Barbara recipe to envelope the marshmallows.  YUM!  I WILL make these for Christmas!!!  :-)",

I hope the following details are helpful for others.\nIt is easy when you break it down \u2013 Start with the sugar mixture.  While the sugar is boiling to temperature, then work on the gelatin.  While the gelatin melts, then work on the egg whites.  Don\u2019t forget to check the sugar syrup intermittently since once it reaches 245, it will quickly go to 260.  Also this is much easier to do in a stand mixer than with a hand mixer.  The amount of \u201cfluff\u201d is a lot.\n\n*Sugar syrup \u2013 Use a large saucepan or small stock pot. It will make it easier to add the gelatin mixture later.  It takes about 15 minutes to get the syrup to temperature over medium/medium-high heat.\n  \n*Blooming the gelatin - Put 3/4 cup of COLD water in a small saucepan and sprinkle each tablespoon (or envelope) of gelatin over the water slowly in an even layer.  Let rest for 3-5 minutes.  Place the saucepan over low heat and stir until the gelatin mixture is totally liquid.  Keep over low heat if this liquefies before the syrup is ready.\n\n*Egg whites \u2013 Once gelatin is liquid, put whites in bowl Beat until soft peaks form.  Turn off mixer while finishing the sugar-gelatin mixture.  Turn the mixer back on to low speed before adding the sugar mixture in a steady stream.  (It may be easier to transfer the sugar-gelatin mixture to a large measuring cup before beginning to pour. I have an 8-cup one tha",

We planned on making it strictly according to the recipe, but once we realized how involved it was (for marshmallows, anyway), we decided to skip the vanilla and go with the peppermint and red food coloring idea.  The results were fantastic.  Now we wonder why they don't sell peppermint marshmallows in the store.  It tastes great by itself or with hot chocolate or a latte.  I did use a large bowl when mixing the syrup and gelatin (the other reviewers were right-it really does explode like a science experiment!)  And the hot water really does help with cutting and clean up.  This recipe, in peppermint form, is a keeper.  Too much trouble in the regular version, I think.",
