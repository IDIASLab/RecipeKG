I let the bread sit with the berries about 20 minutes before combining with other ingredients. As per another reviewer's suggestion I added some ground cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves. I think this really gave added flavor to this dish. Sooo goood!!!! After baking I had no soggy spots are crusty edges. I've never like bread pudding before because of the raisins and the eggy taste. But this recipe is very tasty! I will be making this again since it is strawberry season now.",

I put it in the oven for 10 minutes. I also add 4 eggs instead of 3. I make it in a larger pan 9 x 12 and add more bread and strawberries and I add fresh blueberries. I don't increase the milk and cream except I use 1 cup cream. I think the cream is important for richness. I decrease sugar to 1/2 c. Comes out perfect and can be reheated just before serving if done earlier. I also keep it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before baking. I did it in the morning and left it 6 hours in the refrigerator and it was great.",
