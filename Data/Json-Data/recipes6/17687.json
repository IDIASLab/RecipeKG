I did make some minor changes, first of all I creamed the butter, shortening, and sugar for 25 mins, it was so light and fluffy( that is the secert to a great cake base).Then I added 1 egg at a time and beat for 30 seconds apeice. I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract.I also added 1 tablespoon of corn starch for each cup of flour (the cornstarch turns the all-purpose flour into cake flour). Last but not least I made some sour milk by adding 1 tablespoon of vinger and 1/4 teaspoon of vinger to the milk and let it turn while I was creaming the first 3 ingredients ( sour milk is just homemade buttermilk) Also start and end with the dry ingredients. Do not over beat when you start adding the dry ingredients or the cake will be tough. I baked the cake at 325 dregrees for 90 mins, but start checking after 60 mins. The last 20 mins I tented the cake with foil shinny side up away from the cake. Ummmmm, ummmm, good this cake was not dense at all it was so light, best pound cake to date.",

I used all butter instead of butter and shortening and reduced the milk by about 40ml since butter has 15% water compared to shortening.  Also reduced sugar to 2 1/4 cups.  As with other reviewers, had to cover the cake at  about 40 min. since the crust was already browned and only cooked it for just over an hour.  Very moist, soft, fine crumb cake.",

This recipe was sooooo easy to follow!! I was trying to re-create a birthday cake recipe that is a childhood memory. I knew the old recipe was a pound cake, and I was hoping with all the great reviews this cake would live up. It did! I frosted it with the \"Special Buttercream\" recipe from this site and it was amazing! I made a Barbie doll cake with the wilton wonder mold.\n\nLet's talk about the cake though: baked in 90 minutes, came out with a golden crust that was perfect for frosting b/c there were NO crumbs. When the cake was cut into, you could SEE how moist it was! The flavor is not sweet at all, and was a great balance with the sweet buttercream frosting. It was alomst white (which I loved!) Could that be b/c I used clear vanilla extract? I dunno, I had it on hand so I used it. Either way, I loved the color! I loved how easy it was to bake, and I loved how great it tasted! Thank you very much for sharing and I know this recipe will be used over and over again for many years to come!",

I have also make 1 1/2 the recipe to make four 8\" round pans 2\" high (generously). I would think it will make three 8\" rounds with one batch.",

I also added 10g of emulsifier and the zest of 1 orange. I beat it with the lowest speed to get a fine texture. It was ready after only 45 mins but the outside crust was a little too brown for my liking. Next time I will reduce the temp to 150-160 C and bake it for 30-40 mins.",
