I have wanted to make them for the longest time and am glad that they turned out like I had hoped. They are on the rotation list now. My changes: I used applesauce instead of the oil. Used chai tea in place of the black tea. Added about 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I topped the 12 standard size cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting with a dash of cinnamon and about 1T chocolate malt powder. (I didn't measure.)",
