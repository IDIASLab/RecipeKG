My aunt who is a master baker recommended I chop up the fresh cranberries to make them less tart (worked perfectly) and also used a whole orange (peel and all) in the food processor. The peel gave it extra flavor and a great substitute for orange extract.  Also, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream as that is all I had. I will definitely make this again.",

Baked in two loaf pans for 50 mins. and it is totally awesome. Moist and delicious and one flavour doess not overpower any other.  It's wonderful!  This is in my recipe box with a star on it!!",
