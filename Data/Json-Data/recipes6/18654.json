Pureeed the mixture till smooth and strained it. Then I chilled the mixture. Excellent.",

Nothing at all like real Horchata I grew up in my Mexican household. I had to add about 3 more quarts of water (and consequently another few cups of sugar)to make the drink thin enough and sweet enough to drink. In the end it still tasted like pureed rice pudding and not like Horchata. I was skeptical when reading this recipe at first because of the directions to cook the rice. I knew that would make it very starchy but proceeded anyway. I was very disappointed. I guess the hunt still continues for a good Horchata recipe.:-(",
