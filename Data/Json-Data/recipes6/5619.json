I didn't have any fish stock, so instead I used two cans of chicken broth. The only other change I made was that I backed way off on the pepper and the dill, only a teaspoon each. (To each his own.) This turned out very well, very rich full bodied flavor and very satisfying. The flavors of the bacon, veggies and salmon all came through together without needing so much spice, otherwise I would have given it a 5. I will put this in the rotation and the only change I would make would be to use the fish stock. Wife was happy and said to put it in the \"do again\" file. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for THE ABSOLUTE BEST cooking website.",

I also used chicken broth as many other readers had done. In addition I had the dill weed but it didn't seem appealing so I substituted it with freshly chopped kale which really was superb. The recipe offers the option of adding wine and lemon. I did this and found it really improved overall taste. Here is the ingredients I used which turned out excellently: 5 slices bacon 1 lrg onion carrots 1/2 cup water chkn broth sea salt pepper 1 cup kale 4 red potatos sliced 1 cup butter 1 cup flour 1 pint half-n-half 3/4 wine 1/4 lemon 1 pound left-over salmon Really was an excellent chowder.

Thinking that had to be a mistake and fearing ruining the recipe I used only about one teaspoon and after the taste test didn't feel the need to add more. To cut the fat instead of 1 cup of butter I used 1/2 cup of Earth Balance (vegetable oil product that tastes remarkably like butter) to create the roux. If you do this the roux will be too thick to pour and you ll need a BIG skillet and will need to gradually add a lot of the milk until it s a consistency that you can add to the soup. Instead of milk I used half 2% milk and half 1/2&1/2. I did use the (optional) white wine. That s an absolute must! Note-the recipe says it makes six servings. It was more like a dozen servings!",

I cooked the bacon onion & celery in a pan as directed then added it to my slow cooker with the water chix stock that I subbed for fish stock and spices. Once that mix had a chance to heat up I added the roux gave it an hour or so to thicken then threw in the remaining ingredients of Salmon corn etc. I like my chowder w/ a wee little kick so I also added a little cayanne pepper & paprika. The finished recipe made a ton of chowder... more like 10 - 12 servings and was a huge hit with my husband & bro-in-law.",
