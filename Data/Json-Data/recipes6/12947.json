I read other reviews that it was a \"skimpy\" recipe, so I doubled it and made it with THREE eggs, added slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon of salt and used salted butter.  The oatmeal I used was \"Quick\" and I also added one cup of dried cranberries to the doubled recipe.  You could also use 1 cup chopped dried cherries instead.  I used a medium size ice cream scoop to transfer the dough to the cookie sheet (I use a Silpat mat instead of a greased cookie sheet).  The cookie baked perfectly at exactly 12 minutes...It was wonderfully soft in the middle and just slightly crispy on the outside edges.  It had nice height to it, didn't spread out much and was a huge hit with everyone who tried it!",

The dough always seems a little dry, but just press it all together, throw them on the sheet, and they come out just terrific.

I have also halved the dough after adding the nuts but before the chocolate, and made half with white choc, and half with semi sweet.",

I reduced sugar to 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.And remember to chop macadamia nut into quarters if not you will have a hard time shaping your cookies.the dough is kinda dry so you have to shape them using ypur hands n pressing them slightly or your cookie will be like a ball. I like this recipe 'cos it is not too sweet n it uses really little butter healthier choice",
