I used a tomato straight from the garden that was so flavorful and juicy it tasted like a little bit of summer sunshine. Using the avocado was a nice alternative and a welcome change to a traditional Caprese salad. The only difference is I used a balsamic vinegar that I had reduced down to a syrup consistency. Very nice change of pace devilsdancefloor. Thank you for the submission.",

This is fabulous we had a platter of this as an appetizer yesterday and I'm making more today. I had to use small Campari tomatoes because large tomatoes around here this time of year are not very good. I recommend not adding basil to this because its going to kill the flavor of the avocado. I did see some members did this after reading reviews I would not like this with basil added also. Be sure to use the salt and pepper too this recipe is perfect as is! I can't wait to make this with summer tomatoes thanks for sharing this. I will make this often:)",

Its delicate flavor was overwhelmed by the stronger tastes of the vinegar tomato and mozzarella. Also if you're going to make this you really can't skimp...you have to use high quality ingredients. As a result this is a surprisingly expensive dish. This is very filling. My husband and I had it for dinner and it was more than enough to fill us. This would probably be fine to make 6 appetizers (one \"stack\" per person). Thanks for the recipe!",
