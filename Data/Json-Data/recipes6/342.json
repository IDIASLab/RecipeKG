Looked absolutely gourmet and was cooked to perfection. I followed the recipe closely (just added fresh pineapple verses canned) and it wasn't too spicy with a touch of sweetness.. \"tastes like it came out of a restaurant\" was my husbands comment and he wanted more when we were finished! Thank you for this fantastic recipe!",

My bf and I made this with frozen vaccuum sealed Mahi and I didn't think it was going to be that great but even with the frozen fish it was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was wonderful. I don't have a big sweet tooth and thought the brown sugar was going to be a little much but it just carmelizes the onions and has a subtle hint of sweetness. Great with brown rice and a salad. We will definitely be making this again.",
