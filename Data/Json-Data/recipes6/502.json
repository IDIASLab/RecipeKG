But made a couple embellishments which worked wonderfully: - added a large ripe peach to the filling. - used the juice of one grapefruit instead of lemon juice and let it sit overnight with the fruit pouring off (and drinking) the excess when I made it this evening. - added a couple tablespoons of steel-cut oats and a dash of allspice to the topping. - I also used a hard red-wheat bread flour rather than all-purpose (which i rarely use anymore) which really made the topping heartier. Wonderful. Just wonderful.",

Instead of buttering the dish I put a T of butter in the dish & let it melt in the oven. Swirled it around & continued. I used 3T not 4 unsalted butter in the topping. 'Cheese flavor isn't very noticeable but it can be seen a bit. I partially peeled the pears. Something left an odd feel. I couldn't tell if it was the peel or the cheese. I'd try mild vs sharp since it's easier to melt & not get too firm. Good but I don't think I'll make again; but if I do I'm peeling completely.",
