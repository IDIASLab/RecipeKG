Marinated for more like 6 hours and then poured most of the marinade into the pan with the chicken. Without any flour or cornstarch the sauce thickened up a bit and I served over rice. Other than planning this early (because of the marinating time) it's probably the easiest recipe I've tried. It had great flavour and we will definitely be adding this to the regular rotation. Might add some chopped peppers in with the onions next time for some color.",
