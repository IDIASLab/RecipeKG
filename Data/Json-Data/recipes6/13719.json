We have a cook-out coming up in a few weeks and everyone at work is begging for me to bring this again.  It is a huge hit!  One thing I did find the second time I made it is that if you beat the eggs, half-and-half and cream first until fluffy, then slowly add the other ingredients one at a time - corn last, the consistency is much lighter and fluffier!  GREAT recipe - will make it again and again!",

I also used a water bath for even cooking in the oven. Give it some time for cooling before serving so your servings will hold shape better. Definitely worth the wait!!",
