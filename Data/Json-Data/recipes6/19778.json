Man after I mixed this up I had one bite. And had I not put the lid on the container and slapped it in the refrigerator I'd have eaten the whole thing. It's hard to imagine that this will taste better than it already does but we are having it with Honey Ribs tonight--another recipe from the allrecipes website. I have tried many many slaw recipes from this website most of them very good to great. This one is right up there with the best of them. I highly recommend it.",
