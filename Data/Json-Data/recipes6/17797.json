My hubby loves raspberry and almond flavor so I knew this was a good choice. I used my 1.5 Tbsp. cookie scoop to measure out the balls and came out with 27 cookies. For the glaze I did have to add an extra 1 1/2 tsp. milk to get to drizzling consistency. I put the glaze in a baggie snipped off the corner and squeezed it on in a zig-zag. I was a little disappointed in the cookie part it was hard and dry. However I do love the flavor combination and the fact that they are very pretty. Great for Valentine's Day!",
