Thankfully, I have not managed to overcook them yet.\r\n\r\nFor best results, let the glaze (lime juice and sugar) harden a little before storing the cookies. They stick together less, and the glaze is able to form a thin shell on top. One trick to apply the glaze is to dip the cookie into the glaze instead of dripping the glaze on the cookies.",
