I had all of the ingredients but if you were going to go out and buy all of this it would cost a lot of money. With that being said, this is  very good. My intentions were to buy Kansas City Strip but with the pandemic, the supply is very limited at my little grocery store. I ended up with a very cheap cut but hindsight it was the perfect choice. There is a lot of flavor going on and this recipe turned a tough cut into a very tender steak. I don't think you'd want to put this on an expensive cut of steak that is naturally tender because the flavor of the marinade would overpower .  I will most definitely make this again.",

I scaled this back to 5 servings and it was the perfect amount for 4 thin ribeyes.  I grilled these up on the range top on a cast iron grill pan.  I was told to make this again and again.",
