First, I added an extra yolk in the custard mix, only because I wanted to \"paint\" the unbaked crust with egg white before I filled it, as another reviewer had suggested, (but then I forgot to do that).  I also substituted one-quarter tsp of almond with for equal amount of the vanilla, to subtly enhance the coconut flavor.  Because I had it in the fridge already, I used a quarter-cup of heavy cream in the milk.  Oh ... I also did not use the broiled topping ... just didn't think it needed it ... but I think the next time I will sprinkle the filled crust with a healthy dose of coconut before sliding the pie into the oven.  My custard nicely filled a deep-dish pan and needed about ten extra minutes of baking time to come out perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe!",

We used 4 Jumbo Eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extracts. Used 2 cups milk/cream (1 cup coconut milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream & 1/2 cup 2% milk) instead of 2 1/2 cups total. Also used a little over 1 cup of coconut in the custard and left the topping at 1/2 cup and baked in a deep dish pie pan. It did take approx 40 min to bake and had to cover the crust after 25 minutes to prevent burning. Excellent and everyone really enjoyed it. Will make this one every Easter! Thanks for sharing.",
