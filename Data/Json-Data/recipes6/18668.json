The only things I did differently was use a 13x9x2\" pan, omit the whole cloves, and I cut mine in squares.    The 1st time I made it (not knowing any better) I ran out of butter before putting on the last top 8 layers. So I had to melt an additional stick of butter. Yeah it was so buttery that when you cut it with a fork buttery goodness would seep out. Everyone LOVED IT. They had seconds and took some with them for the road trip back home.    I had left over nuts and left over syrup from the 1st batch - so I made it again (last night): This time I had left over butter as the recipe indicated I would: \"Heat the remaining melted butter until boiling, and drizzle it evenly over the whole pan\". I only poured half of what I had left over. This time around I dusted the top with left over nut/sugar mix.     The cooking time 1:15 was too much and it made the top layer a bit brown instead of golden. Didn't taste any different. I would check it after an hour, if it risen and golden, pull it.   I would not use whole cloves to garnish (useless unless edible. Use extra pistachios). T    This was excellent, and very impressive to make for others. It doesn't take that long to make and it's not hard to make either. The layering takes a bit and I'm a bit forgetful so keeping count of layers was the only frustrating part.",
