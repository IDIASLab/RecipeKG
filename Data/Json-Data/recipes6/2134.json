Frosted w/ chocolate frosting, but want to try a cream cheese frosting next time. Really good flavor, maybe a touch dry, but I may have over-baked them by a minute or 2 (baked them for 20 mins.)...should've checked them sooner. All in all, I would make these again, as the family liked them! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I added chopped walnuts and had 3 bananas so added them all didn't find the banana overpowering in fact only had a slight banana flavour I grated bakers chocolate on top while warm just prior to serving. For those of you not watching cholesterol.....butter is nice while warm as well...mmmm.",
