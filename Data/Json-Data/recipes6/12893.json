I live at a high altitude so i used a little less flour and added one more egg and baked them for a bit longer and they turned out beautifully. I used a Calphalon cookie sheet liner and the cookies lifted easily. My husband came home and ate 8 before dinner! This recipe is an absolute keeper! My only suggestion is to make sure to spoon out a small amount onto your cookie sheet because they really expand I did only 8 at a time but they turned out perfectly!",

Guests who were over while we were baking them attributed to their disapearance. Still very good and will pass on the recipe.",

The best we've done so far is chop up those bite sized heath crunches. ALso good was adding chocolate chips a symphony bar with almonds and toffee and some of those toffee bits I found in with the chocolate chip section put out by Skor. Fabulous recipe though the cookies don't last around us!!:) I'll probably be making this every week from now on. Mmmm",
