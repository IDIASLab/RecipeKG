I kept it in the oven an extra 5 minutes with the heat off, to set the middle of the lemon filling more.  Will make again.",

The graham crust required no mental adjustment for me--this is how my mom always made them! Basically because I wanted a really tart square I added a splash extra lemon juice (regular ole bottled stuff) and did like nora and only added 2.5 cups of sugar. Added an extra tbsp or so of flour to the filling; it seemed a little watery. I also omitted the confectioner's sugar. As I say; I wanted 'em tart. Began eating them out of the pan only mostly cooled--a very good sign! In fact I was shocked hear my ultra-picky fiance making happy noises while he ate.",
