In place of raw chopped onion (kids don't like) I used 1/2 a packet of lipton dried onion mix.  I wanted to add more flavor to the gravy so in place of  ALL 5 cups of milk I used 2 cups evaporated milk, 1 cup low sodium  boxed beef broth, 1 cup of water and 1 cup regular milk.  Served over egg noodles and/or biscuits.  I had 2 extra kids tonight for dinner and they all wanted seconds!!!  Good thing this is one of those dishes you can continue to add liquid and flour to make more servings!!  ",

I'm from the south and I've ate hamburger gravy since I was little and have been making it for MY family for years, but never with milk ...I love milk gravy, we use that for sausage gravy, chicken fried steak, etc. but never with hamburger meat, it was delicious!  I ran out of milk so I used canned evaporated milk instead (one can milk to one can water to make whole milk, but had to use 2 cans to get the 5 cups) and it turned out wonderful, I also added about 4 tablespoons of beefy onion soup mix ( that i make myself) in place of the chicken boullion.  Such a great recipe, thank you for posting it. This is now my new hamburger gravy recipe!! :o)",

Remove mushrooms and melt 1/3 c. butter and 1/4 c. flour, cook the butter and flour for about 3 min. to remove the raw flour taste and then add the milk (warmed) to the roux and wisk it to smooth out the gravy. Add rest of the ingredients. Fresh garlic diced is a good addition also.  I've been cooking for 53 years now...",
