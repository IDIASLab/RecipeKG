I did not put in half of the batter first I spay coated the pan and put all of the batter in. Then I generously shook the cinnamon and sugar mixture over the top. I also took a knife and made swirly movements till it was all the way through the batter then I shook more cinnamon sugar on top. This was liked by all the boys as well as Hubby and I. I will definitely make this again. Thanks Terri for the good recipe.",

Well our home smelled so good while it was baking that we decided to eat some for dessert. It was still warm and light with a light flavor and crusty top. Delicious! This morning I found a note from hubby that it was wonderful in his milk for breakfast too! I took someone else's advice and folded in the dry ingredients and sour cream instead of beating them in to avoid a tough batter. I used brown sugar for the filling/topping and also flecks of butter. The cake rose very well and was very moist. I refrigerated it overnight and this morning it seemed heavier and denser. It was sweet but not overly so which is exactly what I like. Great recipe Terri! It's going to be a regular at my house.",

Used 1/2 for the middle layer and added toasted chopped pecans to the top along with about 1/4 stick of cold butter cut sliced and cut into quarters over the entire thing. When the butter melted and folded back into the cake there formed a very nice roll of the sugar cinnamon down into the cake surface. This was a MUCH prettier and tasty presentation. Thanks Terri for a classic coffee cake!",
