Tip for the previous reviewer who found them messy to roll out:  I rolled about half of the dough between 2 large sheets of wax paper.  (Put the rest of the dough in the fridge until you're ready for it.)  The wax paper keeps the dough from sticking to your rolling pin and work surface - you don't even need to use any flour.  Peel off the top sheet and do your cut-outs.  The cookies will also be easy to lift off from the bottom sheet.  Also, you can keep re-rolling the scraps of dough without having to worry that you've added too much flour to the recipe.",

I used a very small round cookie cutter to make a very delicate sized cookie. I only put one very tiny piece of marschino cherry in the centre. Tht is how I remember them from the bakery. I added a few tablespoons of wheat germ to add texture to the dough. I put the jam on the one half of the cookie then left that jam covered half open on racks for awhile so the jam could \"dry out a bit\" then I closed it up with the top cookie.and iced it. Yes a bit of work but worth it.",

I put the cookies on a parchment lined cookie tray and chilled them in the fridge for 10 mins before baking them. My cookies only took 8 mins to bake and for the edges to turn a very light golden colour. Next time I think I might add a little more vanilla to enhance the flavor of the cookies.
