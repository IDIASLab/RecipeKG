I do however believe that an entire cup of salad dressing would be too much for 6 servings but i only made enough for myself and adjusted the amount i made to taste. I used a yellow Bartlett pear because that's what i had on hand but would be tasty with any pear.I also omitted the pecans and added extra almonds. I used shredded Havarti cheese with some cubes of sharp cheddar and added some slivers of red onion because i love the contrast of that onion flavor with the sweetness of the cranberries. Its a great change from the typical salad and reminds me of one you would order in a restaurant! Next time i will add a bit of Dijon mustard to the dressing.",

I usually make these few changes to adjust to our tastes. 1) Reduce oil to 1/2 cup. 2) Increase brown sugar to 2 or 3 Tablespoons. 3) Omit the onions and almonds. 4) Use candied or glazed pecans. 5) Increase the salad to 8 cups. I always make ahead several hours (usually overnight) so the flavors really mix together. I've been asked for this recipe at each meal at which I've served it.",
