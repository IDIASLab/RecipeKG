I wanted to make my wife a dish that would make her enjoy salmon for the first time, and this floored her. Meanwhile, the sake butter sauce was what really blew me away, super zesty and rich and packing a lot more flavor than I'm used to getting from a restaurant. It does take a lot of steady whisking, but if you can manage it it's worth the effort.",
