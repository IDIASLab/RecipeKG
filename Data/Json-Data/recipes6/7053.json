This vegan recipe has fiber, flavonoids, beta-carotene, and the anti-inflammatory compounds in ginger, turmeric, and cayenne, along with omega-3 in the walnuts, and vitamin C in the lemon juice. All this, plus kale, one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet! I promise, though, with all the great flavors in the pesto, you will barely know it's kale. Store any extra pesto in the refrigerator, sealed, for up to 1 week.",
