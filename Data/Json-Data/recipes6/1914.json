They stuck to the wrappers, but maybe tomorrow they'll be easier.  Funny that allbran has sugar & fiber one doesn't.  I used allbran & these were sweet enough, could lessen it even.  These aren't obvious cereal-based & aren't so healthy-tasting that they'll go uneaten (I hope)!  Oh, I didn't have sr flour - subbed w 1 1/2t powder & 1/2t salt.  These didn't knock my socks off, but I am glad I made 'em.  Wrappers came off easier later in the day.  'Might need fruit to be a five star  muff.  :)  Oh, these have dried crans.  Maybe more, fresh, or a different fruit would do the trick.",
