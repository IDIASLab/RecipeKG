The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you to do this, but if you\u2019re baking in a glass dish, I\u2019d recommend allowing it to cool a little bit before putting it into the fridge.  I was a little concerned the glass might break going directly from the hot oven to the cold refrigerator.  These are chewy, but in a good way.  Super easy to make, and they were good.",
