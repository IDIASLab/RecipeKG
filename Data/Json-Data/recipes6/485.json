Just as any drink served in a martini glass seems to be called a martini nowadays, it also seems any cake recipe baked in a cupcake liner and left unfrosted is called a muffin.  Not.  The mixing method is different, the flour to fat ratio is different, and a muffin has very little sugar (as opposed to cakes, where the flour and sugar ratio is nearly equal).   This is a muffin, and I appreciated that.  I added two cups of chopped rhubarb, not because this basic muffin needed it, but because I'm looking for excuses to use it.  I also sprinkled them with some demerera (turbinado) sugar just to dress them up.  These are moist, rather \"bland,\" as true muffins are supposed to be (do we think of biscuits as bland?), the taste of the oatmeal apparent.  Just the right level of sweetness - remember, this is a muffin, not cake!  When I mixed up the batter I did use a heaping cup of sugar but only to adjust for the tartness of the rhubarb.  While these would be delicious spread with a little butter, honey or jam, they were quite satisfying just as is.",

They are light fluffy wholesome oaty muffins with a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar that go well with foods you would normally serve with cornbread (chili stew roasts). I however love a muffin that isn't loaded with sugar or filled with fruit and found these to be delicious warm with just a pat of butter. I use regular rolled oats and sub 1 c. of white whole wheat flour for regular flour and use melted coconut oil instead of butter I even leave out the cinnamon and salt. Wonderful!",
