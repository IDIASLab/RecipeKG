Because of some of the other reviews I used 3/4 C of Sugar and also added 1/4 of Brown Sugar. The muffins were sweet but we love them that way. Also I had no applesauce and was about 1/4 cup short on Sour Cream so I used a whole cup of Peach Yogurt to substitute the additional 1/4 cup os SC and the applesauce. It didn't make the muffins taste at all peachy. After mixing I thought the mix was a bit thick so I added about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the juice from the bowl my mulberrys were in. I think this added alot of extra flaroful. I also added 1tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Because with all of these revisions the muffins were super moist a bit on the dense side and had a great Mulberry flavor. I made 24 muffins at 2pm and the next day we only had 3 left. The family loved them.",

Well more for me.:-) I substituted the sour cream and skim milk with additional whole milk and apple sauce. I made one batch with a white sugar/butter/flour crumb topping and split the recipe sugar using 1/2 white sugar 1/2 dark brown sugar. Very tasty either way as the original recipe or with just about any alterations you care to make to your liking. Simple to make fun to eat. The only problem I had was that the muffins stuck to the paper cups but I don't think that had anything to do with the recipe.",
