I would make this again even if it were hard to do, but luckily it's super easy. Unlike actual chicken Parmesan where that crispy breading gets soggy super fast, this goes over crunchy toast so the textural experience is probably even better. Serve hot, warm, or room temperature, with lots of crispy crostini.",

We didn't just use crostini for ours; because my family ate this as a meal, we used sandwich rolls, and it was DELICIOUS.\n\nInstead of cooking our own chicken, I got some chilled rotisserie chicken breasts from the store. Since we didn't have pan drippings from fresh-cooked chicken, I didn't drain the ricotta, and it worked very well. I think I used too much chicken, though, so I ended up having to add another 1/2 cup of sauce.\n\nPlease make this. You won't be disappointed.",
