They were a light brown beyond flat rock hard and with trying every way possible to bake them including changing cookie sheets to refrigerating the dough before baking them they still did not turn out and absolutely nothing seemed to work!!! I made these cookies not once but twice because I figured that I had forgotten something in the first batch but not only did I use new baking soda (? why they are so flat) but also payed close attention to the recipe and did everything right the second time (I think) with no satisfaction. The dough was great and tasty but only before baking.",
