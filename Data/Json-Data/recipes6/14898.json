I added the optional nut (chopped pecans). This tasted like a mix of an oatmeal cookies a chocolate chip cookie and a blonde brownie. It is both soft and chewy like a cake cookie and a brownie. It tastes good but I think the name is a little misleading in taste and texture. It did bake up nicely. However I think I will be sharing this with some kids down the street. As this is a little too many sweets mixed together for me with the 2 cups of sugar and full 12oz bag of chocolate chips it took to make it. I am sure though those kids will enjoy it.",
