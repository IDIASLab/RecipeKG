It's one of my most popular cheesecakes--and I make lots of them!  I garnish with drizzles of chocolate ganache.  It's important to add a bit more than just one package of the gelatin--I dissolve about 1 1/3 pkg. of gelatin in the 1/2 C. of cold water.    I also make my crust with 15 graham crackers, 1/4 cup of sugar, mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter.  I bake the crust at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, then allow it to cool before putting the Amaretto Mousse in.  Soooo light and yummy!",

Not sure how it would have been with just the 1 package, but I can say that the firmness was spot on using the 1-1/3 pkgs. One of my friends said it was the best cheesecake she has ever eaten!",

Because I was going to cover them in a chocolate mirror glaze, I added a little sugar to the crust and baked it for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven to set the crust.   I froze the individual cheesecakes overnight so they would be frozen solid before pouring the chocolate mirror glaze over them.  I baked a few almonds to release the oils and then chopped them very finely to decorate the bottom edge of each cheesecake.  They came out just as I had hoped.",
