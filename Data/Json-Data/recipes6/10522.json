I warmed up the milk, water and butter in the pan  and then added it to a bowl with the yeast where i let it stand for 10 minutes. I then added the flour, eggs and salt  all at the same time, unlike other reviewers I didn't think there was too much liquid, I was able to turn the dough out and kneed with maybe 1/4 cup of flour just to keep my hands coated. i left in a cold oven over night and baked the next day for 18 minutes, they were wonderful and I have made them many times since, great each time.

I wanted to clarify: warm milk, water & butter (I use the microwave), add egg(s), flour, yeast, sugar & salt to machine.  Brush melted butter over dough, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, raisins/nuts (optional). I cut the rolls with dental floss (wrap floss around roll, tie pulling floss so it slices the dough as you make a knot).  Now, I only bake them for 18-20 minutes. I've never measured milk for the frosting, I just add a little at a time until it's a nice spreading consistency. UPDATE I use brown sugar for the filling now because we prefer them gooey.",

I don t always have the best luck with yeast so this is the trick I ve learned in a measuring cup I heated cup of the water and stirred in 2 Tbs. yeast and tsp of sugar. I covered it with a small plate to allow it to foam. When it s foamed up about 2 inches or more I use it but it will continue to foam if you leave it and should only take about 5 minutes to begin foaming. While the yeast was sitting I heated the butter milk and only cup of the water (minus the cup for the yeast). I don t have a bread machine so I did it the old fashioned way by hand! I mixed together the dry ingredients (flour sugar & salt) and then added the butter mixture yeast (foam and all) and eggs. I mixed it well and had to add quite a bit of extra flour while kneading. I greased a bowl covered it and put it in a warm place to rise. After about an hour it was ready for step #2 in the recipe. Hope this helps with the yeast problems. I added extra cinnamon-sugar and sprinkled extra cinnamon on. Yum! The extra cinnamon was perfect for us; not too sweet but sweet enough. The rolls were light and so soft. This recipe wasn t too difficult and gave me delicious results. Thanks for the post Stephanie!",
