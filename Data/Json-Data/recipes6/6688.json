I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil white vinegar for the sherry added some garlic powder and increased the portions of soy sauce ginger and garlic. I let the steaks marinade in the refrigerator in a covered glass dish for a little over four hours turning three times. We only made three swordfish steaks since that is the current size of our family (with one on the way) and grilled as stated in the directions. I reserved the marinade and put it in a small skillet while my husband grilled the fish. After letting the marinade settle I removed some of the olive oil with a spoon and replaced it with spicy sesame oil. I cooked the marinade for a few minutes before pouring it in a glass measuring cup. When the steaks were done I whisked the remaining marinade into a creamy texture and poured on our fish. We could have taken the fish off of the grill a few minutes earlier (it absolutely did not need the full 8 minutes per side on a gas grill) but the addition of the spicy sauce on top saved it completely! I will definitely be making this again. Super easy and absolutely delicious.",

Regardless I liked the marinade so much that I put some aside and saut\u00e9ed sliced mushrooms with it. I'm sure this would be great with tuna steaks too... We served this with a side of asparagus wrapped in proscuitto (drizzled with a little olive oil and basalmic vinegar). Wonderful!",
