I'd doubled the recipe and everyone truly enjoyed it. Three have asked for the recipe and I've been asked to bake another for a birthday just three days after I'd baked the first one!!",

What kind of beer you use makes a difference here (guiness is prob the best choice) - I used a belgian-style white beer because it was what i had on hand and it ended up with a lingering alcohol taste (not in a good way). So instead of fighting it I went with it! Just before icing I brushed on about 1/4c of SoCo and a bit of homemade apricot liqueur. It was DELICIOUS! I'm sure any liquer would work... Grand Marnier perhaps? Substituted a Cream cheese icing also - Cream together 1 pkg Neufchatel or Cream Cheese & 1/2 stick butter then mix in 1 to 1.5 cups confectioner's sugar (depending on your sweet tooth) and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. This was a big birthday hit:-)",
