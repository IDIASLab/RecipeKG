I should have tossed the peaches with either flour or cornstarch before I placed them in the pan. As written the topping seemed rather bland so I added cinnamon for some extra flavor. Next time I'll leave out the egg and make more of a crumb topping and also use brown sugar along with the white. With a few adjustments this recipe has a lot of potential.",
