Like many i had my doubts i mean vinger? well this is definitely better than the previous high fat high calorie batch of cakes i made. ITs super moist and chocolatey. Here is a tip: I replaced water with chocolate soy milk was very generous with the baking soda and powder( i put heaped teaspoons) and put in about 6 teaspoons of vanilla essence put in about 8 HEAPED TABLESPOONS of coco powder ( i used hershey's) and used olive oil. PLUS i also added abit more sugar maybe a 1/4 cup more? I also added the salt as recommanded by another reviewer. I made them into cupcakes and it rose beautifully. Also don't forget to sift the flours together. It tasted great before icing and after icing(got it off the back of hershey's tin used olive oil and chocolate soy milk again as replacements)them i stuck them in the fridge and it was fanstastic! my friends are impressed and they can't believe its low fat! I will definitely make this more often. Am thinking of adding hazelnuts the next time. Thanks for this recipie! Means alot to a recently diagnosed lactose intolerant chocoholic!",

I let them cool in the tins and they were so moist. I had to let them cook for longer then the recipe said though. I iced them with the icing off the anaphalaxis website like someone else suggested.

I do have a couple of suggestions though the cake needs to bake for about 45 minutes and after it cools add the powdered sugar but here's the winner add apple pie filling to the plate when serving (as a side) if you put it on the cake like a topping it won't keep and the cake gets mushy but if you add it to the side when serving it adds the right bit of moisture and sweetness! Thanks to this recipe my food allergic daughter was able to enjoy cake on her birthday like any other kid. Another note don't put it on your dining room table to cool dogs like it too.;o)",
