After 20 years of making rum cakes, please follow my advice:  MUST USE DARK RUM!  White rum just won't cut it.  Also, instead of buttermilk, use half milk & half rum & no nasty rum flavoring.  Can add pecans in the bottom of the pan.  For the glaze, 1 stick of butter is greatly sufficient.  If you want more glaze, add more sugar & rum with additional butter so it won't be so greasy.  I prefer to boil the glaze until it gets thick before pouring over cake.",

I susbtitute 2% milk sometime for the buttermilk. Add pecans and Marchino cherries to the bottom of the pan to make it look festive. I have also used Brown sugar, butter and pecans to make a crumble. No matter what I use it's always a hit. To me it's better the longer it ages. I make it a day or two before serving. I have sent it down range to many friends that have deployed and it is always a hit down range. It travels so well and stays fresh! For them I don't use any alcohol but use about 2t of extract for the glaze(almond, rum, coconut and rum). A definite on my holiday dessert table EVERY year!",

I sifted my dry ingredients twice.\nI also made sure that the butter and sugar was nice and fluffy. When making the cake you must take you time. The other trick is to poke enough holes in it so the glaze goes through it. Remember this is a homemade cake, not a box mix. Thanks for a great recipe!\n",
