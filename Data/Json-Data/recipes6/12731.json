Instead of making the \"chocolate cake mix\" I actually had a Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Devils food cake mix that I had to use up so I used that but cut the water down to 1 Cup rather than the 1 1/3 it calls for. Mixture was thick enough to make really nice tablespoon \"plops\". Thank you Stef for such a quick and fun recipe! Just need to add a bit of info --- I made these for our Church potluck farewall luncheon for our Athletes in Action Baseball team. They were a HUGE hit!!!!",

After reading the reviews, and noting that several people had mentioned the dryness of the cakes and the sweetness of the icing, I tried the following:  1 cup of powdered sugar instead of 1 3/4 cooking the cakes the minimum time listed  The cakes were moist and delicious. The icing was peanut buttery goodness and not too sweet Yummmm!!!",

I didn't have an issue w/ dryness. I changed the second batch before it went it and this seemed to help, so this is what I would suggest: add 1 tsp. baking powder as well to the batter, add about 1/4 c. extra cocoa powder for a more chocolately taste and bake for only 6 minutes. Measure with a larger spoon, too. Hope this helps some of you!",
