It came out GREAT. I changed a lot of the recipe - I added about 3/4 cup of cocoa powder w/the dry ingredients omitted the raisins/cloves used about a half cup extra of applesauce and about a tablespoon of vegetable oil and baked it in a small round springform pan. I topped it with a simple glaze (ref: vanilla glaze recipe on this site) and then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar. It came out fantastic this is a great recipe to get creative with - Thanks for posting!",

The flavor is still excellent but I have a very dense cake. It is recommended that for cakes to use an 8\" pan instead of 9\" and add 1/2 c. non-fat dry milk and 1/2 tsp. soda for every cup of Spenda. Wish I would have checked into this before! Also I left out the raisins would be better with walnuts I think.",
