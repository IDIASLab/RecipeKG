I tried this on pork chops and chicken (both BBQ'd of course) and they were divine.\n\nAs suggested, I added three tablespoons of cornstarch to prevent clumping (for storage).  It worked like a CHARM.  The cornstarch also reduces a lot of the heat, if you shy away from spices.\n\nI agree with Voleyballmom: this will not taste good on beef.  Sorry, chickens!",
