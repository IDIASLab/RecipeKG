This recipe was very easy to make in steps. I was able to whip this up while I also cooking dinner caring for our demanding toddler etc. Made crust first put in the fridge. Then the next time I had a breather I whipped up the filling. Filling sat for a bit before I could put it all together and throw in the oven. I made a mistake on the crust and melted 8 tbsp (a whole cube) of butter instead of 6. I had already added the crushed wafers to the butter so I just crushed up and added more wafers until the consistency was right. I ended up using a total of 53 wafers. It turned out very well. I used small-curd cottage cheese and it blended smooth easily. I substituted orange juice for the brandy. I also used frozen blackberries which I would not recommend. It was a lot of extra work to get them dry enough to use. Plus they were sour and not as big and juicy and sweet as the fresh ones I could have picked on our hill (I should have sent the kids out to pick them!). I used the 8\" springform pan - but next time I would use the 9\" because the cake did not get as done as I wanted it to in the center. I baked it at 375 deg. for 57 minutes! I'm pleased to say that this cheesecake was awarded the second place prize in the contest! Enjoy!",

It is my standby when bringing a dessert to a gathering and is so popular with family and friends that it is requested often. The texture is amazingly silky and light! The flavor is lovely whether I use cherry brandy or kirsh. My favorite fruit choices for this are sour cherries or blackberries and I often put a sour cream and sugar layer over the top just before the fruit topping which tastes as great as it looks. I sometimes make it with a graham cracker crust just for variety. Fabulous!",
