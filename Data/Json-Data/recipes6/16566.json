I actually made the pudding first and used 1 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cup milk and it make it thick and rich more like a thin custard. It also made the pie hold up much better. I let the pudding set up in the fridge while I made the rest of the pie. I piped on the rest of the whipped cream and placed strawberries on for decoration. It was beautiful, and tasted wonderful!",

Here are the changes we made: We used the premade graham cracker crust, added 1 1/2 cups heavy cream & 2 cups whole milk to the pudding and chilled. We made fresh homemade whipping cream in place of the whipped topping.  We did not add the sugar to the cream cheese mixture because we sweetened the whipping cream.  We also added fresh Raspberries intead of Strawberries and decorated it with both Blueberries and Raspberries for the Holiday.  Easy to make!",

People are always asking me to bake it for them. I use 2 1/2 cups of graham crackers instead of 1 1/2. I you want the graham crackers to be soft and melt in your mouth lather them butter and push all the graham crackers together (My preference). If you like a crunchy harder texture for graham cracker put less butter then more and crack them in big nickel sized chunks (parents preference). I Used banana pudding and it made it so extremely good. Low fat cream cheese is not to bad either. Its A MUST TRY!!",
