I just spread the seasoning all over and added a little liquid smoke, 275 degree oven for 6 hrs and the meat was fork tender! About half way through, I poured off most of the broth. When it was done, I added some of the broth back in along with just a touch of bbq sauce, I didn't want to drown it. The slaw on top sends this sammie over the TOP! Thank you Lori, WINNER WINNER OINKY DINNER!!",

My husband kept saying to me \"now don't dry it out\".  So after I shredded the pork I put it in the fridge overnight in the orginial juices.  The yummy juices absorbed back into the pork...keeping it moist.   I just rewarmed it (in the crock-pot) the next day & put a little BBQ sauce on it.  Couldn't have been easier.

I lots of other leftovers but no pork and I made 2 batches. The only difference I made was that I used a Hellmans Mayo Dijon mix. They make and sell it already mixed. It was delicious. My crew isn't overly fond of the stronger taste of the Dijon mustard alone. This recipe was fantastic!! And my house smelled so dang good. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.",
