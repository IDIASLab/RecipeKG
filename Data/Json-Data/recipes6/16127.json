I was intrigued by the lemon juice and wondered if it might contribute a sort of buttermilk or even sourdough tang but it doesn't. I wondered why the submitter chose to use both olive oil AND margarine and milk AND water rather than one or the other. And why only a half cup of whole wheat flour when most recipes of this type would call for a cup. Whatever her reasons for her \"little bit of this and a little bit of that \" her recipe turns out a really nice loaf of bread - just a little wheaty (which appeals to me) soft but with a chewy crust (I used the medium crust setting) and just an all around good everyday bread for toast sandwiches or the dinner table. While I did stick to the ingredients list strictly (except for the butter switch) I did not heat the milk and water as the recipe directed. Rather I stuck to the manufacturer's directions for my bread maker. This is the kind of recipe you'd return to over and over again when you just want a good reliable basic bread. Very glad I tried it!",

I allowed it to rise twice before shaping into a loaf a final rise and then baking at 350 for 30 minutes. While it had a lovely texture and perfect crust it still just tasted like white bread.

At the final rise I pulled it out to get the paddle out and realized it was way to wet, but too late to add any flour. I was correct, it resulted in a sunken loaf. Taste was decent, though, so I tried again thinking I might have mis-measured, trying to cook with small kids underfoot. Alas, I was very careful the second time around and it also was too wet. This time I had checked early enough and added 1/4 cup of AP flour.  It just got to the final rise stage, and again, it was all stuck to my hands. Too wet. The taste of this is fine, but I won't give it another go trying to get a loaf I can make sandwiches with",
