                "reviewBody": "This is delicious! I used more than 3/4 lb leftover turkey (incidently this is great for chicken too). I coarsely chopped the turkey. I hand chopped the celery, fine, I finely minced red onion(no green on hand). To my mayo I added a small amount of spicy brown mustard, a dash or two of liquid smoke because GilDavid is right the smoke taste sings! The only thing added that was processed in the food processor was a tiny bit of my sofrito. (This way you can sneak in bell pepper and onion etc. on those that do not care for it)! Sofrito can be used any any dish or food where you would use bell peppers. I used Mrs. Dash in place of salt, no sweetner, just a dash of rice vinegar. If you want to play with sofrito...you place in your food processor  I good sized onion cut in medium pieces. 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper , five med to large cloves of garlic smashed well, 1 big bunch of cilantro. I chop the stems of the cilantro into about 1\" pieces or they'll wrap around the chopper. I also add the items one food at a time to make sure that they all get processed fine. Do not have water on any of your foods as it will make it too runny. Place in large jar in fridge and use in cooking according to taste. It makes almost a quart. I go through a batch a month minimum. Don't taste it alone, it's very strong & bitter but in food it's great! I do not wash the cilantro ahead of time, they spray it every few min. at the grocery store. Try it you'll like it!",

I will make it again and again. I made it pretty much the same but I didn't use red peppers and I didn't blend mine. I like it a little chunky. I also added about a tbsp. mor of the mustard and also added about a tsp. of cayenne pepper and some louisiana roasted garlic hot sauce for some kick! You have to try this recipe it is very tasty!
