                "reviewBody": "After trying this recipe the suggested way I sought to improve the texture (due to it's runny feel). I used the same measurements for the custard (actually I used 6 teaspoons of vanilla extract per suggested vanilla bean). And instead of waiting for the cream and vanilla to cool for 30 minutes I VERY SLOWLY poured the mixture into the egg and sugar (If you pour to quickly the eggs will scramble) stirred well and poured the mixture into the ramekins. Then I placed the ramekins in a baking pan and added hot water to the pan until half way up the sides of the ramekins baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes (or until the custard jiggled like jello). I took the ramekins out of the water bath and cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then I put the ramekins in the fridge to cool until we were ready for dessert. When ready I broiled them for about 1 and a half minutes with brown sugar on top; and served it with strawberries and decaf coffee. This is a combination of recipes and good ideas that I have pulled from books and the internet. I still like to use this recipe (Creme Brulee IV) for customizing the custard measurements. It is a good basis for building a great brulee. I took what I liked from all of the recipes I found and left out the unnecessary difficult and expensive steps. What I was left with was a delicious simple and elegant dessert.",

Spent over 6 hours at 3 attmepts to make this work properly and found out that there is just not enough instructions in this recipe to make it work properly. Found a better recipe in which you bake the creme brulee in an oven which worked better. But best solution was going to Trader Joe's and purchasing their frozen item. That was a lot easier and didn't taset all that bad either.",
