I used whole milk instead of non-dairy creamer because non-dairy creamer just freaks me out...I wonder if it's really a food or something concocted in a lab somewhere. I also swapped brown sugar for the white sugar. Other than that the recipe remained the same and I and my other dinner party guests loved this recipe. Thanks for submitting it!",
