                "reviewBody": "I had never made crepes before, but thought, \"how hard could it be?\"  Well, it does take a little practice.  The first few attempts were \"practice crepes\"!  You need the right sized pan, and it should be nonstick, for ease of turning.  A tiny bit of Pam sprayed on the pan ensures that they don't stick, and worked better for me than oil or butter.  I kept trying to turn the crepe to soon, and it would fall apart.  Go ahead and let it cook until it looks completely cooked before you flip it, and then it only has to cook for just a bit on the other side.  I also found a fairly low heat works best - around 2 on my particular stove.  We fill these with a mixture of warm sweetened cottage cheese and cream cheese flavored with a bit of vanilla, and then top with either a fresh fruit sauce or canned fruit filling.  Cottage cheese gets very watery when warmed, so you either need to strain it before mixing with the other ingredients, or use dry curd cottage cheese.  We have also slathered Nutella on the crepe, filled with sliced bananas, and topped with slivered almonds and whipped cream.",

I have tried margarine instead of butter and that works but the taste surely suffers.  (no true buttery taste)  Definitely add vanilla extract.  These FREEZE very well and have often rescued me when I have unexpected guests.  Sounds like a lot of eggs but actually does not have an eggy taste to it.  I have also used the recipe for bacon/asparagus wraps.  Also, I have put in salt/pepper, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and portabellos to make it a crepe sandwich wrap...DELICIOUS!",
