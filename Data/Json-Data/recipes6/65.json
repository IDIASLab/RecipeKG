Just be sure that your grated carrot does not exceed 1 total cup of carrot because they will be too moist and won't cook well if you do. And I think they taste the best when made in the mini muffin pans because the edges get really brown and it adds to the taste. When they are hot out of the oven I can hardly stop popping them in my mouth. This is an excellent recipe and great not only for picky toddlers but the whole family as well!",

The butter and banana were really the only things I could taste, and even then still kind of bland. \n\nFor fun, I tried a second batch using 1/2 c. applesauce instead of butter, 1/2c. turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar, still used canned pumpkin, 2 T. flaxseed meal, and did half the batch with craisins and half without. Thought the ones without craisins were just as bland and the ones with craisins were overpowered by the craisins. \n\nSo, this recipe is not a keeper for me. I really like the morning glory muffins from this website. Some similar ingredients and I like the way they taste.",
