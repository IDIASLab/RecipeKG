I did not think it needed a full cup of olive oil for the onions so just used enough to sweat the onion tip not quite caramelized. And from past experience of cooking lentils here I have found that 20-30 minutes is sufficient. Overall this was pretty flavorful and satisfying and glad I found this!!! At the final seasoning I did add a bit of flaked red pepper for a bit of zing. Thanks for this post bolshevik",

I was running very low on my oils and have found that I can add just enough water in the pan to ensure non-stick and it browns onion & garlic nicely. For a side I made \"Moroccan Spicy Carrot Salad\" by malak. The combination of the two tastes were incredible. I loved the full flavor of the sauce and the ease of this recipe. I will definitely make it again.",
