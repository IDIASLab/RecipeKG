No cloves since I didn't have any.  Guests ate them up.  The lactating guest had four, and my children (2 and 4) loved them, raisins and all.  For some reason, I didn't trust they were done at 10 minutes (convection oven).  I left them in for 2 more, and some burned.  Refridgerated overnight, the dough looked all lumpy with sharp points, but when baked, puffed up to these completely round dome-shaped muffin top-like cookies, no matter how sloppily I dropped the dough shapes.  More of a cake texture than a drier cookie texture.  Zucchini didn't show up at all in the finished cookie, but I used a food processor for the whole thing and dumped all ingredients in rather than sifting them in.  What a time saver!  Thanks for the great recipe.",
