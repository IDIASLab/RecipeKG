I love herbs so I added about a 1/2 cup of fresh basil and 1/2 cup of parsley and used green onion instead of the red. I used about 3/4 cup of rice vinegar and about 1/4 cup of olive oil. I read some of the other reviews and tailored the recipe from there. My issue was defrosting the bags so next time I'll buy in advance and set it out on the counter for the day. I also had a hard time finding the shelled edamame but found two bags of Pict Sweet finally. This makes a LOT and it was awesome as lunch the next day! Would be good with chick peas as well and I bet fresh mint would be awesome in it!",

I love both always have a hard time deciding which one to make but I actually think the lime and cumin one is best. if you do this one here are a few tips: Thanks to other reviewers I went easy on the oil used less than 3 Tbsp and it seemed just right. It looks great especially if you add red pepper or tomato for another colour plus the tomatoes really add to the salad. I used fresh garlic instead of powder added about 1 tsp oregano and omitted parsley because I don't care for it. It is even better the next day!",
