                "reviewBody": "I mean this respectfully, but the review that has been flagged as \"most helpful\" on this recipe is so misleading. I have been making this recipe for at least six years (easily since 2004) following the instructions to the letter. I was a novice fudge maker and my first batch was perfect. Six years later, and not once has the fudge not set up or turned out. The beauty of this is that you **don't** need to worry about \"soft ball\" stages or thermometers, which can be so intimidating. Do what the recipe says. Stir constantly until it boils and start timing your 7 minutes once the fudge hits a full rolling boil, not when it just starts to bubble.  I've started the timing up to a minute late (oops) and it was still fine. I find this very forgiving. Use the timer on your stove and boil for 7 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately add marshmallow creme, incorporate and add vanilla & peanut butter as directed. No need to let cool to a magic number. I've made countless batches and it has never seized up. Pour into your 9x13 pan, let cool (don't refrigerate, I set mine in the cool garage), cut. Easy easy easy! One thing to note, using a commercial peanut butter vs an all natural gives a creamier texture. I've used name brands and cheapies and it comes out about the same. I'm a choosy mom so you can guess the brand I prefer! ;) My best advice is to keep this as the wonderful person who shared it intended. Easy!",

Depending on your stove and cookware the time could vary significantly.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you must cool it adequately before adding the peanut butter and vanilla.  It needs to cool to somewhere between 110 and 125 degrees in order to prevent the mixture from seizing.  Cooling it to this temperature could take quite a bit of time and it should not be stirred during this time.  Hopefully this helps everyone out.  The recipe is quite good and even better once you figure out the details.\r\n",

I am so impressed with this recipe I just don't have enough room to say everything I want about it.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you must try it!!  \r\nThe only thing I must caution you about is the cooking time on this recipe is off.  It says \"Total cook time: 7 minutes\". That is wrong, it takes 7 or 8 minutes just to get to the boil stage and then you must boil it for 7 more minutes, so your total cook time will be about 15 minutes.",

Two very important things to note: (1) depending on the pan size/temperature settings on your stove, boiling for 7 minutes may not get the fudge to the right temp, and if its not hot enough, it will be runny and goopy. The easiest way to guarantee that your fudge sets up correctly is to use a candy thermometer and heat it to soft ball stage (235-240 degrees). I recommend an instant-read digital thermometer - so easy to use. (2)For those who have a hard time finding marshmallow creme (or want to save some $$) 4 large marshmallows equals 1 oz of marshmallow creme, so about 30 large marshmallows should do the trick here. Best PB fudge I've had in a while, thanks for the recipe!",
