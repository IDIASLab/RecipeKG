I have my own recipe that's a winner with friends and family but I wanted to try it with whole wheat flour to see if I could tell a big difference in taste. Well I tried this cake recipe (Carrot Cake X) minus the wheat germ this past weekend (9/19/04) and I loved it. Everyone who sampled a piece enjoyed it as well. The whole wheat flour gives the cake a nice texture and it doesn't change the taste of the cake! This is definately a winner in my book!!",

He loved it and we did too. I did cheat and use the cream cheese frosting from Carrot Cake III from here. I had extra batter so I made muffins for my husbands breakfast.

ALSO I did not have Wheat Germ so I substituted All Purpose Flour in its place. For no particular reason I also added a touch of Orange Juice. Hee hee!

We substituted the sugar with just over 1 1/4 cups of honey and followed the recipe otherwise. It was DELICIOUS!
