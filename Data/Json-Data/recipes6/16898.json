I just divided the dough up into 16 balls and baked them on a cookie sheet, instead of putting them in muffin tins.  Then before I baked them, I brushed them with a beaten egg instead of butter.  Then I scored the top of them.  They had a nice, glossy crust, and were just the right size for sandwiches! I also used all white flour instead of the wheat flour.  If you use all white flour, you just have to add a little bit more flour and knead a little bit longer for the gluten to develop.  And then I divided the dough up into buns and baked them in a 9x13 for white dinner rolls.  They came out so good! Thanks so much for this great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I cut this recipe down to 12 servings. I made two small changes; I used milk instead of water and I doubled the yeast, using two envelopes fora halved recipe. (The reason I did this was because I've always had issues making whole wheat bread/rolls so I wanted to be sure this one would work.) I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm milk in my mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the beaten egg, melted butter, then all the dry ingredients. This dough needed 3/4 cup more flour to form a ball. I kneaded it with my dough hook for five minutes, then set it to rise on a warm heating pad in a greased and covered bowl for an hour. Once it doubled, I formed the rolls using a dry 1/4 inch measuring cup and set the formed rolls in a greased muffin tin. I set them to rise again on the warm heating pad, covered with saran wrap, for a half hour. 400* for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I brushed the tops with vegetable right out of the oven, as it gives them soft, bakery style tops. These rolls are absolutely delicious. I was worried that the sugar might be too much but it's really not. They're perfectly chewy but they also came out light and fluffy. Like something you'd get at a fancy bakery. VERY good. I'll use this recipe again. I think this would be really good with honey or light brown sugar in place of the granulated sugar, too.",

The dough will be much easier to stretch and will be less elastic. Especially helpful when trying to stretch pizza dough into a pan!   \n\nI have been baking bread for decades and found this recipe to be a true winner.  The rolls are pleasantly light, even delicate.  Don't be tempted to skip the second rising, that's what gives bread a fine crumb.  Great recipe Katrina, thank you so much for sharing it with us.",
