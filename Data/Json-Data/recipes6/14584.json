(The recipe I have calls for just one egg, and no salt or soda.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quality of the peanut butter makes a big difference in how these turn out. Since I make these for a friend who is a celiac, I use an old-fashion pb that is made with just ground peanuts. The cookies are much tastier than ones made with pb that has oil, sugar, mono- and di-glycerides and such.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've discovered a few things that make these easier to make. \r\n\r\nI don't measure the peanut butter, I just use an entire 18 ounce jar.\r\n\r\nI line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil, I don't try to move individual cookies to the cooling rack, I just slide the foil on to the cooling racks.\r\n\r\nI usually make a BIG batch of dough (2 or 3 jars) and shape most of the dough into 2 inch diameter rolls, wrap in foil and freeze. They keep for several months. When I'm ready to bake then, I let the dough thaw just a bit and slice it into 1/4 in slices and bake as usual.",

I cannot emphasize enough...NATURAL peanut butter. And not that new \"natural-no-stir\" garbage. Also, the sugar is a bit much for my taste, so I do as other reviewers and decrease by half a cup. If you're having trouble getting the consistency you want, don't be afraid to throw in a couple tablespoons of flour. White chocolate chunks will make an unforgettable combo. Again, I cannot emphasize enough, NATURAL peanut butter \u2013 the results will literally melt in your mouth.",

They were a little dry but that is probably because of using splenda instead of sugar.  But that's ok, when it comes to sugar free and low carb foods, you can't expect perfection.  I figured this out to be approximately 2.5 carbs per cookie and if you use all natural peanut butter it has 0 sugar content!  I used a cheap off brand peanut butter and they had a perfect shape! So this is a great low carb cookie as well as perfect for the diabetic!  THANK YOU!!!  God bless you for sharing this, I know that my Pastor will be thrilled when he gets these sugar free cookies (he's diabetic).",

A note to the reviewer who had trouble with crumbling. I've learned that this recipe has to be made with brand name/high quality peanut butter. They can turn out either crumbly or like hockey pucks otherwise! I cannot taste an appreciable difference in most peanut butters but I do know that there is something different and that difference makes a big difference in these cookies. Some store brand etc. pbs will work but it's hit-&-miss trial-&-error to figure out which will and which won't. It's easier to me to just make sure I've got Jif or something comparable on hand to make these.",
