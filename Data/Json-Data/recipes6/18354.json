I must say that the one soaked in sugar water did come out crispier. The difference in the taste was discernible at best, but you can totally tell that one was crispier than the other, so I would suggest that you use sugar as listed in the recipe. Wonderful french fries. Finally I can forget buying thosed frozen ones. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper.",

I tried cold sugar water, warm sugar water and cold plain water.  There was diffinately a difference with the sugar water which my son noticed as well.  There wasn't much of a difference with warm or cold sugar water, but our preference was the cold.  It just may have been the first batch we cooked.  Will be doing the cold sugar method from now on as these were good. At first I didn't think it would work because the potatoes were crisp in the plain cold water and interestingly, the sugar water made the potates softer before cooking.",

He said they were the best fries he has ever had (thats a big compliment because he doesn't really like french fries). I followed directions and they came out great but instead of seasoning the fries with salt I used McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic and Herb seasoning. It tasted great on the french fries. So I would suggest instead of just using plain salt on your fries, go to your spice rack and pick out a nice spice mix to put on your french fries. Seasoning salt tastes good too.",
