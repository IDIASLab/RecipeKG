Which gives you the real great taste of the cookie without tasting too buttery. You can add another 1/2 cup of flour to make the dough stay in shape better and not too sweet for those who does not like it too sweet. You can bake it longer for more crispy cookies and shorter for crispy edges and chewy middles!!",
