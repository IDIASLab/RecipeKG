They hold together much better once they've cooled.",

It did occur to me,  however,  to try the dried marshmallows you can buy for hot chocolate instead.  I do have some,  but they are at work so I will have to try that another time.  They might work better than regular marshmallows that tend to melt and stick--I am quite willing to go with other reviews here since I've baked with marshmallows before.  I essentially ended up with orange -y, cinnamon -y chocolate chip cookies and I really like them that way actually.  I ignored the baking instructions and baked at the normal 350 for 11 minutes.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!",
