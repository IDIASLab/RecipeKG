Not that that's a bad thing! These are in fact delicately spiced (I used all spices as directed) and just barely sweet which is actually refreshing for a muffin (if I want cake I'll eat cake). However if you like a sweeter muffin you could easily add a little more sugar. I used candy coated/chocolate covered sunflower seeds which I've learned bleed in wet batters! (But are great in cookie doughs) While the sunflower seeds were \"ok \" I think I'd rather have raisins dates or other dried fruit that might add that hint of sweetness and contrasting flavor that these missed for me. These are definitely flavorful moist and bake up with pretty domed tops. I left some of them as is and glazed the rest with a mixture of powdered sugar and lemon juice.",

I added one large grated carrot to the zucchini and used prune butter and 1 T of oil in place of the 1/3 cup of oil and left out the sunflower seeds entirely since I don't like them. Even with these changes the muffins came out really moist and fluffy and were very easy to eat and eat and eat. I did get quite of few of them though. I made 18 regular sized muffins and 20 mini muffins although that could have been because I added more to the batter (the carrot).",

I also used whole wheat flour pecans instead of sunflower seeds (only because my family isn't big on sunflower seeds) I cut the salt down to a pinch and the sugar down to a half cup (we're really watching our salt/sugar intake) and I kept all the spices and vanilla to a teaspoon for the twelve muffins. After folding the wet ingredients into the dry the mixture was still too dry. I needed to add another 3/4 cup of liquid to get it to combine and look like muffin batter. I did add 3/4 cup of lowfat buttermilk. The smell of these baking is really out of this world. All of us really enjoyed them though mine did turn out a little dry. It could just be because I did cut the recipe back or maybe I baked them too long or overmixed them due to the not enough liquid. Still a great muffin. I think next time I might add a half cup of organic raisins in the shredded zucchini step. Keeping the spices high in this recipe really negated the need for extra fat or sugar. This is a really flavorful zucchini muffin.",

I also skipped the sunflower seeds but these are great because I can make a large batch and they freeze really well. Take a couple out of the freezer just before going to bed and they're a great healthy grab-and-go pick. For an even healthier variety replace the eggs and oil with a small can of pumpkin- in this recipe you won't even taste the pumpkin and will cut down the fat content even more.",
