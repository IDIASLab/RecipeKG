I used 2 pounds ground beef, added onion & green pepper and bloomed the salt free chili spice packet into the beef after browned. Then added tomato paste to mix to allow flavor to develop. Added a dash of smoked paprika before putting in a slow cooker liner bag and adding rest of ingredients. Added extra 30 minutes high cooking time to compensate for liner bag. Turned out surprisingly well. Topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese & chopped green onion.",
