I have added many different flavorings in stead of the rum flavoring. I have made coconut eggnog bread, orange eggnong bread, (tastes like a creamsicle!), lemon, chocolate, maple, butter. The possibilities are endless. After Christmas I buy eggnog (when it goes on sale) I then separate it into 1 cup measurements. I freeze them so I can make this bread in the middle of summer. It dosen't change the flavor or texture of the eggnog. This is an awesome bread and will be making it many times. I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg, It's really good that way too. It does dry out quickly, but all that means it that you have to eat more of it!",

                "reviewBody": "The problem with this recipe is not in the ingredients, but in the directions. For those complaining that the bread was too dry and too dense, the problem occurs in your mixing stage. You need to cream the butter with the sugar first, this is very important in incorporating air into the mixture. The leavening agent can only enhance air that is already in the batter, it cannot create much \"new air\". Sugar is hygroscopic and absorbs a lot of water, by creaming the butter with the sugar, you coat the sugar with fats, preventing the sugar from stealing water from rest of the batter - this is why you have a dry bread. Also, I see some people saying they should add baking soda to enhance the recipe, don't do this. You don't have anything acidic to neutralize the baking soda, therefore you cannot create CO2. For those complaining it was bland, have you used freshly grated nutmeg? Ground nutmeg is very bitter and loses its volatile oils very quickly thus losing flavour.",

After reading through a lot of reviews and combining various ideas, here were my modifications:\n*  Increased eggnog to 1-1/2 cups\n*  Used 3 Tbl dark rum instead of the extract\n*  Increased vanilla to 2 tsp.\n*  Instead of 1/2 c butter, I used 1/4 c butter plus 1/4 cup oil\n*  Doubled the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.\n*  Added 1 packet (from 3.4 oz box) of vanilla pudding powder and sifted it in with the flour.\n*  I creamed the sugar, oil & butter until it was light and fluffy before adding the eggs, etc.  I added the eggs one at a time, mixing between eggs.\n*  Added a glaze - it came out very thick like a frosting, but melted into a nice glaze when spread on the hot bread.  I used 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp butter, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1-1/2 Tbl eggnog and 1-1/2 tsp rum.  (Note: it made a plenty of glaze for a thin layer.)  After the bread came out of the oven I let it sit for about 5 minutes, then poked some holes in it with a cake tester and spread a thin layer of the glaze on top. \n\nI got 4 full mini loaves out of this.  I left a little bit of room when filling the pans to allow room for the glaze, and they came out nice and rounded on top.  \n\nCan not tell you how delicious and moist and flavorful this is!  It's fairly sweet with the glaze, so it's filling.  But we thought the glaze added great flavor.",
