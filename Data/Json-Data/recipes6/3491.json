I tweaked it a bit by adding some cinnamon to the pear mix and as I do not keep whole wheat flour on hand I added a small amount of gluten flour to the all purpose.  Added a bit more milk to soften up the batter and topped it off with some homemade cherry ice cream in the Vitamix!  :)  Made it again in less than 2 days so it was that good!",
