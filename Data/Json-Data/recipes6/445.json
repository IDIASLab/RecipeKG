I am out of fish sauce, so I used lite soy sauce in lieu of that. I completely forgot to add the sugar! The peanut butter I used is this great product made by Earth Balance called coconut & peanut spread. It's creamy and requires no stirring. The hint of coconut was wonderful in this recipe. I immediately spread the mixture on a baguette and had a tasty lunch. It would be great on warm noodles too. This one is a keeper: simple and tasty. Next time I'll try with the suger, but it doesn't seem necessary.",
