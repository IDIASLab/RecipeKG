I don't usually go more than 50/50 applesauce/oil (or butter) when trying to lower fat in recipes but this recipe was a pleasant surprise in that area. That said I did feel that the cranberries (fresh) tartness was very strong for this muffin so I would suggest (& I'll try this next time I make them) is either using dried or tossing your fresh berries w/ a bit of stevia/sugar/whatever sweetener you use and letting that sit while you prep the rest of the batter. That should bring out the sweetness a bit more. I also think next time I'd add and extract (like orange/vanilla). I also used part white whole wheat flour in this recipe with no problems in texture/taste.",
