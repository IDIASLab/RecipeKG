Double the lime juice. Salsa increased to 12oz and add a teaspoon of chives (or one shoot of freshly chopped scallion green onion ). Add 2 (or 3) chopped pickled jalape\u00f1os. Add a pinch of salt and a bit of ground black pepper. Much better!:D 4/5 for my recipe. I will be modifying again next time. Will update.",

I'm only making meals for two and I used dry beans so I cut down the amount of beans by half. I didn't have any salsa so I chopped up a few tomatoes.. (they weren't overly juicy so it still seemed slightly lacking in the liquid department.. but that was my fault..) I made a basic pico de gallo as the salsa (tomatoes jalapeno onion lots and lots of cilantro and garlic). I used the full amount of everything else and I added half a red pepper and half a yellow pepper. Hubby said that he liked it a lot but it was missing 'something'... I think it was salt... because I used dried beans.. I'll probably make it again.. but my recipe box has SOOOO many recipes in it that I want to try... who knows when I'll get around to it..
