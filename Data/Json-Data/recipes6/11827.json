                "reviewBody": "I wanted a sugar cookie that called for cream of tartar specifically as I like the light sandy texture it imparts to cookies. I also wanted butter not shortening but not a combination of butter and vegetable oil. The helpful ingredient search identified this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for. For what I had in mind I skipped the raisins used vanilla instead of lemon extract and in keeping with spring added a cup of pastel-colored sprinkles instead. As I mixed up the dough I found I could easily do without 1/2 cup of the flour so I used 3 c. flour rather than 3-1/2. I used a medium-sized scoop probably about 2 T. and baked the cookies at 375 degrees rather than 400 until set but before they began to turn brown. Given variances in size and individual ovens I'd say 8-9 minutes. The cookies are pretty and crackly soft (like Hubs likes 'em) but still a little chewy (the way I like 'em!). Bottom line? This was just what I was after a quick and simple attractive soft buttery sugar cookie!",

The dough was super dry even though I soaked my raisins in hot water before adding them to the batter which added a little moisture. They baked up well though and are pretty little cookies. The lemon and raisins are a nice combination. Thanks!:)",
