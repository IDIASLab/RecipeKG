My big sister used to make these for me when I was young, but she couldn't remember how so I once again looked to allrecipes for help. I was not disappointed! I took the advice of others and only used 2 2/3 c. flour. Ultimately, I used all but appr. 1/4 c. to achieve the right consistency. I also increased the sugar to appr. 1/2 c. (it just wasn't sweet enough for us) and added 1 t. vanilla. Excellent! Saved the left over batter for the next time we're having a craving!",
