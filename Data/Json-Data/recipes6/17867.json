The only thing that I had to change is that when you first start cooking this, bring to a boil then reduce to medium heat and wait for the berries to burst.  Otherwise it doesn't get as thick as you would expect. I figured this out based on reviewing other similar cranberry sauce recipes before making this one.  I decided upon this one because of all the spices that were in this. They really made a delicious cranberry sauce.",

After reading other reviews, I decreased sugar to about 1 1/2 cups and I grated the zest of one small orange right over the pot as it cooked, which I think gave it just the right layering of flavors without overpowering it.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper and has now joined my holiday recipe collection.",

We give this 5 stars with our modifications: substituted the water for orange juice halved the sugar eliminated the spice bag itself and just tossed in the cinn sticks and cloves (easy to remove before refrigeration). We also sprinkled in a bit of pumpkin pie spice. FYI - it took much longer than 15 minutes cooking time for all the berries to burst. Overall smelled fantastic while cooking & was a huge success at the table.",

OMG!!! This cranberry sauce is so tasty delicious tangy and easy to make! I rarely follow any cooking recipe to a \"tee \" so I did improvise a bit. I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and instead of bundling spices I used a few pinches of nutmeg a few pinches of cinnammon and an exotic mixture of dried allspice (with ginger anise clove cinammon & nutmeg). I went VERY EASY (a spinkle or two) with this exotic allspice 'cause I didn't want the sauce to become too bitter. Also the cranberries sugar & water DO need to cook for approxiamtely 20 minutes to get a true sauce consistency. But ohhhhh so good! I cannot believe how tasty this recipe turned out with a deep red color...so pretty too! Cannot wait to serve this cranberry sauce to my family for Thanksgiving! Thank you!",
