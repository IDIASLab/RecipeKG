I followed the recipe exactly except for a couple of substitutions: instead of milk (I was out) I used a mixture of heavy cream and water (2 parts water three parts heavy cream) instead of chicken broth (I was out of that too) I mixed some water and chicken flavored Top Ramen mix together and it turned out great. I used extra sharp aged cheddar cheese which gave it a nice flavor. I also added a pinch of Tony's Cajun seasoning and topped the whole thing off with paprika. Really delicious especially if you have some extra catfish and don't know what to do with it.",
