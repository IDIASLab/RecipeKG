Rubber cookies did not disappoint! They actually tasted great right out of the oven a lot like gingerbread cookies. But I also wanted to try the week-long airtight storage with the half-apple because it just sounded too out-there not to try. When we opened the lid we were a bit disconcerted to find the apple moldy. We cut off the portions of cookie that were touching the apple and that was the extent of the unpleasantness. The cookies tasted the same as they did at first and were even somewhat rubbery. I like to say they're a cross between ginger snaps and beef jerky! I took them to church and left them in the church office without telling them the name of the cookies. They were all eaten in short time. In fact our Senior Pastor Bob -- a lover of fine foods --took one home and his wife even wrote me asking for the recipe!",
