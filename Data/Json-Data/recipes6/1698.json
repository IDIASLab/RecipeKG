I followed the recipe exactly and while it's tastes like 5 stars there are a couple things I would change. First don't mix the raisons into the filling. I found I had to spread the raisons around to get them even and it started to tear the pastry! Just sprinkle the raisons on the crust before pouring the filling on. If you're using a non-stick pan overhang a layer of parchment paper so you can lift and cut the squares without cut marks in your pan. Otherwise a fantastic treat thanks to Billy Boy!",

My changes: add 1/4 tsp salt to each base and filling as I use unsalted butter, reduce flour in base to 1 1/4 cups, substitute 8 oz by weight coarsely chopped pecans, bake 35 minutes. I let cool then freeze, I find it easier to cut them. Remember to line the pan with parchment paper to make easier clean up and to lift them from the pan. I cut into 25 squares (5x5) since they are rich.",
