This recipe is the culmination of learning how to make BBQ ribs for competition, plus learning from my family members who are all pressure cooker experts. The end result, after years of trial and error, will have everybody licking their fingers in complete ecstasy. You can save a few teaspoons of BBQ sauce, throw it into 2 boxes of mac and cheese, and serve the ribs alongside.",
