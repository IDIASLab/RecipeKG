I did cook this in the oven in double wrapped foil. Also I used parchment paper to line the baking tray for easy cleanup. I am glad I did because one of the packets leaked. The chicken was tender and moist. My family likes extra sauce so we had small bowls of bbq sauce for dipping. I used cherry tomatoes which did make the sauce watery. I will make this again and will not use the tomatoes. You will have to watch that the chicken doesn't overcook. I checked the chicken with a meat thermometer after twenty minutes and two of the chicken breasts were ready to eat. Also I wasn't sure how much corn to put in each packet since I had a large bag of corn. I think next time I will use a cup of corn for each foil packet. Thanks Angie for sharing your wonderful recipe!",
