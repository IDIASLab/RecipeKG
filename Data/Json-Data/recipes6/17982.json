And second when you use butter instead of shortening in a cookie dough the cookies will spread more if the butter is softened TOO much. If that happens just refrigerate the cookie dough for an hour and the cookies should bake up higher instead of flatter. If trying the recipe for the first time don't leave the butter out too long before making the dough. 15 minutes at room temperature should be enough.",
