However I found the batter extremely dry and hard to stir. Mixing in the grated carrots was like kneading dough for bread. I had to use four times the amount of juice called for and it was still very hard to stir. I suppose it could have been because I used store-bought grated carrots which are probably a little drier than freshly-grated carrots. The end result wasn't too bad but I think I will try an oil-based recipe next time.",
