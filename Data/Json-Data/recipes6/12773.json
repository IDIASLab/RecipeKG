I've been looking for a great recipe for years making homemade cookies without chocolate chips I would always have the problem with them poofing up too high and getting cakey. These turned out great. They settled about 1/4 inch thick and browned nicely around the edges. I only kept them in the oven for 6 1/2 mintues and let them finish baking on the sheet outside the over for 3 more minutes before I removed them to a cooling rack. The kids gobbled them all up immediately!",
