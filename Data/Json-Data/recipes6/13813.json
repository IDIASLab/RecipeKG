That's not a problem with the recipe, just an issue of personal tastes and preferences.  Here are the quantities I used: \r\n8 ounces spaghetti\r\n1 bunch green onions, sliced  (white parts only)\r\n(for the onions, I had access to spring bermuda onions which worked very well)\r\n1 tablespoon sesame oil\r\n1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root\r\n2 cloves garlic, minced\r\n1/3 + 2 TBS cup peanut butter\t\r\n1/8 cup soy sauce\r\n1/3 cup hot water\r\n1 tablespoon cider or rice) vinegar\r\n1 teaspoon white sugar\r\n1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (I used a couple pinches of cayenne pepper powder)\r\n\r\nI reduced the amount of soy because 1/4 cup seemed like too much sodium for me.  I also tripled the ginger (1 TBS instead of 1 tsp) because I like a good, strong ginger flavor and it really turned out well.  I also increased the water from 1/4 to 1/3 cup since I reduced the amount of liquid when I decreased the soy sauce.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic which I added to the oil/onions with the ginger.  \r\n\r\nAs I alluded  to before, the sign of a truly good recipe is one that can be easily altered to suit individual preferences!  Very happy with this recipe.",

Use light soy sauce instead of regular (much less salty), and scramble 2 eggs along with the scallions. In addition, use rice noodles instead of spaghetti. Also, crunchy peanut butter (instead of smooth) gives it a nice texture. Garnish with either a few tablespoons of crushed peanuts, cilantro or sesame seeds.",

To make the sauce more liquidy, add some chicken broth or my favorite, some coconut milk from a can.",
