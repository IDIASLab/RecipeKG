I put pecans on the top edge like the picture and made the pecan glaze as suggested with 1 cup whipping cream, 3/4 cup maple syrup (I used imitation).  I didn't add the glaze until right before serving.  I omited the vanilla and lemon extracts and the flavor was perfect.

Pumpkin pie fans and non-fans enjoyed this creation and I can't wait to bring it home for Thanksgiving this year. The crust is extra-fancy tasting with the pecans. You can taste the highly recognizbale cheesecake flavor and harmonious blend of pie spices with each bite. The extra effort pays off in the end. I cooked mine in a water bath cracked the oven door open after turning off the stove and chilled over night. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",

The pecans in the crust were wonderful. There wasn't anything about this recipe that wasn't perfect. I did add nutmeg to mine instead of the mace but I doubt that changed the flavor too much. Thank you so much for sharing!!! 7/20/12-we tried this one again and it was a winner!!!",

The cornstarch in this recipe actually helps the cake from cracking,  so don't skip it!  For me, I take a small oven safe bowl and put water in it and place it on a lower rack in the oven.  That is to put some moisture in the oven.  After 50 minutes or so, I just turn off the oven and leave the cake in it.  As the oven cools, so does the cake.  Leave it in the oven for about another hour, then I take out the cake.  I run a knife around the edge to make sure that none is sticking to the sides (prevent cracking as the cake cools and shrinks).  Only after the cake is completely cooled, then cover it with foil (in the pan!) and place in the refrigerator.  You should make this a full day ahead of serving (if not longer).  The cake is fantastic and you will have people begging for the recipe!!",

Hence why so many comments metioned that they made different toppings and sauces. Next time I would definitely cut the butter in half. It made the crust soggy. I have seen other recipes that add more cream and I think I like those better.",
