She said it was EXCELLENT, and that it looked like a professional bakery pie! GOOD INFO TO KNOW: Most important - MELT THE ICE CREAM IN THE MICROWAVE UNTIL IT'S *WARM*! This prevents separating. I didn't use room temp eggs (forgot). Don't add flour to thicken - it's really not needed. It will look very runny, but have faith  :o)  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I didn't add vanilla, but will do so in the future. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of using separate spices, but still used cinnamon separately as well - and added a bit extra. The recipe WILL fill two 9\" reg. depth pie crusts - do NOT fill to very top and they'll be fine. Filling will take a total of *1 full hour* AFTER the initial 15 minutes. BE SURE TO COVER YOUR CRUSTS WITH FOIL!!! I forgot, and they almost burned in the first 15 min. phase. Filling will \"poof up\" almost 2 inches above crust during baking and settle back down during cooling. Do not \"STIR\" pie!!! Not needed - have faith!  :o) I will definitely make this a Thanksgiving favorite!",

A trick that I found works for me is after it has finished baking (about 35 mins) take it out of the oven and stir the pie in the crust. Be carful not to brake the crust on the bottom and sides. then cover only the exposed crust with foil (So it doesn't burn) then put it back in the oven for another 20 mins. It's great with home made whip cream YUM!",
