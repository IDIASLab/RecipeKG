Have to be very exact with ingredient amounts or can turn out runny, but recipe delivers as advertised. Just be sure to drain the sweet potato's thoroughly after cooking. I did alter the 8 serving portion a bit for personal taste: it's very sweet, so reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup; added 3/4 tsp each of ground cinnamon and allspice; used evaporated milk instead of regular milk...makes for a creamier mixture; and be careful not to overdo the pecans (one cup is a lot!). Everyone always wants seconds!!",

I had to bake it for more than 35 minutes...more like 45-50 minutes.  Yummy!  I'll be making this for every holiday.  Added 12/22/06:  I also made it this year and it's just as yummy!  This time I baked the same 1.5 times the recipe and split into two 2-quart trays, and baked it for about 45 minutes.  It was yummy and made it easy to bake one recipe for two potlucks.",

Once he saw this, before I could say that it was to take for a Dinner, he was dishing up a big serving. He ate every bite and had 3rds and he hates sweet potatoes! I made more and it was a instant hit. Also made it for a large church dinner (100+people) I made 40 batches and we still ran out. I was asked for the receipe so much that I printed out over a 100 of them. This is definatly a huge hit at any holiday dinner. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe it will always be on our table.
