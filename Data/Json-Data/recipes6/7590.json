Even though I cooked it for extra time it just seemed like uncooked batter. The 2nd time we made it with eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla and I also added 1/4 C extra sugar. That time it was ok a fine gluten free alternative but not as good as my mom's brownie recipe. I might try it once more without the baking powder or soda and I would try purring the beans longer to see if it could be improved.",
