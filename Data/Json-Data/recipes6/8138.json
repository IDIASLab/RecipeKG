I found that when I put some water on the wrapper near the end of the roll, they stayed together beautifully.  My husband raved over these.  I used salad shrimp that I chopped in the food chopper.  I also used bag cole slaw mix and added some onion and garlic.  Really a great recipe.  Thank you Cindi.",
