I love them and these are some of the best I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing about the spice blend.  I love the fact that this recipe doesn't call for alot of salt compared to some other recipes.  You don't need it.  The spice  blend gives the peanuts tons of flavor.  If you are afraid of the heat, don't be.   These have a little kick, but they won't send you running for the milk jug.  It took about 26 hrs for mine to cook the way I like them.",

                "reviewBody": "I'm on board with Rachael (submitter of recipe)...if you don't know what \"boiled peanuts\" are all about, then don't submit a bad rating due to texture issues! I'm a northerner but have lived in the south and got hooked on these. I like this flavor way better then just plain salted ones. I used organic dry raw peanuts (2lbs) cuz when I got my craving, green peanuts weren't in season. I soaked my peanuts overnight in cold water (weighed em down w/a plate) drained, then proceeded with the recipe. I didn't use 'crab boil' - added some Old Bay. I also added a bottle of Honey Brown Ale initially and cooked in a 8QT heavy stock pot on the stove. If you store the pot in the fridge overnight (after cooking for 12 hrs) the peanuts tend to suck up more liquid and will finally sink down; then continue cooking next day. You have to sample one here n there until you get the texture you prefer. If you don't use green peanuts you may have to cook longer. If I had a pressure cooker I would try method mentioned. All I can say is if you want crunchy peanuts, don't try these or rate poorly because these are meant to be softish (like canned kidney beans). I like mine soft, but that's a personal pref. In any case, love the additional spice profile!",
