The changes I made were 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter instead of 1 cup butter, 3 cups flour and 5 cups oatmeal, not 4 and 4, 4 teaspoons of vanila instead of 2, 3/4 cup of the candy not 1 cup and add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Also these cookies bake up best when they are large. I roll the cookie dough into a ball slightly larger than a golf ball. If you try to make smaller cookies you end up with a lot of the candy and chocolate chips on the outside of the cookie not baked inside. I always make the full recipe and freeze most of them. These are delicious fresh but tend to stale quickly. I freeze any cookies that won't be eaten in 3-4 days. They defrost quickly and taste as though they were baked that day",

The texture from the oatmeal chocolate chips and M & M's (which is what I use) is perfect. These cookies turn out perfect every time I bake them. I attribute this to the stoneware which I use to bake cookies. I also use real butter in place of the margarine. (Cookies without REAL butter just taste blah in my opinion.)

Instead of maragine I added an additional 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Next time I may change to add a little more peanut butter because I like the taste of peanut butter it was not overpowering though. Since I made this for bake sale I used red and blue M&M's for the candy. I also sprinkled red white and blue sprinkles on top before baking. They looked so festive. BEWARE this recipe makes a ton of cookies I ended up with like 9 dozen you may want to half the recipe.",

Shaped into 2 inch balls or larger and placed a giant craft stick in the center of the balls. I than flattened slightly with a fork.
