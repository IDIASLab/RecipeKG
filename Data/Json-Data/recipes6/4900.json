It's both filling and delicious - and makes enough to last a week! I've been adding spinach (probably 3 cups-ish of fresh baby spinach) to the recipe which adds some bulk to make it a meal on it's own. I've found that almost any veggies I have on hand can easily be added to the recipe (avocado celery carrots etc.). I've also subbed pecans for almonds when I rand out of almonds. Super forgiving recipe!",

If you can find sheep's milk feta I would suggest you try it in this salad it's not as sharp tasting as goat's milk feta and I find it has a slightly creamier texture.
