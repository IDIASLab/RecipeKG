I only used 6 cans of cannellini beans and 2 pounds of pasta but it was way too much pasta in my opinion it took over and that was all you could see and taste. Next time I'll only use 1/4 pound for the recipe as written or 1 pound for the quadrupled amount. Since the cannellini beans are the same color as the pasta I may use red kidney beans next time for a nice contrast. Or stick with the cannellini and use spinach pasta instead. Everyone loved the taste but agreed that it was too much pasta.",
