She seemed to really enjoy it. I didn't frost it bc I didn't want it to be too messy but it's nice even without frosting. She really seemed to enjoy it. It is a bit dry but maybe some sour cream or something would address that. She said she would have some for breakfast tomorrow with coffee; it is a bit like a breakfast coffee cake so it's a hit.:o) Thanks for the recipe!",
