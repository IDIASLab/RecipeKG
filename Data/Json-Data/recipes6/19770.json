Used balsamic vinegar. Instead of tomato juice I used a can of Picante V8 and a can of petite cut diced tomatoes. Added fresh rosemary and mushrooms at that point used frozen green beans (16 oz.) and Tabasco Chipotle Sauce for the heat. Also had to thicken the sauce with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch etc. and served over brown rice. Beautiful presentation... if everyone had not dug in so quickly I would have loved to have taken a photo! Will most likely make this recipe again. Thank you BRIDESTEIN.",
