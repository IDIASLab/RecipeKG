I've made this twice and recommend filling 2 shells(Mrs Smith's 9\")instead of one, replace milk with half and half, increase lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  If not set in 40 minutes of baking, watch closely or every few minutes to finish; you may need to cover the crust edges to prevent thse from overbaking.  After baking, allow to cool fully then refridgerate for at least several hours or overnight before serving. With my alterations, 1/8 of each pie is 5 points on WeightWatchers. Worth every point!",

I thought it had a great lemon taste. I did have some problem with it setting up but I put it in the frig for an hour or so after baking and cooling and it set up fine. It IS time consuming to grate all of that lemon zest. It probably took 6 lemons to get 3 TBSPNs of zest. My husband did the grating though! Thanks for the post we had fun making this (my 3yo patted the pie crust!) thanks for a good family kitchen memory! Note: I used REAL butter in this not margarine. That may have something to do with people's reviews. I think real butter is needed for this kind of pie. Also as another sidenote my husband did not like this pie and I almost bumped it down a star. But then he rarely likes anything I make much less desserts so to be fair I left my 4 star rating.(:",
