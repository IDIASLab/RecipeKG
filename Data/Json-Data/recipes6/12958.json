The dough was dry and crumbly so I expected the resulting cookie to be the same. NOT! The cookie is just how I like them and don't often get - crunchy! Finally a crunchy (and crispy too obviously from the Rice Krisipies) chocolate chip cookie! Hmmmm the dry and somewhat crumbly dough made for a crunchy cookie - that makes sense! I suppose if you're not a crunchy cookie lover like I am you could always use half brown sugar instead of all white or add an extra egg or a little less flour or add a little milk any or all of which would make for a more moist chewy cookie - or move on to another recipe altogether because this one is just fine as is and I'm sure was designed to have the appealling crunch I love. I used a 1 T. scoop which made for cute perfectly shaped little cookies great for popping in your mouth one after another.",
