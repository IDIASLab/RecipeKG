Considering some of those reviews let's start with what these cookies at least the cookies I made are not. They're not crumbly cakey puffy or fluffy. Nor are they flaky oily or moist. They're not shortbread. And they certainly don't fall apart. I'm no scientist so I don't know the reason WHY this happens but I do know that when I see a cookie recipe that calls for oil and cream of tartar the cookie is going to be light as a feather airy tender and somewhat sandy in texture. I love that kind of cookie and that's exactly how these turned out. If you're looking for the more familiar chewy chocolate chip cookie this is not it. It's different like comparing apples and oranges but every bit as delicious if not better than a lot of them! Did I do something different than other reviewers whose experience was different than mine? I used a medium-sized cookie scoop flattened the cookies just slightly and baked just until they started to get golden around the edges. These cookies dotted with Valentine's Day M&M's will be making their way to Minneapolis tomorrow to be given to two grown \"kids.\" I'll be starting out with 36 good sized cookies. It will be interesting to see how many of these are left to give them after the 6-hour drive!",

My husband still prefers traditional chocolate chip cookies but enjoyed these too. They are the best soon after taking them out of the oven. I would make only what you plan on consuming that night then refrigerate or freeze the rest of the dough. If there are leftovers microwave if possible. They're still good the next day just not as \"to-die-for\" in my opinion. I also tried cooking them in a 375 oven for 8-10 minutes and I thought it worked better. They were slightly golden brown and crisp on the outside soft on the inside. Maybe it was just my oven but 350 dried them out a bit by the time the tops started to turn golden.",

For 10 years I've been trying to duplicate the chocolate chip cookies that were sold in a bakery nearby. That search has finally ended! Normally I favor chewy cookies of any variety but this is different and oh so delicious. It's a slightly soft slightly crumbly thick textured cookie. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except for using half of the chocolate chips (personal preference). I did find that I needed to cook them a bit longer than 10 minutes but my spoonfuls were rather heaping. Allow to sit on sheet for 2-3 minutes before moving to wire racks as they are fragile when hot. From now on this will be the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I will use. Simply fabulous!",
