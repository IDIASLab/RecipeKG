With these ingredients this is a healthy vegetarian soup with a complete protein. If you add the chili powder, leave out the maple syrup. It totally changes the taste.

If you choose the chili powder (add it right before the broth)  the flavor is kind of reminiscent of chili, if you leave out the chili powder and use the maple syrup instead, you get my 8 year old daughter's favorite soup in the world.;-)  Of course, you may substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and it still tastes wonderful, but obviously it is no longer vegetarian.

I added in the maple syrup and 1 tbls of the chili powder.  I also added in 4 servings of whole grain brown rice while simmering to add more \"bulk\" to the soup.  We grated cheddar cheese over the tops of our bowls and let it melt....soooo good!  This recipe made a huge pot that will feed my family of 4 for 2 meals, and cost less than $5!!
