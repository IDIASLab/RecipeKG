I have tried other recipes which include brown sugar, and have determined that brown sugar has too bold a flavor for the delicate white chocolate and macadamia nuts.  Trust me-- this recipe is absolutely fabulous.\n\nUPDATE:  My husband and I love these cookies so much that we make the dough, freeze the uncooked dough balls on a cookie sheet, put them in a zip-lock bag, and keep a supply handy at all times.  Whenever we crave them, we'll pop a few out of the bag and bake at 350 for about 15-18 minutes.  Awesome.",

I have no idea how anyone could get 4 dozen cookies from this recipe. Also, I used slightly less nuts then the recipe called for and white chocolate chips instead of chopped chunks. I had my first cookie when it was warm but it was much better the next day when it had completely cooled. It seemed to have a better flavor and texture. The only thing I didn't like was that the chips browned on the bottom of the cookie so they didn't look too pretty looking at them from the bottom.",
