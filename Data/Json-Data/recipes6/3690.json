While at the store I accidentally bought 'Caribbean Jerk Marinade' instead of teriyaki sauce and rather than go back to the store, I decided to wing it and see what happens. I ended up liking the results enough that I decided to replace the store-bought sauce with a jerk spice mixture, and this recipe was born.",
