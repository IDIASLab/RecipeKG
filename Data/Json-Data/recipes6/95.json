I did make a few changes I used yellow onions did not add sugar (who needs the extra carbs)?! Besides the port makes it truly scrumptious. I did use 50oz of beef consomm\u00e9 added a splash of liquid smoke and let the extra liquid cook off w/the lid removed for about an hour. I m sure my changes only slightly changed the results - it was delicious!!",
