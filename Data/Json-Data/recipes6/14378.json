It loses any points for simplicity because of the effort you have to go into to make the meringue. However it's good because it doesn't use real chocolate so you can use the cocoa you have on hand. I think if you are going to spend time making meringue for a pie you might as well make a good centre for it. The custard isn't really worth it. But it's good just as custard.",
