        "description": "I drank bubble tea every day when I visited Taiwan, and decided to bring back some tapioca pearls (boba) to make my own at home. This is a versatile recipe: you can vary the type of tea and milk you use, and sweeten it to taste. Brew tea to your preferred strength, though it's a good idea to use strong tea because you're going to dilute it with milk and ice. You'll need a wide straw to drink up the boba, or use a long spoon to fish them out!",
