My main problem with this is that I really didn't care for lemon with potatoes. Just kind of a strange combination of flavors to me. But I loved the seasoned butter with the carrots so next time around I'll skip the spuds and mix the carrots with other veggies. Zucchini broccoli cauliflower... I think they'd all be great. Also looking forward to trying this with fresh herbs from the garden this summer. Thanks Mikki!",

I used the amt of potatoes/carrots required AND I added 1 small head of broccoli chopped and a small sliced zuchinni and there was still a pool of butter at the bottom of my dish.
