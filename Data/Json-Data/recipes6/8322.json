                "reviewBody": "I submitted this recipe so keep in mind the rating is biased...unfortunately the editors took out my notes from the original submission but I think there are a couple of things that will help prepare this. 1) Curry paste is a mixture of curry powder ghee lemongrass and other spices. It can be found commercially at places like Amazon or high end grocery stores like Bristol-Farms in San Francisco. Any color/flavor of curry will do as per your preference. They even have variety packs you can get. 2) One can substitute lite coconut milk and it is 60% less calories and fat and tastes the same (also available at places like Amazon). 3) Add 1 tablespoon or more curry paste depending on your spice level desired. 1 T is about low-medium spice. If you over-spice add more brown sugar (this only works to a limiting degree). 4) Prepare and stir in rice or cellophane noodles for added texture. Also can be served over rice or with naan. 5) Mix up the vegetables. Add cubed potatoes beans mushrooms or whatever. Frozen vegetables can easily be added.",

After an hour cut the tofu into triangles and sprinkle yellow thai curry on both sides. Fry in 2tbls of olive oil and add to the dish when it is in the last 5 minutes of cooking.)",

I used bean sprouts brocolli shitake mushrooms green pepper carrot green onion and sweet onion and cabbage I had on hand. I added a little of the juice from the canned pineapple mixed with cornstarch as well as having added the cornstarch per directions. I cooked Orzo to use in lieu of rice. Probably could have added the Orzo when simmering as far as that goes. It was too much work de-fatting the thighs...I'll use boneless skinless thighs next time...or tenders...or breasts.
