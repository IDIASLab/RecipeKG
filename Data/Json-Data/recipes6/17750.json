It was a coconut bar w/ lemon and I think this was as close to what I used to have as I could find. It is soooo good. The only thing I remember being different was that the egg mixture( the way I used to make it) was a brownish color- so I added a tsp. of vanilla and instead of a whole cup of sugar I added half brown and half white for a full cup. We are having our house worked on and let me tell you something food is a wonderul motivator! These bars went fast and they were begging for more- I have made three bathches in the past week! Thank you so much-it is delicious!",
