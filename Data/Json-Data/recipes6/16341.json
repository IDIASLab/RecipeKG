After reading other reviews I put mine on the quick bread cycle which on my machine is called the \"cake\" cycle for 10 minutes until it beeped and I scraped the edges down. I then realized I had probably selected the wrong cycle and switched it to the \"rapid\" cycle which bakes for 1:50 minutes. This turned out a moist beautiful loaf that could easily be mistaken for white bread were it not for the nutty flavor of the spelt and the sheer goodness of it.",
