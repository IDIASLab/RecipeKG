I used plain yogurt instead of milk/cream as a low-fat alternative, which provided a nice, thicker consistency. Since I prefer extra spicy foods, I also added in an additional teaspoon (or two) of the cumin. Using cauliflower instead of potatoes in the recipe provides a light texture, which complements starchy side dishes such as rice. Overall, I highly recommend this dish.",

Boy am I glad I did!  I made it just as it said (except I used a packet of soup and half the water it called for) and it was so extremely flavorful.  I served it with naan and guferati (Indian green beans) from this site and my hubby just raved and raved!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Added note:  Be sure to not skimp on the time of cooking the spices.  This seems to be a vital step in releasing the full flavor of the spices.  The second time I made it, it wasn't nearly as flavorful and the only difference was that I was in a hurry and just stirred them around a bit this time.  It was still good, but not wow good like the first time.",

Also, make sure you watch your ingredients that have too many additives (like the soup) as these additives really take away from the clean, refreshing simplicity this dish  embodies.  It's also full of digestible protein and most little kids love it!",
