Made it a second time and used 2/3 block cream cheese, 1/4 c. brown sugar, added some nutmeg, cayenne pepper (because I like a kick) and the slightest touch of curry.  Also used a lot more black pepper.  Didn't use all of the broth because I like it thick!  ***UPDATE: For those of you who are very pleased with your soup, the next time you make it, could you give an estimate of how much squash (in cups) that you use? I made it again and I think both squash were too big.\r\nThank you for an excellent recipe - I served mine with 1/2 an asiago bagel and a sliced honeycrisp apple.",

This is the best butternut squash soup I've ever had. I used Splenda Brown Sugar rather than the real stuff and low cal cream cheese and it's still out of this world. I added very little instant potatoes to thicken the soup and a pinch of nutmeg. I ll be making this for Thanksgiving for sure!",
