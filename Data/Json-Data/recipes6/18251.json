These donuts are baked not fried, so they don't have so many calories. I mix up either a powdered sugar glaze or a chocolate icing to top these with. They can also be rolled in cinnamon and white sugar, but it doesn't stick very well. My husband likes them just plain. For a chocolate glaze, simply stir 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips into the glaze mixture.",

                "reviewBody": "If you are expecting these to taste like a fried donut you will be disappointed.  For a baked donut, though, they are *very* good.  And do not expect them to brown--they will be pale.  They are done when they spring back to a light touch.  If you bake them till they brown they are dry.  I make them with only 1T of melted butter (to save on calories--it doesn't affect the donuts), then spray them on both sides with butter-flavored cooking spray after they come out of the oven. I also add plenty of cinnamon to the glaze (we like cinnamon a lot) and it makes them taste like the powdered sugar/cinnamon donuts only they do not shed.  The texture is a little different than a fried cake donut--lots lighter (not sure where others are getting denser).  The hardest part is getting the right amount of batter into the donut pan =D.   The batter is extremely stiff, and does take some getting used to as far as transferring it into the donut pan. It helps to take a toothpick and run it through the batter--it seals up the edges of the batter so they come out circular instead of  like a sealed \"c.\"  It also takes some of the air bubbles out of the batter, so the bottoms are prettier and not all cratered.   From the above recipe you will get ~48 mini donuts.  We love them!  Next time I will try the chocolate.  Or maybe half chocolate and half cinnamon glazed.",

Honestly, I made this recipe twice this morning. The first time was unsuccessful because I overfilled the doughnut pans (and honestly, I think that the baking time was too low) and the doughnuts were underdone and kind of gross. The second time, I slowed my roll. I used a tablespoon of batter on each side of the doughnut pan, banged the pan down on the counter a few times (which my mother always taught me to do with cakes, not only to even the batter but to also try to eliminate some of the air bubbles), then I baked them for eight minutes at 425*. The second time they turned out perfect. They're exactly as the title states--fluffy and cake-y. I got 18 muffins out of one recipe. I used my Grandma's Vanilla Glaze for these doughnuts instead of the one called for in this recipe. My husband and kids ate 12 doughnuts all on their own, I sent the other 6 to my aunt's house for her family. This was a good learning experiance for the first time I've ever used a doughnut pan. I'll use this recipe again.",
