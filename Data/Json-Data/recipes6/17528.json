FOUR cups of chocolate chips?? Seemed like a lot. So I added some oatmeal to take up some of the space. Now I see there are 5 reviews and others survived without adding any egg. The batch I made also came out puffy but at least they didn't run into each other on the cookie sheet. I'm waiting for someone else to taste them though. I am having a hard time getting past the anticipation of the mixture of molasses and chocolate flavors but wanted to try a new cookie recipe to add to my collection.

I also didn't have any ground ginger so I used juice from fresh ginger. I also only used 3 cups of chocolate chips. The family loved it even my husband who rarely wants any cookie unless it is a chocolate chip cookie. He said that if he had had a glass of milk (which we were out of) he would hardly have noticed it wasn't a regular chocolate chip cookie.
