I didn't have dried onions so I thinly sliced some sweet onions and sprinkled the rings in the salad.  I also eliminated the poppy seeds and it was fine. The only thing I would change next time is to lessen the amount of sugar by a few tablespoons.  The balsamic vinegar is already so sweet.  But the sugar makes it thick and clingy so take out too much.",
