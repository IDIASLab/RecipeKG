I doubled the chili powder and added 2 cloves of diced garlic to the veggies and found it to be STILL mild but very tasty... but I live in California where Mexican food is commonplace and spicy.  I also increased the cumin by half and it could have probably been doubled.  I did not have corn in the house - we eat very little or no starch - so diced a zucchini and sauteed it with the veggies and it worked perfectly.  Also, the recipe makes about 8 servings, not 12, unless you are serving it in small portions or as a side dish.  We ate it as a one dish meal with a little brown rice underneath, and in this case, it was 8 normal portions, not big man-sized ones.  The time allocated is fairly accurate, maybe a little optimistic for the first time unless you're a ginzu chopper!",
