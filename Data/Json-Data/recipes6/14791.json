Be careful not to over-mix the meringue or fold the batter too much or you'll let out all the air and ruin your macarons! Another important step is to let the macarons sit for 20 minutes or longer to let the batter harden creating the shell.",

Fast forward over 5 years later and I know they aren't now, this is an Italian cookie.  My daughter still likes turning theses into macarons though by adding frosting. For the recipe, be careful not to over or under whip your eggs. Use a large ziploc bag or piping bag to pipe into circles on a parchment lined sheet for uniform cookies. I bake mine closer to 30 minutes for a crisper cookie with a nice chewiness.  They turn out better on drier days.",
