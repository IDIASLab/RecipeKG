I cooked it on low for about 10 minutes then boiled for 2 minutes.  Then take it off heat and keep beating it while it cools.  I beat it by hand for a minute then let it cool for a couple more then beat it again and so on until it was really thick and creamy.  It's best not to use it until it's nearly completely cooled.  My husband LOVED it.  He said it reminded him of the chocolate icing on bakery donuts.  ",
