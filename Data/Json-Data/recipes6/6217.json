I followed it more closely than I normally do with recipes but I did make a couple of minor adjustments...I more than doubled the amount of (spicy) curry powder because we like strong flavors substituted extra virgin olive oil for the butter (next time I might try coconut oil instead to add a hint of sweetness) and I cooked the rice and pea mixture on the stovetop and broiled the tilapia fillets with the almonds on the top rack of my oven. Other than that I followed it exactly and was extremely happy with how it turned out...even my picky(ish) seven year old ate a whole plate of it!",

Then I added 2 cups of unsalted chicken stock and a whole tablespoon of curry powder. No salt! Brought to a boil, added 1 cup white rice, placed my cut up cod fillets on top and then simmered on low with lid for 20 minutes. After 20, I removed from heat and let it continue to steam without lifting lid for another 10. Folded in 1 cup canned drained peas while fluffing the rice, and added 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (a low sodium soy substitute). served with unsalted dry roasted peanuts. DELICIOUS!",
