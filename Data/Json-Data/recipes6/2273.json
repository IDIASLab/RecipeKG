This was perfect!  I made a few changes, but nothing major.  Added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, used 7 eggs and about 2 cups milk, used somewhat more than 1/3 cup dark brown sugar.  Added about 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring, added a couple of pinches of salt, and used 4 sliced, very-ripe bananas.  Also did not melt butter; simply cubed it and scattered the cubes.  I layered half the bread, bananas,  nuts & butter in pan, then repeated layers.  Whisked together eggs, milk, vanilla, rum flavoring, brown sugar & spices, and poured evenly over bread layers.  Waited about 15 minutes, then baked at 350 degrees for an hour.  Served with syrup--to RAVE reviews from hubby and visiting adult stepdaughter.  :-)  Definitely will be making again!  Yum... excellent!",

This will prevent the sogginess others have complained about.  The liquid needs something to absorb into, which is harder with fresh sandwich bread.  Next - I mashed the bananas into the egg mixture - there were still bits of banana but not big chucks. My kids preferred this.  I will definitely make this again and highly recommend to others.
