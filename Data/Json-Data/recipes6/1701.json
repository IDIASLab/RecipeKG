Overall good recipe but I will go back to using golden raisins to suit our taste. Also 10 minutes was a little too much time as it overcooked the pastry shells. Perhaps our oven is a little hotter than most; keep an eye on your tarts.",

Firstly more direction needed on the pastry. I wanted to tackle this as a first-timer challenge. My later tarts to which I added more water than was called for worked out much better. The dough needs to be faintly tacky to be truly flexible and go down in your cups without cracking. Second the filling is a tch dry. I would like a gooey-er tart. More cream? Bears investigating!",
