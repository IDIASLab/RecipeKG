                "reviewBody": "As written, this recipe would warrant a 2-star rating.  But with some changes, it could well be 5-star!\n\nAs others, I also added crushed garlic (1 large clove), and a few dashes each of soy and worcestershire sauce.  Without these flavor enhancers, the recipe would be quite flat.  I also reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup; fearing that 1 1/2 cups would be way overkill.  1/2 cup was perfect, and I used the lite version with success. Once the sour cream and flour mixture was added to the mushroom and broth mixture, I cooked everything on med/low heat for about a minute to cook the flour a bit (raw flour is not a good thing).\n\nFor further improvement next time, I'd add a few teaspoons of tomato paste to ramp up the flavor and richness of the dish (tomato paste is sometimes found in beef stroganoff recipes).  Also, unless you're a strict vegetarian, I would recommend using beef broth in place of the vegetable broth.  Lastly, I would reconstitute a few dried mushrooms (ex:  dried porcinis) and add them into the mix.  This would pump up the 'mushroomy-ness' of the dish.  For texture variety, you could also add in some other types of fresh mushrooms (button, oyster, etc.)\n\nLastly, don't cook your noodles before starting to prepare the stroganoff.  They will get cold and sticky by the time you're ready to use them.  Instead, cook 'em at the last minute.\n\nOnce served up on your dinner plate, add a dollop of sour cream to the top of the stroganoff.  Yum!",

I cooked the onion and mushrooms with one minced garlic clove. When the mushrooms and sour cream mixture were on low on the stove, I added: 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce, and a dash of white wine. I used a lot less parsley - just threw some in and then decided it looked good. The recipe was really tasty. I loved it - finally I've found a vegetarian equivalent to my Mom's beef recipe! My 17-year-old cousin said that she isn't usually a huge fan of vegetarian dishes, but she really loved this one. I'll definitely make it again! Great for company, although I'd definitely double the recipe, because it was not a lot.",

I made some substitutions to make this recipe dairy-free: vegan margarine and Tofutti Sour Supreme. I didn't have all-purpose flour so I used whole wheat which was awesome surprisingly not grainy at all. I added a dash of soy sauce as others recommended and I served it atop rice instead of egg noodles. I'm looking forward to making this again!

I used a mix of Portobello Shitake and Oyster mushrooms and about 3/4 cup of Fat Free sour cream (mixed with about 2 Tbsp whole wheat flour). Mixed some red onion with Walla Walla sweet onion. I put this over whole wheat rotini with good results. The second time I followed my own suggestions:-)using used homemade chicken stock (needed to get it out of the freezer) and whole wheat fettuccine. This time I used Light sour cream and mixed onion with diced shallots. Once again it was really good. BTW consider on your time constraints...I like cooking the pasta of any dish late in the cooking process. Seems it mixes w/ sauces etc better when it's hot out of the colander. It wants to keep cooking when put in a hot sauce...so keep that in mind under cook it by a minute. If sauce is coming out of the fridge...feel free to cool the pasta by adding it to the cool sauce (cook pasta for full length of recommended time in this case.",
