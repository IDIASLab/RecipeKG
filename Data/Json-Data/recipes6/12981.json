This was also his first paid 'catering' job for a graduation party when he was 12 (he's married now, so that gives you a clue as to how long I've had this recipe). Great brownies with a mint flavored filling.",

The first time I made these at Christmas I did it from scratch but the next time instead of all the effort I baked a batch of boxed brownies and still did the topping the same. We liked it better!

The one I use is Betty Crocker Triple Chunk-- by far the best brownie mix I've found out there. The minty frosting with the chocolate on top is a nice addition and dresses it up a bit so that you can serve it on a dessert tray at a fancier party. I tried to \"drizzle\" the chocolate over the mint frosting but it didn't drizzle very well for me so I ended up spreading it. Chill it well so that it cuts with sharp edges making presentation even nicer.",

The brownie part itself probably wouldn't be great by itself (I have another recipe that's out of this world) but with the mint frosting and chocolate on top it was really just right. I made a half batch and it worked out fine. I didn't want to buy creme de menthe just for this so I used a splash of mint extract in the frosting along with some green food coloring. I also wasn't very patient and frosted these while still kind of warm and then put the top chocolate layer on. However they cooled nicely and came out of the pan beautifully. I can't wait to make them again. I think they've got a great balance of flavors. Not too overly sweet not too minty. Might try the creme de menthe another time.",
