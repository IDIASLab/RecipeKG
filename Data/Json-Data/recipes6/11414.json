It was more like a crumble mixture, and I literally had to press it into the pan with my hand.  But, to my surprise, it was fantastic!  Everyone loved it, as it was quite different with a very cruchy crust and soft and almost toffee like middle.  Forget the frosting, it doesn't need it.  Lovely cold but extra special served warm as a desert, with whipped cream and dusted with powdered sugar.",
