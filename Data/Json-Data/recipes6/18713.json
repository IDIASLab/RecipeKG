I placed the starter in the freezer for later and forgot about it. When I moved I ended up throwing it away. Recently I began thinking about the cake but I couldn't remember the name of it and I didn't have the starter. One day I went to Allrecipes and put cake starter in the search and up popped your cake starter. Thank you soooo much. I'm starting the starter this weekend and my cake 21 days after that.",
