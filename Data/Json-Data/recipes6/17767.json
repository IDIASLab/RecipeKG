Splenda 1 tbsp. molasses for brown and white sugar 4 egg whites instead of just 2 (to add more liquids because the Splenda has a tendency to absorb some of the moistness in baking mixes) I also didn't include any raisins or chocolate like some reviewers did. These subs need to be mixed differently because of the consistencies; which i did as follows: I beat the bananas and crisco until well blended; then I added the molasses and vanilla again beating until well blended; then I beat the egg whites in until well blended; then I added the Splenda 1/2 c. at a time beating well after each addition. Then mixed dry ingredients per the recipe. You also need to smash them down with fork on cookie sheet. The end result: delicious!",
