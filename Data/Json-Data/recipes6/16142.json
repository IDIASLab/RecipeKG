Once it was a little over a cup once a little under and both times it turned out fine. I grate the apple with the skin still on and you don't really notice it. My only very slight complaint is that I usually make double recipes of pancakes and freeze the extra so I can just pop them in the toaster in the morning for a quick breakfast for my toddlers. Well for some reason these don't taste very good reheated. Oh well it's worth making fresh whenever we need some apple pancakes! Thanks for the yummy recipe!",

To make this recipe a bit healthier for my kids I substitute whole wheat flour for about half of the all-purpose flour and substitute honey for the sugar.

My kids actually prefer this recipe with the whole wheat flour - it gives the pancakes a wonderful nutty flavor that really compliments the apples and cinnamon well.  I usually double this recipe and it's the perfect amount for my family of six. Thanks for the great recipe!",
