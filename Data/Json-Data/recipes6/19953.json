Once I realized I had forgotten the sugar I asked him if he wanted me to add some and he didn't so apparently the sugar isn't really necessary for this to taste good. It looks really cool when you pour it into the glass because it's so thick it kind of piles on the top like a thick malt! Pineapple-orange juice was not on hand but orange juice was so that's what I used. This is an excellent way to get your calcium (and the active cultures) and vitamins - when I make these for Hubs I feel like I've done something good and healthy for him for breakfast that he probably woudn't do on his own.",
