My fiance and I didn't eat all of it as I doubled the recipe BUT it gave me a nice base to actually make a nice chilli the next day so I can say it's super versatile and if you tweak it I think it's actually a decent recipe!!",

The only change I made was to reduce the apple cider vinegar by about half because I didn\u2019t want it to be overpowering for them. It still has the tartness, but without being overwhelming for young, picky eaters. Thanks for sharing!",
