Serve this warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream and it is very similar to a gooey brownie sundae. I've never seen it result in dumplings precisely. It usually looks more like a cake with wonderful chocolate syrup underneath that you can drizzle over the ice cream. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.",
