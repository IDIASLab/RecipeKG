Cool nuts completely before chopping and adding to recipe.  (You can speed up the cooling process by immediately placing hot, toasted nuts onto a plate and place in the freezer for 5 to 8 minutes.

This is NOT the one. I followed the recipe (everything except the unbleached flour-I used regular flour) shook the hands-the whole bit! I'll have to say they were very pretty cookies but entirely to cake-like (maybe it was the baking powder-never put baking powder in my cookies before). They had almost no taste (the true test of a good choc chip cookie is if the cookie part can stand on it's own without the chips). But the worst part was the kosher salt. I kept biting into chunks of salt. Stacy I appreciate the amount of time that went into perfecting your recipe but I'll have to keep looking. Thanks anyway!",

This is the first time that I was able to get a cookie that looked like a bakery cookie, and didn't flatten out, even though I did not have to chill the dough. It's an easy cookie to make. Wetting hands just made it easier to roll and look pretty; it's not a must. I'm surprised at some reviewers thinking it was so difficult to wet their hands, or that dark corn syrup is such an exotic ingredient. I guess they don't bake very much. Also, I don't like the taste of baked nuts, so I left them out and used extra chips. Loved them! I overbaked one batch till they were all golden, and that was wonderful also. Chewy cookies, not dry. Thank you so very much for this recipe, Stacey. I am indebted to you.",

I tried it out for a friend who craved big chewy chocolate chip cookies and he freaked. I've been making them ever since. A few tricks I've learned with this recipe: use an ice cream scoop to dump the dough onto the sheet. The cookies are enormous but they definitely retain their chewiness and moist texture(use the baking time listed in the recipe). The ice cream scoop yields 3-4\" wide cookies that are at least 3/4\" thick. to avoid the salt chunks that can happen with kosher salt I let my KitchenAid have at the dough (before adding the chips) for a good long time. I find that I can taste the salt chunks when I rush this step. I add 2 tsp. or so of cocoa powder or even cinnamon to the flour mixture. It gives the dough a little kick and helps it stand up to the chips. if you're out of half and half I've used regular milk and it works fine as a substitute.",

I'm a very serious baker who has been frustrated at the quality of the chocolate chip cookies I've been baking in the past. I don't like the Toll House recipe. I've been fiddling with it for years to no avail. I always end up with either very dry cookies or \"pancake\" cookies with little chocolate chip \"bumps\". They also fall apart very easily. The decreased butter and the addition of corn syrup in your recipe did the trick. The baking time is critical. Too little and they're a little raw too much and they become a bit dry. I've determined the correct length of time for my oven and the cookies are WONDERFUL!",
