Chocolate chip cookie dough with a hint of strawberry! The recipe is a good recipe for a snack it ended up a bit thinner than I like I added more flour and it was better. If I had refrigerated the cookie dough for a while it probably would have thickened up similar to most cookie doughs... But being realistic it's cookie dough made to eat there is no way I can sit patiently for an hour knowing I could be eating it! To help cut down on the grittiness of the sugar try not mixing the flour in until everything else has been mixed together.",
