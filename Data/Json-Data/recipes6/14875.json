This was pretty close to what I used but not quite the same. I didn't have enough oil for the recipe and the amount indicated seemed like a ton so I substituted half for applesauce. I had just recently watched a cooking show where the pastry chef recommended mixing cake batter with a whisk instead of an automatic mixer. She said the mixer made the batter tough. I tried the whisk and it was easy and really did seem to improve the batter. It turned out really really good. Moist with a fantastic consistency. Excellent recipe!",
