This was my first time making doughnuts and 'yeast' ones are supposed to be harder to make but by using the dough cycle on my bread machine these were a snap!! I had trouble rolling them out the first time & had to re-roll them which made me worried they would come out tough but they were fantastic! Just the right amount of crispy on the outside to chewy on the inside... these will become a family tradition!! Thank you!!!",

It freed up time do do other holiday things. and   We used orange marmalade one day and loquat jelly the next day.  Tomorrow, poppy seed or almond cream!!\r\nThank you to the person who submitted this one!!!!",

This was my first time making this style of doughnut so perhaps with practice i would not be so messy. My 5 kids thought they were delicious but maybe should be sweeter. I used jam and wished I had a can of pastry filling instead on hand. That would have held up better in the doughnut and made less of a mess. So 4 stars for the recipe and 3 for me LOL -",
