To pep it up a little I also add about 1/4 tsp of tabasco sauce to the dough with the 2nd half of the liquid mixture.  I also really like this with very course chopped jalapenos as well as with extra sharp cheese, cut into little cubes (about a 1/4 inch or so).  It makes cheese pockets.  Oh, and I like to shape this into a long loaf, brush with egg white and a little water and bake on a greased cookie sheet.  The crust is wonderful! ",

We halved the recipe and used bread flour a few sliced pickled jalapenos (and the carrots it came with) and chunks from a whole 8 oz cheddar cheese block. In lieu of the 1 cup of hot water we mixed a 1/4 cup of the liquid from the jalapeno pickle can with 3/4 cup of warm milk (skim). We also added one egg. The bread turned out fantastic and had the perfect kick! Next time we will probably try to add a little more cheese but this recipe was easy to follow and personalize! Thanks for sharing!",

I couldn't wait to try it since I have an over abundancy of Jalapenos. I followed the recipe but I used \"hot\" water & it didn't rise at all. After failing twice w/ the recipe I got on the web & checked out the ratings. I also saw where someone else made it w/ no luck in the bread rising. Next time I will use warm water instead. Hopefully that will take care of the problem. MY SECOND REVIEW: There are NOT enough stars on here for this one. It turned out absolutly wonderful the third time (3X's a charm I guess). I used \"WARM\" water this time instead of \"HOT\" & what a difference it made. It rised!!!!!! Anyone thinking of making this wonderful bread please do it is very tasty w/ just the right \"SPICE\".",
