Feel free to put this on chicken, pork, or just about anything else you can think of. To cover a typical 5-pound chicken, I normally measured the spices in tablespoons. However, feel free to mix a larger batch to keep some finished product on hand. One thing's for sure, you will be the hit of the party!",

I used the whole batch on one, big, Amish chicken.  I rubbed the outside generously and sprinkled a bunch more into the cavity.  In addition (thanks to watching cooking shows on TV), I took 2 TBS of Olive Oil and squeezed a lemon into the oil and drizzled that over the top to get the skin crispy, brown and spicy).  As a side note, don't throw the juiced lemons out, toss them into the cavity to bake some of that lemony flavor into the chicken.  It was fabulous!  When it was all over, I took the drippings and brought it to a boil on the stovetop adding in 2 TBS of Wondra Sauce & Gravy Flour to make a sweet, spicy gravy that was great over our stuffing and for dipping the chicken too.  Served with Green Beans with Almonds and Carmelized Shallots, this was a 5 star dinner!!!  Thanks to Ed for inventing such a nifty rub!",

I did a beer can chicken, and since the spice rub reminded me of Mexico, I made a Mexican rice along side with the leftover spice rub. It was a perfect combo! The only difference I did was use onion powder since I didn't have the granulated onion. I will definitely use this again and again, thanks!",
