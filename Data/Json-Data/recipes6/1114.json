        "description": "I love brined turkey. This is a lovely sweet and savory turkey great for Thanksgiving. Cook time and serving size will vary depending on the size of your turkey. The brine is made the same way regardless of the size of your turkey.  Only the cook time and amount of filling will vary. You will need a cooler or clean, food safe bucket large enough to hold your bird as well as lots of icy water. I use a cooler so my directions will be written for a cooler. If you use some sort of bucket just use your judgment to match the directions. You can customize the brine using fresh herbs, seasonings, fruits, and vegetables you prefer.",

Bottom line is if your turkey was too salty you most likely did not rinse the bird or did not rinse it enough. If you rinse it well after the brining you will not have the over saltiness. You also do not need to add salt in the seasonings when cooking which also would cause the issue you mention. Try again with these things in mind. Happy Brining!",
