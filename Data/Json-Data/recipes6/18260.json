I used bacon pieces instead of strips, apple cider vinegar and Splenda instead of sugar (Splenda is somewhat sweeter than suger so be careful).  I also threw in a vegetable bouillon cube and used less salt; instead of pouring salt on all layer, I salted 2 of 4 layers.  I don't think you need as much flour as the recipe calls for; next time, I'll use half.  Also, I could have thrown in another head of cabbage after the first head boiled down to even out the juice.  Even though there are some things that I would do differently next time, this was still the best cabbage I've made and I've made a lot of cabbage!  You can not go wrong with following the recipe verbatim.",

I did make one mistake by using salt instead of the caraway seeds in the layering process. I did mix in a bunch of caraway seeds when I realized my error, and luckily the dish didn't turn out salty. I omitted the bacon just because I felt it wouldn't add all that much to the dish other than fat. The amount of sugar and vinegar in the recipe was just right to achieve the sweet-sour ratio. Another great way to make cabbage!",
