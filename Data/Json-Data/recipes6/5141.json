You can literally throw everything in it and leave it all day so you have a lovely wholesome meal waiting for you at dinner time.

I followed the recipe almost EXACTLY only adding 1 extra ingredient -- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro at the end (last 15 minutes). I started with frozen chicken breasts and cooked it for 4 hours on high setting in my crockpot. The chicken was not overdone. I like spicy and I found the seasoning as written to be perfect. Be sure to add 1 tsp. black pepper (don't just give it a shake) -- gives it a nice heat without being overpowering. Use a good quality curry powder. Since I added my chicken breasts frozen I started them in the broth while sauteing the onion and garlic. Heated the canned tomatoes in the microwave before adding to crockpot to speed up the cooking. I diced the sweet potatoes about 1/2 inch dice. Everything was done to perfection in 4 hours (at high). Will definitely make this again.",
