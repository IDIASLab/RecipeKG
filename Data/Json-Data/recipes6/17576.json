To stop the cake from cracking while cooking, leave cake in oven after turning off the heat, leave oven door ajar. Ten minutes later, run a thin bladed knife around the edge to release the cake from the pan, put back in oven and let cool until oven is cold. Take out of oven and let cake cool completely to room temperature before placing in cooler or fridge.\r\nI have used this method for many years professionally and found that it works every time. The main trick is not to overcook the cake, cook only until the centre is \"jiggely\" not firm. It will firm up as it cools.",

I added lemon extract, lemon juice and lemon zest. I served it with ras puree. I also left out all the spices for the crust. Another time I made it I used sugar cookies for the crust. That was wonderful! As far as cracks go..LEAVE int he over for a couple hours after you turn the oven off. I never get cracks and I always follow that rule. Also, I had the oven on 340 and only cooked it with the oven on for 30 min. Left it in the oven for another 2 hours. It will continue to cook in the heat just don't open the door! Great recipie!",

Literally, once it was done, we went to a Christmas celebration and I didn't take it out until we got home(2 hours later)- no cracks!! I also didn't over mix the filling.  I used our mixer on the lowest setting the entire time. The crust is okay.  I agree with another review that stated it's kinda a distraction from tasting the flavor of the cheesecake. Next time I'll use a basic graham cracker crust.  I also looked into it browning on the top.  I found an article about the baking temp. Apparently cheesecakes should be baked at 250-300 degrees.  Next time I will bake it at 300 degrees for about 80-90 minutes.\n\nEdit:  I just made this for Christmas yesterday.  I baked it at 300 degrees for about 80 minutes, and I had NO brown top!!  I left if in the oven to cool for 30 minutes, then cracked the door and left it in for another 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  NO cracks, and I didn't go through the trouble of using a water bath.",

I use 1 1/2 cups almonds finely ground in the food processor for the crust and replace the sugar with 3 packets of Splenda.

Have yet to taste (still in oven) but smells heavenly. I normally dont use a waterbath but what I do to avoid cracks is place the springform pan on a very sturdy baking sheet when cooking and never open the oven door. You can easily watch it from using the light switch of course. When done turn off oven and leave it in there for an hour or leave door open ajar. Always refrigerate cheesecake for at least a day or more for optimum flavor before serving. Never use 'whipped' cream cheese always buy the 'block' cream cheese that should always be softened.",

The cheesecake filling was rich and extremely heavy (still waiting for it to digest). This recipe was very easy to follow although it made far too much cheesecake filling so I just made a second cheesecake to use up the extras. To avoid cracking make sure you do not overbeat your cheesecake mixture use a water bath whilst baking and bake at a lower temperature. After baking cool cheesecake in oven with door open once the oven has cooled down take cheesecake out to finish off cooling. Once cooled refrigerate overnight.",

I studied quite a few recipes before deciding on this one which I chose because of the additions significant ones at that of both heavy cream and sour cream. I m not a big fan of heavy dense dry cheesecakes and the smooth and creamy texture I anticipated was exactly what this delivered. Because a basic cheesecake with a fresh raspberry sauce was what I planned I used a standard chocolate wafer crust rather than the spiced up version directed in the recipe. This cheesecake couldn t have done me more proud. I baked it in a water bath and even tho it appears condensation caused some water seepage I don t know how a cheesecake could have turned out any better. I admit I was a little nervous about the rather large amounts of sour cream and heavy cream but after making serving and eating this cheesecake myself I m convinced it IS the large amounts of sour cream and heavy cream that made this cheesecake such a hit so extraordinarily delicious.",
