First of all because these brownies are non-dairy my grandson can enjoy them along with the rest of the family. This recipe bakes up into moist and flavorful dark fudge brownies. I made two pans one for work and one for my granddaughter's birthday party and these were enjoyed by all. At the party I literally had people wrapping them up to take home before they were all gone from the pan. My son-in-law raved about these the next day and said that they have a great \"edginess\" to them. I think they have a very \"sophisticated\" chocolate flavor to them. The only change I made was to add one cup of frozen Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chips to the batter just before baking. I do agree with some other reviewers the bake time should be lessened because even with the addition of the bittersweet chips and the use of two jumbo eggs I only needed to bake these for 30 minutes. (As a general rule brownies should only be baked until they just begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. I rely on this more than stated baking times as a way to avoid over-dry brownies.) Trish thank you for a truly wonderful recipe that will now be my standard go-to for brownies!! Excellent recipe!!",

I would say they are a good in between brownie--about an inch thick in a 9x13 pan. They are so easy to make. I added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa (I used a blend of natural and dutch-processed cocoa); I also added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and two teaspoons of espresso powder. My husband isn't big on chocolate or sweets but he really likes these because they aren't too sweet. thanks for the easy and very tasty recipe!",

They were dry and cracked on top and when I tried to slice them into pretty squares after they were cool to take to a family function the top cracked and the brownies fell apart into big chunks as I tried to slice them. I added more cocoa this time for more chocolate flavor and I didn't cook them as long as before so they were very fudgy and chocolately this time. If you want chunks to eat by hand or toss onto some ice cream they are absolutely delicious this way. But I never could slice them into nice squares; they just fell apart into pieces. I will make this recipe again but not to take to work or family get togethers as I can't get them to slice into nice pretty squares even after cooling. The tops are a thin hard layer that crack when you try to slice underneath the brownie falls into pieces as you try to cut them. But overall very good brownie to eat.",
