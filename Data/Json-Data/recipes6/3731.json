I cooked it on high pressure for 10 minutes did a quick release on the pressure. Then added the remaining ingredients. Cooked for an additional 5 minutes on high pressure. The cooking method was the only thing changed which I don t believe compromised the outcome. I was expecting this to be more flavorful but was disappointed as it was lacking in flavor. I think it needs some garlic and some more pop of color.",
