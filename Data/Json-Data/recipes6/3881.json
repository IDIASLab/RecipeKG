I like the fact that the cake is not overly sweet, but I think I might like the flavor better to add ground cinnamon, instead of apple pie spice.  With the chocolate, there seemed to be too many competing flavors.  The recipe makes a LOT of glaze, and I think 1 cup powdered sugar and adjusting from there would be ample glaze.  I chose to omit the spice from the glaze.  Instead, I added a pinch of salt and a little vanilla extract.",
