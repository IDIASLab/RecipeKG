Because this recipe uses melted Kisses which are milk chocolate the cookies end up being rich and chewy. The cashews were a definite plus. You don't see too many cookies around with cashews in them so the overall flavor was different than your average nut-cookie. Be careful not to under-bake them; being chocolate it can be a bit difficult to see when they're done. They come out of the oven a little bit flimsy but they firm up as they cool.",

The only change I made was to halve the nuts (in this case 1 C of nuts instead of 2) since hubby dislikes heavy quantities of nuts in food. These were okay but we didn't love them. Not quite sweet enough moist enough chocolately enough or orangey enough. My friend said she would have preferred the plain chocolate over the cookies.",
