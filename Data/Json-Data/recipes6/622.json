I baked it in a tube pan for only 50 minutes. I also used a mixer instead of only hand mixing. I added a brandy glaze made with sugar butter half and half and brandy and I sprinkled sugar crystals on it. It was moist and delicious. I took it to a gathering and everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe as written except I cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2c and it was just sweet enough for my tastes cause I like tartness. I used a handheld mixer to mix it all up. The batter might not seem like it will cover all the fruit but it bakes up beautifully. I cooled it for 15 minutes in the pan on a rack then turned it out to finish cooling. You could easily substitute other fruit or use all one type of fruit. Would easily accept other spice combinations as well. I might try pears and ginger next time.",

You will NEVER have a problem getting the cake to fall right out of the pan if you do this! Just let the cake cool 30 mins before turning out onto a platter.**** Also note that the batter will be very stiff when stirring the fruit and nuts in. A thin coating of oil on a big sturdy spoon makes the stirring much easier. The finished batter will look like more fruit than batter but it turns out perfectly every time. Don't skimp on the apples, either, or your cake will be dry. I use slightly mounded cups when measuring the apple pieces. Don't overdo the fruit either, otherwise the cake can be too moist.\nThe ingredient proportions are perfect as is, the cake is sweet, and icing is unnecessary. Powdered sugar is a must, and looks beautiful on top.",
