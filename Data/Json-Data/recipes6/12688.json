Once it comes to a boil, take it off of the heat (the peanut butter still mixes nicely). My nephew said this is better than a Butterfinger. I might like a little more cornflake in it - I will use more cornflakes next time to test. Fun, easy, and good.",

I was worried that they would taste 'cornflakey ' but they are just totally peanut buttery. I put a little more chocolate on the top than called for to use what I had. You'll want to cut them smallish as they are very rich and sweet - and addictive. Thanks for the recipe!:)",
