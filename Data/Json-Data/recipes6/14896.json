I use yeast from a jar instead of packets, and I used 2.5 teaspoons. After it got foamy (I only waited about 10 minutes...I'm impatient) I mixed in the salt, butter and egg, then I started mixing the flour a half cup at a time.  I let it rise for about 45 minutes in the bowl, then punched it down, divided it into 16 balls (I didn't feel like making crescents) and let it rise for another hour, then baked for 10 minutes. They turned out like something from a bakery. I have never, ever baked bread this wonderful. I am so bummed that I am home alone right now and nobody can see what a wonderful thing I just did!\r\nI also want to add, pay attention to the temperature of your oven...My oven tends to be extremely hot, so I only set it for 350 to bake these...they turned out perfect. I know 400 degrees would have blackened them.\r\n~K",

Allow to rise for 45mins in a warm area, covered with clean dish towel. Turn out and continue with step 2. These are very light, tasty rolls!!",

I used the all purpose flour as it called for, but I used the bread machine yeast...it was all I had. I used 2 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast. They rose just fine and taste great.  I will use this recipe to replace my old bread machine roll recipe.  As did another reviewer, I cut my dough into 36 pieces and placed three balls of dough into each muffin cup.  They turned into beautiful clover rolls.  Nice touch.  Also, I use a pizza cutter to cut my dough.",

It was so easy using my bread machine on dough cycle; then pulled the dough out and rolled out flat for cinnamon rolls. Added fresh orange peel and 2 Tb fresh orange juice to butter, spread it on the rectangle of dough; packed on lots of brown sugar and cinnamon. Rolled and cut into cinn. rolls. Baked in 9x13 pan, 20mins at 200 degrees, then 20+/- mins at 350 degrees. Might want to put foil loosely over top so they don't get too brown or dried out. Wonderful new tradition for Thanksgiving morning!!!!!",
