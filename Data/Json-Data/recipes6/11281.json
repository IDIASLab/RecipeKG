The only suggestion I have about this recipe if you are making it for the first time follow the instructions exactly! That includes the baking time. Do not bake any longer than the suggested time otherwise it could come out too dry. And yes you can change the extracts to the flavors you like but it's already perfect the way it is. I've made this cake several times now and I love it more and more each time. My co-workers love it too!",

So I found this recipe to make the cake from scratch. I used oil instead of shortening and I didn't have any problem with the cake sticking. I also doubled the glaze and added 8 tablespoons of butter to it. I always find that glazed cakes don't seem to absorb the glaze very well and end up sitting in a pool of it. So after turning the cake out of the pan I let it cool completely. Then I put the cake back in the pan and punched big holes in the bottom of it with a chopstick. I spooned about 2/3 of the glaze over the perferated cake bottom let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the glaze then inverted the cake onto a cake plate. I poked some smaller holes in the top of the cake with a skewer and brushed the remaining glaze on with a pastry brush. The glaze ended up perfectly saturating the cake and we just loved it. I'm never going back to a cake mix again! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
