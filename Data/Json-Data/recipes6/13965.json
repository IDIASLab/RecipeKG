I made the marinade as per the instructions except used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and green onions instead of regular. Sliced the pork to 1/2\" thick slices and laid out slightly overlapping in square baking dish. Marinated it overnight then drained off marinade into saucepan. Baked as per instructions. In the meantime made brown rice and added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies the last 5 minutes of cooking. Spread rice/veggies on plate and laid slices of pork over top. Served with boiled marinade in small condiment dishes on the side. Superb!",
