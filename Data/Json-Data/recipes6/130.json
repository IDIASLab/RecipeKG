I did make a couple of changes, as some ingredients are not available here in the heartland of Mexico.  I used Thai garlic chili sauce for the hot sauce and white wine vinegar instead of rice wine.  Also accidentally forgot the honey, but it was a perfect  mix of sweet and acid for our taste.  I will definitely make again and will use the glaze for other meats as well.",

The boiling really sealed in a soft, seasoned texture. The glaze was delicious, my husband raved about it! I lessoned the sugar by the half teaspoon, and didn't have rice vinegar or the 5 spice, or the chili paste! However, I substituted the vinegar with red cooking wine and chili paste with ketchup and chili pepper. I also used some creol spice instead of the chinese spice ( only used about a half of tspn since it has salt in it). I did have to make a little extra sauce (I had bigger rib pieces then what the recipe calls for) to completely cover all my ribs. When I went to glaze again halfway through baking in the oven , I just mixed more in a bowl with the same ingredients for the glaze. Maybe next time I make it I will have all the right ingredients but it still tasted so yummy!  Thank you for sharing this.",
