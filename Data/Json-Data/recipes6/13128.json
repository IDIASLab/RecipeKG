I would probably add a bit more flour to the recipe as when I went to roll it the dough was still really gooey and soft. Also DO NOT use the baking directions. It calls for 375 for 12-15 minutes so my first batch I set a timer for 11 minutes because I would rather have undercooked cookies than burnt... the first tray was a medium brown all around nothing like the photo so I watched my second tray and found that for a cookie that is soft and just nearly golden brown on the edges 7 minutes is all that is required. With those few small changes these cookies came out great but be prepared for a huge batch if you do not cut the recipe.",
