The cake was quickly gone, even though others brought desserts, too.  Also, there are three lunch shifts, and the cake was gone during the first shift, I think.  Some people who didn't get to try it were dissapointed.  I even had someone say, months after that potluck, that it was the best cake they'd ever ate.  Next time I make it, I want to decorate the top with cute and easy oreo penguins.  Just lay the oreo flat, twist off the top cookie, and break it into two pieces.  The two pieces form the wings as you lay the two pieces on top of the cream.  Then, just plop a hershey's kiss above the broken oreo.  Finaly, decorate the kiss face of the penguin.",

It said to add 1 1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup oil, 3 egg whites, and 1 cup coarsely crushed Oreo cookies to a white cake mix.  Stir in the cookies gently after all is blended.  The frosting recipe was different, however.  It was 3 cups of powdered sugar, 3/4 cup shortening, 1 teas. vanilla, and 2 egg whites (pasteurized, today, available in the egg section of the store). Combine 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar, shortening, vanilla and 2 egg whites; blend well. Beat in remaining powdered sugar until frosting is smooth and creamy.Garnish with additional Oreo cookie halves.  This frosting makes it easier to make ahead, take to a potluck, or to someone's house  It has always been a winner! (As soon as I saw this recipe I remembered that I had this version in my recipe box from many years ago.)",
