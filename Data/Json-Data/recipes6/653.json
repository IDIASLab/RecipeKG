My mother has celiac disease so I was looking for a nice dessert to make for our Thanksgiving dinner. She's not a big pumpkin pie fan but I'm convinced it's because she hasn't found the right one yet....I think I hit it with this recipe. She (and everyone else who tried it) absolutely loved it. Without the crust, it seems like a much lighter yet rich dessert. Will absolutely make again! This is a keeper. I changed absolutely nothing. Thank you for a wonderful alternative to the traditional pie.",
