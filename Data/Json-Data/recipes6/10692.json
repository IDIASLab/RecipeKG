I made a few substitutions with great results: I used pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg 1/3 white sugar & 2/3 light brown half oil & half applesauce and used baked sweet potatoes: bake on parchment because they're messy! Prick potatoes bake about 1hr 40min at 350F. The flesh pretty much pulls away from the skin - put the flesh in a bowl and give it a quick stir with a wisk and it's ready to go. I baked mine in mini-loaf pans (about 5-1/2\" x 3-1/2\" x 2\") - this recipe makes 4 loaves at about 1 generous cup batter per loaf - for 50 minutes. Perfect! These will be holiday gifts for sure (and plenty for us too!). For a zippy version I might try dried cranberries in place of the raisins.",

Used 1/2 cup wheat flour for part of the flour measure; 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 c. sugar; egg beaters for the eggs and walnuts instead of pecans. Since I cooked several sweet potatoes in the fall I measured out 1 cup servings and froze to enjoy this bread any time of the year. Remember using Splenda will cut down the baking time somewhat.",

Either way the bread itself is really top notch; what you add to it is just icing on the cake, so to speak.  Fabulous recipe; will be one of our family's favories I'm sure.",

The next (& 3rd) time I make this I'll reduce oil by 2 Tbsp. as I was able to detect oiliness in the original recipe. I'll also line the loaf pan with buttered wax paper as I had the 1st time I made this for ease of removal. Even if you bake this in a glass (Pyrex) loaf pan do keep to original suggested temperature instead of lowering temp. by 25 degrees as some advise when baking in glass.",
