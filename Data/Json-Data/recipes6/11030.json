I drained it and saved the left over rum which had turned a wine color and it was syrupy. I didn't have canned pineapple so I used some of the rum to compensate for moisture. I also used fresh squeezed orange juice so I added the zest of the oranges I used to the batter. I made a bunch of mini cakes to give away for Christmas. Even people who don't really like fruitcakes wanted me to bake them another one! I will definitely keep using this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing!",
