The sauce seemed a little bland so I added more hot sauce a splash of cider vinegar a dash of taco seasoning (I already had it out for another recipe) and some cumin. It was a hit!:) A tip for de kerneling the cob: use a large bowl and a small bowl. Turn the small bowl upside down and put it inside the large bowl. Stand the ear of corn up on the upside down bowl and run your knife down along the edge of the cob. All of the kernels will fall into the bigger bowl instead of all over your counter.:)",
