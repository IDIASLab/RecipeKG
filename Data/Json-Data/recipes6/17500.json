I just made them and have not really had a chance to taste them but my suggestion for the peanut butter is to drop it by tablespoons all over top of the bars right out of the oven turn the oven off and stick them back in the oven for a couple of minutes so the peanut butter can melt a little thus making it really easy to spread!! I did have to take a little taste off the corner of the pan;-) and they tasted pretty darn good!! But like other viewers said very crumbly i had to use a spoon!! Over all a good and very very easy bar! Update I changed my review to 2 stars because we only ate about 1/4 of the pan. They tasted really good to begin with but they just weren't so awesome that we had to keep eating them. By the way we never ever let a desert or bars or anything sweet go to waste hahah we are a sweets family so the fact that we didn't eat hardly any of these should say something. sorry just not that good",
