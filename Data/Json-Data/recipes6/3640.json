I was concerned it might be too salty, but the chops were flavourful, moist and tender. The cooking time was perfect as well. The brown sugar caramelized the chops making the plate presentation appealing. I added a bit of mango salsa to the top of the chops which balanced the sweetness of the rub. Great recipe!",
