I used a combination of fresh and thawed frozen vegetables and added some onion.  I sauteed 1/4 of an onion in the skillet first with 1 teaspoon of garlic power.  Then I tossed in the veggies.  For the sauce I used only a small amount (approximately an 1/8 of a teaspoon) of garlic and I added some black pepper.  When I make this again tonight I'm going to add a small amount of spicy mustard to the sauce.  Though the sauce is good on it's own I personally think it could use a kick.  I also think adding water and cornstarch or flour to the sauce and letting it cook until thickened (rather than adding it before serving) would also add a little something too.\n\nThis is perfect pared with jasmine rice, tofu, and an egg roll!",

More peanut butter and more brown sugar, but only because I favor very sweet asian dishes and sauces. I also added stir fry beef as a protein. The actual ratios in the recipe would have been fine, too. One tip- when you add the frozen veggies there is some moisture that collects at the bottom of the pan. You can either drain that before adding the sauce for a more thickly coated stir fry, or you can leave it and have a more liquidy sauce that soaks nicely into some white rice! This is probably the easiest meal I've ever made. Really, it's easier than hamburger helper or even DRIVING to a restaurant! And for such a simple, affordable recipe that requires several ingredients that I almost always have on hand, its flavors were interesting and quite complex. I will be making this again, 100 times over. Delicious!!!",
