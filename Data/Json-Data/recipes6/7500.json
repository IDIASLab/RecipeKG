I used a trifle bowl instead of making individual servings to allow everyone to eat as much as they wanted. And though I used strong coffee (at least I thought so!) I should have made it stronger yet as the pound cake absorbs a lot of the coffee flavor thus making it fairly mild. I left out the chocolate as some family members are allergic to it. Recipe is sweet but I knew my family would be happy! As people left my house I was asked when I was going to make it again so they could come over!",
