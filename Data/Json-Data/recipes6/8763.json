The only deviations I made were I did not have fresh mint, so I used a dash of mint extract, I left out the applesauce, and forgot to freeze the strawberries (I threw them in the ice in the freezer while I prepped everything and they actually got a little frozen).  The mint really makes this!  It's a little \"frothy\" in consistency; I may add some ice next time. I'd considered adding a little Captain Morgan to make it a grown up smoothie, but decided not to w/the frothiness.  I added some frozen grapes at service and I liked their addition. ",
