I think a merengue frosting is necessary for this cake to be authentic--the merengue lightens the texture and is less sweet and rich than whipped cream (which is v. good also). So--the answer is to \"cook\" the merengue as in \"Italian merengues.\" To do this, you just heat to liquify a sugar syrup, sugar & water. Then you slowly pour this boiling syrup into the eggs whites while you are whipping them. This cooks the whites, but they still look like white, fluffy clouds.",

As a variation try coconut milk as one of the three milks and then garnish the cake with seasonal fresh fruit and toasted coconut. However what is really special about this recipe is the cake part. It is easy to make avoids butter fat grams and can be used in a number of different desserts like trifle or all by itself. The ingredients are staples in most kitchens so it can be made spur of the moment. Thank you.",
