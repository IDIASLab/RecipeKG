I simply replace the sugar with Splenda and the vanilla with banana extract a drop or two of yellow food coloring then pour the filling over sliced bananas in a sugar-free cookie crumb crust. Chill it and top it with sweetened whipped cream. My dad LOVES it and after tasting it my aunt asked for the recipe so she can make it for my uncle who is diabetic. If you know how to make a custard this recipe is practically fool-proof and HIGHLY adaptable. 5 stars!!",

There was a little snafu with the whipped cream - I think I used too much or whipped the cream too long. The pie was still one of the best I've ever had. This pie is super rich -- a total coconut luxury! It is also INCREDIBLY versatile! The brandy can be switched out for any flavoured liqueur and fruit would easily be used in place of coconut. I can't wait to try it again with strawberries - YUM! One thing I'll do differently: add more jam. I love jam and I'd like it to shine through a bit more. Happy baking friends!",

I did use a thermometer to make sure the mixtures were at the correct temperature. When I made it a second time I found that using a double boiler for the egg yolk mixture was easier to manage on the stove then poured it into a large bowl. The recipe does take some time of constant preparation but well worth the love and attention. Allow several hours or day before to set. It is delicious light and smooth will be my go-to dessert recipe. The recipe makes a lot more than will fit in a pie shell. I used the remainder by crumbling more of the base ingredients in the bottom of 3 stemless wine glasses spooning in the filling then topping with mandarin pieces and toasted coconut for an elegant dessert.",
