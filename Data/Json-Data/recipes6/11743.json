The ingredients should include instructions for tempering the eggs.  To those who had trouble with the ingredients separating: mix together all of the ingredients except for the eggs and pecans over medium heat until sugar is melted and cocoa is incorporate.  Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and while STILL beating, add about 1/2 cup slowly to the eggs to gradually increase the temperature.  Then add the egg mixture back to the saucepan still stirring.  Your mixture will thicken almost instantly, then you can add the pecans and pour the mixture into the pie shell.  It only takes an extra minute to do this, but the results are perfect every time!",

I didn't even have evaporated milk and used the sweetened (thick) condensed milk instead kept my fingers crossed the substitution would be okay and this turned out the creamiest richest chocolatiest pie ever. I didn't use an electric mixer just a wooden spoon. I paired this with french pastry pie crust and it is fabulous. 5 plus stars!!!!!",
