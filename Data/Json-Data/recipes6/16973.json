I waited another 40 minutes and tasted it again in a cooled state and the flavor was the same  eggy/oj flavors as before.\nI did not find it to overly sweet, but that maybe because I was overwhelmed by the other two negatively dominate flavors.   \nUsually, I try to salvage test foods, but this one ended up in the compost - there was no saving it.\nTo it's credit, this recipe produces a moist cake.",

By and large I disagree with them, and can only report my own result - and here it is - MMMM-MM. Yes, it IS a heavy, dense cake - not all cakes are SUPPOSED to be light and fluffy! This cake would be ideal where a sturdy cake is needed for carving.  It is rich and moist.  It's deliciously, delightfully and delicately orange flavored. I was somewhat suspicious of the disproportionately high sugar to flour ratio, but I went with the recipe as written and wasn't disappointed.  It might be a tad heavy on the oil, and I don't see that it would hurt anything to reduce it by 1/4 cup or so if that's more appealing to you, but I enjoyed this cake so much I'm not going to quibble about a couple of tablespoons!  I frosted it with a vanilla buttercream and loved it.  An orange flavored buttercream (including zest) would be nice with this too. On top of being toe-curling good, it couldn't have been easier to mix up and just HAS to be fool-proof because of it!",
