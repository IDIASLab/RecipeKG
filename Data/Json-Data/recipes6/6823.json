I use probably 3x the paprika (no idea how much, I just keep dumping - it's nearly impossible to use too much) - make sure it's good Hungarian paprika (Szeged is common on most grocery shelves).  Instead of pepper flakes, I add some hot paprika (again, Szeged) but you can add too much hot so use sparingly.  I sear the chicken on both sides before adding chicken broth (vs water.)  I also add some red bell pepper to the onion in the beginning and add the paprika part way through the sauteeing because this helps bring out the paprika flavor as well.   I don't use garlic or bacon grease - just olive oil.  Someone else posted their recipe for spaetzle and said to cook for 20 minutes.  This will turn the spaetzle to mush.  Spaetzle should be taken out of the simmering water with a slotted spoon once it rises to the surface as spaetzle/dumplings need to have some firmness to them.",

(Next time I'll use them with skin on - gives it more flavor) Instead of water I used 3 cans of chicken broth. I added 1 bay leaf ginger powder and garlic powder. I completely omitted the tomatoes and when it came time to use the juice I used one ladle of the soup to dissolve flour and mix w/ sour cream. Although you can't have paprikash without spaetzel (egg dumpling)! Since there's no spaetzel recipe on this site I'll post mine. Get a pot of salted water at a HIGH boil. Mix 1-1/2 c. flour 1/2 c. milk 3 eggs. Drop spoonfuls into the boiling water and cook for 20 minutes uncovered. Add to the paprikash. Yum!",

Also red pepper flakes can vary greatly in heat so a teaspoon might make your dish way too hot. I'd start out with a 1/4 tsp or less. You can always add more. It came out very well for me but I couldn't figure out why it seemed to lack the unique and very delicious flavor of the paprikash a Hungarian friend used to make for me. Eventually I found out it was CARAWAY that provided that taste - about a 1/2 tspn of seed lightly toasted in a dry pan and gently bruised. Just what it needed",
