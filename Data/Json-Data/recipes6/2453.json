With the corona virus social distancing, I was running low on fresh vegs, so very thin sliced carrots and some slices of green onion went in--the carrots with the onions at the beginning, and the green onion at the end--oh, yeah; also a little fresh spinach at the end. \nSounds icky, but it was what I had .  And, Yum!  The other BIG change I made was to use very thinly sliced pork shoulder instead of beef, which I did not have.  But I did have a whole pork shoulder bought cheaply to break down, and I used all the little bits and pieces left over from cutting around the bone.  I probably had two cups--did not weigh it.  And it was WONDERFUL!  Thank you for this recipe.",
