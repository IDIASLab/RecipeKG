It's learning to make dishes like this chicken and broccoli curry that allows you to go from someone who knows how to follow a recipe, to someone who actually creates recipes. The same basic technique is going to work no matter what meats, vegetables, and spices you use. Serve over rice, noodles, or even French fries for a curry version of poutine.",

The sauce is very flavorful - earthy and a little sweet due to the addition of the ketchup, but it's not overpowering at all. The flavors mesh really well together, and there's nothing to complain about. Definitely becoming a staple in our house now.",
