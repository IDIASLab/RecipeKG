I hope more bakers give this recipe a chance and bring that rating up to five stars where it belongs! I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter and substituted butter for the margarine called for in the streusel, keeping all else the same. I kind of had the feeling when I saw the ingredients called for vegetable oil (rather than butter or even shortening) that this would be moist and that's exactly what this is--moist, flavorful, and bursting with blueberry flavor. The topping amount is just right, with a pleasing buttery crunch.  I have made several of these coffeecakes or \"buckles,\" over the years, one in particular that has been my favorite for over 40 years. But as good as that recipe is, THIS recipe beats it hands down for moistness.  In fact, I think this is the finest recipe of its kind I've ever had!",

With a newly purchased 4 pound bag of blueberries tucked in my freezer and my 2 grandkids scheduled for an overnight with us, I was searching for a special breakfast treat.  I made this, pretty much according to directions, and half a cake later we all declared it a winner.  It was moist, flavorful, and had just the right amount of blueberries.  I added vanilla to the batter and substituted butter for margarine in the crumb topping as suggested by Naples.  I also used brown sugar instead of white in the topping.  It was delicious; however, next time I'll probably stick with the granulated sugar and try a little nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  I have a favorite blueberry muffin recipe that calls for a dusting of sugar and nutmeg and we really love that flavor combination.  For those who had issues with this being too dry or needing extra baking time, some things to check are pan size, oven thermostat, and your pan material.  Some pan coatings require lowering your oven temperature by 25 degrees.",
