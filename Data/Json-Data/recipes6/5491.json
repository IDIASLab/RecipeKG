First I used regular rice and so I started cooking it on the stove a bit before I added in the tomatoes. I didn't use a microwave at all but instead heated the peppers in the oven. I also added a little bit of garlic black pepper and cayenne pepper to the rice mix. This recipe was really really easy to make yet tasty... I am definitely going to make it in the future for company as a main dish. It's really hearty because of the beans too!",

I also added a few dashes of Frank's red hot sauce. I used microwave to cook peppers beans and corn. Cooked rice on stovetop and added all together. I baked in the oven at 325 for about 10 minutes then added cheese. I turned oven to warm until wife came home. She loved it. We froze remainder and looks like enough for 4 halves. Great easy recipe.
