It simply didn\u2019t thicken after adding the cream and peas.  All of the chicken pot pie flavors are in this, but I must say I do miss the crust.  One thing that I really like is that  the ingredients in this recipe are ones that I always have on hand, so I could see this turning into a \"go-to recipe.\"  My husband asked me if this was a soup and when I told him it wasn\u2019t, his next question was \u201care we having this over rice or noodles?\u201d  I did cook up a few noodles, mostly for him, at least he was happy!  Once I had the consistency to where I wanted, I switched over to Slow Cook, low temperature, until we were ready to eat.  This was good, even without the crust, and I will make this again.",

It's still very runny so I added a cornstarch slurry and 2 tbsp of GF flour/ butter mixture which thicken it really well. First time I made this I put it over mashed potatoes but 2nd I poured it into 9x13 and topped it with GF stuffing (Aldis) and popped it into oven until stuffing browned. If you're missing the crust I suggest using stuffing. It's amazing!!",

Flavors are here for a pot pie but the consistency of a thin chicken soup--a really tasty chicken soup! Mine didn't thicken up to achieve more of a creamy pot pie mixture I was hoping for (lactose free and subbed with coconut cream). I made a cornstarch slurry which helped a little but not enough. I'm guilty and made some gluten free elbow noodles to go with the soup. Will make this again but will try ladling out some of the excess broth before adding the cream or try making a little basic bechamel sauce and grate in some cheddar cheese to the sauce to add to the soup when it's done. I'm wondering if adding some shredded or small cubed potatoes would work in absorbing some of the liquid too. Lots of room to play with the recipe if desired but really it does make a very good and quick chicken soup! Thanks for the recipe!",
