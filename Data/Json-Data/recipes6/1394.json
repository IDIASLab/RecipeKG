No need to measure just sprinkle on to your taste. Makes this even more delicious. I do not measure the brown sugar or butter either. This is so easy enough butter to cover the bottom of the skillet sugar taste and sprinkle on the cloves. You cannot miss! The longer it cooks it will start to caramelize. Add a little butter if you think it needs some as it cooks. Take it out when you like the doneness. Make a little extra (like bacon) you will want to sample a piece. Yum!:)",
