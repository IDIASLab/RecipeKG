Don't scoop out a cup and pour into your bowl.  Sift your flour into the measuring cup, then level it off.  Yes, this takes extra time but it's a HUGE difference.  This will give your cake the dense texture you're looking for.  Please also cream the butter with the cake flour and the sugar, then pour in your milk/egg mixture.  Also, please make sure all your cold ingredients are room temperature (about 65F)that's milk, eggs and butter.",

Using all-purpose flour in a cake recipe, especially nearly 4 cups, can sometimes yield a heavier and more crumbly texture. Try substituting cake flour, but use only 3 cups, sifted. Eliminate the baking powder and add an extra 1/2 t. vanilla. Since you're reducing the cake flour, also reduce the buttermilk to 2 1/4 cups and sugar to 2 cups and see how this turns out.",

I increased the sugar to 3 1/2 cups to suit my sweet tooth and beat the batter considerably more than just to incorporate flour. I used juice of 1 lemon mixed with only 2 cups of milk instead of buttermilk and baked it considerably longer than stated. Served it with chocolate peanut butter frosting and got only raves.
