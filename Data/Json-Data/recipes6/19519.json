Now I remember making this cake mix a lot growing up until Pillsbury had the nerve to discontinue it. I have just made the cake from the recipe and followed it exactly except I buried my coconut ring of filling under some of the cake batter. Upon tasting the cake I noticed several things... The first was it was heaver than the original. It was also lighter in color. The coconut filling of the original was denser when it was spooned into the cake batter (which is why I believe it would sink while baking) the coconut filling was more finely chopped (almost minced?) and more of it. The coconut filling was more the consistency and texture of a thickish pudding. (sorry best way I can describe it). Does anyone else remember this? I have been looking for a duplicate for that Pillsbury recipe for many many years. Can anyone fine-tune this recipe to make it more like the original?",

I followed the directions EXACTLY and against my better judgment did not alter the directions to put the \"tunnel\" of coconut filling in between layers of chocolate batter. The chocolate cake was good (a big like a pound cake in texture) BUT the coconut layer was never enveloped by the chocolate cake. Result? No \"tunnel\" of coconut filling but a crispy top (actually the bottom) of a crisp coconut egg-white mixture that we chipped off. We enjoyed the chocolate cake nonetheless but I was very disappointed that there was no tunnel of coconut. I'll give it another go -- and next time will put half of the batter in and then the coconut mixture and then the other half of the batter. The other point I'll share with y'all is that I used the new silicone style bundt pan and the cake took 90 minutes to bake (and no it wasn't overcooked at all by some miracle). So give this a go but do alter the directions and do not leave the coconut topping on top of the chocolate batter. I also think that a box mix (gasp!) might be closer to the original cake than this one although this one is very good and is VERY much like the chocolate pound cake at Starbucks! This cake baked as a pound cake with an espresso/cocoa drizzle would be excellent with a great cup of coffee or espresso!",
