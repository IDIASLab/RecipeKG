I made this in a bundt cake pan, spraying the pan with nonstick/flour spray, sprinkling chopped nuts into the bottom before putting in part of the batter... then using the \"streusel\" portion of the recipe (omitting the butter) mixed with 1-2 Tbsp. cocoa powder as 2 separate \"layers\" between the batter (pour in some batter, sprinkle streusel, more batter, more streusel, and top with the last of the batter.  I baked it at 350-degrees for an hour, with no other adjustments for high altitude (we're at 7220-ft).  When it's cut, the streusel inside made it look like it was a lot more work than it really was.  This really beats banana bread for using up some very ripe bananas!",

I did add 1/2 c. chopped roasted walnuts 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and I skipped the topping and just sprinkled the tops with cinnamon/sugar. I think these are a little too sweet but the flavor is the best I've had in a banana muffin. This was right on with cooking time and amount of muffins made. I think this recipe would be perfect with the sugar cut in half and my small adjustments. NOTE: This muffin recipe didn't overflow in my muffin tins like I've had happen with other recipes. I filled each muffin tin with an overflowing 1/4 c. of batter. EDITED: I have made this muffin recipe three times since first reviewing it. It has become our favorite banana muffin to date. I did cut back the white sugar to just under 1/4 c. and added one more banana chopped TO HALF A RECIPE'S WORTH. The toasted walnuts I added really make this stellar.",

I topped the stresal with sliced almonds before baking. Yummy. Also if you make your own spiced alcohol from cheap vodka or whatever is on sale the flavor is much stronger and you won't need to add powdered spices. This trick is good for lots of recipes epecially pumpkin pie!",
