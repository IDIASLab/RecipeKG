I took someone's suggestion on toasting the pecans in butter before adding it to the cake and instead of margarine, I used unsalted butter (since one person said the cake was somewhat salty).  Instead of using whipped cream - I made crumb cake crumbs and baked them on during the last 15 minutes of baking (to make crumbs: use 2 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon 1 1/2 stick unsalted butter melted - I mixed them all together with my hands and put them on top of the pecan/pumpkin/cake mixture).  The crumbs, buttery pecans, cake mix & pumpkin mixture was so unbelievable (although filling) everyone raved about it !!!!  I think next year though I will cut back on the sugar and butter as it is such a sweet cake and rich cake having one sliver is almost too much to eat and there's no room for other desserts !  Thank you for this superb recipe !!!  YUMMMM !",

The paper should peel off smoothly. For the topping, mix one tub of whipped topping, one block cream cheese (room temp.), and 1/2 cup powdered sugar until smooth. Spread over top of dessert. I also only use 3 eggs instead of 4 for the pumpkin mixture, 1 cup sugar, and toast the pecans. I hope this is helpful!",

Most of my changes came from other reviews: liberal with the amount of pumpkin; reduce eggs to only 3; reduce sugar to under 1 cup; use spice cake mix; blend cake mix, nuts & melted butter all together in crumb mixture and then crumble over pumpkin mix; cover with foil for 45 min. then remove foil for last 20-25.\nPhew! That's a lot of changes! But totally worth it. I'm already looking forward to sneaking some for breakfast.",

The pecans are a MUST, they add a needed taste!  I have made this for the last 3 years for Thanksgiving and Christmas, rather than pie.  It's much easier, and much better than plain old pumpkin pie.
