Use the old baker's tricks of letting your buttermilk, milk and eggs sit out for an hour before baking to get to room tempurature and you'll get increased fluff on these.  And don't overmix.  Be sure to leave small lumps of flour that break open when pouring out the mix on the griddle.  I used blueberries today and they turned out great - coat any fruit you want to add in a bit of the flour mixture first and you'll find they don't all drop to the bottom.  Great recipe.  Thanks.",

Like other reviewers, this made WAY more than the listed 12 five inch pancakes!!  I could easily have fed my 5 family members with just 1/3 of the batter.  The first batch I made (exactly as the recipe is written) weren't stellar.  I found them to be heavy and strikingly like French Toast.  (They DID make pretty good waffles as I had a TON of batter leftover.)\r\n\r\nOn my next batch (scaled down to 1/3) I added one extra teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of lemon juice.  My trick for getting these nice and fluffy was to let the batter sit for a day or two in the refrigerator.  The oxidation of the lemon juice and baking soda really caused the batter to swell with all those wonderful air bubbles that make a nice, tender and fluffy pancake.  Making this on Sunday night and using it during the week has made this recipe a staple in my home.  My family can't get enough of them!!",

I didn't even use a fork, I just poured the syrup on a plate and dipped!  Piggy, don't you think?  :)  I am saving the rest for tomorrow and will just toast them in the toaster-oven.  Can't wait!",

I would, however, make one tiny suggestion: When adding all the wet ingredients together, make sure the butter has cooled somewhat, so as not to \"cook\" the eggs in the batter.  You'll wind up with super lumpy pancake batter!  You could also add the butter to the milk first, mix, then add the eggs, but DO NOT ADD THE BUTTER RIGHT OFF THE STOVE if you've already added the eggs!  I also added some vanilla for extra flavor.  Light, fluffy, and yummy!\r\n",

I have cooked these several times, once with milk soured with vinegar (turned out good) and then all the other times with the fresh buttermilk (turned out HEAVENLY).  I would not make these again without the fresh buttermilk!  I made them for some friends one morning too and both demanded the recipe before they left the house!  They just melt in your mouth!  Hubby loves them too!  The only thing I added was vanilla and some cinnamon - but that's just some flavoring that I like in my pancakes.  These are FANTASTIC!  Thanks for such a great recipe!",
