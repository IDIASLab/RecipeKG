Substute most of the oil for applesauce (I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce). To eliminate even more sugar (and the fat from the pork) I used a 16 oz. jar of home-canned black beans in place of the baked beans with pork. To hide the beans I substituted 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder for the 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also have a wheat grinder so I ground fresh whole wheat flour and substituted it for the white flour. I left out the raisins. With these changes you can transform this recipe into a DELICIOUS HEALTHY CHOCOLATE BLACK BEAN CAKE. Yum!",

I have a pet peeve when people don't follow the recipes and change things around then give less than 5 stars it makes me mad. Very good cake. I made the 2 loaves. Tastes like a pumpkin type flavor. I will definately make it again and again. Thanks for the submission.",

I don't use two cups of sugar one is plenty and I also use butter or margerine instead of vegetable oil. Instead of just cinnamon I'll add two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and I soak my raisins in hot juice or rum (making sure to drain them well) before adding them to the batter. It is one of those spice cakes where people remark on \"OMG this is SO good....how did you make it?\" and then once they find out they HAVE to make it themselves so they can fool someone else. This is also good as cupcakes with a Cream Cheese Frosting. GREAT for White Trash Parties!",
