But made as written.\" I mixed up all of the above ingredients as the recipe states and realized that there was no reason not to treat it as a marinade instead so I let the cubed chicken swim in it for about 4 hrs. then quick stir-fried the chicken can mushrooms and a floppy looking onion half that was lonely in the fridge and served it all over rice w/ a steamed veggie side. I didn't like the Italian dressing flavor and would've preferred that part was just olive oil and we also thought it was in need of salt at serving but maybe that's b/c I usually use low-sodium soy sauce.
