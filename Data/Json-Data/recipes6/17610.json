After the fact I compared the measurements to another similar recipe that I had made before.

Some like a more heavier cake and others like fluff so I made one in a regular cake pan and one in the bundt to get both effects. The only things I changed was  I used cake flour, adding a 1/2 cup of Mayo and 1/2tspn of vanilla & almond w a whole squeeze lemon and baked at 345\u00b0 The cake turned out wonderful!",
