Will do this one many more times to come.  Made adjustments: roasted walnuts; use 1/2 c. karo, and 1/4 c. 100% maple syrup.  I think that is what made the difference.  Again fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I read a lot of the reviews that said they used maple syrup and I can totally see that happening and being really good, but I don't like maple. I did add an extra 1/3 cup of walnuts, but that's just my gig, I like walnuts. I really like pecan pie but it's go GAWDAWFUL sweet and rich that I can't eat more than a tiny sliver. This is not like that...it is sweet, yes, but, seriously, I could eat this whole pie...it's that good! It's great with a cup of coffee, which is what I'm doing right now. Thank you, Vivian, for submitting this delicious recipe and I'll be making another one of these for Thanksgiving.",

I did experience some difficulties in the cooking process, but I know that was due to my inexperience with making walnut/pecan pies and also because of my horrible oven and its temperature issues.  I followed the baking directions exactly, but my pie was still noticeably underdone even after an extra 20 minutes.  I raised the temperature, but it was still hard for me to tell when it was done, and eventually I overcooked it.  I did some post-baking research and found a link on savorsa dot com (which I can't apparently post in this review, because it was removed) which discusses the various baking times/temperatures for pecan pies and how to tell when they are done. It was very useful for me as a beginner with pecan/walnut pies, so I wanted to mention it in case it helps other people, too.  Again, this is an excellent recipe.  Clearly, the baking time/temperature works well for other people, so I'm not going to be one of Those People who 1-star a recipe based on what are obviously their own personal issues.  But if you think you might need more information than the recipe provides for knowing when the pie is done (\"continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes\" is kind of vague for non-experts), then check out some other resources beforehand.  I will definitely make this again using this recipe's ingredients, but I will use a different baking time/temperature.",
