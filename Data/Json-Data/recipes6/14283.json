I made a few changed:  I used apple cider vinegar, plus more of it, I also used brown sugar rather than the white.  I did however cook the cabbage a little too long, I would have liked a more firm texture and the apples lost their texture as well.  Otherwise this is a nice dish, a little different and a pleasant change from corn or green beans!",
