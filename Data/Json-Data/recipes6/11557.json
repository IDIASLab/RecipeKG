When putting on the orange syrup at the end.. she would take a long wooden skewer and as she poured the syrup on she would poke holes for the syrup to drain down into.... Everyone loved this cake and in her heyday she was making 20 of these cakes for friends. She had 5 kids and we all had duties to help.. But we LOVED helping.. It was a Christmas Tradition..On we all LOVED.... My job was to zest the oranges then squeeze them into juice.... I notice this recipe doesn't use orange zest hmmmm",
