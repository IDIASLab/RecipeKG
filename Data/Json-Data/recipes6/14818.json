I made this cake again with a few additions based on what others have suggested (1/8 tsp. lemon extract, 1 tsp. almond extract, and 1/2 tsp. salt).  Those additions made a huge flavor improvement upon the original recipe.  I found that this cake bakes up beautifully in several different sized cake pans, but didn't do as well in cupcake form.  It is also very sweet (similar to cotton candy in taste) and very dense, but it cuts beautifully and stays moist for a couple of days.  I can understand why others have described it as being Pound Cake-like, but that's not completely accurate.... pound cakes are indeed heavy and moist, but they also have an incredibly silky texture, and a delicately sweet buttery flavor that just melts in your mouth - although delicious, this cake is nothing like a pound cake.",

I separated the eggs and whipped the whites to soft peaks before putting them in. But with those changes I will use this recipe for all wedding cakes to come! It is very important for all ingredients to be at room temperature for good texture and also very important to take it out of the oven right when it's done or it will get dry. It is NOT a white cake (butter and egg yolks!) but turned out very pale yellow has a fine crumb is soft and delicious. I love it and I am very picky about cakes.",
