I chopped the celery finely and cooked it with the rest of the vegetables. I used orange bell pepper and chili-ready diced tomatoes since I had those on hand. At last tasting, it was really, really good and once it cooks for the rest of the evening I'm sure it will be outstanding. I was afraid without meat that it would be bland, but it's not bland at all! Thank you, thank you for this. It's going into my files.",

I live in Florida with lots of Cuban restaurants, and this measured up really well to many that I\u2019ve had and enjoyed.  The only modification I made was cutting the chili flakes back to 1/2 teaspoon, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. When finished cooking, I tasted,  gave it a pretty good shot of  hot sauce, and garnished with some chopped red onion and cilantro.  WorkingCookingMom, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it!",
