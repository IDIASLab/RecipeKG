The secret is to mix by hand and not to overmix. I added walnuts and mixed it up night before and kept in refrigerator to bake fresh in morning.   Muffins didn't stick to paper liners.

I always make the mini muffins and you MUST increase the time by several minutes (if you want them golden on top and not mushy).  The kids gobble them up!!",

I must admit that I used 3 cups of mashed bananas per batch and I really don't know how many cups 3 large bananas make.    My kids gobbled up these muffins (mini & full size) and I realized I finally found a more convenient (and yummier) \"Banana Bread\" recipe than the one I had.  These muffins taste exactly like the bread recipe I've been searching for!  Whoever said Banana Bread had to be in loaf form?  :)  Thanks so much!      *TIP*  I always have several bags of frozen mashed bananas on hand.  I used to just freeze the whole banana, but realized it was much easier to mash them up beforehand and portion them at 2-3 cups per Quart Freezer Ziplock bag.  Lay them flat in a 13 x 9 pan and freeze.  Once frozen you can remove them from the pan and store them in the freezer.",
