I used the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt and plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg as before. However, I am always interested in making recipes healthier so instead of margarine, oil or butter I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I often buy applesauce in those little single serving cups and one container is exactly 1/2 cup. Perfect for baking since you don't have to open a whole jar of applesauce. I added chopped walnuts as before but I was out of vanilla, so I tossed in about a Tbsp of dark rum. Wow!! That is the secret to butt-kicking banana bread!! Use good quality rum, such as Puerto Rican or Dominican rum. A good rule of thumb is..if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it! Same goes for wine. I cannot stop eating this bread and now I don't feel guilty because it's low in fat if you use the applesauce instead of oil or butter. I really hope someone reads this review and tries the rum version I have come up with. Enjoy!!",

I had 3 overripe bananas that I was getting ready to throw out, instead the light bulb went off to look on Allrecipes for an easy banana bread recipe.  I chose this one based on the reviews and the simplicity of the ingredients.  The only slight changes I made was I used butter instead of margarine, switched the white sugar to half white and half brown, and cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. I also threw in 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon.  It turned out perfect in 45 min. (an hour would have dried the bread out) and it is dense and moist like banana bread should be!  Thanks Libby, I will probably make this weekly with my leftover bananas!",

I did modify some things--used real butter, half white and half brown sugar, added 1 tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and a dash of salt.  I didn't measure the bananas, but used the four I had on hand that were mostly black on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.  Sprinkled the top with sliced almonds, since it's what I had on hand.  It baked up beautifully in exactly one hour.  What a great Sunday breakfast!",
