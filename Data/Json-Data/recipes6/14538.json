Sometimes I chop cucumber, carrot, crushed garlic and tomato and add the oil, vinegar and sugar.  For spice, I might add one or more of the following: chili pepper, herbs de provance, oregano, celery seed, pepper flakes, ancho chili powder.  When making the slaw with cabbage I use the red kind because it's so beautiful but it does need to to sit for a day as the cabbage needs time to absorb the acid of the vinegar and breakdown some of the \"rubbery squeakiness\" on the teeth.  I also add about a teaspoon of some fresh herb (yesterday it was parsley).  I think it needs some green herb.",
