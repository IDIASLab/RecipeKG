                "reviewBody": "I really like this bread. I baked it for about 55 minutes and it turned out well. I didn't add raisins bc half of the dough was made into a pastrami experiment (I halved the recipe to make 2 loaves) and I didn't think pastrami and raisins went well together. I also used my bread machine to mix the dough since I'm lazy like that. I really like the end result but I had to tinker a bit with the amount of water. It wasn't quite enough at first so the dough wasn't mixing. I added about 1/4 c of water. The dough was a bit sticky at the end bc I accidently added more water than I meant to but it worked well enough. I think this bread needs an egg wash; it doesn't come out golden brown at all; just sort of a light tan color that isn't that pretty. Aside from that though I really like the bread. Fennel is one of my favorite flavors though--if you don't like it don't bother. Thank you for the recipe! Worth trying again!",

There is too much water and as a result I needed to use 5 3/4 cups of bread flour to even come close to a kneadable dough which meant the ratio of fennel was off. Then The tops of the loaves were getting too dark but the inside wasn't fully baked even though I turned the oven down to 325 so I am hoping I didn't burn out the motor of my mixer and that this toasts up well.",
