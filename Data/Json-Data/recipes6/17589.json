When I bake the cake I left out 2 TBSP of the sugar in the batter and next time will leave out all together. Not sure why it is added anyway the cake is very sweet. My guests all loved it. I felt sorry for the other dessert as people came back for seconds of this cake. I know this group of people well and I don't remember anyone eating seconds of dessert before. I just sent the recipe to one of them who asked for it too I had it again for breakfast and it was even moister this morning. I will definitely make again.",
