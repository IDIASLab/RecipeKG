I also recently discovered that balsamic vinegar on these is the BOMB! But I use pepper sauce too. Thanks for all the great feedback and suggestions!!",

Used 1/2 tsp of my Dad's creole seasoning I omitted any extra salt or pepper and did not include the vinegar. Also sauteed onions in a tablespoon of canola oil along with a couple of cloves of minced garlic and the creole seasoning before adding ham hocks salt pork chicken stock and bay leaves. I let this cook for about 2 hours to really get the pot liquor a nice flavor. After adding the greens I let this cook for another 1-1/2 on low. Chopped up the meat from the salt pork (removed all the fat) and from the ham hocks and added that to the finished greens. My husband loved this the first time out of the pot.

Then start a fresh pot with water to cover and cook until almost tender but not quite done. Then add your remaining ingredients and salt pork with your greens and bring to a boil.
