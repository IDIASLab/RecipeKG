I added a few of my own touches to it- applesauce instead of oil 4 tbs. jam(strawberry) IN the batter and 1 tsp of vanilla extract in the batter as well. It is important to let the muffins sit for about 2 min in the pan before taking them out so the jam will not spill out the bottom. I drizzled a mixture of honey vanilla and red food coloring on the top of my muffins right after they came out. It really dressed them up. I will make these again!",

                "reviewBody": "My mom used to make jam-filled muffins.  I hadn't thought about it for a long time, then I found this recipe today.  I halved the recipe so I could make 6 muffins in the toaster oven and not heat up the whole kitchen by using the big oven.  (It's August!)  I used half white wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, red currant and black currant preserves, and chopped hazelnuts on top.  When assembling the muffins, put a bit of batter in the bottom of the muffin cup, then add a dab of jam (not too much), then top with more batter.  Try to \"seal\" in the jam with the batter so it doesn't boil out.  Don't put in too much jam or it will boil over and burn and stick in the pan.\n\nThese were really good!  It's not an overly sweet, caky muffin, but a more traditional muffin that's slightly sweet.  (Like how scones are supposed to be only slightly sweet, not the icky cake-cookie concoctions at Starbuck's--too sweet!)  The real sweetness comes from the jam inside, all hot and melty.\n\nLet the muffins cool a minute or two before you bite into it...keep the kids away for a bit, you know they're going to grab 'em right away.  The jam inside is HOT and you don't want to burn your mouth.\n\nYUMMY breakfast muffin and super easy, with ingredients you have on hand.  It's a keeper!",

I put sweetened flaked coconut on a couple of the muffins then put them all in at 350 for about 22-24 minutes.(These ones were the best!) I made them medium sized by filling up only 7 muffins. I would double this recipe and cut the oil down with some applesauce next time. Good basic recipe though-takes like 10 minutes to make!",

                "reviewBody": "I just whipped this recipe up in about an hour and a half with all clean up and such. Here's the recipe I followed (from various readers input and what I had in my kitchen): 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar (plus some extra for topping) 3 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup milk 1 tsp. vanilla 1/3 cup applesauce 1 egg 2 tablespoons any flavor fruit jam I also put the jam in the middle (as some suggested) and it was delicious. I think the best way to do it is to mix it in a tiny bit (marble it) with a fork. That way it doesn't bubble up as much. Before baking I also sprinkled a teaspoon or so of brown sugar on the tops. Just plain brown sugar. It hardened and blended in during the baking BUT it tastes delicious. Gives it an extra kick with a little crunch and some sweetness to balance the batter (since the jam resided mostly in the bottom on mine). These were very easy to make and I had all the ingredients in the house which makes it better. A little bit of jam bubbled up on the outside of my pan but I just rinsed it under hot water and scrubbed it right after I took the muffins out. It took maybe three minutes to clean and wasn't that hard. Overall this recipe is a solid 4. Tasty but not amazingly outstanding. But I will probably make it again- it's easy and the men of the house seem to like it. =) Thanks for sharing!",
