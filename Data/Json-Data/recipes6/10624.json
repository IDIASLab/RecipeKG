They turned out like a picture...and so fluffy and light but yet rich buttery flavor.  They were not at all heavy...feathery light.  The only modifications I made were I heated my water 105-115degrees and added butter flavor shortening to that.  I added it to the dry yeast, sugar, and 2 cups of flour.  I then added all but the last half cup of flour blended with the salt.  I had always been taught that salt can kill yeast if added directly so I never add salt until I have added some of the flour first.  I use the last half cup of flour to knead into the yeast adding a little at a time because all flours differ.  I only use bread flour with my bread making.  By heating the liquid to between 105-115, it cut down on the kneading time tremendously...cut it in half.  After the rolls came out of the oven, I immediately brushed the tops with butter using a pastry brush.  They came out of the pan with ease(I use cooking spray to coat bottom and sides of pan) and everyone raved about them.",

The whole family is requesting these rolls at every meal...a tip...I use 1/3 and freeze the dough in ziploc bags(2 bags with 1/3 each)...the next 2 nights I thaw the bread for 2-2-1/2 hours form into rolls and allow to rise the second time.  That way we get fresh rolls for 3 nights with one batch!!  Each batch is as good as the first.",

I made my rolls a little bigger so I yielded 18 rolls instead of the 24 stated in the recipe. I used butter flavored shortening and melted it first in a saucepan then added the cold water to it. That made the water/shortening mixture the perfect temperature for the flour mixture. The 18 rolls turned out large and fluffy with a great taste that didn't need any extra butter on top. My older daughter ate 3 of these large rolls and almost ignored the rest of the dinner!",

I proofed the yeast with the warm water (I didn't use cold water, yeast works better with warm water) and sugar for ten minutes, then I added the melted butter (which I used instead of shortening) and all the dry ingredients. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or so. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll), covered them with saran wrap and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was just right for me. Decent dinner roll. NOTE: When you make this roll recipe--don't follow the instructions on letting it rise. Use warm water. Using cold water may work for others but it's never worked for me. It'll save you some wasted ingredients in the end.",

It wasn't in the cupboard for a long time; I just bought it at the store the day I made the rolls. I'm an inexperienced baker so the outcome was probably my fault--but I don't know what I did wrong.",
