The only change I made was to slightly pulse the onion soup mix in my food processor to get a more even texture.  No additional salt/pepper was needed upon serving.  The one issue I had was the mayo in the microwave. I heated it for 20 seconds and it curlded - not very appetizing, but I was able to brush it on the chicken regardless.  I would leave the step out next time. Just whisk the mayo and garlic paste together, and it'll be a good consistency to brush on the chicken, no heating needed.  Depending on the size of your chicken breasts, you may need to bake them a little longer, but I found 20 minutes to be perfect for the 6-8oz breasts I was using.",
