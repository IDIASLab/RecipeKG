Instead of make this in the tube pan, I made muffins out of it.  The recipe for me made 24 muffins (make sure to use liners or they do stick).  I have my muffins currently frozen and I take one down a night for a strawberry dessert.  For anyone interested also I am on weight watchers and I calculated the muffins to be about 1 1/2 pts a piece.  A great snack :)",

As for baking time, you can never go totally by any recipe. Always deduct 10 minutes, set your timer and go from there. Every oven is different, as most are not calibrated exactly. If you follow this recipe exactly, your cake will rise above the level of the pan and have excellent flavor and texture. Note the recipe tells you to add the sugar gradually (no need to process if you do this!), and then later to FOLD in the flour, etc. This means to use a spatula and fold from top to bottom--don't use your mixer and no stirring. If you don't fold, or if you overfold, you will loose your volume for the cake! I sliced this into 3 layers and filled with lemon curd and white chocolate buttercream, then frosted w/the buttercream! Everyone totally loved it and raved about how incredible the cake was!! This is a GREAT recipe!",

I followed previous ratings and \"whipped it till the cows came home\".  With the leftover egg yolks I made egg noodles!!

I didn't have any cake flour on hand so I sifted regular all-purpose flour 3 times and then deducted 2 tablespoons.  I also added half a teaspoon of almond extract, just to add another dimension to the angel food cake.  The variations you can make are boundless.  I would think adding lemon / orange zest would be great as well.  Oh also, to prevent over-burning, perhaps you can try covering it with foil for 20 minutes or so. Yum!",
