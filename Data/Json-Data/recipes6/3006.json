I used sunflower butter and it really overpowered the other flavors so all you could taste was the cocoa powder and sunflower butter. But! No one could tell it was made with beans! And when served with graham crackers it helped balance out the flavors and people seemed to like it at the party. So maybe if the amount of sunflower butter was reduced it would taste better but I don't think I'll be making this again.",

I used peanut butter instead of almond butter and next time I would reduce the peanut butter to 1/4 cup. The peanut butter overpowered the dip. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. Everyone loved it including the kids (11 kids under 8) I served it with animal crackers and apple slices. Definitely will be making this again thank you Allstars!!",
