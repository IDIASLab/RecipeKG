That was the only change I made and I actually liked the stronger onion flavor. This is a good broth with mild fish flavor and one worth hanging on to fish parts when you are dealing with whole fish. I do think you could double the cook time with better results. The peppercorns had just barely softened and the remaining fish on the bones still clung to the bones making me think longer cook time would have yielded more flavor.",
