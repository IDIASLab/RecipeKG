Didn't have any and based off of a recipe for pumpkin pie spice on this site (seriously!) I mixed into a small container 3/4 tsp each of ginger cloves nutmeg and about 2 tsp cinnamon. Mixed together and it was just about perfect for 1.5 tbl of pumpkin pie spice. PLEASE NOTE I baked this carrot cake in TWO 9\" WILTON ROUND PANS not a Bundt pan. If you choose to do this too the baking time will be approximately 30 minutes. ALSO NOTE that there is too much batter for two standard 9\" pans. I placed 3 cups of batter into each pan spread evenly and it was about 3/4 full. It turned out to be the perfect amount as the cake doesn't rise much. There was enough batter left over for 4 cupcakes which I baked for about 20-22 minutes. Before baking in the pans and the paper cup liners I sprayed with cooking spray but didn't bother with flouring. I had no problems getting my cakes out of the pans after they had cooled on racks. I had my doubts over the coconut and pineapple in carrot cake but I couldn't even taste the pineapple and the coconut seemed to give it that decadent bakery flavor. This was a dense cake moist and just delish. It could definitely pass for a professional bakery cake. I paired it with the cream cheese frosting II from this site. I made this on Saturday for Easter dinner. Not sure if making it a day before helped i",
