I made for my 4-H club and they loved it so much I made it a couple more times. The raisins are just a filler because I felt the granola bars were lacking without it. The granola bars still taste good without it. Dried fruit or nuts can be substituted.",

I hate dry granola bars that crunch and crumble when you bite into them. I loved the moistness of these bars but they were a little bit on the soft side difficult to hold without falling apart. Have to wonder if a little more flour would take care of that?? But they have great flavor we enjoyed them and I'd make again!",

Used only 2 tbsp of cane sugar instead of the brown sugar as written. Omitted corn syrup. Added craisins and shredded coconut. Baked for 25 mins at 350F. Cooled for 20 mins cut into bars and put them on a rack to continue cooling overnight. The bar held together well and the texture was similar to the oat bar at Starbucks (very chewy!) I like how there was no oil in this recipe.",
