I needed to use up some plain yogurt to I tried this recipe. The only changes I made were to use Splenda in place of the sugar plus a tiny squeeze of honey(less than a tablespoon). I also used a little bit(about a tablespoon) of the new \"Enova\" oil. It was so good and moist, not too sweet and the texture stayed nice for a couple of days afterwards. We liked the leftover chunks split and toasted with a touch of grated sharp cheddar cheese sprinked on then. I am looking forward to making another batch and adding some chopped fresh jalapenos!
