This year it was my turn to prepare the feast, so I tried this recipe.

Even my father, who hates turnips but dutifully takes a spoonful each year, got up for a second helping.  Thank you for a nice change to the traditional mashed turnip!!",

I usually \"drape\" my turkey with bacon slices so once the turkey's cooked I simply crumble up the bacon slices and add them (with 1 T. of the turkey drippings) to the root mixture. Turnips are bland so for simpler occasions (such as a normal family meal) I slice up a yellow onion and cook it along with a couple of bacon slices. I've also been known to toss in some chopped scallion greens OR parsley OR chives OR cilantro just before serving to give it both some added flavor and some color (garlic lover that I am I do NOT recommend adding garlic to this; too overpowering even for my tastes). This dish goes very well with a beef roast pork chops and roasted chicken too. Also carrots can be substituted for the turnips and you wouldn't necessarily need to add any sugar. All in all a good hearty side addition to any cold day meal.",

I used Yukon Gold potatoes which have their own richness. I think I used too much sugar 1 tsp would have been good. All in all a great recipe.",
