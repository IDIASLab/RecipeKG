The first time I made them I did make them in the 16 x 11 pan that T. Lee instructed and I baked for the 30 minutes it stated. I had no problem getting it spead into the pan but they came out burnt to thin and way toooo crispy. So the next 3 times I have made them I used a 9 x 13 cookie sheet with sides and set the timer for 22 minutes. My experience has been absolutley do not bake these longer than 25 minutes and for my oven I only bake for 22 - 24 minutes. I also tried this recipe with walnuts and I always sprinkle it with a sugar mixed with cinnamon instead of plain sugar. Also try serving with real vanilla ice cream the crunch with a good ice cream is sooo perfect! Better yet cut and make into ice cream sandwiches! These are quick great tasting and worth trying because for such few ingrediets it goes a long way!",

I'll be playing around with this recipe and will let you know if I find anything that really makes these bars pop. Their flavor is good and they look very attractive. If you're looking for something super sweet and moist though this is not the right recipe. They have that subtle sweetness to them that isn't overwhelming and are more of a \"dunking treat\" than a \"snacking treat.\" Perfect for a cup of tea or coffee. I also agree that the recipe should call for a 9x13 pan especially with how dry and hard to spread the batter is. If you want super thin though the larger pan size could work - just watch your heat and time.",
