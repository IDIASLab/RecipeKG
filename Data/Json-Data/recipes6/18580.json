As written it's got way too much lemon for the other ingredients (in my opinion - try it as written and add to it if you have the same opinion). I added another tsp of sugar and a little more soy and we really enjoyed it. Interesting flavor and texture combination. I cut my apple and tomatoes into bite-size pieces for easier eating. We all ended up really liking it (except for the tomato-hater among us). Thanks for the recipe!",

I used 1 tbsp sugar 1 tbsp soy sauce 1/2 medium lemon several drops of bottled hot sauce until it had a kick I was happy with (no chilies on hand) and 1/2 cup peanuts. Both hubby and I were unsure of what we thought when we first tried it bu the more we ate the more we liked it. I think 1/2 cup nuts gave it good crunch and flavor and more would have been too much.",

I don't think this needs any salt at all considering that one of the ingredients is soy sauce which is loaded with sodium. Although I added it this time I won't in the future....too salty! One cup of chopped peanuts is waaaaaay too much IMO (and that has to be where most of the calories are coming from) so just chop a few and use as a garnish. I used multi-colored small sliced tomatoes a jalape\u00f1o and chili-lime cashews instead of peanuts. Quick little side salad with an interesting combo of flavors. The apple partners well with the spiciness of the jalape\u00f1os. It's good and I will make again just needs a little tweaking.",

For the dressing I omitted the salt and upped the soy sauce to two tablespoons. I also upped the sugar to one tablespoon and I added two tablespoons of EVOO and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 lemon instead of a whole one which was plenty. In addition I added in about one cup of slivered snow peas and 1 1/2 cups of canned chickpeas. I used a full cup of peanuts on the top. The tomatoes I used were very ripe and juicy which made the dressing just wonderful; the longer the salad sat (about 15 minutes before serving) the more the flavor of the tomatoes leached into the dressing. It was perfect! I also served this over greens. With the addition of the snow peas and chickpeas this was a light but filling main dish salad. Thanks for the inspiring recipe!",
