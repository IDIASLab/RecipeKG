The consistency was quite thin though (followed all directions). So thin that there were holes in the tortilla so I added more flour to a pancake consistency which helped. They were nice and pliable for fajitas but still thin. I left some of the batter to finish after dinner and they made the thickest best tortillas. I think having it sit for 30 mins or so not just the 5 might really help. As a plus I stored the extras in the fridge with paper towels around them in a zipper bag and they've kept really well for a week. This is my tortilla recipe thus far. Thanks! (3 photos show straight recipe then added more flour then had batter sit - best)",

So I added more coconut flour to thicken it and it worked but it doesn't taste like a wrap. I will use the huge amount it made to make pancakes instead. I would not recommend this recipe unless you can get the consistency better.",
