Both the wife and I thought they tasted better than imagined and after frying the flour tortillas they had kind of a pie dough flavor to them. I recommend using a shaker for the cinnamon/sugar  in order to have more control of the amount. Make sure you add the cinnamon/sugar while the are still hot using tongs to turn. I drizzled the chimichangas with caramel syrup.",
