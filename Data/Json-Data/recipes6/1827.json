Perfect when tweaked to decrease sweetness and at least double the apples!

Delicious combination of ingredients, truly hits the spot, especially after I added a bit of natural crunchy peanut butter to my plate while still warm!",

VERY, VERY,  dry recipe.  you absolutely need ice cream or whipped cream with this one. with all the butterscotch I was expecting a butterscotch flavor but did not get any. very crumbly dessert. You're better off just making apple crisp. Will not be making this again. oh and you need to quadruple the amount of apples If I had only used two and a half apples this would be nothing but crumble and no fruit. I used seven apples and it's still wasn't great.",
