That is until I started eating it. So good I cleaned every bite and I confess without shame to picking it up with my fingers and gnawing on the bone to get every bit of it. Soooo tender so flavorful and I don't think the little bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning I seasoned them with or the chicken broth I substituted for the water were make or break additions. I'm confident that with bacon garlic and white wine in the ingredients list I would have been happy with this just as is. I would just say watch the cooking time - I had relatively thick chops and simmering them for just several minutes not 20 as indicated kept them moist and tender and still cooked through. There are so many side dishes that would complement this (the gravy is excellent so buttered noodles immediately comes to mind) but I served this tonight with two other AR recipes Spinach and Rice Alfredo and Mushroom and Bacon Green Beans.",

                "reviewBody": "I really don't get the comments about it not being flavorful but maybe that's because I altered the process a little. It's pretty automatic for me to caramelize my onions for a dish like this so that's what I did first after cooking the bacon. Next I browned the pork chops on one side. I added the garlic when I turned them. Now I made this with some thin pork chops that I happened to have on hand so by that time they were done and I pulled them. the only other change I made was using two pieces of bacon because 1 piece of the bacon I had did not make two tablespoons of grease. If you do something similar you should find it flavorful unless you find anything less flavorful than say buffalo wings bland. My only complaint (which I have often with recipes like this) is that I would've liked it to make a little more sauce. Not everyone likes things as saucy as I I'm sure. No problem next time I will double all the sauce ingredients! Thanks for sharing this we really enjoyed it. FYI it goes great with a beer.",

I followed the instructions to the letter but would cook this differently if I were to make it again. First I'd saute the onions and garlic. And instead of adding the wine to the pan and then putting the lid on it I'd let the wine cook down to get some flavor from it. It was looking pretty anemic so I added a little bit of Kitchen Bouquet which gave it some eye appeal but the flavor still was lacking. Sorry won't be making this again it was a disappointment for us.",
