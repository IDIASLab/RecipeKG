But I did put it on for 16 min instead of 12 - I guess because I made 1 1/2 recipes so I thought it might take longer? I rated it 4 stars for flavor however. Not sure how the other reviewer ended up with dry meat; I had so much liquid and not enough time to reduce it as much as I wanted so it was very stew-like. I used half the sugar which was plenty. What I learned from this recipe was the garlic! Roasting a whole head of garlic (or 1 1/2 in my case) in the oven and then adding it all to the meal was delicious! I probably doubled the ginger which was still mild. I also added more than a little oil - probably 1/3 - 1/2 cup lard. The meat had no fat so it needed it. I don't think this recipe created a time savings over stir-frying since you had to reduce the resulting liquid. Next time I will probably just stir-fry it but keep all that garlic & flavor! My meat came out very tender which was great and I do wonder if I'd need to pressure cook the meat to get it that tender quickly. Perhaps I'll pressure cook the meat and stir-fry everything else when I make it again.",
