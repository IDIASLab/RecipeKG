In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups.  I'm glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup...kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest.  I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy.  After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  I was worried the patties wouldn't get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect!!! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my husband and me.",

I cooked 1/2 batch on the stove and another batch in the oven... preferred the taste of the stove cooked batch, but the oven cooked batch tasted good too.  \n\nThe great disappointment with this recipe was the sauce - it was horrible, to put it kindly!  I followed the advice of others to drastically cut the ketchup - but it didn't do much for the flavor.  It was far from authentic tasting.  I had extra patties and no sauce (not that I would have used the sauce anyway) - the next day I decided to try using Liptons Mushroom and Onion soup mix for the gravy.  I followed the package instructions for making gravy... DELICIOUS!  It was hands down the best tasting sauce for salisbury steak and so simple to make.    \n\nSo, if you're craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don't waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won't regret it!",

I took the following suggestions: I added chopped onion and garlic to meat mixture before browning.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to French onion soup, and mixed in a small amount of brown gravy mix to give it some color and thickened it up a bit.  I omitted the ketchup and doubled the amount to pour on top of garlic mashed potatoes.  For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this as was suggested before.  Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 mins.  Your patties will stay together nicely!!",

Here are the modifications I make each time now (thanks to a compilation of others' suggestions on this site):  1.) Chop up one medium onion (fine) and mix it with the hamburger  2.)  I used 3 TBL Crisco to brown the steaks in the pan (and then drained before I added the gravy 2.) Double the gravy ingredients and omit the ketchup completely 3.) Add 1 can Mushroom Soup, 1 Pkg. Lipton's Dry Onion Soup Mix and 1/2 Cup brown gravy (I use Campbell's most of the time, but any brand works fine).  I prepare the steaks on the stove (don't use the oven as some have suggested), and they turn out perfectly.  Serve with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and Romaine Salad (with dried cherries or cranberries).  Yummy!",
