After reading some of the reviews about dryness I used 2/3 cup of frozen orange juice concentrate and 1/4 cup water.It turned out so moist and flavorful.The combination of orange apricot and chocolate is so tasty. In spite of the changes in liquid ratio I felt it was still crumbly. Next time I will reduce the flour by 1/4 cup and see if that improves on the crumbly texture. Thanks for another delicious recipe Corwynn!",
