I'll admit to experiencing some concern as I am not an intrepid foodie- I like what I like and am not usually open to trying new things. I'm glad I tried this time though because it was really delicious. So I came to A/R looking to see if I could find anything that would be comparable and came across this recipe. It was really quite good! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used red wine instead and chicken stock instead of veggie stock; other than that I kept to the recipe. Another keeper thank you!",

I followed the recipe as written except that I used ground thyme instead of dried. I was really quite nervous about the recipe towards the end. When I added the red pepper flakes it got spicy fast and I thought it was maybe too much for us. Then the vinegar I was very nervous about. I added the first tablespoon stirred and sampled and it had no sour taste and had mellowed the spice of the red pepper flakes. I added the second and a bit of bitterness showed up but definitely not too much. The perfect amount I would say. Kudos to a great recipe.",
