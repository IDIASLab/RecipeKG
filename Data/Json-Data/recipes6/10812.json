I have also reduced the 1/2 cup of white sugar to only 3 tbsp because the apple sauce is sweet naturally. I replaced 3 eggs with only the egg white, buttermilk with low fat milk.  I used 2 cups of carrots and added 1/2 tsp of cloves and nutmeg.",

I had a bag of baby carrots that were starting to get dried up, and wanted to use them up.  I cut the sugar and made muffins instead of a cake.  I only had whole wheat flour on hand, but it was still soft and fluffy.  I also replaced all the fat with a couple heaping spoonfuls of applesauce.  I think whipping the egg whites really made a difference!  I used skim milk because I didn't have any buttermilk.  I sprinkled some shredded coconut, sugar, oats, and cinnamon on top of the muffins.  They're gorgeous, delicious, and super healthy!  I can't wait to try this recipe as written!",
