I just don't like desserts baked with bananas. It just something about bananas baked, just I don't know, the flavors are weird. But give me a banana bread, and we are good to go. SO having said that.. I did have bananas that needed to be used, but I didn't want the \"stand by\" of banana bread. trying different recipes. I saw this and thought...geesh what could happen. What did happen is I fell in love with this breakfast treat. My husband was the same, bread puddings are his fave. I will say, I didn't have day old French bread, but did have an abdunance of different selections, that was getting to that point. Any good yeasted bread will work. And as far as the rest of the recipe, I followed to a T. I love the additon of the spices because they really made the flavor of the banana stand out with the compliments of the cinnamon. And there was no taste lingering from the coconut milk...which I expected to taste. Thank you soo much for the recipe. I was able to use up excess bananas, bread and coconut milk...all in one shot and enjoyed it termendously! No one in my house turned away from asking for seconds.",

The coconut milk was the ingredient that attracted me to this recipe and I couldn t even taste it. I ended up making a rum sauce and poured it over the top for a contrasting flavor.

I read some of the reviews and yes it is very heavy and dense which thats what I expected I make a lot of desserts from Jamaica and a lot of their cakes are dense and heavy which I knew it would be perfect for my husband being from Jamaica. In mine I added raisins and I wanted something sweet tonight so I didn't wait for the next day to bake it I let it sit for an hour before putting it in the oven and it came out perfect.I made me and my husband a bowl of it with some vanilla ice cream and as we started eating it I looked at him and it was so good I wanted to slap him in the face. That's how good it was I didn't have no words at the time lol. This dessert is definitely going into my secret recipe vault and I'm sorry but I'm not going to share it with anyone lol. But I will be making it for all my friends and family and no one's ever going to get this recipe. I'm so happy I came across this recipe it's like totally awesome I ate so much of it my eyes are bulging right now so I need to go sleep this off. when i make banana pudding I always use leftover bread i don't like to use a new loaf so I had some stale bread bread that was the ends of white bread wheat baguette stale hot dog and hamburger rolls.some stale some soft and I just broke it all up in the followed the recipe and it came out perfectly. you can't even tell what is what in the recipe so to me the bread doesn't make a difference.",
