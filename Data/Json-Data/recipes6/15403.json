I added summer sausage olives cubed cheddar cheese and substituted the one green pepper with half of a green and half of a red pepper. The sauce makes enough for 2 lbs instead the one in the recipe (which worked out great since I had a boat load of pasta to make). I loved the tangy sweetness of the dressing. I will definitly be making this salad again!!! Thanks so much for the recipe it's just what I was looking for!!!",

I made this last night following others raters advise I did not use the cup of sugar it called for. I'm so glad I didn't use it as the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough. I also added broccoli and grated sharp cheddar cheese. Refridgerated overnight and had it for lunch today. Very good though very sweet. The dressing was just right not too much not too little not too thick not too thin. My only complaint is that I could have used more broccoli since we love broccoli salad. Update: This made so much that I had my son come by to get a big bowl for his supper. He rated it a 4...said it was too sweet. My hubby rated it a 5. So there you go..it's up to the taste buds. I will make it again though thanks again for the recipe.",
