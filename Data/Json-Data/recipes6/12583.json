Much better!!  Only cooked these 8 minutes which leaves them a tad raw and they stay soft, but we are a \"tad raw cookie\" lovin' family, actually, the dough itself is to die for!  These are great with a rolo candy baked inside, too!  ",

It is rare that cookies make it past a day or two without getting tossed in my house because they become dry, chewy, etc. but these became softer and even more delicious!  Almost a sugar cookie consistency but with peanut butter flavor - yum!",

We baked them 7 minutes for soft cookies and 11 for hard cookies. Thank you...... 1/18/2010...We've made these cookies several times. This has become our favorite PB cookie recipe.
