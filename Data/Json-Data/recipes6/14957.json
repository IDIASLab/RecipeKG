I took the advise of some other reviewers and increased the amount of cheese to 1 1/2 cups and the milk to 1 cup.  I also sprinkled some garlic powder and a touch of cayenne into the batter. 1/4 cup of sugar seemed like a lot for a savory bread so I cut it to 2 tablespoons. Next time I'll cut it to 1 since it was still a little too sweet.  After baking for 20 minutes, I sprinkled about another 1/2 cup of cheese on the top of the loaf, then continued baking.  We all enjoyed this very much with our soup.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Per other recommendations I used 1c milk 1 1/4c sharp cheddar cheese added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and added some Italian seasonings (apprx 1 tsp). I also added 1/4c parmesan cheese. It took a little longer to bake - the top started to brown b4 the middle was done so after 30 min I reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for an additional 10 minutes. The bread had a great crust while the middle was nice and soft. Although it was good like I said just a little too dense for me. If you like cornbread type breads you'd probally enjoy this recipe. My daughter and boyfriend sure did!",
