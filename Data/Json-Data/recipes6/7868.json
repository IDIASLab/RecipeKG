That's why you should try this easy homemade version with real ribs; simply bake, chill, cut, sauce, finish on the grill, and voila! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.",

As an bonus I bought Chef John s SFQ BBQ sauce to try to get it as close to the intended recipe and I think it may be the best BBQ sauce I ve ever had in my life.
