My son has proclaimed that these have passed the test!! He wrapped up better than half the batch and took them home with him Christmas day!!! Personally, I feel that the recipe doesn't make quite as many as mine, but this recipe is easier to handle. The flavor is almost identical to the one I was using with less work and expense which is always good in my opinion. Overall, this is a keeper and will be on my list of Christmas candy in the future.",

Certainly is easy enough to make, only wish the clean-up was that easy.  That sticky sugar-peanut butter mixture solidifies on your pot and spoons and is a bit of a challenge to clean, even in very hot water.  However, they do taste good (sort of like caramel), and I thought they were very filling.  Once you mix in the cereal, you need to move quickly because the mixture starts to thicken and set.  Used non-stick Reynolds Wrap\u00ae and ended up with 23 cookies (almost more like candy).",
