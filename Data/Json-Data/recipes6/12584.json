While incorporating the ingredients better it also breaks down the fat in the product.  To correct this all you need to do is refrigerate you dough for about 5 minutes before baking.  Doing so will re-solidify the fats and stop your cookies from over spreading.  This is the base cookie recipe I use for chocolate chip and other cookies, except I use either butter or half shortnenting and half butter.  It just depends on the product I am making.  You will see a HUGE difference if you try this procedure, guaranteed.",

These were delicious - a little crispy, a little chewy.  I used unsalted butter and next time may reduce the sugar a bit.  I thought 3/4 c M&M added to the batter was a little light, so I added a full cup.  Well, the mixer smashed them up so next time I will mix them in by hand.  Also, will only put 3/4 c in as written; I realized that since you push M&Ms onto the cookies once they are on the sheet, you can control how many candies are in each cookie anyways.  Definitely, absolutely a KEEPER!",

                "reviewBody": "These cookies are fantastic. There are a lot of people giving negative reviews for flat cookies. Unfortunately they aren't educated enough in baking to know when mostly brown sugar is used the cookies tend to be more flat. Which is why you need to use shortening to make up for that. Butter melts faster and therefore makes cookies spread more. I used half butter flavor shortening and half real butter simply for my own tastes not out of necessity. The other thing is chilling the cookie dough for at least 24 hours will enhance the flavor of the cookies and also make the dough easier to work with. Used my tablespoon cookie scoop to make even cookies. I also prefer my cookies slightly under baked so I only cooked them for 8 min. each. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for at least 3 min. otherwise they are too fragile to move. Then transferred to a cookie rack. Also keep in mind if cooling on the cookie sheet there will be carry over cooking which can make the cookies crispier. Thanks for a great recipe! Will be used over and over in this household.",
