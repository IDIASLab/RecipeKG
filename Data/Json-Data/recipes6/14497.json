When I first read the recipe, I thought \"Oh man!  That's going to be too cheesey!\"  But it was excellent!  A little goes a long way.  Since I had already bought graham cracker crumbs for the other recipe, I decided to make a base for this cake using a mixture of crumbs, sugar and melted butter.  Good decision - it tasted great.  I omitted the top layer of ladyfingers and just put the light cherry pie filling right on top of the cheese mixture.  Excellent!",

But I'm giving it 4 stars cause I think would the proper ingredients it would have been okay. Plus mine didn't set? Is that cause I used the wrong cheese and didn't use ladyfingers (I did sub. in some type of soft biscuit which I crumbled)...",

We also omit the lady fingers and use graham cracker crust for top and sides. Thanks for this great recipe! Now our go-to recipe for cheesecake!",
