After the sugar mixture reaches the correct temp (soft ball) remove from heat and wait about ten mins before you beat the whites. After you stream the the sugar mixture into the whites let the mix cool off before you add it to the whipped marshmallow. You can do this by letting it beat on high for up to 12 mins. If not the butter will melt and you may end up with soup. (your looking for about 85degrees. Then I just drop in 2 tbls at a time of room temp butter. If it seems a bit soft (too runny to spread) just place the whole mix in the fridge for 5 mins. and whip again. But be careful not to let it build condensation while in the fridge or the whole thing will collapse.",

                "reviewBody": "Very good!! I cut the recipe in 1/3 and still came out with a very good 2 layer cake. Added a little more sugar and substituted the coconut-water instead of plain old water. Had a bit of trouble too like the review above with the icing but all in all it still came out yummy. Here's a hint on how to use fresh coconut (I had to do a bit of research!) Crack coconut open carefully you can do this with a screwdriver and a hammer into one of the \"eyes\" and pour out & save the coconut water. Once you have the coconut in large pieces (halves more or less) put them on a cookie sheet in an oven heated to 250 for 10-15 minutes. This will make the meat loosen up a bit from the shell and easier to get out. You'll still probably have to pry. Then there is another layer of brown skin you'll have to slice off with a paring knife before you throw the meat into the food processor.:) It's a little bit of work but definitely worth it in the end.",

There are good hints below about making the old fashioned cooked frosting which I followed which was really tasty! It turned out perfect.

                "reviewBody": "The instructions for this recipe are off. The ingredient list calls for 1 cup of milk then never states what to do with it. I know the directions stated to top off the coconut water to equal one cup so I figured that's what that 1 cup of milk was for...but it's not. You have to add it to the cake batter or it comes out tasting like flour and is dry. The icing is terrible. I spent half the afternoon shelling and grating a fresh coconut then having to remake the icing using my own recipe for cream cheese frosting only for it all to taste like a load of except for my frosting. Do not make this it's not worth the hassle. The recipes using a white cake mix are much better.",
