Normally I make as written but I had a mix of organic veggies that included several different types of radishes, a couple of turnip varieties, as well as yellow and orange carrots. Made this as written using those veggies and the flavor and cook time was spot on. Everything got a nice even browning/roast and I couldn't have been happier with the end result. Perfect!
