The recipe called for plenty of blueberries so there was at least one in every bite which made the muffins a bit sweeter. The recipe does not tell you how far to fill the liners so I went with 3/4's of the way. I wound up with 16 muffins that were quite small since they did not rise very much. Next time I will fill to the top. Thank you for the recipe.",
