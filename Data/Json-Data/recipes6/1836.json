Cut the parsnips into the size of the halved brussels sprouts (or slightly smaller, so they'll all get done at the same time). I added another white onion, and the two onions caramelized quite nicely. I used convection, so everything cooked perfectly at only 35 minutes. I used about 2 T of fresh thyme as I had extra, and that was great. It wasn't overpowering as thyme is mild to begin with. I made my own balsamic vinaigrette from scratch (whisk together: 4 T EVOO, 2 T balsamic vinegar, a chopped garlic glove, salt/pepper). Don't forget the brown sugar as that helped a lot with the caramelization and that perfect \"burn.\" It took only 2 of us adults to finish the dish. Would lick the plate again!",
