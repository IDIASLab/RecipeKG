Resting afterwards was a must for them to hold together when picking up. Definitely a keeper!",

Because it\u2019s not quite time for the Grinch, we made monster cookies and I\u2019m so thrilled with how they turned out! We chilled the dough for 3-4 hours before baking because I\u2019m my experience I\u2019ve noticed vegan cookies spread a lot if not chilled.  We used Duncan Hines white cake mix and vanilla pudding mix, and added a few drops of green food coloring.  They\u2019re very moist and my 4 year old is ecstatic!",
