The only change I made was using the 4 teaspoons of baking powder in place of the cream of tartar and baking soda. I let the dough set Fridge overnight. I too rolled the cookies between 2 sheets of parchment paper (you could use wax paper) and only had to use a dusting of powder on the paper and on the dough and had no trouble at all with the cut outs sticking or the dough being too sticky(?). Baked them for 7 minutes.....no longer. They were perfect.  This is my new sugar cookie recipe that I am sure I will use forever.",

This was definately a wonderful sugar cookie!!  (Also, it was exactly 8 minutes to make them just right!! )  I also used real butter instead of margarine!",

Had no trouble rolling them out and cutting them with cookie cutters, and they baked up beautifully.  I've never made successful sugar cookies before, but these were perfect.  I rolled the cookies fairly thin since I knew they would puff up a bit, so I ended up getting more than 6 dozen heart shaped cookies.  Very popular at work and with my family.  Thanks for this one!!",
