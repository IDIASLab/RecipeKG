With a few small modifications: I used 2 large leeks (white & green parts) 3 medium potatoes and substituted one cup table cream in place of one cup chicken broth.

Rather than tasting the combined flavors it is more like tasting the apple leek and curry all at the same time...very neat! You will need to experiment with the size of the 2 apples and 3 leeks...the balance of flavors is easily swayed based on not only the quantity but also the strength of the leek and the ripeness of the apple. There is a lot of leeway before you go too far one way or the other though: don't let it worry you but make a note if you think it goes too far one way or the other when you make it the first time. Overall quite easy very tasty and hearty!",
