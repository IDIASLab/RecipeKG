I reduced both sugars to 3/4 c. each, and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  After mixing, the batter seemed a bit dry, so I put in a tad more oil.  Very good flavor, and the texture is great - somehow they are chewy, crispy, and soft all at the same time.  The first pan I cooked a full 12 minutes; these came out kind of crunchy, but still a little chewy, and very good.  The second and subsequent pans, I cooked more like 9-10 minutes (took them out just before they looked done), let them cool on the pan for 2 minutes.  These were our favorites.  Delicious recipe and a bit healthier using oil vs. butter.  Thanks for sharing it.",

The trick is not to overbake them and to let them cool a bit before removing from pan. I gave these out to neighbors and friends this year for Christmas.

I tend to find oatmeal cookies lacking something and I think I know what it is. The oats need to be toasted (I toasted very slowly in a dry non-stick pan until golden brown). I also toasted the coconut.  I used 2 eggs equivalent in egg whites and subbed 1/4 c applesauce for 1/4c oil. They are very sticky and hard to roll at first but once in the fridge and cooled down they are much easier to work with. I am also freezing some dough, I will let you know how it turns out. I think I cooked them for a bit longer than called for but I like my cookies crisper. They turned out crispy on the egdges and chewy and moist in the middle. I will be making these on a regular basis. THANK YOU!!\nThe dough froze well, I rolled the log shaped dough in parchment paper and then Saran wrap and put it in a Ziploc freezer bag. Let it defrost in the fridge and baked them sliced right off the log. Still very good!",
