If it's thicker, you can use the amount called for. Also, decrease the ranch dressing if you use more buffalo hot sauce.  Great flavor. Don't skip the celery topping. I made thin slices and topped each egg with that and a sprinkle of cayenne. Yummy, easy, and different.",

I made a second batch with half the ranch and double the buffalo sauce and they had much better flavor and consistency. I also feel these need salt to bring out the flavors. Not sure what was intended by cutting the celery in \u201ctiny stalks\u201d, but I just did some thin slices and that worked out great. A tiny bit of crumbled blue cheese on top would have been a nice touch.",
