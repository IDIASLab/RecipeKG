I used canned oysters and was very happy with how tender and flavorful they were. The recipe didn't specify when to add the liquid from the oysters so I just added it when I added the veggie cooking liquid and milk. Season with salt and pepper and all of the flavors come together beautifully. This is a very tasty simple soup that I will be making again and again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I had canned oysters and creamed corn that were expiring and so looked this up in order to use them. I also added carrots, cauliflower and celery, used 2% milk, and used coconut oil and butter for the roux. This is a seriously good recipe that lends itself to modifications, quick and easy. I will be trying with fresh oysters in the future.",
