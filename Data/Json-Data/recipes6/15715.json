I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 tsp. as my bread machine has a tendency to make the bread overrise and I used 1-1/2 tsp. of bread machine yeast. I liked the addition of the dry milk powder which contributes softness and helps keep the bread fresh. I also like that this recipe does not call for a lot of butter or oil.
