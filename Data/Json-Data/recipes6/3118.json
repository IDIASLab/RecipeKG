I used a jalape\u00f1o that I cut in half and seeded I took it out before serving so I just got the right amount of heat with no surprises. After the meat onion pepper mixture was cooked I tossed in the cabbage to cook it a bit then added the lime juice mixture and cooked it all together. After everything was well mixed and the cabbage a little cooked I removed the jalape\u00f1o and threw it away. Then topped it with the chopped mint cilantro and raw onion slices.",

Instead of the bowl I just thinly sliced about 3/4 of a small red cabbage and ended up adding it to the cooked beef mixture and letting it cook slightly for about 3-5 minutes. I used grapeseed oil for the dressing/sauce as well as coconut palm sugar of which I used about 1 TBs after tasting as I find it's less sweet than brown sugar. I also subbed parsley for cilantro as DH hates it and 1 deseeded chopped jalape\u00f1o which I cooked with the onion. I am sure I'll make this one again so thanks for sharing a great recipe Sahara B!",
