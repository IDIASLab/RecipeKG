DH & I might have liked a little more zip but it still had a nice flavor and the kids liked it. I added some chopped smoked turkey from my freezer and about 1 cup of black beans along with the corn and picante sauce. I also used a bit less corn than called for. This is a very rich dish but a nice winter warmer. Leftovers the next day were very good too. The second time I made this I wanted to use my crock pot. I combined all ingredients from step one in the crock and cooked for several hours. I did the cream cheese step an hour or so before serving. It worked great.",

Next time I might add some shredded chicken or a can of black or northen beans but I made it as is (with the exception of using additional corn) and it was great! I had no problems with the cream cheese and it was great in this soup. Will make this again and again! Thanks Cathy!",
