I got on my computer to find a \"recipe brown edge sugar cookies\" thinking it would turn up nothing since the subject was too long and that I would probably end up on a porn site. I could not have been more wrong but to find this Heavenly recipe for the best sugar cookies I ever made. I checked the larder and found: No butter! Since my wife is at work my son is at the \"Y\" and I being legally blind (unable to drive) I sought out a substitute. Aha! One stick of margarine and the scrapings in an old can of Crisco. I quickly combined the ingredients thinking that even though they would not exactly be up to snuff I would eat anything with flour and sugar. I went back to the television to await the cooling period. Exactly 1/2 hour later I pulled the dough from the fridge and started the ball rolling so to speak. Oh my! To my dismay the dough was so soft but I continued on anyway. 10 minutes later I checked the oven to see to my surprise 6 inch sugar cookies with perfect brown edges. I let them cool for a few minutes then let them set on brown paper. The only problem was 12 cookies on that sheet was too many and the edges were imperfect. So what is any good baker to do? Yup I ate the first dozen and they were heavenly. When I finish I will take a picture of them and post it here. I can't wait to get some butter.",

Although the end result was very tasty the dough was EXTREMELY difficult to work with. First 20 minutes of chilling did nothing for it - I had to wait several hours before it was at a workable state. Even then and taking only small bits at a time the dough was still so soft and sticky that rolling was exasperating and very difficult. Once finally rolled and cut it was so soft that I could not get a single cookie up and onto the cookie sheet without being squished into a little ball. The addition of more flour did not help and I didn't want to continue to add more for fear of a tough end result. I did two completely separate batches with the same exact results so it wasn't just a fluke. Bottom line - tastes great but way too hard to work with. I'll keep looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe.",
