Second I scaled down some of the ingredients a little bit. I only used 2 packages of cream cheese 1 1/2 cups sugar 1 tablespoon cornstarch 2 eggs and about 3/4 cups of sour cream. The rest of the ingredients I left as is. In addition I also added fresh lime and orange juice along with the lemon for more citrus flavor. Turned out great! Thanks!",

I topped it with the marmalade glaze from the recipe. It turned out just beautiful. I always cook my cheesecakes in a water bath. I will definately make this one again.",

For the topping I couldn\"t find a marmalade made with seville oranges at the nearby store so I was stuck using smuckers which usually does really well with their products but in the case of orange marmalade is really way too sweet so I just added a whole lot of lemon juice and reduced it for quite a while...it tasted excellent! Loads if citrus flavor instead of corn syrup! My friend who loves cheesecake and orders it out regularly said it was the best he's ever had! Just made again (this time with higher quality marmalade:)) and the response was overwhelming!!! Another friend who loves cheesecake tried it and said \"Oh my gosh you are going to make me so fat! This is unlike anything I've ever tasted before.....yum!!!!\" Last weekend I had made the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake for this friend which he also really liked but definately not any more than this one!",
