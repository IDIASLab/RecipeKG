Added 1/2 cup sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar let out the ginger and added 1 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 tablespoon flour and baked in a spring form pan like a regular cheesecake. I think next time I will try adding an additional package of cream cheese and a little more pumpkin pie spice just to get a little more cheese flavor. Thanks for the idea!",

I also baked it in a single deep dish crust instead of 2 regular. It was very good even our non-diabetic friends enjoyed it. It was very fluffy and light and had a nice smooth consistency. We added a dollop of sugar free cool whip and a few chopped pecans before serving. I will definitely make this recipe again.",
