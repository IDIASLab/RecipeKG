The recipe doesn't call for cheese but there's cheese in the picture. Baked it in a 2 quart casserole as instructed. Celery wasn't done. That said even with crunchy celery it had a wonderful and very unique flavor. Instead of casserole it totally looked like soup. Green tomato soup! Even so flavor was awesome. In an effort to try to make it into a \"casserole \" I added some pasta and cooked it in a pan on top of the stove. Pasta absorbed most of the excess liquid and the celery softened up too. I'd for sure make this again. There's NO WAY to describe the blend of flavors. I'm just perplexed HOW to serve it. Is it a side dish a soup what! With addition of pasta it did make a side dish. It's VERY unique and very good! I'll make it again.",

Half way through the baking time I sprinkled with 1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup panko breading This gave a nice crunchy topping. I didn't have celery or green onions so substituted green pepper and yellow onion. I think any mix of mild flavored vegetables would work well for this recipe.",
