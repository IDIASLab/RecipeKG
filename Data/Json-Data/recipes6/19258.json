I prefer to slowly start the jam on a low heat with the frozen berries. When you do this there is no need to add water as enough juice will be released by the thawing berries to produce a slightly thicker jam. To bump up the flavour and texture as well as extend your berries you can add up to an equal amount of peeled chopped apple which is excellent. This berry is absolutely beautiful used in muffins loaves/cakes pies as a substitute for cranberries in sauces served with turkey etc. An interesting aside is that lingonberries are the best plant food source of vitamin D! This berry is a staple in my neck of the woods.",
