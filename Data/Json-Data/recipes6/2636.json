Call them a biscuit call them a scone just call them to your kitchen real soon. I made as directed but froze the butter and grated into the flour. The dough is very sticky even after chilling so I decided to just pat it into a round score into eight pieces with a bench knife and bake on a silpat lined baking sheet. Note to self - try using 1/4 cup heavy cream instead of water - I bet that would be amazing. If serving as a sweet sprinkle with course grained sugar. The addition of some cinnamon and or nutmeg would be great.",
