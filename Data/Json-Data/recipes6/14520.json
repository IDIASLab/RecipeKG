Very hot, be careful.

Dressing was tasty with just the right amount of sweetness for the salad. I served the dressing on the side. I added mandarin oranges, red onion and pecans!!!! Great salad!!!! Thanks Jerry.\nUpdate: I tried the dressing with the raspberry balsamic vinegar and it was wonderful. I did increase the vinegar to a half cup and reduced the sugar in half. I think it could have used more sugar, but it was still a wonderful dressing and salad. I continue to add mandarin oranges, pecans and red onions. Great Salad!!!",

I followed the recipe exactly.\n\nFirst, it wasn't until I got into the recipe that I realized that this recipe took everything that was healthy about raw spinach and strawberries and turned it into a complete heart attack equating to McDonald's food on a bad day.\n\nLiterally, you are putting 1 full cup of super high fat oil mixed with sugar all over some healthy raw spinach and good healthy sweet fruit.  \n\nNormally when I eat spinach salad, which is daily, I can eat a full plate of raw spinach with about 2 teaspoons of Italian dressing.  The whole thing is under 200 calories.  This recipe is immensely high fat and high sugar.\n\n Anyhow, I could only eat about 4 bites until I felt like \"ugg\".  I'm laying back now with my sugar rush feeling bad.  If I eat plain raw spinach with Italian, I feel like a million bucks.\n\nI would highly consider re-doing this recipe.  The strawberries are a very nice touch, but all the sugar is a nightmare.\n\nThis is my opinion, and I do feel that we as a society eat way too much sugar.  This recipe is an example of how something very healthy is turned into a completely unhealthy meal.\n\nI'm sorry, but I did think the flavor itself is 4 to 5 stars, but then again, oil + sugar taste good with anything.  Just like fried anything tastes good.",
