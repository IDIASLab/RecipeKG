I tossed the asparagus with the soy sauce mixture right on a foil-lined cookie sheet, and roasted for 10 minutes at 425 degrees. I initially wasn't going to add the brown sugar but it was such a small amount I decided to after all. You really can't taste it, but I do believe it served to tame the somewhat bitter taste asparagus can sometimes have and mellow it out.  I loved the combination of flavors here--just make sure you don't confuse toasted sesame oil, which is basically a finishing oil, with regular sesame oil, or a lot of flavor will be forfeited.  ",

(For the stringbeans - I first snip off a corner of the bag, microwave it for 9 minutes then i put it into an oven-proof dish, pour the marinade on top and roast for about 30 minutes - until the top stringbeans wilt a bit.

I was able to get it nice and tender and still enjoy the tips and enjoy the FLAVOR. Since it cooked the flavors in in the pan as opposed to dripping them out and soaking up the smoke on the grill.
