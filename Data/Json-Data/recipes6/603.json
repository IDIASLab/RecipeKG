        "description": "This turkey brine will impart incredible flavor to your bird and keep it moist no matter how long you cook it. The allspice berries give this recipe a unique and wonderful flavor, so depending on how much of this flavor you want, you can add more or less berries. Kosher salt is the best option for any brine, but if you don't have any on hand, substitute the 1 1/4 cup of kosher salt for 1 cup of table salt. I once used this to brine a turkey that took 7 hours to cook, and it was still one of the most moist and juicy turkeys I ever made. This recipe will make enough to cover up to a 17 pound turkey.",

However my turkey was moist and tasty so I figure it probably did what it was supposed to do. A quick warning though.... \"Ready in about 1 1/4 hours\" is WAY off! I \"set aside to cool completely\".... In fact it sat on my deck in 40 degree weather to cool down and after 4 hrs it was still close to 60 degrees. Not a temp to start brining a turkey! Make this WAY ahead of time and allow to cool. Don't wait until the last minute.",
