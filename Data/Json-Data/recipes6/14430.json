I tried chopping up my cranberries in my blender and that was a miserable failure so I resorted to using my hand-food processer and that worked great! I used Strawberry Jello instead of raspberry and it was perfect. This recipe makes a LOT of salad.. I had a huge amount left over in the fridge (we have a small family) but I kept munching on it all week.. it stays fresh for a long time! I will definitely make this again.",
