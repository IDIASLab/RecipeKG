I added milk and a bit more water and cornstarch as necessary to re-thicken the sauce. Eventually I found a yummy beef flavor that wasn't overpowering. I also cooked the meat/onion mixture as suggested and the meat was a bit on the tough side! not necessarily the fault of the recipe creator but perhaps this recipe needs to be the slow cook method (either crockpot or low temp in stove for hours etc)! I'm overall happy with the final product but I definitely recommend adjusting the sauce to taste as you're cooking!",
