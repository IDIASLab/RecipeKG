If I were to make it again (and I probably will just find another similar recipe instead) I would cut the sugar down dramatically to less than half the amount in this recipe. I would add some heat more garlic and something to jazz it up. As written this recipe is just boring.",

I've never seen a Mongolian dish with carrots before but they were delicious. I would have given it 4.5 if possible. The author's description in my opinion is a little deceptive. It isn't \"crispy\" chicken it's only saut\u00e9ed and it isn't really \"sweet and sour\" because there isn't anything sour in it. Maybe that's why one reviewer thought it was too sweet. My family thought it was just right. Next time I would use three tablespoons of corn starch because the sauce was pretty thin. We are cutting back on carbs so I didn't serve rice that would have helped to soak up the sauce. I did serve it with bok choy onions and garlic stir fried and very lightly steamed. Lo Mein noodles would be really delicious with it.",
