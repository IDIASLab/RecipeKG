I've made it several times and I've made these adjustments...First I crisp the bacon and drain it so the dish isn't so greasy then I cut the sugar WAY back to 1/4 of a cup. In a pinch I used an apple instead of a tomato and it was PERFECT. For a full meal I also chop up sausage and mix in with the kraut/apple mixture. Just awesome!",
