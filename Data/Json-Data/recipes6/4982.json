I couldn't find coriander at the store and misread the recipe and only bought one container of veggie broth so added filled up the container with water figuring I'd add boullion if it needed more. It was super great without. My family gobbled it up and asked why we can't eat this everyday.:) I also trimmed the dried stalk ends and cut up the stalk and put them in the soup with the broth and they got nice and tender like celery. It was a nice touch. This meal is well balanced and anyone needing an iron kick and is sick of steak this is the recipe for you! Thanks for sharing. Will make again!",
