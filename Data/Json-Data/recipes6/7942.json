The star in this applesauce and the single thing that makes it distinctive and delicious is the star anise. It doesn t overpower but it is the first flavor that you taste and it does make you wonder what is that? I love finding new recipes that I can make in the Instant Pot and this will be my go-to recipe in the future. I used MacIntosh apples and cut back a little on the brown sugar (personal taste preference). Thanks for sharing your recipe we really enjoyed it.",
