The marshmallows folded into the batter totally  melted helping to keep the cake moist but didn't interfere with the blondie \"texture,\" and the strawberries give just enough sweetness.  I made a few substitutions using Egg Beaters\u00ae and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend\u00ae but kept the measurements in the correct proportion.  I did think 1 Tbsp of vanilla would be overpowering, so I cut that in half.    Experimenter, this is a very nice blondie recipe, and thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it!",

When you slice it it doesn't really stay together and kinda falls apart. It tastes nice but it's kinda messy and not in the ooey gooey way. More like it just kinda spongy and plop. I definitely do not understand where the photo came from because they do not look like that in real life! And I have baking experience so it isn't like I don't know how to follow a recipe and so it looks like blurg. So I think it was ok. I'd not make it again. It's also very sweet! But I can forgive that in most things. I posted photos so there's a better idea of what it looks like. It also took way longer than the recipe said to cook and ended up still underdone in the center while being overdone on top. And I know it wasn't the oven either. Sad.",

I wasn't a fan of the texture of the marshmallows on top but that wasn't too bad. The blondies were very moist and had a good flavor so I'll probably make them again. The strawberries gave them a little something special that makes them stand out from a lot of recipes. They're not as dense as a typical brownie/blondie but they're denser than cake. They could be eaten by hand but it's easier to eat them with a fork.",
