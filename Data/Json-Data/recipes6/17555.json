I used graduated round cookie cutters for the middle hole and outer circle. Also we like to eat this cookie soft so after frosting them I put them in a cookie tin overnight with a piece of bread. Then the next day the cookies are soft and chewy. Thanks for the recipe my husband kids and I love it!",
