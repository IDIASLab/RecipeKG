The cookies are moist and delicious and there's no taste of the applesause at all. I was intrigued by the addition of coffee liqueur and it does add an extra dimension to the flavor that the Toll House recipe doesn't have. These were very tasty but I only gave 4 stars because I have a soft spot for the nostalgia of the regular Toll House recipe (these are the cookies my mom always had for us when I was growing up- there's nothing that beats that!) ADDITIONAL INFO 2/26/06- these cookies got hard the very next day EVEN THOUGH I HAD THEM IN TUPPERWARE!- So I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4",
