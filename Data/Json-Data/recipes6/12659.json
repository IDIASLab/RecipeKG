I followed the recipe perfectly and my 2nd batch needed alteration and still didnt turn out anything like an outmeal-raisin cookie. The cookies came out like mini-cakes. and my Husbands only response was a wierd facial expression and the Question \"are you sure these arent gingerbread cookies?\". Maybe they would be better baking in a pan but then maybe it should havebeen called \"Mini-Oatmeal & Raisin Gingerbread cakes\". As for the Oatmeal you could barely even notice there was Oatmeal in it it seems that the proportions of the ingrediets are all wrong and yes I triple checked everything written here. My advice: try a practise batch first and see what you think.",

Even though I chilled the dough they spread like crazy and turned out as flat as poker chips. I do like a chewy cookie but these were actually goopey. I had to cool them for the longest time before I could get them off the sheet without falling apart and I had to bake them for much longer then the suggested 12 minutes. Maybe I did something wrong; my daughter Ash was going for an MRI today so I was a little preoccupied but I believe I followed the instructions correctly. Sorry!:)",
