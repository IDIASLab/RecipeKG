I kept all other ingredients the same sans the apricots which I omitted. I did add salt to the marinade. The onion was overpowering after it had sat in the yogurt overnight and I used a medium onion cut into chunks. Personal choice but I prefer to make a marinade out of the \"Mixed Grill of Sausage Chicken and Lamb With Tandoori Flavorings\". All said it did make the lamb very tender and I was very glad to try a South African recipe. Thanks!",

I gradually add in more curry powder and sugar until I like the taste. Only adding the suggested amount of curry and sugar is not enough to give the marinade a good flavor. If you're able to find Cape Malay curry powder try it in the marinade it's the best. I find that thinner pieces of onion work best for the recipe.
