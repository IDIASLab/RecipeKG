I was a little concerned when I was mixing the batter since the consistency was a little gooey but it was great in the end. the sour cream really makes the cookies light and fluffy. Next time I make these I will use a bigger bowl to mix in medium was too small. the dough spattered when I mixed all the flour (one cup at a time) in. The icing was easier to work with once it cooled down and became thicker. I will add a little more orange peel zest to the icing next time just for a stronger flavor. Otherwise this recipe is a keeper.",
