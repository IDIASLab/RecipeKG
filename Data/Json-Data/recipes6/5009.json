        "description": "There are many brines available for your holiday turkey, and many have similar ingredients. The basic concept is that brining a turkey, or any meat, helps that meat retain moisture over long cooking periods. My husband said this recipe created the juiciest turkey he had ever experienced. Even after almost 4 hours of cook time, you could squeeze the juice out of the meat it was so tender and juicy. And the savory and sweet flavors were just enough to complement the brine and impart those flavors to the turkey. Bon appetit!",
