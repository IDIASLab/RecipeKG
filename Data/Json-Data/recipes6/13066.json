So this time I made a few necessary changes. First these require a bit more flour than the recipe calls for so I used about 2 1/4 cups of flour instead of just 2 cups. Next the recipe doesn't call for any baking soda (which it needs) and these spread perfectly with 1 t. of bking soda added. The other change I made was the sugar. Instead of 1 C of white sugar I used 1/2 C white sugar and 3/4 C brown sugar. These changes made this cookie perfect all around. They are soft and yummy and the chocolate and orange together are a great combo!",
