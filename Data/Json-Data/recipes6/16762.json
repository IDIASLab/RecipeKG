It's great and doesn't mess with your insulin or blood sugar level. (course the pinapple juices will but hey..) Making punch with the drippings isn't optional just so you know. I'ts fabulous. Mix it with homemade lemonade for a summery treat! You can adjust the marshmallow content to your liking. If you and yours arent crazy about 'those' salads packed with marshmallows cut back. They're not really good for ya anyhow. And do use real cream don't desecrate this recipe with miraclewhip or anything like that. The fat is not really bad for you read the book: \"The protein power lifeplan\" for good basic nutrition research. You'll be glad you did. (Look around; does america seem to have 'nutrition' down pat?) Good luck with the salad! It's yummy!",

I substituted a 1 pound bag of tart frozen cherries and followed the rest of the directions (omitting the nuts as my family requested). It turned out wonderfully! Just in time for Valentine's Day and Presidents Day when cherries are so popular. I put a small bowl of coarsely chopped walnuts on the table for anyone who wished to add the crunch of nuts. This was a hit. I have added it to my keepers. Thanks Chandell!",

On thanksgiving I poured a bottle of lemon up the drained juice and ice cubes into a punch bowl. I also placed about five slices of fresh lemon and three slices of fresh lime in with it. I had so many compliments! The salad was wonderful too and I did NOT cut the sugar. I did cut the marshmallows though about in half. It all depends on your tastes.
