Celery tends to be pretty boring on its own, but I love that this soup really highlights the celery flavor and makes it the star of the show. Unfortunately, the finished product was a little bland, however that was easily solved by adding more salt (I used 1 teaspoon total) and pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon total). I used an immersion blender to get things nice and smooth. I can't imagine a hand mixer being very efficient, as suggested in the directions. I served the soup topped with garlic croutons, which I highly recommended; they added some texture and great flavor.",

I added about a quarter tsp. each of oregano, thyme, dry mustard, and a bay leaf. I had a couple of carrots so I diced and added those as well. \n\nDespite sauteing the veggies as written, unfortunately it needed a LOT more time. I put it on for 11 minutes, and it was pretty crispy still. Another 10, and still firm. Another 10 did the trick. Next time I'd pressure cook for at least 25 minutes. I'll make it again with the added time and more spices.",
