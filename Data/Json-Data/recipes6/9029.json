Canned beans hold too much moisture and are already too soft to pull any kind of \"crisp\" off. Like I said the flavor is good but I think the only way to pull this off successfully is to cook up some dried beans beforehand under cook them a bit and let them drain really really well before you ever begin. I saw some complaints about the marinated artichokes but this is what I used and I have no complaints there at all.",
