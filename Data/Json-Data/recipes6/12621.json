If you're going to roll it in confectioner's sugar put a thick layer to get that bright white spotted look otherwise it just cooks into the cookie. Once I tasted the cooked cookie I remember a packaged cookie that's very similar in taste but had that granulated sugar with the slightly bigger chrystals on it. That's the route I'm going next time for these super tasty cookies!",
