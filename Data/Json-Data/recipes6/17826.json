I mixed them all together in a bowl and let them macerate for a few minutes, then placed them in the crust and baked.  The cherries held together better this way and the juices still made a nice gel to hold it all together.  I'd suggeset cooking the pie a little longer, though, if you do it this way, because you aren't starting with a hot filling.",

It's off the charts great and you almost hear a heavenly choir as you taste the perfect flavors.  But the key to this recipe is to replace the crust.  Look up a totally different recipe for the crust.  This crust has good flakiness, but is so very bland that it detracts from the superb filling.  My family ate the filling and scraped the crust away to avoid that part - even with the cinnamon and sugar I sprinkled on top to combat it.  No, you can't salvage it by adding a little this and that. Trust me, you do not want this crust at all.  BUT - The filling is the BEST!  It has such great flavor!  Can't say enough good about that!  I am adopting the filling as my permanent cherry filling recipe.  Mmmmmm....",

If you are using anything but sour cherries I suggest you reduce the sugar to about 3/4 cup. Also if you are using pure almond extract versus immitation almond extract I suggest adding only 1/8 tsp as using 1/4 tsp overpowered everything else. I suggest putting about 1/4 Cup of the 3/4 cups sugar directly on the bottom crust with about 1Tbs flour and cook your pie on 450 for about 15 mins and then reduce heat for the remainder of the cooking time. This allows the sugar to caramelize on the bottom and prevent a soggy bottom crust. I do this with all my fruit based pies. Note that if you do this then that leaves 1/2 Cup sugar for the filling. Last but not least I agree with other reviewers that you don't need to cook/boil the filling before hand. Just toss the cherries with almond extract, sugar and cornstarch let sit 10 mins and add to pie crust. It will boil in the pie while cooking and will not be liquid at all (make sure you allow enough time for cooling down though)",

It was a little too sweet for my tastes but that is something that varies widely among different people. I would only suggest tasting the mixture as you are adding the sugar if you prefer more a more tart cherry pie.",
