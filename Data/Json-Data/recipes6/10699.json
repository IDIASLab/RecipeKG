I prefer to make it without the topping, but it is just as good with it. The longer you are able to refrigerate it before serving the better it gets.  Enjoy!",

It sounds kind of gross but it is very good especially w/ chocolate!). There is also Sour Supreme Better Than Sour Cream you can use for the topping if you want. But like others I left it off.
