I had slightly less than 1 full cup of pecans, & I also added a dash of vanilla...otherwise I used the quantities listed. I cooked it on medium heat for 3 mins, then lowered the heat & cooked for 2 more mins. It tastes fantastic & the texture is exactly right. I let it cool for about 5 mins before icing my cake. I would likely double the recipe for a layered cake, but there was plenty for the bundt cake. This recipe was quick, easy, & delicious! I will use it again & again. Thank you for the recipe!",

This was my first attempt at this type of frosting & I wasn't super clear on how long it should take to reach different stages other than what was written which was a little vague. Ended up cooking until it was as described (thicker & bubbly) but it took longer than the 3 minutes described. Since I only have store/bakery versions to compare to, this set up a little more solidly than I would have preferred & I ended up adding a few drops of milk to make it more pliable & easy to work with. Overall, definitely would recommend giving this a shot based on the simple ingredients, ease of preparation & flavor. It is a pretty tasty frosting & the solidity may have been in part to my inexperience; thanks for sharing!",
