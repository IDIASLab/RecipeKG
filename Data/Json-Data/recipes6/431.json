The small changes I made were to use ground turkey which I cooked in fajita seasoning with a little chicken broth and olive oil.  Then I tossed the turkey mixture into the crock pot with the onions and the rest of the ingredients (did not use water and for beans I used one can of pinto, one can of black beans and one can of cannelini).  I also used one can of Ro*Tel with habanero and cayenne pepper with sea salt to taste.  After 30 minutes, I mixed the chili up then let it cook about 3 and half hours (you could do 8 hours but it isn't necessary).  It turned out so good the husband says I could win a chili competition with it!  Thanks for posting a great recipe!",

The batch with the beans I had to substitute the ground chicken for stew meat.  The second and no beans chili, I used ground beef.  I did amp up the spices to taste.  This was a fabulous recipe.  Both chili's came out most holy delicious!!!!  3 hrs high was perfect time in the crock pot for both.  I'm so glad I tried this and know I will be making this again and again!!!!

I'm not saying it was bad just not outstanding.\" So I'll make and eat just about any variety of chili and some blow me away some are OK but w/ a sprinkle of cheese some fritos and a squirt of Siracha sauce I'm usually happy. This particular chili (which I followed as written except using ground beef instead of chicken) was tasty but not one that I think I'd make again perhaps due to the vinegar/brown sugar taste I'm not sure what it was but it didn't satisfy my chilitch.",

I enjoyed that it was a little bit different from the normal chili that I make. The chili powder gives it just the right amount of kick!
