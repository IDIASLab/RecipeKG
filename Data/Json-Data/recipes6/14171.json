My search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie began and ended with this recipe!!! These are ideal...slightly crispy around the edges and wonderfully chewy in the centre. I used cold butter when making these and had no problems with them being too flat. A truly gourmet cookie is not \"puffy\" anyway. As for cookies sticking to the baking sheet might I suggest parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Also do as indicated in the recipe and allow cookies to cool for the specified time on the baking sheet. One more thing I found these were the best when cooked between 8-9 minutes. Wendy these are restaurant quality cookies and my family says a big THANK YOU!!!",

They're not made with shortening (a plus; no transfats) & they hold up well after they've cooled down.  Thanks again, Wendy!\nJan 26, 2004: Of the chocolate chip cookie recipes I've tried so far on this website, this one is my fave.  They have buttery-crisp edges, and that is the way I like them.  I only used one kind of chip (milk chocolate for DSD's sake), and one kind of nut (pecans); but the cookie itself is of the texture that I like.  They're addicting!  Thanks, Wendy.",

That's what I Love so much about these. They smell like a fudge shop on Mackinac Island on a cool Autumn afternoon. I read in another review to omit baking powder to make them less cakey-textured so I did that. And I had to omit all nuts because I have a very picky fiance but there will be time to add nuts as I will be making these for the rest of my life.",
