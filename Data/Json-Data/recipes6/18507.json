                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this 4 stars because the original recipe does need a little help. First of all the orange juice and zest contain nowhere near enough flavor to make this cheesecake taste orange-y at all. I suggest using a teaspoon or two of orange extract as well. I added all the orange flavors to the white batter only. I reserved the two cups for the chocolate before I added them so the chocolate and orange would contrast nicely. The crust is great. Be sure you let your cream cheese and eggs sit out until they are at room temp or you'll over beat the batter trying to get the lumps out. Over beating leads to all kinds of cheesecake problems! Anyway lined my springform pan with foil and baked my cheesecake in a water bath. I had no structural or textural problems except for a few bubbles from slightly over beating. After it was done (60 min) I turned off the oven and let it cool for an hour inside. Then I took it out and let it cool completely on a wire rack. I chilled the cake overnight. I removed the hoop and bottom of the pan (tricky) and scored the top of the cake into 12 even portions. Garnished it with whipped cream from a pastry bag with a large star tip chocolate filigree and orange twists. I also served it with the Marmalade Drizzle from the Orange Pudding Cakes with Marmalade Drizzle recipe from this site as a sauce. It was a perfect addition to this cheesecake.",

It's more of a creamy cheesecake and it's very dense. My only complaint is that the graham cracker crust was too crumbly. When I was marbling my two batters the crust was pulled away from the pan and into the cake. When it was done baking and chilling the crust stayed mostly together but I think it was just fused to the cake. Next time I think I'll make a chocolate cookie crust and use a darker chocolate in the cake (the semi-sweet didn't prove to be quite chocolatey enough). Thanks very much for sharing this recipe.",

Baked the cheesecake in a hot water bath for exactly one hour then turned the oven off and let it cool inside for another hour. Cooled on a wire rack for a good while (had to fend of some tempted family members at this point haha) and then chilled overnight.
