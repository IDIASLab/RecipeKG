The first time I made it was for a tex-mex potluck so I changed it a bit: substituted brown rice for white rice used frozen corn in place of fresh used lime juice instead of lemon used canned mexican-style diced tomatoes in place of fresh used only about half the dressing subbed cilantro for the basil and roasted the purple onions with the corn. I think we may have added some homemade salsa and crushed red pepper also. But it was absolutely amazing!!! Just about a different recipe. The second time I made it I followed the recipe. It was ok still too much oil and too much dressing overall and used brown rice and frozen corn again. Pretty good but not as good.",

I cheated and used the one pound bag of roasted corn from Trader Joe's. Super easy that way and it has great flavor. Probably better than I could do myself. I didn't use the red onion because I was already serving another salad that had it in there. And I did swap out fresh tomato for sundried julienne strips because when they are out of season I don't think they are worth the price. I would recommend olive oil over corn oil. I had to double the basil in order to get the flavor to come through. Could probably use a little more spices. Kind of bland for me.",

The Woman I Love tried some of the leftovers and she liked it a lot too. This recipe represented two \"firsts\" for me: I'd never cooked with basmati rice before; and I'd never cut corn off the cob before (which was tedious and messy the first time but I'll do better next time!). I followed the recipe to the letter. One funny thing though. The corn never got \"lightly browned\". I kept adding 5 minutes at a time to the original 15 minutes. I finally gave up at 35 minutes - the corn was cooked no doubt but still not browned that I could see. I wonder why that was? All in all this was a great recipe. It takes a bit of time to make (I don't enjoy peeling seeding and dicing tomatoes) but the final result is very tasty and will go a long way (I found that the \"8 servings\" amounts to 8 pretty full plates of the stuff).",
