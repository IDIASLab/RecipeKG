I just brushed some olive oil on the tortillas, turned them oil side down on a baking sheet and put some filling and cheese on one side and folded over, then stuck them in a 425 degree oven for about 5 minutes to get a little crunch out of the tortillas.

I also added some garlic powder and onion powder to the veggies while they were cooking. You can top the quesadillas with sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocado too.  So healthy, so delicious!
