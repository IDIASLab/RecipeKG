Instead of cutting the cookies out, I rolled the dough into logs (I had five logs about an inch in diameter with a double batch), covered them in Seran wrap and chilled them for a couple hours.  Then I cut the dough into half-inch chunks (I got average of aboout a dozen to fifteen pieces from each log) and flattened them on a cookie sheet with the bottom of a glass covered in sugar.  They turned out great!  I also made up some of the Almond Butter Icing I found under the \"Frostings and Icings\" section -- the two together make a great combo!",

I took other reviewers' advice and used only 2 cups of flour. Also I rolled it into a 2.5 inch log chilled then sliced the cookies 1/2\" thick.

I made two batches this evening for holiday gifts. Instead of using Almond Extract which I didn't have on hand I used vanilla extract and lemon extract. In the vanilla shortbread I also added cinnamon. After pulling them out of the oven I rolled the lemon shorbread in sugar and the vanilla/cinnamon in a cinnamon-sugar mixture. They turned out perfectly flakey and absolutely delicious. Don't worry if the dough is a bit dry and crumbly. It still turns out well. Just keep working it with your hands. Thanks Robin!!",
