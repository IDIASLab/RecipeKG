I did not have boneless chicken so I boiled the chicken in 5 cups of water first and then when it was almost cooked (about 15 minutes) I took it of the bone and cut it. I then added the rest of the ingredients as stated with the exception of the hot sauce (I did not any). Also I only used 1 package of onion soup added about cup of white wine and 1 tsp. Rosemary. Next time I think I will cut the potatoes in small chunks instead of slicing them.",

The soup mix has a strong flavor to it so I decided to cut out one of the packages. But in doing that I think I cut out too much flavor. Also if making again instead of thinly slicing the potatoes I think I will dice them instead. I also think the pasta should not be added until the last twenty or so minutes of cooking. By the time my potatoes and carrots were tender the pasta was mushy. I added green beans for some more color and I think it was a good addition. Overall not a bad recipe but needs tweaking to improve it.",
