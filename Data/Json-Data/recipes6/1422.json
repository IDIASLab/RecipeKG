I used bread flour in place of the kamut flour since that is supposed to be a good sub according to sources on the Internet and I left out the cardamom. When I tasted the batter I added some salt because it seemed lacking. I was surprised that there was no baking soda added since I'm used to that when using buttermilk; I do realize that the baking powder was upped probably to cover that. I wanted more sweetness--not a lot but some. They definitely need the crumble on top that was mentioned in the cook's notes.",
