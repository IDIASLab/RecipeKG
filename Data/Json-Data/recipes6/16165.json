I attempted to make this when I was limited with time and it took way more time than needed because I had to run to the store for additional ingredients because THE PROPORTIONS ARE WRONG!! First of all unless you're baking a 35\" pie ignore the Cool Whip content. Mixing Cool Whip with all that sugar (way too much which made it gritty and super sweet) and the cream cheese muffled the flavors of the other ingredients. I also needed approx. 3/4 of a can of Blueberry Pie Filling vs. the listed recommendation of 1/2 can. I altered the recipe as follows and it turned out okay: 1 1/2 bananas NOT 3 (3 would fill the entire pie shell!) 3 oz. cream cheese softened 2/3 cup powdered sugar (mixes better than granulated sugar) 1 cup Cool Whip or whipped cream (a BIG difference from the recommended 12 oz. container!) 3/4 can of blueberry pie filling 9\" shortbread pie shell I hope these suggestions make a better pie for any viewers of this review. I turned out to be very tasty but the original recipe will not result in a doable pie.",

I made the recipe tonight and my suspicions were correct...here are the adjustments that I recommend. 1) You will need two 9 inch deep-dish pie crusts. 2) You will use the entire can of blueberry pie filling (half on each pie). 3) You will still use 3 bananas (one and half bananas sliced on each pie crust). I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it turned out fine. I didn't have a problem with the granulated sugar as the other reviewer mentioned...if you cream the cream cheese and sugar with a hand mixer it will combine well. With all of this being said...I thought the pie tasted pretty good. Not out of this world but good. It was very easy to make it set up well in the refrigerator and the filling didn't run everywhere like many no bake pies. If I make it again I might try to add more cream cheese to give the filling a little more tanginess like a cheesecake and maybe use a shortbread or graham cracker crust.",
