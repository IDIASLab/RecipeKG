I think next time I'll just go with 1/4 lb of cheese. Gargonzola is a strong flavor so I think I can save some calories by decreasing the amount without sacrificing taste. In fact I bet the delicious onion flavor would shine through even more if there was less cheese. Besides decreasing the cheese I followed the recipe exactly. It was quite tasty; both my husband and I loved it! Thanks!",

It's a milder type of blue cheese and it went very well with the caramelized onions. It does take a while to caramelize the onions so make sure you start it in plenty of time to pop in the oven when your guests arrive. Also I made a homemade pizza crust because it's easy and so much better than the refrigerated type.",

I made 1/2 with just the gorgonzola and onions, (and we liked it this way )but we made the other half as another reviewer suggested with the onions, not as much gorgonzola, some mozzerella and cheddar, we liked it A LOT better this way.
