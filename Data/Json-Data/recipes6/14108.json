I didn't use the peanut butter chips or the walnuts because I was baking for a picky couple of guys! A note - I used a cookie scoop for these. The first batch came out with the weird marks on the top from the scoop's wiper and they stuck slightly to my baking sheet. For the second 2 pans I put down parchment and pressed them lightly with my hand before baking. Perfect!:)",
