I generally cut the recipe in half and make it in an 8x8 or 9x9 pan. I have added, in no particular order, minced jalapenos, a can of drained Rotel tomatoes and chilis, green peppers, red peppers, turkey sausage, hot sausage, bacon, and various cheeses (regular or low-fat), depending on what I have on hand. (Please note: I have never added these all at once; this is a list of possible additions you might have on hand. And if you're halving the recipe and are enthusiastic in your additions, use 5 eggs instead of 4.) Also, I use the packaged southwest-style hash browns in place of the plain hash browns. One suggestion: the only thing I found among the cheeses that I couldn't replace is the cottage cheese. It really is essential for creaminess. The one time I made this without, the casserole was brick-like, edible, but not nearly as good as usual. I often make this on a Sunday morning and cut the leftovers in squares and refrigerate or freeze, to be eaten during the week or later. Thank you for this delicious addition to AllRecipes.",

I drained it well for several minutes to get as much of the fat out as possible.  Other than increasing the bacon some, I didn't change anything and didn't need to. Put leftovers in the fridge and we had for breakfast the next day.  It reheats well.  Served with some warm soft freshly baked Cresent rolls.    Thanks for sharing.",

Would make sure the hash browns are fully thawed and DRY before placing in the mix (otherwise could be sloppy or ruined by too much moisture).  Also, did have to use paper towels to absorb grease from the top of the dish.  Afterward  this dish was not greasy looking or tasting.  I will make this again and again!",

For potatoes, I cut red potatoes w/ skin on into small cubes and sauteed til just slightly fork tender, in a small amount of some reserved bacon fat but w/ lid on pan to steam them so I didn't have to use too much grease to cook them.  (I make 1 1/2 times recipe so had 6 cups of cube potatoes) Precooked  the potatoes, cooked the bacon and onion the day before and then just added the eggs and cheese the day I made it.  I also used 2 -10 oz frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and water squeezed out thru colander, then added to the egg mixture.   1 1/2 X the recipe w/ fresh cut potatoes and spinach as above filled an 11 X 14 casserole dish and served 16.  350 X 1 hr or so.",

I followed the recipe exactly, with one minor modification:  I browned and crisped the hash browned potatoes (shredded 'em myself, using non-peeled, Yukon Gold spuds) first, and placed them in the bottom of my baking dish.  All other ingredients then went on top of the hash browned potato base.  My two sons INHALED this, as well.  In our household, this will become a recipe used for \"special\" breakfasts - you know, Christmas morning, Easter Sunday, etc.  Many thanks for a true 5-star recipe!",
