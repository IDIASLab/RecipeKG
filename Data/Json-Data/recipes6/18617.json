For those of you asking questions about golden syrup: Golden syrup, like molasses, is a product of the process of refining sugar. It is simply sugar cane juice that has been boiled down. It has the consistency of corn syrup, but a golden color and a taste different from either light or dark corn syrup, and also substantially different from its cousin, molasses. \n\nThis recipe is unlikely to taste as good without the use of honest-to-goodness golden syrup, but if you must, you can try substituting it with 2 parts light corn syrup and 1 part molasses or equal parts of honey and light corn syrup. You can purchase Lyles Golden Syrup on Amazon.com if you can't find it in local stores.  Hope this helps.",

I called a few gourmet and \"world market-type\" food stores and found it quite easily. Lyle's Golden Syrup is a popular brand most all of them carried and not terribly expensive either. This gingerbread was absolutely delicious. It smells wonderful while baking and produces a thick moist loaf. The only change I made was to increase the ginger to 2 Tablespoons. I believe I will be using this recipe from now on. Try it and see for yourself - you won't be disappointed.",

I'll explain for starters I had to improvise as I hadn't all ingreds. required onhand (like all spice ground ginger corn syrup or maple lol...the main ingredients) and also wanted it to be nearly sugar-free so here's what I did: In the saucepan I heated 1/4C sugar 3/4C water 2Tsp honey & 1/2Tsp maple syrup 1tsp vanilla extract 1/2 tsp orange essence and 1Tbs fresh grated ginger and a pinch fresh grated orange zest (what the heck might as well...right anywho)and followed the rest of the recipe as it stated only instead of using 2C all purpose flour I used 1C wheat &1C all purpose flour and 1Tsp cinnamon. I plan to pick up the ingredients required on my next shopping trip as I intend to make this bread exactly as the recipe states. Improvising with what I had onhand also turned out to be a very delicious dense bread. My hubby said it tasted alot like sweet potato bread and he ate quite a few pieces of it. So I guess I gained 2 recipes from one. Definately making again both ways. Thanks",
