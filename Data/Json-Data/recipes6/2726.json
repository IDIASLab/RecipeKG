For those of you who don't have a kitchen scale, I measured out 1/2 lb of brown sugar using my scale, and then put it in a measure cup, and it measured out to 1 cup, firmly packed - so if you are making the full recipe, 2 cups of brown sugar, firmly packed. I did need to bake this closer to 40 minutes to get a toothpick to come out clean. The coffee flavor really shines through. I might cut back the chocolate chips just a little bit next time. Thank you for sharing your recipe - I will make this again!",
