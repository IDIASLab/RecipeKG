This worked well with pork but I think it'll be even better with chicken.. Thanks!",

If you make this don't expect it to look like the picture unless you use dark brown sugar. I followed the recipe and it produces an oil colored marinade. I was just a tad disappointed with this because it lacks something and I think it's heat of some kind. I wished I would of added some red pepper flakes or hot chile paste to it. I was gonna use mirin for the rice wine but was advised against that and purchased my first bottle of sake at the grocery store for around 8.00. I think we personally prefer the soy based marinades of this type much better and will stick with those. Thanks for something new and different to try.",
