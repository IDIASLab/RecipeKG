This roll cracked in several places despite rolling it and unrolling while cooling it as I do every roll I make. I also wonder why the originator posted that it takes 2 hours?? No way it takes that long. I had no fears going into this recipe except for the fact that the cake portion is most definitely not sponge cake which is what most easy/successful cake rolls are. I am still seriously doubting that this recipe needs baking soda I think perhaps a change to powder might be in order as well as a change in the leavening eggs to produce more of a sponge. I will be working with this idea of producing a better pumpkin roll I will be using my own cake roll recipe as a base as it starts with a sponge cake and has never cracked and I've made 100s of them. I'll post it when I get it perfect until then look for my cake roll recipe it's so good and so easy.",

I too loved it and the filling is so yummy, I was scraping the bowl to get it all! ~~~~ I forgot to add the walnuts to the cake so I just tossed them in the filling and that was perfect, I think I will do that next time also.  The filling is not too sweet, just right!  I got so many compliments.  My one suggestion is use a lot of powdered sugar when dusting your cloth before rolling.  I skimped a little on the edges and my roll was almost stuck!!  But it came out just fine and was really easy to do. I put my roll right in the freezer for about an hour to let it set up and then stored it in the fridge until serving, wrapped tightly in non-stick aluuminum foil.  Yummy, easy, beautiful, and quick, what else could you want?!?",

It netted him over $1500.00 too!!!\n\nSome tips I've learned over the years:  Double the recipe (everyone requests a pumpkin roll from me for Christmas, so I double many times over).  When doubling, add the entire can of pumpkin...makes an extremely moist roll that way.\n\nLine the pan with parchment paper...much less mess!\n\nChop the nuts (I prefer pecans) to cookie bit size (or buy them that way) and add them to the cream cheese filling.  The cake tends to hold together better with less cracking and the nuts give the filling a wonderful texture. \n\nI triple the filling mix for the 2 rolls (1/2 as much filling per roll), so there is a thick cream cheese layer throughout.  That's what everyone raves about.\n\nLastly, I wrap in plastic while they are still warm and place them in the freezer immediately....locks in the moisture.\n\nEnjoy!",
