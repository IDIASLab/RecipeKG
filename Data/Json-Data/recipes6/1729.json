Next time I will use a casserole dish though; I used a jelly roll pan (I scaled the servings to 3) and all the delicious sauce flowed to the edges of the pan and burned instead of caramelizing on the potatoes. The sauce it's so good!",

Also I agree with the others that 30 to 35 minutes is plenty of baking time. More than that and the pecans will burn. Hint: I fully prepared this the night before and stuck it in the fridge so the morning of all I had to do was stick it in the oven. Worked perfectly!",
