I don't usually like to share my secrets, but this one's free: keep the egg quantity, use half and half instead of milk; turbinado sugar adds a warmer flavor than white. Add some extra bread (a couple slices worth of ANY kind - I love the varying textures and colors), cram it with walnuts and 1/4 teaspoon of black walnut extract; use nutmeg instead of cinnamon with the black walnut flavor, ground ginger without. Exotic. I've topped this bread with thinly sliced pears in a pinwheel design (nicer flavor and softer texture than apples) and sprinkled the tiniest bit of brown sugar over them before baking. Warm with whipped cream is best, still it's a great start to any day as breakfast. Thanks, Ellen. I've been appreciating you for a while and would give you 10 stars if I could!",

The first time I made it I used 4 eggs like the recipe calls for, but I thought it was way too \"eggy\" (it almost made a layer of scrambled eggs on the bottom of the pan!)... so the second time I made it with only 3 eggs and it was PERFECT! Both times I made it with cheap store-brand white bread and it was absolutely delicious, so you don't need to use an expensive bread to get good results. I topped each serving with a dollop of homemade whipped topping (whip 1/2 pint of whipping cream together with 3 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla)... and then I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of that. It was truly \"TO DIE FOR\"!! Thanks so much for this easy and delicious recipe, Ellen! :)",

We use more bread, add a slice of  multi-grain or anything stale (like that 1 leftover hamburger bun), take off some of the crust on the bread but just cube it and fill the pan 3/4 full. Use less raisins, 1/4 cup that have been plumped in hot water, layer them with the bread and melted butter. 1/2 t. cinnamon is plenty for our tastes and don't forget the vanilla. We use 3 eggs and 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups milk. (Fresher bread uses less milk... staler bread needs more). This does not make a too eggy bread pudding. If you are eating this by itself use the 3/4 cup sugar. If you are topping it with a sweet sauce (we like melted vanilla ice cream .... sort of a creme onglaise -spelling ??? sorry) or serving it for breakfast with maple syrup then cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. This is soooo easy and you just can't stay out of it!  Thank you Ellen. And thank you Allrecipes.com ... what a great web site. LOVE IT!",
