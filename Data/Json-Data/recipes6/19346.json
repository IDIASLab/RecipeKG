Instead of whisking the milk mixture into the eggs and then back into the double boiler, I just tempered the eggs with about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, then whisked that into the double boiler. And I used one cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon and a little allspice. It was pretty strong last night. I can't wait to see how it ripens. So next time I will definitely cut down on the rum. Oh! And I did have a milk curdling problem in spite of using a double boiler and constantly stirring, so I just poured the milk mix into the blender and kept it running while I added the rum and cream.  Update!  I tried pumpkin pie spice this time around and did use less rum...perfect!!",

I followed suggestions of using only 1 cup of sugar. It's definately sweet enough with only 1 cup. However, I did not add rum. I used 1 tsp of rum extract. Everything else I followed TO THE LETTER. Be very very careful not to burn the milk. When returning the mixture to saucepan, I was worried. Alot of people said the mixture coagulated. After 3 minutes went by (as suggested, on medium heat) the mixture was foaming but not \"thickening\". I wondered, how thick is thick? As soon as I saw a pudding-like 'chunk' on my spoon I immediately removed the pan from heat and kept stirring. As it cooled, it thickened significantly.. it ended up like pumpkin pie filling before you cook it.  Hope this helps someone! ",

We couldn't drink it at all and believe me, we are not a family of angels that don't drink.  I went exactly by the recipe and even managed to not scorch the milk.  I enjoyed making it but threw all of it out this morning.  Is there an actual \"light rum\" like there is light beer?  I used the clear colored rum that I would considered light and hope that wasn't what messed it up.  If I ever get the nerve to make it again, I will use less rum.
