I even tricked my 6 year old who will not let vegetables past her lips.  I peeled the zucchini so she wouldn't see the green, but she still noticed some white flecks.  I told her the white was white chocolate chips.  I'm going to gradually start adding the peel in.\r\n\r\nThis will definitely be a regular at my house!\r\n\r\nUPDATE-Okay, I ate one tht was baked yesterday and sat overnight. The brownie's are now fudgy and wonderful!  The moisture from the zucchini must soak in more overnight.",
