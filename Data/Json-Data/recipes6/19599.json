I had some broccoli that needed to be used up, so I added that to the veggie mixture. I tasted it after the chicken was cooked, just before adding the veggies back, and it tasted like it needed a little sweetness, so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar. I served it over brown fried rice and it was delicious. I will make again with the changes I noted above. Thanks for the recipe!",

I took the advice of other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce and even then it was a bit salty. I also used both green and red pepper. Next time I make this I will use low sodium soy sauce and use less than what is recommended. The sauce turned out a bit gelatinous so the next time I will skip marinading the chicken. I will stir fry the chicken until done add veggies stir fry and remove from pan. I will then add the sauce to warm and thicken and then mix in chicken veggies and cashews.",

For a lower sodium content remove chicken from the marinade before cooking (and stir fry in a wok instead of a skillet) or use low sodium soy sauce. My family happens to like the extra sauce from the thickened marinade but you could eliminate or reduce it. Using the lightly salted cashews (instead of the regular ones) will also help. To make only 1 lb. of chicken 1/3 all of the spices cornstarch wine and soy sauce.",
