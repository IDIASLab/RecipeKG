I followed the other suggestions and made these changes to the recipe: use 2 eggs in the bean mixture and also add to the basic recipe 1 can mild diced chilies 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp coriander. I also used 1Tbsp jarred chopped jalapenos instead of fresh and it was really mild so I'll add more next time. I'll also add some cilantro next time. This recipe made 18 patties (golf ball size when I scooped them out) which I flattened. I had to move the oven rack to the middle because they burned otherwise and then I baked them for 7 min on one side and 4 on the other. They were good but needed more spice. Also next time I'm going to make them much thinner/flatter and add more salt & pepper (I only used 1/4 tsp of each).",

They're also good with melted crispy cheese on top. I thought they made good leftovers just warm in a pan the next day. You must make the cream for topping it really adds to the taste!
