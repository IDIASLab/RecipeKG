I really like the flavor of molasses but thought it was overpowering here. The texture did change after a few days and it tasted better when I warmed it up a bit today. If I try the recipe again I would replace some of the molasses with honey and/or add some apple or pear to cut the bitterness. Make sure you watch the bake time - mine was done after 1 hour.",

I added ground ginger to my recipe to give it authenticity. I found that my Parkin sank in the middle throughout the whole time in the oven. I preheated properly didn't open the door measured and mixed correctly and in the right order etc. so not sure why it should sink except that the temperature isn't right? I read somewhere that most cakes are baked at 350 F so perhaps it needed to be baked at that slightly higher temperature but for less time...? Anyway the cake takes good (although ginger is an absolute MUST for Yorkshire Parkin!!)",
