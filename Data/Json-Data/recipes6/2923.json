I made 18 little bundt cakes with this recipe for my daughter's community service group and it was a hit.But I had an issue with both the batter and the glaze they were too thick! I had hard time filling the mini bundt pan. I had to use a spoon to spread the batter in the bottom of the pan. For the glaze I had to thin it out with 2 tablespoons of hot milk. Next time I will use extra large eggs or reduce the flour little bit.But for glazing I will use my usual ganache..",
