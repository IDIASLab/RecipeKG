Other than the unnecessary cooking time even for 12 servings, nothing to complain about here, it was simply nice to make pulled pork without BBQ sauce.  I can see many applications other than a pulled pork sandwich for this recipe, and will be trying a few with the leftovers.  I served this today as a sandwich with Asian cole slow, and it was delicious.  This recipe does have a lot of ingredients, but none overpower the pork.  Ingredient flavors are subtle, and you\u2019ll taste many layers of flavor.  This is a good recipe for those who want to \u201cstep outside the box\u201d for pulled pork.  Katherine Dyer, thanks for an outstanding new recipe.",

I used fresh squeezed oranges and lemons in equal parts. I cut the amount of honey in half, I don't like meat too sweet. I substituted Chinese 5 spice since it contains most of the spices listed here. I omitted the balsamic vinegar, didn't seem Asian to me.  I added garlic-chili sauce (found in Asian markets) and Sriacha hot sauce to compliment the sweetness. When I ran out of soy sauce I  combined it with ponzu sauce. (A lime flavored soy sauce you can also find at Asian markets.) I added about three teaspoons each of fresh grated ginger and chopped garlic. (I don't really measure) I quartered a brown onion and lined the bottom of my slow cooker with the pieces. The pork came out so tender and flavorful, the house smelled wonderful! I plan to make some ramen soup and fried rice with the leftovers.",

The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of the preposterous amount of cooking time stated. You don't need to cook it for 24 hours. If you do you should probably look into getting a new slow cooker because yours isn't working properly! The marinade itself however definitely rates 5 stars. If you like your meats sweet and savory you'll probably like this. I think this has earned a permanent place in our rotation.",
