I'm not sure why the other reviewer's steak was tough. Skirt steak needs to be cut against the grain. Miso paste can be obtained from any Asian market in the refrigerated section. Sure it's not available in your everyday grocery store but no reason to rate the recipe down for that! I'll definitely be making this for company and I know they'll be impressed!",
