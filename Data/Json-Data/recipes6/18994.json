We used pineapple chunks instead of crushed pineapple as well as light sour cream. Next time I'm going to try splenda instead of sugar to see how that turns out! These were amazing- I can't say enough great things about them! Fantastic recipe; these muffins are perfection. UPDATE: I tried them with half splenda and they were delicious. I also tried making them with crushed pineapple and found I like the small chunks best. We served them as part of dessert at our Hawaiian party and they were a huge hit!",

So delicious I tried to rationalize keeping them rather than gifting them to the people I made them for as a thank you.  I didn't succeed.  I can always make these again - and will. They're insanely good and deliver everything they promise - real tropical pina colada flavors of pineapple, rum and coconut.  I used butter rather than margarine and a full 20 oz. can of pineapple because that's what I had in the pantry.  Maybe that extra pineapple is what made them so especially good, chock full of pineapple in every bite.  The butter and sour cream guarantee richness and a moist, tender crumb. To take these over the top (I mean why waste the drained juice?) I drizzled a simple glaze over the muffins of reserved pineapple juice and powdered sugar.  My only thought, and one I'll be sure to remember as well the next time I make them, is because these are cake and not muffins,  they bake much better at 350 degrees rather than 375.  Even if not necessary, it sure can't hurt to do so.",

However can't really taste the rum so I suggest doubling the rum extract if you really want that pina colada flavor. I am not a big fan of rum so this wasn't a problem for me. I think these would also be good with a maracino cherry ontop or some other mixed fruit in the muffins.",

I used shredded coconut because it was what I had on hand but think flaked would work better in this recipe. I also used 1 Tbsp. of actual rum instead of the extract.",
