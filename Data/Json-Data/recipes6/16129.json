I substituted baby cereal (the dry flaky kind) for the potato flakes....the baby cereal is better nutrition-wise so thought I would try it since it has the same consistency as instant potatoes. The kolaches turned out light and wonderful! The dough was beautiful, and very easy to work with, too. Served them to 24 people and they were asking for seconds!!! No problem w/my filling running out -- with kolaches you need to make a deep indentation, and do not fill them completely full. Used apricot preserves as the filling, and made a struesel topping to sprinkle over the preserves. I think I will start using this recipe instead of my old kolache one. Great recipe!!",

We call them 'kolache' dinner rolls because originally the recipe was for kolaches, LOL. My bread machine broke in July and I even made them by hand the other day. Original review: I was a little disappointed in the actual kolaches that I made with this recipe---the dough had a weird consistency and I found it very hard to work with. My family wasn't too impressed with the kolaches and I had leftover dough. I let it rise some more, then I made it into dinner rolls. Now, those were GREAT!!! Even my husband, who is not a bread eater, thought they were great. So 4 stars for the kolaches and 5 stars for the surprise dinner rolls! Thanks for the great idea!",

I followed the dough recipe exactly, but I did not use the fruit filling.  I wrapped the dough around cocktail sausages and cheese.  I found that sliced chz works better than grated.  It melts better is much easier to work with.  I wrapped a third of a chz slice around the suausge and then wraped dough around it.  Make sure that you seal the dough well so that the chz does not melt out.  I think next weekend I will make them with the fruit filling.",

By weight, use 1 pound 4 ounces of bread flour.  Also, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup to match the sweetness of the traditional ones served in Texas.  Lastly, to make sure your fruit filling does not spill over, press firmly to bottom of baking pan when making your indentions.  By pressing the dough to the pan, it will prevent the middle from rising.  Also, make sure you make an indention about 1 inch in diameter (i.e., several thumb prints).",
