Per other reviews I reduced the sugar down to 1/4 cup and since I only had 1 can of corn I used a 16oz bag of frozen corn in place of the second can. For the \"topping \" I mixed the remaining 1/4c sugar with the cinnamon (to make cinnamon sugar) and set aside in a small bowl until it came time to add...at which time I only used 3/4 of that (which was okay...my boyfriend made some cinnamon toast with the remaining sugar mix). It did take a little longer to bake but the bowl was cleaned and everyone declared I MUST make this again very soon. Thank you Linda!!",

I always use the no-sodium added corn since the dish is so sweet already. I've made it a ton of different ways now - substituting in sweetened condensed milk or regular milk and starch for the evaporated milk. It tends to be pretty soupy so I try to reduce the liquids a little bit and add a little thickening agent too. I basically put almost no sugar in it (usually abt 1/3 c) but I find that brown sugar has a richer flavor (plus makes a nice sprinkling on top with cinnamon). It's nice to have a dash of cinnamon mixed in with the other wet ingredients too. It always takes longer than 1 hour - I'd clock it at 1:20 or so. This is definitely a keeper for generations to come!!",
