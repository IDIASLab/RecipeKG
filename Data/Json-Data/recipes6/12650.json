I baked them in a 9x13\" pan for about 35 minutes or so, and they came out perfectly - a little crisp at the edges and a little softer in the middle, just like bar cookies should be.  Fantastic recipe, thanks! :)",

It took longer for them to bake but they were chewy with a nice vanilla flavor. She didn't have chocolate chips. I'm not sure I would add them it might be too rich and sweet they are sweet without the chips and would kill the notion of being vanilla. They were great just the way my daughter made them. Thanks!",
