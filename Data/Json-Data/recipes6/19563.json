I thought it was really good but the tapioca was soft but it did leave a texture that I didn't particularly care for. My favorite is to use about a tablespoon of liquid pectin for a thickener. I also used one crust and made cut outs so you could see the berries. The brown sugar really gave it a subtle richness. I'll be making again with frozen cherries most likely.",
