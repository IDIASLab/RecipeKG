So five stars it is! For me the next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I will cut back on the icing and make a light drizzle over the top instead of pouring it over to soak into the cake. That will cut down on the sweetness for me (without sacrificing taste) and still make my family quite happy. Thanks for a great recipe that easily tweaks for those of us who love the taste of this cake but maybe want it a bit less sweet.:)",
