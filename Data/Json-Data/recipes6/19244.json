Be aware that when you put the seeds in it only takes 5-10 seconds for them to start popping. I had the skillet lid handy and took it off the heat and covered it for about 30 seconds until they finished... otherwise they fly all over your kitchen. I also added bay scallops and thought they tasted even better than the shrimp did. Definitely worth making again!",
