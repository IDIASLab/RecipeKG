The only changes I made was I poured the batter instead into two small \"meatloaf\" (not sure of the size) pans. This makes the cake a little more dense instead of so airy which is how my husband is used to it. I also heat juice and regular sugar over the stovetop and pour over and down the sides of the cake while it's still warm to be absorbed. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!",

Just make sure that after 30 minutes baking time you check the cake mine was done and well on its way to over done after 40 minutes. The glaze is delicious but you need more liquid then 2 TBS to be able to drizzle over the cake. With 2 TBS you get paste. I will make this again with changes I stated as well as finding out why it didn't raise a little more. The texture was angel food like but it didn't raise as much as I thought it should.",

This cake was absolutely delicious and will go into my rotation.  The only minor things I will adjust is an addition of orange extract to the cake (maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp?), as the orange flavor of the cake is a little light.  Also I will double the orange zest in the cake.  Finally, the glaze is delicious but only made enough for the top of the cake; therefore, I will double that.  Try this recipe as it won't disappoint!",

Flavor awesome - but texture (as Paul Hollywood may put it ) was a bit stodgy.  It only came up barely halfway on my angel food pan.  I was a little disappointed with the lack of \"fluff\".
