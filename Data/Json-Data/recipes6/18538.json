You can easily microwave the squash place skin side down on large plate(prick skin first all over) heat for about 15-20 minutes til tender I sprinkled with salt and pepper too. Then do NOT use marg..please do yourself a favour and use REAL butter!! Also a tiny pinch of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon (shhh) it's the secret ingredient!! Add a good dose of REAL butter again just before serving and a little S & P too. This got rave reviews for my Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and I've been craving it ever since!",

I baked the squash (I used one long heavy one) cut side down in a 1/4 inch of water at 375 degrees for a LONG TIME. When the skin is burning the squash is done. This brings out the flavor and mellows out the texture of winter squash. I scooped it out and added 2-3 TB of butter and about 2/3 cup sour cream. No salt or pepper - instead a heatlhy sprinkling of cinnamon nutmeg cloves and allspice (about a pinch of each?). Blended well with a hand-mixer. This was FABULOUS.",

First instead of bakinf it with water bake cut side up with just enough water to keep it from burning and cook a much shorter time(you want it soft but firm). Cut the sour cream in half and add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugarand some cinnamon. Because of the sugar and cinnamon the kids will love it and by not cooking it so long you will have a better texture.",

                "reviewBody": "As written this is a little ho-hum as well as slightly problematic but a couple of quick and easy fixes make this the perfect squash side dish. First, use butter, not margarine - nothing beats the taste of real butter.  Second, season this up. I don't like cinnamon or any sweetness with squash, nor do I like any seasoning that overpowers.  A little garlic powder would have been fine, but I also added some Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning as well.  Don't add the full amount of sour cream called for or you'll risk making this too \"sloppy.\"  Once mixed, I turned the squash into a baking dish and put it in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes till heated through. This also dried it out a little and gave it a thicker consistency. When you make this, think mashed potatoes, and what you'd do with them - it would work for this too.  Once out of the oven I topped it with another dab of butter and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. Now this was good - thick and creamy, delicately seasoned with a subtle and pleasant tang.  This would make a great Thanksgiving dish as it would be very easy to hold in a warm oven or Crock Pot until serving time.  Hubs and I both enjoyed this a great deal.",
