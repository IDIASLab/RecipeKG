I also have a Kitchen Aid mixer which makes this frsoting extra light and fluffy.  I agree that this frosting is better the next day.  It will loose the \"sugar granular\" texture if you let it sit.  This version is also much easier than the one that I made when I was kid. Thanks for the recipe.",

I will make these suggestions...Always use margarine rather than butter.  I use butter in all of my recipes expect this one.  To avoid curdling you must whip the frosting for at least five minutes or it will tend to separate.  Also, my recipe calls for adding 3T flour to the milk.  Lastly, add a teaspoon of the vanilla to the milk/flour mixture.  This is really the best white frosting recipe out there!!!",

I specifically like to use it for filling cupcakes (chocolate ones are the best!)  The first time I made it was for St. Patrick's Day cupcakes, so I substituted Bailey's for the milk to make an Irish Cream-flavored frosting.  It was yummy!  My recipe calls for 2-3 tbsps. of flour, and also 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, although you could also use almond, coconut, lemon, whatever you prefer. Lastly, I believe that those who complained about the grainy texture of the sugar and/or the \"greasiness\" from the butter did not *thoroughly* cream the butter, shortening & sugar together.  You have to cream it for at least 8 minutes if you're using a stand mixer, or 10 min. w/a handheld electric mixer.  Also, I don't completely cool the milk slurry before adding it to the creamed butter/sugar; if it's still a little warm (not HOT, but lukewarm), it actually helps to melt the sugar a little bit.",

It must be whipped, and whipped, and WHIPPED for quite a long time, BUT the end result is delightful.  After reading reviews...I let the sugar/short/butter whip for 10 min before even starting the milk.  The milk mixture took about 10 min(still whipping) the cooling took about 12 min(still whipping) and then I SLOWLY added the the cooled milk mixture in about 3 equal part, whipping 2-3 min. in between each.  At this point it was still a little granular and butter tasting and I was getting frustrated..added a bit more vanilla and whipped for probably 6-7 more minutes and then magically...smooth, silky, light, fluffy and crazily tasting like whipped whipping cream.  You just have to beat into submission,lol...worth it though.  As one poster mentioned...I did use 3 T of flour instead of 2 and I also added 1 t of vanilla during cooking milk...and probably 1/2 t at final whipping stage.  Hope this helps someone else : )",
