I used 4 1/2 t powdered garlic instead of cloves. I used regular paprika instead of smoked. I did not have any corn on hand or lime juice so I used lemon juice. I used gluten free beef broth instead of vegetable. Instead of making the cornbread mix I used Krustaez gluten free cornbread mix; I needed to keep the recipe gf plus it seemed easier to just make the box mix. I did not use any jalapenos. This was really good and I would make again; might even add some hamburger to it next time.",
