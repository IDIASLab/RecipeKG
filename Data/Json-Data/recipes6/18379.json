Doesn't need frosting or anything of the sort but this isn't a sweet birthday cake! I was a bit nervous that it'd be too sweet when I measured out the sugar but once the batter was ready and it already smelled heavenly I knew this would be good. I used Ghirardelli's cocoa powder and plain old black tea. Didn't have that much hazelnuts at home so I used half walnuts half hazelnuts. The results were a delicious and moist coffee cake. I'll have to learn this recipe by heart.",

Also I sprigkeled it with cocoa powder instead of confectioner's sugar cause I didn't have it -__-. Many thanks for the real good and simple cake recipe. I'll make it again and again.",

I think if I made it again I could make it taste better but it would need too many modifications - I would probably sub the tea for the same amount of buttermilk which would give it a nice flavor and much needed moisture for a better chocolate flavor I would add melted chocolate or as someone else did chocolate chips. It didn't need near the amount of baking time it called for. I baked it for 50min and it could have even gone less.
