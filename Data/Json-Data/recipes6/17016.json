I halved the recipe and still ended up with 24 cookies. 8 minute cooking time with 5 minutes of cooling on the pan was spot on. The dough was really easy to work with and the directions were clear and concise which I always appreciate. Give these a shot! Thanks:)",

They will not look done when you remove them from the oven but by the time they cool off on the rack they'll be perfection!! Moist and chewy like a gourmet cookie! Two minor changes I made: 1.)used the Nestle chocolate & peanut butter chip bag (come mixed together). It was really good without being overly peanut-y. and 2.) I dropped by rounded TABLESPOONS not teaspoons (would be a ridiculously small cookie if you did that!). Also I baked 2 dozen then formed the rest into balls (about another 2 dozen) froze them on a cookie sheet then transferred to baggies. It's been great to pull out a few cookie balls and bake them up fresh!! (Balls are formed with the same measurement: rounded tablespoon.) Also I agree with another reviewer - flatten them out a bit like you do with a peanut butter cookie dough.",

The thing that sets these cookies apart is the texture. They are so soft they literally just melt in your mouth. I've never had a cookie like this before so it is hard to describe. The best I can say is just try them!! I used 1/2 cup splenda instead of the white sugar and 2 large eggs. I took them out of the oven right at 8 minutes. Make sure you use peanut butter chips that are fresh...mine were a bit old and a little stale. Despite stale chips the cookies were WONDERFUL!",
