I followed other reviewers and added more chicken stock and coconut milk. I also did 1 tbsp of each fish sauce and brown sugar instead of the recommended amount. I added a small can of bamboo shoots. The potato is boiled separately in this recipe. I recommend doing the same for the carrots. They were a little crunchy despite simmering for a while.",
