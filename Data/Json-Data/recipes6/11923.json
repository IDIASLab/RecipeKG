Just before they were done I took them out of the oven pressed in the middle again and put them back in for a few minutes. I cooled them in the freezer before I took them out of the pan. Each basket held 2 chocolate foil-wrapped eggs. For decoration I put a few marshmallow 'chickens' on the plate. They look pretty good and I'm wondering how to use this trick for something other than Easter. The taste was 5 star and I'll make these as little cookies any time.",
