The first time through was my first experience making bread and was fotunate enough to read the comments suggesting to make only one loaf. It turned out rather small but the taste was exceptional! The second time though, i made a few modifications (doubling the recipe, adding a little more yeast, giving it more rising time, topping it with sesame seeds and butter, and adding a little molasses) and the results were beyond exceptional!\r\nI strongly urge anyone who trys this recipe to first double it, and second to give it a little more rising time.

Ppl really need to be careful with the amount of flour they put in the mix when they make it. Just because a recipe calls for three cups doesn't mean you will need to put all three in.... A lot depends on the quality/type of ingredients you are using and how dense you like your bread... Often times a dense bread is simply a product of adding too much flour. Anyway took me a while to figure that out so thought I'd pass that nugget of info on to others who may not know.... take it or leave it. As for this recipe.... the taste was BLAND! I followed the ingredient list and did not add/substitute anything - even though I had read the reviews. So piece of advice unless you like really bland bread you might want to add the recommended couple tablespoons of honey or subbing the white sugar for brown.",

I followed the advice of previous reviewers: I extended rising times by about 10 minutes I used 2 c of whole wheat and only 1 c of white I used soy milk instead of regular and I only made one loaf. Oh - I also used brown sugar instead of white and it worked just fine. The extra molasses probably added some extra flavor. I baked it for the recommended 30 minutes but I found the top was nearly burnt in some spots - so next time I'll reduce baking time by 5 minutes or so. Overall this bread is GREAT!! I'm just too proud of myself that I now know how to make bread by hand!! Thanks for the recipe...",
