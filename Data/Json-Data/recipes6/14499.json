                "reviewBody": "I have been making this for years and it is always a hit especially when children are at the occasion. I have a different set of directions that may help some people. Here they are: FIRST LAYER: Dissolve 1 package Jello in 1 cup boiling water for 3 minutes stirring often. Add 1/2 cup cold water. (I put ice cubes in the water stir remove the ice and measure out the 1/2 cup) Slowly pour Jello into buttered glass dish. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Start white layer immediately. WHITE LAYER: Bring 2 cups milk to boil over low heat. Add sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Dissolve Knox gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water; add to sugar and milk. Stir. Pour into blender or food processor. Add sour cream and vanilla. Blend until smooth. Let cool. If it should get too thick as you are making the salad you can try re-blending. If that doesn t work you can warm it gently. However I have never had a problem. I just stir it each time I need to measure some out. If you do need to re-warm make sure it cools before you pour it onto a jello layer. After the first layer of jello has been in the refrigerator for one hour AND is firm spoon (1 1/2 cups) of white layer (make sure it is no longer warm) slowly onto Jello layer. Let set in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Alternate layers allowing 45 minutes of chilling in the refrigerator for jello layers (after first layer) and 30 minutes for white layers. HINT: When I pour a white layer on I immediately start a new flavor of jello",

Wait to prepare them until right before needed otherwise they set while waiting their turn in their bowls. Each layer takes approximately 1 hour so I also recommend that you make the milk mixture right before the first layer sets or it will sit out for hours beforehand which can't be very good considering it's mainly sour cream and milk. The mold itself is really good. My kids loved it.",

A member had commented on the instructions not being clear. i made this in 3 1/2 hours. i made all the jellos right after another i didn't wait 30 minutes in between making jellos as suggested. I just left the jellos on the kitchen counter. They didn't set after three hours. I put the first layer in the freezer for 15 minutes to get a jump start on it setting quicker. Then poured in the pan. I let it set 30 minutes in fridge before pouring the white layer. 15 Minutes before i was to pour the next layer i repeated putting the layer in the freezer for 15 minutes. I noticed the white layers took longer to set. I waited 45 minutes after pouring white layer. i repeated this ritual till all layers were poured. This took me about 3.5 hours it was ready to eat 4 hours.",

I followed another users suggestion to wait to make the milk until ready to use and I wish I hadn't done that because it needed some time to set up. Also I didn't think it would need refrigeration after the white layer just the jello but I was wrong there too. The two times I didn't cool it the white and color mixed. I waited to make each jello until I was ready to use it then I dissolved my jello in 1c. of hot water then added 1/2c. ice water to make it quick set then fridge for 30-40 minutes and that worked wonderfully. Even with mistakes it looked great and tasted good.",

My advice is put the flavor you least like in the bottom because it sticks in the bottom (but not too bad!). When you mix the unflavored gelatin with the water dissolve it well cause it could form tiny little balls of gelatin. I used a mixer to mix the sour cream milk and gelatin.
