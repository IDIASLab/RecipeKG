Takes a little longer to cook, but the flavors meld into an exquisite homemade light potato and leek soup you'll make again and again. Garnish with nonfat sour cream if desired. Butter and cream lovers can add a swirl of cream and a pat of butter on top of their servings.",

While I noted the recipe doesn\u2019t state when to add the garlic, I added more and included it during the last couple minutes of saut\u00e9ing the leek. I couldn\u2019t get it to \u201cmash\u201d with MY wooden spoon but I think in the end, didn\u2019t matter anyways.  Finally, had to use vegetable broth as I couldn\u2019t find vegetable bullion cubes anywhere.  Now if give me an immersion blender - I can\u2019t stop!  Ended up with a very creamy soup that was really good as is! A tiny bit of heat. On my second bowl, I added some crumbled bacon I had on hand for another recipe and oyster crackers. Very good and relatively easy to make! Great for a fall or wintery day! Thanks for sharing!",
