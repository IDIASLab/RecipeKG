Took the suggestion of exchanging the sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar just because I like brown sugar better as a rule.  Tasted awesome and the topping was REALLY yummy.  Offset the filling PERFECTLY.  Great recipe and I will DEFINITELY make it again.  The menfolk gobbled it up after a long day's work with some homemade vanilla ice cream.  ",

They had been sitting in my fridge overnight soaked in some water lemon juice sugar and cinnamon. I also added to the apple mix 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I didnt use nutmeg because I didnt have any just added extra cinnamon instead. For the topping I added some quick oats and pummeled my walnuts untill they were almost powder. (My kids don't like big chunks of walnuts!) All in all it was good. I will probably make it again but I am also going to keep looking for a recipe where the apples are a little saucier almost just straight apples with a topping instead of the way they are in this one. The apples are just to I dont know. almost jelly-ish in this one with the baking mix and eggs.",
