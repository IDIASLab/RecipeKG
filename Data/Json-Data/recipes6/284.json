It seems like that's a large pan for the amount of dough, but trust me it's not. It's perfect!! This recipe is delicious. Keep in mind it's not actually toffee, but instead it's like a toffee tasting, chewy, buttery cookie dough. I use toffee bits on the top but honestly I think you could put any nuts you like, too (betting almonds would be fabulous). Very easy to make and a huge favorite with everyone at Thanksgiving. They are best (chewier) when they're not refrigerated.",

While the caramel was still warm, I sprinkled the top with good quality chocolate chips and popped it back into a warm, turned off oven for 4 minutes to soften the chocolate but not get it too warm.  I spread the chocolate chips with an offset spreader, then pressed crushed pecan pieces into the top of the chocolate before cooling.  \n\nAmazing! Chewy, cookie bottom but with yummy caramel, chocolate, and pecans.  This is what toffee is!",

I followed it exactly except that I used foil instead of greasing the dish- just thought it would be easier cleanup and nothing seemed to change. The bars were delicious and very rich:) I used pecans on top. The only advice I might give would be to press the nuts into the chocolate- mine kinda fell off some. Next time I might add a layer of actual toffee so there's more toffee flavor here but they were still really good bars!",
