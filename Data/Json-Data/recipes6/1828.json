Things got a little gooey but they baked up fine. Was surprised at how wide they spread out on the cookie sheet so I adjusted the size for subsequent batches. We get these at a bakery in Southern Ontario while on vacation. Can't find them in NJ. My homemade ones were just as delicious. Will definitely make again.",
