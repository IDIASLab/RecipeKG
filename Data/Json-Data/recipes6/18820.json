I poured the sauce over cooked brocolli and pan fried tofu and served it over rice.\r\n\r\nAfter making it a few times I realized that if I use only 1/8 cup of cornstarch it's a better consistency and it's not as thick.  I would suggest making these two changes, then it would definitely be a 5 star recipe.",

I was able to make this a little healthier by using \"Lite\" soy sauce and sodium-free chicken broth. I didn't have chile paste so I used powder. I also was out of fresh garlic so I used a powder there as well. It still came out wonderful. I can't wait to try this without substitutions! I made the sauce then put 4 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts in a baking dish. I poured the sauce over them (all of it) and baked for about an hour at 275-300. Served with chicken-flavored rice. Everyone loved it even my 3 and 5 year old kids (and a fellow student at school who finished mine off!). I will definitely use this one often!",

(after making a batch and pitching it therefore only 3 stars) 1 cup of sugar is way too much. I used 1/4 cup and I used Splenda. Much better. I used all chicken broth no water. I used Thai Chili/Garlic sauce instead of the chile paste and garlic. I added 1 teaspoon of ginger paste. This recipe said it makes 4 servings...huge servings maybe. LOL This makes about 2 cups of sauce. I only used 1/2 of it to feed my family of 5. I don't like my chicken to be swimming in the sauce. I will be making this again with the above adjustments.",
