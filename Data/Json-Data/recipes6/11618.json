Here's what I did: bring 1 1/3C sugar and 1C water to a boil.  Add 1C chopped, peeled ginger and simmer for 20 minutes.  Drain, dry and sprinkle with sugar.  It's quite strong when eated alone but when baked into this bread, it just adds a super rich flavor and a fun chewy texture.  ",

I used half WW half AP flour half brown half white sugar applesause instead of juice and reduced the molasses by about 1/3. I also didn't have fresh ginger so I doubled the ground ginger and I had to sub nutmeg for the cloves and it was fine. I only baked it for 30 mins then I turned the oven off and left it to cool inside. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for! Love it thank you for the great recipe!",

I'm back to the site because I'm making this again for Christmas Eve. I'm going to use the round springform pan as suggested. Like another reviewer I used OJ instead of apple & it came out just fine. Candied/Crystalized ginger was a challenge to find so I may leave it out this time if I can't find it. I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting to go with this... (2 blocks of cream cheese tsp cinnamon & cup of powered sugar tsp of vanilla) although a nice big scoop of whipped cream would do the trick too. Anyway! Great recipe! Just Delicious!",
