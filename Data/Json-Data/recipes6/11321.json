It's basically the same recipe only faster. I put it in a oiled bundt pan and bake it for approx. 30 minutes. The glaze is made of 5 tablespoons of butter, 1/3 cup milk and 1 cup white sugar mix and bring to boil for 2 minutes, remove from heat and add 1 cup chocolate chips....put on the cooled cake and garnish with halves of maraschino cherries.  Wonderful easy version of this same cake. It can also be made in a 9x13\" pan (which I spray with cooking oil with flour)....Both the recipe submitted and the easier version is wonderful!",

She was very impressed and said it was \"great.\"  I  used Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting from the allrecipes website and it was a good choice.  If you are a beginner to cake making as I am, this may help you:  In step #4, the recipe mentions serving the cake with chocolate buttercream frosting.  That could be interpreted to mean the \"frosting\" that is made in step #2, because it could certainly pass for frosting.  After realizing that the dry ingredients wouldn't work without the butter mixture in step two, it all came together in my mind, but it did give me pause.  Even I, the non-cake fan, have already had three pieces.  Between three of us, there's only about 25% of the cake left even though it was finished less than 12 hours ago.  The combination of cherries and chocolate is genius.  This cake is as moist as cakes come.\r\n",
