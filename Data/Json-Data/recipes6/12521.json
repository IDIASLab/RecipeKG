The dough is sticky and they spread so be careful when you place them on cookie sheet. I added extra almond extract (about 1/2 t) and toasted them (after cutting) longer than the recipe indicated. The flavor and texture was unbeatable. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.",

Some of the ingredients should be listed as 'divided' so people won't just go ahead and use them all at once. Plus the recipe never said when to add the baking powder! So I added it to the flour after I took out the 1/4 c. that I added to the almonds. I also added the whole 1 1/4 c. of sugar to the dough since the recipe didn't say what to do with the other 1/4 c. unless it meant to use all of that to sprinkle on top before baking if I wanted to (which I didn't.) This dough is very sticky and that should have been mentioned along with what to do about it (I sprayed my hands with Pam spray but a little extra flour might have been ok too). And I certainly didn't get 8 portions that were 8\" long and 3\" wide. I had 7 portions 6 of which were 8\" long and about 2\" wide and one portion that was about 5\" long. In any case these are really good and I will make them again using the changes I made. One more thing I cut straight across the way I do all my mandel bread recipes rather than diagonally.",
