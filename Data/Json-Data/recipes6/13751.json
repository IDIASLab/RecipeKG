It carmelized on me twice, didn't set for me twice and turned into granules, pebble like, once.  But, after finally getting it right, it was DELICIOUS.  Two hints that I think helped me are #1- you may not necessarily get the exact temperature on your candy thermometer, but if your mixture turns into a soft ball when dropped in cold water it's ready & #2- when you add the last ingredients, the butter, etc...add them into the pan that you cooked the 1st ingredients. Whatever you do, DON'T remove your mixture out of the saucepan into a different bowl w/ the butter.  I think that by doing that I cooled the mixture way too fast & I turned it into rocks.  \r\n All in all, this experience for me was the first time I ever made fudge & if it is for you too, then have enough ingredients to make a few batches.  I can't tell you how many trips I made to Albertson's that night trying to get it right.  But, it was well worth it, the fudge is delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent flavor but texture leaves a little to be desired. Made 3 times. Not a creamy fudge but slightly on the granular side. Tried using half and half in place of milk - no difference in texture. For those who have had problems with the fudge not setting up there are two possible reasons. First off fudge should never be made on a rainy/snowy day nor one with high relative humidity. Water is the enemy of fudge. Save this task for a clear day. Secondly the correct temperature is a must. There is a range between 232-238 for soft ball. Test the calibration on your thermometer by boiling water and checking against 212 degrees. One note on this fudge. Mine never lost its gloss. The first time I beat it for about 10 minutes and although it got thick it was still very glossy. The next 2 times I beat it for about 2 minutes and 1 minute respectively. It thickened up right away. No difference in texture. Still grainy. I never use compound spices as I prefer to make my own mixtures giving greater control over final flavor. Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves. Delicious! Update: Discovered the source of the grainy texture FINALLY! When you add the butter vanilla and spices (after removing from heat ) DO NOT MIX IN as the recipe states (only add them to the pan.) In candy making this step is called \"seeding.\" After seeding WAIT TO MIX THEM IN until the time when you beat the mixture at 110 degrees. Still not super creamy but no longer grainy.",

So, I figured, what the heck--  I put it ALL back into the saucepan and reheated it to 235 degrees instead of 232.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I let it cool and beat it as usual, and it turned out perfectly!!  So, there's still hope even if it doesn't turn out the first time.  Or you could always use the goop as a dip or icing for gingersnaps.  (I almost want to screw up a batch just for this purpose!!)  It's soooooo tasty!",

I agree that you need to do the soft ball test in cold water mine was ready a bit before my thermometer said it was -- it depends on the thickness of your pan how evenly it cooks and the placement of your thermometer on the pan. LET IT COOL COMPLETELY to 110 before beating. It did take about 30 minutes to cool. I only had to beat it about 3-5 minutes with an electric hand mixer and it was rady to go.

I was a little confused as to her directions though....wasn't sure whether I should add the butter & spices & not mix it in until it had cooled or if I was to wait until it had cooled to add the butter & spices. I went w/ adding but not mixing. It took a very long time to come to 232 & a very long time to cool to 110 so be patient & don't make this if you are crunched for time. It's not difficult at all to make...just time consuming. This set up perfectly w/ no need to refrigerate & I didn't have any problems w/ texture (thanks BARICAT!). My only complaint is that it was a little buttery...and that it makes such a small batch.;o)Hubby loved this fudge & he is not a fudge lover...says the typical fudge is too rich & sweet. Duh! LOL I loved the seasonal flavor of the fudge...hope my family enjoys it on our dessert table Thanksgiving day. Thanks Ginger!",
