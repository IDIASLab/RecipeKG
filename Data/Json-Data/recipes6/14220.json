This is a plain and simple, good old fashioned butter-based chocolate cake, an ideal basic and versatile recipe to do with whatever your heart desires.

I made a half recipe which yielded 10 cupcakes, filled only about half full as I topped them with chopped walnuts, miniature marshmallows and chocolate chips before baking. Put them out for the landscape crew working in my yard and within a couple of minutes all I had left of them was the photo I posted!",
