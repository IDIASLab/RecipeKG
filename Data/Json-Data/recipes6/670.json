After it was baked and frosted she would cut maraschino cherries into quarters and laid them on the frosting to look like little poinsettias.  She never had measurements and, hence, neither do I.  With this recipe, it's kind of nice to actually know what I'm doing.  I use golden raisins.  I plan on making this for a ladies neighborhood get together that I'm having.  Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe, Baritone Bob!",

                "reviewBody": "I rate this recipe about a 4 but others said no a 5. It does taste good. It kind of reminds me of a mix of a cinnamon roll and fresh baked bread. I realized I didn't have a 12\" round pan so I put it on a parchment lined jelly roll pan. Something large with sides will be needed as the filling seeps out some while baking. I took the advice on the bottom of the recipe and added optional ingredients. I sprinkled on the brown sugar mixture a 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. On top of that I added about 1/8 cup of raisins which I soaked in apple cider while preparing the rest of the recipe. I thought 2 Tblsp. of cinnamon seemed like a lot so I cut that amount in half too. During the cutting with the scissors I wasn't able to flip the dough slightly to show the filling. My cuts more or less helped with steam while baking. I may have to read other recipes on how to do that properly. I got busy and put it in the fridge covered with plastic wrap sprayed with PAM for about 5 hours. I let it rise 1 hour covered on the warm stove with no problem. So it would be fine overnight and baking in the morning. With the icing the amount of vanilla makes it come out a tan color and not white like snow. So I would suggest reducing the vanilla. The icing is also a spreading and not drizzling consistency so more milk would have to be added a spoon at a time. I took the advice of similar recipes and added marachino cherry halves to the top of the icing. It made it look very pretty.",

I didn't have the bread dough so I subbed 2 cans of crescent roll dough (1 lb of dough). I spread 1/2 the butter sugar and cinnamon on one section of pinched together dough; placed the other one on top and added the rest. I rolled it up and baked it in a glass 12 in. pie plate. NO need for rising. It did not make a \"ring\" so to speak as the middle puffed out. You do need to bake it in a dish- it gets oozy and don't wait to long to remove it. THIS WAS SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!",
