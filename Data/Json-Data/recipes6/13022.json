The only changes I made was to add 1/2 tsp more salt and I omited the nuts (only because I diddn't have any on hand) I also chunked up some chocolate but not more than about 1/2 of a cup I like more cookie than chips. I have to admit I was nervous about the soft oily dough, but it cooked up perfectly crispy in the outside and chewey in the middle. I baked them both on my Silpat mats and on parchment paper lined cookie sheets, both turned out great. I let them cool on the cookie sheet a few minnutes before moving them to a cooling rack. These are the most cookie like gluten free cookie I have ever made.",

Made them for a friend who is on a gluten-free diet and we ALL ended up loving them! Natural PB is recommended if artificial preservatives are a concern (true in the case of my friend). I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips which was great to cut through the sweetness of the dough. These don't really need nuts since the PB-nutty taste is quite prevalent. I had to cook a little longer than specified but they firmed up nicely and didn't stick to the cookie sheet (regular dark sheet).",
