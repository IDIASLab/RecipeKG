There will be a lot of foam on the top. Skim this off with a strainer and throw away. The double boiler step is not necessary. \r\nPour the hot mixture into individual serving dishes or ramekins and place in a baking dish. Set the dish with the ramekins in it on your oven shelf, then pour hot water in the dish so the water comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake at 375 anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. They are done when you shake the dish gently and the brulees jiggle just slightly in the middle. The jiggle shouldn't be a liquid jiggle, but more of a gelatin-like jiggle.\r\nRemove from oven and let the brulees cool in the water bath for about 15 minutes, then remove and put the brulees in the refrigerator to chill. Just before serving, sprinkle the tops with white granulated sugar and shake off the excess. Place under broiler til caramelized or use a propane torch to burn the tops. Serve immediately. Part of the fun of Creme Brulee comes from the crispiness of the burnt top compared to the creaminess of the custard. When you burn the top and then re-refrigerate the custards, the top will become soft again, which isn't as pleasing to t",

To stop the custard cooking again when you caramelise the sugar under the grill/broiler, pack the tray around the dishes of creme brulee with ice. This keeps the wonderful contrast in texture between the hot and crispy layer of burnt sugar, and the cool slightly wobbly creme beneath. Lovely.",

The recipe says use 4T (brown & white sugar)in the egg mixture and the remaining 2T for the topping to torch. (!!!) I did graduate from college; where are the other 2Tbsp in this recipe? Why is the 6T white sugar divided in the first place? Anyhow enough of a rant...I added all of the sugar in the egg mixture reserving enough to coat the tops and torch.",
