The meringue was made of 6 egg whites and 8 tbs sugar.  I kept the cooking time the same but plan on covering the edges of the crust with tin foil for 25 minutes, then remove and let the pie bake for 10 more minutes. Make sure when you put the meringue on it touches the crust edges or it will shrink.  The meringue was the perfect amount for me, but I love meringue. \n\nI made the french pastry crust recipe from allrecipes and it came out thicker than I wanted but was perfect for this pie.  The orange pudding was watery after setting  but the thicker crust soaked it right up.  I plan on baking the pie a little longer next time but the crust edges were too brown to try this time.  I used honeybell oranges which are in season right now.  The tart and sweet orange made the flavor perfect.",
