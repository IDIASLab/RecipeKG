I love the oatmeal in it, but think that 1/2 a cup is a little too much.  I used quick cooking oats since that's what I normally have on hand and substituted a container of strawberry yogurt for the strawberries.  I have not been able to find a decent batch of strawberries yet this year. They are not sweet for some reason, so I'm a little hesitant to buy them.  Anyway, the oatmeal made this smoothie VERY filling and I too omitted the vanilla and sugar since I used vanilla flavored soy milk.  Great new find...thanks Astrophe.",

It has just the right amount of sweetness, and it's thick and filling with the strawberries and oatmeal, so I often have it as a meal . Like others, I always process the oats first to a powder. I then add the milk, and I add just enough strawberries to meet the level of milk instead of counting them, since the size of the strawberries often varies. I find this gives it just the right consistency every time! Thanks for a great recipe!!",
