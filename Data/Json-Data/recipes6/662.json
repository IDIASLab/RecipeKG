I like a stronger sauerkraut taste, so that might do the trick. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!",

Ours baked for 3.5 hours and was still swimming in juices - I knew there was no way it'd be cooked off in 30 minutes so I ended up dumping a bunch off. This probably dumped off a lot of the sweetness. What was left tasted like beer soaked apples and kraut. I'm giving two stars because I really liked the flavor of the pork - it was quite delicious. Unfortunately I think there are much better ways of getting good flavored pork. This one is going on our DNR list - Do Not Repeat. Sorry.:(",
