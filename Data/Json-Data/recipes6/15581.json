Make sure to keep the balls small so that you can cook it all the way through without getting the outside too burned. I would suggest about one inch balls at medium heat for about 15-30 seconds each side until just lightly golden. I didn't have coconut milk and used fat free evaporated milk which may have taken away from some of the flavor. The cardamom and cinnamon complemented well though. I added some raisins to a few of the puffs which worked fine too. I didn't have self rising flour and substituted regular flour with some baking powder (about 1-1 1/2 tsp) which seemed to work fine. I also lightened it up with splenda instead of sugar. It would probably go well coated in powdered sugar or maple syrup or honey as well. Over all easy to make and good for a quick treat dessert or breakfast for guests or family.",

It was really difficult to drop balls into the oil without them separating... so I suggest dropping in SMALL balls. They expand a little anyway. Also didn't have self-rising flour so just used regular flour 1 tsp baking powder. They taste good with honey or powdered sugar. oh and i like them soft inside (tried both cooked all the way and not so cooked) so I ended up not cooking most of them all the way.",
