First of all you must use whole milk and heavy cream. Second use a short grain rice (the shorter grain rices make more starcch to thicken the pudding). I chose to add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and sprinkled the cinnamon on the top of the pudding after it was cooked. It seemed a little strong to me when adding a tbsp of cinnamon to the mix. All in all every time I have served this pudding it gets absolute rave reviews. Thank you Tiny Chef!!",

Definately use heavy cream and don't try to skimp with the fat because it really adds to the dish a world of taste:)",

I do not recommend using skim or 1% milk and you cannot skimp on the heavy cream. I used whipping cream 35%..... this recipe is worth every minute it takes to prepare and the calories. Bravo!!!",
