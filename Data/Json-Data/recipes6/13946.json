At home, or rather in your backyard, the grill is the way to go. The heat of a hot grill is perfect, and makes it possible to make incredible pizza at home. Use your favorite toppings, but keep in mind not to overload the pizza. Keep it light. Try it - everything is better on the grill!",

The first time he made it he burnt most of the crusts. It definitely helps to have two people working together. I didn't make the crust. I used frozen dough balls from Sams Club thawed, cut in half, and rolled out thin to fit the grill shape. 2 dough balls will give you 4 nice sized pizzas. I also precooked the toppings because you can't let it on long enough to cook them. I use finely shredded cheese because it melts faster. Ragu pizza sauce tastes great. He sprays the grill with a little pam before putting crust on. Husband said we'll never go back to baking them in the oven, even during the winter.  You've got to try this one!",

Grill med. hot, put the dough on a sheet of aluminum foil dusted with flour so two people can flip it right on the grill. Slick. I have been baking home made breads and pizza dough for over 30 years so maybe that is why I had no trouble. I don't know but what I do know is we LOVE THIS PIZZA! thanks for this keeper!",

I was scared to try it; what if the dough dropped through the grill, etc etc etc?!  But it didn't.  Held together beautifully.  Just follow the instructions that Doug has laid out, and you'll succeed!  I did divide my dough into quarters rather than in half so I could have smaller pizzas with varying toppings.  Be sure to wait until the dough \"puffs\" before turning it over; I made them one at a time and actually turned each one over onto a pizza pan to add my toppings. Be sure to have all of your stuff organized and ready to go!  Pizza 1: pesto, mozzarella/fontina/parmesan, fresh tomatoes; Pizza 2: jarred red sauce/Italian seasoned sausage/mushrooms/black olives/mozzarella (I made this one double the size of the other two); Pizza 3: jarred red sauce, carmelized onions, mozzarella/fontina/parmesan.  All three were great. I rolled the crust out thin and it was wonderfully done on the top and bottom, and crisp on the outside, chewy inside.  For a homemade pizza, it's the next best thing to brick oven pizza.  I doubled the dough and froze half. You gotta try this method! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Doug!",

A trick we use is to grill the crusts quickly on a hot grill (about 400F), then flip them over so the cooked side is facing up onto a cooking sheet.  We then bring the pizzas inside the house so that our teenagers and their friends can make their own pizzas using an assortment of toppings.  As each pizza is created, we bring it back outside and finish cooking the pizza, with the uncooked side down on the grill.  This time, we cook it on a lower heat (about 300F) so insure the cheese melts without the crusts burnning.  We've tried putting toppings on the pizza on the grill, but it's just oo darn hot that way.  Bringing them inside allow us time to make each pizza the way we want to.",
