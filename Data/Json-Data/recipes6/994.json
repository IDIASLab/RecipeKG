I usually use homemade peanut butter which has little to no sweetener so if you are using store bought (even natural) you might want to cut back on the other sweeteners. Also some reviewers commented on only boiling the peanut butter mixture 2 minutes I don't even boil it that long I just let it come up to a boil which takes 3-5 minutes from when I turn the heat on. Love that everyone is playing with the ingredients change up the cereal grains nuts seeds chips etc. The peanut butter chocolate is our favorite and I always use the PB sometimes with the almonds sometimes more peanuts. I have done white chocolate & almonds. I've used golden Graham's for the cereal and replace the nuts with mini marshmallow for a s'more like bar. Did pecans & a white chocolate & cinnamon chip mix. Enjoy your creations.",

My changes: I used chopped dried apricots instead of chocolate 1/4 c or more of wheat flour instead of wheat germ cheerios instead of rice crispies frosted mini wheat crumbs instead of corn flake crumbs half and half almonds and pecans added a little cococunt and sunflower seeds. Wet ingredients: omitted the peanut butter and agave reduced the amount of sugar and honey and added 2 eggs. I mixed it all up then combined it with the dry ingredients and baked it at 325F for 30 minutes. Yumm. This recipe is so adaptable. And delicious:)",

And instead of wheat germ I used Oat Bran. It really turned out great! When you boil the honey and peanut butter mixture only let it boil for about 2 minutes. My batch got a little crunchy instead of chewy. But this is a great recipe where you can interchange some of the ingredients.",

My son eats through granola bars like you wouldn't believe and now I can control the processed food and sugar by making them myself. Only made minor changes because I didn't have rice cereal so I doubled the flakes. Added sunflower seeds and used natural peanut butter. May try to reduce the brown sugar by half next time because they are sweet for my taste but not a huge deal breaker. Agree with the previous review to only boil for about 2 minutes.",
