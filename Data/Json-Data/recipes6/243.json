The only tweak I made was to use \"Dave's BBQ Sauce\" from here (super easy to make from pantry staples) and I do think that probably imparted a bit more flavor than a bottled sauce, so keep that in mind.  I may have used a bit more ham, too, simply because it's what I had left to use.  These received rave reviews from guests and multiple recipe requests.  This will become a rib dinner side staple at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, wannabe chefette!",
