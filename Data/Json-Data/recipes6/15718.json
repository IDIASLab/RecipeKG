(actually used an auto mixer came out sticky may have been hard to do by hand i don't know) prepped the loaf pans with spray and flour filled about half way baked for 45 mins @350 came out nice and dense and the crust was kinda crusty. i like dense bread so it came out awesome. a simple icing over the top mades it a tasty dessert bread and great with butter. doubled the recipe made 4 small loaves",
