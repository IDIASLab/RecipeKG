I spread the butter as evely as I could but it just didn't seem to be enough.  Overall it was pretty good, very delicious \"pumpkin pie meets nutty cake\"",

The top was hard and crunchy the first day, and difficult to cut coupled with the soft pumpkin base (maybe because I used less butter). But a few days later, the top had softened and it was so good I couldn't keep my hands off of it. The guests seemed to enjoy it as well, unfortunately they only tasted it the first day it was made. I'd recommend this, but make sure to make it a day or 2 in advance, and next time i'd use less cake mix on top so the pumpkin flavor can stand out more.",

I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking and added a little bit of salt to the pumpkin mixture to cut the sweetness. Very good recipe. A definate keeper!!:O)",
