Other than putting it in a 9x9\" pan, I made this with no changes. It's not difficult to imagine that some of the reviewers thought the cake was too sweet if they were doubling or even tripling the topping ingredients! The amount of topping as specified in the recipe is perfect, and makes for a not too sweet, \"just hits the spot with a cup o' joe\" coffeecake. That said, I thought the cake was a good, basic coffeecake- nice, but not extraordinary.  I'll still keep trying other recipes until I find one that really distinguishes itself from others.",

I did double the filling because the crumbs to me are so yummy. I also baked in a 9inch springform pan for an hour and it was perfect. Much easier to present on a dish and cut up when all you have to do is remove the sides of the springform pan. Next time I will add some chopped nuts to the crumb mixture and drizzle a conf sugar icing on top when its still warm(1 cup conf sugar 1 tbs butter 1 tbs milk or cream) and that would be the ultimate coffee cake! As a side note about all the reviews about the sugar being too much-I did not quite fill my cups full so I skimped a little- but I found it not to be too sweet at all.",
