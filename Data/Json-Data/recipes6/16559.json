I found the frozen pastry puffs near the waffles and the brand was peppridge farm. I noticed they make flat sheets as well and a cake of these could be made quite easily. I followed the recipe to a T. I did not alter a thing. They taste great. Light and airy. I was able to eat the whole thing imagine that. I could have had another to be honest. This is a great summer dessert and we are pairing it with steak and asparagus. I am also serving a guac. dip with chips before hand. Thanks!",

I filled the shells 4 hours ahead of serving and was pleased that they didn t get soggy. Then to serve I drizzled the plate with some chocolate syrup placed the filled shell on the plate spooned strawberries over including some of the accumulated juices added another dollop of the cream cheese mixture topped with the pastry top and a sprig of lemon balm! Beautiful!! I hope the picture I am posting does this justice. Trust me this one s a showstopper!! Oh and very yummy too! For extra decadence serve some additional chocolate syrup at the table!",

I used toffuti cream cheese to keep it non-dairy and added a couple of drops of red food coloring to the cream cheese mixture to make it pink.

I do think the graham adds a bit more flavor but the pastry has great presentation. The filling is really good.
