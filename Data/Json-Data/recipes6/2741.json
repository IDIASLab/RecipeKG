I am also lowering the temperature to 200 and keeping in the oven longer. Wish I had a food dehydrator. I used a new vegetable peeler which Are makes vegetable \"ribbons\" to get really thin pieces. It made pieces too thin to handle properly. It wasn't a complete loss. Those pieces became little \"crumbles\". Also working on substituting zucchini for eggplant",
