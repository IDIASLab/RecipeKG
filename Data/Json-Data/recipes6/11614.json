I used 1/4 cup balsamic (a really nice aged one that's fairly thick and sweet) and then 1/8 cup each of raspberry vinegar and pomegranate vinegar. I omitted the orange as I don't care for it in cranberry sauce. I made it just now as a dry run before Thursday and this stuff is simply divine. I would give it more stars if I could and it is going to be our cranberry sauce from now on. Many thanks to Christine!",

I used 1/4 of a cup since it wasn't the right kind and I didn't have a completely full bag of cranberries. I left out the orange zest since I don't like orange flavor in anything. The cinnamon stick was perfect! It made our Jan. 29th Fakesgiving a hit.",
