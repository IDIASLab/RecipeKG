I don't like green peppers so I used a sweet orange pepper. Also I didn't have any jalepeno on hand so I substituted a pablano pepper. Very tasty. When I open a can of chipotle in adobo I blend it and keep in in the fridge or freeze in small amounts. I suggest adding a little at a time to reach your desired heat level. Next I will try this on fish tacos!",
