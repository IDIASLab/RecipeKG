It plumps the raisins and makes the apples more tender.  Then I drained the apple/raisins in a strainer over the baking dish, which greased it nicely, paper-toweling off the excess.\r\nAdded the warm apple/raisins tothe bread in a bowl, stirred well and dumped into the dish.  Then, in the same skillet I poured the milk, brown sugar, butter, vanilla (I used a whole teaspoon) eggs, and I added apple pie spice (could use pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, allspice, any of those) to the cinnamon, and just stirred it all together over medium low heat until the butter melts as directed and pour it over the bread mix in the dish and voila! I baked it nice and long, til it was 'set' and deep golden brown on top.  Wonderful wonderful stuff.  If I had had some wine or brandy to soak the raisins in.. I would have.  YUM.",
