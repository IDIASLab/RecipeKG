I always use four cups of apples and more cinnamon. Also, I bake it at 300 for 1 hour and 45 minutes and it is always perfect. If you want a real slice of heaven, substitute fresh peaches for your summer picnics - delicious. This is always the favorite when taken to any event. It is a heavy cake and gets better with each day - if you can keep it around.",

I used half apple sauce and half oil when I made it but think it would have been fine with all apple sauce. I cut out some of the sugar and next time I would have used some brown sugar instead of white. I used Granny Smith apples and the tart taste of the apples complimented the cake well. Next time I'd add more apples though. I also would have kept the wet ingredients separate from the dry ingredients until the very last minutes to see if it would have helped in lightening up the cake a little. Apparently not keeping wet and dry separate until the last minute will cause long gluten strands to form which will make the dough tougher or heavier.",
