I made these for a cookie swap and only ended up with 3 dozen (I may have made the cookies too big). Also making the cookies into balls is not easy because the dough is soooo sticky. Wet your fingers before rolling - this will prevent the dough from sticking to you. All in all though - this recipe is worth making.",
