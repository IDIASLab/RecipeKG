This time I used fresh celery, carrots, onions and a generous amount of garlic.  Mixed the tomato sauce with a quart of Aldi Vegetable Stock, then added frozen green beans, frozen corn, and frozen peas, followed by fresh russet potatoes and a can of Muir Glen diced fire-roasted tomatoes.   I meant to add kale but totally forgot.  Added some fresh ground pepper - no extra salt and no other spices, and it was totally scrumptious.  It was also beautiful.  My husband actually took pictures of it because it was so fresh and vibrant looking.  We both had big bowls with hot Peasant Bread from Whole Foods and had enough for at least 3 more meals.  Thanks for this fabulous recipe - a real keeper.",

I usually do not eat okra, but it was very enjoyable in this recipe. A good basic recipe waiting for added special touches.",

I also threw in a bay leaf when the soup was cooking.\n\nLastly- I cooked this in my Instant Pot pressure cooker- for anyone else out there who has one, I just sauteed the onions, celery & garlic and seared the potatoes beforehand...then threw everything in the pot and used the manual button to set it for 15 minutes...then I allowed natural release for 6 minutes and released manually the rest.  It was absolutely perfect...the veggies were tender without being mushy and the soup tasted great!\n\nMy hubs doesn't like soup, let alone veggies and he LOVES this.",
