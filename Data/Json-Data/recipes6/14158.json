I left out the sugar increased the sweetened condensed milk to 3/4 cup added another egg some cinnamon and nutmeg and at least doubled the amount of pecans in the topping. It was a hit but I heard lots of jokes about hardening of the arteries because of all the yummy butter in it. My husband says it tastes like a cross between pumpkin and pecan pie.",

I was a little leary about the topping that goes on the top but it is a must. The guest loved the topping. I did cut down on the sugar as suggested by other reviewers and I did have to bake mine at least an extra half hour or more. The end results were great. Thanks for the recipe.
