That being said I have had rave reviews on this recipe. My family loved the first batch so I made another to take to a picnic and they were a hit there too. I tried adding some spice to the second batch like some users recomended but it didn't seem to make a big difference in the taste - maybe I didn't add enough. However I like the taste of the original recipe anyway - I think if you add too much spice it would overwhelm the taste of the batter. The frosting was a little too sweet for me so in the second batch I added the confectioners sugar a little at a time and tasted as I went along - I ended up using far less than what was called for I'd say about half. The second batch of icing was much less sweet and I thought a perfect topping for the bars. Bottom line is this is a good recipe to make as is or to tweak to personal preferences. And DEFINITELY squeeze the water out of the shredded zucchini - it made all the difference in the world.",

It is extremely important to drain the zucchini. Just put the shredded zucchini in a dish towel and wring out. When you see how much water comes out you will see why it is so important to do this. My bars still took about 15 minutes longer to cook than what the recipe stated. If you make the frosting make sure you add about 1 cup of the powdered sugar and taste then keep tasting until it is the taste you prefer. Thank you! I had to change my rating on this. I guess I rated it too soon. My family loved these so I changed rating to a 5! They are very moist!",
