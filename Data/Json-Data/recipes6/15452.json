Also the lemon pudding doesn't cover the cream cheese filling very completely - I would use a bigger box of lemon pudding or two smaller ones.",

Next time I will buy a \"new bag\" of better quality pretzels and crush those. We served this dessert on the same day as we made it. We also wonder if making the dessert one day refrigerating overnight and then serving it might moisten the pretzel base and make its texture more appealing. I will try both of those approaches; however even when the base not as desirable as we would like - we can still scoop out the filling and serve it in a bowl like a parfait!",
