This recipe is very close to a classic split pea soup, but I have the option of cooking with or without a meaty ham bone. If you just have ham, it will be just as great with the combination of celery, carrots, onions, potatoes, and split peas. Get ready for a thick and flavorful broth!",

I received many compliments asking for the recipe so I know it was a definite hit. \nWhen I made it in the pot I left it about 4 hours. I think this made all the difference in breaking down the carbohydrates more fully so they did not causing bloating and gassiness. \nThanks for sharing!",
