I tried it again with an extra egg and only 1 1/2 cups of half and half and it turned out much better (and cooked much faster). I tried it again using 1 1/2 cups condensed milk (instead of half and half) to try to get a silkier consistency, almost like a Key lime pie. It turned out really well, but now it is a little too sweet. I will try it again with the condensed milk, but I will cut down the sugar (and perhaps use a graham cracker crust)",
