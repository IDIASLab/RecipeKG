My only disapointment was that I did not find the coconut milk to have really lent it's flavor to the meat. Next time I will make some extra marinade and baste the chicken as it cooks. We really liked the dipping sauce (also poured it on the basmati rice I had made for this meal yum!) I found there was a \"mising link\" between the chicken and the sauce. It liked it's sweetness but I think next time I will tie the 2 items together by adding fresh ginger both to the marinade and to the dipping sauce.",

I used a whole can of coconut milk and even though it marinated overnight it didn't seem to come through. However it created a very tender piece of meat and in the future I might play with the level and combination of ingredients. I used chicken breast meat and cut them into bite-sized pieces and skewered them over the grill. The sauce didn't seem to have as much appeal. The flavour from the chicken itself is probably good enough to stand on its own.",
