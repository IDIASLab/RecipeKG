I added a dash of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Very good recipe, Carol!",

I am an apple pie maker and when I made the filling mixture it didn't look right to me. I did add a few more cherries but it still was not enough. I used a 9\" pie plate as instructed but the cherries sat way too low. The finished pie was delicious but too sweet and I love sweet. I did check a bunch of other recipes after I made this and the smallest amount of cherries called for were 4 cups with most being 6 cups/ 2pounds. I did look at the some of the other reviews before makings and no one mentioned this. HELP..WHAT DID I DO WRONG? I won't be making this again.",
