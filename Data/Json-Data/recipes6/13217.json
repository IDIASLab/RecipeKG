I'm not a huge pie person, but I LOVED this. It is so rich and delicious. I changed a few things - I omitted the nuts and 1/4 c. butter and used a large-sized graham cracker crust (because I hate pastry crust.) \n\nTIP: Many people complain that the chips sink to the bottom. With about 20 minutes left to cook, I just dropped about 20-30 additional chocolate chips on top of the pie. These didn't sink and made it look like a giant chocolate-chip cookie. Way cute...",

I was very skeptical as it was cooking, because it took about fifteen minutes longer than the recipe called for, and it looked strange when it came out of the oven (very shiny and smooth, and an odd tan color--not what I was expecting).  It actually created a layer pie--the chocolate sunk to the bottom, and created a chewy layer over the top.  Based on my husband's reaction, I think I'll have to make this pie again and again!!",

I will use a deep dish pie shell next time (the contents oozed over onto the roasting pan in the oven) and I used mostly milk chocolate chips with some semi-sweet; used pecans instead of walnuts based on what was on hand - my favorite pie now!
