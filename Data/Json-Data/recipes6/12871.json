This recipe seems like to fly by if you have a partner helping you. Also the tip with taping 4 forks together is a HUGE time saver with pricking your dough. Also they need to be only lightly golden. They are extremely fragile but that is the joy in them.. melting in your mouth!!! When it comes to frosting them... I used the buttercream frosting recipe halfed it and made green frosting and red frosting as well as some white. But use your imagination and use jelly as somebody else suggested or even a lemon filling would be awesome!!",
