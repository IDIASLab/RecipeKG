I thought this recipe was really great if for no other reason that I botched it a bit and it still got rave reviews. I accidentally put in 1 cup butter instead of the advised 3/4 cup. It was very dense but for it being a peanut butter cake, I don't think that's a total failure. If I make this again I would probably not add the extra 1/4 cup butter but it certainly wasn't dry like the other reviews have warned.  Also, I really loved the filling! My only complaint is that I wasn't so much a fan of the frosting part as the filling. The peanut butter filling is SO EASY and really fancies up the cake. I felt the frosting left a little bit to be desired. Mine came out not too chocolaty. I was afraid it wouldn't be strong enough to couple well with the all that peanut butter so be prepared with a chocolate frosting back up if you like a richer chocolate taste. However, I'll use this recipe again for the cake and filling. Excellent. ",
