I enjoy these and they aren't too difficult but I have to say that our house prefers Bread and Butter Pickles II on this site to these. I think it may be the addition of peppers to the others as well as the different spices that makes it for us but we still enjoy these a lot. Very sweet good pickles for sandwiches or burgers. The onions in these are pretty good too. Thanks for the recipe!",

I also used powdered cloves because my whole cloves were not to be found. I sliced celery instead of celery seed because the store was out. My 5-year old granddaughter loved it so much I sent a couple of jars home with her. Changes or not it was excellent. I made another batch with fewer onions and plan on making more this summer.",
