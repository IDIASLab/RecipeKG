I found that I needed a lot more mayo than 1 tbsp - I used well over half a cup for 4 heaped cups of bagged slaw mix. Also used about 1/2 tsp of sugar because I am not keen on sweet slaw. Finally I used celery salt instead of plain because I like the flavor. This turned out to be a very tasty colorful dish that I am sure I will make again. Thanks Bluewoulf!",

This made a very colorful mix! I also don't like sweet slaws so I tasted before I added the sugar then tasted again after adding the sugar. It wasn't sweeter but it was definitely better!
