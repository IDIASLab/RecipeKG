Browned the brats, then the veggies and added the brats back in with the rest of the ingredients.  Super easy, and quick to assemble.  My family loved it.  I thought it was pretty tasty.  I think I will add a little hot pepper flakes to mine next time.  I think it would work with some kind of spicy smoked sausage as well.  I might try that next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

No time to cook in the morning so I threw all of this into my crock pot just before bed left it on low till noon the next day when we served it up with some good bread from a local bakery. Everyone raved over it! I used half bratwurst and half Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand. I cut them into 6 pieces each so they'd be a little closer to bite sized. Other than that I did it just as the recipe calls for. Oh except I stirred the flour into some of the broth and didn't add the extra cup of water.",
