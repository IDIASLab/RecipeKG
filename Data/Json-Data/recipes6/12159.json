It sounded to me like I needed to put the cherries inside the dough--hubby looked at them and said \"That's not the way my mom always made them!\" Ooops! I had to find a picture online to see what he was talking about.:p This recipe BARELY makes 24 if you make small-ish balls of dough. So don't cut 24 cherries in half only cut 12. In my oven they came out still white but nice and cooked at 11 minutes so watch to make sure you don't overbake.",
