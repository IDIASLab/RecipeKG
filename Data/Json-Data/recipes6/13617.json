Lots and lots and lots of syrup goes into this one folks so forget the diet. I used a 10\" graham cracker pie crust and the filling fit perfectly. I'd recommend 10\" over 9\" if you choose to not make your own crust to avoid spillage. The maple flavor did not overpower the rest of the pie's ingredients and added a different spin on the standard pecan pie recipe.",
