But easy to make.\" The salsa verde really took over this entire crockpot of chili making it less than enjoyable for us to eat. I followed the recipe exactly, except using a can of crushed tomatoes instead of puree (close enough, if not same), homemade chicken stock instead of veg broth, and a chicken that I'd cooked, shredded and frozen into meal-time portions ahead of time (that had produced said chicken stock.) If I made again, I would saute the onions and peppers in olive oil, adding garlic, prior to putting in the crockpot, and would sub small cans of diced green chiles instead of the salsa verde.",
