What would you expect when the creator said that this was a version of pecan pie which is very sweet in itself? As for the macadamia nuts...yes they are on the pricey side but no one ever said that you couldnt substitute them for another cheaper kind of nut. I have made this twice - once with macadamian nuts and the other 50/50 with macadamian and toasted pecans. Both times this pie was sweet rich and oh so yummy!! You definitly want to have a big glass of milk to drink with this heavenly delight!",
