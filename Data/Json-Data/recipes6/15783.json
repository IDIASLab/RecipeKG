Note - Baking Soda already has some Cream of Tarter, or similar acidic leavening in it, and this may be the reason Cream of Tarter may be left out without too noticeable an effect. Also note all dry ingredients should be mixed THROUGHLY before adding liquids.\n\nFinally, note there is a TIME LIMIT of about 15 to 20 minutes from the time you have added liquid to Baking Powder until you start baking them for Baking Power to have its best leavening(rising)affects. So be sure to preheat oven so its ready for baking when bisquits mixed and ready",

Thanks for the awesome recipe!  It's so forgiving, as I made many changes.  I used half whole wheat flour and half ap flour; accidentally doubled the sugar; left out the cream of tartar; used 1 teaspoon salt (since I was not using butter); used olive oil instead of butter; used rice milk instead of milk.  They turned out tender and delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing!",

However I also substituted 1 cup of the all purpose flour for a cup of whole wheat white flour and in my experience you need a little extra leavening when you do that, so I added about 1/3 of a tsp more of baking powder. I dropped teaspoonfuls of the dough over  a homemade simmering berry/apple compote to make berries and dumplings. I left the lid off for a few minutes to promote lightness then put the lid on, turned it down to very low and simmered for about 12 minutes. (You check them with a fork to see if the insides are cooked yet.) Mmmmm, they turned out great! (Drop biscuits generally make fabulous dumplings. I use them for chicken and dumplings too, but today we wanted something sweet.) I wasn't sure about the melted butter thing, but I was in a hurry to feed the kids before school so I tried it and I'm glad I did. Oh, and I baked up about 1/3 of the dough as biscuits because I didn't need it all for the dumplings. They also were lovely. TIP: if you smooth over the bumpy lumpies on the drop biscuits before baking with a silicone brush dipped in melted butter, people won't even know you used a drop biscuit recipe AND the butter makes the outsides crust up a teeny bit and sooo yummy!",
