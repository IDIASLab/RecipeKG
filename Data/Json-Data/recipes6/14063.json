I decreased the baking time to 20 minutes and they turned out perfect. Thanks again for the great recipe!",

Make the pumpkins squares as shown, in a 9 x 13 pan, then make a glaze..1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup buttermilk, and cook on the stove, adding some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, or maybe some pumpkin pie spice.  Bring to boil and cook for about 4 minutes.  Take off stove and add 1 tsp vanilla.  Pour hot glaze on hot cake and allow to totally cool.  Then add cream cheese icing...This is the best best pumpkin cake ever.  You could add nuts to the icing if you were sure everyone eating it likes nuts.. YUM!!!",
