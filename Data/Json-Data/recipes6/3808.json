Followed the recipe except for baking into muffins rather than a loaf. I always bake muffins at 350\u00ba so I bumped up the temp a bit and they were done in about 20 minutes (ended up with 11). These are moist tasty muffins but if I make these again I will substitute half of the brown sugar with granulated white sugar. The banana flavor mingles well with the chocolate chips and it s a treat when you bite into one of those soft chips. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
