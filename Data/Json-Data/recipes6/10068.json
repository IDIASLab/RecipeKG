Familiar and delicious, I can still remember watching my mother prepare it and saying to her, \u201cPut more pickles in Mom\u201d (which I did, cuz I knew it was what I had to do).  She didn\u2019t use a recipe, nor does this one require you follow it precisely either.  I\u2019m sure the submitter wouldn\u2019t mind if maybe you used all ingredients in amounts to suit your taste buds, like the mayonnaise or mustard for instance. Or more celery if you like a little more crunch.  (I\u2019ll bet she doesn\u2019t measure precisely, but was forced to specify measurements for purposes of following recipe submission guidelines.  I\u2019ll bet, for instance, that she just uses a good plop or two of mayonnaise and maybe a squirt or two of mustard)  In my case, tinkering with this  a bit meant adding a little sour cream to mellow out the mayonnaise and substituting dill pickle juice for the vinegar, tho\u2019 there\u2019s not a darn thing wrong with the vinegar.  I added very thinly sliced radishes and chopped cucumber, because Mom did.  Some chopped green onion gave this just the flecks of color it needed.  Most important, just as Mom did, I tasted it about five or six times (clean spoon every time!) to make sure it was just right.  I\u2019d call this recipe \u201cOld Reliable.\u201d",

Used more pepper, threw a little celery salt in there, and topped it with paprika.  Honestly, everyone else is right - eyeball it, taste it - you'll be fine!",
