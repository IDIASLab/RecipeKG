I did reduce the baking powder by half (this is still probably more than necessary for 12 muffins) and doubled the cinnamon- both on the advice of other reviewers. I thought it was interesting that this recipe has no milk maybe a splash wouldn't hurt. Also I used 1/2 golden raisins and 1/2 dried figs instead of the dates. It was a good choice. The inside of the muffin is nice and moist very muffin-like denseness. However I slightly overcooked mine. so the outside was a bit chewy. Thank you for a good way to use up bananas",
