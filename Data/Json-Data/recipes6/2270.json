I used all whole wheat flour reduced the eggs to 2 used orange juice for the applesauce since I had exactly 2/3 cup after juicing the clementines use melted butter for the oil and reduced the leavening to 2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda as I am really sensitive to the taste of them. I made mini muffins recipe yielded 36 muffins that baked at 425 for 3 minutes and 350 for 9 minutes. The muffins are very tasty have a nice crumb and are moist thanks for a keeper Lindsay:)",
