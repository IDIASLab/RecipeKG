SOOOOO GOOD! If I wasnt pregnant I would love to crack a red stripe beer and enjoy! You could mix up the vegetable adding sweet peppers etc. I also added maybe a few teaspoons more of water but I am assuming that is because my hubby didnt measure the flour proper. The amount of water / flour is basically spot on! I made my quite thick so I did cook about 7-8 min on each side and I also used olive oil, also all I had. I only boiled the fish for 5 min as directed and the amount of salt was perfect. Oh, I did add 1 teaspoon of vegetable bouillion as well - just for a tad more flavour! Hubby had 7 I had 3.. all gone in 5 min max!",
