He had a lot of green beans and cherry tomatoes so I found this recipe on the ingredient search.  I omitted the garlic salt and saut\u00e9ed 2 cloves of garlic and a small shallot (like another reviewer) in the butter and then added the tomatoes.  I then added salt, pepper and basil and then I placed the green beans in the skillet so they could get a little of the spices cooked in them.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

Easy to prepare, BEAUTIFUL to present, good for you -- what's not to like? I steamed fresh green beans, sauted slivered garlic cloves in the butter, used grape tomatoes sliced in halves (less watery than cherry). I tossed the steamed beans into the butter & garlic concoction and sauteed a bit more, then added the tomatoes when I turned off the heat, so they simply picked up the warmth of the already prepared dish, and did not actually \"cook\" and get mushy. Fabulous, and THANK YOU for this one!",

I used Haricots Verts and five minutes cooked them to the \"just tender\" stage I prefer.
