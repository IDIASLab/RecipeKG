Fell completely apart instead of being able to cut into slices. Also had too much filler. Next time I will keep the tomato sauce skip the water and cut bread crumbs in half. I would suggest making a loaf and cooking in a lasagna pan so that the grease can drain away. Update: I originally rated a 3 as it was too moist. I think the problem was that I used storebought breadcrumbs. Have to change it to 5 which is how it came out with modifications due to not using homemade breadcrumbs. (half the breadcrumbs sauce instead of juice and no water) The topping is amazing even if you use a different recipe you must try the topping!",

The \"trigger\" ingredient was the liquid smoke. I also added 1/4 cup more onions a clove of crushed garlic & 1 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce as per other reviews. I substituted diced tomatoes for the juice as that's all I had on hand (it was fine). Due to the use of venison I added 2 Tbs of bacon grease & an additional egg. (The kids all used ketchup on it because they always do but we adults did not.) I like a \"brown-gravy\" based meatloaf vs. tomatoe based which is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars. The rest of the family gave it 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe Carolyn!!",
