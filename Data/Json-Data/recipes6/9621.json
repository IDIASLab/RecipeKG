I have been a vegetarian for 18 years, so I substitued the ground beef with Morningstar Crumbled Grillers...once you add all of the spices and other ingredients, you can't even tell the difference. My husband loved it...he ate the entire pizza by himself. The only thing I would suggest is that you use your favorite salsa, as much of the flavor comes from this one ingredient. This recipe is a new staple in our house. Thank you.",

You pour off a lot of the flavor of the garlic and onions that way.  Saut\u00e9 your G&O's first, set aside on plate then add beef to pan, brown, drain and mix together with G&O.  Great dish!!",
