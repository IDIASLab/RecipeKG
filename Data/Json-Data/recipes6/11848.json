The oil was drenching them and driping down my fingers so that wasn't a good choice! But I made them again today with butter instead of shortening and used 1/4 c less butter than it called for (shortening) and doubled the recipe because last time they were very thin. These were excellent!!! They would be good with nuts. Maybe even chocolate chips because they are not very chocolatey. But so simple and they really did have a great flavor. Just don't use oil and use less butter/shortening than the recipe calls for.",

I used butter for the shortening added some chopped walnuts a teaspoon of coffee crystals and a dash of salt. Baked an extra 10 min. in an 8x8 pan. Think they need more cocoa because they look a little light. Didn't wait for them to cool but they were pretty good warm with a glass of milk crispy on the top but a bit gummy inside. Not your classic brownie flavor but I'd probably make them again in a 9x9 pan. Hubby said that he'd like them more well done.",
