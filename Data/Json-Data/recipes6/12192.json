I did half the recipe and chopped up milk chocolate kisses ghiradella semi sweet chocolate and some nice dark chocolate. It was a nice treat to go all out and use the good chocolates for these cookies. I'm sure using average chocolate would still make a great cookie. I did cream the butter and sugars then added the egg and vanilla and gradually added in the flour mixture with blended oatmeal. I dropped by heaping tbsp onto sheets(didn't flatten with a fork) and needed to bake for 9 minutes and they were perfect. 6-8 minutes and they were too raw and not ready to come out yet. Thanks!",

Because of the chips I used I also used about 3/4 tsp almond extract. I used a cup of cherry chips a cup of raspberry chips and 2 cups of bittersweet chocolate chips. These were full of chips so I skipped the german chocolate chunks on top. I made good-sized golfball scoops of dough and the cookies spread just enought without spreading into each other so they maintained a good thickness. I found I had to bake them for about 9 minutes though and my oven bakes hot so I think I must have made the cookies a bit bigger than recommended. The ground oats give a really nice texture and subtle nutty taste to the cookie. I really like the dough and think you can use the dough as a good base for several different kinds of cookies. On another note I used my kitchenaid mixer and the cookie dough really almost overflowed so be aware of that; I might make it in halves next time.",
