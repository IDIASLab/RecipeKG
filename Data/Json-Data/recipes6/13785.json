They are airy, spongy, light, and a little sweet! There is no need to add more flour, so don't read other reviews and automatically add tons more flour. I added a little to the spoon as I was putting them into the muffin tins but that's it! If you add a cup or more of flour, of course you're going to have more dense rolls!!

I don't specialize in bread but rather sweets so when it came to dinner tonight and our standard loaf of bread in the kitchen had gone moldy I was scrambling to find a quick yeast bread to put on the plate next to my stuffed pork loin. I found this and boy am I glad I did!!! What an easy recipe and SO tasty for the tiny effort they took. The other reviews that state that the dough was \" too sticky\" simply did not know that this kind of quick yeast dough is supposed to be a gloppy mess before they bake. When you mix this stuff up in the bowl it will look like very sticky cake batter....that's fine, don't freak out. Just let it rise as stated and when you SCOOP it into the muffin tin after the first rise use a large scoop. yes, will still be  very gloppy but still continue on. Let them rise a second time and then bake as stated. Mine were a golden brown on top and so buttery on the inside. Stick with the recipe JUST AS WRITTEN and don't worry that you can't kneed this dough...it's not that kind of dough. You will be richly rewarded if you try this one.",

My husband and I ate every one BEFORE they made it to the dinner table.  I did have to make some adjustments, but they came out wonderful!  I had to add a little more flour because the dough was too wet and I used margarine instead of shortening because I was out of shortening.  They still came out great!  I let them rise about an hour, then rolled them in 2 inch balls in a 9x13 pan instead of a muffin tin.  They came out kind of square shaped and I just pulled them apart very easily.  I am making them again today, and doubling the recipe!! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe that I will make over and over again!",

The dough stays sticky and wet throughout the process- I don't even worry about the usual process of shaping into a ball and greasing with oil before it rises- I just knead it with the dough hook on the Kitchenaid and then just leave it all sticky in the bowl to rise.  It works out fine every time.  When I have added extra flour to thicken the dough up a bit, it tends to produce a heavier/more dense roll.  I substitute butter for the shortening, maple syrup for the sugar (when I remember to do so, I try to cut back on the water a little bit to accommodate the extra liquid) and I use home-milled whole wheat flour for all of the white flour called for.  We eat them all the time and I have even begun giving them out to neighbors and friends each week as they are requested.",

I substituted 3 tablespoons honey for the sugar, reduced the water to 2/3 cup; made it with 1-3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 3/4 cups white flour (as per the suggestion of another reviewer); this made the outcome perfect.
