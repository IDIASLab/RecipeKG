I halved the recipe and made 30 mini muffins instead of regular muffins and made the recipe as stated except added the cinnamon to the batter instead of doing a cinnamon/sugar topping. (Omitted the white sugar altogether.) I used baby applesauce for a smooth texture. Mini muffins at 400 in a nonstick mini muffin pan were cooked in about 8 1/2 minutes. Next time I would add about 1/4 tsp. salt. I did not find these muffins to be overly dense--mine were spongey and pretty light. I diced the peaches very fine (again for my 1-year old) and I will freeze most of them for her to snack on later.",

Also I don't think the cinnamon sugar on top is worth the mess and effort. It just falls off. I may try adding a bit of cinnamon to the batter when I make these again which I will.

I wanted a recipe that didn't take regular milk as I was out and had some 'yogurt milk' which is a drink found in Middle eastern stores similar to buttermilk. When I took it out of the fridge I realized my husband had bought the 'mint' flavored so I was in a quandry. I spotted two containers of blueberry non-fat yogurt. I used 1 cup of the blueberry yogurt. I did add 3/4 tsp. salt to the batter. Only had regular rolled oats and it worked fine. Surprisingly this time of year I had to very ripe nice flavor peaches. The taste was incredible. I could taste the peach throughout. Diced them fine. (2 good size peaches=1cup) 2 mini muffin pans at 10 min. baking time and 3 giant-sized muffins. Added tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/4 tsp. cardamom to the topping and it was wonderful. I did find like other reviewers however that the topping doesn't stick well. Maybe try adding it a bit before recommended time next time. These had a wonderful taste and not sickening sweet. Light and fluffy.",
