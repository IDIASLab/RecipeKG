First of all the amount of bacon fat was not enough to cook all that cabbage (which was a tiny head) - I should have stopped right there and started to make changes - but I didn't. The cabbage starting sticking to the bottom of the pan because there wasn't enough fat and the cabbage was weighed down by the corn bread mixture (which was not a lot of corn bread mixture for the small cabbage - thank goodness). I finally had to intervene and add some oil - I should have added butter. Anyway if I ever cooked this again which I doubt I would forget the corn bread mix and just add the cayenne pepper. I will continue to look for more ways to cook cabbage but anyone looking at this recipe might try \"Indiana-Style Fried Cabbage\" which is on this site. We loved it - it has been reviewed by many. Living in the East and never tasting Indiana or Texas Cabbage - my vote is for Indiana. P.S. - Not only were there leftovers - the vote was to deep six the leftovers. That didn't happen when I served the Indiana style.",
