They aren't full of fat and greasy like all the other oatmeal cookie recipes I have tried from this site and for once, the recipe works perfectly fine as is! You don't have to read through a thousand reviews and mark down all the changes you need to make to have it turn out! You can make them as bar cookies or just drop cookies. I had no \"self-rising\" flour so I added 1 tsp of baking powder and used \"salted\" butter, actually I used Becel (a healthy, soft, tub type margerine)and the recipe turned out superb. (Self-rising flour is just regular flour with added baking powder and salt, you will notice baking recipes that call for it usually do not call for baking powder.) I also had to use whole wheat pastry flour (a very fine ground whole wheat flour you will find at a health-food store) because I ran out of all-purpose flour but my kids still gobbled them up! Anyway, thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!",

Don't be alarmed if the center seems underdone.  The top and bottom crisp up as the bars cool, leaving a crisp outside and chewy inside.  For me, at least half the charm was that this recipe was SO easy and baked in so little time, giving almost immediate results.  The flavor was great and this recipe would be very easy to modify if you wanted to add some extra goodies like coconut, toffee bits or chocolate chips of any variety, as well as changing the recipe so that it would be more nutritious.  Don't be afraid to try this one, folks.  It's easy, quick and tastey!",

This made the raisins very plump and juicy. Make sure to drain them before adding them to the mixture. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the cookies and put them on the cookie sheets. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the mix.I also added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. An outsanding cookie very soft and chewy just the way I like them.",
