Used only 2 Tbs. tomato paste, and 1 red bell pepper since that is what I had, large chop.  Additions were:  2 carrots and 2 ribs of celery both sliced on bias, 3 Tbs. minced ginger, 2 chopped and seeded jalapeno peppers for a hint of heat, 4 star anise, and 1 tsp. sesame oil.  Sprinkled ribs with seasoned salt and black pepper before adding the sauce.  Used a large 12\" frying pan with a lid so I  didn't have to fool with covering with foil.  Baked at 350 degrees for 2 hours covered, then 1/2 hour uncovered to reduce sauce.  It was wonderfully full of flavor and will make again.  This was the first time I had made them without browning the ribs first and it didn't seem to make a difference.  However, I did pull the ribs up from the bottom of the pan after removing the lid so they could get a little brown.  Skimmed fat from sauce after removing other ingredients.  UPDATE:  Made again, but simmered on top of the stove.  Increased brown sugar to 2/3 c., vinegar to 1/3 c., and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  Reserved 2 Tbs. pineapple juice to add at end with 2 Tbs. of cornstarch to thicken sauce; and set aside pineapple chunks for later. Added carrots, celery, and bell pepper after 1 hour to preserve flavor and texture; added pineapple chunks after 2 hours; added cornstarch slurry at end, cooked 5 minutes. Flavor is fantastic and better than before.  Cooked extra 30 min. because extra thick ribs",

The only changes I made to the recipe were to use hot banana peppers instead of green peppers because that is all I had on hand (and they worked great, gave a nice little bit of heat) and I used stevia instead of brown sugar.  I served rice on the side and used the sauce over that.  My husband likes things a little spicier so he added some sriracha.  Really yummy.",
