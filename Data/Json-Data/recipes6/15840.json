I have never made a more beautiful and perfect souffle although I must admit I used some of my own instincts since the cooking instructions were not very clear. I did use a 1/8 cup less sugar as others suggested.  When I mashed the carrots they were still lumpy so at the very end, before pouring the carrots into the casserole dish, I put it all in the blender and blended it until smooth.  I think that made all the difference in the world.  It rose beautifully and did not fall. Can't wait to have company to show this dish off.  Thanks submitter!",
