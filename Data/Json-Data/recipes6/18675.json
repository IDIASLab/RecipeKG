First, I replaced the oil with butter. I make a few different kinds of biscotti, and I've never seen a recipe call for oil. I figured the butter would be tastier. Second, to ensure a crucnchy yet not-too-hard texture, I mixed the ingredients according to most biscotti recipes I've tried. I mixed all the dry ingredients, incuding the sugar. Then I cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembled course crumbs. In a seperate bowl, I lightly beat the eggs and the molasses together. I added this to the dry mix. I mixed this concoction until it was just combined. No overmixing! The dough should still be crumbly. I divided the dough in half and formed them into their log shapes on the cookie sheets. It's still pretty crumbly at this point, but it all firms up when you bake it. This looser dough allows the biscotti to cook up crunchy without being dense or hard. I think that's the reason some people ended up with tough cookies. You have to keep the dough kinda loose. Anyway, when I finsihed the baking process, I dipped them in white chocolate. Deliciousness.",

I omitted the whole wheat flour and ended up using about 4 cups white flour to get the right consistancy.  I also added a teaspoon vanilla and used 3 1/2 t. Pampered Chefs Cinnamon Plus instead of all the seasonings, it's just easier as it has all of them in it.    Next I divided into 3 logs and rolled them in Raw sugar mixed with a little cinnamon then flattened them.  It gave it a nice look after baking.  The easiest way to make biscotti is to bake on a Pampered Chef Bar stone(yes there is a difference in stones) They won't burn and when you bake the 2nd time, you just stand them up about 1/2 inch apart and don't have to flip them.  I'm not sure if I will do any white chocolate on them or not.  They do look pretty the way they are.",

                "reviewBody": "Nice crispy, crunchy, spicy little treats. I followed the recipe as written with the oil, because butter is not normally used in genuine Italian biscotti, which never have a buttery taste. Those who think these taste bland might benefit from the addition of 1/2 tsp salt. Also, adding 1/4 tsp baking soda will keep the spices from giving a slightly bitter edge. If you want the spiciness to have a kick, 1/8 tsp black pepper or a couple of good shakes of cayenne will accomplish what you're looking for. I baked for exactly the time specified (25 minutes,) sliced and baked another 7 minutes per side. They came out properly light, dry and crunchy. Also avoided overmixing, which kept them from turning out tough. Painted the bottoms with white chocolate. Also, used half Splenda and half sugar. Delicious!",

The only other change I made was to lower the temperature to 325 degrees for the second baking. I put them in for 10 minutes on each side. The recipe was hard to follow because I had to make adjustments for the spices. They are written in fractions of a tablespoon and my measuring spoons are not that size. The ground ginger at 1 1/2 tablespoons would be 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons...the cinnamon at 3/4 tablespoon would be 2 1/4 teaspoons....the ground cloves at 1/2 tablespoon would be 1 1/2 teaspoons..the nutmeg is fine! I hope this helps others so you don't have to figure it out. (and myself the next time I make it. lol) The biscotti is so good the recipe is still worthy of 5 stars! The aroma of this baking will knock your socks off! Thank you Cristina for sharing. It is being included in my assortment of biscotti Christmas gifts.",
