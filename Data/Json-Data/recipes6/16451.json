The main thing is to try to make sure everything is as sanitized as possible and go for a recipe that has a sugar:water ratio of 2:1.",

You want the water to be supersaturated so you'll need a 2:1 sugar to water ratio. You have to heat the water in a saucepan to do this. You also do not want to use foil or plastic wrap to cover it. You need the water to evaporate some and it'll take longer to make the crystals. If you use a tupperware container rock candy will form on the sides of the container and they're really hard to get off. Don't forget to 'seed' the skewers/string by rolling sugar onto them. However you'll need to have the sugar water cooler than room temperature so that you don't just dissolve the sugar.",
