This recipe has the same flavor but it doesn't look the same or have the same consistency as you would get in a restaraunt. But who cares! It tastes wonderful! I made the rice with my rice cooker and made it exactly as written except I used Jasmine rice because it's all I had on hand. Next time I will use less sugar - that much sugar really made the rice a bit \"watery\". I've seen recipes for this dish that are more difficult - steaming sticky rice and boiling the coconut milk with sugar and salt to thicken it. But I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because of how easy it was to make.",
