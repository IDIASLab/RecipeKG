Maybe I overbeat it but there was SO much batter the cake almost over-ran the pan. You MUST serve this cake warm or re-warmed... SO scrumptious!! I was tempted to over-decorate with chopped nuts or powdered sugar but when you see the serving and how understated it is it only adds to the spectacular surprise taste and texture. Definitely reserve some syrup and glaze to serve on the side (warmed).",
