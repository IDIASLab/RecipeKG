Do use parchment paper, but otherwise there is nothing tricky or difficult or fussy about these cookies.  I had requests for another batch before I had finished washing up from the first one!",

I'd been having trouble getting the right consistency in the finished cookie, though...I would end up having to throw out half the batch (never seem to set up). But the flavor is so awesome that I kept trying til I got it right. Definitely, the trick to these cookies is to let the dough sit at LEAST 45 minutes before scooping/baking. Now they're coming out perfect every time. Totally decadent cookie.",

This was definitely worth the work to make.",

Good quality chocolate is key to a great cookie. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet & added 1 cup of chocolate chips-semisweet one time and milk chocolate the other time. Dutch process cocoa is a must too. Droste is the brand I use and it's got a great flavor. If you don't wait too long between melting the chocolate & adding it to the sugar mixture the dough won't get too stiff when you mix in the flour. Once the dough is all mixed letting it sit for half an hour will let the chocolate firm up and not be too difficult to roll into balls.",
