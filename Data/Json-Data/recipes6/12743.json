This is my first attempt at making biscotti & I was a little intimidated.  I am happy to say that making biscotti is so EASY!  I followed the directions of the recipe except I didn't have orange zest.  Instead, I added 1-2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier.  The biscotti was a HUGE hit.  I tested it at a party  & everyone thought I should sell it to Starbucks---so much fresher and tastier!  After mixing the dough, I let it sit in the mixing bowl for 10-12 minutes so that it could set up.  It made it easier to handle (wet hands helped with the stickiness).  Also, I baked the biscotti dough on Silpat sheets and had no problems with sticking.  I used a serrated knife & had no problems slicing the biscotti.  Also, I added a few extra minutes to the second baking because I like a drier biscotti.  I can't wait to experiment with more biscotti recipes!!",

Spreading the chocolate on each cookie was a bit time-consuming so on my subsequent batches I laid out all the cooled cookeies cut side up on the baking sheet. I put the slightly cooled melted chocolate in a cake decorating bag with a plain tip and \"squiggled\" it over the cookies. It was fast looked great and there was just enough chocolate on each cookie to enhance the orange flavor without overpowering it.",

(I didn't dip them later) Not crazy about orange zest but it really adds flavor. Don't leave it out - unless of course you are adapting it to a lemon poppy seed biscotti or something like that. The possiblilities are endless! I also only made one large loaf and because I like a real crisp biscotti I turned down the oven to 200 degrees and just let them hang out for about 30 extra minutes at the end. Turned off the oven and let them cool there. Didn't get any darker at 200 either. YUM!",

I had to leave out almonds due to an allergy I used anise flavoring instead of the orange zest b/c I did not have any on hand - the anise is my favorite hint of flavor in biscotti so it seemed right. Also I used half whole wheat flour and half AP white flour and THAT really worked too. I normally to change a recipe so much before trying the original but this is just so forgiving. Oh the most important part is - EVERYONE loved it. My sunday school class my mother my 3yr old daughter... I had Nonni's biscotti there to (to fall back on just in case mine was terrible) but everyone went for mine first. I love that! Thank you so much the recipe is delish!

This biscotti was more dense and subtle in sweetness, and stronger in vanilla taste (yum)than most that I've bought. The best feature is that it certainly proclaims \"FRESHLY BAKED\".  I will, however, begin to add different things to this fairly basic recipe (such as hazelnut, cocoa, etc) to be able to offer choices to our overnight guests for their breakfast coffee.  The only step I improved upon as I did more and more is the spreading chocolate on the finished biscotti.  I scooped a spoonful, poured it along the bottom side of the biscotti, then scraped it with backside of butterknife to make even, thin layer.  Be sure to let the chocolate set (fridge for 20 min worked well for me).  Mangia!",

I used fresh orange zest and put the choc chips in the batter (1/2c) so I wouldn't have to mess with dipping afterward. Also I did not toast the almonds. I think the zest and untoasted almonds are too chewy. And choc chips make it too sweet. Smells fantastic and tastes nice but I didn't reach for a third like I did the others. Will try again with those modifications. Be sure to flatten it out to 1/2\" high b4 baking. Yield for me was 48 1/2\" pieces.",
