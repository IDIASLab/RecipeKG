                "reviewBody": "I had a couple slices of bacon that needed to be used up so I cut them into small pieces browned in a skillet and added to the beans. Unless you don't eat meat consider adding the bacon as it added another layer of flavor. I knew for our tastes 1 cup of brown sugar would make this way too sweet (personal taste preference) so I used 1/2 cup which was spot on. I also used Spanish tomato sauce (has a kick to it) which not only elevated the flavor but was a good counterbalance to the sweet brown sugar. The recipe instructs you to drain only the kidney and lima beans so that's what I did. After an hour baking the beans were still WAY too soupy. I removed the foil put the dish back into the oven and cooked for another 20-25 minutes to reduce the liquid. I d suggest you drain all four cans of beans reserving some of the liquid add a reasonable amount back to the bean mixture and then they should be good-to-go in an hour. I served this as a side dish not a one dish meal. We love beans and really enjoyed this combination of beans; nice change from traditional baked beans. Wmahailet thanks for sharing your recipe.",
