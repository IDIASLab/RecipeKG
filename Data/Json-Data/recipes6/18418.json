It was dry not very flavorful and hard to cut through the apples. Fortunately however there was way too much food brought in to school so my son brought home some leftovers. Let me just say this cake definitely improves with age!!!! On day 2 the cake was so moist and flavorful and the apples softened nicely which made for easier cutting. Yummmmm!!!! I think I've gained 5 pounds. If you're looking for a simple dessert that's not overly sweet and has a nice presentation try this one. I followed the recipe exactly using a mix of Granny Smith and Jonagold apples. I baked two cakes for 35 minutes and the other two a little longer. Next time I'll stick with 35 minutes. They were just right.",

I didn't change a thing other than using rice milk and a blob of sour cream instead of the cream (whey allergy). Talk about easy! I love recipes that can be mixed up quickly tossed in the oven and ready in less than an hour. I did have to bake it for an extra 15 mins but I think my oven is a bit off. I used Jonamac apples and they came out tart and juicy and did not get mushy at all. I'd love to try different types of apples such as Granny Smith Cortland or Honeycrisp. Next time I might make a double layer of apples just because I love apple desserts so why not pack as many apples in there as possible? The cake part is not very sweet but I love that because the topping and apples balance out the sweetness. Some fruit desserts are too sugary and sticky but this one is perfect. Clean simple flavor that will surely be a dessert I will make again and again. I'd love to try pears or peaches next time. You must make this cake you will love it!!! Thank-you so much for posting the recipe.",
