The changes I made were - 1 1/2 cups frozen fresh peas - put into the pot with the macaroni, just before I drained it.  Then ran everything under cold water in a strainer to cool it quickly.  I sliced several green onions and added diced dill pickle.  I used only 2/3 cup mayo thinned with a little dill pickle juice and mixed in a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar - this made the \"dressing\" creamier.  In addition to the sprinkle of paprika, I added a sprinkle of dried dill and cracked black pepper.  I refrigerated it for 4 hours and the flavor was wonderful.  Next time I will add some shredded or diced cheddar cheese to it as well.  Thank you for the basics Peach822, it's a great stepping off point.",

I decided that I would try something new to make for my husband so he might finally decide he likes mac salad.\n\nIt took every ounce of energy for me to not take a big bowl for myself and eat it right there and then.\n\nI followed the recipe almost exactly. I realized I only had a little bit of relish left, so I decided to dice up a pickle. I filled each TBLS with the finely diced pickle and then filled the rest of the spoon with the pickle juice. I did this twice, the recipe called for 2 TBLS of relish.\n\nI decided to add 2 diced eggs to the salad and I boiled 4 more and made deviled eggs as a garnish.\n\n\nI had to add a litte more mayo and I think the reason is because I had a 16oz box of macaroni. I guessed at the 12oz measurement, but I may have been over a little bit.\n\nThis recipe is perfect. I can't wait for my hubby to try it tomorrow. I think this might be one that he finally likes :)\n\nI will post again tomorrow and give his opinion. I think it is absolutely delicious.\n\n\n*edited to add... My husband LOVED IT!  I finally asked him what he thought. \"I like it. It's pretty good.\" That's a 5 star rating coming from him.\n\nI promised to make this mac salad from now on.\n\nHe hates Macaroni salad so if he liked it, well you decide from there. BTW everyone else raved about it. It was really good. This is gonna be my signature mac salad from now on.",
