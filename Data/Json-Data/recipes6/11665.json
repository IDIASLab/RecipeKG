I made 2 of these for Halloween. I think I should have followed other reviewers and used 1/2 cup applesauce 1/2 cup oil. 1 cup of oil is a lot of oil! I frosted the first cake with a homemade buttercream frosting but it sure made the cake sweet. For the second cake I used a powdered sugar drizzle (1 cup powdered sugar 1 Tbl. milk) tinted orange with green sugar sprinkles on the top of the cake then I decorated it with some plastic spiders. Festive! I would definitely used the powdered sugar glaze again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I took previous advice and cut the white sugar to 1 cup added 2/3 cup brown sugar and added 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to the baking soda. Next time I will add an additional 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I also do not care for cloves so I omitted them and added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. as well. It was so yummy covered with cream cheese icing. Also I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan so you will need to cut the baking time down to about 40-45 min. Definitely do not want to overbake this one.",
