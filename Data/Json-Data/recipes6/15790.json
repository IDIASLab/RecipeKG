I also added chunks of avocado for added interest. This is good for an idea when you're stumped for some kind of salad to make. Update, 2/09: This time I eliminated the sugar and the vinegar.  Used olive oil and a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice instead. Now this I loved! Instead of tangy and sweet it was light and refreshing.  A definite do-over!",

Halved the cucumber lengthwise peeled and seeded it before slicing it. Subbed homegrown cubed kohlrabi for 1/2 of the cucumber. Increased the onion slightly and decreased the tomato a bit. When all done I tasted it and added a touch more balsamic vinegar and some cubed avocado pieces. Refrigerated it several hours before serving. This was THE BEST cucumber-type salad I have ever made and I am sure that it would be excellent as written. However I would stick with my combo of vinegars. DO try this!!!",
