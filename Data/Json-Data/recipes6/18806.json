And it is even more scrumptious with just a little butter on top. I have a sweet potato casserole I make for special occasions because it takes more time but I honestly like this recipe better (and it's healthier than my other recipe). I love the subtle apple taste mixed with the sweet potato. The best thing about it is that it's quick and easy! I ALWAYS make my sweet potatos in the microwave whether eating them plain or in a recipe. For this recipe poke holes in the potatos wrap in a paper towel and cook about 8 minutes. Then just scoop out the flesh and mash. It's super easy and FAST! I've always found it hard to peel sweet potatos so the microwave is a good alternative.",

I don't even think I'll be trying the second recipe...this was the bomb! I added a second apple (and used Cortlands instead of Granny Smith) and also added about 1/3 cup brown sugar. Yum-a-liscious!! I decided to boil them before peeling and was surpised to find out how easily the skins slipped off after boiling.",
