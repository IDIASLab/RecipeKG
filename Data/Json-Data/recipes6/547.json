I think it would be better to top the chicken off with a bit of dressing.. would get more of the flavor since there is a LOT more liquid in this than you'd probably eat. I am going to try shredding this up in a wrap and adding blue cheese to it that way",

I cooked it on high for 4 hours. It took minutes to put together and the chicken was tender. I think shredding it would help with the amount of liquid and possibly serving it with or over rice. Even my pickiest eater liked this. Thank you!",

Honestly I could not follow it completely because other reviewers had said there was too much liquid and also not to add the blue cheese dressing to the liquid use it on the side. I am not sure if that s supposed to be a 64 ounce bottle of V-8? Or a 46 ounce bottle of V-8 my store doesn t sell 46 ounces V8? Either way it was still way too much liquid all the spices and other flavors completely got lost. Because others felt that was too much liquid I only used 32 ounces After I dumped it in it was still too much I ladled out at least a cup if not 2. At the end the flavor was completely lost. And so I added the spices again everything except for the chicken V8 celery and blue cheese. My suggestion is far as flavor would be mix the spice and add the V8 one cup at a time. Until the flavor is to your liking. I m kind of a spicy wimp and it didn t have any kick. And as others suggested it would probably be pretty good shredded but you still wouldn t need that much liquid you can always add more.",
