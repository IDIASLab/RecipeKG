I ended up baking for about 35 minutes.  Take it out while the center is just jiggly.  Also try putting a large pan of water in the oven while preheating and baking.  The moist oven helps cut down on cracks.  Turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven while it cools off to help avoid cracking.  Another reviewer mentioned having trouble with lumps in the cheesecake.  The cream cheese needs to be at room temperature before creaming with the sugar.  That should take care of the lumps. Great recipe and not nearly as time consuming as a traditional cheesecake.",

To those who say that the filling doesn't fill the pie crust up try this; After you have put in all your ingredients into your bowl, beat it with a stand mixer or a hand mixer for a least 12 to 15 min, believe me when I say \"it will be worth your time\" and dedication. Also, use a water bath, of boiling water. Fill  the pan up only to the half way point of your cheesecake. If you over feel the pan your cheesecake will be a total lost I learned that from a friend, but it was a good laugh. Than when the  time is up turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until the oven is cold. Oh yea I toped my cheesecake off with a sauce that I made from strawberries this summer.If I could give it more stars I would.",
