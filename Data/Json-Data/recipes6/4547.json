My only problem is that with the addition of flour it came out too thick and stewy for us. I reckon the starch in the potatoes would thicken the soup enough.

It's a great idea for a soup but just not crazy with the flavor. Either it's missing something or my American taste buds just can't appreciate this foreign recipe. I wish I felt differently. My husband wouldn't eat it he felt even more strongly against the flavor than I did.
