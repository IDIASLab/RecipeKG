Some had their with whipped cream and some with frozen vanilla yogurt while some had one topping with the first serving and the other with the second. I did not add the the raisins (due to family preferences) or the last three spices and we were totally thrilled with the results. Oddly enough I found this recipe on msn.com but could not find it on allrecipes.com!?",
