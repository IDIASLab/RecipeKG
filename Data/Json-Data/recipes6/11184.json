First, instead of gramcracker crumbs i used a whole box of (minus 2 or 3) SANDIES shortbread cookies for the crust. Doubled the butter to go with that. I like thick crust. I added 1/2 C. frozen blueberries to the batter. With the rest of the blueberries i combined them with 1/3 C. Red rasberry jam and 1/3 C. sugar. Mix and set aside. I always cook for the amount of time suggested and then turn my oven off and let the cheese cake cool by it self in the oven for 2-4 hours. I don't get any cracks in the top of my cake that way.\nThank you for a differnt idea (Blueberries) for cheesecake. Mrs. Morrison",

Graham cracker crust is baked for 10 min. @ 350.  Cool before pouring in cheesecake mixture.  For cooking, I didn't try to wrap Springform pan w/foil, I put a cookie sheet with water in it on the bottom rack, and preheated to 350 (same as crust), turn to 250 soon as cheesecake goes in for 1.5 hrs.  Turn off and leave in oven (door closed) for 3 hours for slow cooling.  Refrigerate, then before serving, add blueberries.  I used way more than 1/3 cup jelly! This is an AMAZINGLY good recipe and 3rd time I followed above.  Store bought quality with ALL organic ingredients.  MMMmmm MMM",
