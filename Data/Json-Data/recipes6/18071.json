Also, I substituted canola oil for the lard with no problems. \r\n\r\nI do have to add, I agree with MBUENZLI's review- Country Fried Steak is not supposed to be exploding with flavor. And for anyone having problems with the batter falling off the meat when you fry, make sure your oil is heated enough before adding the meat. I do this by dropping a pinch of flour into the oil. If it bubbles like crazy, its ready!",

It won't taste like chicken gravy but it will have a bit more richness.

It was my first attempt at country fried steak and I think I did a pretty good job, even though I did change the recipe a little bit.  I used buttermilk and one egg and I seasoned the flour more than the recipe called for (with garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika).  After dredging in the milk and flour, I let the steaks sit for about 20 minutes, then I heated canola oil (instead of lard) to cook the steaks in (I also used a cast iron skillet).  The only other change I made was to the gravy.  I doubled the sauce for starters...here's what I did.  After frying the steak, I poured the oil out of the pan, but reserved 1/4 cup and added it back to the pan.  I then whisked in 4 Tbsp of the flour which I'd used for dredging - cooked that a little to cook out the \"floury\" taste.  Then I added 1 cup of 1% milk and 1 cup of whole milk, then I seasoned with about 1 Tbsp of fresh crushed peppercorns and about 1/2 - 1 tsp of salt.  I think the amount of peppercorns was a bit too much, (I would use probably 2 tsp next time).  It was still very good and I will likely make this dish again. The gravy was fantastic and I intend to make it for fried chicken as well.",

Fried steak in butter seasoned (simple salt and pepper with a touch of paprika) coating was nice and crusty and I had no problem with it adhering. Doubled the sauce. Removed steak from the pan onto a warmed plate added a gob of butter melted and an equal amount of flour. Whisked flour into butter to cook out the raw flour taste (a couple of minutes) and SLOWLY add the milk. Flour will seize into an unappetizing ball but don't despair. Keep whisking and slowly adding milk and eventually the mass will soften and loosen to a wonderful gravy. By doing it this way you'll have a gravy that's thickened to your preference. Salt & pepper to taste.",

I do sometimes add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of garlic powder or sometimes a little minced garlic (my Mom's secret;)) and ALWAYS double the gravy as we like lots of gravy for both the top of the meat and for mashed potatoes. Also fantastic over plain sliced bread too! A real southern cookin' favorite. I always use my cast iron skillet for this dish it just seems to taste better and always come out perfect that way for some reason. For those who can't get the batter to stick the cooking oil must be HOT when you add the piece of breaded meat.",
