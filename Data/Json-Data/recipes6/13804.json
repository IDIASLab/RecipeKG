First, I used vegetable stock instead of water, and at first I thought that was a mistake because it started to smell \"vegetable soupish\", but in the end it worked.  I think water would have worked fine too.  I used crushed tomatoes in puree instead of sauce, and like others added the zucchini with the tomatoes as I didn't want it overcooked.  I omitted the sugar and added a grated carrot with the tomatoes - it does the same thing that sugar is meant to do, cut the acidity of the tomatoes, but you also get a bit more nutrition.  And I seasoned with oregano, basil, salt & pepper.  Start to finish, my sauce was done in just under an hour - lentils were tender at about 35 minutes and the sauce simmered for maybe another 20 or so.  It was very filling and delicious!  Will definitely make this again.  ",

Will freeze the rest and probably eat as soup instead of pasta sauce. I used large chunky mushrooms and they held their shape and texture well. The recipe didn't say what kind of lentils to use; I used green which worked well. They cooked thoroughly but didn't disintegrate. Will make again. Update: increased to four stars because it's so yummy as a thick soup with wholemeal bread! Fantastic take-to-work microwave food.",
