I made it as written except I had a 2-lb bag of cranberries so I adjusted all ingredient amounts to 2.5x what is stated and used the whole bag (I have the 6-qt Instant Pot). Making it in the Instant Pot was easy--I didn't have to babysit it. I've never made CB sauce with orange marmalade; I never thought of it before. It's sure easier than grating orange peel! I of course had to sample some while it was still warm. It's tangy and not overly sweet. I suppose those who prefer it sweeter could add more brown sugar but I prefer mine on the tangy side. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
