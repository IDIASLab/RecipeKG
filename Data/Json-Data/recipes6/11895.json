I halved the recipe and used 1/2 T almond extract instead of amaretto as well as used 2 bags of cinnamon instant oatmeal in addition to the regular quick oats as I ran out of them and needed a little bit more oatmeal. I thought they were sweet enough on their own (probably due to the addition of the cinnamon oatmeal) so I didn't put any glaze on top.

I made half of them with an icing and half without and I think the cookies without the icing are better. Plus the proportions recommended for the icing are off. If you use the recommended 2 cups confectioner's sugar and 2 tablespoons amaretto you will get a block of powdered sugar. In order to get something with a drizzly consistency I would recommend something like 3/4 of a cup confectioner's sugar 3 tablespoons amaretto. You could even add vanilla extract or maple syrup to make it more liquidy. (2) Instead of using 1 cup butter I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup butter. I almost always substitute applesauce for shortening when I bake and it only improves the flavor. (3) I increased the flour by 1/2 cup. (4) Instead of mixing the apricots in with the recipe I pushed a dried apricot on top of the cookie as I was putting them on the baking sheet. (5) I added a dash of cinnamon (never hurts right?). I baked the cookies for 8 minutes exactly and they came out great. Chewy and delicious. I think the cookies without icing are five stars but with the icing are only four stars. I think the icing is too sweet and the amaretto flavor overpowers the other flavors in the cookie.",
