I did not soak the noodles in warm water and instead boiled them for 5 minutes like the directions on the noodles indicated before draining them and setting aside for cooking. I did not add bamboo shoots or salt but I did add mushrooms. I plan on adding some red bell peppers and maybe onions next time. It ended up tasty and was quick and easy to make. Also tasted a lot better than chap chae recipes I've had from actual Korean cookbooks. Finally I think that this recipe is more like 2 servings.",
