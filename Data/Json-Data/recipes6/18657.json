Use a large insulated drink cooler to brew it in, and everyone can help themselves using the spigot.  This is best to do outdoors or place the cooler in the kitchen sink as it brews. Dry ice can be dangerous. Be sure to use gloves when handling. Do not allow children to handle the dry ice.",

We made 4 gallons using about 1.75 bottles (2 oz.) of McCormick root beer extract 6-2 liter bottles of club soda for half of the sugar we used dark brown sugar. It had a very rich yummy flavor. We also used 10 pounds of dry ice started off with 5 and it all melted away in an hour. Got 5 more and it stayed icy until the last drop was drained. Made it in one of those gatorade 6 gallon beverage coolers. Excellent!",
