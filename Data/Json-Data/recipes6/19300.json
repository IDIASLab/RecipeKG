The next time I made a batch of cherry I put several drops of peppermint oil in the boiling sugar mixture. As far as cutting and packaging this candy I've cut into squares and I've also handrolled small tubes using confectioner sugar coated hands.",

I used sugarfree cherry jell o and it made no difference (obviously since there's three cups of sugar already!). I'm already considering a batch of lime...
