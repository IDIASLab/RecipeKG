This dressing gets better with time, so if spicy is not your thing, start with a lesser amount of red pepper flakes. My entire family loves it and requests it at almost every meal. - not breakfast, as yet - One daughter who lives out of state heard how great it is and requested the recipe after her sister told her how good this turned out.

It might have been okay with like about 1/3 of the soy sauce it called for but I'm sort of mad that I wasted 7 limes and a bunch of Realime juice.
