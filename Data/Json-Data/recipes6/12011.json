Definitely take note to reviews saying egg whites should be mixed SEPARATELY.  Should mix with mixer until stiff which takes several minutes so don't give up on it!  Then mix in strawberries, lemon j, sugar until strawberries are all blended.  PUT IN SEPARATE BOWL and then insert HEAVY whipping cream found next to milk in store.  Use mixer for a good 3-5 min. until this gets very stiff so when you pull mixer up, it sticks to mixers/handles.  I use 2/3C pecans because they taste better as a crust than walnut and so there is enough to spread on top.  I did use a pan A TAD smaller than 13X9 so it would be thick, but there is plenty filling IF whipped up properly.  Form crust by patting lightly.  Definitely cut, and plate after the 6hrs in freezer, BUT do not serve until 10 minutes later so it doesn't take icy.",

Much better with real whipped cream than with Cool Whip in my opinion but I might try it with fat-free whipped topping and less sugar for a low-fat version sometime. The directions were a little unclear though. I did mix together the crust ingredients and ended up with something more akin to cookie batter than a crumbly crust/topping. But that was okay--I crumbled it as it was cooking and probably saved time over using a pastry fork to cut in the margarine. The other thing is that you have to whip the egg whites alone until they're stiff before adding the other ingredients. I did that wrong the first time. Great recipe! I'll definitely make it again.",
