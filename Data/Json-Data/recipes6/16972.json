I was a little worried as i forgot to put one half cup of the sugar flour mixture in the cake batter. Also I do not have a double boiler so i melted the white choc in microwave. I should have melted it longer because it needs to be very soft for the frosting as my frosting was a bit hard still the cake is tremendous. Next time i want to try that wine cooler in there yummy. This was the yummiest home cooked from scratch I have ever made. Despite the messups it was so good the best ever I am fixing to make this cake for a baby shower Im making three layers light blue icing. I want it to look really nice and I know on some cakes fore the cake to turn out smooth you have to use a certain type of icing. Will this icing work? Do you know how I would also make the decorative icing that goes around the cake using the same recipe? If not ill figure something out. If you check this let me know. I love this recipe",
