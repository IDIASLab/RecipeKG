One note: to me, the point of using the Instant Pot is to save time, so instead of sauteing the vegetables separately, I put them all in the pot after cooking the pork and adding the sauce. Set the pot to 5 minutes like the recipe said and it came out great. Only thing I messed up is I didn't drain the pork after sauteing, the sauce was a little watery for me.",
