And it came out just as fine. Actually it came out great. Everyone in the house loved it and I am willing to make it again.",

I wish the recipe specified the weight of cherries rather than the volume. I used an entire 16-oz package of frozen cherries which measured one and a half cups after halving and thawing; seems like a lot of cherries since that package of frozen cherries measures almost three cups when frozen. I might make this again.",
