I will definately be making this in the future.  Of course, I may also be tempted to try it with raspberries or strawberries...",

Again like a lot of others I didnt put the nuts into the mix but only ontop and added extra. I also poured the mix into a 11 inch cake tin lined with greaseproof and baked for 45 mins it was perfect.  Will use this time and again.",

I made a couple of changes: I used 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb and that seemed a good amt, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil (worked great!), I left the almonds out of the batter and felt the almonds in the topping were enough, I used almond extract instead of vanilla (ok-but I'll use vanilla next time.). My biggest piece of advie on this recipes and any other rhubarb recipe is to NOT bake it in a shiney aluminum baking pan. The rhubarb reacts to the metal and while it doesn't affect the cake, it does damage the pan with spots where ever the rhubarb touches the pan. This was a yummy way to use up rhubarb!",

Can you tell I'm trying to use my food storage too? :)  I think it turned out great, but my husband wanted walnuts instead.",
