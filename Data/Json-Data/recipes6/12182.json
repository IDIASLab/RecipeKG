I added 2 Tbs more brown sugar and 1/2 tsp salt to the flour mixture so the cookies would rise and be fluffy. I also used white chocolate chips instead of the chopped white chocolate. I dealt with the jam by folding it into each individual scoop of cookie dough. It's messy but comes out gorgeous. Thanks!",
