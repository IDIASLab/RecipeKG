To make the cookie more interesting, I used three cups of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal and just used the oats to help thicken it up as it was too runny as other reviews stated. I think these would be awesome with coconut. Made these cookies into heart shapes for my sweeties for VD. Kids and hubby enjoyed them, so thanks Tina!",
