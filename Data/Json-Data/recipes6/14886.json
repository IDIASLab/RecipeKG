I believe a teaspoon of vanilla or 1/2t of orange extract would really bring out the flavor in this wonderfully textured bread.",

The whole family loved it! I substituted 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour for 1 1/4 cups of the all purpose flour, cut down the coconut to only 1 cup (many people said 1 1/2 cups was way too much) and left out the cherries and it tasted great. I made sure to use my food processor to basically MINCE the carrot, coconut, walnuts and raisins because I knew if I left them as instructed (shredded/chopped) my toddler would refuse to eat it with so many conflicting textures.  It was a great call - seemed to meld the flavors even better and he gobbled it up. I HIGHLY recommend this bread to any Mom trying to be \"deceptively delicious\" and sneak veggies into their kids diet:)",

Like others, I omitted the cherries, just because this is carrot bread, not fruit bread and the addition of coconut, raisins, and walnuts was sufficient.  I was also skeptical on overfilling the pan - it just seemed like a lot so I cut back and filled 2/3 pan and baked for 50 mins and really, I should have just put it all in one pan (well, two since I made a double batch).  I agree with topping it with cream cheese frosting.  Hope this helps!",
