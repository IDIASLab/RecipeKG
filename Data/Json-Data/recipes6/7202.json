Though it does include RO*TEL&reg; and a can of mild green chile peppers, it's not spicy, but if you like the heat, choose hot RO*TEL&reg; and peppers. This pantry chicken casserole reheats well, too, but I had to hide it, or there would have been no night #2! A crusty bread and a green salad complete this easy pantry meal.",

You are taking a recipe's rating down when you  never even tried it.  I wish AllRecipes would just remove your review as it BS.  I made it and made some substitutions and additions and it was great.  Everyone loved it.  I used shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta, added green onions and used fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I did not have any chile peppers (did not want to go to the store just for that, don a mask and gloves and all that...) so I chopped up some pepperoncinis instead.  And I have minced garlic in a jar - and am not sure what the measurement is for a clove of garlic, so I put 3 heaping teaspoons of the minced garlic in it...and it was wonderful.  I also used a turkey breast we got from Costco, pre-cooked and ready to go.  I had put it in my crock pot with some chicken gravy for about 6 hours just to further tenderize it, and it was to die for.",
