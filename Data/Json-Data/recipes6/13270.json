I had a couple of bags of frozen blueberries that had migrated to the rear of my freezer; I hesitate to say how long they had been in there.  But after chipping them out of their frosty prison, and rinsing the ice crystals off them, they worked just fine.  I sprinkled some cinnamon over the blueberries, and I used reduced fat sour cream and added some vanilla to the filling.  Also, I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  This pie came out beautiful and delicious.  I imagine it would be even better with fresh blueberries.  Thanks for the recipe!",

My suggestion for those trying this recipe for the first time- easy on the sugar.It will overpower the taste of te pie. Instead use a little more sour cream(I used light sour cream for nutritional purposes) in the wet mixture. For the dry topping mixture I added a few dashes of cinnamon,2 tbs more of butter and didnt use all of the mixture.It made all the difference. Make sure you bake the pie about 10 minutes longer then the recipe calls for so the crust turns golden brown and the pie stays together when cutting it later.There are 6 people in my family and most of them picky eaters-this pie satisfied everyones taste and I am definately making this again.",

I used 24 oz partially thawed, undrained (oops) frozen blueberries. The second I spooned the egg/sour cream mixture over the berries they finished melting and I ended up having to scoop some out and not use all of the filling (no biggee). I also didn't use all of the topping, this recipe makes a lot. I followed the advice of previous reviewers made the following changes: used 3/4 cup white sugar, 2/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon in the filling; in the topping I used half white and half brown sugars (for total of 1/2 cup), and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. The results were wonderful (allowing for the non-draining mistake). I did have to cook longer than called for (about 20 minutes more). The pie holds together well when cut (after cooling a couple of hours, of course). Not too sweet, not sour creamy at all... Beware this goes fast so you might want to bake up 2 of them!!!!!",

I am in total agreement with the user who said the sugar needed to be reduced to 3/4C sugar (i like sweet and this was PLENTY) add 1t vanilla and up the sour cream to 2/3C. Don't worry you won't taste the sour cream!! I also had to add 10 min to the baking time (just whenever my pie crust was nice and golden). For the topping: I did 1/4C sugar and 1/4C brown sugar and I CANNOT imagine using all of it. I used enough to cover the top nicely. I also used more like 3T of COLD butter cut in instead of the 4T (1/4C on a stick of butter).",

I ate the whole pie by myself in 2 days! It's easy to make, fast, and delicious. I did follow these recommendations for the filling: 3/4 cup sugar, 2/3 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and zest of one lemon to the sour cream. For the topping: 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon. I didn't use all the topping because I didn't want the pie to be too sweet; just enough so that it covered the pie (about half of the topping). I also had to cook the pie for a lot longer; just cook until the topping is golden brown and crispy. I  prefer the pie chilled, straight from the refrigerator. Enjoy!",

Several times while trying to make this recipe a little more heart-friendly I used light sour cream light brown sugar as well as soft baking butter with canola oil. Turned out very good indeed! I highly recommend this recipe as this pie is very easy to make and even seasoned and experienced pie connoisseurs will love it!",
