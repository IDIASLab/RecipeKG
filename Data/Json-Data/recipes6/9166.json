I used Nasoya extra firm tofu cubes, which I drained in a towel inside a colander for about 2 hours to make sure that the tofu was dry before frying.  I had some shallots that I substituted for the onion and used extra garlic.  Then I added the curry powder (3 tsp.) and 1 1/2 heaping tsp. of green curry paste and let it cook for about a minute on the stove before adding the coconut milk and stirring before adding the tofu, one head of cauliflower cut into florets, and a package of cut butternut squash from the produce section.  Lastly, I added 2 pieces of lemongrass that I bruised first and then cut into about 4 inch sections.  I put the cover on it and let it cook until the squash and cauliflower were cooked, but not mushy and then added the cilantro -- an entire bunch of cilantro chopped.  Served over white rice and my house smelled super fantastic.  Definitely a keeper and I will make it again.",

It was nice and flavorful but my ultimate verdict is that it was a little too creamy for my taste I'm not too big on creamy flavor maybe I will add in water next time I make it.
