The sugar made the tomato flavor so lovely. The only things I had to omit were the veggie bouillon parsely and I omitted the salt b/c it was plenty salty. For the Italian seasoning I used 1/2 a ts each of oregano and basil. Other than that I followed the whole thing perfectly. Made 6 hearty servings that don't need accompaniment. Just b/c it's tradition I plopped a little plain yogurt on top...unnecessary. I ate it with bread and a little cheese...also unneccessary.",

The only thing I changed was I only had one 15 oz can of tomato sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes and about a TBSP of tomato paste (to thicken it a bit). I also let it simmer on the stove for about 2 hours and I didn't add pasta. It would be wonderful with pasta but I left it out for simplicity. Will definitely make this again!",

I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes w/ basil and garlic and added one (tomato can) of V-8 Vegetable juice and only 4 cups of water (like mine a little thicker). I didn't have any Italian Seasonings added 1/4 t. basil and 1/4 t. oregano and 1 t. Mrs. Dash's Original Seasonings. Also added barely 1/8 t. nutmeg. All the other seasonings-vegetables were as stated. 10 minutes before adding pasta I added 1 handful of fresh spinach. On serving added 1 T. grated parmasan cheese on top of soup. With homemade French Bread from this site... this is absolutely wonderful!!! Great comfort food on a cold winter day. Thank you for sharing your recipe. This is definitely a keeper and will make this often. Oh and this freezes beautifully.",
