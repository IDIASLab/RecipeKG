I topped half of the sauce with pecan and left out the other half without pecans. At the family dinner I got mixed reviews. Some could NOT stop eating it and kept going back for more. Others thought the cake was not rich enough or was lacking flavour. They said it just doesn't satisfy the sweet craving. I only tasted it a whole week later (stored in the fridge) after warming each slice a bit in the microwave. I loved it! I thought it just hits the spot! It was still moist and delicious! So here you go some were addicted to it and for some it was too light. You be the judge!",
