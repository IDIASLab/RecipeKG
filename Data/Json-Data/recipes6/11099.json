The 2nd time we kept an eye on it and took it out at about the minute point and it was perfect.",

I aslo use cane sugar so I had a hard time making the egg white topping as it should have come out. I added food coloring (light pink) for an Easter pastel color and the kids loved it. My husband has already started a list of combinations to try in the future -chocoalte ice cream with mint extract or orange extract etc. Thanks for a nice fun and easy recipe.",

Graham cracker crumbs and vanilla ice cream topped with almond-flavored meringue just didn't do it for us. A genuine Baked Alaska is made with cake as a base not crumbs and it's baked in the oven not merely broiled (meaning heat source only applied to the top.) We didn't care for the meringue with its heavy almond flavoring. A more suitable meringue for this dish uses brown sugar for appealing color and full flavor and a dash of vanilla. Although quicker and easier to put together we felt it was a poor substitute for real Baked Alaska and it only served to make us long for the real deal.",
