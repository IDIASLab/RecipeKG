                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: Being Asian, cooking rice is a skill I guess you're born with because I totally don't see why ANYONE had issues with burning the rice, it being uncooked, soggy, or whatever.  I cook rice the same way each time, and it comes out perfect. In saucepan, combine rice, coconut milk, water, sugar & salt. Basically the liquids should reach the area RIGHT BEFORE your cuticle (middle of the white semi-circle on your finger nail but not reaching your cuticle).  This is also assuming you've got the rice in the pot leveled, and the tip of your index finger is touching the top of the rice NOT the bottom of the pan.  This is at least how I was raised to always know how much water to put in rice for it to always come out right. Bring to boil then simmer covered for 20 min. You cook until rice is tender.  After 20 minutes, if there is still liquid or a bit soggy, I turn up the heat a tad, cover, and cook until absorbed and fluffy.  It's not rocket science! Always works!  Nothing difficult! Then mix in almonds accents (found in salad section, basically a bag of seasoned almonds to top salads) which adds the right amount of flavor to accompany the coconut taste.  BTW, my husband was not a big fan of this.  I was, but I LOVE rice and the coconut flavor.  We ate it with some japanese wings.",

I think it smelled so good while it was cooking (honestly, it smelled like I was baking coconut cookies) that the mild, subtle flavor was almost a let-down. HOWEVER, as stated in some of the other reviews, this is supposed to be a dish that compliments other Asian cuisine, and in that respect it is a 5-star recipe.  Serve this with something spicy (I made it with Easy Chicken Satay and Baked Pork - minus the pork - Spring Rolls from this site) and it is perfection!  My guests raved about the rice and I ended up appreciating it more when accompanied by something spicy.   I used light coconut milk, and almost made a big mistake by bringing to a boil over HIGH heat (started to burn!) instead of medium heat, but caught it just in time.  My rice cooked in about 10 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.",

It must just be that our taste buds are unfamiliar with this combination of flavors that made this unappealing for us...purely a subjective thing.  I do think, however, that even in a general sense this would be much improved without the sugar.  As a rescue for the leftovers, a coconut rice pudding would have been fantastic. Unfortunately, hubs is not a fan of rice pudding, so the remaining rice went down the disposal. I did appreciate introducing something different to our palates, so no regrets in trying it.",
