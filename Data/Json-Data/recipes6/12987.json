You will RUIN this cookie if you make it ANY smaller than the recipe dictates. I roll the dough into balls about the size of golf balls. This makes for a very light and beautiful cookie but the center is still moist and slightly chewy. If you are looking for a trendy designer questionably textured PB cookie recipe do not bother with this recipe. If you are looking for a big thick old fashioned perfectly textured cookie that will have your husband and co-workers eyes lighting up when they see them for the first time...go right ahead and ENJOY the compliments! Adam THANK YOU so much! This is forver my PB cookie recipe!",

The recipe is kind of expensive to make because you have to buy a box mix as well but the results are fabulous. The mix I bought did not have a separate package of peanut butter in it (as referenced in the recipe) so I simply added 1/4C more peanut butter next time I might even try 1/2C). The cookies turn out beatifully. I rolled the cookies into 1 1/2\" balls and then pressed them with a fork. I was able to get 9 cookies per sheet and the recipe made approximately 5 dozen. This recipe won't dissapoint you.",
