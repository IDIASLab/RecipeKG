Definitely whip your egg whites to stiff peaks. Recipe lacks the instruction of when to add the vanilla but be sure to add it. The description indicated there would be flecks of chocolate but since the receipe directs you to melt all the choclate I'm not sure how you obtain this. I guess you could grate some in afterwards--it might make the icing even better if that's possible. Just what I was looking for. Thank you!",

The coldness of the butter determines how long you need to mix it for. If you are ever to make italian buttercream you have to mix it for at least 10 minutes on high during which it separates and yes does look like cottage cheese. Eventually it comes together. Next time try to not have your butter so cold.",
