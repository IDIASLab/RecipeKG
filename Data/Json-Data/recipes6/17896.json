Threw in about 10 cloves of garlic instead of 6 just because. Once the marinade was done I threw the sliced peppers into the pot covered it and let it cool down. I don't like raw peppers so that way they got cooked just so that they were soft but not mushy. There was a lot of extra marinade but it serves as a good salad dressing.",
