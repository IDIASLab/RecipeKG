First switch flour and oat amounts to 1/2 c flour and 1 c oats. Second double the vanilla. Third (and this is my personal opinion) cut the choc in half and add 2/3 cup of butterscotch chips. And finally add a 1/4 tsp salt. It's sort of like a cookie in a pie shell. It will need to cool completely before serving to set. If you want it warm with ice cream you will need to reheat it after slicing it. Happy baking!",

                "reviewBody": "I revised the recipe - because as it is you very well may not be successful. I changed the flour to 1/2 cup down from 1 cup. Decrease the white sugar by half down to 1/3 cup and add 2/3 cup of brown sugar. Increases flavor and gooeyness. Increased butter by 1/4 cup up to a 3/4 cup. Keeps the pie moist. 1/4 tsp. of vanilla is absurd I put in 1 Tablespoon. To keep the oatmeal as a texture increased the oats to 3/4 cup of long cooking rolled oats (up 1/4 cup from recipe). If using quick oats leave it at 1/2 cup (slime factor). Since I was rewriting the whole recipe I used an entire cup (up 1/3 cup) of chocolate chips. I baked it at 325 for 45 minutes where it was still a bit wet in the middle but the edges were firm and browning. 25 minutes is just a sloppy raw egg filled mess. You want to cook it long enough to get mostly done but not hard like a crispy cookie. Chilling firms the filling to be similar to a firm pecan pie. Then I cooled it for cutting purposes and it held its shape tasted great and had some fiber in it. I used white whole wheat flour - so it had both oat and wheat whole grain along with that yummy chocolate chip oatmeal cookie flavor. It was a smash hit with my family of 8.",
