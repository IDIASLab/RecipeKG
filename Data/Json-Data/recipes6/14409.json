One one hand this pie really did taste like a gooey cookie but on the other hand if I wanted that i'd be better off just making cookies. Although the flavor was good the pie crust seemed to clash with the cookie flavor. Also it doesn't look that good for those of you that care about apperance.",

The walnuts were a great effect definitely will stay in my repertoire.",
