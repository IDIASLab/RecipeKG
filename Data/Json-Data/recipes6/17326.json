There is a lot of sauce which makes it seem almost like a pudding. Excellent dessert. Next time I think I'll cut back a little on the brown sugar. Over all delicious. Everybody loved it!",

To call it a pineapple cake is to raise the taste expectations to a level it can't meet. Though bland and sweet this dense moist cake is the perfect base for a coffee cake. All it needs is some zest. The next time I bake it I'll add cinnamon cloves ginger and a pinch of salt. I'll top it with a crumb blend of brown sugar cinnamon flour and butter. I think it will turn out 4-star tasty as well as 5-star easy.",
