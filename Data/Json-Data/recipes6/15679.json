I followed it exactly just used the colored marshmallows for Easter.  Next time I'll only make 1/2 a recipe b/c that little bag of pasta is deceiving!  It has a nice cool, light, fruity taste -perfect for a hot summer's day dessert.  It looks a little different but if you convince people to try it, most love it!  Make sure and serve it well chilled.  Thanks for reminding me how good this is!!",

The next time we were invited back they requested that we bring this salad. It may have even been the reason we were invited;)! Each time I made it I was not able to refrigerate for 8 hours for one reason or another. Both times I put the bowl in the freezer the morning of and stirred every 15 minutes until it was chilled through and not quite freezing to the side of the bowl. Then I refrigerated and added the rest of the ingredients right before we left for the bbq.",

To make it thick and to stick I used fresh OJ and heated it with cornstarch and water to make it thick. Recipes are a guidline and u can cahnge them often to your liking I do it all the time. Use a sugar subsitiute or just dont add it - its not that hard really. Only add things you like. I made this for St Patricks day and I colored it green (the whip cream is what I colored).",
