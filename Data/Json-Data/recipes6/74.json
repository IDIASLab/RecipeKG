I baked this cake in a glass 9x13 baking pan--my cake was done at 32 minutes. This is one of the BEST cakes I've ever made. The texture of this cake is almost like a lighter version of a pound cake. My husband said this reminds him of Snickerdoodles. Absolutely DELICIOUS. This recipe's a keeper.",

I served this as an after dinner dessert, but it could easily work with breakfast as well. Very simple recipe that I will make over and over again.",

The other family enjoyed this as much as my family did.  The recipe calls for a (18.25 oz.) boxed cake mix.  The boxes now days are (16.5 oz.) so I added 1/3 cup white flour to the mix to make up the difference.  It did not alter the taste of the cake, but made up the difference in the (1.75 oz.) that are now missing from store bought cake mixes. I\u2019ve tried this method with other cakes and have always had good luck in doing so.  Thanks Michelle for sharing your cake recipe, it is a keeper.",

I did not have high hopes since it was the butter recipe kind of mix and i only had fat free sour cream. Also it just doens't look like a very exciting cake. I tried a piece shortly after I poured the icing on- it was not very good at all so I put it in the fridge thinking it might be better cold. A few hours later I tried a small piece and could not stop! Hubs even LOVED it and he is usually a strict peanut butter/chocolate dessert lover. Took some to my parents and they also loved it. Even my 6 year old said \"oh my this cake is delicious!\" Will definitley make again- maybe with a bit extra cinnamon and I might bake at 325 since I use a non-stick pan. Awesome. You won't be sorry for trying this- except for when your pants don't fit anymore from eating it all!",
