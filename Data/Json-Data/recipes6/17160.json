I'm a very impatient baker and I never can wait for dough to harden in the fridge, so I cut them out immediately by rolling the dough between two sheets of wax paper and then dipping the cutter into sugar before cutting.  It worked very easily.  Definitely a recipe I will use often.  Oh, and by the way, make sure to space the cookies far enough apart.  These babies really puff up--but keep their shape beautifully.",

I rolled them fairly thick and was careful not to overbake them and I think that helped. I also substituted grated orange rind for nutmeg because I'm generally not a huge nutmeg fan. I iced them with cream cheese icing and they were a huge hit! Thanks Eileen. P.S. I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine becaue I was out of butter and I think that may have helped them hold their shape. Just a thought.",

Either the cookies baked hard and flat or too crumbly/grainy in texture and all of them were totally flavorless - like cardboard. This recipe has flavor the texture is perfect and it really puffs up when you bake it. I took everyone's advice and decreased the nutmeg to about 1/8 of a teaspoon plus a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I paired it with the Sugar Cookie Icing by Janice Brubaker and it was a smash hit. 10 out of 10. I've found my sugar cookie recipe for life!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent sugar cookie recipe that I have been using over a year.  I figured it was time to write my own review after reading some of the recent surprising negative reviews.  My kids always request this cookie for their holiday party snacks at school.  There is definitely not too much flour in this recipe.  If you were to use any less you would be left with a gooey mess that wouldn't be able to be rolled out.  I have made this recipe so many times and never once did I have a batch where the dough turned out crumbly.  The directions say to use softened butter and I place the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds to basically have it melted before starting on the recipe (maybe others don't have their butter softened enough to begin with).  Next, I add all the ingredients but the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and nutmeg and cream them.  Then I add half the flour (2 cups) and mix again.  After that is well blended I add the remaining 2 cups of flour with the other dry ingredients and mix.  Personally, I like the nutmeg in these cookies and don't find it to be too much at all and find it hardly noticeable.  Also, I saw someone mention these don't brown up on top.  I have never wanted my sugar cookies to brown up on top and have been known to take them out a little early to make sure they don't.  I use the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this site by JBS Box and it works excellently with these cookies.  I highly recommend this recipe!",

I made the dough a day ahead of time and refrigerated it in 2 \"logs\" wrapped in waxed paper. The chilling was necessary as even while working with it cold it got a bit sticky. I rolled each log out on my silicone baking sheet and cut cookies out directly on it peeled off the uncut portion as the cut outs remained...this allowed me to not have to \"move\" each cut out to a baking sheet which would have been tough as the dough was soft/sticky (as mentioned above). They turned out delicious...and stayed soft. In general I detest making cut-outs as I find them ot be WAY too much work but after tasting this recipe it was worth the extra effort.",
