I only did two things differently: first I used raspberry extract instead of the vanilla extract and second I added 2/3 cup Hershey's chocolate sauce ((for added chocolaty flavor)). Next time I will use Priscilla Weaver's Hot Fudge Sauce instead of the hershey's. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Hot-Fudge-Sauce/Detail.aspx This does make a HUGE batch though, so if making it for a family of four I would suggest cutting the recipe in half. Thanks so much Amy!! These are our new favorite brownies!!! ((I will never buy store bought again!))",

They are very deep over 1 1/2\" thick. These are very tasty although not as fudgy as I would expect. I just had one warm from the oven the family will give me more info later. I have chickens and many eggs so the idea of a recipe that uses 8 eggs is a good thing to me. Cutting the recipe in half would make nice deep dish brownies in a \"brownie pan\" (11x9). I will make these again!",
