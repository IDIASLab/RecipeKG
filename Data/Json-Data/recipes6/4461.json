I've had this probably 200 times and I still make it here in the US. I don't even use vegetable broth, water is fine. It's also good to add a sweet starchy vegetable like sweet potatoes or butternut squash. But the biggest difference between the African version and this recipe is how it's served. I was surprised to see this being served as a soup. It's very, very rich! In Africa, they typically pour two ladels or so over a plate of rice. And if you're serving it over rice, 2-3 lbs of chicken or beef turn it into a very hearty meal.",

First I add some carrots and celery to increase the veggie content and only use about 3/4 - 1 cup peanut butter which is plenty. If you find this is not thick enough I sometimes make a cornstarch slurry to give it the same consistency as the original. I also use fire-roasted tomatoes in this as it adds a particular rustic flavor to it. Either way this soup is requested all the time at my work parties!",

One review suggested using water instead of broth so I used less broth -- needed more flavor maybe cinnamon? Next time I will use the full amount of broth.",

I recommend using a natural peanut butter: which is just peanuts and salt. It tastes (and looks) like a spicy savory peanut sauce not unlike what you would find in a Chinese restaurant with duck.

Would recommend take some hot soup out and mixing it with the peanut butter as a paste or you will end up chasing spoons of it around the pan tying to get it to blend! Already made it again.",
