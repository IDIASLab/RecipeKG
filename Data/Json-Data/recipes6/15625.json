I expected something more like a pie, which this is not.  However, my review is based on the actual product, not my expectations.  I thought the taste of the lemon was excellent--nice and tart.  Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find the crust to be crumbly.  I think the secret is cutting the butter in well and pressing the crumbs down firmly to form the crust.  I thought the crust was a little too sweet.  Personally, I don't think the lemon layer is thick enough in relation to the crust, and if I made this again I might double the filling amount.",

My only complaint would be that it was not clear how much filling there would be. I completely covered the pie pan(which is about 2\" deep and 9\" across) with the crust. When I put the filling in it only reached halfway. So for further reference to others, the crust will only need to  cover half to two-thirds of the pie pan. Other than that, this is a truly delicious recipe!",
