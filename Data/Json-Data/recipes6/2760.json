I used to love jerky when I was a kid but I ate so much jerky that I got sick on it years ago and quit eating beef jerky all together.  My granddaughter is the jerky fan in the house so we made the beef jerky together.  Instead of garlic powder we used minced garlic and then when we got the beef on the trays of the dehydrator we sprinkled a few finely chopped green onion tops and some red pepper flakes.  \n\nAlso the recipe didn't say to but I read from USDA that to make sure the jerky was safe to eat without being refrigerated to put it in a 300F oven for 10 minutes to kill any bacteria before  putting the meat in the dehydrator.  This shortened the time in the dehydrator to 3 hours.  I am not a fan of beef jerky but it smelled so good I had to try it and it has a really good flavor.  My granddaughter loves it so we will be making this again.",
