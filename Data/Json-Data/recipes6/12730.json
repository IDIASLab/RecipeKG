I tend to add a little more oats as I do like a stiffer cookie.  I am not sure why others have tried this and they came out too runny.  Maybe the type of oats or maybe not cooking long enough before adding in the oats.  I use the old fashioned oats.  With using more oats they stiffen up much better.  They don't last long so you may want to double the recipe.  I have also made them with Pistachio pudding and they were great!  Next time I will try the Jell-O Cheesecake or Butterscotch flavor.  Thanks for this great and unique recipe.  A must try!",

A GREAT variation we loved was using lemon pudding 3 1/2 cups oats 1/2 cup craisins - soooo goood!! We also added mint chips to the chocolate ones. The butterscotch didn't even make it into a container - gone too fast. THANK YOU!! 2011: These cookies have become a regular in our household. The kind of oatmeal you use makes a big difference! The quick oats gives you a softer chewier cookie for longer. The old fashioned oats sets up much quicker (don't let it sit for 5 min) and gives you a firmer cookie. We still love Love LOVE these cookies!",
