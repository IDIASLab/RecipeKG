It turned out light moist and even better than some of the best fruit cakes I've tried. At first I was worried when I saw there were no eggs nor baking powder in the recipe and was wondering how the cake could possibly rise but it turned out just fine. My husband and kids loved it. I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup the next time I bake it only because we like cakes less sweet...but this recipe on its own is really PERFECT! Absolutely for keeps!",

For the frosting melt 1/4 c butter in a saucepan on med-low heat. Stir in 1/2 c packed brown sugar and bring to a good boil. Add 2T milk and return to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 c powdered sugar sifted. Whisk till smooth and pour over the top of the cake. This will set up nicely yet still be soft.",
