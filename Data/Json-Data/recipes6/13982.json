The cookies are quite attractive if you roll the edges in the cinnamon sugar, but for a less attractive, spicier cookie, dip the top in the cinnamon sugar too. \r\n\r\nDon't overestimate the 2\" diameter it says to roll the dough out to.

I followed the recipe exactly except I just transferred the soft cookie dough to plastic wrap (in one clump) and refrigerated until it was firm enough to work with. I used a medium cookie scoop rolled into balls and swirled each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture (which I feel in this recipe is way too much - half the amount will do just fine.). I baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes (until golden brown). After a night in a closed container the cookies were super-soft. YUM! I have already made these 5 times since I read this recipe. This is FAR better than the sometimes bland snickerdoodle. Give it a try fellow all-recipe'rs! You won't be disappointed.:-)",
