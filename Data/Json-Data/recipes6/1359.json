I thought it had a nice light wheat bread flavor but it did need more flour. I ended up using about 7 cups total of flour (3 wheat 4 AP) and had to add back in about 1/2 c of water so I would try next time with 6 1/2 c of flour. The flour to water ratio is off; if you tried as written you'd end up with a soupy bread. Reading the recipe though reminds me when my mother gave me her pizza dough recipe. She was a bit more off though telling me to add flour as needed without even giving me measurements. On the bright side those are recipes for people who like to keep adding flour until they get the right consistency. Inexperienced bread makers might like a little more guidance but that's why they have reviews on here.;) Thanks for the recipe!",

Let me know how you like it!:D Kooldog: when I make this recipe i usually make the dough pretty loose and then knead more flour into it. Probably should have added that into the instructions. But if you make a bed of flour pour the dough on top and then put more flour on top of the dough and knead adding more as needed it works better. Thanks!",

I opted for 3 loaves since I had upped the amounts I sprayed pam and floured the pans (1 metal 2 glass).
