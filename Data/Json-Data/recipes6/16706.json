Yes, the recipe neglects to tell you to add the vanilla extract, but come on folks!  Add it with/after the eggs.  I did double the vanilla, added around 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract, and added 1/4 cup of sugar as suggested by others because I like a sweeter cookie.  Perfect flavor!  Matched great with the \"Sugar Cookie Icing\" recipe on this site (not the icing recipe given).  You don't need to add flour; stick in the fridge for an hour, put flour on your rolling surface, a bit on your rolling pin, and a sprinkle on the dough you're going to roll out - no sticking!  I baked them for a total of 10 minutes, turning the sheet around in the oven at 5 minutes because my oven doesn't heat evenly on both sides unless I do so.  In my case, I had to watch the bottoms carefully - a teeny bit of golden color and they were DONE.  People are always so impressed with these!  I hate reading the extremely low star reviews for this recipe...people, learn the basics of cookie making (cream your butter/sugar thoroughly, don't over-mix the flour, use fresh baking powder/soda, learn the signs of doneness, etc.) before you complain about a recipe!",

I thought what the heck -- I like to bake and it would really not be that big of a deal if we didn't like them.  I cut the recipe in half and ended up with 28 thick, soft cookies.  I added a little almond to the dough, as others had done, just to give it a little flavor.  I'm not sure what those who didn't like them are looking for.  They were very easy to make, and the dough was easy to handle.  The final cookie is a little shortbread-like.  We really liked them and will make them again!",

I made hearts for Valentine's Day and I put them unfrosted in the freezer. I will take them out and thaw them when I am ready to frost them. Yummy cookies!

I copied the colors and piping from the Cookies by Design website and they came out PERFECT!!! Now everyone in the family calls me Martha Stewart :).

I used 2 tsp. mexican vanilla and 2 tsp. almond extract. I needed to cook them about 11 minutes or they were still doughy inside. They also spread a bit more than I thought they would so leave room between them when baking. They tasted GREAT! Not too sweet and with icing they were perfect. No sugar coma here. The dough was wonderful to work with. I used a floured pastry cloth to roll it out on and a rolling pin cover. I didn't have any problem with it sticking. I usually don't make roll out cookies because I haven't found a good dough that doesn't stick. This was the exception. I'll make these again. Hubby and kids loved them!!",
