I also used one cup of oil as suggested by other reviews and because I substituted honey I removed about 1/2 cup of liquid from the well-combined banana oil and honey mixture. With these changes the batch still turned out pretty delicious! Thanks for a great recipe for those who can't usually have tasty baked goods.:)",
