I've been marinating and seasoning pork and it's always turned out really good, but this takes boneless country ribs to a whole other level. I combine the brined pork with a carnitas recipe I've been making for awhile and it turns it into some of the best pork I've had in my life. It's a simple brine but I don't have to salt the pork while cooking anymore. I've made it in several times and in different variations. One I added liquid smoke, one a touch of soy sauce, one with added onion powder, and one with all the above with powdered thyme. The original is perfect though. Thank you for sharing this.",
