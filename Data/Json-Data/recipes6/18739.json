It may have a hardening effect on them and will prevent softening. Or you can boil beans for 10 min. reduce heat, cover, and allow to simmer 1 1/2 hrs. or until beans are tender.\" I did this and they turned out being a good consistency when they came out of the crock .",

I mashed them up added a little salt some shredded cheese and watched everyone gobble them up!!!",

I had 2 bags of beans that had been forgotten in the pantry for a long time. I tried cooking them in a crock pot after soaking overnight but they never softened. After 18 hours in the crock pot I gave up and threw them out. I usually use salt pork instead of bacon when cooking my beans. I freeze bacon drippings in 1 tablespoon batches all the time and if I don't have salt pork or bacon I use the frozen bacon drippings for seasoning. I also add Cumin when cooking my beans. I have read that you should wait until the last minute to add salt because if you add salt early in the cooking process the skins of the beans can be tough.:-)",
