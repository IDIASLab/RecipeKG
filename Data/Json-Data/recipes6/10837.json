I can't wait to make this with a cream cheese frosting. Or maybe caramel and pecan topping. The possibilities are endless. With the cake not being too sugary it allows to play with different toppings that may be heavy on sweetness. The prep time was quick and it's kid friendly too. I think a little cinnamon in the batter would give it a little zing! Thanks for the recipe!",

As written I found the frosting recipe yields a grainy texture not to mention the peanut butter taste was a bit intense. It just wasn't creamy enough for me and I didn't want to put the entire cake back in the oven to broil so instead I followed the recipe up until the last step then added 1/2 package cream cheese. Creamed this together then frosted the cake (obviously omitting the broiler). It was delicious this way.",
