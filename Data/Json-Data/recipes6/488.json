The cake part had a nice and perfectly seasoned flavor. The only change I made was using 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice for the allspice. The texture of the cake was a just a tad rubbery and both crispy on the bottom and sides. the center pieces were good. The sugar topping was kind of odd to me though. It melts into the cake and is gooey really sweet and the color somewhat of chocolate. I think I would have preferred this with a crumb topping for appearance sake and it would probably be a little less sweet too.",
