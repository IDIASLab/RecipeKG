Simply double the quantity of each item. It's that easy! I derived the potato soup with cream cheese base compliments of Panera Bread&reg;. I added a few extras over time to appeal to the whole family. This a well balanced, full-flavored soup, with a hint of trailing heat compliments of cayenne. If you have picky \"little\" ones you can substitute red pepper flakes as a side garnishment. Serve with sharp shredded cheese and a loaf a fresh beer bread!",
