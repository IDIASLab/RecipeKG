I only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and increased the sour cream to 1 cup to cut the sodium. I also sprinkled some crumbled bacon on top near the end, and next time I think I'll mix it into the casserole because it definitely added some great smoky flavor. This is a great \"make ahead\" meal to prep on the weekend and bake for dinner during the week. It would also freeze well and makes a great dish to take to a gathering or to a friend.",
