I think 15 minutes on \"low\" is not nearly enough to thicken up the topping as it was still very liquid for me. So when I put it on the cake a lot of liquid was absorbed and probably made the cake even moister than it already was. If I make this again I'll make sure the topping is much thicker before I put it on the cake.",

I'll make it again but will not start the topping until the cake is done and not put it on until it has had time to cool a bit. Also the topping did take longer that 15 minutes.",

My grandma commented that the cake made her think of being in Hawaii.:) I made just a couple of changes: I used lemon cake mix and I baked it in two 9-inch round pans and put some of the frosting both on top of the cake and between the two layers. I refrigerated the cake overnight and right before the party I covered the whole cake in whipped cream which made it look pretty and tasted great with the tropical flavors. Simple recipe that's unique enough to get rave reviews. Thanks so much!",
