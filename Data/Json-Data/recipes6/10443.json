The kids and I liked it but it wasn't our favorite quick bread recipe. I got 12 muffins out of this recipe. 350* for just about 20 minutes and they were ready to go. Next time, I'll add some spices.",

Definitely double the amount of raisins and even add a few chopped dried apricots or walnuts. I would also advise adding cinnamon to make it more New Zealand I'm from Christchurch and every time I have eaten this bread it has cinnamon to make it a browney color. It doesn't need an hour I had mine in for around 45-50 minutes and it was almost a little burnt definitely keep an eye on it with the bread thermometer or use the toothpick test. Most other loaves for this bread taste sweeter so next time I would also add a little more sugar.",
