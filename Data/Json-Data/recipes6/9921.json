I made 5 huge balls of burger then seperated in halves it occured to me that I could have left them whole and stuck in my thumb and hollow out a \"pocket\" to fill then seal with less effort.

I followed this recipe almost exactly (I used less meat per burger I used 1.65 lbs for 6 burgers which were probably a little on the small side but I think you can easily get 6-8 burgers out of 2 lbs.) and I made Kraft's adult macaroni & cheese to put in the middle. I probably used less bacon because of he addition of the macaroni (I wanted left overs for an egg bake) but I just mixed the two together and they were delicious! Also I don't have a grill so I broiled the burgers which worked just fine. Thanks \"Mom\" for this amazing stuffed burger recipe!:)",
