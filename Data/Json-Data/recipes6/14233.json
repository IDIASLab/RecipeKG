The orange part had a decent flavor but the crust was NOT good. It was very gritty and didn't go with the filling. I do not think I will make it again.",

Unless I did something incredibly wrong -which doesn't seem possible because my sister and I both made this together this came out inedible. It was too sweet almost tasted like someone poored sugar all over it ruining any hope of something edible. I followed the directions and unfortunately came up with something that had to be thrown away that same night. (AND I'M EASY TO PLEASE!)",

Couple hints, the individuals who thought the orange taste was too strong....this calls for a 6oz can of concentrate, most are 12 oz, so if you're putting in the whole can, then that is why the taste is so strong. Also, I only put in about 3/4 can. of condensed milk due to the sweetness, use brown sugar in the crust, and 2 cans of 16oz. oranges.  Hopefully this will help!! Thanks again for the post!!!",
