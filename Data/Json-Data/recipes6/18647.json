I lined the pie plate with parchment paper allowing the excess to stand up on the sides. I also put a row of halved pecans around the bottom. I added a about 1/2 cup of white raisins and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to the apple mixture. After inverting the pie I allowed the pie to cool for about 20 minutes and removed the parchment paper. The wonderful pecan mixture was also on the sides like icing. It was beautiful and the pie plate was completely clean. Finished off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The family loved it. A new favorite!!! Thank you.",

Another note I'll have to remember for next time: If all you have is a deep pie dish, don't make the pie crust edge very high.  If you do, you'll get a depression in the middle of the pie when you flip it over.  If you're concerned about it bubbling over, keep the crust edges on and break them off before you flip over the pie.  I'm glad others posted the wax paper tip!!",
