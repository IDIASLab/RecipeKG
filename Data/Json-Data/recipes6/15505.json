I had some Apricot Brandy Pound Cake (this site) in the freezer, but no ice cream or frozen topping. I had been intrigued with this recipe because of the nutmeg content, so I finally made it. I didn't have freshly grated, but used dried. It still came out wonderful. This sauce is soooo yummy. I know it would be great over ice cream, cake, bavarian cream, or whatever. You can make it as lemony as you want by increasing or decreasing the lemon juice.Thanks Ginger!",
