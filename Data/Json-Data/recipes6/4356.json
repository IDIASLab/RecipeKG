I've had the arborio rice for months! Flavor was good, texture wonderful. Vegetable and herb prep took substantially longer than the 30 minutes indicated. Fresh herbs make a big difference! For my taste, next time I will make these changes: less lemon juice and zest, slightly less fennel, double the parmessan cheese. All in all a very pleasant experience. Definitely recommended.",

I fixed it with Robust Baked Garlic Chicken and it went together very well.",

I had intended on making a different one tonight but was missing an ingredient so I was glad when I found this one because I had almost everything on hand. I used red and yellow peppers just to give it more color. One thing I noticed is that the recipe doesn't tell you to heat the broth before adding it although every other risotto recipe I've used calls for this step. Also Arborio rice is better but it's expensive and sometimes hard to find. I find you can get away with using any kind of white rice. I even used Basmati rice tonight because that's all I had and it turns out just as good! I served it with lemon baked salmon and it was a big hit!",
