I was happy to realize that if you're going to follow directions and make 16 balls then they are a good size. That means less time involved in prep which makes this treat even better in my opinion. I would love to try with drizzled chocolate as suggested but I don't want to mess with the perfection that these already are! I'll be making these again this week for a special trick or treat for our close neighbour kids. Thanks Lilcat for sharing your childhood treat recipe!",
