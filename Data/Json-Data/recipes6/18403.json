Since I wanted to bring out more of that wonderful citrus flavor I used 2 Tbsp. of lemon zest and a full Tbsp. of real fresh squeezed lemon juice. As a personal preference I also cut way back on the spices using only a pinch of each. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin lined with paper liners so I got a half dozen really big muffins (no way would this yield a dozen). They took 20 minutes at 400. I poked holes on top with a toothpick while warm and poured a bit of glaze over top of each. The lemon glaze really gives these muffins a nice sheen and brings out even more of that great citrus flavor.",

Also I agree with others that I just got by with making 12 no way you can get 24 out of them. I added more zest and juice and a bit more sugar to make sure they weren't tart ( next time less sugar wasn't needed) since I made them at my preschool with 6 3-5 yr. olds. THey were easy to make and were loved.But I was suprised that no one else said that the spices over took the flavor. You really hardly could taste the lemon at all. Next time I'll try them without the 3 spices and add van. and maybe more of the lemon ingrediants. We didn't put on the glaze(frosting) I made them again at my preschool and more then doubled the lemon juice and zest. I put in the original amount of sugar and left out ginger cinn. and nutmeg. Everyone loved them including me.I did put in vanalli.",
