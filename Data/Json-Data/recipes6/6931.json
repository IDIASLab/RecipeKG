Also instead of using the full amount of seasoning I just added one can of Tomatoes with Chilis (aka Rotel - but a larger non-branded of the same) along with the can already in it. And also had some zucchini from our CSA basket so I added 2 of those right near the end. It was terrific!!! I'm putting it on my 'go to' recipe list! Easy and fast AND used some of those collards that I'm running out of ideas on! Thank you!",
