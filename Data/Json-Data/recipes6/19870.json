I then read the reviews and was really confused but I made this recipe anyway. Since I did not have any pearl tapioca on hand I used minute tapioca and let the ingredients set the required five minutes before starting to cook; I also used 1 cup uncooked minute rice which I added before baking. I omitted the raisins as my husband does not like them. As another reviewer mentions it did look curdled when I took it out of the oven; that disappeared as it cooled. After this cooled overnight and the flavors blended it was very good! When I make this again I think that I will omit the baking and just boil it per the instructions on the minute tapioca adding the uncooked rice and vanilla after it has boiled.",

Simply prepare it on your stove-top as indicated in the recipe allow it to cool for perhaps 10-15 minutes then cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for an hour or more. Delicious! Great with whipped cream or CoolWhip on top.(want it creamier? fold in 1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream just prior to refrigerating it)",
