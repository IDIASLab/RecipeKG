Definitely give it at LEAST 1 1/2 hours to rise before making waffles (if you don't you'll end up with dense, less flavorful waffles - I did that once) and overnight is really the best if you can think about breakfast that far in advance (which I can't).

With a couple of steps in the morning and you have a wonderful breakfast. I use a belgian waffle iron that flips and I wipe the hot iron with a stick of butter before each waffle. I always serve these waffles with fresh whipping cream real maple syrup and an assortment of berries. I disolve the sugar in the water before adding the yeast to help it rise. Other than this step I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe!!! If you do any research and look for an authentic Belgian recipe I think this \"yeasty\" recipe is very close in taste but is much easier than the traditional Belgian recipes. They are even better the second or third day. When I have extra batter I freeze it in individual serving bags and put them in the freeze for my son who is away at school. I haven't used the frozen batter for clients but my son loves having this taste from home while he is away.",
