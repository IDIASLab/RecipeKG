And the cookie flavor was delicious!  These don't spread much and really retain the spritzed shape...they looked really nice.  I substituted butter for the butter shortening (yuck) and added 1 t. orange extract for a little bit extra orange flavor.  I also experimented with a light orange glaze icing that I drizzled over the top of a few...YUM.  These can be dressed up or down and my kids loved playing around with different candy sprinkles.  At 12 minutes, they cooled to a crisp texture.  I think 10 minutes would be better since we really like a chewier cookie.  These can EASILY be adapted to any flavor...lemon, almond, coconut...etc.  It is the PERFECT spritz recipe!!!  :o)",

BUT.....I am still in the middle of baking them and the cookie press is just not working out for me. The dough keeps sticking and won't come out and stay on the cookie sheet. For every 10 cookies I try I get one that turns out. The only thing I did different than the recipe was to use butter instead of the butter flavored shortening. I can't believe this would make such a huge difference. I want to try these again with the butter flavored shortening. The taste is so good I hope it turns out but so far it's been a huge pain in my butt!!!....I tried these again with the butter flavored shortening and they turned out a lot better than my first time. I guess that's what it was. This makes a lot of cookies.",

It was easy as pie, and so very delicious.  The very slight hint of orange flavor from the zest is perfect.  In fact, I may use even a little more zest next time.  I had some leftover Nestle's white morsels from another project, so I melted a cup of them in the microwave with a TBS or so of shortening, then stirred in a few drops of orange extract and dipped some of the cooled cookies halfway.  Oh my goodness...they were heavenly and looked so pretty with the coating (which set up very nicely so that I could still easily stack the cookies).  Again, thank you so very much -- your fantastic recipe has certainly brightened our holidays! :)",
