I prefer to cut up 1 pound of thick sliced bacon, cut into 3/4\"-1\" pieces, and fried to \"extra crisp\".  I did not place any bacon on  top.  #3 - I increased the Bourbon to 1 cup rather than 1/2 cup.  There wasn't enough left for a good midnight snack!!  Prepared as a side dish with Pineapple Pulled Pork.  Added oven roasted potatoes and called it dinner.  Final Note:  The beans were too \"soupy\" when doubling the Dr Pepper and Bourbon, so I took off about 3 cups of liquid from the beans, set it aside, reheated at dinnertime and it became a marvelous sauce for the pulled pork.  Enjoy, I did!!!",

I followed a combination of tips from some of the other reviews that said it came out soupy when doubled and it came out perfect. Here\u2019s what I did:\nBecause we love bacon I fried up a whole pound (though my kids ate some so probably  only 0.5-0.75 actually made it into the pot). I drained the four cans of beans (remember I\u2019m doubling the recipe) in a strainer but didn\u2019t rinse. I drained most of the bacon grease off since a pound makes a lot more than the original recipe would have called for, I left enough in my cast iron Dutch oven to saut\u00e9 the garlic. I omitted the step with the onions entirely. I combined all the sauce ingredients (doubled) as directed to keep the flavor consistency except my store didn\u2019t have cans of Dr Pepper so I used one 20 oz bottle. I meant to go back and add another 4 ounces but forgot. I only added 3 cups of the sauce mixture in when I added the beans since people said it got soupy. (About half of what I made- I threw the rest of the sauce out but it would have made a nice sauce for something else if I was making a meat). Since I was on a time constraint I didn\u2019t want to worry about raw bacon on top so I omitted that and simply covered with the lid of my Dutch oven. This came out perfectly- not soupy when cooked for exactly 2 hours; I stirred twice during that time. At one hour the flavor",

They taste ok but in my opinion not eye appealing to serve to company. I would have considered more stars for ingredients & decent flavors but very frustrating to waste money & a lot of time on a dish I can\u2019t serve",
