People look at vegan and get turned off but I have found especially w/ deserts that vegan usually tasts the same as w/ dairy. The only difference between this recipe and a standard good chocolate pudding recipe is the soy creamer. Good dark chocolate does not have dairy as a rule. I used Wholefoood's dark chocolate chips in their bulk section because they are sooo good. One more thing don't put the cornstarch in the pot of boiling liquid but rather put it in before boiling and stir till dissolved. This will prevent it from clumping from the heat.",
