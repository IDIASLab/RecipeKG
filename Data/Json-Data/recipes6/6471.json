                "reviewBody": "I have made many variations of chicken wing dip and this one was probably one Id try again but with a few changes mentioned below. First it would have been just as good cooked in the oven so next time I won t use the slow cooker the goat cheese I didn t find necessary either seeing as it just tasted like what chicken wing dip normally tastes like so next time I will cut that out. I did what someone else mentioned and added a dash of lemon pepper and a dash of minced garlic which once again I didn t find much purpose in as well seeing as all the other ingredients overpowered it and you couldn t even tell it was there. I also used an entire 3 pound chicken doubled the cream cheese double the Monterey Jack cheese added maybe about a cup and a half of cheddar used almost an entire bottle of franks extra spicy buffalo wing sauce leaving about a quarter of the bottle and same with the blue cheese dressing. It was delicious and I ended up with a lot of left overs which I love. One other thing I love about chicken wing dip is no matter how you make it it always taste even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe",
