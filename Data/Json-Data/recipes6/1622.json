When I pulled it out this morning it was settled like I thought it would. I put the dough into 1 inch balls and put them in the freezer for about a half an hour. Melting the chocolate was easy but I ran into problems on the way when I dipped the dough into the chocolate some of the dough fell off into the chocolate. the first few balls turned out beautifully the others not so much but they taste delicious.",
