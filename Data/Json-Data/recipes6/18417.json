I used the recipe for the crust as it was originally printed. Instead of the original filling I used the sour cream added a 1/2 cup of sugar a 16 oz carton of marscapone and a 16 oz carton of ricotta with only one egg and a slosh or two of Amaretto no salt. In between the layers I added some granulated raw sugar and cinnamon. I baked this until I could see that both the top and the bottom crust were cooked. The filling was a bit soft still. NO PROBLEM by the time this was served it was PERFECT! Then the day after this stuff is like a cheesecake it is amazing on day two! I also served a sauce with this that was made using peach jam with some Amaretto and a bit of cranberry sauce. OOO-LA_LA! Amazing! Thanks sooo much for this recipe! I will use it for many occassions.",

I made this for dinner tonight and surprisingly with all the goofs it came out just great! Not puffy but still very good. I added vanilla and left out the salt at the recommendation of others. Served this with chunks of cantaloupe on the side and some leftover baked spiral ham - everyone loved it! I'd make it again - next time trying to follow the recipe by not leaving out ingredients just to see what it is supposed to be like. 1. I inadvertently left out the baking powder. 2. I also inadvertently left the melted (instead of soft) butter in the microwave and forgot to add it to the cheese mixture so poured it over the top of the cheese mixture instead. 3. I also didn t have enough cottage cheese only about 1 cup so added about 1/4 cup sour cream instead of just a tablespoon. 4. I also sprinkled about 3/4 cup fresh blueberries over the top of the cheese before spooning the balance of the dough mixture on top. VERY good and I think I would try peaches or sliced apples sometime too. 5. I also made a mixture of raw sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it over the top of the whole thing before baking. Also VERY good.",
