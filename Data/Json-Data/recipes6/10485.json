I ran out of sour cream, but wanted to make these so I used some plain yogurt. The only difference was that when I used the yogurt, I omitted the 2T of milk. Since yogurt is so \"moist,\" I didn't need it. I also omitted the raisins both times because we never keep 'em around the house. I also doubled the sugar, cinnamon, and salt, and used butter instead of margarine. The icing is great to top these off with, so don't leave it out. I love this recipe. The biscuits are moist and soft, they keep well for atleast 3 days, and they reheat well. I usually cook mine at 390 for about 22 minutes or so on the VERY TOP rack. MMMMMM  MMMMM. This one's a keeper!!!",

I did increase the sugar to 2T and cinnamon to 1t and added vanilla to the glaze. If you really want to \"gild the lilly\" try melting about 3 T of butter and spreading it on the bottom of your baking sheet. When placing the cut biscuits on the sheet set them in the butter and then flip them so that both sides are coated in butter. Use a pastry brush to spread any excess butter on the biscuits. This is how I make my regular biscuits and really adds that extra touch. I also sprinkled a little cin and sugar on top. Will definitely be making these again!",
