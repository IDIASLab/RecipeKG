My mother-n-law always made cornbread stuffing every Thanksgiving, and she passed away this year, I wanted to make this for my husband.  It is a lot of work but worth it.  I chopped all the vegetables, herbs, and garlic & put in a freezer bag the day before (took a full hour since I don't have a food processor) so it was a breeze the next day putting it all together.  I was hesitant to use 7 eggs, but it turned out fantastic. I did not stuff the turkey, I just baked it in a greased casserole dish on 350 for about an hour.  The flavor is incredible.  I cut up the leftover stuffing into squares and wrapped individually in sandwich bags & then put all in a freezer bag. Thanks Kevin.  This will become a regular at our house!",

I saved some time by substituting dried herbs for fresh (1 T fresh = 1 t dried).  Cooking the spices in the butter first really allows the flavor to get into every bite of the cornbread.  It was a little tricky to fish out the bay leaves after the cornbread went in.  Next time, I'll pull them out before adding the cornbread.  I made this the night before Thanksgiving, put it in a 9x13 pan, and baked in the oven for an hour or so.  It was a great twist on a classic, added a new taste to the meal, and turned out fabulously!",

Here is a tip for making it though I have several picky family members who do not even eat stuffing because it has too many chunks of things that they do not like so I minced everything. The result was fabulous! I did eliminate the cayenne pepper all together and I would recommend that if you make it this way don't add the salt at all.

The outcome is incredible. We think you will love too if you are looking to have a not so traditional stuffing that your family will enjoy.",

The cornbread itself was pretty good and the seasonings were okay. But the texture of the dressing was awful. I couldn't think of how to describe it until I read someone else's review saying it was like oatmeal. Exactly! Gummy. I like a more grainy texture. Sheesh I hate being the \"Debbie Downer.\"",
