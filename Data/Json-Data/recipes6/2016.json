The meat mixture was very loose and seemed to have too much liquid in it. I had to add some additional crackers to help bind the mixture. Once cooked although the meat wasn't bad all I could taste was tomato and peppers. There wasn't much other flavor and seemed very one note and bland. I don't plan on making this again.",
