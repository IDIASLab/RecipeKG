Rather I had to roll handfuls of it into balls which never changed shape as they baked--except the few that fell apart as they baked. The batter itself tasted good; it just needed more liquid (an egg maybe?) to keep it all together. I'm sorry I wasted my time and ingredients (heck I even MADE golden syrup for this) on this one. Don't make the same mistake...",
