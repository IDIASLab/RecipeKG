For the cream filling I use fat free cool whip and fat free or light cream cheese and only 1/4c sugar. For the topping I use a large can of pineapple chunks and just put then in the food processor first. No sugar needed in the topping and because of using large can instead of 8oz I use 3T cornstarch.",
