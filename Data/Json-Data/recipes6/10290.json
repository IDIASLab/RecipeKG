Then I mixed in the other ingredients adding the flour last. Well people the stickiness depends on the humidity level. ADD MORE FLOUR if it is too sticky! Geeez! Yummy good stuff!

Somehow, though,  I turned kind of hippy and hate the thought of all those added 'ingredients' in commercial bread. So I bought myself some organic flour and settled in with this recipe. Holy sh#t. So easy and so amazing. I don't have a bread machine,  so I did what others did: dissolved the (doubled because I NEEDED SWEET BREAD) sugar, salt and oil (because it seemed easier) in the water then let the yeast hang out in the mess and get frothy.  Added everything else (plus an extra 1/4c flour on recommendation of everyone and swapped the lemon out for extra vanilla, because I want sweet bread, dagnabbit) and let it hang out an hour.  I didn't have any issues with it exploding everywhere like other people did. Baked it 33 minutes and it is everything I ever hoped it would be, albeit a slightly crumblier version, but nothing unmanageable. The kids said it was too sweet, but I've had my suspicions about them for some time now and I'm pretty sure they're not mine. Probably not even human, if I had to guess.  It's ok, though, because now I only have to fight my husband for the rest of the loaf. I'm certain he'll underestimate me in this battle.",
