If you use a 13x9 pan, as suggested in the recipe, it will fill the entire pan and make big tall krispie treats, but if you want them a little smaller, divide it up into 2 13x9 pans.  I ended up cutting tall ones in half to serve...but either way, they are wonderful.  Thanks MrsFisher!!",

I wasn't sure if I needed to adjust amounts so added 1/2 teaspoon at a time and tasted after each addition. I ended up using the full 2 teaspoons and it was perfect. I used a 13x9 pan and also a 9x9 to get the height that I thought was good. My finished bars were a titch over an inch high. Everyone asked for the recipe on this one. They still taste like Rice Krispie bars but subtly and wonderfully different. Great recipe!!",
