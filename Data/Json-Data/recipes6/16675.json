But the applesauce diluted the intense cranberry flavor and the crust wasn't substantial enough (the bars were too flimsy). So the second time I used the following ingredients also in a 9 X 13 pan: 4 cups cranberries 1 1/3 cups white sugar 3 tablespoons orange zest 2 cups rolled oats 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup packed light-brown sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2 sticks butter I baked it for about 35 minutes at 370 degrees. The cranberry filling had the intense flavor I wanted and the crust was substantial making for a firm bar.",

Then I added 1/4 cup of apple juice with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch stirred in to thicken filling.  The end result was an awesome filling without the bite that often accompanies cranberry recipes.

I tried them and wanted to find a recipe so that I could make them at home. This recipe looked like it was the closest match so I tested it out. I added about 1/2 a cup more oatmeal, 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts, as well as some allspice, cinnamon and cloves to the dry mixture and used 1 (16 oz) can of whole berrry cranberry sauce as the middle spread instead of making the cranberry sauce myself.  They turned out amazing and almost the exact flavor of the ones we sell at the coffee shop!  One more thing, I did use a 9x9 pan put I had no extra because I make a very thick bottom layer and also worked the bottom layer up the side of the pan halfway. I saved just enough of the mixture to cover the top of the cranberry sauce.",

There are no ingredients to activate its leavening action so it does nothing. I will probably make these again but will use common sense in making the crust: less flour more butter a bit more salt and definitely no baking powder.",

The only thing I'd do differently is add a tiny bit more brown sugar to the crust next time.
