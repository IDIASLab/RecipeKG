The recipe gives no estimated time as to how long to cook the beets. 5 minutes? 20 minutes? 1 hour? This may be confusing for novice cooks. Also 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds is way too much. I used 2 teaspoons and it was perfect. Otherwise these were delicious. I added some dill and a can of mandarin oranges to the salad as recommened by other reviewers. Also I added more horseradish because 1 teaspoon didn't give it the kick I was looking for. My husband and I enjoyed this very much. Thanks.",

(wash them-just get the dirt off) cut off the greens then remove the vein with scissors. save for later...delicious. 2nd double wrap in foil bake in a 300 degree oven for 2 hours. cook slower for a longer time. You want them to develop the & draw out the sugar (Heard of sugar beets?) let them cool. remove foil and rub the skin off..put your hands in a plastic bag use an old washcloth-(you will discard this cloth). I taste them. if they need sweetness I may add brown sugar raw sugar or honey. Once you have baked your beets you will never boil them again..use the skin in your compost or worms or dig a small hole and put them in your garden. The beets at Traider Joes are as awful as December tomatoes. speaking of which when I need tomatoes for a sandwich in winter I use canned drained and blotted dry. They slice well. No one will notice if you have added crisp lettuce and some bacon...a BLT... Try the slow long cooking for sweet potatoes... but those skins go to me I just love them baked and caramelized. The worms fend for themselves. It's an acquired taste. experiment explore and have fun.",

There's so much caraway that it crunches when you eat the beets. I wonder if it's supposed to be 2 teaspoons? I'll try that next time and also cut back or eliminate the oil. I also might try adding orange sections and dill as suggested by other reviewers.",

They come pre-cooked and are found near the salad in plastic with a box around it. I used 1 1/2 packages. So much easier than cooking the beets.
