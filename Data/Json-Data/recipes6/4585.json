Fast supper technique: Put up broth to boil, (I used chicken rather than vegetable) peel the sweet potatoes, chunk them up into the broth, chunk up the onion and add to the broth. Substitution for curry paste and fresh ginger: 1 t chili powder, 1 t cumin, 1 t ginger, and 1 T curry powder. Once the potatoes were cooked, puree in the blender with the lemon juice and then pour back into pan and add the coconut milk, chopped cilantro & sesame oil. I skipped the salt. VERY tasty and quick! Garnished with a seasoned sour cream/yogurt blend and we can hardly wait to have leftovers tomorrow night!",

The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that my boyfriend wasn't wild about the soup. \n\nI made the following changes to make the soup healthier and more authentic:\n1. Used lite coconut milk from Trader Joe's instead of regular coconut milk to cut down on the calorie and fat content\n2. I added more curry paste than the recipe called for- about 1 1/2 table spoons. I really like Thai curry flavor and I'm used to really strong Thai curries from restaurants.\n3. Substituted fish sauce for the salt in the recipe and I added it while the soup was simmering \n4. I cooked it for way longer than the original recipe calls for.  After I added the sweet potatoes I simmered the soup for about a half hour. \n5. Here's the big thing.  The soup tasted bland, but I put 3/4ths of the batch into the blender and it made the soup go from ok to great.  It made all the flavor from the sweet potatoes come out. \n6. I added the cilantro, but not the sesame oil.  The soup really didn't need the extra flavor.",
