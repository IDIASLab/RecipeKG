Butterscotch candy needs to be stirred constantly as the higher the temperature, the less water content and more concentrated the sugar becomes.  This means it can burn easily if not stirred constantly. Butterscotch needs to come up to the temperature of soft crack stage (see below)just as the submitter wrote.\r\n. Soft-Crack Stage\r\n270\u00b0 F\u2013290\u00b0 F\r\nsugar concentration: 95%\r\nAs the syrup reached soft-crack stage, the bubbles on top will become smaller, thicker, and closer together. At this stage, the moisture content is low. When you drop a bit of this syrup into cold water, it will solidify into threads that, when removed from the water, are flexible, not brittle. They will bend slightly before breaking.\r\n\r\nSaltwater taffy and butterscotch are cooked to the soft-crack stage. \r\n\r\nBy following this recipe exactly and stirring constantly, it will be awesome!",
