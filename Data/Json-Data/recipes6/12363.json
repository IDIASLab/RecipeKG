I refrigerated the dough as suggested by someone else and they turned out perfectly. I also made half with regular hershey kisses and the other half with caramel hershey kiss. I also put some chocoloate chips in a plastic ziploc bag and placed it in a pot of boiling water for a minute or two. I then cut a small corner and used the chocolate to drizzle over the cookies. Just make sure you let the chocolate set before you put them in a container.",
