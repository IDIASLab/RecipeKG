I also used coconut buttercream icing instead.  1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening, coconut flavoring, 1 lb powdered sugar, 2 or 3 TBS milk, and 2 cups coconut.  It was so yummy.

I didn't even notice until after I put the cake in the oven that the cake mix I purchased already had pudding in it and subsequently the cake required almost 45 minutes to bake. It turned out fine though. I toasted some coconut in the oven for the topping. Will definitely make this again!",

I made one cake with the frosting recommended and toasted coconut - great.  I made another batch as pinapple upside down cupcakes and they were so good that they didn't last the evening.  I melted 1/2 tablespoon butter in bottom of cupcake tins, added some brown sugar to melted butter, put pinapple ring in bottom with cherry in center, cake batter on top.  After cooking (25-30 min) I flipped them immediately onto wax paper then placed them on a plate.  Beautiful and delicious!  Each cupcake is a great individual serving but everyone took more than just one!!!!  Enjoy!",

Used Pecans instead of the walnuts and used coconut pudding instead of the vanilla. Shredded the coconut up fine. For the frosting I used my own made up recipe as the one here would have been too sweet for my family. I bought instant coconut pudding and 8 oz of cream cheese. Mixed together and spread on cake. Put a thin layer of cool whip on top of the pudding mix and topped it off by adding toasted coconut on top. Had never toasted coconut before. So good that way. Easy-just put in oven for a few minutes. Keep an eye out as they brown up very quickly.",

While I was getting it all together I had serious doubts. 1)The coconut was really greasy so maybe I would toast the coconut in the oven and avoid all that butter. 2) While icing the cake it looked really messy and I thought at some point that it tastes very good but doesn't give a nice appearance but once I was finished making things look nice and sprinkling the coconut on top it really came together great and it tasted great as well. So I would definetly make this cake. So if while making this cake you think that your doing it wrong or that it was a bad choice stick it out and you'll see that this cake is great!",
