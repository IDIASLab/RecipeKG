I couldn't find an organic frozen veggie blend at my supermarket so I threw in some frozen peas and corn and edamame and then I sliced up some baby carrots. I also was short on potatoes (only had three small ones the equilent of just over one normal-sized potato). I didn't peel my potatoes because that's where all the nutrients are! This is the kind of recipe you can make with what's on hand and it turns out well.I added about an extra 1/8 cup of broth to my dumpling dough and after mixing with the fork I gave up and kneaded with my hands. I've never made dumplings before and don't know if that was wrong but they came out yummy. I cut the dumplings with tiny cookie cutters in star and flower shapes and the soup came out so pretty! It's nice and thick and stewy. Next time I'll cook it another hour before adding the dumplings (I cooked 4.5 hours added dumplings cooked another 1.25 hours) just because I'd like the carrots and potatoes even softer. But no complaints. My toddler is usually a good eater but has been picky lately. She seems to really like this though.",
