I did use the shortening, though I was tempted to use oil.  I don't know if it makes a difference or not, but they were good.  I was a little afraid the batter was too thin, but the final product proved me wrong.  It had the best texture of any waffles I've made and it had a good flavor. It was not super light and airy if that's what you want, nor was it super dense.  It had a nice blend of chewiness and substance.  My husband (who's very much a food critic) liked these very much also. I've tried over 10+ waffle recipes, and so far this is the winner.",

I have a Waring Professional waffle maker (the kind that you fill and turn) and this recipe made 4 giant waffles.  Plenty enough to freeze for another day.

Folding this mixture in with everything at the last minute made the batter less runny. I also used butter instead of shortening. As a result of having a very basic waffle maker it did not come out super fluffy but it did turn out great. Tender beautifully golden with wonderful aroma. It has just the right amount of egg and milk for it to be wholesome. I agree that it needs a little dusting of powdered sugar on top and goes great with fruit. In my opinion this is probably more of a dessert waffle recipe. Update: I made it several times more by now.:) With the waffle iron preheated at medium high it came out even better than before. Just a tiny bit of golden brown/nice and crispy on the outside with inside still moist and wonderful. 1/2 milk and half water probably helped on this as well. Loving it as a late night snack hehe. Thank you so much for this recipe.",

Fairly bland but again it works well with syrup. I think I'll stick to my recipe in the future. For those of you who substituted butter for the shortening you should not be rating this recipe as that completely changes it. So does coating them with powdered sugar. My rating is for this recipe made as is and as is it does not have butter flavor and is not very sweet.",
