Beautifully moist and tender while maintaining those traditional flavours where turkey tastes like turkey rather than a bird with a foreign taste which can happen with some brine recipes. The gravy is so tasty but be careful with the salt as the brine has done that for you. If you save the carcass and use it later for soups or stews the flavours are tremendous as well because when you brine it penetrates the bones right through. If you try it once it will become a must do every time you roast a turkey. Yummmmmmmy",

It is easy, inexpensive and definitely makes the turkey more moist, flavorful and delicious.  I especially love the gravy that it makes...sorta salty, but I love salty things.  I follow the recipe exactly, but sometimes I use chicken stock/broth instead of vegetable if it is what I have on-hand or is less expensive.  Also, I always double the recipe to ensure that there is enough to cover the turkey.  I use a new 5-gallon bucket to brine the turkey.  Great recipe!!",
