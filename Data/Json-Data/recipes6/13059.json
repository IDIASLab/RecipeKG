I added some vanilla to the batter and baked at 400 for almost 40 minutes to avoid burning, as recommended by others.

Bearing in mind that everyone's oven can be different, I opted for a lower temp because I can always cook it longer if necessary. I suggest that you use your best judgment when you go to bake it. I topped it with blueberry preserves and it was a great hit. I'll make this regularly!",

It seemed to me like a cross between a very firm custard and a popover.  As written, I thought there was too much butter - melted butter pooled on the top and its flavor dominated.  The second time I halved the butter (2 TBSP) and liked it much more.  The edges puffed up really high, but the middle stayed flat like a basket, so you can fill with fruit for an attractive presentation.  Maple syrup was also good, and I cut up some of the flat middle section into small squares, topped with jam, and served them like cakes.  It was good both hot and cold!",
