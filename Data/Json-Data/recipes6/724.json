Didn't taste mustardy at all. (I used a mix of spicy mustard and dijon mustard...not sure how it would taste with yellow mustard.) I added some onion powder and garlic powder, and cooked some sauce with the wings--the sauce gets super gooey--my daughter said it was the best chicken she's ever had.  This was the first time I have ever made wings from scratch, and I will be making them again!  Thanks for the recipe!  I didn't even marinate and they were still amazing!",

I then added 1tsp of melted butter (serving the purpose of a liaison), and deep fried my chicken wings in regular canola oil, then tossed the wings in the glaze. It tuned out wonderful!!!! but different than the usual oriental or buffalo flavors. You can get so creative with this versatile sauce!",
