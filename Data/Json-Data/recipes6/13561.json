                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe for a fish fry last weekend. I made two batches to experiment- one using store bought cookie dough and one using the recipe from scratch. Neither my husband nor I could tell the difference once the toppings were on, so my advice is to just buy the prepared dough! I decided to make a dozen mini personal pizzas which looked great but took a little longer to decorate (see picture I submitted). This made it easy to eat without a fork/plate. \n\nI used marshmallow cream (13oz jar) with the double batch of cheese to lighten it up. I had baked the cookies, chopped the fruit and mixed the cheese the previous night and by the time I finished decorating the mini pizzas (had about 12 with 2 batches), the cheese was very soft. We had a sample at that point and it was great. By the time we drove an hour to the party, dinner was delayed & some folks did not have dessert for 2-3 more hours later. These pizzas did get VERY soggy after the point of 5 or 6 hours. This is not a good recipe for leaving out on a buffet for an all-day BBQ. My recommendation is to make sure you have space in a fridge (which is tricky if you're a guest) and only leave them out for 2 hours maximum before serving. This is a better \"served\" dish rather than a \"grazing\" dessert. I still had lots of compliments and they still tasted great, crispy or soggy!\n\nThe fruit I used were strawberries, blueberries, kiwis, nectarines, grapes, and mandarin oranges. Excellent combination!",

After reading the reviews I was worried about the pizza becoming soggy since this would be going to the office and sitting out for a while.  I decided to make individual pizzas to make it easier to eat. I  placed small balls of dough and pressed into the bottom of cupcake holders. I baked a couple dozen at a time on cookie sheets and cooked for longer than recommended.  I baked until they were a golden brown on the edges (some were turning golden all the way thru depending on thickness) when cooled it was a cracker consistency.  Cooking them this way made a really nice contrast with the creaminess of the icing and the cookies stayed very crisp without any sogginess.  I also used less powdered sugar since the sugar tends to make the cream cheese more runny.\n\nSeveral office workers said it was the best cookie they had ever had.\n\nPictures listed in the photo section.",

A few changes I made were I added 1/2 package fat-free vanilla pudding mix to the cream cheese filling. It just adds to the yummyness! I used apples, peaches, grapes, bananas and strawberries. One tip, after spreading your fillin gon freeze the crust with filling for about an hour or so then remove it and cut it inthe pan to the servings you want. THEN arrange your fruit on top of your serving cuts. I still managed to have a very nice looking presentation on the whole and was much easier to serve instead of trying to cut through the fruit. Thank you for the great recipe!",
