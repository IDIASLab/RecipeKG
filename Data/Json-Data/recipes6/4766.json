I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I just made it in a large pot,  I read the comments before I began.  My critical husband & a visiting family friend thought it was delicious & to be added to our family staples.  To make the most of the favors in the ingredients I added things differently than given for the slow cooker.  First I saut\u00e9ed the garlic & onion in about a tablespoon of olive oil.  I added the celery to this, then the crushed tomatoes; while these simmered, I added the carrots.   We have a deck garden of fresh herbs so I used them + dried for those I didn't have.  To the tomato mixture I added about 1-T-fresh Oregano, the dried thyme, black pepper, fresh parsley, & fresh spinach.  When this began to boil I added the vegetable broth, kidney beans, & remaining vegetables.  When these came to a slow boil, I added the macaroni using varied vegi colored elbow macaroni & salt.  When the pasta was cooked, we ate.  We topped the soup with the Parmesan as described & it was fantastic.  The favors were perfect for us.",

I normally don't review recipes if I make a change but the changes I made were after the soup was almost done. As another reviewer stated, there wasn't enough liquid to support the elbows so I keep them separate. Put them in the bowls then ladled the soup over. Also added the green Tabasco. Perfect! There is a review that says the recipe is unsafe because the kidney beans need to be cooked first. I wanted to point out that the recipe calls for canned kidney beans which are completely cooked before canning! Duh. Enjoy the soup everyone.",

Add more veggies, chicken broth or \u201cclean out your fridge\u201d\u2019with this one...so versatile. \nBut please don\u2019t give this a negative review because there\u2019s not enough green chipotle jalape\u00f1o Tabasco spicy spice for your taste because this is MINESTRONE, not southwest chipotle bean soup!\n\nI don\u2019t believe this soup is a good candidate for a slower cooker tho. Definitely don\u2019t need that much time. You can throw this together in under 30 min on the stove top. Why would anyone want to cook fresh veggies and pasta for 6-8 hours?! You\u2019d have a big over cooked pot of mush...just saut\u00e9 onions, garlic, celery, carrots in a couple TBLS of good olive oil, throw in your tomatoes, stir around for a couple minutes, add a couple small unpeeled cubed red potatoes, pasta, beans, broth,seasonings...everyone in the pot!...and cook at a medium boil for 15 min. Check for salt & pepper and That\u2019s it! Delicious bowl of soup!",
