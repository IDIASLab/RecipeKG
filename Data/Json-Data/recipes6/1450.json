I'm just one guy live by myself and never married so I didn't take and spoon out all kinds of seasonings Tsp this Tbl sp of that. And I just sprinkled on all of the seasonings after I smeared on a coating of Olive Oil so the seasonings will stick to the chops. They were very dry. I had almost 4 lbs of center cut chops called Iowa Chops. A HUGE pack of it with 3 center cuts in it and real thick. I sprinkled all the seasonings on both sides of 2 of them and rubbed it in. I should have only cooked one couldn't eat the other. Steve",
