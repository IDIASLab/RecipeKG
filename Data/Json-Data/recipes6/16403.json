The flavor is too tart...perhaps too much white wine vinegar or lemon juice in the recipe and it left an odd aftertaste. It took a while to prepare and I was disappointed with the outcome. It might go better in a salad or with a different style of a meal but I didn't care for this recipe.",

The tangy vinegar is a great combo with the blue cheese. Try substituting a good quality creamy gorgonzola for the blue cheese. Gorgonzola is similar but tends to have a bit less bite which is good for people who are leary of blue cheese.",
