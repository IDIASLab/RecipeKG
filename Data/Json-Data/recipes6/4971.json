Oh we did use a no salt added chicken broth instead of beef broth but with onions and a little ketchup they were awesome. I was surprised by how great the texture is. Will make a gain for sure. Way better than store bought vegie burgers. We served with baked sweet potato fries. Next time we will likely add some grated carrot and maybe some bell pepper or maybe some zucchini. I think the options are almost limitless. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
