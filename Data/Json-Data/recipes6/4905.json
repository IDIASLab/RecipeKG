The one note I will add because it doesn't show well in the picture is the sazon seasoning turns the rice pink to red in color! Some people seemed a little disturbed by the appearance but immediately forgot it when they tasted how wonderful the rice was. I think warning people ahead that they are going to get a \"festive\" change in rice color will alleviate the surprise and help them fully enjoy this great recipe. I know I will be making it over and over- particularly on any red-themed holidays! Love it-",
