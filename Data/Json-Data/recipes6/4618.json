And second, the flavors and spices are spot on! I've made it several times as is and I feel like I can now mention my own twists on the original. One, replace the butter with equal amount coconut oil for a healthier fat and complimentary flavor with the ginger. Two, don't puree it! It is such a pretty stew as is! And three, the last five minutes of simmering, throw in about 4 cups of fresh, chopped spinach for a boost in color and nutrients. Take my word for it--this recipe is worth making!",

I coarsely chopped up all the veggies and apple and tossed them in a lightly sprayed roasting pan, I then lightly sprayed them and seasonsed them with all the spices.

I will save this meal for special occations such has family holiday get togethers or pot luck dinners. Also next time I think I will leave it as a stew instead of pureeing it (pureeing it gives it a babyfood look and tecture).",
