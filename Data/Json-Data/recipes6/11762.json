Apples sliced thin w/skin on for added color.  Looked pretty; confetti color.  I would not suggest using a tart apple such as granny smith; feel it would be too sour.  The salad needed 'something'.  Made the caramel sauce from 'bananas in caramel sauce' by Sarah Hand from this site and that brought it up to snuff.  Salad itself was a bit boring without.  Layered salad with sauce and also drizzled over top with a few more peanuts.",

I also added an extra apple (red delicious) and left the peels on all of them to add some color. With the red green and white colors it would be a pretty salad for Christmas. I left out the peanuts since I'm bringing it to a friends who has allergies but will try it with the peanuts next time. Also this is a taffy apple salad not a caramel apple salad. UPDATE Had it with lightly salted cocktail peanuts this time and it's 10 times better than without.",
