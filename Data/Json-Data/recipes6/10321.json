I was suprised to see that the bananas weren't mixed into the cake but with the end result I realized why. With the bananas on top with the sugar/cinnimon sprinkled on the top makes the bananas creamy and they seep into the cake. It was the best cake I've had in a long time. My husband is taking it to work to share tomorrow because he likes it so much! I am definitly keeping this recipe!!! Thank YOU!!!!!! ___________________________________ I need to add on that I think this recipe should be refridgerated. The bananas seemed to go bad really quickly.",

That might be just me though...since it said banana bread I let the bananas let the bananas get overripe like I do for my normal banana bread and that may have been my mistake. I do like the cinnamon-sugar on the top. If you sprinkle it evenly the lemon juice isn't really necessary because the bananas are covered in cinnamon and brown anyway. Overall I would probably make it again but I might incorporate the bananas in the cake instead of having them on top but I'd still do the cinnamon sugar topping.",

After reading the sponge cake tips on allrecipes I am pretty sure it was because I didn't handle the eggs correctly. The taste was great but I think the heavy density was my own error not necessarily this recipe so I gave this 4 stars and can't wait to try this again. Next time I'll make this with room temp eggs beaten just to stiff peaks and then gently fold in the beaten eggs. All were tips I got from the baking section on this site. This might be the difference between those who thought it was more like a cake vs bread.",
