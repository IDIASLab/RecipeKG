I prefer a milder onion flavor so I used scallions and I used unrefined coconut oil instead of butter. I don't eat peanuts so instead of peanut powder I used almond powder and finely ground cashews which are fairly sweet so I omitted the sugar. Next time I'll add just a bit more cumin seed to enhance the smoky flavor. This was perfect with Indian Dahl with Spinach also from this site.",

This is what I did and it turned sort of a sick grey. When I made the salad it was crisp and absolultly beautiful. I would say that maybe 2-3 hours in the fridge would bring out the flavors without wrecking the gorgious fresh color of the salad. I also added bell peppers along with the chilis because I wanted more color and less spice. All in all this was a very good recipe. I rate it five stars for the recipe and 3 stars for the reviews.;)",
