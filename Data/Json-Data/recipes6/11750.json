A couple helpful hints - I put the sugar, and instant coffee in my coffee grinder and gound them up to powder. Also add the nutmeg to the grinder with the sugar and that will help it dissolve better. I also added a bit more sugar than the recipe called for because I like it sweeter.  I bought little bags at a packaging store, and gave this out for christmas gifts.  I got a lot of compliments on it.\nThanks for a great recipe!",

I went ahead and used 1 C. of coffee left out the spices and used Irish Creme flavored creamer instead of plain. My secret for smoother texture: I used powdered sugar in place of granulated which works excellent in this recipe. I mixed this using 24 oz. hot water to 4 Tbsp. mix put it over ice and topped it with a little shot of milk really good! Finally a tasty (and cheaper) version of my favorite iced drink!",
