Although moist the cake itself was dense and dark in color from all of the brown sugar so you could not see any swirls. The best way to describe the flavor is sort of like a spice cake. I didn t deviate from the recipe at all (and I did use cake flour) but I think both the cranberries and the hazelnuts need to be doubled. I had a hard time finding hazelnuts and when I did they were very expensive. If you have the same situation IMO pecans would make a good substitution. I checked at 70 minutes and it already was a bit overdone. I d recommend you start checking at about 60-65 minutes acknowledging that oven temps can vary greatly. Don t need to sound negative it was good but the texture and the appearance just weren't what I was expecting.",

I also only baked it for 45 min...this could have been due to my inconsistent oven though. Delicious!!!",
