As much as I cook, I still cannot get rice to work, so how was I going to make something as complicated as risotto?  Thanks to this recipe (my inaugural attempt), my risotto was wonderful.  Being a WeightWatcher girl, I did not add the parmesan cheese to the top (didn't miss it) and added lots of veggies.  I too rough chopped my zucchini, and added chopped fresh broccoli and sweet peas (at the very end).  I'd recommend carrots too.\r\n\r\nOne happy note: I did not \"stir continuously\".  Instead I used a very good pot and stirred \"quite often\", until the end.  When the mixture thickened, I \"stirred continuously\" and voila! No blob.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the great recipe.",

I was cooking for 2 so I scaled back the ingredients as follows(which made enough for 3):  \n\n4 cups chicken broth\n1 tablespoon butter\n1 cup rice\n1/2 sweet onion chopped\n2 small carrots chopped\n5 sun dried tomatoes (used the kind packed in oil) \n1 zucchini chopped\n1 tablespoon dried thyme\n3 tablespoons fresh grated parmesan\n~ 12 small basil leaves sliced width-wise\n\nI sauteed the carrots and onions together first, then added the rice and followed the rest of the recipe as instructed.  Carrots sweeted it up a bit and the basil should not be skipped - it added a really nice flavor.  With constant stirring over medium heat, the risotto probably took about 30 minutes total to cook.  My fiance liked it and I enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will make this again!",

It was nowhere near bland despite the fact that I forgot to add the thyme completely. My sundried tomatoes were marinated with herbs and that more than a made up for the lack of thyme. I like my veggies chunky and crunchy so I cut the zucchini into bigger bits but I may slice them thinner next time as the recipe suggest as my boyfriend said the chunks reminded him of his childhood when he didn't like zucchini as a side dish. Fair enough. Will definitely make this healthy feeling and delicious risotto again.",
