Simply put it back on the stove, add a little water if needed, and warm it up. There is a lot of prep, especially because of making the meatballs homemade, but it is so worth it. My very favorite soup and full of good ingredients! My kids and husband love it too! Serve with Parmesan cheese and toasted bread.",
