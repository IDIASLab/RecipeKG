I froze the pulp so I could investigate on what to do with this strange orange stuff!  This bread is fantastic!  It is super moist and tasty.  The spices are just right.  Only had one problem and that was getting out out of the bread loaf pans.  Doesn't matter if it's glass or metal pan.  I will try greasing them better next time and maybe even add a touch of flour to the bottom of the pan.  Regardless of a few pock marks on the bottom of my loaves, it is DELICIOUS!  ADDENDUM:  I solved the sticking on bottom of pan problem with parchment paper!  It worked great and I use it in glass, metal, or even the throw away foil pans.  I bring it up on the sides a touch, too.  The bread still browns nicely!  (If you use the fuyu persimmons, the stickiness is not a problem - I learned that this year 2014.)",

However, my husband swears this is the only dessert bread he will eat and the first time I made this for my father-in-law, he kept pushing persimmons from his tree on me. My mother-in-law said she could eat a whole loaf on her own, and every time I've brought this bread over for a holiday gathering, it disappears.\nWith that said, here are a few cooking suggestions: instead of 3 cups white sugar I add 2.5 cups of brown sugar and instead of regular oil I add olive oil (healthier and brings out the spice). I love spices in my bread (everyone is different) so I add more nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. I also add ground cloves (I dont' know how much, I eye it and add to taste). Alternatively, you can add pumpkin spice. For a moister bread, add a bit more persimmon pulp. To prevent bread from sticking, I find it best to purchase those disposable aluminum foil pans and spray those with PAM cooking spray. I NEVER get sticking and this also prevents overcooking of the \"crust.\" Additionally, there's no pan clean up required. This recipe is extremely easy to make and is incredibly forgiving (can make a few subsitutions or mistakes and it still turns out decent).",

This recipie is even better enjoyed by family and co-workers and is a definite hit with my year-old nephew. The bread is moist delicious and keeps for three or four days so it makes a wonderful gift idea. I have not tried freezing the bread so I can't say the flavor will change after defrosting. Another note- with only one bread pan I baked the remainder of the batter in a springform cake pan with cooking parchment on the bottom. The bread came out wonderfully and has the potential for all sorts of presentation ideas such as a multi-layered holiday cake or a component in a trifle.",

I\u00e0m in Italy right now and persimmons (cachi or kaki) are in season right now and they are the best things EVER so I thought I would see what I could make with them! I found this recipe and have made it several times now. The only thing I change is the amount of sugar. 3 cups seemed like WAY too much cuz persimmons are so sweet to begin with! (You have to wait until they are almost rotten to eat them...that's when they are so sweet and juicy and delicious! yum!). I\u00e0m guessing all the sugar was for if you use persimmons when they are not yet ripe...then I think they are quite bitter. But trust me...wait until they are cracking and ready to fall out of their skin. They are SO GOOD!!!! Thanks! (PS. I made this in a ciambellone pan...maybe the same as a bundt cake pan? instead of the smaller loaf pans. Great!)",
