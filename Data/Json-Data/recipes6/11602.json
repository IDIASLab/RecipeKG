They put a 3oz custard in the middle of the soup bowl and poured the soup on top then put sauted mushrooms on top of the custard. I don't care for mushrooms but thought I would share. You could make custard using those little pyrex serving finger bowls and then turn upside down in the pan. Flavor the custard anyway you like. The restaurant's custard didn't have much taste but the texture coupled with the soup was great.",

If you love chestnuts and want to make a soup with them this is the way to go. However both my husband and I thought the soup was really sweet and rich and something we'd prefer to eat only once a year (holiday time). Just FYI the soup is best in small portions - 1/2 cup appetizer before a large turkey/potatoes/stuffing meal. Not as a soup-for-dinner. (Duh. We tried the latter and got really sick of it really quickly.)",
