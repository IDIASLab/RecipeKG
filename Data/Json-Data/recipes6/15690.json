I added fresh garlic, the juice of half of a lime, about a cup of a good jarred brushetta and because I didn't have green pepper on hand, I used a small can of green chilies. I'm not big on cilantro or tarragon but added some spices of my choice. I really thought there was too much liquid at first, but after hours of marinating the beans soaked up the liquid perfectly. Yum!",

A meal all by itself. The dish as I prepared it deserved 4.5 stars. Next time I will tweak the oil and produce a 5-star salad!",
