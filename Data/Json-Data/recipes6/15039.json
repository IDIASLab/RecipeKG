The flour amount is correct, it is scant because it takes into account that quite a bit of extra flour is needed for rolling out the lefsa.  My MIL's tip was not to add the flour all at once.  Divide the potato mixture into enough for 10 lefsa per batch and add the proportionate flour to mix in just before you roll the dough.  You won't have to add as much flour to the rolling surface and will have more tender lefse.  Also..if your potatos are very moist, either dry them in the oven or cut back on the amount of cream you add to the dough.  You don't want to develop too much of the gluten in the flour which makes the lefsa rubbery or tough.   Lefsa it easiest to bake with two people; one to roll out the lefsa and one to mind the griddle!",

                "reviewBody": "I grew up in a Norwegian family where we ate lefse 3 times a day for the whole Christmas season! My mom & I make lefse every year. We're always frustrated with our recipe not rolling out properly. This is the best recipe we have used to date! Here are some tips we've learned through the years...hope this helps other's trying to make this yummy treat!!!\n- The flour amount is perfect!! But use LOTS of flour in a sifter to sprinkle on your pastry board, rolling pin and dough to prevent sticking. That extra flour used for rolling probably doubles the flour amount used. Too much flour makes the lefse rubbery. \n- Divide dough up into several logs rolled in wax paper and keep the extra's in the fridge. Cold dough is easier to work with.\n- Use a kitchen scale and weigh each hunk of dough before rolling.\n- Use a cloth cover over your pastry board and rolling pin to prevent dough from sticking.(can be purchased or make your own with unbleached cotton) Keep extra's on hand to swap if they get too moist (hand wash them...or use mild detergent & no fabric softener)\n- Have lots of patience, a friend to work with and cushy slippers to stand on! This full recipe with 2 people will take about 6 hrs & yield about 80-100 8\" pieces if rolled 1/16\" thin. (1/8\" is too thick)\n- Practice! Your first few may not turn out so well. \n- BTW...A pizza stone makes a great lefse rolling board!\n- If you want to make lefse often...invest in a good corrogated rolling pin - it does make a difference!\n- Enjoy!",

Our grandma was a 5th-generation immigrant from Norway who settled in WA she brought this family recipe with her. Interestingly we ate it the same way as you do: Rolled up with butter and sugar! According to Wikipedia this is a variation called tynnlefse or \"thin lefse\" and rolling it up with butter and sugar is called \"lefse-klining\". The lefse griddle I purchased also came with a similar recipe but it called for 4 cups of flour! I believe I ended up splitting the difference and using about 3 cups: When it had the consistency of Play-Dough that was the time to stop adding flour. It does want to stick to EVERYTHING: I found that to get it really thin like Grandma's you have to spread flour over it GENEROUSLY both on your work surface and on the top which contacts your rolling pin. Which is fine because I remember the lightly floury texture the lefse always had. Thank you so much. The picture looked JUST like my grandma used to make! I'm afraid I cried into my lefse it brought back so many wonderful family memories!",
