I enjoyed this and will make it again.  I used a leaner turkey sausage.  Since the recipe doesn't call for any oil or cooking spray when you brown the sausage or the cook the garlic/onions/peppers, I assumed it was because I was supposed to cook the vegetables in the fat that cooked out of the sausage.  I had no cooked-out fat, so I added a small amount of olive oil to the skillet instead.  This worked out well for me.  In the future, I might grill the sausage outdoors, then slice and add to the vegetable mixture at the end.  Thanks, tiffschrie!",

I also used a can of diced tomato because it's all I had and I didn't have any pimento (I thought I did when I chose this recipe) but I used everything else as how it's written. However because it was kielbasa and didn't need to brown as raw sausage needs to I started everything in the skillet at the same time as I started the rice. I used brown basmati so that takes a while to cook - and everything was so delicious and we will definitely be making this regularly!! Yum!",
