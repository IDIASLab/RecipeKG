I had made these changes: 1 tsp of cumin instead of 1/4 tsp 1/2 package of frozen spinach instead of kale added about 1 tsp of garam masala. I didn't have any cilantro but I think that would have been good. Also I thought the vegetable would get too mushy cooked the way the recipe said so I cooked the lentils with the broth and spices (only took about 15 minutes) and then added the sauted onions through garlic and cooked until done.",

The fact that it is vegetarian and could easily be made vegan by subbing olive for the butter is an added bonus.  My lentils were tender in only 25 minutes; lentil cooking times vary greatly depending on how long they have been stored, so I would advise checking them to make sure that you do not end up with mush.  I used 1 teaspoon of cumin and did adjust the seasoning at the end by adding some Himalayan sea salt, which I thought was sorely needed, perhaps because I used low sodium vegetable broth.  File powder is ground sassafras leaves used for both flavoring and thickening.  I don\u2019t think it was necessary to thicken this soup but the file powder in addition to the other spices added a wonderful complexity to the flavor.  It can be ordered from Penzeys.com if your grocery does not carry it.   I will definitely make this soup again!",

I did not have all of the ingredients, so here are my modifications:  Did not use file powder. I don't think it's needed as the soup is just the right consistency in my opinion.  No allspice, so increased the amount of cumin and added garam masala as first reviewer did. Added a little bit of dried ginger (sorry, i didn't measure). No Kale on hand - used frozen spinach instead, with great results.  I used a little more butter than what was called for and once soup was done and had cooled ever so slightly, I added some nonfat sour cream which I think made it extra delightful!  I normally don't use salt when cooking anyway, but did add some garlic salt at the end as I am a garlic lover.  I also used dried cilantro as I didn't have fresh. Play around with this one; it's very versatile!  Thank you for the recipe!",
