So much easier than making it on the stove because you don't have to keep an eye on it, and you can have this going while you prepare other things. Set it and forget it, it basically makes itself!  I love that it uses frozen shrimp and is done so quickly. Perfect for those times you have unexpected company or just want a quick mid-day snack. I used a lager for the beer and it was so good! I will be making this often and make sure to have crusty bread next time to dip into the delicious broth!",
