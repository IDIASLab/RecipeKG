I used 1 cup of milk instead of 1 and 1/2, and I don't add any sugar. In addition to what's listed here, I add 1/4 cup steel cut oats, 1 tablespoon chia seeds, and 1/3 cup shredded coconut. If I have carrots on hand I shred some and add that as well, it reminds me of carrot cake when I do this. I also don't measure the chopped apple, i just chop one up and use it all. This is a great recipe, but don't be afraid to customize to your preference.",

I also used pecans instead of walnuts. I love the fact that it doesn't call for eggs. To get in our omega-3, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of ground flax-chia seed blend. Also, I found this recipe is not overly sweet. It has the perfect amount of sugar for our taste. This will become part of our regular meal rotation. Fantastic!",
