I remember the first time I made it our friends the Zacharys were over for dinner and their eyes opened so wide when I walked out with this dessert. All I can say is that the semifreddo platter and everyone's plates were empty. Give this recipe a try if you want to impress your friends. It's gluten-free. Serve garnished with extra raspberries or puree some of the raspberries with a teaspoon of honey and drizzle on top.",
