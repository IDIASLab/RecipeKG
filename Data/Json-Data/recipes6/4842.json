Of course I tried this! It is cheap and easy to make. However I think \"stirring occasionally\" is a bit of an understatement. It might just be my poor-quality pot but the recipe began to stick to the bottom of it after about half an hour. I had to stir every couple/few minutes. Maybe it is because the recipe does not specify whether we simmer with lid on or off (I did off)? I topped with emmental!",

But it's good with or without. Someone said it was sticking to her pan and wondered if it was because she simmered it with the lid off. YES that's the reason. Bring everything to a boil then give it a good stir reduce to simmer stick the lid on and give it a maybe only two or three more quick stirs over the next hour. The end texture of the Freekeh should be somewhat chewy like a soft rice.",
