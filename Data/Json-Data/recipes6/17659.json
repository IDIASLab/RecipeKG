                "reviewBody": "This cake is very delicious moist and not to mention absolutely beautiful. The tartness of the cranberries the crunchiness of the nuts and sweetness of the gooey topping complement each other extremely well. I did make adjustments though.For the topping ingredients I chose to chop a few of the cranberries in half so it would cover the bottom of the pan more evenly. I used a mix of crumbled pecans walnuts and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds instead of using only pecans. I didn't have enough sour cream to fill 1 cup so I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup vanilla yogourt which worked just as well. I used an 8\" springform pan and because it is slightly smaller in diameter compared to the average 9\" pan that most people used I knew I had to increase the baking time a little bit. Also according to some reviews 60min was not long enough to fully bake the cake and 350 degrees was too high. From this info I baked my cake at 325 degrees for around 75-80min and it came out perfect and even. For this cake I'd definitely recommend using a pan no bigger than 9\" because it's a pretty short cake. In the future I will continue using an 8\" or maybe even a 7\" pan. For me this cake took quite a bit of prep and baking time but it's definitely worth the trouble and wait. When serving I decorated each slice with a light sprinkle of toasted coconut and a dallop of whipped cream on the side.",

I also found that putting a square of parchment paper at the bottom of the pan (bigger so that the edges are outside the pan in between the bottom and the round) prevent any leakage.",

I followed the batter part exactly but for the topping I used 1/2 c. of butter a 12 oz. bag of cranberries 3/4 c. of nuts (you could use walnuts or pecans) and a little more than 2/3 c. of tightly packed brown sugar. I didn't bother using a saucepan to boil the butter and brown sugar I just used a microwave safe bowl to melt the butter and then added the brown sugar. I put a cookie sheet under the foil lined spring form pan and it took a little longer to bake - about 70 minutes. I drizzled the top with melted white chocolate - mmmmmmmm.",
