Also, I soaked my rice noodles in COLD water for 15 minutes, then cooked in hot curry sauce for approx 5 minutes - I think the hot water method would overcook them. Overall, a great recipe. Thanks!",

It MIGHT be because I accidentally messed up and bought a green curry sauce that already had coconut milk & fish sauce so I used 6 oz of that instead.  The mixture tasted fine, but when I tasted it with the rice noodles it was bland.  So I added salt/pepper and some chili garlic sauce for flavor & heat.  After that it was great.  I also included a diced red bell pepper.  Next time I think I'll add ginger & garlic to the veggies while they cook.",

I think next time i will try to cook it down or thicken it though as the sauce was a little too thin for our tastes. I was surprised how much flavor it had with the few ingredients called for. It didn't need any extra seasoning. We will definitely be back for another try thanks for posting it!",
