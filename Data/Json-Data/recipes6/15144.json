You can use even a cookie sheet and without even chilling it and once it has cooled and the chocolate is set you just sort of twist the metal sheet and the candy will break into pieces. You can hit it with a hard knife spoon or other utensil if the pieces are large and you want to make them smaller. Just a tip I use when I make any hard candy. I also like to put some chopped nuts (preferably pecans) on top of the melting chocolate.",
