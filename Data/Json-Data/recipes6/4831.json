I put the soaked beans in a pot and added  vegetable broth and simmered for a little over an hour until the beans were soft. Next I added the rest of the ingredients (along with an 8oz can of tomato sauce) and let the soup simmer for another hour. At the end I added more salt and pepper, a dash of cayenne, and crumbled bacon. Thanks for the recipe:)",
