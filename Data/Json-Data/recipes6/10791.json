I suggest baking for 50 minutes, remove from pan for 20 minutes, place back in pain and pour the following over the bottom, let it soak in for an hour and then turn upright and dust with confectioners sugar. GLAZE: Blend 1/4 C. confectioners sugar with 1/4 stick melted butter and 1/4 C. Kahlua.  The glaze recommended by TNTKIDS made my cake too wet (as though it wasn't cooked) This variation was just right!!",

Try different combinations of cake mixes different flavors of compatible liqueurs and puddings for this very moist and versatile cake!

Several people had second helpings (including me) and asked for the recipe. I took reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half. It wasn't missed. I cannot imagine leaving out the vodka as one review suggested as it really adds depth to the flavor of the cake. The powdered sugar dusted on top sort of sucks up the liquer so you should wait until you are ready to serve before you dust it on. I also added pretty flat candy sprinkles to give it a more festive look. This moist and delicious cake is one that I will make again and again!:-)",

After sifting the powdered sugar over this cake it soaked in and didn't look very pretty. The sugar on the cake turned a brown color and all around the cake plate was white icing sugar. Also the glaze mixture didn't cover the entire cake. I think next time I will add 1/4 cup more powdered sugar to the glaze and skip sifting the powdered sugar over the top entirely. My boyfriend suggested that next time it might look better if after putting the clear glaze on and letting it cool that I make a second glaze in a thick white or chocolate and pour it over the top so that the edges drizzle down. I think I will try that next time.",

I use a 10 inch bunt and keep it at the temp. the recipe calls for. The thing to remember is that b/c of the pudding in it you want it to be a bit more soft in the middle....so even if you take it out it tends to cook a while after it is out of the oven and \"hardens\" up.
