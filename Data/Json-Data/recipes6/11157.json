I don't rate recipes I have rewritten and changed, and folks who like wheat flour better than I may like this better than I, but it kind of ruined it for me.",

I made this gingerbread with a thick dark home-brewed stout which went really well with the recipe. My only modifications: I left out the orange peel and almonds and doubled the raisins.",

The flavor was subtle I may use a heavier hand with the spices next time. Also I may serve smaller pieces next time or add a frosting (a maple nut was suggested in another review). For the beer I used Blue Moon. It was quick and easy. I will be making it again. Thank you Carol!",
