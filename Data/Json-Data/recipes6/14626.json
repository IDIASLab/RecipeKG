                "reviewBody": "If you try this cornbread, with a few suggestions, you will never make another cornbread recipe.  I rated Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread from this site as the best ever, but this surpasses that one by a long shot!  It is very important though to read reviews where the submitter of the recipe says to beat the entire concoction for at least 5 minutes before dumping it into the pan to cook.  I must admit, I was very skeptical - every bread recipe in the world talks about not over-mixing.  But I couldn't find my staple recipe and feeling adventurous, I gave it a try.  So glad that I did!  What I did was 1) Half the recipe and only use 1/4 c sugar instead of 1/3 c. 2) While the milk/cornbread mixture is sitting for 5 minutes, give it a good whip with a whisk 5-6 times, 3) Beat the entire concoction at least 5 minutes (and set a timer) before dumping in the pan, 4) Put about 2 TBL butter in a 10\" cast iron skillet to melt in your 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes while you are beating the mixture then take it out and pour in the cornbread mixture (believe me - this will make all the difference in the world - it is very important to cook it with a cast iron skillet) 5) Only bake it for 20 minutes!  This will yield you the most fluffy, corny, airy, moist, slightly sweet but not to powerful to go with anything, piece of cornbread heaven in the world!!!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!  It is my staple from now on - I am not even looking for another!",

This is a sweet dense cornbread but I find that it's sweetness is a good complement to a spicy chili.

We also like this at breakfast with a little molasses.",
