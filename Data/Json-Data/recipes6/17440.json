Make sure your oil is hot (flour will bubble away when you sprinkle a little in it) before adding meat.  I also added diced onions during this step instead of the pearl onions later.  After the floured meat is browned, I then added water and followed the recipe as written.  The stew was the perfect color and consistancy when made this way.  As far as taste, it was great all except for the peas.  They were a little overwhelming in flavor.  I think it may have been better to have them cook a little longer so the flavors would mingle better.  Or maybe use canned peas which don't have quite as intense of a flavor as the frozen variety I used.   ",

I confess that one of my pet peeves is people who modify recipes beyond recogniition.  But I believe in being flexible too, so, here are my modifications:  First, I browned the beef with olive oil and added a little salt and white pepper to the beef while browning.  I didn't dredge the beef in flour prior to browning because that would interfere with caramelizing the sugars in the beef.  Second, the can of pearl onions did not sound appetizing to me, so I picked some pearl onions out of my garden and added them to the beef while browning it to caramelize them, bring out their flavor, and add to the flavor and texture of the gravy.  Third, I added two beef bullion cubes to the 3 cups of water and cut back on the salt.   I also used sea salt.  Fourth, I cut the potatoes and carrots a little smaller to suit my taste.  Fifth, I added just a lttle fresh rosemary and thyme out of my garden to it to add a little more wild flavor.  Sixth, I added the peas about 5 minutes before thickening the gravy.  It was delicious, and the leftovers held up well, too.",
