I took the advice of some of the previous reviews and made the following changes;I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to the batter as well as a 1/4 cup of canola oil. I chopped the rhubarb quite fine and used thin stalks. I did not use the topping in the recipe but used a 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon mixed and sprinkled on top. Lastly I seriously question the cooking temp. Most muffins seem to be in the 400 F range and I found them still very undercooked following the recipes directions for time and temp. I had to cook them an additional 8 min. at 400 F. After all that.....it was a good muffin! With these changes I will use it again.",

                "reviewBody": "I think this is a successful non-fat muffin, with a couple of considerations. First, as with any muffin, chop the fruit small. As my rhubarb was already sliced into 1/8\"-1/4\" slices, cutting largest ones in half or thirds was tedious but worth it. Second, for more taste, I used some oat \"flour\" in the batter: I whirled 1 cup of Quick oats in food-processor, and substituted it for white flour (about 1/2 c.?)  Third, I'll add a bit more salt next time: 1 1/4 tsp or 1 1/2 tsp. I also thought that the lack of a fat in the recipe might have been a mistake, but when you look at it as a non-fat recipe, it is good! My topping didn't melt (did I use too little butter?) but did end up looking like chunks of crushed ice perched on the muffin tops. I think I'll just sprinkle with cinnamon/sugar next time.",
