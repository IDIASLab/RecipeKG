I chopped the apples instead of shredding and I used 3 cups total. I substituted homemade applesauce for the butter to make it healthier and because I had a lot! I also used 4 tablespoons cocoa powder. I really enjoyed it my hubby did not like the apple-chocolate combo. Very moist even without the butter. Maybe next time I will shred the apples and see if it changes the result any. I will try this recipe again!",
