I doubled the ingredients and the flavor was spot on!!  They weren't overly sweet and the soy sauce did not overpower the other flavors.  I did add a little season salt and pepper, but that's just because I like my meat seasoned. My husband had seconds and thirds!  He'll be looking for these most weekends.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!",

I found that with this recipe that the chicken tasted better with the chicken seasoned with pepper and season-all. One thing about this is that you need to make the marinade a second time half way though to pour over the chicken during and after cooking. It really caramelizes nicely and really brings out that flavor. This will be a family classic at dinner time at my home.",
