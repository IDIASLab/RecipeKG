It isn't too weird tasting to be a bit skimpy on the flour. Instead of \" beating in the cream and flour alternately\" hit the gas pedal to the floor on that mixer! (okay that was exaggerated but you get it) And don't fold in the butter - FLOG it into the batter! The point is - keep the batter as fluffy as possible and it will go well with you. Also use a 1/3 cup measure when ladling the batter onto a 7-9\" pan and don't be shy with the heat (but don't be preoccupied either if you do crank up the flames). These treat-like crepes will be uber-good with ice cream and/or some fresh fruit.",

I used the yolk and whites because of this. It actually turned out pretty well although the crepes were a little runny at first to flip over. I also had it on low heat unlike the recipe stating high heat... my first crepe burned because of that. I served it with strawberries maple syrup and a few chocolate chips- very yummy!",

I have several recipes that I tend to make more than others because they combine both a nice flavor and a good consistency and yield for the whole family. As far as taste alone goes these are the best I have ever done. However they were very VERY fragile and therefore difficult to handle. I broke about 4 of them and I was being careful. Also I don't feel very good about eating them (my conscience has issues with this recipe) because of the heavy cream in them. I'd make them again but not if I'm feeding a lot of people or if I don't have enough time to dedicate to them. Of course I could try again and see if maybe I did something wrong that would fix that little problem I had.",
