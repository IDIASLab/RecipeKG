This ensures you don't eat all the same hour you made them! However you really should use the entire 7oz jar of creme but keep the other amounts for the filling the same. I didn't even put thick amounts of filling in-between nor can I imagine it because it's very rich BUT my husband who hates SWEETS says this is the best dessert ever! Brags to his coworkers. hehehe Some complained about a \"butter\" taste to it but I think that's from not blending well & using room temp butter. As far as the crust/pie part I used a mixer for the butter and sugar then dumped the rest of the ingredients on top. Doesn't effect taste & you save yourself a bowl! HOWEVER DO NOT OVER MIX!! This is why I mix everything AFTER all the ingredients have been added. Too much = liquid dough & you will have pancakes instead of beautiful puffed cakes. Speaking from experience! Stick in the fridge between batches or even before baking. For best results don't flatten or touch the rounded medium scoop (what I use) after it hits the cookie sheet. Then you'll have perfect puffy pies like you see in everyones picture! After I take it out I use my spatula to cut around any pies that didn't come out perfectly round. Works great instead of trying to do it w/your hand (which makes it obvious)!",

A moon pie is two flat cakes that sandwich a layer of marshmallow and is coated in chocolate like coating. Also delicious.And when you bite it the marshmallow is tough and strings a little. This is more like a Whoopie pie. Tender and cake-like and the filling is tender too. I'll be adding this to my collection and using it. I don't see any reason why you couldn't use cool whip as a filling or maybe even strawberry jam or whatever you like with chocolate that would spread easily. Delicious!",
