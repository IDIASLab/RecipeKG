Otherwise, this is pretty far off the original bars,\n\nThings that need to be corrected to make this recipe like the Starbucks:\n\n~orange in the cream cheese frosting, NOT lemon. You can use grated orange peel (1 - 1 1/2 Tablespoons, or to taste) or orange extract (maybe about 1/2 teaspoon), or a combination of the two.\n\n~There is no whipped cream topping on the Starbucks version--it is melted and drizzled white chocolate only.\n\n~There is no ginger on top of the Starbucks bliss bar--only in the bar itself. The frosting should only have chopped cranberries and then a white chocolate drizzle on top.\n\n~The texture of the bars can be improved by using 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 cup of butter (melted, not softened), and 2 eggs.\n\nThe above changes will get you a much closer version of the Starbucks bars. I also make additional changes based on my personal preference, so stop reading if you want exactly the Starbucks version.\n\nThings that I change based on my personal preferences:\n\n~Add a little orange flavor to the bar batter. 1/4 teaspoon orange extract (in addition to the vanilla extract) or about 2 tablespoons fresh orange juice (I live at high altitude so I need to add more liquid). You could also used grated orange peel--maybe about a Tablespoon.\n\n~I think the Starbucks bars are too sweet--in additi",

I though with the lemon juice added to the frosting, it would cut a bit of the sweet taste, but all it did was give it an interesting \"tang\" that really didn't sit well with the cream cheese.  I made these for family get together for Christmas.  I'll take them because I know there are some there with an extremely sweet tooth, but I won't be making them again.\r\nNever having tasted the original they these were made to taste like, I can't tell you how close the taste is.\r\nIf I do make it again, I will leave off the frosting and not put the chips in either.  Will probably drizzle a lemon juice/powdered sugar icing over the top, but nothing else.",
