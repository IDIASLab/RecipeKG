I made the mistake of only buying an 8 oz. container and the topping was too stiff and difficult to spread.  I didn't pay close attention to the recipe.  Next time I will add TWO 8 oz. containers (or ONE 16 oz) and it should be perfecto!  I also think a touch of vanilla would be great.  I took it to a Labor Day party and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!   The second time around, I made the crust out of vanilla wafers, ground nuts, and confectioners sugar mixture (see the Cocoa Rum Balls recipe on this site).  I didn't add the cocoa.  It was so delicious and the nuts complemented the bananas perfectly.  Try it!",
