For the best batch I did the following differently. I added about 3 Tbsp. of water to the dough to keep it from being tough.  The oil was extremely too hot and so I lowered it to about 275 and cooked it for a little less than a minute per side(this was with the dough rolled to about 1/8 in thick).  After frying it I brushed it with melted butter which enhanced the bread's flavor and helped the sugar to stick.  I also doubled the amount of sugar used for the toping.",

Only difference may have that they lightly brushed them with melted butter before dousing them with cinnamon sugar.  But surprisingly they taste fine without it and the sugar adheres well.  Plus it's much better for us without the added butter.  These fry up nicely with bubbles in the dough and everything.  I'd decrease the amount of oil used for frying (I did mine in the iron skillet) since it gets a little splattery.  Also, my frying time was about 10-15 seconds per side.  So delicious!",

Set up the ironing board covered with several layers of paper towels, line three or four laundry baskets with paper towels, secure several long-handled wooden spoons, start a large pot of oil heating - Then mix this recipe. The children would gather around the kitchen table, each receiving a ball of dough about the size of a small fist, and pull, with their hands, the \"Eiroili\" until thin. there was a competition to get the dough as thin as possible without pulling a hole. They would playfully argue which one would look most like an elephant's ear when it came out of the pot. Opa would then push and hold each \"cookie\" into the pot of oil with a wooden spoon, leaving it   until bubbled and crispy. (Not long!) He would then put each cookie to drain on paper towels on the ironing board, the children sprinkling it with the mixture of sugar and cinnamon. It then went, carefully stacked, into the lined laundry baskets awaiting delivery to friends. What fun! Mmmm, good. Of course, we have repeated this ritual with a new generation. CLeeman",
