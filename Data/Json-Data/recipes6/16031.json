In addition I throw some chopped walnuts on the topmost layer and this really adds punch. Lastly I serve it hot with a scoop of vanilla icecream. All my guests have enjoyed it.",

This is it! I am not supposed to eat much sugar so I substituted 3/4 c of Splenda Blend for the white sugar whole wheat flour for all-purpose and wheat bread for white. The recipe may sound a bit odd (bread on peaches?) but the bread soaks up the butter mixture brown nicely (even using the Splenda Blend) and develops a mouth-watering buttery sweetness. I made mine with a dash of nutmeg added to the butter mixture. Still absolutely yummy. I think that I will try using a few more peaches next time (perhaps mine were too small) and less of the Splenda Blend (maybe 1/2 c). You must try it!",
