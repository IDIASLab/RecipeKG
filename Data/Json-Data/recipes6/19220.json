Texture is that of a chiffon/whipped sweet potato pie that close southern cousin to pumpkin pie. I decreased the sugar to 2/3rds but could have cut it back even more and been happy. The topping really provides enough sweetness. For those with nut allergies I substituted 2/3 cup dry oatmeal for the pecans and just toasted it in a non-stick frying pan with the butter until very lightly browned. Add the brown sugar and keep stirring over medium heat until sugar melts and just starts to clump. add the flour. The crunchy sugar and oats provides the same/similar texture of the nuts.",
