Made as is, they are good, but light - much like a chocolate cake.  I would rather just make a regular 'indulgent' brownie recipe since this one only adds the little bit of w.w. flour. Made a second time, with the following simple tweaks: two whole eggs, all whole wheat flour (not pastry) and 1/2 tsp salt. They had a denser, fudgier texture with a bit more flavor and still retained moistness. I did not add the coffee extract to either batch as I don't have any and have actually never seen it anywhere. A bit of instant coffee might do as a replacement for that as I'm sure it adds to the recipe. I baked the recipe in muffin cups at the indicated temperature and time. Topped with butterscotch icing they made a yummy treat. My kids really liked both versions. Thanks for the recipe.",
