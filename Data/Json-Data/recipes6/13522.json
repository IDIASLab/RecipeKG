One tip, the batter is really thick, so I washed my hands, took my ring off and mixed it with my hands without the apples.  After it was well mixed, I then washed my hands, put my ring on so I wouldn't forget it and added the apples.  Then mixed with a large spatula.  By the way, I used the apple peeler corer slicer and it made the apples the perfect size. Don't you just love this site?",
