The crust wasn't crunchy or crips but it wasn't soggy either- had really nice flavor (had used allspice instead of apple pie spice) This might be because i left out the ground pecans and used instead flour. DEFINATELY DOUBLE FILLING. the end result of doubling is a cheese cake thats roughly 2\" thick. Watch the baking time- check it BEFORE the time is up ALSO...may i suggest instead of Ice cream caramel topping.. (which often tastes and looks a bit weak or fake...) use caramel candies some canned condensed milk and a little bit of butterscotch liquer- melted in a sauce pan over the stove. The flavor will be much richer the color more vibrant and the caramel thicker. I gave it three stars although if I could i would give it 3.5 because it is VERY EASY TO MAKE but the results are consequently not extraordinary.",
