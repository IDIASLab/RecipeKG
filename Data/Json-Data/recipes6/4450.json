I changed this so much it isn't the same recipe - BUT I'll give you credit because I used your recipe as the basis for mine. I started by rinsing the Quinoa a couple of times and then soaking it while I fried 1/2 onion with garlic in olive oil and when it was brown added about 1/4 cup of white wine (allowing for the alcohol to burn off) then added carrots chicken broth and the quinoa. Before serving I added the walnuts. NO bitter taste. This is the first time making and eating Quinoa - thanks for getting me started and achieving 5 results.",

I'm always on the lookout for new ways to cook quinoa because it is so super good for you and this is a nice straightforward way to prepare it. I echo the sentiment of the reviewer who said to follow the directions and RINSE quinoa before cooking. It has a natural coating that is very bitter and must be rinsed off. It takes one minute but means the difference between yummy and inedible.",
