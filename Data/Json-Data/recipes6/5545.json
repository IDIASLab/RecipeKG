I wanted this to have a little thicker consistency so I first melted the cream cheese and butter together (with no milk). The consistency was perfect so I omitted the milk altogether but added two cans of diced green chilis (undrained) and the taste was wonderful. I did not use \"fat-free\" or \"low-fat\" versions of cream cheese. For the rich yummy flavor sometimes you need the fat. Thanks for a great alternative to my corn casserole recipe. This is really quite tasty and made the perfect side dish for tostadas.",
