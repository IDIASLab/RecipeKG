I agree with supplementing the apple mixture with additional spices such as nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, etc.  The trick to keep the batter from getting too runny is to soften the butter, not melting it.  My \"secret weapon\" with this recipe is a teaspoon of almond extract in the batter - this takes an already easy delicious recipe over the top. ",

Since it was more like a cobbler and my group was 10 I used a rectangle casserole pan and 1 1/2 times the recipe. My pan was an 8x9 with probably a 1 1/2\" side. If you use a 9x12 pan you need to double the recipe. For apples. 7 medium granny smith. I peeled sliced and dropped along the way into a bowl of water and lemon juice.  This keeps the apples white while you peel. I mixed 1 tablespoon white sugar, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nut meg. After draining and drying of a bit of excess water with a paper towel from the apples I sprinkled and glazed them with the mixture and poured them into a bare pan.  For topping the trick is to not over melt the butter.  Just soften the butter.  Wisk 1 egg, 1.5 cups flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/5 tsp nutmeg. Mix these altogether. Since the topping is not pourable just a large clump at a time of topping and then spread as evenly as possible over apples.  It will spread out perfectly while baking.  Bake at same temperature and time or until golden brown.  The top comes out crispy.  Since there is no pie shell you don't need to treat your casserole pan with butter or oils.  Every drop comes out of the pan without sticking.  Treating it would just make the dish too buttery.  It was wonderul and devoured.  It was better than a cob",

You may want to put a pan or piece of aluminum foil underneath the pie plate in the oven, as some juices from the apples escaped during baking.  I served the pie warm, with scoops of vanilla ice cream on top.  Yum!",
