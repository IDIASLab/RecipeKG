Suggestions: cream butter vanilla and sugars very well (3-5 min) use all butter (so two sticks ROOM TEMP) and no shortening and watch them like she says and take them out before they brown. My family had stars in their eyes while eating these! You can also freeze some to pull out later if you don't have a lot of people to gobble them up. BTW - people who said this cookie \"wasn't soft\" try the recipe again and follow the directions to the T. If you didn't get a soft cookie something went wrong..",

I have tried so many recipes. I was always looking for an Entenmanns-tasting recipe. This one comes so close but who cares...it's close enough. I'll never use another recipe. If you take them out just when the centers do not look \"wet\" anymore they will be perfect. Tip: To keep them chewy place them in a ziplock bag with a piece of bread. Change the bread as it starts to become stale.",

I started making these on my day off Wed. so now the kids in the neighborhood will call and ask are we having cookies this week? I even added some white chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips in these together. It also says something about not doubling the recipe. Well I changed mine to 48 servings in which I think is 12 dozen. I cook them for about 10 mins. and they turn out really chewy and little crunchy. But it can be done because I make LOTS for the kids around here. Thanks so for the recipe...and the kids thank you also.",
