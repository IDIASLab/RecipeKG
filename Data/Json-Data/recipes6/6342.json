We did NOT mix the bleu cheese into the meat we didn't have onion so we used onion and garlic powder and I used about 1-2 tbsp. of buffalo sauce instead of 1/3 cup. The mixture seemed too mushy to add all of the liquid. I also let the mixture stand in the fridge for a bit before forming the patties so they could set up a little. I think this was an important step. We grilled the chicken patties grilled the buns sprinkled the bleu cheese crumbles on top of the cooked patties and squirted more sauce on the buns. Dip in Ranch if you want to be really bad. All in all I wasn't too sure about my first go-round with ground chicken but these were MUCH better than expected and will be made again.",

I also added some poultry seasoning for a little more flavor. I followed the advice of the reviewers and made 8 patties with the blue cheese in the middle. Then I froze them on wax paper for 15 minutes or so for easier grilling. I topped these with letttuce and wing sauce mixed with mayo for a condiment. If I make these again I would make them the same way but also add extra blue cheese as a topping (I couldn't really taste it)",
