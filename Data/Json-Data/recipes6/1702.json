I choose this recipe for the first Canadian Allrecipes Allstar challenge because I had all the ingredients and liked the fact the recipe did not contain corn syrup. I halved the recipe which yielded 30 3 inch tarts. I used premade tarts shells because I needed to transport them and I find them easier. The tarts smelled awesome while baking just like what you imagine they should smell like. The only complaint and it is a minor one is my husband found them a little too sweet compared to my usual recipe but he also said he could easily eat 10 because they are butter tarts after all! One recommendation I have would be to streamline the ingredients a little bit e.g. 10 tbsps milk is 2/3 cup 1 2/3 tbsps of vanilla is 5 tsps it just felt a little awkward.",

I used brown sugar Splenda Mix instead of regular brown sugar so I didn't find it too sweet as dd the previous reviewer (matter of taste too.) The pastry was simple and easy to make and roll plus turned out nice and flaky. I would have like the filling to be a bit thinner and runnier (Gooey-er) but that is a minor thing. Overall great recipe!",
