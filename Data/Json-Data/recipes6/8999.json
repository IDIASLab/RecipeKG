Didn't have quite enough cups of cheese so I had slices of real Kraft cheese. Very creamy, not dry, very yummy with homemade bread a salad!",

I think its also best to mention the fact that the macaroni should be cooked while the ground beef is browning.

The changes I made were to use corkscrew pasta, I used 1 and a half cans of the tomatoes,  added a small can of diced green chile, seasoned with Lawrys seasoning salt (found it was too bland without it), and I used more cheese.  Also, make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it might get mushy since you are also cooking it more in the oven. Since all of the ingredients are already cooked when you put everything together, I baked at 375 covered for 10 minutes, then uncovered for an additional 5.  Served with sour cream. It was delicious and made amazing leftovers!",
