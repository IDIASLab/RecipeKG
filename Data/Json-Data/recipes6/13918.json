The obligatory, ubiquitous potato salads I have made for years seemed so blah. I had some really yummy potato salad at a salad bar the other night and was looking for a new recipe that came close to it. It seemed like it had celery seed in it and maybe some dill. The potatoes themselves also seemed to have something extra. I scaled this to make only \u00bc of the recipe and added some dill weed and sour cream. I only marinated about 4 hours. It was plenty of time for the potatoes to soak up the marinade. It wasn\u2019t as sweet as I thought it would be. I also threw in a couple of hard-boiled eggs even though the restaurant version didn\u2019t have any. It wasn\u2019t exactly like the one from the salad bar. In fact it may even have been better. I actually enjoyed eating the potato salad for a change. I will make this again.",

It does make the potatoes softer, so if you like your potatoes a little firmer, maybe this recipe isn't for you.  I really like the sweet and tangy flavor the marinade gives the potatoes.  It really penetrates the potatoes, so that the flavor isn't all in the mayo mixture.  I have made this for family gatherings and have received compliments on it.",

I followed the recipe except that I cooked the potatoes a bit longer than suggested (1/2 hour) by accident and I used 1 1/2 cups of water/vinegar/sugar for the marinade to better cover all the potatoes. \"Hands-down the best potatoe salad I have eaten in my 36 years on the planet.\" was the review via email from a co-worker later in the day. This is the only potatoe salad recipe I will use from now on. The vinegar/sugar marinade really imparts a wonderful flavor to the potatoes and the mayo/celery seed add the final touches. Very simple and extremely tasty. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I have made it several times as is and with minor changes; such as using a little dill juice from the pickle jar a little less sugar. The best time saver I have found is to buy a couple of boxes of store brand scallopped potatoes on sale put the sauce envelope in the pantry and using only the dehydrated potatoes..boil them for about 15-16 min then drain and put in bowl pour marinade over the potatoes as per recipe. Proceed with recipe and is best made the day before using. Thanks Bud.",
