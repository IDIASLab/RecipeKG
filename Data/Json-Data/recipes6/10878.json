I included about a cup of frozen blueberries that I tossed with some flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom and added some fresh lemon zest (about a tsp.) to the batter for a bit more lemony taste. However the temperature of 300 for 1 hour just didn't cut it (and my oven thermometer is working). The cake was barely beginning to brown on top at 55 minutes and the batter was still \"jiggly\" so I cranked up the heat to about 350 and cooked it for another 15 minutes. Cooled it on a wire rack for 15 minutes and then removed the sides of the tube pan. Cooled it completely on the tube part of the pan and then loosened the bottom and tube part with a knife and turned it over on a large round platter.",

I changed the lemon to vanilla and upped it to 1 ts and added 1 cup chocolate chips. A very simple light and not really sweet cake which was a nice change. I definately want to try it the lemon way too. I will most likely make this cake again when I have buttermilk to use up.",
