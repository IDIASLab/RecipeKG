I've been looking for a recipe for fried scones that I had in Salt Lake City and I really hoped this would be it but I was sorely disappointed. The scones I was looking for had a sweet fluffy quality. These were heavier than I had hoped and tasted yeasty (even after smothering them in melted honey-butter) more than anything... but I probably didn't do something quite right. I'll keep searching and maybe I'll give this recipe another shot somewhere down the line.",

I was able to feed 2 teenage boys, dad, toddler and myself..there's enough left overs to fill our bellies again. I made them into the 2.5\" circles. Yes, I will make again!!",
