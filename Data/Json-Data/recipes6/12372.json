I did the \"dough\" in my food processor, and it never really came together, it was just a powdery mixture.  I thought it wouldn't work, but went ahead with it anyways and it all came together during baking.  These turned out really well.  For those of you that said the dough part didn't have any real flavor, it's probably due to the shortening.  Shortening has no real flavor (plus it's yucky and bad for you).  Try butter, it's so much better!",

It is crumbly, but I just added a little liquid (water mixed with lemon juice and vanilla for extra flavor) to the half of crumbs used for the base, and pre-cooked it for about 5 minutes.  The base was not nearly as crumbly as the top this way.  FYI, I used frozen berries for this, without defrosting first, and it baked up perfectly in the same amount of time.\n\nETA that I have only ever used butter with this recipe- I do not cook with shortening.  I also use at least half whole wheat flour. Healthier and tastier!  ",

I used real butter instead of the shortening and it made a HUGE difference in the taste. Delicious! Since fresh blueberries are not in season now, I used frozen Maine blueberries (very big bag for under $5.00) that were purchased in the freezer section at Costco.) I didn't thaw them, just used them directly from the bag and the bars came out fantastic. I made these bars several times and found that you have to bake them a bit longer to get them lightly browned on top..I baked them for 55 minutes. Also, when topping with the remaining crumbs, make sure you squeeze the crumb mixture in your hands to form the crumbs before sprinkling on the top.",

I also used frozen berries, straight from the freezer and the result was good although if you do this, you'll need to add to the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  It's also a good idea to add an extra tsp. of corn starch and be sure to let them set up for an hour or two before cutting for a clean cut.  These would be really good served on a plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks!",

I agree they are kind of like a crumb pie (especially having tasted it while it was still warm 'cause hubby and I couldn't bear to wait til dinner time)! Anyway, I beat the egg a little before adding it to the dough then worked the cut up two sticks of margarine (I think real butter would make these OUTSTANDINGLY rich and yummy), and egg in with my clean fingers until it was fairly crumbly-works better for me. I also added one more Tb. of cornstarch just because it has been my experience that most berry recipes never set up as much as I like. Be sure to lightly oil your pan. I also baked them at a slightly lower tempurature (my oven is weird), and added just a dash of cinnamon as well as a tiny dash of nutmeg to the crumb mixture. We're going to serve big squares of this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side kind of like pie or cobbler because as others have said they are kind of crumbly. Thanks for a wonderfully good and simple recipe!",
