The recipe says makes 12 but I followed it almost exactly and got 18 standard size muffins. The only thing I changed was going half oil & half applesauce. The slightly sweet is just right I think and I cut up 2 regular size apples (which was about 2 1/3 c. when chopped) and that was plenty. They're a little crumbly but that might be because of the oil change. Or because we ate them too quickly after taking out of the oven:) Will try following recipe exactly next time & see how they turn out.",
