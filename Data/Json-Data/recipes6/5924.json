I'm not a vegetarian but these were so good and so filling. I added a half a can of sliced olive (because I had them and I happen to like olives on my tacos) and poured some leftover salsa I had from some Tex Mex take out over the weekend. Next time I will make sure I have some lettuce and shredded cheese with this! It would also be good over some brown rice as like a burrito bowl. Loved it!!",

We didn t have cilantro and I threw in spinach avocado and cheese when I toasted the filling in the tortillas on the skillet. My toddler ate it too but only as a topping for tortilla chips. It looked too good to wait to take a picture but I remembered to snap one after bites had been taken ha. Will definitely make again!",
