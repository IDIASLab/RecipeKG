I made the recipe as stated except I did not have WW flour so used AP, I had old fashioned oats & chopped them up a little in the food processor; I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (a tip from Yummy Peanut Butter Cookies, this site), and 1/2 t cinnamon. Just like What A Dish says in her review, they are soft but crisp on the outside. My husband rated these a 5 and asked for me to make them again. Great cookies Laurie!",

Moreover the cookies did not flatten and only tasted so-so. But the second time I made them I used cookie dough that had been refridgered for several days. Since last time they hadn't flattened I shaped the dough into flat cookie shapes instead of balls and baked them for about 20 minutes in a toaster oven. The results were fantastic cookies that were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a smooth peanut buttery flavor all over. Per other reviewers advice I did make some modifications to the recipe. I omitted the wheat flour and upped the all-purpose flour to 1 cup. I decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup and used natural peanut butter sweetened with honey. I pulverized the oats too and used vanilla sugar instead of vanilla extract.",
