We've always made it with elbow noodles so I made that substitution - otherwise it was just how I remembered! The Worcestershire sauce gives the tomato sauce a \"meaty\" flavor - don't skip it! I made a big batch and froze half before adding the pasta. It tasted great and the whole family went back for seconds. Great hot meal for busy families!",
