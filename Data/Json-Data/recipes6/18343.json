I also frosted it with a cream cheese frosting with cut-up maraschino cherries mixed in- then everyone else thought the little bits of beet they DID find were cherries instead! The top of this cake still is pink although inside is beige. Anything you like with carrot cake would be good with this- chopped nuts coconut on top of cream cheese frosting a little orange mixed in the frosting etc.",

The only thing I changed was to glaze one of the cakes with a warm brown sugar pecan glaze (brown sugar mixed with chopped pecans milk and powdered sugar)and I also left out the allspice because I didn't have any. Both cakes were eaten up and I left the party with an empty plate! If you are worried about an earthy beet taste or picky eaters try using the glaze; pureeing the beets rather than grating them might help too.",

You can taste the beets this way but fortunately my husband likes beets and I (who usually don't care for them) got used to the taste after a while. I would be willing to make this again when I have an excess of beets adding or subtracting ingredients (like raisins choc-chips maybe other fruits). I might try to cook the beets first although I liked the idea of skipping the long boiling process. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used splenda to replace the sugar and next time I make this I think I will replace the oil with applesauce. I made the sheet cake in a 9X13 but I will try the cupcakes for lunchboxes!!
