For one I use a little extra flour when I bake them also I always use tinfoil (shiny side down) when I bake them.

I used butter for better flavor upped the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and used 1 cup each of white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips. They bake up beautifully and perfectly--bakery quality looks. For those having problems with flatness the solutions are simple--do NOT grease the cookie sheets and chill your dough about an hour or so to firm it up a litte before dropping it onto the cookie sheets. Do not add more flour to firm up the dough! A good recipe but not \"the best\" as written.",

I used 1/2 a heaping cup cocoa powder all butter added a teaspoon cinnamon and a smidgen of cayenne pepper. It doesn't add spice persay just some warmth that goes so nice with the sweetness and the richness of the chocolate. I also substituted 2 c. 60% bittersweet chocolate chips and 1 c. chopped almonds for the 3. chocolate chips. These came out so crisp on the outside chewy on the inside. I baked them for 10 minutes they were perfect. I used my Silpat instead of greaing a pan.I have a keeper here. I gave them as a hostess gift at my Bunco group last night. She loved them. I love how there isn't a huge long list of ingred. just simple and well proportioned. I have always had trouble making cookies but this was foolproof. Enjoy!",
