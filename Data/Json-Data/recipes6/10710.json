Also we make a cinnamon and sugar mixture and generously sprinkle it all over the top of the cake before baking. I usually sprinkle a little more immediately after I take the cake out of the oven. This topping will form a sweet crunchy crusty layer on top. I have also found that the cake tastes better the second day when the topping has a chance to set. I make this for all potlucks and parties that I go to. It doesn't have the greatest presentation but it is delicious.",

I've made it with regular and dark (special) Hershey's cocoa. The dark chocolate makes this recipe POP!!!! Now that I found the recipe again I won't buy cake mixes anymore The finished product is so moist it reminds me of the old Hostess cupcakes when I was a kid back in the 60s. My daughter must eat gluten free products so I used the gluten free flour I found at the farmer's market near my home and it was a total hit with her entire family. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!",

Make sure you mix it well or else it will have floury bits in it. You might want to boil the glaze for a minute or two longer than stated to guarantee it isn't grainy. I needed to bake it for closer to 50 minutes to fully cook it as well. It really needs something like raisins inside or chopped nuts on top though for a little more texture.",
