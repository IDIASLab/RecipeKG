Also browning the chicken under the broiler for about 5 minutes in the end gives it a nice crispness to the skin!! The sauce is WONDERFUL!! Sweet and tangy. We are going to try the same sauce for ribeye and chicken wings!!",

I added a couple shakes of dry mustard and dill weed(maybe 1/2 tsp?)and 1/2 tsp curry paste. Could have added more curry paste as I could not taste it. I cooked in my toaster oven at 375 degrees for one hour and 5 minutes. I put over rice and spooned the cooking juices over the rice. Turned out pretty good but may try to add other ingredients next time. Give it a try.",
