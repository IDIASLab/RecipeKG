I started with 1-1/2 pounds of Hershey bars{the giant ones}and only used about 1-1/4 pounds, one pound will be plenty next time....Definitely score the chocolate before it is completely set.....Great bars for a picnic, the chocolate holds everything together to make a cake finger food. I rated it 4 stars because the expense of buying so much chocolate and not needing but half of it is a real downer in my book. This recipe{adjusted} is most definitely a keeper",

It turned out really good, it definately turned out like a homeade version of the Tastycake brand. I used a 9 x 13in. pan instead, I also didn't measure the peanut butter I just spread it on evenly when the cake was right out of the oven, using Reese's brand peanut butter. I melted 5 hershey bars and that was perfect, and it spread smoothly.  The cake was very moist. I waited untill the cake was room temperature untill I cut it because the chocolate was to hard right out of the fridge. Next time I think I'll use the 10 x 15inch pan to make this more of a bar type dessert. This recipe's a keeper, will definately make again!  Thanks, Rebecca!",

Try 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a dash of salt in the cake mixture.  Also, use oil instead of butter.  The cake part comes out very moist this way.  DO NOT use chocolate chips!!  When it's not Easter time I use melted Hershey's bars.  Also, 2 lbs of chocolate is way to much.  One pound of chocolate is plenty!  Try it the way I have said and you will not be disappointed, I promise!",

Now mind you I never grew up with tandy cakes and had never heard of them before finding this recipe so I have nothing with which to compare nor anything that can say this is authentic or not. That said the cake has a somewhat chewy texture which I found off-putting. I followed the cake recipe exactly as written but used only half the chocolate as others recommended. Also applied the peanut butter when the cake came out of the oven followed immediately by the melted chocolate. Those ingredients combined when spread and they tended to separate from the cake top when cut (yes I did score the topping as suggested.) The flavor is wonderful but just can't get past that somewhat rubbery cake texture. I even made sure not to overbeat after adding the flour. I would not make this recipe again as written however substituting any other conventional yellow cake recipe or even a boxed mix would represent a substantial improvement in my purview. Anything that gets you away from that chewy cake would and allows you to enjoy the chocolate/peanut butter combination while giving you a tender cake as a vehicle should be a winning combination. Good theory not so hot in practice so only 3 stars.",
