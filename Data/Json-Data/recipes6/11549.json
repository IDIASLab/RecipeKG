The only thing I keep the same is the marshmallows strawberries and Jello. Skip all the rest of the ingredients and use a box of Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and prepare it like it says on the box for a 9x13 cake. Pour the prepared batter over the marshmallows then the strawberry mixture on top of the batter and bake like it says on the box. Test it with a toothpick taking care to avoid the marshmallows that rose to the top. Leave it in the pan and cut serving pieces from there.",

I used white whole wheat flour not all purpose. I used only one egg and 1/3 cup egg whites instead of three. I used fat free vanilla yogurt instead of shortening. Of course the milk was fat free and my the jello was the sugar free stuff. Barring tonight I had not had this dessert in over 25 years but even making it a healthier lighter version I still see why it was my favorite. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.",

Then I sprinkled them w/ a little sugar & let them sit in the food processor until thawed. I took Jane's suggestion to make it easier & used a white boxed cake mix. After baking the strawberries were at the bottom of the cake (w/ quite a bit of juice which may put off some people but we liked it) & the marshmallows had risen to the top & melted creating a marshmallowy crust. Yummm! I drizzed a pool of strawberry puree (the kind you use in mixed drinks) onto a plate added the cake & topped it w/ a dollop of whipped cream & a fanned-out strawberry. Thanks for the recipe Maureen!",
