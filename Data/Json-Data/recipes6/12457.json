I agree that they were pretty pale -- don't leave them in the oven longer b/c you think they need more color b/c they'll burn! The cinnamon adds a little color also....I bet nutmeg would work well too. I would make them again. They're very fast and relatively easy.",

I decided to stick to the original recipe and see for myself.\nAs it turned out i had no nuts, nor did i have milk so i omitted them. (I don't understand why milk would be listed anyway as it would thin the dough too much) Also i was using a dark baking sheet so i lowered the temperature to 350F and baked for ten minutes.  They did not go flat as others mentioned, they were crisp and golden on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside.  My whole house smells wonderful too!  This is a keeper!",

We added cinnamon to give a little twist and hide the additional flour needed to keep the dough together. The cookies were very thin and flat quick to burn on the edges and not cook in the middle. They stuck to the pan and the taste was lack-luster. I will not recommend this to someone I considered a friend.",
