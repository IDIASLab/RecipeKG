(make sure to whisk the ingredients in the saucepan to avoid lumps) Brought it to a bubble let it simmer for 5 minutes and then cooled it for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. I decreased the oven temp to 400 degrees for the first 15 of baking and turned it down to 325 for an additional 20 minutes watching the edge of the crust for over browning and then let it cool for 45 minutes. Turned out awesome! The filling was a perfect consistency and had a great flavor! Will make this again!",
