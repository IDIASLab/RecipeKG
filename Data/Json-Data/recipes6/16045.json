The only difference is that she uses regular flour (add 2 t of baking powder) and the sugar is only 3/4 a cup of white sugar if using canned peaches. For fresh soak in an added 3/4 c of white sugar. Also she adds 1/4 t of salt. I use 1 t of vanilla extract and for the milk half the 3/4 c is half and half and the other half is whipping cream. I have always baked it in a an 8x8 dish (CLEAR GLASS for fruits always) and never ended up with a soggy cobbler.",

I made alterations to suit my families taste. for batter: 1 cup of self-rising flour 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup of milk. Hint: Evenly distribute the batter and peaches and juice working from the ouside/in. As even as possibe. Top with cinnomin before baking. I baked at 350 for 1 hour in a 10x10x2in. pyrex dish. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE PEACH COBBLER. Don't roll and weave dough it takes forever and it isn't as good as this recipe. Super Great recipe. 2 thumbs up.",

Instead of one large can of peaches I had 2 smaller ones so I drained one and left the other in the syrup. Baked for about 40 min and it came out wonderfully! I had no problem with sogginess like others said. Update I've made this twice now and I think \"sogginess\" is dependent on baking dish size. First time I did it in a larger dish with absolutely NO sogginess second time in a smaller dish and the middle was all mushy. And a couple of hand fulls of oats over the top of the peaches really added something great to this!",
