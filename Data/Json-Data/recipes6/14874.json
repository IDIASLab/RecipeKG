I used 4 small to medium sized very ripe bananas and it made 11 muffins. The topping was just the right amount. Thanks so much for submitting this ~now~ family favorite and staple!!! Delicious doesn't do these justice! Enjoy! NOTATION: 1-10-04 I wanted to update and tell you all that I made a double batch today and it made 4 mini loaves which baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

To make sure your muffins are nice and moist just add an extra egg. \n\nI made these last night. I used to make Extreme Banana Nut Bread from this site, but this is the one I'll make from now on.\n\nAs I said, a few small adjustments and the muffins are perfect. Besides using butter and an extra egg, I used brown sugar  and omitted the white sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I put a tablespoon of vanilla in the batter and extra cimmamon. I also used a bit more flour for the topping and was very liberal with the cinnamon. It didn't sink into the muffin or get soggy the next day as some people have written.\n\nI bake all the time and these were almost all devoured by the kids and hubby in a matter of minutes. \n\nI'm doubling the recipe today to make teacher gifts. Putting them in festive baskets and adding boxes  of tea as a nice treat for the Christmas break.",

The crumb baked faster than the muffin, so it was much darker and tasted overdone. The crumb wasn't much of an improvement, next time I will make them without the crumb.",
