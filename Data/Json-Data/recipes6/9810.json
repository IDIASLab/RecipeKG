Roasted, the potatoes will end up crispy, buttery, and crusty on the outside, with a light, fluffy interior. It's like taking the best parts of home fries, mashed potatoes, French fries, and potato pancakes, and smashing them all together.",

This is one of my \"go-to\" recipes.  \n\nHere are the two simple KEYS to this recipe turning out well:  \n\n1)  DO NOT overcook your potatoes; they should be cooked until just tender, yet they should still be slightly firm.  If you overcook them, they'll fall apart. You aren't making mashed potatoes!   2)  DO NOT press down (or \"pound\") on the potatoes too heavily.  If the recipe doesn't turn out as expected, your technique was wrong.  Try, try again!",

Since you start the potatoes the day before it does require some advance planning, but well worth it. Instead of seasoning the oil used to brush the potatoes, I added the garlic and herbs to the water for boiling the potatoes (this probably gave them a more subtle flavor).  Then just oiled the cooking pan and brushed the smashed potatoes using avocado oil. When I smashed them some chunks of potato separated so I just smished them back on.
