                "reviewBody": "10.15.19  Eight apples, even small ones, seemed like a lot to fill a dozen muffin cups.  I used 1 large and what I thought were 6 small, and ended up with enough filling left to probably do another three pies. When the apples were cooked, there was a lot of juice in the pan, and I wasn\u2019t sure how much should go into each crust.  I used a slotted spoon to drain some of the juice off the apples and then went back and put about a teaspoon of the sweet juice on top of each apple-filled cup.  Be sure to roll out your pastry crust on a floured surface, otherwise, you\u2019ll not be able to cut 12 pieces, and you don\u2019t want thick crust anyway.  FYI, used my 3-1/2\u201d biscuit cutter and was able to get a dozen out of a single crust.  I should have followed my instinct and sprayed each muffin cup with non-fat cooking spray.  I didn\u2019t, and I had some difficulty getting the little pies out of the cups, some of them just crumbling.  So my recommendation is SPRAY, it can\u2019t do any harm.  I did reduce the amount of cinnamon, but that\u2019s just personal taste.  They taste just like a delicious apple pie, and I like the fact that this gives you portion control.  The only downer for me was getting them out of the pan, otherwise, thumbs up in this house!",
