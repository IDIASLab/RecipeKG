I'm one of those cooks that seldom follows a recipe exactly and I like to leave room for experimentation.  However, for those of you saying that it's not flavorful enough, I might add a few suggestions: I use hillshire farms brand polska kielbasa made with pork, turkey, and beef.  (I don't think the \"all beef\" is as flavorful.)  Also, be sure to use the leaves of the celery...they add a powerful punch of flavor.  Also, don't skimp on the bay leaves or the simmering time.  The lentils don't take that long to cook, but you want to extract the flavor out of the bay leaves, and that's what takes the time.  Also, this is ALWAYS better the next day.  I leave the bay leaves in (probably the reason) and nobody has any trouble eating the leftovers.  (Or, you can just make it a day ahead and then reheat it if you like.)  Anyway, enjoy and use the ingredients that you like.  -Kris",

I used 1 1/2 c Le Puy lentils.  It didn't need salt or pepper.  Also, I added a dash or two of ground thyme.  That's it - yum.  Thanks for the recipe.",

For those who think there's not enough flavor, try using a smokier polska kielbasa -- I happened to have gotten ahold of some wedding kielbasy from www.andysdeli.com and it released a LOT of flavor into the soup.  I rarely give 5 stars to any recipe, but this one is outstanding!",

I simmered mine for about 3 hours and it didn't get mushy or anything. I am a huge salt fan and I really didn't need to add much to my bowl because I really found it quite flavorful. I made no changes to the original recipe except for adding extra carrots and celery. I would even add more next time but I love veggies. I studied abroad in Spain while in college and my host mother made a dish very similar to this. She used Spanish chorizo instead of Kielbasa but the dish was very similar. I've enjoyed cooking with lentils ever since.",

Added remaining ingredients (to include a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes) and simmered for 2 hours.  It was so tasty that it did not even need seasoning with salt and pepper!   I think next time I will add some chopped cabbage or chopped greens (spinach or kale) toward the end.    Can add 1 T vinegar (per earlier suggestion), but it tastes GREAT as is.
