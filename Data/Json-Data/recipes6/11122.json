It really has the consistency of a pudding so you could use it for filling a cake too not only for icing. Unlike other commenters my husband found this to be a bit on the sweet side so I would adjust sugar to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!",

Also... this would make excellent vegan pudding for anyone interested:)",
