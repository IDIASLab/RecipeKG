I served this mousse hours later and it was incredibly smooth, rich, and delicious. I also made a ginger syrup by boiling some slices of ginger with a couple tablespoons of water and white sugar, then straining the ginger. I added this to half the batch to make some regular chocolate mousse and some ginger chocolate mousse (topped with candied ginger). Both came out great.\nThank you!",

I would have preferred this with semi-sweet chocolate but that's a minor criticism and no fault of the recipe. It turned out perfectly without the cream of tartar some reviewers say is a must tho' adding it won't hurt anything. I didn't use the optional kirschwasser but added vanilla instead which actually heightens chocolate flavor. I do have a favorite chocolate mousse recipe however where butter is melted along with the chocolate and I prefer the added richness the butter lends. Still this is a fine recipe. I piped it into chocolate shells and plated it with \"Raspberry Sauce \" also from this site. It was a dessert I'd be proud and confident to serve to anyone.",

The thing with the melted chocolate is that is your get one tiny drop of water in melted chocolate it will clump up (called freezing up) and there isn't a thing you can do about it. Well you can let the chocolate cool and chop it up for cookies but it isn't even real good for that since it crumbles. If your chololate clumps up throw it our and start over.
