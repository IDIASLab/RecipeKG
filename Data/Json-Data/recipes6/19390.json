I added way more than called for because I like my roast to be crusted on the outside, not burned.  I also added garlic salt.  Then I rolled my roast in the seasonings.  No need to add oil to the roast before coating.  I placed the roast in one of those large black roasting pans with a cake rack on the bottom so it would not sit in it's drippings.  No need to cover it with foil.  I cooked mine for 2 hours & 45 minutes at 325 degrees and it did not burn.  I also used a meat thermometer.  Definately double the sauce.  I combined all my ingredients except for the cornstarch and got it warm first.  Then I had a whisk on hand when I added the cornstarch slowly so it wouldn't clump up.  If your sauce gets too thick just add a little more vinegar.  At 2 1/2 hours I took the roast out and drizzled about 1/2 cup of sauce over the roast.  I did not brush it because I didn't want to rub off my seasonings.  I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes and it was perfect.  I will use this sauce with other meals.  It reminded me of the Chinese BBQ sauce on hula beef.",

I also doubled the spices and garlic, mincing the garlic; added a bit of olive oil to make the rub stick to the roast better. I cut slits in the top of the roast and inserted more garlic slivers, and I also put a tent of foil over the roast for the first 2 hours to keep it moist. The sauce has a bit of a teriyaki taste, and no one I serve this to can seem to get enough of it! Awesome! My husband said to make sure I put the recipe in a \"safe place\" for repeated use! :)",

For best results do not substitute for the sage. It makes this recipe. I also use prepared minced garlic out of a jar. Much easier and I think the garlic flavor is better.  Not sure were the 3 hour cooking time comes from, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I bake in a convection oven which goes much faster. Simply use a good meat thermometer and take it out at 150 and rest covered with foil for 15 minutes. I cut into small medallions and serve over jasmine rice. Drizzle some extra sauce over the pork and rice before serving.",

I also jazzed up the rub a bit by adding onion powder and some garlic powder to the mix as well as the fresh garlic and rubbed sage.  We had a 3 lb pork loin and it took about 1 1/2 hours to cook.  I use an instant read themometer and it was reading 160 at the thickest part of the roast when I took it out. Don't forget to brush your glaze on during the last bit of cooking!  We made gravy from the pan drippings by adding about 1 cup water and corn starch as well as adjusting the flavor with salt and pepper.  You will not be disapointed!",

I didn't have a rack to fit so I just cut up an onion in big chunks and placed under the roast. I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki and I also used red wine vinegar instead of the white. I had to stop my husband from devouring the entire roast! **Note from my BH&G Cookbook** Pork cooked with bacon, spinach, tomatoes or onion will sometimes remain pink even when well done so use the meat thermometer to ensure doneness.
