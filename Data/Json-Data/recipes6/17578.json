I did notice the larger pieces of fruit in the jam did migrate to the bottom but the cake itself took on a slightly purple hue from the preserves. One negative for me was that the cake didn't rise in the center. I'm not sure if this was due to the amount of mixing to incorporate all of the ingredients. I did make half the recipe and baked it in an 8\" square pan. It tested done at 40 minutes despite the sunken center. I topped this with Caramel Frosting III.",
