Make sure you use fresh parmesan (I had some asiago) and don't be shy! I also doctored it a bit but really not that much - used half the heavy cream and added an equal volume of milk and splashed a bit of chardonnay some oregano in there towards the end. I did not have arborio rice so I used some thai rice. No worries there. My only complaint is that you have to hover over the pot but the results are great and it was totally worth it.",
