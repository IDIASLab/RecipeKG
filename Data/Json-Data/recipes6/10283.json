After the first time of making it exactly as written (which is great), I've been substiting milk for the water, and using 50/50 white and brown sugar (I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup too). The brown sugar adds more depth of flavor.  I sometimes use a few tablespoons more of sweet potato than called for if there's a little extra in my bowl and it just adds more flavor to the bread (be sure to add a few more minutes bake time if you do this).  I also eliminate the nutmeg since it's overpowers the bread.  Cinnamon is enough spice. My two young kids inhaled this in a few hours - not knowing how good it was for them.  For healthier bakers, you can subsitute applesauce for the oil, but you will need to add about an extra 5-8 min. of baking time. Since this batter is pretty wet, I like to stick to the oil instead of applesauce.  ",

I used a half of the large can and smashed it up. Also instead of using water I used the \"juice\" from the can for extra sweet potato flavor. This definitely cut back on the time aspect. I also decided to omit the nuts. I think I will try this with pumpkin too or maybe 1/2 cup of sweet potato and 1/2 cup of pumpkin? Really moist and really scrumptious!",

I modified it slightly by substituting apple juice (in place of water) and apple sauce (in place of vegetable oil). This didn't give it an overly apple flavor at all, but it kept the bread moist for a week and gave it just a subtle undertone of apple. I also added raisins, instead of pecans. It was a hit with everyone who managed to grab a slice. ",
