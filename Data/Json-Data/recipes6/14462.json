The rolls turned out delicious.\r\nI also tried tossing in about a tsp. of dill, oregano and basil at the beginning, then shaping the rolls a little larger for hamburger buns. Again, the recipe turned out delicious.\r\nNote: For bread machine baking, it is IMPERITIVE to measure the flour carefully, by spooning it into a measuring cup and leveling off the top.  If you scoop the flour from the bag using the measuring cup itself, the flour compacts and the resulting bread will be dry, dense, or worse.",

I make them a little smaller, with up to 18 in a batch.\r\nThat having been said, these really are wonderful, homemade rolls!  \r\n     Another review mentioned freezing the dough, and I have found that it works well.  Here's how: make the dough, then divide it into the rolls, shaped appropriately.  Do not let the dough rise, but freeze the pieces on a flat baking sheet.  After they are frozen, you may store them in a freezer-appropriate container - I end up with two layers, separated by waxed paper.  Freeze, then when it is time to bake a few, take the desired number of rolls, then thaw the dough on full power in the microwave for 50 seconds (this worked well for me, but is more than was recommended by an earlier reviewer).  Let them rise in a warm place for at least 40 minutes, then bake them as the recipe says.  This is a great way to make just a few rolls, as you need them.\r\n\r\nGood luck!",

I also didn't have any powdered milk, so instead of the water, I heated some skim milk and added it. I found these rolls to be superb, and not sweet at all. I think the criticism that the rolls were heavy can be fixed by letting the rolls rise an additional 15 minutes. Also, you needn't bother with the egg white wash! If you want glossy rolls, just rub a little butter on the tops after they come out of the oven. They will wow your family at dinner, with such little effort!",
