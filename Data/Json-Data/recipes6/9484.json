I was very skeptical considering the ingredients but my curiosity got the best of me. I also didn\u2019t think they were easy since the dough is so crumbly and falling apart the whole time. I could only work with it by adding a little water on the second roll out. After tasting the first batch out of the oven, I decided to sprinkle sugar on the second one which helped a little. I will rescue them by putting a dollop of my homemade raspberry jam on them. I\u2019m not including a picture because they look just like those in the recipe. I was wondering if the amount of cheese was wrong in the recipe? Maybe if it was cut in half but not interested enough to give it a second chance.",
