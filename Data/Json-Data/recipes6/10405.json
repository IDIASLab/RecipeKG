I'm in the process of moving and my cookbooks are in storage.  Mom, that perennial source of recipes, was busy making the rest of the meal.  I logged on to Allrecipes.com and found this FABULOUS recipe.\r\n\r\nIt was fast and easy to make, looks beautiful (sorry - no coffee cans, just traditional loaf tins) and tastes great! I had NO left-overs so have made this recipe again on Sunday. Thanks Leigh Paulin for sharing!",
