Another person rated it low because they had trouble getting the mix to dissolve.  First, let me state that this is a great mix.  There are so many variations to suit any taste.  Who really cares if this is cappuccino or not? The real reason we love it is the taste which is wonderful.  And if you have \"mud\" in the bottom of your cup is you either didn't stir, use hot enough water/milk or you used too much mix.  I love this and so does 99.999% of the rest of us.\r\nThank you, Cindy!",
