In using a 9-inch pie pan it did make a shallow pie so next time I would double the raisins and the \"sauce\" mixture. I added vanilla to the mixture just before pouring into the pie pan for additional depth of flavor. I think that adding rum or butter extracts would also create wonderful taste variations. I sprinkled granulated sugar on top of the lattice crust for a crispy sweet touch. This pie goes together fast it uses inexpensive ingredients most of us already have in our pantries and the results are delicious! This pie is perfect for experimentation like adding nuts apples pears etc. I recommend it to anyone that loves fruit pies.",

As if that wasn't good enough I brushed the top crust with cream (milk) and sprinked vanilla sugar over it I think I'm ready for the big leagues!",

(Plain old aluminum pan worked the best.)Definitely double the base mix this is necessary. I also reduced the sugar in the last pie and it met my likes very well I don't like over sweet. I also reduced the raisins by 1/4 cup or more. I also added a cap full of vanilla to the raisin and water pot I much preferred this taste. I would also recommend to brush an egg wash on the pie before cooking it looks much better. Be sure to get into the fine little cracks for an even browning. Also put a cookie sheet under pie to catch any messy droppings! Thank you for posting this as far as taste goes...you can't go wrong with this one. Go ahead and give it a try!
