All of this is just FYI.\n\nWith the second batch I skipped the milk chocolate chips.  They made the first batch very fudgy, and my preference is a cakey brownie.  It is also a great lesson learned to ensure that the cream cheese is definitely softened but also, cutting it into cubes before you blend it is also helpful.  It makes it much smoother and easier to spread.  Finally, I took the reserved cup of batter the second time around and dropped many more much smaller amounts than the tablespoon size the first time.  this just made it easier for me to marbelize it.  :-)\n\nGREAT recipe - love it, my husband loves it, and it's worth the home-made effort!",

I didn't think it tasted very peanut buttery but then again I like a lot of PB taste with my chocolate. The only thing I modified was the cooking time as I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than suggested. The last few dishes I've made have had to be baked longer though so it may just be my oven. These are soo good you won't want to make them if you're trying to watch your diet.",
