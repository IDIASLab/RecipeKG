It had a nuttier taste to it and had a softer undertone whereas the other brand was a bit bitter. It is a nice sponge-cake type texture. I paired it with buttercream that I added matcha powder to (about 1 tbsp powder per 2 cups buttercream) and it was a nice compliment. I didn't bake at 450 though - just 350 for about 20 mins. I would make this again.",

First of all I only used used Splenda No Calorie Sweetener (as opposed to sugar)and for the first two eggs I used eggbeaters. Additionally I had no heavy whipping cream in the house for icing so I used a box of instant pudding mix (I only had cheesecake flavor =/) 1/2 cup brewed green tea 1/2 cup skim milk a few drops of both lemon and lime juice for a little bit of a tart bite. I didn't have powdered green tea either but grated matcha leaves which I mixed in the batter. It gave the dough a distinct green tea aroma and an appearance similar to Pan De Los Muertos (with the anise seeds). I also put a few drops of green food coloring in the frosting and batter for an adorable finish. Even with many substitutions this recipe proved wonderful! Very sweet so the matcha connossieur may be a little disappointed but the lovely aroma while they bake is quite appetizing. =",
