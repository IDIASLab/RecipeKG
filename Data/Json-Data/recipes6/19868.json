I used sweet potato, instead of butternut squash and used a whole can of LITE coconut milk, which reduced the calorie count substantially.  As a result, I also upped the amount of water by adding another 1 to 1 1/2 cups and adjusted the amounts of tomato paste, curry, black pepper, and cayenne. Oh, and lastly, since I needed to use them up, I sauteed some portabello mushrooms and threw them in as the soup cooked.  WOW! So glad I did, since they were a great addition - I'll add them to the ingredient list when I make this again, and I will definitely make this again.  (Did I mention I LOVE this soup?!)  I didn't quite understand the reviewer who claimed they had to halve the cayenne pepper amount and it was still too hot.  Huh?  It only called for a pinch.  Anyway, THANKS a MILLION for this recipe!",

I also used about 3/4 can of coconut milk, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp of cayenne and 1/8 cup of fish sauce in addition to the other ingredients. I didn't have any squash on hand, so I used sweet potatoe instead, which I prefer anyway.  In the end this turned out perfectly. My 8 yo dd asked for seconds and dh requested that we serve it at our next dinner party. I'd call it a hit!!",

If you do not have everything in your pantry, make this soup anyway!  This has a wonderful flavor and I was very apprehensive as I did not have coconut milk.  I substituted Soy Milk and Vegetable broth instead of water.  I also omited fenugreek seasoning as I'm not familiar with this spice.  The soup had a great flavor without any salt.  I added mushrooms as other reviewers suggested and I think the squash adds a lot to this dish.  Will use this recipe often.  Thanks for the post!",

I agree with the review who said RUN (don't walk) to get the ingredients to make this incredible soup! I made a few changes but nothing too drastic. I used potatoes instead of squash fennel seed instead of fenugreek green lentils instead of red (what I had on hand) and pureed about half the soup at the end for more body. Because of this I ended up adding about 2 more cups of veg broth and it was the perfect consistency. I also only used a couple tablespoons of coconut milk because I didn't have low-fat (couldn't justify using so much full-fat!) and it was still very creamy. Absolutely AMAZING lentil soup!! I don't know if I can ever try another because I fear they will all pale in comparison to this. It's top-notch restaurant quality--and SO easy!",

We had it with cubed chicken tonight but I would definitely consider serving it vegan as well. Thanks for the recipe!",
