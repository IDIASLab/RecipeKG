The coffee flavor was a bit strong...next time I will only add one tbp. of instant coffee. I poured this into an 8 by 12 pan & then cut it into small squares. I layered the squares of gelatin in a parfait glass w/ spoonfuls of whipped cream (one dollop is not going to be enough) & drizzled chocolate syrup & caramel syrup over the layers. Wsa refreshingly different...thanks Mardee!",

It almost tasted like sweetened unflavored gelatin. I did use Splenda in place of the sugar but the problem wasn't the sweetness it was the lack of coffee flavor. This well could be remedied by using extra strong coffee or espresso but I doubt I'll be making this one again. Sorry Mardee hate to give a bad review but this just didn't work for us. In all fairness it could just be a personal taste preference issue.",
