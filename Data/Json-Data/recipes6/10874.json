I should have taken it out two minutes sooner. So I felt it was a bit dry but not ruined by any means. I made this for a German gathering and was applauded. They said it was very similar to the Bienenstich's (I guess they differ from bakery to bakery there)in Germany. So over all this is a very good recipe and I will make it again now that I know better....",

Tips - be sure to have the warm water to dissolve the yeast no warmer than a baby's bottle and sprinkle the yeast on top of the water. Mine almost quadrupled in quantity. I also added 1 tsp of sugar to the yeast. Make sure everything that it calls for to be at room temperature is exactly that. My butter was a little too cool but I put it in anyway - that was a mistake. It all curdled. I had to throw it away and start over. This is pretty labor intensive but in the end I was very happy with it. Just follow the directions closely.",

Bienenstich should have a very creamy filling all through out. It really shouldn't be very cake like at all. Almost like a true combo of whipped cream pastry cream and a very light cake. And then of course the almond crust that covers it in a creme brulee style. Mmmm!!! The only reason I'm giving this one star is because despite the fact that it is NOT Bienenstich it actually is a good cake. But since it took me half a day to make I can't say I will keep the recipe.",
