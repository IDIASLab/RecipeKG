I followed recipe exactly (unsual for me) and it turned out terriffic. I baked mine for 9 min. for the perfect soft and chewy cookie.  Of all the cookie recipes I've tried, these taste almost identical to Mrs.Fields coming out of the oven.  It also keeps well the day after. TIP - keep the cookies on the cookie sheet for at least 10 min. if you want the cookies to stay moist and soft longer.  The natural steam that forms on the bottom penetrates the cookie keeping them moist. A bakery secret.",

I also melted the butter before beating it with the sugars; this was a tip from an online \"Chocolate Chip Cookie Hints\" site.  This site also recommended tripling the vanilla.  I used 1 tablespoon of regular vanilla (couldn't find the Mexican variety). The cookies were slightly crispy on top and sides, but wonderfully rich and chewy and flavorful in the middle.  I just baked them today, and they're already almost gone!  Thanks, Nicole!",

If anyone had a problem with these cookies being grey or too soft or too hard, then it was their problem not the recipe. My husband was shocked that I had got the recipe off the internet, as I am a excellent cook and usually invent my own recipes.\r\n\r\nI probably did everything wrong as I have Arthritis Hands, so had a problem stirring, so I used my hands. I also shaped the dough into Balls, with my hands, guessing at the size. The cookies baked down to 36 - 3 \u00bd inch, not too thick and absolutely not too thin wonderful cookies. Baked them on my \u201cREMA\u201d Air Insulated ungreased Cookie Sheets \r\n\r\nClicked on recipe to make 36 cookies instead of the 18 in the original. I did not chill the dough followed your recipe to the letter otherwise. Granddaughter and two Great Grandchildren coming to visit for two weeks. Will be busy so I wanted to get some goodies ready ahead of time. After they cooled I placed them into a box separated each layer with a sheet of parchment paper. Wrapped the whole box in Aluminum Foil, and placed into the freezer. Took one out the next day let it thaw our on a parchment paper. They were perfect, and I now will have 30 beautiful and delicious cookies ready for our family, husband gobbled up three before they hardly cooled, saved three for the next day, I pinched off a piece to taste test for quality as I do not eat sweets, these couldn't be better. Thanks, Dewey & Me",
