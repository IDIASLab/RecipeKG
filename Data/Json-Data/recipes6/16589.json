I also added soy sauce (2T) and used the juice from a can of pineapples as part of the water. I also let this simmer for about 20 minutes before I added the cornstarch. My VERY picky 8 yr old (whom this was made for) thought it was better than the sweet and sour sauce from (insert fast food restaurant name here ):) so it was absolutely a success and will be made again. To reiterate another reviewer - cornstarch must be mixed with a little water/juice before adding to recipes. Also bring it to a full boil after adding to get it to thicken. Thank you!",

I cut the recipe in half (there are just the two of us) and it still made plenty. I also used Splenda instead of sugar and you couldn't tell the difference. The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was because I had to strain the cornstarch lumps out of the sauce. I would definitely recommend mixing the cornstarch with water first before adding. Otherwise the flavor color and consistency of the sauce was awesome. I also used it with the pork patties submitted by Linda on this site and my husband has now requested this combo be a regular in our house. We will never buy store-bought sweet & sour sauce again.

It tasted delicous and was the perfect consistency. I used tomato sauce because I didn't have tomato paste. I also stained out the pineapple because I didn't like the fact of eating the pineapple in the sauce. Great recipe Debbie!",

The sauce was easy and good for your regular order-in Chinese food... and the colour was Fantastic! but if I'm going to cook something from scratch I want a little more Zing!

The sauce bubbled happily away with the juice from the peaches and when it was thick I gently tossed a chopped sauteed onion; 1 lb of cooked diced chicken; a chopped sauteed orange bell pepper and the peaches in. Next time I'll try a fresh tart pineapple.",

Maybe adding 1/3 of the actual paste might help. Some tips with cornstarch because I saw a few people had clumps of it. Cornstarch reacts with hot liquids and balls up. To fix this blend it with cold/cool water (or in some recipes) the vinegar first. This will prevent the balling. Also don't put all 3 tbsp in at once. I usually do one at a time stir it until blended and then do the next one. This will prevent any balling up as well. I think with some modifications this could be a great recipe! The thickness was great and the pineapple chunks are just delicious. This would go great with deep fried pork or chicken!",
