To fix the texture issues others have mentioned, I used either medium or firm tofu (both worked), added a few tbsp flour, and backed WAY longer than specified (almost 50 minutes with medium tofu).  Also decreased the sugar a tad and sometimes add a splash of lemon juice to liven it up a bit. YUM!",
