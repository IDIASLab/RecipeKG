My mom used to make these with little stale flakes that we failed to devour from the huge Charles Chips canisters that were delivered regularly to our house. Yes these cookies are sweet but no sweeter than many other cookies. That said you could cut back either the white or brown sugar by 1/4 cup without affecting the product. Beyond that you risk altering the texture as sugar is a structural element. The chips do not retain their crunch but rather they meld into the cookie leaving behind a chewiness with just the faintest kiss of butterscotch-like flavor. Don't know why it happens - just know that it does and these are always well received with many requests for the recipe. No changes necessary but I used half margarine because I found a stick lurking deep within the bowels of the fridge that I wanted to use up. Simple \"good eats\" type of cookie that you'd find frequently filling cookie jars all over America during the 60s. It was always a delight to find my mom baking these when we got home from school. Nothing better than a couple of these with a tall glass of cold milk. Great comfort food!",
