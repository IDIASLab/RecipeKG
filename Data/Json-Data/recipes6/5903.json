But I confess to never having regular chorizo before. Perfect mix of flavors. I didn't have the roasted tomatoes on hand so I used diced regular and I also used the mozzarella cheese I had on hand.",

I also prepared the 'chorizo' mostly as directed. The only change that I made was to combine an entire can of whole kernel corn (drained) an entire can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and an entire can of the green chiles with the diced tomatoes before simmering with the turkey. The grocery store only had one giant spaghetti squash (5.5lbs). So as another reviewer suggested I turned it into a casserole. I removed the squash from the shell and placed in a lasagna dish. I then placed the chorizo mixture and cheese on top and heated as directed. We loved this and will definitely make it again. Though it's quite time consuming so it'll need to be a weekend",
