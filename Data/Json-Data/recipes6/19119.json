I'd suggest adding the sugar slowly until you reach the level of sweetness that suits your taste rather than simply trusting this recipe.",

Like pancakes or a blueberry dessert and I topped it with my leftover raspberry syrup which I heated up before using. Thanks for the recipe.",

I would recommend you did the same with the raspberries starting at about 2 cups because it can easily get too sweet depending on your batch of berries. After the dumplings cooked off I tossed in a handful of fresh slices strawberries into the syrup for texture. I've even made the syrup ahead of time and finished it off in a crockpot before.",

However the most pertinent advise I would give anyone looking to make this tasty treat is to use a pan at least twice the size you think you need. Dumplings need space especially if you're going to flip them. Cram them all into a too small pot and end up with crumbled dumpling mess and a fantastically purple stove that will be loads of fun to clean up after all that syrup has cooled onto your stovetop. Otherwise these are a great sweet treat.",
