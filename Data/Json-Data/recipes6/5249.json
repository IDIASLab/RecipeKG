I have both eggplant and red pepper in my fridge right now.  The only thing I will do different when I make this recipe will be to roast eggplant in the oven instead of duck frying them. Eggplant soak up a ton of oil. Then they are very greasy and heavy. I dry roast my eggplant slices I the oven, half way to soften, 10 minutes or so at 375, then will follow this recipe as written. Can't wait till tonight!",
