For me, i had no cream of tartar so i used a pinch of salt in my egg whites and let it sit in them before i whipped them.  The salt or cream of tartar helps to denature the egg whites so you get a better, fluffier result! PERFECT!!!",

I beat the egg whites in my kitchenaid until stiff before I began cooking the sugar and water.  I rewhipped for a few seconds before adding the sugar mixture, and whipped while pouring it in.  Don't stop whipping until the frosting becomes glossy/shiny.  The sugar/water mixture never became clear for me, but I poured it in anyway.  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sugar water just to make sure it wouldn't crystallize.  It was delicious with Wacky Cake VIII, for a great layered birthday cake!!",

I have been using a this recipe for over 40 years, and it is a beautiful frosting. It is great on all cakes, and it is soooooooo gooood!!!!!!!!!  The only way to make this fail is: not cooking your sugar mixture long enough. You need to cook it until it spins a 3 to 4 inch thread, and once it starts coiling, do not stir it, and when it has cooked long enough, pour it into the stiffly beaten egg whites (while you are beating them) in a thin steady stream, and then continue to beat the frosting on high until glossy.  TIP: For those who do not know about the 'spin a thread' test, just cook this for 7 minutes. That is the name of the recipe I have used forever....\"Seven Minute Frosting\", and it is exactly like this one. ",

I wasn't sure if the cream of tartar in my cupboard was still good but it worked. As other reviewers have said, this recipe makes plenty of light, fluffy, glossy, easy to spread frosting with a nice marshmallow flavor. With an egg white frosting, the key is to have a clean bowl and beaters without a speck of yolk. I don't yet own a stand mixer so I spent several minutes on it with my hand mixer but the results were worth it. My 8 year old daughter helped with it too. Why bother with store bought icing when you can make your own so easily? I can see lots of variations with this basic recipe too, as others have mentioned, with different extracts and using food color to tint. Fun!  ",

I had them try it before I put it on my son's birthday cake.  They didn't like it at all.  I used a tip from another review and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  They would eat it then.  I actually like it better with the almond extract too.  The 1/4 tsp adds just a hint of almond.  I would add more if you are a big almond fan.  I liked just the hint.",
