I needed a cinnamon cookie recipe, found this one, read the rave reviews and gave it a shot. This is a very delicious cookie. I followed the instructions exactly (and I did also chill the dough as others did for at least 30 minutes) and they turned out perfectly. I used a tablespoon to measure out each cookie and the recipe made exactly one less of 4 dozen cookies! The cinnamon/sugar mixture was just right - not too cinnamon-y and enough to cover all the cookies. I see some have experienced dough too difficult to form into cookies - the key is to not have the butter TOO soft when mixing and definitely chilling before forming. The idea others have had to cut the cinnamon and instead add M&Ms is interesting. The difference is this butter cookie recipe has more brown sugar than white sugar which results in a more molasses-tasting cookie and I think chewier too, just FYI. Overall, I would highly recommend this! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon and I love it.",

I omitted the cinnamon from this recipe and left the rest as is...when the dough was mixed I folded in about a cup and a half of M&Ms. I chilled the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes then rolled it into balls...I wanted my cookies monster sized (for gifts) so this batch made about 18 monster sized cookies. They turned out excellent!! Crispy around the edge soft and chewy in the middle and with a great butter/brown sugar flavor. One caution: don't overbake these! They will be VERY soft in the center when you take them out of the oven but don't be fooled! If the edges are crispy and the cookies are a light golden brown color then they are done....take them off the cookie sheet to cool and the centers will set up to be chewy and wonderful. I am going to try making these again with the cinnamon because I think that would be delicious too!",

The first time I made these cookies I didn't read the directions very carefully and added in the cinnamon sugar into the batter and had to make an extra amount of it.

I wanted a cinnamon cookie with bold cinnamon flavor so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as well as a 10 oz. bag (1-2/3 cup) of cinnamon chips. I don't like flat cookies so I made sure to chill the dough well. Finally I was not comfortable baking these at such a low oven temperature so I baked them at the more conventional temperature of 375 degrees for 8-9 minutes. They spread out to just the right thickness neither too flat nor too thin. What did surprise me is how petite they turned out to be only about 2 inches around. They're buttery cinnamon-y soft yet chewy. Mom and Hubs were eating these before they even cooled and immediately proclaimed them a winner.",

I did alter the recipe by using 2 cups whole wheat flour and the remaining balance using white flour. Chilled the dough for an hour before easily forming them into perfect balls. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough. Used a food processor to cream the sugar and for the final addition of dry ingredients to wet processed until just barely mixed. Yummy yummy. Cake-like consistency with a crispy outside. Cinnamon lovers rejoice. Can't stop eating them. HELP! Evil recipe!",
