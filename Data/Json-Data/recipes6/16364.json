I have found that using butter not only improves the flavor, but it also eliminates the need to butter the crusts altogether. I also don't bother with the pan of water. No need! It is wonderful without the fuss!! The milk, butter, and honey give the bread the depth of flavor that we were looking for. The texture is perfect, and I love that it makes two 9x5 inch loaves. To make wheat bread, I just substitute whole wheat flour for the first 2 cups of bread flour. I can't believe that this recipe isn't more highly rated!!",

Well, I found it a month or two ago in this. This bread has everything I want in a loaf -- the flavor is there, it really is tender and creamy enough you can eat it plain, and yet it holds together well enough for sandwiches and for scooping up gravies and sauces. You really do get the best of all worlds with this recipe. However, I recommend using a bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. I have found that all homemade loaves really benefit in texture immensley. The only other thing I eventually changed was using melted butter instead of shortening -- one time I had run out of shortening and didn't notice until it was too late, so I had to substitute. The butter tastes very, very good in this loaf! The texture isn't exactly the same, but the difference is very minor and I actually like it better. This is a keeper! Thanks, Kristin.",

Not doughy but nice and soft inside with a nice crust. It makes great rolls too! I'm going to add a little more sugar and use it for cinnamon rolls. I'll probably never buy bread from the store again! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!:)",

Don't like shortening used melted butter. 1/2 dough as is; the other I spread cinnamon and butter (forgot the sugar part yikes) before rolling up tight and into the pan. Family loved both and had them straight from the oven with butter and camembert. Made cheese toasts (plain loaf thickly sliced) served with corned beef hash for breakfast... mmm. Quite dense if not for the increased yeast but that's ok too if you like dense bread. Good basic bread with lots of possibilities. Thanks Kristin.",
