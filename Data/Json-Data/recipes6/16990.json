But on baking this for the first time I found it rather a long process since I'm used to the regular cheesecake. I had alot of the batter let over even using a 12\" pan and it cooked like a soufle unless I did something wrong. I wish it had a picture I could go by. And unless you know something about cooking this recipe will be hard for you. This recipe took alot longer than 30 min. to prepare.",
