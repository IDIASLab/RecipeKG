Omitted the oregano, and added cilantro (a key ingredient!) at the end of sauteeing the chicken.  When I sauteed the chicken (strips not cubed), I dumped the marinade and added the last 1/3 of fresh marinade to the chicken as it was nearly done cooking through, which only took a few minutes, not the 20 mins the recipe calls for!  I also added a splash of tequila to the chicken while cooking, per other reviewers; was a nice touch!  Used white corn tortillas (personal fave), and served with grated colby/jack cheese, chopped tomatoes, &  the guacamole on allrecipes.com by Bob Cody, increasing his call for cayenne pepper by at least double.  That gave this dish a bite that I think it needed.  Would have been too bland for us, otherwise, but it was a nice meal, complete with margaritas!",

Things I did differently - used cilantro instead of oregano 1 regular onion instead of 2 green and used the juice of a whole lime instead of 1/2. I cut the chicken in strips instead of cubing it. Used Sargento's 4 Cheese Mexican blend for the cheese. I think you should definitely use fresh lime as opposed to the bottle stuff if you really want the lime flavor to stand out. (And its not overpowering). Also this recipe states that it serves 10 that would be 1 taco per person and who can eat just 1? I think this recipe serves more like 4-5. I love this recipe it is definitely a unique and cheap dish to make for a large group!",

Overall the tacos were really good but in the future I will omit the oregano- it added an Italian flavor as some had mentioned. I doctored this up a bunch and added cilantro extra lime and served with some sliced peppers and onions which I stir-fried in olive oil and cumin (didn't have lettuce). I think cumin or cilantro are definitely more appropriate seasonings rather than the oregano. We served these with salsa. We'll make these again. also- I found that after cutting the recipe in half (to serve 5) my husband and I only had a small dinner. I think the full recipe would probably only be enough for 4 people (not 10).",

I mixed all of the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl while the chicken was sauteing and just dumped it in the skillet and stirred the last 10 minutes of cooking. I used a teaspoon of oil while sauteing the chicken so it wouldn't stick to the skillet and it didn't affect the flavor in anyway. DH and I loved this and so did our 1 yr old! I'm sure my 8 year old would love it too but he was having dinner with his grandparents....too bad he missed out!!!! I used 3 Tbsp of lime juice (bottled kind) and it was delicious!!! I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a nice change from regular tacos! I think I'm going to try these with quesadillas sometimes too! Thanks so Marissa! These were DELICIOUS!!!!!",

Some of the reviewers said their chicken didn't have much flavor but if you double the sauce like I did and cook it for the full time stated in the recipe (so the chicken has a chance to brown to a nice caramel color) then it has plenty of flavor.
