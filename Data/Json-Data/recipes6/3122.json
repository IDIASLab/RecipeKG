I made them put them on a foil-lined pan then covered them. Just before we ate I covered them in BBQ sauce and put them under the broiler until the sauce was bubbling. We didn't eat until much later so they were just a little bit dry by then. Next time I may pressure them for a couple less minutes but they could have been dry because they sat for so long.
