I doubled the powdered sugar and used 1/2 tsp. clear vanilla and 2 1/2 Tbsp. milk for the glaze. My daughter also liked them.

I don't have apple pie spice so I added a combination of allspice cinnamon ginger and nutmeg (basically homemade apple pie spice minus cardamom). Only change I'll make next time is using baking powder instead of baking soda so it won't rise as much (it would be less cakey this way). A lot of reviews say it doesn't need the glaze but I think it added the perfect touch. Paired with some ice cream and coffee it was a great end to a nice fall day!",

I was a little leery of just throwing all the ingredients in together and beating as directed but there was no problem. Nice as it makes for easier cleanup. I followed this recipe but used half whole wheat flour and pumpkin butter along with pumpkin pie spice. I also left out the raisins. These truly don't need the glaze but they are much prettier with it so I just drizzled it on lightly. Thank you for sharing a great little recipe!",
