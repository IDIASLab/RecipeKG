        "description": "I developed this recipe over 10 years ago because I was tired of all the sugary squash soups out there with spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. This recipe combines the sweetness of the squash with the earthy complexity of parsnips and carrots. The measurements are approximate, since I go by look, feel, and taste. The proportions here make a large batch. It could be halved if you desire, but where's the fun in that?! Add a little fresh chopped herbs, like parsley or basil, if you like. Serve hot and gently drizzle a little chile-infused olive oil and balsamic fig vinegar over the top of each bowl. (The fig makes it like syrup. You can also prepare a simple balsamic reduction instead).",
