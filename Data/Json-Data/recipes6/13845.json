As recommended by others, I blanch the broccoli florets for about 30 seconds, plunge into ice water until cooled, then drain and dry.  The broccoli stays a  gorgeous green and is easier to eat.  I usually omit the raisins, but have them on the side for sprinkling.  Also, I usually make 1 1/2 times the dressing.  Typically, I mix the salad together with about 1/3 of the dressing and leave covered tightly in the fridge overnight or for several hours-the pasta soaks up the dressing. About 30-60 minutes before serving, I add the rest of the dressing.  This salad is always a hit!",

Blanch brocolli peices in almost boiling water for about 1 minute, scoop out and put in ice water to shock and produce a beautiful green 2.) toast sunflower seeds 3.) if you use frozen tortelinni, cook for only 2-3 minutes in not-quite-boiling water- they will be done enough, any longer and they will be mushy and fall apart 4.) make 4 times the dressing called for, use a combo of miricle whip and mayo and only 1/2 cup sugar.  Lastly, mix pasta, broccoli, craisins and 2/3 of the dressing the day before and let it marinate!  Top with the rest of the dressing, seeds and bacon (i didn't use onion) right before serving.

(I may have overcooked it)  I used tri-colored tortellini and craisins for a more festive look, used just less than 1/4 cup sugar and doubled the rest of the dressing ingredients.  I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds.  I also followed the suggestion to mix salad with 1/3 of dressing and leave covered in fridge overnight.  I added the rest of the dressing an hour before serving.  Oh - and I do wish I would have chopped the onions more finely.  Resulting taste was a bit more \"oniony\" than intended.  Overall, it turned out wonderfully!  I was concerned that the flavors wouldn't blend well, but this was great together!",

Three catering trays were devoured!!! The only adjustments I made were as follows...I reduced the sugar, and sugared 'to taste'. I omitted the raisins, as most people do not like them, and replaced them with cashews(WOW!). I was able to find tri-colored frozen tortellini at a wholesale club and it really added to the presentation. I steamed my broccoli as well. Also, ***VERY IMPORTANT TO DO...DOUBLE THE DRESSING*** I added half the night before and the rest before serving. My advice is not to skip this very important step, it makes all the difference in the world. Folks, it doesn't get much better than this!!!!!!!",

For the dressing I used 1 1/2 cups mayo 6 T sugar and 1 T Cider Vinegar. I reserved some of the dressing to toss just before serving since pastas absorb a lot of dressing as they sit in the frig. I also save some bacon to sprinkle on top just before serving. Like many others I did blanch the broccoli. Very tasty recipe!!",
