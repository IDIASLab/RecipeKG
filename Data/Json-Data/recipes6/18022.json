The important thing to note is that it must be refrigerated overnight because thickening occurs as it gets COLD, not as it cools in the oven to room temperature.  I think the first reviewer did NOT follow the instructions on cooling properly. You must make this recipe the day before it is to be served or it will not be firm enough to cut properly.\n\nIt also tastes good and looks beautiful without the blueberry topping- substitute drizzled caramel topping as used in the crust.",

When this cheesecake cooled it was runny and undone. (in fact I had left it in the oven for an additional 5 min. cooking time before I turned off the oven and let it cool in there) I felt like it was a waste of ingredients and it was a dessert for company so it was disappointing to cut into it and have the consistancy of pudding. Due to all the egg yolk and eggs in it I scraped off the whip creme and returned it to the oven and sent company home without dessert. For cheesecake it had the appearance of being done-but was runny on the inside and the crumbs didn't hold together like a cheesecake crust should-it was like sand. Too much work-too expensive-too bad! I cannot think of anything I did wrong on this recipe.",

I found that I had to double the clarified butter to get the crust to a consistency that I could press it into the pan - but it was great. I think I will double the sauce next time - I ran out and had to use pie filling - the sauce is truly worth it. It was quite big so I cut it into slices and froze it - it thawed beautifully.

This is my first time baking a whole cheesecake and i couldn't be more pleased. i baked it for my sister's birthday celebration and all her friends loved it and complimented me profusely...(one even cliamed he was going to have a food orgasm haha)I followed the recipe exactly (except I did not have a food processor so I used my blender for the crust) but found that I had to bake it for an extra 20 minutes or so at 300 degrees then turned off oven and left cake inside to let it cool for about half an hour before opening the door a crack. I let it sit like that for approximately another hour then took it out and let it sit on the counter for a bit to finish cooling. I did not have time to refrigerate it overnight but the few hours it had in the fridge was enough. I could not believe it: no cracks (even though I was lazy and did not use a water bath) and no sinking! I smothered some blueberry topping around the border drizzled on melted white chocolate chips wrote on it with icing and garnished it with 16 blueberries that I saved it looked really nice and tasted even better. Oh yeah and I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust yum! My friends and I are both raving over this cheesecake look how long this comment is! Excellent recipe I only wish I could give more than 5 stars! I will definitely be using this recipe again and again! THanks Scott for a great recipe!",
