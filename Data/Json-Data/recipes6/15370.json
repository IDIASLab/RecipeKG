Her recipe is exactly the same EXCEPT she beat the leftover egg white until frothy, spread that froth over the top layer of crescent dough, and then mixed 1/2 cup chopped nuts with 1/4 cup sugar and sprinkled that on top.  The nuts really addto this (and also help to hide the seams if your dough doesn't cover completely as some reviewers stated).  I made them yesterday for a PTO meeting and got several requests for the recipe (with the nuts).  Great recipe!",

I had 1 package of Pillsbury French Croissants and 3/4 package of light cream cheese and figured I could adapt this recipe to the ingredients I had. It turned out great. I used an 8x8\" square pan and trimmed the dough slightly to fit the pan. I used 1/2 an egg yolk and filled a half cup measuring cup to about 3/4 of the way with sugar. It was perfect. I wouldn't want the cream cheese layer to be any thicker. It took about 25 minutes to bake. They definitely tasted better once they cooled. I tried them about 2 hours after making them and they were still a little warm and the cream cheese didn't taste as good like that, so I refrigerated them overnight, and then took them out about an hour before serving. Fabulous. I can't wait to make them again so I can experiment by adding things like cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese layer and before the top dough layer. YUMMY.",

But the most sensational change I made was baking it in my 9x13 deep stoneware baker. It turned it into something totally delicious! Bake for an additional 10 min. the top will be slightly jiggly but it is done. The cream cheese is molten inside and will serve as a sauce for the pastry crust. Yummy!",
