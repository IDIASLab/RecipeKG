I couldn't possibly count. This is a very good recipe. I altered it a bit... here are my changes:\n3/4 Butter, 1/2 White sugar, 3/4 lightly packed brown sugar, 1 Tbsp Vanilla and 2-1/2 Cups flour.\nI baked the cookies in a 350 oven for about 9-11 minutes.. depending on the size. REMEMBER.. if your cookies are flattening.. they need more flour.\nWhenever I make cookies.. I make 4 on a pan for the first bake time.. that way I can adjust the recipe if needed! Enjoy and thanks for the recipe!\nLala",

If it's badly yellowed on the outside don't use it or your dough will taste bad. 2)The best tasting white chocolate chips contain cocoa butter and are really hard to find. 3)Cheap blenders overheat easily and metal silverware spoons bend easily. 4)You don't need to flatten the dough valls to get them to bake evenly -- if you roll the dough into balls or drop as rounded shapes the cookies come out puffier and flatten less. 5)Undercooked cookies are as bad as overcooked cookies. Wait until you see the tops just starting to brown before taking the sheet out of the oven (9.5 minutes for me!). 6)Air bake non-stick cookie sheets are worth the money - convenient and no burnt cookie bottoms.",
