The only change I made was I used a 9x13 pan and it worked fine. The cake is moist and flavorful and the glaze is awesome!!! I was just looking for a cake to use up some apples and boy was I surprised when it turned out soooo good. I have made this cake about 6 times now and I have noticed that using cake flour makes it lighter and not as dense and different types of apples also make a difference. I also like to use about 1/2 C applesauce and 3/4 oil for a healthier version. When I prepare the glaze I bring it to a boil slowly and let it cook just a little maybe a minute then I poke a few holes in the warm cake before pouring the glaze over it.",

I cooked it in a bundt pan and it looked picture perfect. Everyone loved it and I particularly loved the added flavor and texture of the coconut. It was also more moist than the apple bread that I made the week before from another recipe on here. The glaze wasn't what I expected but tasted sweet. My wife was expecting a glaze that was more white such as one made from confectioners sugar.",
