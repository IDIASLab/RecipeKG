But all that peeling, deboning, cutting, and marinating is all worth it. I got the savory sweet flavors that bulgogi marinades are known for but made even better with the tender and juicy thighs that were soaked overnight. Serve this with a bunch of Boston/Bibb lettuce, garnished with scallion strips.",

I was lazy and tossed it with partially cooked carrots and put them in a baking dish. The flavors were excellent. I was looking for something like hoisin sauce. I could have increased the sugar but decided to enjoy it as it was. It also looked very professionally plated if i do say so myself. I was looking forward to seconds but my large dog snitched my plate off of the table. I will definately make it again and share it.",
