So I added an extra 1/2 cup of wheat flour 1/4 cup of wheat bran 1 1/4 cups of rolled oats 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and baking powder and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I dropped them by the tablespoon onto a parchment paper cookie sheet. I then baked them for appx 20 min. It made 42 cookies. They came out very moist. So I put them into our dehydrator and dryed them. They made the best granola cookie. I will be making these again and again. There great for a quick breakfast or to take alone while traveling and they are high in fiber.",
