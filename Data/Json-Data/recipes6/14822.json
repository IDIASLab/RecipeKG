If you do use this recipie sub the white surgar for confectioners and add a 1/4 more.  half the fatty shorting or just use double butter flavored margarine.  Too much to subsitute just take a few moments and find another. Tastes like wax.",

This is old fashion butter cream frosting and is not as sweet as recipes using powdered sugar. My mom used all butter an no shortening,which gives it a richer taste. You do need to beat a long time to avoid a gritty texture from the granulated sugar. It is somewhat lighter than most frostings, but still holds on to the cake while frosting. I would refrigerate after frosting because of the milk and bring out 30 minutes before serving. I just made this using Eggnog in place of milk for an eggnog cake I made.",

They key is room temp ingredients and whipping for 15 minutes. ADDING EXTRA SUGAR will make it gritty. This also works well with a few tablespoons of cocoa or peanut butter to vary the flavors. This is a high success frosting compared to gritty runny powdered sugar frosting that makes a mess and is sensitive to temperature. KUDOS!",
