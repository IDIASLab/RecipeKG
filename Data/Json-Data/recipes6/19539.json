For the first few days of the life of this cake it was quite unexceptional and bland. My only diversion from the recipe was instead of adding plain chocolate pieces I had added chocolate with chile peppers because I wanted something with deep ethnic flavour. I topped the cake with marscapone cheese papaya's and strawberries. I couldn't even taste chocolate the first day I baked it. So I put it away and then a week later heated it up again and it was one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had! I recommend this recipe completely if you have the patience to age the cake for the fine flavors to come out.",
