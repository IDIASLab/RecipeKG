I think next time I would add some garlic powder (or minced garlic and cook it with the onion and pepper) and maybe some pepper jack cheese too. The primary flavor of this is cumin, so if you're not a fan, you might want to lessen it a bit--but we very much enjoyed it as-is. Topped it with salsa and fresh oregano and it was delicious!
