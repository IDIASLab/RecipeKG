It said to add 2 cups of flour, I put 4 and it still wasn't enough! Whoever came up with this recipe seriously can't cook. I think that this reciped should b removed from this website. The cookies ended up everywhere. I could not even eat one cookies because i couldnt get it near my mouth without it falling to the floor in pieces! It was horrible.
