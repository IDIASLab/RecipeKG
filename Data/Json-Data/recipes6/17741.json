I will definitely be making these again!....I just made these for a second time but decided to try to make them moister. They came out even better! Not quite chewy but definitely very moist. Here are the changes: use less than half of the butter to melt with the chocolate. Use the remaining butter softened to cream w/ the sugar. Add eggs and then chocolate mixture with liquor. Then add the remaining ingredients...I decreased the flour to 1 1/2 Cups.",
