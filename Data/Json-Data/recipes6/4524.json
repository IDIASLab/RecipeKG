A former roommate introduced me to some basics with tofu, and over the past few years, I've settled on this ratio of spices and other breading ingredients. The crust on the tofu sticks is tasty and the texture is really wonderful. Serve with a relish or a dip of some sort (I love this with plain yogurt mixed with eggplant brinjal). I usually make this with a cumin-scented rice dish and a garlicky broccoli side.",

I did make a couple of changes according to what i had on hand though, but it still came out brilliantly. i'm eating while i type!\ni \"made\" the vegetable broth by crumbling a boullion cube in about a cup of water, and let the tofu sit soak while i was mixing the flour. I never measure more accurately than just eyeballing when I cook, but I used about a handful of brown flour (rather than white), and added maybe a tbsp of a curry mix spice (cumin, curry powder, garlic, mustard powder), a large pinch of chili powder, a large pinch of dill, and some fresh ground pepper. i skipped the yeast because i didn't have any (although i am a fan of that stuff). i also didn't add any salt, as boullion cubes are usually loaded with salt already.\ni used just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a small frying pan and fried until crispy. yum! and it only took me about 10 minutes in all too!",

If you want the tofu a little more dense (than even the extra firm) cut it up marinade in the veg broth and stick it in the freezer for a while. You can leave it there for at least a couple weeks and it becomes more dense. (Freeze in a single layer until frozen) This goes for any tofu recipe especially those that go on the grill!",

Wrapped in a dish towel I am able to squeeze out a fair amount of liquid without having to place a heavy object on it like I have seen suggested. I did make the mistake of buying firm instead of extra firm tofu but it did not cause any problems. These turned out great crunchy and tasty on the outside with a chicken like texture on the inside.

                "reviewBody": "Not a typical tofu eater. Tried this recipe because we are trying to incorporate less meat and more protein foods into our diet. Plus my youngest is allergic to pretty much everything. I altered a little with rice flour & used cornstarch. no cayenne pepper. They came out crispy and needing a little salt but good. I will probably use a soy sauce/ lemon mixture to dip them into.",
