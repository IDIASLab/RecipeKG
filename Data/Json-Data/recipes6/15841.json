I am a bartender, and have tried many different versions of this recipe, and this is the one I will stick to!\nI would like to add one thing that I do not believe was mentioned in the directions. If you are bottling this for shooters, I suggest straining the finished product...I do so using a NEW pair of womens hose, this makes for a lot less sediments and your finished product is a lot less cloudy!\nAlso This is a great idea for Holiday gifts, we make up a batch of this,(with this recipe you will get about 10 bottles) put on homeade lables and finish with with a red bow tied around the neck of the bottle and pass them out to friends....they love it!",
