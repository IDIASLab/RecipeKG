The oil did produce a moist cake however, this recipe has some problems. First of all, this is a recipe that produces TWO 9 inch round pans. If I had used all that batter for an 8 inch pan I would have had a major mess. Secondly, I added 2 additional tablespoons of peanut butter for more peanut flavor. I also decreased the vanilla and only used 2 teaspoons. The batter was incredibly thin so I also added another 1/2 cup flour. I was pleased with the final product but it certainly took innovation.",

I used some chocolate chips also & baked in a bundt pan. I did do a peanut butter glaze and melty chocolate for some color & added flavor - without the glaze this cake would have been inedible. I was very disappointed as it was a birthday cake for one of my best friends - and now I owe him another.",
