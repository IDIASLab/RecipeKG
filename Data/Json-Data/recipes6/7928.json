It was something of a cross between a hush puppy and a piece of fried chicken (not dry but not juicy either, plenty of heft in the chew, which I didn't expect). Varying the seasonings would give you a lot of options for flavors - last night hubby & I discussed adding Old Bay for a fake seafood flavor! This was a lot of fun, and the kids loved it.",
