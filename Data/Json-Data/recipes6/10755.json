It's nice to have something I can make from scratch, without additives, and not have to rely on something that came out of a box. My whole family loves this cake...even plain with nothing on it...of course, a few strawberries make it even better.\r\nAfter reading the other reviews, I have some suggestions:\r\n1. Make sure all utinsels used are grease free - any grease can cause your cake to fall.\r\n2. Line bottom of cake pan with wax paper. Before taking cake out of pan, slip a knife around the outside and inside of pan...your cake will come out perfectly. Once out, take the wax paper off the top of cake.\r\n3. If you are seperating your own egg white, remember ANY yoke in the egg white will cause your cake to fall.\r\nHappy eating!",

I also found a GREAT trick for separating eggs.... USE A FUNNEL!!! The whites slip right out and the yokes are kept in the funnel! Just be sure to separate over a separate bowl so that if a yoke does slip through it won't spoil the whole bunch. Also the almond extract is a GREAT addition to this cake.",

                "reviewBody": "This was good, I ate 3 pieces! My family really liked it too. The only thing I changed was that I didn't whip the egg whites to stiff peaks. When you make angel food, you're not supposed to whip them to very stiff peaks because that expands the walls of the bubbles to their full capacity, so then they won't rise anymore in the oven. I whipped mine to a good thick foam, then added the cream of tartar, whipped them to soft peaks, added the extracts, then whipped just enough to incorporate them. My batter was POURABLE, I didn't have to scoop it into the pan. Also, when you mix the flour mixture in, gently fold it in with a spatula, or else you'll pop the tiny bubbles and it will deflate. I cooled my cake in the pan on the counter, no bottle or funnel, just balance... and it was fine (make sure you cool it completely!!!). I did use a tube pan with a removable bottom, I also highly recommend that. I served up the slices with macerated strawberry slices and sweetened whipped cream.",
