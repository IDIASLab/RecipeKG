So many people down rate a recipe and post all of the alterations they made and don't even try the recipe as written and the recipe it's self gets a lower grade than it deserves! I made this recipe just as written and it was absolutely wonderful!! Delicious, perfectly balanced flavors and perhaps the idea of baking the chicken is to reduce the fat from pan cooking in oils. The idea of cooking the pasta in the chicken broth with the seasons and lemon juice is brilliant because it really holds in the flavor! Wonderful, We love it!! Not to be petty, but it's really rediculous how so many discredit a recipe they don't even truly try because they make all of the changes, they're only rating their own recipes. Kudos for sharing this recipe, it's great!! Five stars from my family.",

I cubed it and seasoned it with lemon juice, garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl. Then saut\u00e9ed the chicken in a little bit of oil. It was much quicker than baking it. After the pasta was ready, I made sure that not ALL of the broth had cooked into the pasta. The little bit of broth mixed nicely into the cream when I added it to the pasta. I made sure to let the pasta mix with the chicken a little while before adding the cream. I didn't want to add the cream when the pasta was too hot for fear of curdling. Otherwise this was a fantastic meal. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend believes he could eat it EVERYDAY. I have to agree with him. It will be on the menu at least every week.",

First, i cubed 3 b/s chicken breasts and put them in a bowl and i poured about 1/4 cup of lemon juice over it, about a spoonful of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of lime juice, and about 1 tablespoon of lemon-pepper seasoning and i browned it in a skillet over med heat. After I finished the chicken, i transferred it to a bowl. In the same skillet, i cooked chopped mushrooms & red bell pepper in it. then put the chicken back in w/ the vegs. I followed directions for the pasta, I used multi colored spiral pasta. After the pasta was done, i threw it in w/ the chicken mixture and poured about 1/2 to 1 cup of the broth in and added 1/3 cup of milk & 1 tablespoon of butter (in subitute for the cream). It was DELICIOUS! Next time, I'll use cream to make it more \"creamy\" but this dish was very light and delicious. the lemony taste was subtle but strong enough. I love it. It's a keeper!",

Instead of seasoning the breasts I just put all the ingredients into the sauce. I also added some white wine and a little lemon pepper. Oh ya I cut the chicken broth down to only 1 can as I wanted a really creamy sauce. I then put the whole uncooked chicken breasts into a casserole dish and I poured the sauce over them. I cooked them at 350 for about 25 mins and then served it over seasoned linguini. We had Steamed Zucchini (from this site) and Garlic Bread Fantastique (also from this site) with it and it went perfectly. Very tasty will make again. Thanx alot for this great recipe!!!",

We only cooked the pasta for about 10 minutes and made sure to leave a bit of broth in the pan to mix with the cream. We also lightly sauteed mushrooms and asparagus spears and added those at the end. Served with a salad this is good but required some alteration.",
