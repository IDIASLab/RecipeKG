I used a plastic spoon to scrape out each portion before balling up and rolling into the cinnamon/sugar coating.  It was a surprisingly quick process.  The first time I made these I just dipped the top of the dough into the cinnamon/sugar spice coating - a quicker process yet, but rolling the entire ball into the coating gives the cookie better taste (well worth the trouble).   Just tried this recipe again, but I  only made half the batch.  For this  I still used butter instead of shortening.   I  added half tsp. vanilla and only half tsp.  cream of tartar.  Using a plastic melon baller I scooped up ~ tbsp. of dough, rolled in cin/sug mixture, then slightly flattened on cookie sheet (using bottom of a custard bowl).  I baked @ 375F for 9 minutes (as per another reviewer's direction).    The cookies baked up in the classic form; slightly flattened with the rough, crackly texture.  I got 3 dozen beautifully goldened, cinnamon-speckled cookies.  I think that adding less cream of tartar got the dough to flatten out more (instead of the \"dough ball\" look) while baking.",
