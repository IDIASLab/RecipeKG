I hate to write a bad review but I think this is warranted to help prevent others from trying this waste of time recipe out. I grew up in Pennsylvania and have fond memories of our family making milk pies. This pie will not even come close to setting so your finished pie will be a liquid pie. 1 cup of molasses is at least 3/4 cup too much! To top it off the thing boiled over creating a huge molasses mess in my oven. My saving grace was that I found another milk pie recipe out on the web that I made along with this one that turned out good. I'm going to consult with some family members about milk pies next time I have a go at them.",

I have to say there is not enough flour should be more like 3&1/2 Tbls and I use 1 cup of sugar. Cream plus milk in a 1/3 ratio. It helps to warm the cream slightly prior to adding. Waaay too much molasses 1/4 cup at most. Make sure to mix dry ingredients in pie shell prior to adding milk and cream. (Smidge of vanilla extract doesn t hurt here) After you add liquid gently stir to incorporate the dry and distribute through the pie filling. I think this helps it set better. I also add butter piece the size of a walnut maybe 1 tbls. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake at 400 for 15 min then reduce heat to 350 and bake another 45-50 min. Let the pie cool in the hot oven. It will set sometimes a bit runny but this is what makes it soooo good. My son will eat the whole pie if I let him. Good old PA Dutch pie. Side note can also use chocolate milk when making.",
