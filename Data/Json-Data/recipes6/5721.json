I did have to add 2 cups of beef broth because the barley soaked up the liquid even though it cooked for less time then required. ( 6 and 1/2 hours.)  We also tried the spicy version and it was a bit too spicy for everyone in my family.  I would definitely make the stew again. Next time, I will add 2 cups of beef broth and use just the tomatoes with the garlic.",

This was great to leave in the crockpot all day Sunday while we worked outside and then come back in to a warm meal.  I served it with Cheddar Cheese Muffins from this site.
