Made the following changes after reading the reviews... used 2 cup water the entire pkg. of cake mix; reduced the flour to 4 cups and increased the vanilla extract to 2 tsps just for added flavor. Recipe turned out great! My family was in awe since this was my very first batch of cinnamon rolls to ever bake that didn't come from a can! I also used Janni's recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II to top these just because we love cream cheese! Thanks again for a great recipe this is definitely a keeper!",

The frosting is by far the best I've ever tasted; quite sweet but delicious. My only complaint was that there wasn't a ton of cinnamon flavour and no drippy gooey cinnamon-sugar concoction oozing from the rolls (my favourite part!). I'll definitely use the recipe for the dough and for the icing but will probably tweak the cinnamon-sugar mixture by using about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of brown sugar in place of the white and increasing the cinnamon significantly as well. Beyond that these were excellent! Thanks Jamie.",
