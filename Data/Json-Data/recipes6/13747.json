But it was a friends family recipe I promised NOT to give out. This is easy and awsome. Everyone will be in aw over it. Simple recipe but so you know roll needs to cool at LEAST two hours in the fridge to firm up. It can also cool overnight just so you know. Wrap it in tin foil and it keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months and it is still just as yummy as it was fresh. I ship to my brother in New Jersey from California EVERY YEAR!",

Otherwise, no other changes were made to the ingredients.  The cake needs to be baked in a 15\"x10\" jelly roll pan so that it can be rolled thinly and with minimal cracking.  Used cooking spray to coat the pan then added parchment paper and coated it with shortening and flour.  Baked it for 15 min. until the toothpick came out clean.  Use a lot of confectioners sugar!  Sprinkle the towel liberally with the sugar before inverting the cake onto the towel and sprinkle the cake, too before rolling it.  Roll the towel into the cake and let it sit on a wire rack for 30 min. When it's time to add  the cream cheese mixture, it  won't melt since it'll be cool enough.  Wrap the roll in foil when you're done rolling it again and place it in the refrigerator for a few hours so that it can set up.  Delicious!  Thanks.",

Actually I thought it was going to be ok...rolled in the towel added confectioners' sugar on the towel per suggestions and a friend who made one. Seemed to roll fine. Let cool completely after rolling. Spread filling on it and then attempted to roll. Totally cracked. So bummed. Haven't tasted yet but I am sure it tastes good the filling was yum and how could you go wrong with a cup of sugar. Presentation terrible.:( Not sure if I will attempt again; lot of work for a big disappointment but maybe its just me and these are my 2 cents. Thanks anyways.",
