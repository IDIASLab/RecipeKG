Since I like things a bit sweeter I used 1/4 cup of sugar. I froze my butter and used a cheese grater to \"grate\" it in to the flour mixture. I also used raisins instead of currants. Buttermilk is great for baking as it always makes things very moist. I used a whole cup and had no trouble with kneading. I formed the dough into a 7 inch round and placed it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I did an egg wash over top and it baked up nice and brown. This is such a simple recipe that produces such great results. I think you could simplify it even more and just use 2 cups of self-rising flour along with the sugar butter buttermilk and raisins....",

I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I substituted skim milk with a tbsp of vinegar mixed in. I soaked the currants in some warm water before mixing them in. Also I carelessly dumped the whole cup of milk in rather than adding it until the dough was soft. It made for a wet sticky dough that I was unable to knead but I shaped it and place it in an oiled cake pan. The result was a lovely cakey loaf that my husband raved over. We served it with butter at dinner and then we had it for breakfast this morning with butter and jam. Delicious and easy (not to mention forgiving). This recipe is a definite keeper.",
