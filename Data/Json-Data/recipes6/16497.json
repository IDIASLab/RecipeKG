Once we got over that part it went together without a problem. There's no getting around the 4 hours of freezer time (we tried but it was only stiff pudding). BUT once solid this is lime goodness of a very high order! It's super creamy not overtly lime but a good balance and marries with the graham cracker crust like it was made in heaven. Oh for those not in the know like we were the cream of tartar is chemically necessary (we looked it up). Good recipe. Enjoy!",

I knew I wanted a frozen recipe not a custard-y key lime pie and this recipe was perfect! I followed it as exactly as possible...I didn't have key limes so I squeezed the juice from 3 regular limes and used that instead (I read that key limes are more tart so I used extra lime juice approx. 1/2 cup). Combined with the no-bake graham cracker crust recipe from this site this pie was a delicious success!",
