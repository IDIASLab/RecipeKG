I also doubled the garlic, used low sodium soysauce and added red pepper flakes for a kick. Let it simmer for about 5-10 mins and you got yourself an asian inspired meal!",

Those additions make this dish out-of-this-world!!",

The first time I made this I followed the recipe (except that I STEAMED the asparagus) The next time I tweaked it quite a bit and it turned out great -- plus I like to make things easier. I added 1 Tbsp butter to the olive oil added minced garlic then the fresh asparagus trimmed and cut (not pre-cooked) then took a shortcut and added 1/3c of Kikoman Roasted Garlic Teryaki sauce threw in the shrimp & covered for a couple minutes until they turned pink. Sprinkled cornstarch right into the liquid in the pan for a sauce. Then making it even easier popped in Uncle Ben's Roasted Garlic Wild Rice pouch in the microwave and Voila!",
