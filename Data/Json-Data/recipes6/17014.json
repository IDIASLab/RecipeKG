I used chopped dried apricots and dried currants instead of raisins, and I also coarsely chopped the chocolate chips (I didn't have any miniature ones to use which I prefer over the reg size).  But it was the basic recipe for the dough that makes these cookies.  Mine turned out outstanding and I'm making another batch right away to ship to my daughter away at college.\r\nThank you so much for posting this!!!",

I did add some spice as another reviewer did.  At first I was disappointed because they turned out flat. But! they were delicious. So the next batch I did not grease the sheet, and this time they turned out perfect, nice cookies.  So..if your pan doesn't stick bad, I wouldn't grease it.  Unless you like the flat style. ;)  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I like this recipe because it makes a basic oatmeal dough to which you can add whatever you'd like.  One time I made oatmeal raisin cookies, the next time I used only chocolate chips and walnuts.  I've also frozen half of the dough (without any of the raisins, chips, etc.) and just took it out of the freezer, let it thaw, added what I want to it and baked for about 10-12 minutes.  The possibilities are endless with this dough.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!",
