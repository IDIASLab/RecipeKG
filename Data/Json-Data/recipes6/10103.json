I used half the butter and i baked it in the oven first for 35 min on 375 degrees turning it over half way through and then i broiled it for 5 min on each side. It turned out perfect. I would recommend before you put it in the broiler put it onto a flat baking tray on top of foil without the juices just place the chicken on it because that is what causes the smoke to fill the house.",

I must say, I usually broil either boneless, SKINLESS theighs or just a whole split chicken. I don't know why it ended up saying \"with skin\".  The theighs are much less fatty if they're skinned...but the whole split chicken is just beautiful when it's presented on a serving platter garnished with more parsley. Again, thank you & enjoy!",
