I made half the batch with about 1/4 cup of walnuts.They are not real sweet which I like.  They are best right out of the oven while they are still warm and the white chocolate is still melted.Ummmm!  My husband loves them as well as my 1 1/2 year old. I made half the batch without walnuts for them. I am a nut person so I think they are best with the walnuts added. I made these last night for family members and everyone raved over these cookies. They all wanted the ones with the walnuts. I got this recipe the first time from the back of the dried cranberry package. It was thrown away not knowing what a hit they would be, so I went online and found this. I'm saving it this time.",

I added vanilla, used fresh cranberries (as I had those on hand), was out of flour (or I would have used whole wheat) so I used self rising (all I had), and I did flatten out the cookies before I baked them.  I am also a nut lover, so next time I make these, and I will, I will throw in some chopped nuts.  Oh, I also got 3 1/2 dozen from this batch, maybe I made them smaller than they need be, but I didn't want them baking too close together....and I did cut back on the baking time...9-10 minutes.  Yummy!!  Please give these a try.",
