I wanted a really good drink mix and had heard about this one and decided to give it a try even though I do not drink coffee. I am so glad I did because it is deelicious and Iwill be making several batches to give as Christmas gifts. I checked several other mixes before trying this one and after reading the reviews and noticing that in every recipe people would change something because it was not sweet enough did not have enough coffee taste etc. that I decided to make this one because no one changed anything. It is truly perfect as is. Thank you so much CATWWALK16 for sharing this recipe.",

THIS. IS. IT. It was easy enough that my older son could help me make it for his Dad and just the right measurements of everything called for in the recipe. And he loves it. So do his co-workers.;) I will add that I bought most of the ingredients at Grocery Outlet so don't feel like you have to buy expensive products at the regular grocery store. Off brands or factory seconds work just as well as the name brand labels! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I'm incredibly grateful. EDITED 12/23/08: I made a double batch of this for my family. This filled eight grande latte cups with just a little left over. I filled them to the brim slapped the lids on and covered the drink hole with a sticker. Worked out perfectly.",

I also cut down the sugar by a half a cup (don't forget the hot chocolate has sugar too).  I used decaffinated instant coffee so I wouldn't have to worry about drinking it before bed, and I've tested a few different types of hot chocolate now, and Swiss Miss and Goodiva (about the same) are the best.  Cadbury was so/so.  Suprisingly the Goodiva wasn't much chocolatier.  I was looking for Ghiradelli but couldn't find just their drinking cocoa.  My boyfriend loved it too so I made him his own container.  Great for the upcoming winter months!",

And I am glad I did because it is amazing! So perfect after a long and chilly day. I am totally hooked! In anticipation of not really caring for it I bought the cheapest instant coffee hot chocolate mix and creamer I could find and it is STILL incredible. Not only will I be putting this in my holiday gift baskets I will be making it for myself and my daughter (a Starbucks fanatic) to enjoy throughout the winter.
