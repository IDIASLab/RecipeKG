To remedy that, I transferred it to a skillet and cooked the liquid down to crisp it up. If you choose not to use the optional habanero, I do recommend you use a jalapeno or something to bring some heat so that you get that perfect balance of sweet/heat. I actually used 2 habanero's but we like it spicy. Overall a great recipe, just be sure to discard some of the juice in that final cooking.",
