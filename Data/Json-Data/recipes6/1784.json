I actually had a 4.5 lbs bird and my bird was done at 350 about 1.5 hours in so depending on your oven (mine is extremely efficient) keep an eye on it. Only thing I'd add is rinsing the chicken with cold water and patting it dry otherwise the skin can't crisp. I found my turkey was to 165 BEFORE the crust had fully crisped/settled. It tasted great but the skin got soft/wet quickly especially when trying to get it off the can... though the can I used was a tall beer so that may have been why I struggled.",
