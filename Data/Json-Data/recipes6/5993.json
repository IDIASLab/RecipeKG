Forgot the cheese. Upped the cilantro. Minimal chili/spice.  I always tweak recipes, this was a great starting point.\nMost important: brush Olive oil or vegetable oil or spray on the ones you cook and also on any you might keep to cook later.\nDrain all liquid off canned tomatoes  and really rinse black beans and drain well.. I used the tomato juice from canned tomatoes for salsa combined with fresh tomatoes, only used half a can of tomatoes. \nOh and squeezed a whole (Persian) Lime into the mix. Brightens the taste. Fun to play with this recipe.\nCan't go wrong as long as you stick to the basic flavor profile.",

The first batch I made without the cilantro, but the rest of the batches  had it added in.  The cilantro was the key ingredient in my opinion.
