We don't put anything on them, they are very sweet themselves.  But I'm sure they would be great with some fresh fruit.

Then whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks before very gently folding them back into the batter.\n\nWhisking to stiff peaks is tough - I suggest using electric mixers and you may need a stablizer such as cream of tarter.  But this should help the texture tremendously!",

Like many of the reviewers I did not think these were crispy at all. I ended up baking my waffles for a few minutes at 350 to give them more crunch. It seems like there is too much moisture in the recipe-- perhaps one less egg next time. I also used coconut oil to grease my waffle iron.",

                "reviewBody": "Since it's been mentioned that the almond meal/flour used can make a difference I will say that I used 'Bob's Red Mill Almond meal' to make these. I wasn't too sure about the lack of oil or milk but I get plenty of both in my diet & I was surprised at how runny the batter was. WARNING These cook up FAST!!! My DH (the waffle chef at our house) burned the first one because they cook so fast. As others have noted they do not crisp up like a good waffle should. Also previously noted they are more \"eggy\" than a normal waffle (it reminded me of the \"egginess\" of a french twist donut). These two things combined equal 1 star lost in rating. Still tasty & worth adding to my personal recipie collection but not over-the-top all-out to-die-for delicious. I liked the heartier texture & the light sweetness. Even better with a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter. I also liked these better plain than I did with butter which never happens for me. Syrup is definitely not needed. I didn't add fruit or yoghurt as suggested but may next time - I can see where they would compliment the taste & texture. I also think I might try subbing almond extract for the vanilla. These are a pleasant change of pace that I will make again & I really love the natural ingredients that allows most of the people I know with health/dietary restrictions to enjoy these with me.",

They are a bit on the sweet side so they would go great with a simple fresh fruit topping and some plain old-fashion whipped cream. One thing I would like to mention is that they do not have the crispness or cakeyness of waffles; they have more of a pancake texture. That said I would still make them in the waffle iron as they shape up beautifully. Thanks nmyers11!",

One suggestion that I have for the people who are trying to follow the paleo diet is using unsweetened apple sauce instead of honey and maybe using half coconut flour and half almond flour and use sea salt.  This will add the sweetness without the honey and will be paleo.  Although, I am not sure if this recipe is supposed to be paleo but if you wanted to make it paloe thats what I would do.",
