I've made this twice and put the custard in a 6 x 9 pan and baked as indicated in the recipe. I bake it until the custard is golden brown and set in the middle. It takes quite some time to bake so be patient and wait till it is golden brown and set. MOST IMPORTANTLY.....add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the mixture prior to baking ! It really makes this recipe complete.  TY for a great recipe!",
