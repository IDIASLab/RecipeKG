The recipe doesn't specify, but I used what I thought was an appropriate, fragant smoked Spanish paprika which was really, really good. I used the amount called for even tho' I thought it might be too much for me, but it was just a lovely, delicate smoky flavor that also lent color to the dish. Same with the chili pepper flakes - I thought I'd be sorry using the amount called for and nearly chickened out. Glad I didn't - that, too, was just right.  I prepared this with one alteration, which was simply to wait until the shrimp was nearly cooked to add the garlic, since garlic and high heat don't mix and burnt garlic is just plain nasty.  In deference to the title I chose dry sherry rather than lemon, and because I welcomed the opportunity to do something other than lemon for a change.  I served this alongside a tossed green salad which made for a lovely, fresh, light but deliciously satisfying meal.",

This fit the bill! No measureing just looked over the ingredients and went with it. I have a great smoked spanish paprika that I love to use and it really shined in this recipe.
