This dish was very popular at a table with 6 year olds 20 year olds 50 year olds and 80 year olds. Everyone liked. That being said I did not make the \"add-ins\" as a sauce. It was just less time to skip that step entirely. I made the pearl couscous added chopped black olives and sun dried tomatoes feta cheese pressed the garlic skipped the shallots having none on hand and at the very end added the pine nuts. Tasty. I'm sure the original way is very good this was just easier. Pearl couscous is very forgiving. Doesn't get mushy easy. Have made this twice already. It's a keeper.",

However, after adding the sauce to it and mixing, it did break apart.  Next time, I will prepare the sauce first, and then cook the couscous.  If necessary, I think the sauce could sit for a while better than the couscous, so this is just a matter of switching preparation steps.  For our tastes, this had too many pine nuts for a topping, and I also would cut back on the olive oil when toasting them.  The sun-dried tomatoes bring sweetness, the olives give you a little punch of the brine, and the pine nuts lend a delicate earthiness to the dish.  Served this today as a side dish, but I can totally see adding a protein and making this a main course.  Very nice Erin.",
