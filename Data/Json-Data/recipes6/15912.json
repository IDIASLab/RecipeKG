It's basically a cinnamon roll if you don't add the nuts/raisns/melted butter& brown sugar in the bottom of the pan.  If you do, then it's a sticky bun.  I doubled the mixture for the inside and I doubled the \"sticky bun\" bottom of the pan mixture.  The rising part takes about 3-4 hours, so cover these with a dish cloth and be patient.  While these were baking in the oven I made an icing as if these need any more sweetness, but I just couldn't resist because I was sending these to work with my husband : 3 oz. cream cheese softened, 1 Tbsp butter softened or butter flavored shortening, 1 & 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2 Tbsp. milk.  Add all the ingredients together and add the milk gradually untill you get the desired consistency.  Spread the icing over the sticky buns or cinnamons rolls while they are still warm.",

Turn it on, knob or setting at 350, for two minutes, just to get the oven warm. Then turn it off.  Rise your rolls in the oven.  You'll find that your rolls will rise in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I'll review the recipe later when I try it.  Enjoy!",

I also had enough dough left over to make a dozen \"cinnamon knots\" which only had to bake 10 minutes. Delicious! Next time I will probably double the filling!",
