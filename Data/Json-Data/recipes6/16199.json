I wanted to use a chocolate ganache but I didn't have any heavy cream and I didn't want to drive to the store. This is what I did. I made the icing just as directed but I used the special dark cocoa. That was a great choice. As soon as it came off the stove I stired it just a little with a wire wisk and poured it on top of my cooled cake. It sat up so beautiful with a shine like you wouldn't believe. This was almost too easy to make and I will use it from now on instead of a ganache!!!",
