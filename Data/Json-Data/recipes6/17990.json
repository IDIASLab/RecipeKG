Here is a tip when combining a hot liquid to an egg mixture. While stirring very quickly, add some of the egg mixture to the hot milk. Then pour the milk into the egg mixture(keep stirring).  This keeps the eggs from cooking and turning into scrambled eggs.  Personally, I think this dessert is best served completely cold. Next time I might try adding a little almond extract to see how that turns out.",

This was a good pie but not quite how I remember the cafeteria pie--granted it's been a long time. I concur with those who note how eggy the pie was. Perhaps its a silly observation as one cannot have custard without eggs but I'm now looking for a three egg recipe to see how that works. Also I was uncomfortable with the idea of boiling the milk (and I wasn't sure of the point of boiling it) so I scalded it instead. I didn't cover the crust because I didn't leave much exposed. I set my time for 30 minutes because the oven wasn't quite heated up when I put the pie in--and I nearly burned the top. While the top had brown splotches the flavor was good.",
