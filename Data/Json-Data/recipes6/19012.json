Southern homemade cream-style corn is made by slicing the kernels of a corn cob then sliding the knife blade down the cob scraping off what's left of the corn kernels. This makes a creamier dish without the use of cream (my grandparents in Kentucky make this every year and freeze it for the winter). I used the immersion blender on this corn for a couple of pulses and that helped immensely for those of us who don't like large kernels in our cream-style corn.",

I used 4 ears of corn cut off the cob and processed a little a can of evaporated milk and followed the rest of the recipe. The flavor is wonderful but since I used fresh corn I think it should cook longer depending on the texture you want. The 20 minutes still gave it a crunch which I like but simmering an extra 10 or so probably wouldn't hurt.",
