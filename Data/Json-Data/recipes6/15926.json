I also added about 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as others have recommended. I followed another users recommendation to seperate the whites from the eggs (beated until fluffy) and folded them into the batter as the final step--turned out nice and fluffy. I served these plain with the cinnamon butter recipe. Also, you can freeze left-overs (if any) in plastic baggies to be taken out at a later time to be quickly reheated in the toaster. 5-star plus--thanks for the wonderful recipe!",

A good active-yeast recipe will taste better, but are generally more dense.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure to USE BAKING POWDER, NOT SODA, then the 4 teaspoons called for is perfect, if you put in 4 tsp of soda you'll never have heartburn again...\r\n\r\nBottom line, these waffles are well worth making.

Wanted to try something new this morning with basic ingredients that I knew I had in the kitchen.  \r\n\r\nThe first waffle didn't turn out because I didn't use enough batter--my waffle iron needed about 2/3 cup each--but after that they were perfect.\r\n\r\nFor those new to waffle-making, here is a good tip I have used to know when they are done without having to open the iron constantly to look (which can ruin the waffle if it is still soft)...  It's done when the waffle quits ejecting plumes of steam around the edges of the iron.  (It's also usually done when it quits sticking to the iron.)\r\n\r\nWill definitely make these again -- probably tomorrow!",

Instead of 2 eggs I used 3 egg whites and I used skim milk made into buttermilk instead of 2% milk (just add 1-1/2T lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes). In place of \u00bd cup of oil I used fat-free vanilla yogurt.  I agree with other reviews that the recipe as written is a little bland so instead of 1 tbsp white sugar I used \u00bc cup Splenda.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and about a heaping tsp cinnamon.  I can feel GOOD about serving a 195 calorie waffle as opposed to a 400 calorie waffle - especially when my picky husband can't tell the difference!",

Yum Yum!\nSugar changed 2 tablespoon brown sugar AND 2 tablespoon white sugar\nvanilla extract changed 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract\nAdded 1/4 tsp of cinnamon did not want to overpower the flavor of the waffles themselves.  \nThe other changes I did were on the building...\nThe eggs and how they are incorporated.. and yes, again this is redundant because sooo many others have said the same thing and it works to make them light and delicious!\nseperate the eggs... put the whites in the blender and whip them till they start forming the fluffy whites... then add the yolks on low... then i added the milk, then the vegetable oil allowing to mix before adding the vanilla and all the dry goods (mix them before hand in another bowl).  \nThis helped produce a light waffle that really melted in my mouth YUM!
