I found that chilling in the freezer was the only way to get this firm enough to keep its shape for serving and it makes it even more refreshing. Also I used a 10\" pie plate and still had leftover crust (enough to make a miniature pie for the kids with no tequila). To make (2) 9x13 pies triple the filling and only double the crust. Garnish w/salted lime slices (1/4 rounds) and a little dollop of extra CoolWhip. So pretty! Be sure to NOT just dump the pretzels into the food processor - you could end up with ALL the loose salt from the bottom of the bag! You want salty but not THAT salty! Learned that one the hard way.:)",

I read all the reviews and learned the pie could be loose, so I added a 1/2 package of softened cream cheese and cut back on the Cool Whip.  I didn't have any fresh limes on hand, so I used conentrated lime juice and a dash of Rose's Sweetened lime juice. I kept adding lime and orange to a taste that I liked - probably a bit more than the recipe called for.  I put the pie in the freezer for 45 minutes and it set up beautifully and cut very well. With the cream cheese, the pie is probably a little heavier, but has a great consistency. I also kept the pretzel pieces a little bigger to give some texture. Thanks for a terrific recipe!   ",

I have what's left of it in the freezer now to see if a frozen or semi-frozen version would be better, but as written the filling was very runny even after chilling for an hour and a half in the refrigerator.  I'll probably give this one another try, but I'd use less whipped topping - maybe even just half a container.  It has very good flavor, so I think it has potential, but I was hoping for a firmer pie.  ***UPDATE***  After freezing overnight, the texture was much better - like a soft ice cream.  Four stars as a frozen dessert - but I would still like to try reducing the amount of whipped topping next time.",
