These had really great flavor and not at all spicy even though I almost tripled the wing sauce for more flavor (I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce). I used hoagie buns that I needed to use up and added a bit of prepared Ranch dressing to the sauce mixture which added a nice tang. I slathered the sauce on both sides of the buns then layered as directed. My pepperjack cheese had mysteriously disappeared (thank you Mr. CookinBug) so I used a mixture of shredded mozzarella and cheddar. Will definitely make these again and again. Thanks:)",

I agree with many reviewers that 1) you can increase the wing sauce and 2) in should be baked open face to melt the cheese and get the sandwich nice and hot inside. You could add other favorites like grilled onions to add to the already awesome flavor. My teenage and older girls lived the sandwich. Thanks!",
