One additional note......Instead of using a biscut cutter, I just rolled the dough out and cut it up in rectangles, put the 2 slits in, and before I was ready to fry it, I streched them a little.\r\nThese are also great the next day warmed in the toaster oven!!!!!!

With the help of CindyLepp (recipe buzz) she was able to find the common name for german donuts so this was the recipe I ended up using. This was a long process but it was worth it. I made this two ways: the first half was done as written and the second half I had rolled out the dough a little thinner cut it about 5-6 inches square/rectangle and rested it for a bit (not to double it's size) before frying. We actually liked the thinner bigger squares/rectangles better because that's how my husbands granny made it; it had that puffed up blistered appearance. We topped it with powdered sugar and a runny glaze. The first half (as written) tasted like beignets which is not a bad thing. August 26 2011 very versatile; also used this sweet dough for pull-apart rolls and cinnamon rolls.",
