[I have never used applesauce as a replacement in baking, this was my first attempt, and the cake came out delicious.] Also, I do not have a round dish of any sort so I used what I believe is 8x8 or 8x10 glass Pyrex dish.  This cake is not tough or chewy, but denser than, say, birthday cake, and it is sooo good paired with the peach juices, etc. I had canned peaches on hand and went looking for a recipe in which to use them. This is it! I am so happy because the ingredients called for are usually staples in most pantries. It was pretty simple to make, and can be a fancy treat for guests on a short notice! I did not find the recipe to be too sweet like others mentioned. I know that having cavities can heighten your discomfort when eating sugary foods, so I will just assume that some people will find this too sweet and others will not. This recipe is outstanding.. And I am bringing my leftovers to my co-workers this afternoon!",
