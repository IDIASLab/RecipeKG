Then I put the loaf under the broiler cheese side up and toast that side.  The whole loaf gets toasted that way.  My friends and family ohh and ahhh about it every time I make it!",

I keep roasted garlic in my fridge so I just used about 15 cloves, pushed them through the garlic press & then halved the rest of the recipe for slices of toast since it was just hubby & I. I served it on a thoroughly cleaned & sanitized Texas license plate in keeping w/ the 4th of July theme. Thsi is the best garlic toast I have ever eaten...thanks for the recipe!",
