I did elect to use fat free 1/2 & 1/2 rather than whipping cream to save some calories (and that richness is not what I felt was missing).  I also used chicken broth, rather than water + bullion.   I used fresh garlic since I had some on hand (and meant to skip the garlic powder, but forgot and added it, too).  After tasting, I added a dash of white pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a bite.  After eating my first small serving, I decided to use my immersion blender to see if that would help.  It did; it helped get a little more potato in each bite.  This is good, and I'm sure my gram who prefers foods on the blander side will love, and worth making if you're looking to use some leftover ham.  THANKS for the recipe!",

After all was cooked I removed about half of the soup from the pot and gave it a whirl with a stick blender. (then returned the rest to the pot). It made it a creamier soup. Also in hindsight I would make sure it the bouillon and/or the ham was reduced sodium ( and no real need for salting after the fact)",

I added more ham than the recipe calls for (probably 2-3 cups of leftover cubed ham) used canned corn (instead of frozen) and added a little celery. I also used a few more potatoes and cubed them into smaller pieces instead of just quartering. I used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 1 because of the volume of broth. Overall this is a great tasting rich comfort type soup.",
