I've been using limeade as a sour mix substitute for years because it's just so simple and always on hand.  If you add a half oz of OJ to the original recipe, it's even better.  Plus, it never hurts to add the juice of a lemon or lime as it's blending.  You can even do a half oz of Chambord or Grand Marnier \"float\" after you've poured them (Chambord is delish!!).  Or, add some fresh or frozen fruit to the original recipe and make fruit margaritas.  If you don't have fruit but have some flavored liquors at home, throw some in (sour apple pucker is very popular right now).  Easy recipe to work with and it's made many of my anti-tequila friends huge margarita fans.  Hope this helps.",

They taste SO MUCH better then those made with mix from the bottle!! \r\nOne quick tip for easy measuring that I use- I dump the can of frozen limeade in the blender, fill the limeade can 3/4 full with tequilla and the remainder full (1/4) with the triple sec, pour that in then fill the blender with ice. Turn on the blender and let the party begin! Much easier then using a measuring cup. \r\nIf this is too strong then simply fill the can half way with tequilla and add triple sec to make the can 3/4 full.",

Also, try substituting Blue Curaco (also an orange liquor) for the triple sec to make a Blue Margarita.  Or to cut down on the alcohol just use plain fresh squeezed oranges instead of the triple sec.  There are lots of additions you can make - but nothing beats this margarita!",

Also, you can de-seed then puree and freeze in ice cube trays for later use. Just pop them in a zipper bag to keep fresh tasting. These will be the hit at your BBQ or next party!",
