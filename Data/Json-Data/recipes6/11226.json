Just make sure you toss the fruit in a tablespoon or so of flour before adding them to the recipe, that way the fruit will not sink to the bottom.

I used butter instead of shortening, added in 2tsp vanilla, used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/4 heavy cream 1/4 milk for the liquid for a richer flavor(can also use 1/2 cup sour cream instead which makes it very tasty too).  As far as the topping- I as well used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 white sugar. I don't think you need to add any extra blueberries-there was plenty.  It is a very heavy batter so don't be fooled when you can't pour it into the pan-just spoon it in and spread it around.  Does take like 50+ minutes to bake-so keep checking the middle til your knife comes out clean.  Def a keeper!  If making for a larger crowd..double and bake in a 13x9 inch pan for 1 hour.",

I certainly won't follow this recipe again, but I will try one like it with all the modifications in place.

I can understand changing things like brown sugar in place of white sugar for the topping, but the amount of flour, the use of shortening, etc. are essential components of the recipe and if changed, it becomes an entirely different recipe. This cake is just perfectly soft, moist, and delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and amazing blueberry flavor. A lot of people have stated that the blueberries sink to the bottom, but a lot of those same people thinned out the batter by reducing the amound of flour. This batter is supposed to be very thick, as that's what holds up the blueberries, and trust me the finished cake is not lacking in moisture AT ALL. That's probably due to the shortening, so if you used butter instead, you changed the recipe and ended up with a drier cake and blamed it on the flour :O Stick with the recipe and you'll do fine. The only thing I had to do differently was double the baking time. I did dredge the blueberries in flour just in case, but I doubt they would've sunk either way. Add some flaked coconut or lemon zest to this cake for a yummy variation.",

It raised beautifully in an 8x8 pan and the top crumb crust was lovely.  I baked it for 45 min.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  Thanks!",
