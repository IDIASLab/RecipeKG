Even the ones that were only going to 'taste' it and were sure they weren't going to like it.  I proved them wrong.   To prevent some of the 'runny filling' issues, I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the filling mixture. Then I melted some butter in a pan, added the filling and cooked it until it was thick. I let it cool before putting in the pie crust.  For my version, I sliced the tomatoes quite thin, maybe an 1/8 inch.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  For my next pie, I would use more than 4 cups of sliced tomatoes...just to have more filling in the pie.  The more tomatoes added, also add more sugar.",
