Used 1/4 tsp salt, oil instead of butter, and 1/2 tsp each of the spices (just right - don't like too spicy).  Done at 15 mins, but prefer the 20 mins as they were more chewy and great muffin crust.  Also, used a vegetable peeler to get off the orange part of the rind and threw away the bitter pith (the skins were too thick, I guess).  The blender worked well in chopping up big pieces of rind.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe - it will be one of my favorites. ",
