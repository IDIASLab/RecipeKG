I followed the recipe to the gram, even though I am not a fan of sweet tea, nor am I fond of fennel but I followed the measurements precisely and am so happy I did. There is no need to change anything about this recipe. The pepper is not too spicy but has a slight pinch after a few sips, then dissipates and the other flavours simply mingle together for a pleasant aftertaste. It is a true keeper recipe. Thank you food4fit for sharing your recipe.",

But I like my chai tea REALLY spicy so the next time I really increased the amounts.  For example the peppercorns I increased to over a tablespoon and the same for the cloves and cardamom pods. I didn\u2019t increase the sugar or the ginger as extremely. You really can\u2019t mess up this recipe by adjusting the amounts because it\u2019s all just preference. I also let the spices simmer gently for about an hour to really draw out the flavour (before adding the tea). Because I made so much I stored leftover in mason jars in the fridge (I don\u2019t add the milk in yet at this point). That way I have enough for several days . Just pour some into a latte cup and heat in the microwave, add some frothed milk and you\u2019re good to go.",
