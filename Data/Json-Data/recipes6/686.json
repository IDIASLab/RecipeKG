I've made this twice; here are my recommendations: definitely soak the french bread slices individually in the egg mixture (someone else commented on this) to ensure no dry pieces or overly soggy pieces. 2) depending on the french bread you buy, you may need an additional pan (double the recipe) 3) used aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes and then cooked for an additional ten minutes (watch oven) to brown up the toast. You may want to add a dash of cinnamon to it as well.",
