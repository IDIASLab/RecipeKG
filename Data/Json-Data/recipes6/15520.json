I'm not one who is afraid to try a new recipe on someone else! :)  These were just what I was looking for...sweet, but not too sweet, dense, hearty.  I made no changes other than using raw sugar (hate that white stuff!!).  I lined the pan w/foil and they lifted right out...made it easy to cut for transporting.  This one is definately a keeper.  May try half white/half whole wheat flour next time.  Thank you!",

And I LOVE to surprise people by having chocolate in a pumpkin bar recipe. Tastes much better than it sounds! In the future I will put some kind of icing on them. People are disappointed when you don't have the cream chese icing on pumpkin bars. Overall though it is a good recipe and something worth making again!",

VERY, VERY GOOD.  In my oven it didn't take as long to cook so watch carefully.  I have made these twice now and everyone has loved them.  Will be making them again and again.",
