I didn't have any vanilla beans for the sugar so just used powdered sugar.  Then, I added 1/4tsp vanilla and 1/4tsp almond extract to the cookie dough.  ",

The eight to ten minute baking time is off tho. At 325 the cookies should bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. Because they're such a delicate cookie, I let them cool completely before I start to dip them into the sugar. I use regular granulated sugar as powdered tends to yellow and disappear into the cookie.

After cutting butter into the dry mixture I scraped it onto a sheet of plastic wrap and made a log wrapping the dough. I chilled the dough for a while before shaping it into crescents---but this could have been a mistake because cookies started becoming really lax and flattened out while baking. As the first reviewers suggested I cooled the cookies on the baking sheet until they are solid. This way I had no problem transfering them to the cooling rack. I will have to experiment with this but great cookies overall.",

I don't know exactly how this traditional cookie should taste so I can't rate its authenticity. I baked the cookies a bit longer than the directions because they were still so soft. Even then the challenge became to coat the cookies with the powdered sugar without breaking the crescents. The cookies were very delicate. I allowed them to cool just a bit longer than suggested though I got them off the cookie sheets quickly so they didn't become a scraping challenge. Great flavor and a beautiful delicate cookie.
