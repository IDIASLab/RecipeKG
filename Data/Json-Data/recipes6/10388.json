I used finely chopped pecans (instead of the walnuts) and 1/2 package of butterscotch pudding mix(cook and serve kind only).  I sprayed a teflon bundt pan with Pam, poured in the pecans, sprinkled them with the dry pudding mix.  Then I quartered BUTTERMILK (these keep moist much better during cooking) biscuits and rolled each piece in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and layered it on top of the pecans.  Three cans of Pillsbury's filled my pan exactly.  Then I poured the brown sugar/butter mixture on top and baked it for about 40minutes and turned it over on a serving platter....it didn't stick at all, looked BEAUTIFUL, tasted absolutely delicious and gooey (I had no hard bottom layer, it was moist throughout).  Will make for every birthday breakfast, holiday breakfast, etc for years to come....a recipe to pass down!",
