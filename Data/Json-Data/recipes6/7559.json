I used the slow cooker feature on my Instant Pot\u00ae,  checked at 2 hours, and the potatoes were not only cooked, but actually overcooked.  No whisking the potatoes was required because the potatoes already were turning to mush.  Granted, maybe I cubed  my potatoes smaller than others, but I\u2019d recommend that you start checking for doneness at about 1-1/2 hours.  Cooking that many strips of bacon leaves you with a LOT of bacon fat (too much IMO), so I removed all but about 2 tablespoons to brown the onions.  Also, it really needed a pretty good dose of salt and pepper, was fairly bland.  I didn\u2019t have Cheddar-Monterey Jack blend, but I did have each type of cheese, so I just shredded the two of them (worked fine), melted beautifully after a couple stirs.  And I used fat free half-and-half which was what I had on hand.  So a few tweaks along the way, but this turned out to be a creamy, tasty potato soup that I would make again with the changes above.",
