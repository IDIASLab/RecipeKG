The air fryer does a nice job of crisping up the chips if you follow the recipe's guidance on slicing thinly and drying well. Just watch the timing. I found closer to 10 minutes was better for the machine I was using. I might not make them again just because it took about 8 batches to do 1 potato, but if I get a bigger machine, I would be able to fit in more in each batch!",
