I pulsed my pecans in my food processer until they were broken up but not completely ground. I used the amounts called for with everything except the butter. I just added enough to moisten the crust, but not drench it. The nuts have natural oils that come out during baking. Don't forget to refridgerated this before baking, because it really helps hold it together. I used this for a cheesecake recipe, and let me tell you, it got RAVE reviews!! And the best part is, that there is no flour and so it is gluten free...perfect for my mother in law with celiac. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!",

I made this crust dairy free by using coconut oil in place of the butter. I baked the crust for about 8 mins at 350 and let it cool. THen I filled it with a gluten/casein free pumpkin filling. I was afraid the nut crust might burn (it was starting to smell that way) so I placed a piece of foil shiny side down under it and a strip of foil shiny side out around it. It worked like a charm! The crust came out perfectly! I highly recommend this recipe. Even a beginner can make this!",
