I've only made them once so far and had to tweak it since I had no corn syrup. I ended up adding 1/4 cup brown sugar instead and adding the whole egg. The texture came out delicately crispy and crunchy like a tea cookie and I loved it (I enjoy crunchy and crispy far more than chewy cookies). I'm not sure how the original recipe should come out but I liked the tweaked version so much I'll probably just make it that way.",

I don't really even like gingersnaps but these are great--sort of a cross between a snickerdoodle and a gingersnap. I don't know--they're hard to describe but they're delicious. In my opinion the best way to do them is to place each ball of dough in the white sugar and press it down into the white sugar. This gives it more coverage with sugar and it looks more sparkly after cooking. I liked the look better without dipping in the powdered sugar afterwards.",

I didn't have any dark corn syrup so I did what another reviewer suggested using 1/4 cup brown sugar and a whole egg instead of the white alone. And somehow I managed to run out of baking soda without noticing so I used a heaping tsp. of baking powder. I also rolled them in turbinado sugar instead of white -- beautiful! These are the kinds of cookies that you have to keep eating because that wonderful ginger and spice flavor stays in your mouth. This recipe is definitely going to become a regular thing in my house!",
