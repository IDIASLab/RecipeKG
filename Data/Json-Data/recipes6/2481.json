Oh WOW I just realized that I used 6 times the amount of chipotle called for. I cut the servings down to 5 but the 1/8 t chipotle chili powder still read as 1/8 t. Since my husband likes things hot I put in 1/4 t for 5 servings!!! It was a bit too hot for me but he liked it. (I think this proves you could definitely increase the chili powder if you like things hot.) I used it on smoked sausage that I served over rice. Thanks for a nice new sauce!",
