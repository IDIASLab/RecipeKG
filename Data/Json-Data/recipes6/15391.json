Why i gave it 3 stars then??? it had WAY too much sugar in it. I followed it to the \"T\" and i love sugary things but i couldn't handle more than one cookie at a time next time i'm starting with 1 cup of sugar and going up a bit from there if needed but i think there was 1 cup too much in that recipe and i love sugar things so it had to be too sugary. tips: if you don't have wax paper on hand use a tad cooking spray on the sheets. also it's good because this recipe i made out of staples.. so if you want something sweet or need a quick treat it's great bc you have these things on hand anyhow!",

When my husband heard I was making \"no-bake cookies\", he said \"uh...yuck\".  When I was almost done with them, he said \"Oh! Hey! My mom used to make these, we called them splat cookies!\"  And according to him, they taste just like the ones he used to have as a kid.  I did use a little less sugar, as suggested by some, and I'm glad I did, they came out perfectly.  ***EDIT-I just made a batch of these using extra peanut butter, and rice krispies instead of oatmeal, and they were even better.",

I didn't have all the chocolate powder drink mix that the recipe calls for but I did have two small mug size packets of the hot chocolate mix in addition to and abundance of Nestle's regular baking cocoa so with the double batch that came out to approx. 1/2 cup of chocolate mix with marshmallows and a 1/2 cup of powdered baking cocoa. I believe this was a good combination but it does seem that these should be eaten sparingly with a tall glass of milk (as suggested by HollyHolly in another post) or else you may be in the emergency room from sugar shock:o). Overall a very very good recipe. I give it four stars!",
