I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The habaneros made it perfectly spicy and they are a sweet hot pepper so meshed well.  Even my 11 year old loved it!  I love the idea of doing this sauce with boneless loin chops so will try that next!  Oh - don't even THINK of skipping the fresh thyme.   Wonderful!\n\nPro-tip: Instead of all of the chopping and dicing I quartered the onions, peeled the garlic and ginger, hollowed out the habaneros without touching the insides and tossed everything into my food processor.   Since you're blending into smooth anyways much easier to just let it blend that spend the extra time chopping and mincing.",

The seasoning was as good as anything I have had in a restaurant. I used a jalepano instead of habenero. I also seared the pork on the stove at medium-high heat for 10 min then threw it in the oven for 20-25 min. Dont overcook. Pork is done at 160 degrees. When I pulled it out of the oven I cut up the meat and left it in the sauce to absorb the remaining juices. So nice! Thanks Chef John.",

So last weekend when whole pork loins were on sale I bought one and put it in my slow cooker with the marinade. The house smelled so good. When I was ready to serve I pulled it apart some but not completely. Served with beans and rice and everyone raved how good it was. Best of all it looked and tasted just like the jerk pork hubby gets at his favorite restaurant. Thank you!!!",
