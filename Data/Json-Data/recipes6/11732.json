I noticed that some people have had trouble with it not setting up. I have never had that problem with any of the 4 batches I have made. You have to make sure you dissolve the sugar over low head BEFORE you begin to boil it for 6 min.  The dissolving stage may take some time, I think it took me about 20 min today.  Use your finger to touch some of the mixture on a spoon to test for grainyness.  If you feel grains, continue stirring to dissolve.  Also, someone said you need 12tablespoons of butter, that is not true at all.  I would think adding more butter would make it take longer to set up.  It takes about 2.5-3 hours to set up.  I put it in the refrigerator to set up, then it stays hard at room temperature.  Also, a hint for measuring the 2 cups of marshmallow creme, just use a 7oz jar.  It's about 2 cups.  That will save you from the sticky mess.  Hope this helps a little for those who had poor luck with this recipe.",

This recipe was quick and easy to make and as soon as I started dumping it into the pan I could tell it was going to set up just perfectly. Licked the spatula and lo and behold it even tastes good! Nice creamy texture and a very good taste. I will keep looking for that perfect fudge I remember from childhood but for now this one is my favorite recipe. Thanks!",

However, I really don't understand the complexity of the directions wanting you to pour the scalding syrup over the chips and in two pans no less.  As soon as that 6 minutes of boiling stops, take it off the flame, incorporate the marshmallow creme and then throw in all the chocolate and stir to melt it all.  This fudge sets up quickly as soon as the chocolate hits and the more you mess with it the less attractive it gets (it gets dull).  I always use a 9x13 pan and I grease it lightly with butter.  Note:dark chocolate chips work beautifully for a richer fudge and sometimes don't use the nuts.  I make a pan of plain and a pound of nut and divide it up for Christmas gifts.  Note the basic recipe makes a little more than 6 generous pounds of fudge.  I always make it for a charity event we have where food is auctioned off and often have people bid up to $25 a pound.",
