You can use almost any dried fruits you like, up to about 2 1/2 cups, and you can adjust the sweetness to taste, too.  I used 1 cup whole bite sized prunes, 1/2cup dark raisins, 1/2cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup dried cranberries and/or 1/2 cup dried dark sweet cherries.  I started with 1/2cup of sugar and added about 1/4 cup more. (the cranberries needed it!) I added some additional orange juice at the end along with the lemon juice (I didn't use the lemon slices because the white pith is too bitter and comes through in the sauce)  This is a very slightly jelled liquid that is wonderful chilled or warmed.  Tasty along with creamy rice or tapioca pudding on some pound cake or Julekage bread and butter.  Mmmm!",
