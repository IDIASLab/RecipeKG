So, I visited allrecipes.com and found this already 5 star rated recipe and it lives up to that rating!  My daughter had the greatest time making this with me.  We followed the recipe to the \"T\" and loved every bite!  I know anyone who tries this recipe will thoroughly enjoy it!  Its restaurant quality in our opinion.  My husband and I have recently returned from London.  There we dined in many fine restuarants of which none have come close to this recipe.  A chicken consomme from our 5 star hotel did not compare to the flavors of this recipe.  Try it, enjoy it then share it with others.",

But the kids were sick and with stroke of genious it hit...Aha! Make chicken soup! So off to store we go sick crabby \"I don't want to ride in the cart\" 2 year old and the baby secure in the sling. I look for and find some chickens. They look smaller than I thought. I look through all 50 of them looking for the biggest one. They are all about 3 pounds. So I ask an employee where the regular sizd chickens are you know the turkey-sized ones. Well chickens as it turns out are not as big as turkeys and the employee laughs. Ok so now I have chicken and I leave store. I call grandma on the way asking what to do with it. She tells me to clean it. Ummm....how? She tells me and I respond \"I stick my hand up WHAT???\" That's not somewhere I'd like to touch. Grams reminds me its just a chicken I can wash my hands later. Ok big breath. I can do it. I clean and cook chicken. I cool it bone it (ick) and then make soup. Now to rate this recipe....its great! I've gotten over my fear of whole chickens and I'll make it again! I did add garlic peas and spinach to boost the nutritional value. I didn't add the chicken soup mix wanting it to be natural as possible. All in all great recipe. Thanks for sharing it and helping me get over the hurdle of whole chickens!",

As with almost all recipes, I fixed it a little more to my liking and to what I had on hand.\nI wouldn't buy a whole chicken simply to boil and make a soup out of.  That's what leftovers are for...to make soup.  Take a broiled chix...eat it and then boil the carcass in enough water to cover.  Shred leftover meat, keep aside.  Drain boiled carcass..toss bones, keep broth.  Add to broth 2 tbsp chix boullion, 2 cubes beef boullion, sliced carrot, onion, celery and chix.  Add the following spices as you see fit: Thyme, basil,parsely, pepper, red pepper flakes (Careful! 1/2 tsp goes a LONG way) noodles of your choice and simmer for 30-40 mins and voila!  Easy chix soup!  ",
