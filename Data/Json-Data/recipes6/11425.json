For chocolate cake this had very little chocolate flavor even after I increased the number of tbls. of cocoa to 9. Also it lacks in sweetness. This cake might be good for someone who likes a less sweet cake...but one thing's for sure it DEFINITELY needs icing of some kind to provide flavor. I found the cake to be very bland and I was really disappointed with the results...come to think of it I even inreased the amount of vanilla by one teaspoon as well! Maybe also increasing the amount of sugar and using melted chocolate instead of baking cocoa would help. There are much MUCH better mayo cake recipes out there...I only gave this two stars because the texture of the cake is very nice (nice rich crumb not too moist or to dry)...and there is probably someone out there who would prefer a cake this way. If you want a traditional dark moist chocolate cake though STAY AWAY from this one!",
