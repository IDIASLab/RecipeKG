Thank you so much for putting this recipe on here!!! You made it possible for me to give my Dad a little bit of the past! If anyone is looking to try and make pickled eggs you gotta try this recipe....It's just to simple!! A few tips that worked for me were putting approx. 6 eggs in a small wide mouth mason jar and then pouring the mixture over them also i have been doubling the mixture i get about 4-5 jars that way also i dont use all the beets i just put as many of them that will fit in the jar, then i just let them sit in the refrigerator, my dad is my taste tester he said the best ones were the ones that were in the frig for 4 weeks the longer they sit they do taste better!\r\n",

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for and my husband just loves pickled eggs so I had to try this.  I made this a week ago and the verdict is in... (drumroll please). We have a winner!  He loved them and now wants me to make more (how many eggs can one person eat may I ask?).  I used 6 hard-cooked eggs vs. twelve because that's all I could fit into the jar, layering them with the beets, red onion slices, and juice.  I didn't change a thing with the mixture and let them set for one full week.  When we cut open the first egg it was a perfect deep reddish-pink color all the way through to the yellow yolk!  These are definitely worth the time to make!",
