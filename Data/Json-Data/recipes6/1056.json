The spice was just perfect for us and really had a great flavored soup base. Our guest don't eat spicy food at all and although they cleaned their bowls, they said it was a wee bit more spicy than they would make, but did like it. I didn't make the sour cream topping, since our guest don't really like cilantro, but it does sound good.",

I increased the chili powder and cumin to 3 tablespoons each because I like mine a bit more spicy. I always use Conecuh Sausage in my chili recipes so I added 3/4 pound of that, fried and cut into small pieces. I did not have fire roasted tomatoes so I used 1 can of regular Rotel instead. I could not find a Anaheim pepper so I used a Poblano pepper instead. I cooked this in my Crock Pot for 6 hours. Other than these modifications I followed the recipe as written. I considered my personal recipe to be the best out there but this one beat me hands down. It will become my new recipe from now on. Simply a blue ribbon recipe for chili.",

Everyone at the office raved about it.  It is hands down a winner and great tasting to boot.  I prepared all the ingredients and fried the meat and veggies the night before, placed all the ingredients in the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight.

Now I got the \"oh my gosh!\"... I'm also using Mexican crema blended with cumin and cilantro to drizzle across the top and I am deep frying thin slices of the Hatch chilis to garnish for texture.

I have been using a recipe that my mom used to make that I had tweaked over the years. But decided it was time to try something new as and found this highly rated recipe. \n\nWhen I showed this to my wife for an ingredients run she thought I was nuts trying to make what sounds like a very spicy chili. Well I made a couple of minor mods and was very pleasantly surprised. My slightly modified version will be my new go to for chili. All of my kids liked it over grandma's recipe ad did all of my employees. 16 servings gone in the first 24 hours served and lots of compliments. No one complained that it was to spicy. \n\nMade a 36 serving batch of this chili since I have so many  kids to feed and we like to freeze ready made meals. Since I have a variety of heat tolerances in my family I toned down the heat by only adding 1/2 of the chili powder  the recipe called for. Also omitted the tomato paste as there were several people who had gripped about it. I also added cubed steak, pork sausage and black beans. \n\nNext time I'll make a bigger batch :)",

Made exactly as directed (other than I only added 4 oz tomato paste)  To all the reviewers who modified the recipe  (other than the amount of tomato paste which must be a mistake), once you change the recipe, you are not reviewing this recipe  anymore, but your own modified take of it.  We want to know how this recipe is, not your version of it.",
