It is rather good not to sweet not to choclatey which brings me to wonder where the \"double\" chocolate cake name comes from. However I would like to note this recipe is a \"gummy/sticky\" cake. when cooling it on the racks it stuck to them rather badly because of the sticky texture. And for anyone who owns a train cake mold for their little train lover I will suggest this recipe however do not fill over 3/4 full as it will rise to much giving a fluffy bottom to your little train:) ALL AROUND 4 STARS THOUGH!!!",

Another plus for this cake is that it does not use too much baking soda. Please please have all your ingredients at room temperature otherwise you will have lumps of butter and chocolate. I do empathize with newer bakers because they probably did not realize that this is an absolute necessity (especially for one bowl cakes). This cake does work!!!",
