As previous posters have mentioned the cookie base can be difficult to work with but I recommend saving the lemon juice from the zested lemon and add as needed if the mix is too dry. Holiday Update I won the cookie contest at work with a modified version of this recipe using fresh cranberries and orange zest. Double the sugar you add to the berries since cranberries are so tart. Also added extra juice from the orange and orange extract to the cookie base",

I used my hands to mix up the course crumbs before forming it into an 8x8 pan. The crust was done in 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I added the filling and baked the bars at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The crumb topping was a nice golden brown color and evenly covered the bars. I could also see the blueberries bubbling with it's purple juices oozing out on the sides. I cooled the bars before tasting them. The lemon works beautifully with the fresh blueberries balancing out the tart with the sugar in the filling. This is not too sweet or too tart either-just right. The crumb topping has a nice sweet crunchy texture and works great with all of the blueberries. The crust is the perfect thickness just the way I like them. And I am glad I baked these in a 8x8 pan otherwise I would have ended up with thin crusts. The lemon zest adds a nice subtle lemon flavor to the crust as well. I cut these into 9 large bars and they were gone -just like that! Delicious and a great treat.",

Only problem is the oven temp and/or bake time -- my crust was done at 10 min at 400 so I lowered the oven temp to 350 to finish the baking and the bars were done in 15 (would have burned at 20-25 min at 400).
