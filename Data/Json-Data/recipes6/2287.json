We actually like to smoke our hams so my review is based on the glaze and not the cooking method. The glaze was amazing! It created the best \"bark\" of any ham I've ever made. The bourbon and horseradish mustard are dominant but blend absolutely perfect with the ham. This will be my go to glaze for ham from now on regardless of which method I cook it..",
