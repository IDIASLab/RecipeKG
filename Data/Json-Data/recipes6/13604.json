I don't have high protein wheat flour so I just used regular ww flour. I'm not sure if that made any difference or not but it really didn't get crumbly. I added wheat germ to get a bit of the texture of a graham cracker crust--about 2 tablespoons and I added about 3 tablespoons more flour than it called for. It also took longer to bake--about 5 minutes more but that tends to depend on your oven. I ended up with extra almost enough to make another pie so I'll find something to do with that. Thanks for the recipe!",
