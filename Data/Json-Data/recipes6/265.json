Next day ( game day )I continued to bake for another 6 hours on low, and then I added about 2 tsp salt.  ALL the excess liquid had been absorbed, the beans were tender.  Now I hate beans, I always have, but these were very good, and THEEEEEE hit at the super bowl party at the local VFW!\nGREAT recipe!",
