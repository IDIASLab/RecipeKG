I did not add the whole amount of salt called for just a pinch. The capers added an interesting flavor something I was skeptical about honestly. I can't say that we liked it or didn't. IMO it just made it saltier. This is a decent sauce but it really does need more spices. I think this is a sauce that tastes better the longer it sits so next time I'll make it a day ahead of time.",

Before serving I put the tomato chunks in a food processor or blender to smooth it out and even out the taste and acidity. The leftover sauce freezes/reheats quite well. My 1 year old gobbles this stuff up!",

Sauteed an onion & added 3 bay leaves. Guests asked for the name of the caterer that catered the party. That burst my buttons!! Half of the food was catered & I prepared the rest. This ones's a keeper. Thanks Angchick P.S. Forgot to mention that I also put some pork neck bones in the oven 350 degrees for one hour & then added them to the sauce while it simmered. This does make a big difference. I do this with all my tomato sauces.",
