I've made it twice and left out the brown sugar from the meatloaf itself the second time (not the top glaze though). Was still just fine, so that's one way to cut the sweet if you like. Truly if you try to substitute regular pineapple for the preserves, you'll be missing out. Reminded me of sweet and sour meatballs in a way, but not entirely. I didn't process mine just mixed by hand. Also, I always drain my meatloaves about 30 minutes into the cooking right before I top with the glaze.",

Tangy, moist & a sweetness that really adds to the overall flavor. \nYou will impress yourself & your fellow diners w/this one, especially if you're like me & can barely boil water unassisted :)",

As I can never leave well enough alone I switched out the ketchup in the sauce, and added Chili Garlic Sauce.  This was awesome!  Gave the meatloaf a sweet yet spicy taste.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  (Adjust Chili Garlic with ketchup depending on your fondness for spice)",
