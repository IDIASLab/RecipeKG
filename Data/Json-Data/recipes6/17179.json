I doubled this recipe to fill a 16 oz bottle.  I used balsamic vinegar which makes this extra special.  It seemed like the amount of oregano was excessive but really it is perfect once mixed and poured on the salad.  This dressing mixes and tastes best when the ingredients are allowed to \"marry\" overnight in the refrigerator.     Finally a wonderful salad dressing that tastes as good as any in an Italian restaurant - we loved it!  Update - Since I doubled the recipe, I used 1 tablespoon garlic salt and one tablespoon garlic powder which really gives this dressing a smooth taste with less saltiness.  After making this quite a few times, adding a bit more sugar will temper down the acidic taste.  I've also been adventurous and added dried, minced onion bits.  Yummy!",

Also, I suggest omitting the 2 tablespoons salt. You may want to add 1 tablespoon lemon pepper (not lemon pepper salt!) to increase the \"zest.\"\n\nExperiment with balsamic vinegar, fruit juices (orange juice is great with red wine vinegar) and flavored oils.\n\nSide notes: Blend the vinegar and 2 tablespoons mix and let sit for at least 5 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. This helps dissolve the individual spices and herbs.\n\nThe water is unnecessary. You only need that with the Good Seasons mix, for goodness knows what chemical reaction to occur.\n\nThis dressing will not stay emulsified (mixed) when stored in the refrigerator. Just shake it up well before use.",

I have used it for everything from marinading steaks to on popcorn.  I think it is actually more flavorful that the packaged kind.  I have not however tried to make it into dressing though.  The the reviewers that complained about the lack of zestyness I would suggest adding a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes to your dressing.  This should increase the zing.  Hot sauce also works, but you tend to be able to taste it more the the pepper.  I also decreased the salt by half.  I just worried that 2 T was too much.  I was right, the saltiness was perfect for us.  I won't be buying any more packaged italian dressing mix from now on.  Thank you Debby!",

I would say it would also be great for chips, or if you thin it with a little milk, it would make a great ranch dressing.  Again - I left out the salt.\n\n\nThis is the best, simplest, most useful & versatile recipe I have found for italian salad dressing on this site.  It is wonderful as is, and I have made it several times with modifications per our taste of the day. I've used olive oil, canola, red wine vinegar, cider vinegar, balsamic and combinations of these. I have also substituted salt-free seasoning (just the cheap kind from Big Lots) for the salt. These changes all work well.  Substituting Marjoram or Savory for the Thyme, celery seed for celery salt, 1/2 garlic powder for the garlic salt also works well. Sometimes I add a squirt or two of spicy brown mustard when mixing in the oil & vinegar.  Thanks for submitting it.",

The great thing about this recipe is it is a versatile Italian season mix.  I spooned out this mix into a cold pasta salad, and I spooned some into a homemade pasta sauce.

Use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut the salt way back (1 tsp. or less).  Second, I had problems with both the dry and liquid ingredients separating.  It's hard to combine the flakes with the granules.  The liquid ingredients wouldn't stay mixed together, so I used an emulsifier that I read about a couple of months ago in Cooks Illustrated.  I came up with this combination: 1 Tbsp. vinegar, 1/2 tsp. each dijon and mayo (the emulsifiers), 1 tsp. flakes from the mix, 1/2 tsp. granules from the mix, slowly drizzle in 3 Tbsp. olive oil while whisking.  This worked brilliantly and the dressing stayed uniform!",
