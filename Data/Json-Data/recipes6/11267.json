I don't know if I'd make it if I didn't have a glut of beets from the garden (like now) -- it takes so long to cook the beets -- but I will make this cake again. I decreased the oil by half and replaced it with apple sauce (I do this with all my recipes) and boosted the fibre a bit by using whole wheat flour in place some of the all purpose. (I hadn't done that with cakes before just breads and muffins but it worked out fine.) Hopefully that will shave a few grams off the per serving fat content while still leaving a delicious dessert.",

It's as delicious as I remembered it to be! I'm not about to lose it this time! By the way since I have to stick to a low fat diet because of surgery I made it with a 1/2 c. of oil and substituted a 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce for the other 1/2 c. of oil. It turned out perfect and every bit as delicious! The best part about this cake is it's always moist!",

I took other reviewers' advice and pureed the beets. I actually pureed the beets in the blender along with the eggs and oil - the result was intensely pink smooth and creamy. I then poured that out into a bowl and followed the recipe as stated from there. I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter except I used olive oil instead of reg veg oil and the result was fabulous. I made cupcakes and baked at the stated temp for about 18 minutes. Thanks! A gorgeous recipe! Update I made these a second time for my husband's birthday BBQ and two different people told me they were the best chocolate cupcakes they had ever had! Update #2 It's 8 years later and I'm still making this as my go-to chocolate cake! It is unbelievably delicious and always garners rave reviews. I just made it for my 3 year old son's birthday and everyone loved it. You will not regret making this recipe!",
