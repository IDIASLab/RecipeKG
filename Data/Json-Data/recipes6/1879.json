So glad Chef John has the recipe and video to explain how to make it.  I couldn't find the banana liqueur, but it still turned out great.  The flavor is like eating at a fine dining restaurant. We've made it a few times now.  \n\nWe have a microwave above our stovetop, so we have to be careful - we pull the pan away from the stove and use a long nose flamer to light it so the flame-up doesn't damage our microwave.",

Ice cream scooped out and in bowls in the freezer before dinner helped to minimize the timing between dinner and dessert. Our exception to following the above recipe was banana liqueur which we didn't have; Butterscotch Ripple Schnapps was the substitute. I'll possibly add a dribble of that over the ice cream when serving next time - to boost the yum factor. Really almost any flavored liqueur (or even vanilla extract) would likely work here. Perhaps we didn't wait long enough for the rum to self-ignite but we ignited it with a BBQ lighter to prevent the bananas from overcooking. Will try for more success on that part next time! Clean up was easy too. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.",
