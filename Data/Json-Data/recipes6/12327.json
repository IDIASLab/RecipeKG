Couple of changes - I didn't have salted peanuts but the unsalted worked just as great - also I added twice the amount of chocolate but I used chocolate chips. I think the extra chocolate made them have a smoother texture which helped them not taste \"grainy\" like most \"no bake\" recipes. Overall great recipe!!! Has definitely replaced my old one.",
