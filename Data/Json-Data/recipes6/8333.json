I bake this all the time even for our regular whole wheat sandwich bread just replace the flour with whole wheat flour and add 4tsp. vital wheat gluten and it makes a perfect loaf of soft (not dense hard and heavy) wheat bread. Also makes great whole wheat dinner rolls just make the same adjustments and form into balls (12-15 or more depending on size preference) instead of forming a loaf and then cover and let rise 20-30 minutes until almost doubled in size brush with egg glaze and bake 20-30 minutes or until done. I've even used the same dough (whole wheat of course) to make awesome whole wheat cinnamon rolls just use this dough in place of the one on \"clone of a cinnabon\" on this site for a healthier version of that yummy recipe and follow shaping and icing instructions using fat free cream cheese in place of the other in the recipe. I just love this recipe soooo many possibilities and it freezes well too... thanks Ione!!!",
