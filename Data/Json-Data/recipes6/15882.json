I think it's awsome, but a litte tip of variation for iced cap lovers: Instead of putting the coffee and milk mixture in a glass of ice, blend it in with the ice in a blender, if you have an ice breaker. The taste and texture are almost like the one at Tim Hortons. Try it, you'll get hooked and won't have to spend two dollars at Timmy's every morning.",
