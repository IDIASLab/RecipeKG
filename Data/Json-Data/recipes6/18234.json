So this time I doubled the butter (which is what i used instead of shortening) added an extra teaspoon of baking powder I also eyed my milk as the recipe suggested only adding enough to make it into a ball. I also left my sweet potatoes a little undone so i had little flecks of sweet potatoe pieces cooked nicely in the biscuits and cooked them a little slower on 375 instead of 400. they came out very nice and tender. yummy",

For some reason they didn't rise very much maybe I didn't bake them quite long enough. I used 2 med. sized yams (or sweet potatoes) and microwaved them until they were soft. Let them cool a bit and then dug out the potato. I added 1 Tbs. of brown sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I also used real butter in place of the shortening. Next time I'll try with whole wheat flour. Used honey cinnamon butter on top. Served with beef stew and rice.",

I use butter not shortening - after cutting in small pieces with a knife you just have to use your hands for several minutes and keep squeezing the dough to get the butter mixed in completely. Just keep going until the dough mixture crumbles are pea-sized or smaller. The biscuits are so much better if you add extra cinnamon sugar and raisins. Soak raisins in warm water for 8 min drain before mixing into the dough. I never cut the biscuits just use my hands to make small balls and flatten them.",

The flavor (per recipe without modifications) is well-suited to either serve as a sweet (with a glaze topping, cream cheese, or powdered sugar) or a savory dish (on the side with soup or chili). I doubled the batch and made one pan of thinly rolled dough cut with a leaf-shape cutter-- perfect size for snacking. The second pan I made the rolls as directed. Next time I will add some more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) and experiment with pumpkin as well. Thanks for the awesome recipe! I look forward to using it over and over again!!",
