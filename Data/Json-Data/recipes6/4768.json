        "description": "This is a traditional Southern dish for bringing good luck into the New Year, consisting of black-eyed peas and rice. Eating Hoppin' John on New Year's Day is thought to bring a prosperous year filled with luck. The peas are symbolic of pennies or coins, and a coin is sometimes added to the pot or left under the dinner bowls. Greens along with this dish are supposed to also add to the wealth since they are the color of money. Eating this the day after represents frugality and savings. You are supposed to leave 3 peas to assure that the New Year will be filled with Luck, Fortune and Romance. Serve hot with corn bread.",

Tanya, please, if you get the chance, include the crock pot volume in the recipe. I am an amateur at slow-cookers, but I do have one... I think it holds maybe 3-4 quarts. Weeell that was NOT big enough, so the change I made was obvious: I had to dump it all into a big pot and cook it on the stove. I did the usual, bring it to a boil, put on a lid and turn down the heat to low. It took about 2-3 hours roughly because I wasn't in any hurry and I wanted the flavors to blend well. I still just used one ham hock though I added 2 teaspoons of bouillon. Oh, and I used one bag of fresh cut collards to save effort. Nothing real drastic... except that I used brown rice. Since I was taking my time cooking it, the extra cook time for brown was insignificant and might help with that mushy rice problem (seriously? She threw away the whole thing because of the mushy rice?). But it's essentially the same dish, cooked on the stove because I am bad at volume. It beats a review by some culinary troll who never made a recipe but slaps 3 stars on it to tell the internet (at the expense of others) the shocking revelation that it's faster to open cans. Why were you even looking at slow cooker recipes? Next time, put your own recipe up legit and quit being a parasite.",

My changes were soaking the black eyed peas for 24 hours before. Threw it all in a a 3-4 qt crockpot the greens cook down plenty of room you just stuff it all in there) I would have used 2 ham hock instead of one for more meat. I put in some diced ham leftover from Christmas. I forgot to add the rice so I didn't have the mushy issue. I would just make it on the side to be safe. 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes is way too much. I only did a half teaspoon and that's plenty. I used chicken broth which gives more flavor than vegetable. It was easy fix it and forget it. Tasted even better the next day. Will make again. I used a sweet cornbread recipe as it contrasted nicely with the spiciness of the dish.",

Use spicy Kielbasa and make sure it stews for at LEAST one hour preferably 2 for the ham hocks. Might want to tweak the spices too.
