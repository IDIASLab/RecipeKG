Impressed with the all-day smoker taste after a few minutes on gas BBQ grill. Novice griller chefs: If moisture is a concern, don't panic. pour pineapple juice in a small metal pan, place grilled chops in pan, pour enough more pineapple juice to just barely cover them--and seal tightly w/ foil, place in 250 degree oven for 7-10 minutes. Take chops out pan and allow them to rest for another 10 min. before serving.",
