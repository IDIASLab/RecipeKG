Please note:  This is not a cakey recipe like a stove top pancake.  The batter has a thicker crepe-like consistency.  If you have ever had Dutch Pannekoken you will probably like this.  Be sure to add all the sugar (it won't need any syrup, just whipped crea and a dust of cinnamon), increase the cinnamon in the recipe as suggested by others.  I used tart apples from our own tree (about 3 cups sliced) and cooked them in the sugar mix for about 2 mins on the stovetop.  I only let the batter sit about 10 mins and everything rose beautifully.  If your pancake does not perform as expected, check the expiration date of the baking powder - if you don't bake a lot and use it up consistently it can expire and not work as expected.  Also be sure to use baking powder not baking soda! (LOL) I suspect that these might be the reason some did not get their pancake to rise.",

Anyone who is looking for a recipe similar to Walker Brothers Rest., this is NOT the same, but very good.  Another reviewer recommend the recipe from Cooks, but this one is far Better!!!!  I followed suggestion of using 2-3 apples(which is a must) and used 1 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, my husband does not like nutmeg.  If you are preparing this recipe with Granny Smith Apples, the amount of sugar is perfect or TBS less, it gave the pancake the nice crust.  Some reviewers suggest reducing sugar, I would only do this if you using a sweeter apple(see note below).  The butter could be cut by 3 TBS but I used the 1/4 cup(4 TBS) because my cast iron skillet was recently seasoned.  I am giving this a 4 1/2 stars.  I would definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!  *A mix of sweeter/tart apples are Jonathan, Stayman-Winesap, Cox's Orange Pippin, and Jonagold.  *Sweet Apples are Braeburn, Fuji, Mutsu, Pink Lady, Suncrisp, Rome Beauty and Empire.  I would definitely use less sugar with these apples, but go with the Granny Smith, you would probably would use little less butter as well.  My Suggestion, go with 2 Granny Smith apples.",
