Also this crust is over-baked at the suggested baking time I think that 10 minutes is more than enough. The second baking time which may be for the custard is also too long. After only 15 minutes the edges of my crust had already been burned. The finished flavor and look of the crust was that of cardboard. For a tart which relies on a good crust this was a bad recipe. Pitch the crust just make some custard and top with fresh fruit!",

The crust had a rustic flair with the brown sugar and cinnamon as opposed to the usual white sugar crust and it was a welcomed change. The filling is lighter than a typical custard and is enough for a thin layer as opposed to some tarts that seem more a fruit pie than fruit tart. All-in-all this is a nice change from my usual Italian \"crostata\" and was a hit for breakfast with the kids. I made this in the evening and refrigerated for the next day. I used some gelatine melted in lukewarm water brushed over the tart to keep the fruit from browning. Thank you Lorelei Rusco. We'll be using this method again.",
