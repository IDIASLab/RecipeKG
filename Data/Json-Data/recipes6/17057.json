Not only is the dough wonderful to work with, the frosting really does dry hard so you can plate them in layers and they do NOT stick together because of the frosting!  I am very pleased with these.  I just made footballs with brown frosting and white laces for Superbowl Sunday!  When you bite into these, the outside is crisp and they are extremely soft and almost cakelike on the inside.  Really, really great recipe!  I did add a little imitation butter flavor and a bit more milk to the frosting to get it to the consistency I wanted.  Glad I found this one!  It's a keeper!",

Use plenty of flour on your board, and you can softly brush off the excess with a basting brush. Just flatten the dough with your hands a little, and gently roll over it a few times. (Make sure you don't roll too thin) Something I feel makes these cookies so good is the butter flavored SHORTENING. Those who use real butter are not going to get the same results in texture, and it's not really fair to judge a recipe poorly if you change a main ingredient. Butter and shortening don't bake the same. These cookies baked wonderfully, tasted terrific and were easy to make. The texture is perfect, not too soft yet not crunchy. The frosting is delicious as well. Another tip- Use parchment paper and your cookies won't burn on the bottom (or brown much at all for that matter). I never make cookies with it!",

Once it was, I pulled off a small hunk and rolled out 1 dozen, while keeping the rest in the freezer. Make sure your surface is well floured, as well as the butterknife or whatever you use to scrape it up to put it on the cookie sheet.  The cookies held their shape well and taste good, nice and soft.  Oh also don't chill your dough in the mixing bowl, scoop it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a disc shape, so it chills evenly and is easy to roll.",

Crispy on outside cakey inside. I leave out the milk and use 1/2 butter instead of all shortening. I also use a butter frosting (powdered sugar milk vanilla and butter). Outstanding!!! People always want the recipe. Also I would suggest chilling AT LEAST 2 hours - much easier to work with.",
