I wanted something more savory than sweet and went with a previous reviewer's suggestion of leaving out the sugar. In addition I added more cumin salt and some cayenne pepper to bring out some savory flavors. I also put it in a pie crust. I liked the resulting pie but concure with others that this isn't a quiche at all. Also next time I'll mix the two layers together since I wasn't wild about how the textures contrasted when they were divided. Good base though from which to start. Perfect for autumn! Thanks!",
