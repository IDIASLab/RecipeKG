(or just poke a few holes and bake whole!)  Then you can just use a spoon to scoop out the soft cooked flesh.  Second:  Use the best vegetable broth you can buy.  It makes the soup.  Mine actually tasted better BEFORE I added the 1/2 cup of light cream.  Next time I'd probably leave it out or add less and use half and half.  Third:  Go easy with the nutmeg.  It is powerful stuff and not everyone likes it.  Can easily be added a tiny sprinkle at a time at the very end to individual bowls.",

(I only gave 4 stars because I think the recipe would have been semi-bland as written) I did roast my squash & then scooped out the insides...much easier than trying to peel it. I could hardly get it cut in half (with a  very sharp knife)...can't imagine trying to peel it.  I added half a golden delicious apple (pelled, cored & sliced) when I added the carrots & wish I had added the other half. I didn't add the squash until the carrots were done since it was alreday cooked. I also added a huge clove of minced garlic (threw it in when the onion was almost done). I used one cup of chicken broth I had in teh fridge & two cups of vegetable broth & I added a bay leaf as well as some cayenne. It added great flavor but I went a little heavy on the cayenne...it was just a bit too spicy. Used an immersion blender to puree (love that thing!) & I did add the cream, pulling it off the heat as soon as it was added, to keep the cream from separating.  I garnished w/ two long sprigs of chives crossed over each other w/ a small dollop of organic yogurt where they intersect. Grated fresh nutmeg over all...it was really, really beautiful. Debated as to whether I should top the dollop of yogurt w/ some of the squash seeds I roasted but decided against it because I didn't want to interfere w/ the smooth texture of the soup. Thansk  for a wonderful, seasonal soup PHONELADY55...we enjoyed it!",

Since peeling this squash is difficult, I followed another reviewer's idea and sliced the squash lengthwise, scooped out the seeds, turned face down in a baking dish, covered with 1 inch of water, covered dish with foil and baked in a 375 degree oven for 30-45 minutes. This made getting to the squash much easier than trying to peel and cube it! For the stock I used 3 cups of frozen juices I'd been saving up from leftover roasts and such. I'm not sure if this is what gave the soup such an incredible taste, but it was simply fabulous! I did use heavy cream and I would recommend this to everyone because tasting the soup before adding it and after, the cream just gave it the special extra touch it needed! I used an immersion blender to blend all the ingredients rather than trying to transfer to a blender. I highly recommend this soup! I don't typically get so excited over soup - but this was awesome!    PS: I had a small patty pan squash I also threw in there!",

I cook butternut squash (and others) by cutting them in half scooping out the seeds laying the halves on a flat platter covering with plastic wrap and microwaving for 10 minutes or so. Test doneness with a fork or you will see the shell start to collapse. Simply scoop squash out of the shell and use as you wish. Also if I want to cook squash cut up I use my heaviest knife to bully through it then the pieces are easy to peel with a large paring knife. Long live butternut squash!!!",

Lots of nutmeg, salt and cracked pepper. My additions to the recipe: 1 teaspoon minced garlic. 2 small peeled and chopped green apples (a good tart variety) and a splash of orange juice while cooking, about 1/4 cup of all natural, unsweetened juice - these add a brightness to the flavor, otherwise it could be a bit heavy and flat tasting.
