The second time, I used the leaves, and the bread turned out much better.  In fact, it won second prize at our local fair.  The bread was definitely different and not something I'd want all the time, but it would make a good bread for a tea or shower and definitely improves with strawberry preserves.  It's also firm enough to toast and smells delicious when prepared that way.",
