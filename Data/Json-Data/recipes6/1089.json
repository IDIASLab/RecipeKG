I really do love all the ingredients of this recipe but it just didn't come together for me. I used red bell pepper because that's what I usually have on hand. My bacon was thick-cut so I only used 8 slices and they got lost in the mix. I did cut back on the cheese and the onions and the oatmeal and that was my mistake because it didn't really hold together. The cooking time is way off as stated by others--there is no way a meatloaf can be baked in 15 minutes (mine took an hour). In the very end we liked the flavors and I really wanted to love it. I would love to sit at Hmiller's table for this because I bet she has the real \"fix\" on this meal!",

There were way too many onions and green peppers. I used one onion and only a quarter of a green pepper and that's all you could taste. I was wary of the 15 min cook time so I baked it with the thermometer in. In a 350 degree oven cook time was 50 minutes. Even then the meat was cooked but the onion and green pepper held some crispiness. I would recommend cutting back on the onion and perhaps eliminating the green pepper unless you really love it. Also saut\u00e9 veggies first. Now as I was making the sauce I gently simmered on medium and slowly added the cheddar. What resulted was melted but curdle-like sauce. The taste was not good. I ended up topping with catsup instead. Did I miss garlic in the recipe? If so my mistake as I think this would add a nice flavor to what truly are good bones to this recipe.",
