I also didn't cube the pineapple, I used the rings out of a can. I originally made just one batch but silly me didn't read the pan size and put it all together in a 9x12. So I made another batch to fill the pan up and baked a bit longer, more like an hour. I was completely ready for a disaster but to my surprise it was fantastic. Not dry, not too moist but just perfect. So double your recipe and stick it in a 9/12 to enjoy even more. Also give your mixing a lot of love. The batter is wonderful too. Lick your spoon!",

Really cream that butter and sugar, and beat well between additions. The batter fluffs up like a meringe, so don't expect cake-mix consistency. \n\nI did do some modifications. (I found the cake a bit DRY) Here's what I recommend:\n\n(1) Yes, REDUCE the topping butter to 1/4 cup. Cube it, put it in the pan, and put the pan in the oven while it's preheating. Save the step. Sprinkle with brown sugar and combine with fork. \n\n(2)Really pile on that pineapple: be generous in the size of your cubes because they'll shrink!! Don't dry the pineapple, let those juices soak into the batter.\n\n(3) Cut the flour 1/4 cup, and reduce baking time by 5-7 minutes. \n\nThis is a great recipe! So glad I found it. It will become a perineal favorite in this home. Thanks!",

I cut back on the butter for the topping by half, and I went ahead and melted it in the hot oven right in the pan, and then I went ahead and mixed the brown sugar into the melted butter.  I used canned pineapple rings and put marachino cherries in the middles of the pineapple rings.  Then I sprinkled a little bit of chopped pecans over that.  I cut back on the salt just a tiny bit because I didn't have unsalted butter and didn't want it to come out too salty.  Instead of milk, I used 3/4 cup of the reserved pineapple juice, which gave the cake wonderful flavor.  I beat the batter real well between each step and the batter came out real nice.  Oh, also I used cake four instead of all-purpose.  Lastly, I only had an 8\" round pan and I had a little extra batter, so I went ahead and prepared three custard cups just like the pan, and poured the rest of the batter in those.  The cake was done in about 43 minutes, and the custard cups were done in about 32 minutes.  I'm glad I put the custard cups in the other cake pan I had, because the the sugary, buttery topping came up out of the sides a little bit.  This is so good!  I can't wait to eat more of it!  :o)",

I used half of a 1lb 4oz can of pinapple chunks drained and crushed. Also going off of what someone else reveiwed I only used about 3/4 of a stick of butter rather than the whole stick.

I use canned pineapple rings, dried very well, and make sure the butter mixture is a good consistency (I don't melt it all the way) before spreading it in the pan--that way it bakes into an almost crunchy topping for the cake.
