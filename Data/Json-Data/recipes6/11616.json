The way the pumpkin mixture oozes into the ginger snaps it reminds me of a very fluffy banana pudding except that it tastes like pumpkin pie instead of banana. This recipe seems to be especially popular with children. I wound up having to use 2 pie pans for it though. It makes 2 pies or 1 very deep dish pie.",

I made it for a family dinner and coaxed everyone to try it - even the \"non-pumpkin-pie-eaters\" loved it! The filling fluffs up almost like mousse but is more substantial and has a marvelous lightly spiced pumpkiny taste. I would say the gingersnap crust MUST be used - for me it made the pie. I suggest buying quality cookies with lots of ginger (I used brand-name Mr. Christie Midget Snaps thin wafers) And next time I think I will even layer them a bit more to make a thicker crust. HOWEVER I am now signed up to make the pumpkin pie for my family dinners for the next 25 years...",
