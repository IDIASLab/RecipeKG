Unfortunately I'm not one of them. As a hint double the sauce and add the second half when adding the vegetables.",

There was not enough sauce the veggies were still raw when I was done cooking and the meat was very tough. What I did to improve this was added some water to the sauce cooked the veggies additonal time on the stove and put the roast back in the oven for 4 hours on 200. Chuck roast does not come out right unless you cook it until it falls apart. After I did that this was very good my family loved it.",
