I almost passed them by and I am SO glad I didn't! They're the best cookies I've ever eaten. The texture is perfect - just cakey enough to add body and richness but still 100% gooey moist cookie not cake or brownie. Not dry at all! I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to my first batch and it was too sweet - the recipe is perfect as it stands. My only change is to add 1/2 semi-sweet chips and 1/2 white chips for flavor and contrast. These will be a Christmas tradition in our home!",

I noticed that if I left them cook for 8 minutes they were more cakelike but if I left them bake for a minute or 2 longer they were more cookie-like. I also removed them right away from the pan. And to avoid crumbling I used a small flat edged metal turner and quickly scooped them up. The batter didn't look right (kind of runny looky) however they turned out AWESOME!",
