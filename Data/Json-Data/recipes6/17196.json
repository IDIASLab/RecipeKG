However about 10 minutes into baking them it seemed like there was way too much sauce and I was afraid they would turn out soggy so I took them out of the oven took the wings out of the pan and continued baking them without the sauce. They turned out great this way. I had to change the recipe to fit the amount of chicken I had so this could very well be the reason I had the problem.

I added dried (jarred) ginger and a little black pepper to the flour and more ginger to the \"sauce\" - I'd add even more next time. The wings disappeared at the potluck and I thought they were tasty. Just not sure I'd spend the time to make them often because it was time-consuming to cut apart whole wings and then fry them (my frying pan would only hold 4 comfortably at a time). But for special occasions or potlucks when I'm not pressed for time I'll keep them in mind.",
