I'm thinking that chicken thighs might be better suited to this red wine sauce for one thing. I also would rather use a skillet on stovetop to make this instead of the oven because I have a better handle on getting it done to perfection. There was a lot of sauce for this and because it is quite liquid I will thicken the leftover sauce when I serve it again. I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Ready Rice to go with this. Mushrooms would be a good addition too in my opinion. The flavor of this sauce is really good and I must admit to having used grated fresh ginger. Dinner was successful and when Hubby likes something I feel grateful! Thanks for the recipe!",
