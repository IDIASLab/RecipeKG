You'll get a better rise out of your whites (& won't have to whip it as long) if you whip the whites to a soft peak first then gradually add the sugar. I cooked mine on an aluminum baking sheet so I added 10 minutes to the cook time. I let it cool in the oven for two hours & it was still too gooey in the center. I was barely able to grab a pic before the pile of cherries I put on top caved in the pavlova.:o( There's another recipe on this site that calls for the pavlova to be baked @ 300 degrees for an hour...that one worked much better for me. I'll use it again next time but thanks anyway Christina!",

I've never had Pavlova before only the crisp-all the-way-through type of meringue so I'm only guessing that it turned out correctly. It was crisply dry on the outside with a marshmallowy soft center. I made some temperature adjustments for my convection oven and once the Pavlova was done I just turned the oven off and left it in the oven until completely cool. I followed a comment on another Pavlova recipe by that said to only slightly sweeten the whipped cream for topping the dessert. The sweet of the meringue and the tart of the fruit and the barely sweetened cream are in balance that way. (PS- I asked a Kiwi friend about how it is supposed to come out and he said that soft but not runny in the middle is correct and that they almost always cave in on top when you put the fruit on it.)",
