I'm amused by the people who make vast changes to this recipe, and then complain that it didn't turn out the way they expected.  Ummm...try following the recipe!  And if you don't like pepper, maybe something called \"peppercorn steak\" won't please you...If you like classic French peppercorn steak, this is the recipe for you.  Cook it EXACTLY as described in the recipe.  Cooking this sort of steak in a frying pan is a wonderful change from the grill!  The sauce is fabulous.",

I cooked the steak as directed until they were as desired (medium) did the brandy trick then removed steaks and continued from there instead of removing later. The one gripe I have: all the comments about 3 foot high flames. What proof and how much extra brandy are you using?? There is no poof and maybe a 4 inch flame. I got my buddy to come check out what I was doing only to sorely disappoint him with lame pyrotechnics. You guys sure you didn't mistakenly drink all your brandy and drunkenly add grain alcohol as a substitute??? EDIT: lol... Ok I was a little harsh with the flame effects. However I have found the trick: The liquid needs to reduce to very minimal levels compared to the amount of brandy added. With a higher ratio of brandy to wine sauce you have a MUCH better flame which not only adds to the effect of cooking the meal but also singes the fat and adds a great flavor.",

I softened the onion & garlic before adding the liquid's to the sauce and cooking it for about 15 mins. The sauce got nice and thick and the flavour was delicate but beautiful. It worked tremendously well with the peppery steak. I think I will add some mushrooms to the sauce next time to soak up more of the yummy flavour. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also used coarse ground pepper instead of the crushed peppercorns. I used bourbon instead of brandy which worked just fine. Make sure you use a household lighter (the torch kind) to light the steaks or else you'll set your hand on fire. I served this with boiled spinach and balsamic red potatoes to absorb the extra yummy sauce. My husband was very impressed! A! Thank you so much!",

I skipped the salt sugar and shallots and added extra wine to make the sauce stronger in taste and added also extra brandy simply for maximum effect. Although the black peppercorn is an excellent ingredient may I suggest capers as a possible replacement for those who don't like their steak too spicy. Safe to say I will definitely make this stunning recipe again. Congratulations to the creator of this tasty dish!",

The only variations I used were course ground instead of cracked pepper the addition of a 1/2 cup of Shitake mushrooms skipping the sugar and setting aside the steaks to make the sauce - I returned them to the pan for about 2 minutes per side before serving.
