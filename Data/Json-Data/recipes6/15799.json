I omitted onion and used less mayo as others stated and used 1 cup crackers and 6 T parmesan. I do have an easier way to peel butternut squash for all you lovers out there. Wash and pat dry your squash. Take a fork and pierce the skin many times all around. Place in microwave and nuke for 8 to 10 minutes. Depending on size. Remove using a pot holder because it will be extremely hot. Let cool a few minutes before peeling it's easier to slice too it works great! Then procede with whatever recipe your making. Hope this helps.",

Replace the mayonnaise with vanilla yogurt and make it slightly less than 1/2 cup.  You could also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.\n3. Replace the saltine crackers with Graham crackers\nThe result is a sweet, vanilla flavored dish that lets the natural butternut squash flavor come through!",

I also did double the topping and saute the onions in a bit of butter before but everything else just as is. My roommate can't stop eating it! I seriously think she ate half of the dish! A great way to use up butternut. oh and i did bake the squash in halves in 350 degree oven for 1 hour before scooped it out and beat everything together with a hand-held mixer to combine. Great recipe!",
