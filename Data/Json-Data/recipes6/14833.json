What you actually do is cook all these ingredients on the stove top and then add them to sterilized canning jars. Then the easiest way to can is to put these in quart jars, preheat oven at 170 and let cook for 2 hours and then turn off oven and open doors and\nlet cool naturally. As the jars cool they will pop and seal. Very amazing. Much simpler than a water bath and just as safe. You can only use this for fruit or tomatoes, not meat or vegetables. Remember if the jars don't pop they aren't sealed and you will have to toss that jar. However, I have yet to have this happen. They always seal. Enjoy",

That won't stop us from enjoying this great pie though! I strained all the canned items before including them. Once it was cured I baked it in a pie shell for 30 minutes at 350 F. Don't let the idea of canning scare you away from a good recipe. All you have to do to sterilize your jars is wash them in the dishwasher then be sure not to touch the insides with anything that isn't sterile. There are a lot of good resources on the web that can help you.",

The filling recipe seems like it would be hard to mess up. I was worried earlier that I was spending a lot of money on dried fruit just to have it come out bad but thankfully it does not seem to be a concern. I also agree with other comments - NUTS.COM does have very high quality product and quick delivery. My only recipe change was replacing water with apple juice. Thanks for sharing this recipe Linda!",
