Since I couldn't find my mom's recipe I decided to look for one on here and I remembered that mom's had lemon juice in it and so does this one! I decided to give it a try. I left out dipping them in the egg white and walnuts which was fine. I filled them with apricot preserves and they were great! When I was finished making these they tasted just like my mom's recipe! A few minutes later I found her recipe... and this one is a whole lot easier cheaper and tasted the same! I will be saving this for a long time!",

I used finely chopped peanuts/flaked coconut/ and crushed Crispix cereal for the coating. I also put a chocolate chip in the center of each after five minutes of baking but I think the lemon/raspberry flavor would be better (Gasp!!) without the chocolate. I DO like the coconut being in the crunchy coating though. We'll do these again. Oh...I also like the relatively short list of ingredients and how these \"present\". Very pretty cookies.",
