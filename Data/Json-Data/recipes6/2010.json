I tried the pearl barley version in a rice cooker so I wouldn\u2019t have to watch it so carefully but it made a mess!  (Got thick and boiled through the vent). Nice flavors, easy to customize with your favorite dried fruit (I added some dried cranberries the second time as suggested by another reviewer) and/or nuts. I\u2019m happy to find a good way to use barley and an oatmeal alternative.",
