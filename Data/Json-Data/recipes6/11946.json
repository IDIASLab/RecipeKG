My husband couldn't believe that I made them fortunately he came home just as I was pulling them out of the oven so he knows it's true! I was worried after adding the egg that I did something wrong and kept re-reading the recipe as the \"dough\" was so flaky and wasn't holding together. I just kept at it and ended up using my hands to push it all together. It took a good 10 minutes of continuous kneading to get it right. Next time I will use just less than 1 cup of flour to see if that helps. Very simply ingredients. This recipe just produces 10 finished cookies so it was a good test run. Next time I will double/triple the ingredients to get a good batch - especially with the holidays coming up.",
