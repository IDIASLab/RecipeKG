I had two pieces of this right out of the oven and I could only finish part of them. After my brother lost his homecoming game last night in a miserable defeat, a slice of this phenomenal cake cheered him right up. This is a SPENDIFFEROUS recipe and I'm never trying another for zucchini cake again. Thanks for sharing Ani!",
