But next time I'd try omitting the baking soda and doubling the baking powder to see how they turn out. Blueberries and baking soda often equal green and I think the combo of the blueberries in the applesauce and the soda made for an oddly forest green muffin. But they are bursting with blueberry flavor and this recipe is otherwise a keeper. Very easy to make very delicious muffins.",
