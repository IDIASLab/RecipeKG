I tasted the marinade before adding the shrimp, and added a little more ketchup and brown sugar, and a wee bit of Worcestershire sauce.  When husband was finished with his part of the cook, I put the shrimp on our cast iron griddle.  They took just a few minutes on each side.  I think maybe I could have pulled them a minute earlier, but it was my first time grilling shrimp, so I wasn't sure.  ~~ They were really tasty!  Even my husband, who says he only likes battered, deep fried shrimp liked them.  We will try this or a variation again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!",
