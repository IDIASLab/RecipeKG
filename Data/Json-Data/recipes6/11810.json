Couldn't try one myself since I gave up sweets for Lent but Hubs said these were a \"mature cookie \" and his staff said they took Rice Krispies to a new level with the walnuts adding a nice crunch. Update 10-23-13 from my original Feb. 2008 review: I made these again today and this time it's not during Lent! Oh my goodness what a cookie. It's bakery-style pretty first of all though I made them bakery-style size! The cookie is buttery light tender and a little crispy. They have lots of texture and lots of flavor from the oatmeal nuts coconut and Rice Krisipies. I waited far too long to make these a second time!",

I wrote the first sentence after the first couple of batches came out of the oven. After a bit I started varying things and by taking out the cookies while they were still quite light in color they were much tastier. So either my oven runs hot or the recipe has them in for too long BUT if you don't overcook them these ARE a decent cookie and you can make A LOT FAST and PRETTY CHEAP!)

I thought they might be a little under baked but after sitting for a few minutes they were quite good. I tossed the first batch that baked for 15 minutes - way too long for these cookies I found. The texture is good and chocolate chips add a nice sweetness that the cookie seems to lack otherwise. Not my favorite but a decent cookie and a hit with the kids.",

Everyone who tried these cookies loved them. They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The crisp rice cereal give the cookies a great texture. I subbed sliced almonds for the walnuts as that is what I had on hand. I baked one tray without nuts for my son and then added the nuts to the remaining batter. The batter is very soft in fact I thought I had missed a cup of flour so I did a test bake. They came out perfect so it is just a soft batter not the cook!
