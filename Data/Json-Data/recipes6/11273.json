I've been using this recipe for a couple of years since our son is allergic to red dye (which ironically, is in almost all commercially prepared yellow cake mixes).  I have made the basic yellow cake and also the pineapple upside down cake version.  DO NOT use the shortening - use oil instead, and you will get a much lighter cake which is not dry and dense.  I have tried it with shortening and with the oil, and hands down, the oil version wins.  I also increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup (or 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup pineapple juice if using the upside down cake version).  VERY good with the tweaked changes, so I'm going ahead and giving it 5 stars.  Hope this helps.  :o)",

I just tried the white cake variation, except I used oil instead of shortening and I used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  I recommend using cake flour as I makes it more fluffy and tender.  If you're going to use all-purpose, sift it, then measure it out.  This takes care of the density problem some reviewers have had.  Also, I didn't follow the directions.  When making cakes, you don't want to disturb the flour too much, otherwise it forms gluten strands which toughens the cake, and it comes out to be more like a bread.  Here's what I did:  In a large bowl, combine oil milk and vanilla.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks are formed (room temperature is best). Gradually add flour mixture to wet ingredients until just blended.  Fold in egg whites and pour the batter into the dish immediately.  Mine baked for about 30-35 minutes.  Combining the ingredients that way made it come out tall, fluffy, tender, moist, and full of flavor!  ",

To some of the reviewers who have had trouble with the cake being dense, try beating it slightly longer than specified...also I usually make the white cake and beat the whites separately as suggested, that makes it fluffier.  I also usually cook it in a loaf pan, but if you're using a flatter pan (13x9) I find it's better to lower the temperature somewhat to prevent the edges burning. A great basic recipe, though, and it's even low-fat!",

That said I had to change many of the ingredients (added an extra 1/2 cup of milk an extra cup of sugar an extra egg one extra tsp. extract used cake flour and used 1/2 cup oil instead of shortening). With these changes the cake had a better texture and flavor. Also I mixed the wet ingredients THEN mixed in the dry until everything just came together. If you over mix the texture won't be right.",
