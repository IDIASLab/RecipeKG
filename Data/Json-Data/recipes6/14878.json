I've been making it often as my house is for sale and it gets the house smelling just wonderful for people walking through.  It's very adaptable too.  I like to add a touch of cinnamon and vanilla to it and often substitue other fruits for the banana.  This morning I used 1 banana, 1 peach and a 1/2 cup of shredded zuchinni and a handful of raisins.  Yesterday it was 1 banana and 1 c of zuchinni.  Before that it was all zuchinni and a 1/2 c  pineapple and raisins.  This recipe hasn't failed on me yet!",
