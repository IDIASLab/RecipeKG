First of all, that 'S' shape looked like a pain to make, so I took a melon ball/ice cream scoop, a very small one and using a level scoop, plopped them on the baking pans.  Then, using the bottom of a glass, dusted in a little powdered sugar, squashed them flat, to about 1/4\".  When they were baking, I melted white chocolate and kept it warm.  When the cookies were room temp, after baking, I spread the bottoms with white chocolate and put two halves together (like an Oreo).\nThen dusted the final cookies with the powdered sugar by sifting it with a fine mesh strainer.  I know this is a far cry from any Greek type cookie, but these were really delicious, my husband's new favorites.  Oh and I made them later using raspberry seedless jam on one side, and white chocolate on the other half, then put the two halves together, those are his new favorites.  I used good chocolate, Lindt.  Excellent recipe.  I double the amount of vanilla and almond extract that the original recipe calls for by the way.",
