This winter warming vegetable soup is called flag soup because when you cut the vegetables up it makes the colors of the Irish flag. The French call it 'mirepoix,' the Italians 'soffrito.' Either way, it makes a lovely soup for those chilly winter days. Serve with crusty bread rolls.",

I added it because the submitter says 3 TBSPs....but I think it's wrong. The sage is way way over powering and pungent and you could taste the sweetness of the carrots over it which made it rather a weird soup that was in-edible.
