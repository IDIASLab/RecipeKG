First of all I could barely taste the chocolate or peanut because of all the butterscotch! The butterscotch chips were so rich that next time I think I'll cut them down to a half cup. Also I would suggest doubling the peanut butter. I couldn't taste the chocolate either so I added a cup of cocoa which worked well. I'm not even sure that the chocolate chips are necessary. I probably would've given this recipe 3 stars because of this but as I said the texture was so good.",

So I used up some left over heavy cream and half and half that I had. Also had not semi-sweet or butterscotch chips only milk chocolate. So I used 2 cups of milk chocolate and it turned out great now more of a peanut butter/chocolate fudge. I have a candy thermometer but if you don't just use the cold water trick. Check the consistency about 3 minutes into boiling that is normally when it hits the 'soft ball stage.' One other thing that I changed was instead of spraying the dish I lined it with wax paper so I could easily pull the fudge out to cut plus easier clean up!",

Checked for the soft ball stage after approxiately 2-1/2 to 3 minutes at a full rolling boil...perfect. Got rave reviews from everyone. Great flavor really nice texture. The butterscotch does slightly overwhelm the chocolate but we were looking for something different from the usual chocolate fudge. As another member mentioned this is very sweet but fudge is supposed to be sweet or it wouldn't be fudge. Will definitely make this one again!",
