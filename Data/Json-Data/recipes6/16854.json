The biggest problem I found was that amounts of the ingredients to accomendate covering 12 boiled eggs in pickling sauce doesn't cut it. if you look at the photo of Chef Luigi and the eggs in the container you will see eggs don't have enough covereage. So solution is double all ingredients except the eggs and you will have eggs that get properly seasoned all the way around. But to say the least hubby liked it very much. I made them for him I tasted the yolk and it reminded me of mustard. But I like mustard so it was good for me. And being the 1st time pickling eggs I think the recipe was rather simple and quite at putting it all together. I will say no where could I find tarragon vinegar so it resulted in me following McCormkins label and adding try tarragon to a pint of white distilled vinegar and I let it set for 3 days before using it to make this recipe. I don't think I'd do anything different other then doubling the batch for this recipe to cover the 12 eggs.",

I used this recipe for a guide and with out it I would not have had really good first time picked eggs. I am sure thar if I had all the required ingredients and did not make so many substitutions I would have had GREAT first making pickled eggs instead of just really good. I only had distilled vinegar so I used that. I did not have celery seed so I used caraway seed instead and I added three sprigs of fresh dill weed to the mix and boiled then simmered and cooled as directed. They turned out rather well that way.",
