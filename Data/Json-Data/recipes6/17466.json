I skipped the cutout part (too time consuming) and just formed the dough into two logs about 2-3 inches wide. When it was chilled I sliced it into 1/8\" slices. I baked it on parchment for about 9 minutes. These would be perfect with coffee or to make your own ice cream sandwiches. Thanks!",

Make sure you use only room temp softened butter, measure the exact amount of ingredients (no eyeballing it) and chill the dough for 2 hours. TIP! Cover the dough in wax paper in the fridge during chilling. After you pull it out, roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper. You have no issues with sticking, flour doesn't mar the pretty brown dough. \n\nThanks for sharing your Grandmother's recipe! She was a great cook!!\n",
