She recommends using the vanilla bean as the recipe states but a couple tsp of vanilla or almond extract can be used in its place, depending how strong you want the almond/vanilla to taste.  As another reviewer also stated, brandy is a good sub for the vodka and to the reviewer wondering about the bottles, the recipe says to fill 2 26oz bottles...should be glass.  What type of bottle you use doesn't matter.  However, my friend likes to find odd and unique shaped bottles and will decorate them closer to xmas time.  Just make sure they're cleaned well and that you can close the caps tightly!",

When I first made this, a month ago, I never could find espresso powder. Instead, I used coffee extract, the whole bottle, which I believe was about 2 ounces. Also, I used 3 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I put the whole concoction in a large mason jar with a tight lid and sat it on a shelf in the garage for a month. I poured it into my fancy glass decanters (it filled up two of them), and my husband and I enjoyed our first little glass of it last night in front of the fire while watching \"A Christmas Story\".
