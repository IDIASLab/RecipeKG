Make sure you use the recommended size pan and you should be fine. I do not spread the PB on the cake while warm but wait for it to cool and set up. Then I micro the PB for a few seconds to make it a bit runny it is much easier to spread it this way. Allow that layer to set up and then spread the melted chocolate layer. It is a time consuming recipe because of the cool down times between layers but is well worth the effort. Received the biggest compliment the last time I made it for a party... I brought home an empty pan.",

I think the recipe calls for too much milk, because the batter was like cake mix, and not like cookie dough. I think I whipped the eggs and sugar too long, but the \"cookie\" part was like a cake, and a very spongy one at that. It took well over half an hour to cook at 350 degrees. When I took it out at 20 minutes, the peanut butter broke through the \u201cskin\u201d and sunk. It seemed like cake with peanut butter and chocolate on top. Is this recipe supposed to be cookie-ish or cake-y? I didn\u2019t like these very much and probably won\u2019t make again.",

There seems to be a little confusion about what these are supposed to be - they're kind of a firm sponge with peanut butter and chocolate on top. Next time I would probably go slightly heavier with the peanut butter. And I think I'd use milk chocolate rather than semisweet. The sponge would also make a very good Boston cream cupcake if the sponge were split and filled with pastry cream. I'll definitely make these again:)",
