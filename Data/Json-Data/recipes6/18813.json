If I wanted somebody to remember me for my waffles this is the recipe to do it. Sweet but not too much so....liked it better with with a drizzle of light corn syrup than the maple syrup (of course butter). Next time I will separate the eggs and whip up the whites separately and fold them in at the end to see if they would be more airy and lighter.",

They looked and smelled nice but the taste was lacking and the texture was way too chewy. I can't imagine if I had made these on a traditional waffle iron where they would have been thinner -- they would have tasted like rubber -- or a hockey puck as another reviewer mentioned. They were way too heavy and had little flavor. If you've ever had a good waffle these are unacceptable. Sorry Jim!

You can always just plain use milk and skip the powdered milk and water problem.
