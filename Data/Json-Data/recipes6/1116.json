I loved all the added aromatics and flavors however this was a little sweet for my tastes. Next time I would cut back the sugar to about 1 cup especially with the additional sugar in the apple cider. Just be sure to rinse with water thoroughly after removing from the brine and to use KOSHER salt not table salt.",
