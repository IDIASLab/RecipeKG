I took Snocu's advice from the reviews and did not melt the butter, but sliced it thin and made a layer over top.  I added fresh lemon juice from half a lemon and a bit of nutmeg to the berries.  I also used Betty Crocker's Moist French Vanilla cake mix.   My husband and children DEMANDED that I make it again!  Thanks!",

Many blueberry recipes include lemon juice, so I figured this would be alright.  It tasted fabulous!  I can't imagine it without the lemon cake mix.  Also, several of the reviews on this recipe complained about the topping so instead of melting the butter, I used my food processor and cut cold butter into the mix.  That way it would be evenly distributed.  Instead of a 9x13 pan, I used 2 glass pie plates and divided the ingredients equally.",
