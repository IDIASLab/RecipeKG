When done I cut a slice of the bread and the top 1/3 was chocolate colored (like a brownie) and the bottom 2/3 was GREEN. It was the exact tone of green as a Florist's styrofoam block that they stick flowers into. Needless to say it was not appealing. Also the texture of the top was cakelike but the bottom was overly moist (almost mushy). Maybe I didn't bake it long enough. I am thinking that it was from the coloring in the Chocolate Pudding I used. I threw it away as it was too scary looking to eat. I did try a taste and it seemed okay. Curious to see if this has happened to anyone else?",

First of all I don't use Amish Friendship Starter...I am way too lazy for that. Instead I just use 1/3 C. of milk, 1/3 C of flour and a 1/3 C. sugar mixed well. That is my substitute for the starter mix. I also added 1 T. of cocoa, 1 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 bag of dried cherries (approx. 1 1/4 C.) and I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract. The bread turned out great, we call it Cherry Chocolate Bread. YUMMY!",

My Qualitycook friend Mandy had made it last year and she wasn't impressed with the taste. With that I decided to look for something to doctor it up. I was a little confused about the pudding amount so I used two 1.4 ounce packages which made it nice and chocolatey. I also threw in a goodly amount of chocolate chips and topped it with powdered sugar. Oh and I only used one loaf pan and it was perfectly done in 50 minutes. For those who've never tried this before this is more like cake than bread. Anyway Kathy it's delicious and I was very happy with the results. Thank you!",
