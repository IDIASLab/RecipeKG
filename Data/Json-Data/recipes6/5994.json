Would make this again with some changes. Oh by the way the 15 minute prep time is ridiculous. If you add the pepper blackening time ( I would use my BBQ next time) cooling and peeling time it took about 45 minutes. I made it exactly to the recipe and it was way too spicy hot to eat and we eat Mexican all the time! I thought Hatch Chiles were like a California Chili used in Chili Rellanos but they are more like large jalapenos. My hands burned all night from peeling the burnt peppers. I always use sweet onions but a neighbor had given me a regular onion which I used and that just made it hotter. We ate what we with rice and chips but threw the other meal or two we could have had away. Will use 3 (not 5) Poblanos next time and a sweet onion and I think it would be very good. Could add some cheese and more crema and it would make a hearty dip.",
