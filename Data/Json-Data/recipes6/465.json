That was a good call because it was still a very subtle flavor. Because of the weather I upped the flour by another 1/4 Cup also and believe that it was perfect. Used a cookie scoop for uniformity baked for 15 minutes exactly. Once cooled I did dip half the cookie in melted chocolate and topped some with the toffee bits and others with almond slices. A very nice addition to the holiday cookie round up. Thanks for a great and easy straightforward recipe.",
