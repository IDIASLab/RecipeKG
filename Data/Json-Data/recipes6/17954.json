(2/3 cup of light cream.) Second time it came out so incredibly creamy amd caramelly. So perfect that I will never use any other recipe fr tgis fudge. Make sure your pot is big and heavy. Watch your candy thermometer closely and don't try to get it to the soft ball stage as quickly as you can. I turned my knob down a bit once it started to boil and let it bubble slowly. It came out just unbelieveable. You must try using just light cream....no milk....and use 2/3 cup. Whip it very well with a large heavy whisk when you add vanilla, and you will find it to be like caramel when you pour it into your pan. UNREAL!",
