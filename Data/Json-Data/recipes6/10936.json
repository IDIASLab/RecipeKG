When I was a child, one of my neighbors who was elderly made a lot of wedding cakes for family and other people, and she took great pride in her work.  She used fancy staircases you get in cake decorating stores, and even crocheted certain decorations.  All is in your imagination.  No professional baker did what she did.  Be creative.",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks Carol for this wonderful recipe. I made this wedding cake recipe for a wedding celebration for one of my co-workers. Everyone raved about it. They liked that it was a very traditional wedding cake. If you are old enough to have gotten white wedding cake in a cardboard box to take home from a wedding then you know what I am talking about. The cake is dense yet moist. It was very easy to cut to create the tiers. I used non-melting wax paper instead of parchment paper since I couldn't find parchment paper - it worked fine. I wouldn't call this cake \"plain\" but rather elegant and simple it has a very slight fruity taste to it. I recommend you buy the shortening (Crisco) that is not butter flavored to keep the cake very white. I also made the ornamental icing but did have to add a bit more cream to get it smooth enough. You definitely need to use a large mixer rather than a hand-held to mix the frosting. The ornamental icing recipe frosted the cake decorated it and still plenty was left over. My friend decorated it and the cake looked gorgeous.",

We live in China and I had to bake it in an impossible tiny oven and it still was moist and delicious!!! Only one problem-there is no way that 3 tiers of 5 8 and 10 inches add up to 150 servings. DO the math! Most cake pages will tell you that at the most an 8 and a 10 inch put togther will give you 30 servings add the 5 inch layer and I am mystified that you get to 150 servings. Perhaps if you make 4 of them! I used the 150 serving recipe to make 2 9x13s with 32 servings each (about a 2x2) but you could stretch that to 48 each for a total of 96 servings-max! And that would be a very tiny serving. Why would you want to serve a postage stamp slice of this delicious cake? I read the other reviews but was puzzled that no one else commented on the portions being wrong. Would love to see how anyone got 150 servings out of this. Liz May",

I marbled my cake and the white/chocolate blend was just right. there was enough batter to make 2 full 8\" cakes and the 10\" as the recipe says. We tried some of it the day it was baked and it was a bit dry and bland. The following day we tried it again and what a difference!!! The extra time allows the full flavor to come through. The cake was layered with chocolate ganache. Then topped with another layer of ganache striped with white chocolate and trimed with almond buttercream roses. ABSOUTELY MARVELOUS!",
