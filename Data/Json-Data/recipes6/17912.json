I don't know pears very well and I used d'Anjou pears if it matters. I microwaved this for a total of 8 minutes before I tried it. I'm not sure what kind of consistency I was supposed to look for - it certainly wasn't jam-like and the \"shreds\" were still pretty noticeable. Maybe I should have cooked it even longer in order to transform the consistency. Anyhow I tried this on both cake (a pretty plain vanilla ring cake with a little glaze) and on ice cream (French vanilla). It was a pretty tasty accompaniment for both (especially when warmed up and put on the ice cream) but nothing spectacular. But I think I'll still make this again since I have more crystallized ginger I want to use up.",
