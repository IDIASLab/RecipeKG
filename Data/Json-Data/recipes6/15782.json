It left out a very important step such as DON'T STIR THE MIXTURE AFTER IT BOILS OR IT WILL NEVER THICKEN!!! I found this crucial step in other recipes after waiting for the mixture to thicken. This recipe has potential to be good because it seems so easy, and it is, if it wasn't for the lousy lack of directions.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe more than once! Candy making is not forgiving a candy thermomorter a must! if you under do it is sticky if you over do it is rock hard. Try using this recipe with red hots (a bag) to flavor and color unstead of red die. makes the flavor good. also can add a little cherry extract. taste like the fairs. Let the candy thermomorter read about 260 than turn heat down to cook rest of the way. this receipe can burn in a half of second after hard crack ball stage. must watch. Also don't kid yourself candy making is dangerous I burned myself trying to save my expensive pan. Heat and water don't mix. I went into the hospital  and had my baby that night with a burned scar on my hand. So don't do like myself and have a bunch of screaming kids at the table. the less distraction the better. Oh must have apples layed out on wax paper. use popsicle sticks unstead of the pricy apple sticks. spray wax paper with pam. after apple is dipped and dry use a cheap sandwich bag and tie off with red or green curling string. To remove excess wax peper off apples use a clean new wet rag. To clean pan pour excess syrup in some old crisco can or something you will throw away. soak your pan in dish liquid and water. Recipe is a keeper once you've mastered it. This receipe is not your every day and is very tricky but well worth it! so go ahead and charge like the fairs. or give away. Most likely will ruin a batch or two. but once you've found your magic stick with it! well good luck!!!",
