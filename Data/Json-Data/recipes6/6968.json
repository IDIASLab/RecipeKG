I tasted the butter/soy sauce combo (I TATSE EVERYTHING!) before applying it to the salmon it really was delicious. No need to brush the sauce onto the salmon it's not thick like BBQ sauce. You can just pour it on. It's gonna run off anyhow. I coated the fish with lemon pepper maybe i should have just lightly sprinkled. The recipe doesn't mention any flipping so being a man obsessed with computers photography and not cooking I naturally didn't flip it either. It began to get black on the top after about 5 minutesin the broiler. I told my wife and she asked me when I flipped it. HAHAHA So i flipped it. The blackened portion was actually tasty the lemon pepper was lemony and i enjoyed the fish. However it came out of the pan with all kinds of unattractive blackness on it and it was on the greasy side. I'm gonna try it again changing the following: Unsalted butter instead of brummel less lemon pepper A dash of olive oil added to the butter/soy mix before applying to fish",
