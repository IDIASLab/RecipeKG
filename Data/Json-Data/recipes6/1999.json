I'm sure it was my fault but my pastries all broke making a big mess--I was trying to follow the pastry recipe tips and this one at the same time and I think I rolled the dough too thin or tried to add more filling that would fit (probably both). Nonetheless my family still liked them quite well. Despite my lack of proficiency I thought the sauce could be a little thicker and it would have worked better and I also thought it was too tart. I'm sure I'll try this again as my hubby has already requested it; but I have a really good pie crust recipe and I think I'll try that instead of the puff pastry add more sugar and cut down slightly on the liquid.",
