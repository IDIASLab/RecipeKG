For the dryness that everyone spoke of, I added two extra tablespoons of butter, extra cheese, and cooked for ten minutes less than suggested.  For the blandness that was mentioned, I added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt and 1/4 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 cup of freshly grated dubliner cheese (like a sweet, bold paremsian cheese).  Pair with a nice fruit salad and it would be a perfect brunch, will definately make again. Thanks for the new recipe!",

I chopped up bacon and cooked till crisp drained off grease added the chopped drained spinach to the pan added pepper pinch of nutmeg and smallest pinch of crushed red peppers. drained well on papertowel. Mixed all ingredients as directed but added garlic powder and salt. Scooped heaping tbs to greased muffin pans and baked. They made 9 muffins. I added the bacon to balance the spinach and give the recipe more flavor as well as the wheat flour for texture. the nutmeg added wonders since it goes so well with spinach! MMMM they smelled heavenly in the oven and looked marvelous. The only critisism i have is i didnt really like the \"stringy\" texture the spinich gave them but the flavor was ok. Maybe next time i will use green onion or chives. Oh yeah 35 mins was way too long they were done in about 20 mins. They were a little dry too but they were ok. Not sure if i would make again maybe try fresh spinach. N R",
