Lost a star because this does NOT make enough to feed six people. 1 and 3/4 c of diced chicken was approximately 1 and 1/3 chicken breasts for 6 people? Even with the broccoli, it\u2019s not enough food to be a filling meal for six adults. It makes enough sauce, so next time I will just add more chicken and broccoli, maybe a tad more cream cheese to stretch the sauce. Recipe is excellent and delicious though!",

Next time I will make sure I use unsalted butter in the pan, and I may even need to make ranch dressing from scratch to reduce the sodium. However, the chicken, cheese sauce, and broccoli was fantastic! UPDATE (6/8/20): I made this again but this time omitted the salt from the recipe and used unsalted butter. It was better, but it still seemed salty to us. Next time I will make ranch seasoning from scratch.",
