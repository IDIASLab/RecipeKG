I found that if you rolled them too thin they didnt puff up they ended up flat but if you rolled them thick enough they turn out fine. As far as taste I just added a bit more vanilla then it asked for and it was fine. As far as tasting too much like flour I can see that happening if you use the four cups and add the whole other two or as much as recipe submitter has to use when she makes them due to her humidity. I used the four in the beginning but only used one cup at the end. I left my dough a little tacky but made somewhat of a ball out of it while tacky then dipped the ball all sides into some flour that I had on the table worked it in a bit then rolled out on floured surface. That seemed to help out with the over flouring. So for me I liked this recipe and it turned out great cooking is all about experimenting and tweaking till you get it just the way you want.",

I actually sat in front of the oven and watched them puff. They taste great better with frosting. Totally easy I did not even follow the recipe perfectly! I used butter instead of shortening regular milk instead of sour and cinnamon instead of nutmeg! They key is to add flour but just enought to keep from sticking to the table and not to roll them too thin then they come out perfect melt in your mouth soft!!!",
