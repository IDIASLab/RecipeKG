I thought it was just chocolate, but it turns out it also has a creamy hazlenut ingredient.  Anyway, the raw dough tasted EXACTLY like Ben & Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  I baked the cookies too long (a common problem of mine) so they were a little crisp once cooled, but my husband loved them and we think they'll go great with ice cream.  Will definitely be making again.  Oh - this doesn't make 3 dozen cookies....MAYBE makes 2 dozen...but more like 15 - 18 regular sized cookies.",

I was looking for a basic chocolate cookie recipe and found this one deciding to try it even though it made chocolate chip cookies. Instead of using SOFTENED butter I completely MELTED the butter in the microwave. When you mix the chocolate chips with MELTED butter they melt making the dough brown and chocolaty. When you bake the cookies they will be chocolate instead of chocolate chip. That is my trick for making chocolate cookies! Thanks for the recipe Barb!",
