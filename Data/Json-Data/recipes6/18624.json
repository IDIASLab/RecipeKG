I also don't keep pumpkin pie spice so used my usual spices for pumpkin pie: cinnamon ginger cloves nutmeg. Per 1/2 cup of pumpkin it's 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of the remaining three. I like this recipe. Good toasted for breakfast. Try it with something along the lines of cinnamon-honey butter. It's also good if you want to toss in dried fruit (cranberries dates or raisins) and chopped toasted pecans (or whatever nut you prefer). I'm definitely keeping the recipe. It worked very well on the white bread setting. I admit to being somewhat confused about why the directions give the option of either the basic or the sweet bread setting. This is not a sweet bread recipe. na ja.",

A carpenter with an electric saw would have been great. I had the biggest Squash to work with a monster. A friend did the shopping for me that's how I became the proud owner of an eight pound butternut squash yikes! I read all the recommendations on how to cut/prepare butternut squash and not losing my fingers. These are some of the recommendation; -Cut into three pieces -cut lengthwise - bake for an hour - cook in microwave -cut a hole or -and something with paper towels They all sounded daunting and even dangerous to me goodness probably they work well with small Butternut Squash but mine was from a different universe. I couldn't decide so I decided to try the first suggestion; cut length wise. Mercy Thelma-Louise! I couldn't see this eight inch long eight pounder cut lengthwise. I don't have a knife that long and am just too old to play with knives and oversized squash. Just considering that adventure made me shudder. On to the next recommendation: cut into three pieces then cook in microwave turning the squash every three minutes. fo",
