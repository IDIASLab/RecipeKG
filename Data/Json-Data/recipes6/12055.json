They are wonderful.  Three baking tips:  as one reviewer suggested, use parchment paper...they'll be even more perfect!  Chill the dough just a bit before dropping them onto cookie sheets.  They won't spread thin. (Because of the butter)  Lastly, for perfectly round cookies that are all the same size, as odd as it sounds, shape them into squares that are 1 inch on all sides, and maybe 1/2 inch on top and bottom.  They'll look like they are tall, but they *do* come out perfect.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an \"okay\" cookie with the potential to be better, but as written only merits three stars.  Some reviewers were disappointed that this cookie turns out flat and some of the submitted photos illustrated that. That didn't appeal to me, so in an effort to eliminate that problem I used half butter/half shortening, added an extra 1/4 cup flour, made sure not to over-cream the butter and sugar and chilled the dough for about an hour.  I was tempted to reduce the amount of butter too and ultimately wish I had, because the cookie still turned out flatter than I would have preferred.  Noticing this was missing,  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt and I can't imagine how flat tasting this cookie would have been without those additions. The cookie is light and crispy/chewy, with a mild cinnamon and molasses flavor - four stars with my changes.  I'd call it an enhanced sugar cookie.  Not a bad tasting cookie at all, but if you're looking for the cookie to reflect its name I'd increase the cinnamon significantly.   Bottom line, I suppose I could play around with this even more to resolve some of its issues, but a good, well-written recipe should require no changes.",
