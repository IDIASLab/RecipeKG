I also made some other changes and thought they were good. For the berry mixture I only used 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 c butter (1/2 stick). For the crust I only used 3/4 c milk and 3/4 c sugar instead of the 1 c the recipe called for. I thought it was great and so did the whole family! We're looking forward to making it again with some berry alterations (adding blueberries or strawberries. Great Cobbler Recipe!! Thanks!",
