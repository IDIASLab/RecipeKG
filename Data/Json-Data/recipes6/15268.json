I learned it with some different proportions and directions including cooking the dollops of egg white for a few seconds in boiling water turning once and removing with a slotted spoon (similar to go away's directions). It's very easy and gives the islands slightly more structure (without making them crispy). My recipe also does not add any sugar to the egg whites and even though I am a sugar fiend I still love it! Just make sure there's a little custard in every bite.:)",
