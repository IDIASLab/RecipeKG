Get it? If you want a vanilla-pudding-with-rice-in-it type of pudding, USE A DIFFERENT RECIPE! Don't waste everyone's time complaining that this recipe isn't like that. The lady (with all the yes votes) who says the recipe is wrong is totally out to lunch - the changes she suggested would change it to a completely different recipe. That said - this recipe is delicious - I put a little cinnamon in it and nutmeg on top. Good warm or cold - also good with milk or cream poured over. Brings back childhood memories from the South.

This is the dry, baked style, which is very different from the wet , creamy style.   This is the kind I grew up with, and the kind that is served in old Southern cafeterias.     It is supposed to be baked until dry.   It is a great way to use up leftover rice.   \n\nI made this with 3 cups leftover cooked rice,  followed the recipe exactly , except added cinamon, and increased the raisins.   It was great.   Exactly what I wanted.   Serve warm with a little cream,  or cold.....",

One style that is generally preferred by African Americans and quite a few southerners.  It is a baked pudding MEANT to be dry and thick enough to cut into squares if you wanted to.  It is a thick baked custard base, most often served warm.  Then there is a pudding the rest of the population prefers that is a type of creamy vanilla pudding base with rice in it, usually served cold.  If the latter is what you seek,... THIS AIN'T IT!!!  Go to a different recipe.  This recipe mirrors what I grew up understanding to be rice pudding, but may not fit the bill for you if you grew up on the other kind.  Probably if you grew up eating one of them, you'll HATE the other.",

I only changed it a little bit to make it taste like my great grandmothers who was born and raised in Mississippi and will turn 108 this October. Cooked the rice in milk, butter and 1/2 cup sugar. I used 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 cream, 2 tbsp butter, I only had cinnamon and increased the sugar to 1 cup. This is a very southern traditional rice pudding not the soupy/creamy kind they make in northern states. My kids loved it so much they took some to school for their snack. Not for dieters that's for sure. Works well with soy milk for those who are lactose intolerant. I used vanilla flavored.(second try) Oh and don't forget to spray or butter the dish!!! I will certainly be making this for my Big Momma as a birthday gift. ",
