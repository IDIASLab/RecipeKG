I did use two cans of evaporated milk (the reason why I did this is because canned milk has always turned out a better outcome in the crockpot over \"fresh\" milk--I didn't want to worry about scorched milk and Healthy Choice cream of mushroom soup. Though we ate it, we all thought that the cream of mushroom soup flavor in this soup was off-putting and really didn't seem to belong. I think that ruined this recipe. I'm not much for low ratings as it breaks my heart to do so, but really......for us it wasn't good. I think if it was omitted, it would have a much better outcome. I'm very sorry.",

If I would have had more time I would cook it on low for probably 8 hours since I used regular potatoes but I did it on high for 4 and low for 2 and it tastes awesome!  I did add a little velvetta I had in the fridge too. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Lunch this week is going to be tasty! Thanks Michelle!",
