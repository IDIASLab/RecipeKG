I think I will try mini chocolate chips or chocolate shavings next time.  Also, I \"wetted\" the chips then put them in with the flour mixture before mixing in with the wet.  This coated them and helped to prevent the chocolate from falling to the bottom. These muffings are also wonderful with homemade cream cheese frosting!\noops one more thing, I found 400 was too high and burned the outside.  375 for 20 minutes was perfect.",
