I season the chicken with oyster sauce and some cinnamon. We also add cashew nuts and use mixed veggies, not just peas. Our favorite restaurant adds some cherry tomatoes, but we're not whole-tomato-people in our house, so I skip that part, although tomato lovers might find it a good addition. Also, I get pineapple chunks in 100% pineapple juice, and when I drain the pineapple I DO keep the juice. I then mix up about half of it with the soy sauce and add it to the rice. We rather use a bit more soy sauce and less (or no) salt. And finally, a trick I learned from my mom: I don't use the sesame oil to stir fry. For that I use regular vegetable oil or cooking spray made of real oil. But I do sprinkle sesame oil at the end, for better aroma.",
