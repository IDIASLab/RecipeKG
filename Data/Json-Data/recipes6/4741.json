The avocados were a great addition to gazpacho. I also used REALLY good quality olive oil; it added a wonderful richness to the flavor. Best if left to \"set\" overnight; the cucumbers soften up a bit more. But super easy and oh so tasty. Would serve this as a beginning soup to a nice meal for company anytime.",

I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and add a pinch of chipotle flakes. Next time I want to add a spring of thyme basil and I can't wait to use fresh tomatoes.
