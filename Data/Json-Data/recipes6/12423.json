In my test batch (1/4 of the original recipe yield) I substituted freshly squeezed orange juice for half of the milk. Also I just brushed the cookies with the whites from the egg yolk instead of wasting a whole egg. However I didn't really understand what shape these were supposed to be and I ended up making a rather odd looking thing. For a few of them I rolled them into balls and flattened them slightly making nice little round cookies. I put an almond in the center of some. For my next batch I plan to make them in the shape of crosses for Easter; my mom suggested that I make them with lemon which I may try also.",

I also kept unused dough under a damp cloth. Even so the dough often crumbled just as I was getting my roll to the right diameter. And boy did it take a long time to roll all those cookies. I'm still not sure I understood what the shape was supposed to be. In the end I thought the cookies tasted pretty bland for the amount of work involved but my kids swear they are fabulous. My 1st grader promises they taste just like the cookies his Greek classmate brought in. Go figure.",
