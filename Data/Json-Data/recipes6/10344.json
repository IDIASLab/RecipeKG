And once it's toasted, it's out of this world (slice it thick b4 toasting). The sweetness is sublte onced it's done - just how we like it.  (Similar to sweet Hawaiin bread)  I use either currants or small dried blueberries. I think raisins are too big for this bread. I've also used this to make french toast.  Slice it then let it sit out for a day to get drier.  Taste and texture is like brioche. I've also added a little buttermilk or milk, whatever I have one hand, when my dough is a litte too dry About 1-2 tablespoons at most. (1 pint sour cream = 2 cups) Tip- cover tightly with foil after it's done and let it steam for 30 min. or longer.  This will lock in the moisture.  A trick for all loaf breads.",

This is moist and dense and has a lovely texture. I added 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds and shaped the loaves into freeform rounds on a greased baking sheet (wet your hands with a bit of cold water to facilitate shaping). I also used a pastry brush to apply some melted butter halfway through the baking time. The breads were golden and crusty and absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again - and not just on St. Patrick's Day - as a base for bread pudding. No caraway seeds, of course. :)",
