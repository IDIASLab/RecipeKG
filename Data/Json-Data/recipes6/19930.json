Was sure it wasn't recipe at fault but the reviewers as most probaby don't know what a SPONGE/FOAM cake is, nor do they understand the concept of mixing procedure, texture & very light flavor of THESE cakes.  It IS NOT a American heavy textured/flavored cake. I'm a profess. pastry chef/instructor. I make these cakes everyday/know the texture & very light flavor of these cakes are what makes them special. Sponge-type (also known as foam) cakes, depend on beaten eggs for their light, airy texture, the mixing & folding procedule is VERY important as the batter can deflate before it even goes into the oven. Because it has no butter/oil it is lighter in texture, the flavors are very slight. They DO NOT require a frosting, only a little Whip Cr. & fruit. Think of it as Angel Food Cake. I wk in an Asian bakery, this is like our cakes only sweeter.  Made this w/extra TBL of expresso & cocoa. Baked in 8\" Springform pan-3\" hi. Rose 2 3/4\", deflated (which is what they do) to 2 1/2\". Removed deflated sugary crusted top, split cake. Lined pan ring with acetate strip, put 1/2 cake in bottom of ring. Cut strawberries in 1/2, place along edge of cake, filled center w/whip.cr & sliced strawb. Added 2nd 1/2 of cake, piped whip cr. on top,added fresh strawberries. Removed pan ring to display cake. It was beautiful & declicious. THANKS for sharing recipe. Important & recom. all read about Sponge/Foam cakes to understand them.",

I increased the cocoa powder to a heaping tablespoon, Instead of chocolate flavored liqueur I used one tablespoon of good quality vanilla. Instead of espresso I used 1 tbsp of Nescafe crystals and 1 tablespoon of Kahlua. There was enough to fill both pans. I think the main reason people don't like it is because they don't know how to separate eggs or to beat whites to stiff peaks. I used superfine sugar and eggs at room temperature. Overall it's very satisfactory and only needs to be baked for 15 minutes at most! I used a chocolate ganache on top and a vanilla whipped cream to sandwich the two cakes together. Everyone loved it.",

I doubled the sugar and put in more than double the original amount of coffee and cocoa. Everything else I did according to the recipe. It came out nice and spongy and the family liked it although the recipe only made enough batter to fill one cake pan. Nevertheless I thought it was tasty and made a good spongy cake and it wasn't hard the next morning. I'm going to try it again with even more sugar and coffee next time.",
