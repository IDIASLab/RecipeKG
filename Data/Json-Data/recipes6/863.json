When I come home with a big pack of chicken legs, the family knows what's coming.  I marinate for at least 24 hours, turning once, and then bake uncovered in a 350 oven for 2 hours or more.  Note:  I make a double batch so the legs are just about covered.  A few nights ago hubby was really late coming home from work and the legs were happily cooking for two and a half hours.  Oh, my...!  My oldest son couldn't stop saying, \"Mom, look, the meat is just falling off the bones!\"  Followed by yumm, yummm, yum noises.  Ok, Broomcladdad, that to me is a great compliment.  The last batch I made I tweeked your recipe and added maybe a 1/4 cup more soy sauce and a smidge more brown sugar.  I love sesame seeds but have to leave them out.  Hubby and I have bridges, and I'm not talking about those in Madison County either.\nNext month, March 2014 my father-in-law is turning 75.  Guess what my mother-in-law wants me to make for the main course for his birthday dinner?  Job well done!!\nMargie Bayer",

I added 1/4 C molasses (a secret Japanese ingredient) and 2 more Tablespoons of brown sugar (it wasn't quite sweet enough for my taste) totaling 6 Tablespoons as well as a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I did not double the sesame oil because it is so strong so I substituted olive oil up to 1/4 C total. Again these extra ingredients were doubled!!!  This was delicious...enjoy!",

Used fructose in place of honey balsamic rice vinegar a ton more minced garlic and added a big splash of sherry at the end. Did not add cornstarch or cook it as I have found if you keep basting your food with its own juices along with the marinade while it's baking the sauce thickens on it's own. Fabulous as it keeps forever! /arnetage68",
