I agree, you do have to love peanut butter as it is very rich.  I read others saying it fell apart on them, but what I did is mix the ingredients in the morning, put the batter in the fridge and when I got home that evening, I baked them.  I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar which I think gives it a better consistency.  They came out perfect little (slight) mounds.  They do need to be rolled into small balls, about 3/4\".  I've made this recipe a few times now and what I do if I don't want to bake all of them, is keep them in an airtight container and just bake as I want them. I've kept the batter in the fridge for as long as a week.  This is the PERFECT easy, gluten free cookie!",

I agree with the other person who said they were so peanut buttery she had to drink a whole glass of water after eating one.  Eating one of these cookies was the equivalent to eating a spoon of peanut butter!!!  They were also dry and crumbly..  I won't make this recipe again.  I am a peanut butter cookie connoisseur and would much rather take a little extra time and make a cookie that tastes great..",

I rolled the dough into 1\" balls and then flattened each with criss-cross fork strokes.  I believe that cookie size is critically important to this recipe.  The recipe states it will make 3 doz. which it easily does with a smaller size.  Flourless cookies are very rich cookies, and require a scaled back portion. (It is similar to the reduced portion size for flourless chocolate cake compared to traditional chocolate cake.) The cookies baked up nicely in about 8 min. The result was a golden brown, crispy petite peanut butter cookie.  Thanks Vicki.",

These are great cookie for those suffering from Celiac Disease or those who have gluten sensitivities in general. Many people can't tolerate regular flour, so these are a great alternative. Are they the best peanut butter cookies ever? No, definitely not, but they are delicious for what they are, most people have these ingredients on hand, and they are really easy to make. As far as cook time goes, I would follow the directions on the recipe...I like ooey gooey soft cookies, and I had to cook these above the 8 minutes. I would check them at 8 minutes and see how they are. Mine didn't even brown on the bottom at all and they were in the oven for at least 10 minutes. Everyone's oven is different, so I would recommend following the instructions if it's your first time making them.",
