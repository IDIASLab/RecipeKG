You will be adding more than 4 cups of flour.  6 is more like it.  I have made this in all seasons and more flour is needed.  The proofing is a bit odd but it does work just fine.  Sprinkle, do not mix.  Leave alone for 5-10 mins until dissolved. then proceed with the 1/2 cup of flour, cover with plastic and let sit 30 mins.  The milk portion only needs to be dissolved. Now beat your sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Add the milk portion then the 'starter' you proofed for 30 mins.  Use a second bowl to cut the butter into the flour.  Do this by cutting the 12 tbls of butter into 1/2 inch cubes and toss them into the 3.5 cups of flour.  Now use the paddle and mix on slowest speed and mix until it looks like crumbs. Now you can add the egg mixture then up the speed for about 3 mins.  Your mixer will freak out a bit but add the fruits and now add more flour until it leaves the side of the bowl.  Sticky is ok but it needs to look like bread dough and not cookie dough.  Proof, punch, divide, shape, place into pans and proof again.  ",

Yes, It need salt 1 1/4 tsp for 4 cups flour. Also the instruction are bit complicated. When I do mine put the flour in the center of the table open the center and add the liquids, yeast and eggs mix a bit with some flour to make a soft dough almost creamy.. Sponge for 30 min. Add the sugar, egg yolks, soften butter, and flavoring like vanilla, zest. Make a soft dough and let double in size. Add the fruits. Put in the mold and do a X cut on top.
