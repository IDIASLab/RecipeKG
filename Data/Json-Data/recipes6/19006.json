Each bowl was a different flavor. After the cheesecake had cooled and was ready to serve I melted 3 squares of semisweet chocolate with 2 Tablespoons of butter and 1 teaspoon of shortening Cool for 2 minutes and pour over the cake letting it drip a little over the sides. Melt 1/2 ounce of white chocolate with 1 tsp shortening and drizzle over the glaze. That seemed to change the cheesecake from looking a little drab to one for a special occasion.",
