It's definitely not the over-dense, over-syrupy-sweet American flan, this is real, fabulous flan.  It's sweet without being overpowering, and holds together tightly without being dense.  It's light and beautiful when it's done!  Definitely party-worthy.  I did make some changes: (1)Doubled the recipe and used 8 eggs (didn't differentiate between whites and whole eggs).  (2) Added 2 t. of vanilla.  (3) Put it in two large ceramic dishes. (4) Added 1 c. of heavy cream (1/2 c., if you didn't double the recipe).  It turned out absolutely marvelous!  I'll definitely be making it again.",

I followed the recipe (adding NO vanilla) and both my husband and I thought the caramel flavoring was all it needed.  I had no problem melting the sugar.  Just remember to use only medium heat so it doesn't cook too fast.  Thanks for a great, simple flan recipe!",

The 2 changes I made were to add butter to the melting sugar, 1 cup sugar to 1 Tbls butter. This helps it to not turn hard immediately. Second I traded 1/2 the milk for heavy cream. It turned out better then my usual kind. This is out new \"Family and Party Favorite\"",
