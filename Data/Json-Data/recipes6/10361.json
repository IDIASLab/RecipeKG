This recipe seems to fall in line with sugar and oil as most other quickbreads but I personally feel those standards are too sweet and too oily.  I cut the sugar in half and used 1.5 cups of yogurt in place of some of the oil and added just 4 tablespoons of oil. Also I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups of AP flour.  Let me tell you, I make QB's all the time and these were light and fluffy, almost like a cake and they were delicious.  I love cooking with pumpkin and always looking for new recipes. In case someone follows my lead, I didn't add water till the very end to thin out the batter and it only ended up being 1/3 of a cup.",
