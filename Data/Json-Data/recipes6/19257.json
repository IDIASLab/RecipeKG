This is what we call fudge in my country (Trinidad and Toabgo) First I halved this recipe for two reasons - 1. the amount it claims to make and 2. the bad reviews but I was really craving this sweet and hoped it would turn out like the type I buy here. First I left out the ice bath step and followed the recipe using the stove top instead of the microwave and I let it cook on low heat till it reached 240 degrees on my candy thermometer. I swiftly removed it from the heat and added in 1 tbsp of butter (yes I put in more butter if making the full recipe I'd use 2 tbsps) and the maple extract then took my whisk and put my strength into it and beat it for about 1 -2 minutes till it stopped looking like caramel and more glossy and thick. From here it is race to pour it into your waiting dish cause it starts to set up almost immediately! I scored my fudge and left it to cool for about an hour at room temp. and it is perfect! Exactly what I wanted. Smooth melt in your mouth delicious fudge! Now my beef with the serving size - I got way less than this recipe says unless you are cutting this the size of mints maybe. I will be making this again and the full recipe too! Thanks for sharing.",
