I had a full pork loin that I cut the two ends for pork roasts and used the middle section to make a very large batch of pulled pork.  I made as written and plugged the crockpot in Friday night when I went to bed.  We woke up to an incredible smell on Saturday morning.  I saved the broth and shredded the pork.  Since I was giving part of it away, freezing some and serving some I did add part of the drained liquid back in the pot.  The bbq sauce was added at the time of serving as not all wanted sauce.  This was fantastic and I will certainly make it again and I've already shared the recipe, twice.  I paired this with 'Citrus Jell-o Salad' and 'Twice Baked Potato Casserole from Crisco' both on AR.  We had cole slaw on the side to add to the pork,  if wanted.   My parents joined us for dinner to see our son before he left for TN. (5-stars)",

The rub was the best combination of spices and sweetness that I've come across yet, and I've been looking and trying recipes for a LONG time.  My search is over!!  Not overpowering or overly spicy.  I'm sure you could add additional spice or sweetness to it, but this base is your perfect starting point!!  I used a 7.5 lb fresh picnic with the bone, I heaped the measurements of the RUB INGREDIENTS ONLY,  except the salt and pepper, for this size  pork and cooked it in slow cooker on low from about 2 p.m. through the next morning. I did retain 1 1/2 cups of its own liquid and it was delicious. (Anything over this size of meat, I would definitely double the rub ingredients but not the liquid.)  I heaped it on home-made mac & cheese, lightly mixed a bit of our favorite BBQ sauce in it and stuck it under the broiler about 5 mins. to heat and crisp up the sugars! \nIT WAS HEAVEN ON EARTH!!",

I did not use the bbq sauce at the end, instead I mixed in some of the cooking liquid. No idea how much, just until it looked really moist.  Personally I thought this needed a touch of liquid smoke and more heat (so I would give it four stars), but my family devoured it, said to rate it 10 stars  and threatened to revolt if I make changes. I served it on butter toasted sliders with Cilantro Cole Slaw (from AR) and regular sweet Cole Slaw.  Those that prefer sweeter meats liked it best with the sweet Cole Slaw, but others (who like savory better), preferred the Cilantro Cole Slaw.",
