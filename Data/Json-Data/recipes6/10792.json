Mine took 1 hour and 10 minutes with no raw center. It was light fluffy and moist. It's perfect for stawberry shortcake and the slices freeze well. Be sure to whip the egg whites until they form stiff white peaks - it makes a difference. I couldn't believe how light and fluffy my pound cake turned out because of it.",

I followed the recipe exactly and yes the egg whites must be whipped to form soft peaks don't leave out any of the steps and you will be happy with the results. I used a Pyrex 8x4 loaf pan and baking time was 1 hour and 20 minutes just make sure you test it by inserting a toothpick in the center of the cake and if it comes out clean then you can be sure the center is not raw. This cake is delicious thank you for the recipe!!",
