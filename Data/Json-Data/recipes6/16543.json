Add 1 cup of this Indian Relish to 8 oz of cream cheese (mix well) and you have an amazing dip to serve with Wheat Thin crackers!! You can add crushed pineapple or pecans for a different flavor. This recipe makes 3 cups which is probably a great amount served by itself but definitely would half the mixture if you plan to mix with Cream cheese as this recipe will create 3 batches of Cream Cheese Relish Dip. When I made the relish it did not thicken so after an hour of simmering on the stove I added 2 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in 2 tablespoons of water and it thickened right up! This is a must try Relish and will be great for any occasion.",
