I made it for a church Christmas bakesale and my husband wouldn't let me take more than 1/2.  I like the fact that the pieces aren't huge, just about 4-5 inches long when the logs are sliced horizontally.  The only changes I made were from earlier reviews, adding about a cup more flour, using almond instead of anise (didn't have anise), and using entire container of fruit (2 cups).  Not only for Christmas around here!!",

I made them as the recipe called and also with white chocolate along the bottom. I loved them either way. I brought some to work and they were a big hit with my co-workers also. The dried candy was a bit hard and chewy. Not sure why that happened or if anyone else had this problem. Thanks to others who told that the dough would be very sticky. I was prepared for that and therefore was able to work well with it with a little more flour. I used just enough to be easier to handle and tried to handle it as little as possible as not to dry them out. Thank you for this recipe. I will make these again and again!",
