I had no problems with it being dry and the texture was excellent even with the changes I made: 2 Tbs. ground flax seed mixed with 6 Tbs. hot water for the eggs applesauce for the shortening 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white and 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup all-purpose. These made it a little healthier and I did not add nuts (as per my family's liking). It did not need the frosting either. The only thing I would watch out for is that the longer it sits the spicier it gets. My 15-year-old brother loved this cake (even when he found out there was tomato soup in it) and my father ate a whole big piece (a first for my \"Internet Recipes\")!",

The only thing I did different was to cut the recipe in half as a 9 x 13 pan wouldn't fit in my RV oven. I am giving this a 4 star review because the texture is crumbly. Thanks for a great tasting recipe!",
