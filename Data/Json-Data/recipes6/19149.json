Thank you for this wonderful recipe!I always get a nice thick chewy cookie with consistent results everytime. I don't care for raisins, so i have never used them, but always add toffee bits instead for wonderful results. I am not understanding why some of you are getting a flat cookie, but what i do is just make sure i always use butter, make sure it is not too warm, and i never measure it out because 1 lb is 2 cups..no need to measure. I also always make sure to use a shiny aluminum sheet pan (which almost always gives the best results for cookie spreading),and i top it with parchment paper instead of greasing the sheet. I typically use a #40 scoop for reg size, or #20 for jumbo cookies. I Bake them just until set, and they are the perfect size and texture. HUGE seller. Good luck!",

I had a friend who made these for Bunco one night and she said she makes a batch of the dough rolls it in saran and freezes it. Just slice and bake. There was absolutely no difference in flavor (I have had these so many times I'm definitely and expert...) and the texture was perfect. As another reviewer said these cookies ROCK! I normally make them with heaping tablespoonfulls so the cookies are very large but if you want to freeze them you can make the rolls of dough to be whatever size you want.",

They were even better when I put the extra dough in the fridge and cooked them a day later without letting them come up to room temp. They set up thicker this way looked and tasted much better. I do this with cc cookies too--cook them after 24 to 36 hrs in the fridge makes a world of diff in the cookie.",
