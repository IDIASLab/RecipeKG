So I used everything included here but instead of  BBQ sauce, I used about a cup of vinegar and cup of beef broth.  But most important, I put the insert in and placed the meat on top of it so it is not soaking in liquid.  Then I lifted it out and shredded the pork in a bowl and added a small amount of liquid back it.  Much more control.",

I would cut back on the water next time, as I had a lot of liquid that I had to drain. Also, mine wasn't burned, but the meat was getting very dark and starting to get a tad dry. I would cut the time to 50-55 minutes next time. And I'm sure I'll make this again.",
