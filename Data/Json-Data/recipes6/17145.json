                "reviewBody": "What a shame that because of one important flaw at least for me I feel I must rate this recipe two stars less than I d really like to. Some reviewers remarked that the cookie spread too much that it turned out flat and greasy. My experience was the same. One review suggests if butter rather than shortening were used this wouldn t be an issue. Actually the opposite is true. While butter contributes exceptional flavor it does have the tendency to make a cookie flatter. This is because butter has a lower melting point than shortening as well as water so it melts quickly and spreads the cookie as it bakes. In my case I used half butter half shortening and then refrigerated the dough for a good hour to firm that butter up but it didn t work this time. So I did a little investigating and quickly learned that too much fat wasn t the problem it was too little flour. If you like the sort of cookies sold at shopping malls like Mrs. Fields that are flatter greasier and sort of bendable then you d like these. If not and you want them drier chewier and thicker then add 1-1/2 c. of flour to this recipe! Yes that s significant! The taste of these cookies with the chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate) macadamia nuts and coconut coupled with the buttery flavor using half butter half shortening gives these cookies a flavor that is just out of this world. With 1-1/2 cups more flour or c. for the half recipe I made this would be the perfect cookie.",
