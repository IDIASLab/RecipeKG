I had them help make it; the neighbor boy across the street was so impressed he asked for the recipe and then made it with his dad the next day. He said the topping didn t puff up as much as mine I told him to add extra flour next time. I added extra flour to mine (1/4c); until the mixture was a little thicker than a standard pancake mix would look like. It would be very easy to play around with the hamburger mixture adding things like black beans but the only thing I did different was add shredded carrots in place of zucchini. Additionally did you know that you can substitute white vinegar in place of cream of tartar? It is made from tartaric acid and half neutralized with potassium hydroxide. This process transforms it into a salt. Grapes are the only significant natural source of tartaric acid and cream of tartar is obtained from sediment produced in the process of making wine. White vinegar or lemon juice in the ratio of 3 times the amount of cream of tartar called for will provide the right amount of acid for most recipes.",

Agree with other reviews the topping is awesome and worth the time and effort (my daughter 12 made the topping while I made the rest and it was oven ready quickly!) So worth it and a family pleaser!

I made some vegetarian-friendly changes: (1) morningstar farms crumbles cooked with 1/2c water and packet taco seasonings; (2)added sage garlic powder and greek seasoning along with the marjoram; (3) 3/4c GREEN salsa; (4)added peas and carrots to the corn; (5) as I was worried about the overwhelming amount of tomato-y based ingredients I opted for a few Tbsps tomato paste and a can of brothy non-tomoato soup (I used Amy's pasta and vegetable) instead of the condensed tomato soup. Finally the extra ingredients upped the cook time to approx. 40 minutes. The result was a recipe we make again and again!!",
