With that being said though I did prepare the cornbread mixture in my kitchen and not out in the woods. We had a lot of limbs down from heavy storms and lit a fire in our natural stone fire pit this weekend. I have a grate from an old BBQ grill that I used and it worked perfectly. I used butter instead of lard and cut back on the brown sugar due to personal preference. I'm not a cornbread fan but hubs said this was excellent. I didn't eat it but what I will say is that the texture was excellent. It was not dense whatsoever. He loved the vanilla in it and this is one I will make again and in the stove if need be.",
