I cut out the 2 tsp. of coffee granules as it would be way too strong and bitter. I also cut the icing sugar to 2 cups and I added two tbls. corn syrup as it gives an extra mellow sweetness to the frosting.Whenever I make frosting for cakes or squares etc. I always add corn syrup to give it an extra rich and creamy taste. Use a 9 inch pan fits just right.However if you want very thin and dainty type squares use a 9x13 inch pan. Just great! Also they would be better without the melted chocolate on them don't need it really. They have all the flavor and sweetness without it.",

It didn't tell you what size pan to use the mocha layer was bitter and 15 mins was not near long enough to chill in the fridge before adding the white chocolate. Some recipes I botch I keep just for myself to nibble on after deciding not to serve to guests. Not this one. Hope others have better success.",

Instead of spreading the white chocolate on top I melted it in the microwave in a ziplock baggie and snipped off the corner to drizzle it. Mine weren't chewy as another reviewer found but I also didn't store them in the fridge. These are so quick and easy... if you like coffee and chocolate you'll love them!",
