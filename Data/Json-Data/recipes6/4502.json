To avoid a mushy quinoa, you definitely need to cut the stock down to 2 cups, but it also helps if you prep the quinoa like this: rinse it and and drain it, and then put it in a pan and dry toast until a few grains begin to pop.",

From what I've read quinoa need a 1:2 ratio (quinoa to liquid) I tried doubling the quinoa. It made a HUGE batch way more than a family of 4 could eat. I imagine if you reduce the liquid to 1 1/2 cups it might be good. I will try it again.",
