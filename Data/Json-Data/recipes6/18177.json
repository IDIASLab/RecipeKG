I used unsweetened orange concentrate 1% milk and Breyer's double churned vanilla ice cream. It turned out perfectly. The only things that I changed was that I used about 12 ice cubes because I prefer a thicker drink and I found that I only needed a tablespoon of sugar the ice cream and orange concentrate were very sweet to begin with and I'd rather not have an over-sugary shake.

For the ice cream you can use either soy or coconut yogurt OR soy or coconut ice cream. This may not end up quite as tasty as when it is made with cow breast secretions (milk) but it is still good enough that my kids love it and they are very picky generally only liking things with lots of refined fats and/or sugars wheat & dairy (everything that makes people sick).",
