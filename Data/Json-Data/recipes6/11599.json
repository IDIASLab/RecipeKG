They're so light and have such a great texture it's hard to believe how easy they were. And this recipe let me worry about other things on Thanksgiving morning and just pop these in the oven at the last minute. I even had them at 350 instead of 400 degrees because I was reheating some other dishes and they still came out great. Thanks for the recipe I'll be making it every year!",

To make it out of this world... here's what you do: frost them with a simple thick powdered sugar/milk icing. Then if you like roll the dough into 5 or 6 circles and cut them into more than 8 slices. This makes the crescents smaller and thus increases the icing to roll ratio. That's they way my Grandma makes them...mmmmmm! It's always been a family favorite! Enjoy!",
