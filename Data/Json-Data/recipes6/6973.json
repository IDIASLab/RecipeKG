I sauteed a small onion with the garlic and used curry powder instead of the coriander and tumeric, because the first two ingredients of curry powder are coriander and tumeric!!!  I also halved the recipe and it was perfect for about 5 people. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes and some sliced olives.  Don't bother using one whole bunch of parsley and cilantro, I just used about 2 tbsp. of each and it was PLENTY!!!  If I would have used anymore, it would have been overpowering.  My hubby loved this recipe and he is so picky and hard to please, so when he says something is good, it must be really good!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Next time I make it I will try grilled chicken pieces instead of the ground turkey.",

Next time I would brown the beef with some of the spices as browned by itself the beef is bland.  (That was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.)  In Middle Eastern cooking spinach is often utilized as a herb with cilantro and parsley so for extra vitamins I'm going to add that next time.....and there will be a next time and soon!",
