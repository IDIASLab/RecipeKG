I used a waterbath canner and processed the jars for 10 minutes in it. The amazing thing about this jam is that it really really really does taste like strawberry! This is perfect for my stepdaughter who is allergic to strawberry but loves the taste of strawberries! I would let it set for about 3 minutes before pouring into jars just because my first poured jar had the banana and jelly part seperate a bit but all the rest were perfect so I'm thinking the pectin just needs a moment to set before you begin pouring. If you mash your bananas up well it mixes just fine and comes out a lovely rosy red color perfect for the holidays! This is a great first recipe for someone who has never attempted a jam before.",

General rule is one cup sugar to one cup fruit adjust based on if fruit is sweat or tart. Chop up the cranberries before you measure them this gives a better measurement and you don't have whole cerrberryy skins.. I had 3 cups of berries so used 4 cups of sugar figured the bananas did not need much sugar. Cook the cranberries with just the sugar ( it will liook dry but as soon it starts heating there will be plenty of juice). Add a pat of butter and turn the heat down to prevent foam. Cook until translucent an thichened them add the bananas for the last minute. No pectin required. If you boil your jars and lid you can put in the hot jam add the lid and it will seal. Being doing that for 50 years and the jam wiil keep for over a year.... If you don't eat it first.",

I thought this jam tasted more like strawberry than cranberry - maybe because it's so sweet? Also after the initial 10 simmer of the cranberries they were still mostly whole so I mashed them up with a spoon. Maybe that's the difference? Possibly if I had left them whole I would have gotten a more tart taste and would have been able to distinguish between the banana and the cranberry. But since I mashed the cranberries they just blended with the bananas and created a strawberry taste. Overall a good quick and easy recipe.",

I use pint jars since my opnion is that half pints can be used in one setting.. Thanks Barbara for this wonderful recipe",
