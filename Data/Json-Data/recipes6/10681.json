My husband thought they were great and suggested I add nuts next time. I love the texture and even though it is reminiscent of spice cake it has a nice texture and that good old-time muffin flavor. I will definitely use this again as mini-muffins for my grand-kids and also try it as a coffee cake in a 9\" baking pan. I gave it 5 stars for taste texture & versatility.",

For the batter: 1) mixed butter brown sugar eggs and applesauce 2) separately sifted together dry ingredients 3) pour wet mix into dry mix and stirred just until blended. Recipe made 24 mini muffins. Next time I will: use 1 cup all-purpose flour & cup whole wheat flour use either chunky applesauce or add chopped apple pieces.",

The second time I made them I used a packet of Kashi's instant apple and cinnamon oatmeal instead of the the spices called for. Plus it adds the healthy oatmeal that my son won't realize is in there.
