It was delicious!!  Because the chicken breasts are coated really good, they are so moist and tender!  I always cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise.  Makes them easier to eat, shorter to cook & always moist.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  Only difference, I cooked for about 20 minutes at 375.  And that was plenty of time.  Because the chicken was sliced thinner.  My husband loved it!  So did our son!  Thanks for the recipe!",

After the topping started to burn at 450 degrees after about 10 mins, I dropped the oven down to 350 for the remaining time.  375 for 30-35 mins is probably a better setting.  Also, I would change the topping by eliminating the bread crumbs at really crushing the Cheez-its.  You can always add a little dried herb to get the flavor from the italian bread crumbs.",

He named it \"Cheez-It Chicken\" :-) It was fast and easy, which made for a great weeknight meal. My only problem was that the topping got slightly burnt in places in the 450 degree oven uncovered. I suppose next time I should lower my temp a little bit.   It still tasted great, and I will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.",
