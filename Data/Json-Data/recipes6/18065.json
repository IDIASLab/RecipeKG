She uses 2 limes and about 4-5 tbsp of fish sauce. No sugar and use yellow onions. Don't mix the cucumbers in serve them on the side. We usually eat this with sticky jasmine rice and our hands. Also if you can manage roasted (raw) sticky rice that has been ground in a coffee grinder adds wonderful nutty flavor and texture (but beware it will make you cough and sputter when you make it). It helps to slice the beef as thinly as possible. But over all not bad but can be made better!",

The steak should be cut along the grain and it will soak up some of the juice.
