I started this stove top - melted the butter and sauteed the onions a clove of garlic a diced carrot and a 2 stalks of celery (not called for in the recipe) added the flour and made a roux. I stirred and cooked that down added chicken broth instead of water and the chicken soup base. Added the corn parsley dill and celery seed and chicken soup. Then added the potatoes - brought to a simmer and then added it all to the slow cooker set on low. I would suggest dicing the potatoes fairly small and I think I would omit the chicken soup next time and use use some milk when I made the roux. This is rather salty with the ham canned soup etc... be careful adding any extra salt. Overall we were very pleased with this soup I would really just suggest changing the method.",
