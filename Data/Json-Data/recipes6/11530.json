If you gently mix the cinnamon layer slightly with a knife (after pouring the 2nd layer of batter on), in makes a lovely cinnamon swirl instead of just a line going across the middle of the cake- just don't overmix it.  Preparing the cake pan with the cinnamon mixture made for a very nice, light sugary crust.  I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top just for looks. The inside was very tender, had excellent non-overpowering flavor and was delicious!  Got rave reviews from the husband. Thanks for the recipe Jo!",

It's reliable for something super easy to put together that yields a delicious moist result with a touch of sophistication. You can treat it like a \"dump cake\" the way the recipe is written and get good results, but having made it many times, I have made some easy modifications that take it to the next level without adding significant work:\n\nUse butter instead of oil to butter and \"flour\" the pan with the cocoa-cinnamon-sugar mix\nUse 1.5 sticks room temp butter instead of oil\nCream the room temp butter with the vanilla pudding mix, as if you were creaming together butter and sugar\nScrape the bowl and add each room temp egg one at a time until just incorporated\nScrape and add the dry cake mix and stir together\nAdd 3/4 cups of Harvey's Bristol Cream sherry (you can experiment with other sherries, but Harvey's gives consistent, excellent results) and stir to incorporate\nUsing a microplane or grater, grate a teaspoon of fresh nutmeg into the batter and stir in\nThe batter may be a little \"shaggier\" than if you use the oil+dump method, so you will have to sort of scoop it into the pan; scoop half of it in, add most of the remaining cocoa-cinnamon-sugar mix in a layer, then scoop in the rest of the batter and smooth the top a bit with a spatula and finish with a little sprinkle of the last bit of sugar mix on the top\nBake in the oven at just under 350\u00b0 F if possible, like 345\u00b0, for 40\u201345 m",
