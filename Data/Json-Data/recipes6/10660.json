I made a different filling for it however and I think you should feel free to make whatever filling you'd like. Because my filling was only enough for 4 I used the dough to make 4 calzones even though the recipe makes enough dough for 6 calzones. That was a mistake on my part because it made the calzones too doughy. But my husband was raving about it; between each bite he said \"This is delicious \" \"This is soooo good!\" That's worth any amount of effort!:)",

When they were done baking we dipped them in marinara sauce to add some extra flavor.
