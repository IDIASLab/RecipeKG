What makes this a good recipe is the process a lot faster than the traditional methods with the same result. Also the proportions are right for the other ingredients except the lemon I would use slightly less lemon however if it s a small lemon half is right but the egg to butter is the right amount. The cold water trick is also very useful for saving a broken sauce.",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks for the template: For those of you having trouble with this recipe start with unsalted butter in the pan. Then beat the yolks in a separate bowl and start adding lemon juice sparingly until you like how the yolks & lemon juice taste together. A tip: the uncooked combo of the eggs & lemon will be just slightly more acidic than the combo will taste when it's cooked. So add lemon juice until you like the raw taste then add just a tiny bit more juice because the eggs will then cook up and add a creamy flavor which will just slightly tone down the lemon (adding just a touch more juice than you think you need will keep your finished sauce from tasting too bland).THEN add only as much salt & pepper as you like. The amounts listed for this recipe are far too overwhelming. I didn't add any salt. It only took about three minutes for my sauce to thicken and become creamy but you must add the yolk mixture only drops at a time and you really have to whisk the sauce fast.I was very pleased with my sauce & will certainly be using this \"template\" again probably as my staple recipe for hollandaise. But make sure you make the changes to suit your own flavor.Thanks!",

For those of you new to cooking please disregard the insulting comments from Locklandworth and BoJacks. Sometimes it takes following a recipe or making mistakes to create the great cook you will eventually become. I honestly think the person that posted the recipe meant a pinch of salt and pepper not a teaspoon of salt and pepper. lol Just a little hint with this recipe: if using salted butter you may want to eliminate salt altogether. But taste your product to ensure it's tasty for you and your family before adjusting. Happy Cooking!!!",
