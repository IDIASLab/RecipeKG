Minnonite trick for all recipes using spices and eggs). I substituted 1/3 cup each of the following sugars: white, brown and corn syrup (Std cowboy trick for richer taste). At 35 minutes I placed a shield over the edges. I used a crust calling for cold unsalted butter and ice water and cut 1\" overhang with shears and folded under the edge and used my nuckle inside and two pinching fingers outside to form the edge. Squash/slide extra dough into center bottom to combat crust shrinkage. One guy at the Thanks Giving table ate three pieces and wanted more.",

The butternut squash was easy to work with and the whole recipe was simple. The only slight problem I had was getting the pie into the oven without spilling since it was quite liquidy before cooking (but it turned out the perfect consistency). We had it with whipped cream on top--yum! The second time I made this pie I didn't have any of the frozen/unbaked pie crusts. I used a graham ready-made pie shell and it turned out great! The liquid seeped into the crust giving it some flavor and preventing it from burning in the oven.",
