I wasn't sure what kind of delicious brownie mix to buy (they all look good) so I choose one with the extra chocolate packet;) I added a bit more peanut butter cream cheese and a tad more oil and they turned out to be fabulous-not greasy as I was worried. Also I added milk choc. chips and peanut butter chips (mixed bag)which added flavor and texture. My husband went crazy over them and I know the whole batch will be gone within 48 hours!",

These brownies don't slap you with peanut butter flavor but it is definitely there and they aren't bad. I didn't use the chopped nuts because I didn't have any but I thought the result wasn't affected by that. I was surprised that the brownies came out more cakelike than fudgy despite the \"fudgy\" recipe ingredient levels but then I thought abut it and the peeanut butter cream cheese filling adds an extra egg to the mixture so that would logically mean a more cakelike result. I might try it again but add only one egg to the brownie mix and 1/2 cup of water to see if the results were moister. My husband didn't like the way it came out as written.",
