I was able to made 12 medium size pancakes by upping the flour and buttermilk to 1/2 a cup, but left everything else the same.  I also added a splash of vanilla extract to the batter and used brown sugar.  These really didn't need syrup.  We rolled them up with sausage links and hubby (who's not a breakfast person) had 2 helpings.  I'm so glad I gave these a try.  Highly recommended!  Thanks bunches Amber :)",

I have tried other highly rated recipes on the site but they just don't compare to this one. Yummy! My child even compared them to the fabulous resturaunt (not a chain) pancakes I was looking to emulate and said she liked them as much! Well kids are perfectly honest! This is going to be a staple in my house. I did make a few changes to make them less fattening though: I used reduced fat buttermilk baking splenda for sugar and light butter instead of oil and they were still fabulous! I also had to subsitute 1/4 cup of milk for buttermilk since I ran out. I bet they'd be even better with the regular stuff. Great recipe.",

I tried them to make and freeze as a quick to-go snack though I was confused about the mixing method - THE BLENDER?? Doesn't this go against traditional pancake 'mix until just barely combined' reasoning? OKAY well it does. They seemed at first to be light and fluffy LOOKED GREAT but the texture was just too weird. Like gummy or something. I am still going to make them for myself alter the recipe and include whole grains and use them as a carb boost before running. But not ever for morning pancakes.",
