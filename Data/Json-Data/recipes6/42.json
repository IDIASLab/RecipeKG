I didn't make my own spaetzle but rather used some store bought, and mine ended up a little dry, but that very well might have been my fault as the ratios might have been off. So next time I would probably reserve some of the pasta cooking liquid. But totally delicious!

I used the Cost Plus World Market Spaetzle to save on time, and maybe used too much cause felt it needed more sauce, but something for me to play with.  This was delicious all the way through and my boyfriends family and I LOVED IT!! Will definitely making it again! Oh, didn't have a gala apple so use one that looked similar to it (sorry I can't remember the name of it) but it worked just as good!  And one more note, I hate sauerkraut, but in this dish... i could eat it all day!",

                "reviewBody": "Where oh where did I go wrong. I've made a dish very similar to this for years that everyone loves but this one no one liked. I found it to be a lot of work as written and the sauerkraut over powered everything good in this dish. Such a shame. I've made sp\u00e4tzle before but it's been years and I know I messed it up. My pot of water was not large enough to accommodate the noodles so I wound up with a mushy mess although they did taste good on their own they were lost in this dish. It would have been nice if the recipe specified how large a pot or how much water to cook the noodles in however being an experienced cook I should have known better. Anyway my second problem was with the sauerkraut. I always rinse and drain mine but because the recipe didn't say this I opted to put the kraut in as is. I know some people do not rinse because they like the full flavor of the kraut. I wrongly assumed this was the intention of the recipe. So color me stupid. At least that's how I felt. If I were to make this again I would do it my way. First saute everything in one pan bacon onion kielbasa then apple butter brown sugar. Rinse and drain the kraut and add that to the pan and simmer it all to blend the favors. When done throw in your noodles. I personally like kluski but I've even used egg noodles in a pinch or go ahead and make the spaetzle and stir it all together for a few minutes and serve. No reason to dirty a bunch of pans or casserole and no need to use the oven.",

Made my own home made Sauerkraut last year so looking to use some up and had some Polish sausage in the freezer too. Made this it is excellent! For the first try I skipped the butter apple and brown sugar because I was a little unsure about that. I didn't want to go for sweet right away. Now the next time I make this I will try it with the apple butter and brown sugar maybe because I think the flavors would blend famously! Excellent dish! Really happy I tried it! I will not here the Spaetzle was a new try for me I have not made Spaetzle before so I think it turned out but I will try other methods. Like I said I hadn't made Spaetzle before so not sure what to expect. Just the same it turned out great and the dinner was a hit with the family!!!:)",
