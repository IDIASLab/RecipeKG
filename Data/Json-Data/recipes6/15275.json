Make no mistake, this cake is CAKE, not a heavy, dense quick bread simply baked in a cake pan.  It has a beautiful, vivid pumpkin-orange hue, no doubt because it is subtlely spiced with a mere 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I liked that - it was nice to have a pumpkin cake where the flavor of the pumpkin was so bold and not hidden underneath tons of spices. While I would have loved to make this in a cake pan (if for no other reason than simplicity) and drizzled it with a glaze, cupcakes were more practical for my needs.  I baked them at 350 degrees, about 23 minutes.  I gave them just a little plop of vanilla buttercream to which I added cinnamon to taste. While a cream cheese frosting would have been good too, I liked this combination a lot! I have made a lot of pumpkin cakes over the years, many from this site.  I hope I remember this one - it's perfect.",

And everyone talked about how they made it differently in their review.  The original recipe should be removed! Can't taste the cinnamon, really no flavor at all.
