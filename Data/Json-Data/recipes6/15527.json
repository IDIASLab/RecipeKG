All that ball rolling got the dough too warm and they flattened in the oven too much to work as peach halves. When you roll the dough, put it into the freezer for twenty minutes.  Then they only flatten to hemispheres, which is just what you want.  The other change I made was the stems. Using plastic seemed fakey on such a fancy little cookie, so I used a gumdrop cut into a triangle and then stuck it into the end of the \"peach\" with a whole clove.  They were adorable and fun to make with the children, who delighted in rolling them in colored sugar.",

They are a treat to the eye and the palate and make a wonderful gift for giving. Many readers might like adding 1/2 tsp of salt to the cookies to better suit an American taste. In addition and to add more flavor to the filling use a full Tablespoon of rum or substitute 1 1/2 to 2 tsp rum flavoring for an even stronger flavor. For a richer moister filling I use only 1 1/2 cups of the reserved crumbs in the filling making another half batch if you don't have enough. Using a spray bottle to lightly wet the cookies before coloring with the sugars is helpful as is a friend or two to help in a production line. I like coloring my sugars in zip bags; your children will like squishing the colors in for you. You'll get a prettier look by dipping in the red first and then roll in or sprinkle with the peach color sugar. I also make the stems and leaves in the following manner: Roll green gumdrops 1/8 inch thick on well-sugared board. Cut into leaf shapes. Make small hole in stem end of leaf. Insert small piece of cinnamon stick through hole in gumdrop and into seam of \"peach.\"",

I am ALWAYS up for a cooking challenge and since I had never seen heard of or tasted these cookies before I turned to good ol' allrecipes who never fails me:) There are two recipes for these cookies on here. Both of the cookie doughs were similar so this was the exact dough recipe I used. My BIL also requestd that I make some with a strawberry jelly filling so I combined a 1/2 cup jelly with 2 or 3 tbsp of the cookie crumbs 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg which filled about 10 cookies. Of the three versions I made the filling in Ausrtian Peach Cookies II was our least favourite. The Austrian Peach Cookie filling recipe on here was our favourite and the strawberry jelly filling was second. I photo journalled my making of these cookies in hopes that I could help someone who was intrigued by the recipe but intimidated to try it. I highly recommend diving head first into a recipe that you have never attempted before. The best thing that can happen is an incredible epicural discovery that is received with high praise leaves you feeling proud of your accomplishment. The very worst thing that can happen is you now have an epic tale of cooking disaster to tell which will humour all who hear it for ages:)",
