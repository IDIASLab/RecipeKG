        "description": "This is a recipe I came up with while trying to figure out what to do with an over-abundance of rhubarb. I'm not fond of sugary, syrupy rhubarb sauces but I love rhubarb and I love salsa, so I figured why not put them together! Just grab a bag of tortilla chips, or better yet make your own, and enjoy! Feel free to adjust ingredients to your liking. Don't like jalapenos? Don't use them. Mix and match peppers however you like, just be sure to use 3 of them. Also, I prefer Nellie and Joe's&reg; lime juice because it's a bit more tart than regular bottled or fresh-squeezed lime juice, but if you can't find it that's fine, just use what you have.",

My rough chop of the bell peppers was too rough; I had to pulse the food processor too many times and the salsa was not as 'chunky' as in the picture.  Makes a lot of salsa; will half the recipe next time.  Easy to add more heat; just add more jalapeno or leave the seeds in.  It was a hit  at my wife's work; many requests for the recipe.",

I put the garlic salt and pepper into the lime juice mixture before pouring it over the salsa. This is a recipe that you can easily adjust to personal tastes regarding types of peppers and amount of heat. It is wonderful with chips but also great as an accompaniment to any grilled meat - pork burgers or chicken. Everyone I have served this to raves about it and asks for the recipe. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

The only changes I made was to add fresh garlic, squeezed lime juice and zest. I might add another jalapeno or two next time as we like heat, but can still taste the one (I always leave seeds).Can't wait for three more hours to see what it tastes like after flavors meld. Right after mixing this is amazing. Awesome recipe so glad it was shared.",
