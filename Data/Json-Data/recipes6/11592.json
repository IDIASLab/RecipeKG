This recipe is incredible the flavors and textures combine very well to create a very tasty and comforting dish. I made only minimal changes: used chicken thighs instead of breasts reduced the amount of sugar to about 1/3 cup (my Mirin was very sweet to begin with) and used about 4 big slices of ginger instead of grating it (left them in the pot the whole time.) Don't leave the Mirin out! Its flavor is an integral part of the recipe. And don't skimp on the watercress either watercress always shrinks when you cook it. This recipe will be a permanent addition to my collection.",

I had a bad feeling about them as soon as I took them out of the package - they were very unwieldy! The directions say to soak them before you put them in your recipe but I ignored it because it didn't say to do so in this recipe. Bad move! They were way too undercooked and the vegetables were overcooked. Next time I'll probably just do regular pasta or soba noodles. Overall everyone who ate it liked it and the noodles are the only thing I'd change. I also substituted celery for bamboo shoots and spinach for the watercress since I didn't have either on hand. They worked fine. Oh and I also added a couple cloves of garlic with the ginger. I will definitely try this again.",
