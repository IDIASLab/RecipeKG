Most of the time it comes out very professional and creamy. Tonight I made it without the butter and w/chocolate squares and it did come out grainy. Two weeks ago I made it using cocoa powder (no butter,again) and it came out perfectly. I didn't like the way chocolate squares melted and curdled,and for the first time my sauce came out grainy. I think using 1/2 butter is sufficient and 1 cup of butter is over-kill. I don't use butter at all.Weather also affects the way candies and sauces turn out, this week has been rainy..I'm in the Seattle area.",

The difference is that my mother cooked her sauce until it was thickened, but my grandmother kept hers on the heat about 20 minutes after it thickened, stirring every 5 minutes or so.  Cooking longer not only improves the texture, it takes some of the sweetness out.  I agree that two cups of sugar is plenty, but then I don't care for the sickening sweetness of store toppings made with corn syrup.  If you like your ice cream to taste sweeter than the sauce, use 2 cups.",
