He is a Boston-native and loves cranberries. This was the perfect combo of sweet and tart. The only reason why I would give this recipe less than 5 stars is because the pie is hard to invert out of the pan after it is done. Granted I did not fully seperate the pie from the sides before trying to flip. Next time I will grease the sides thoroughly and this should do the trick. I am giving five stars because no other reviewers had a hard time - must be the learning curve! Thanks so much for this recipe!",

It was incredible! The recipe as is is great but add the blueberries and it is really a cut above. I also used a cake pan and after cooling flipped it over like an upside down cake. Perfect! Be sure to heavily butter your pan before baking and to loosen the edges of the cake before flipping over. Looks great - tastes even better!",
