I also do not recommend that anyone eat pot roast rare as suggested by a reviewer. Pot roast is a very tough cut and the long braising and fall apart result is what a pot roast is all about. I would recommend that you salt and pepper the roast before browning because I thought it needed a bit more salt. I would also suggest that you use a grainy or country dijon and NOT a sweetened dijon mustard. The only changes that I made was that I used dark brown sugar because that is all I had. I cooked it covered tightly in a 275 degree oven for 4 hours and it turned out perfect. I did have to add more slurry to thicken the gravy because of all the juices that I had left. Next time I might stir a few crumbled ginger snaps into the gravy to give it an even more pronounced german flavor. This is a winner and I will make this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing.",

I made this with Sam Adams Oktoberfest, one of my favorite beers but I gave 3 stars allowing for different beers giving different flavors.  Mostly I think I didnt like the brown sugar which gives it a sweetened taste whereas I was looking for something more savory.  I cooked the roast in my slow cooker high for 3 hours cooks it perfectly.  remember it keeps cooking after you take it out so maybe take it out a bit sooner if you light it on the rare side.  Meat was tender, I just didnt like the lightly sweet flavor",

The gravy is a real flavorful german style gravy. Will definitely be saving this in my recipe box.",

I cooked this in the slow cooker for about 3.5 hrs and the roast was fork tender. Served with mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. Made a beautiful presentation. Personally I thought the gravy lacked flavor except for the sharp flavor of the ale I used (and as someone else pointed out each beer adds its own unique flavor) as well as the strong mustard flavor. I felt it needed another spice or herb to balance out the flavors perhaps rosemary or ginger? I wish I were better with herbs and how to combine them. Anyway I used my old standby Gravy Master to deep the color and flavor and it helped considerably. Perhaps some Better Than Boullion would have been a good addition. As another reviewer mentioned the onions layered on top of the roast did little for them. Those that cooked in the broth flavored the gravy and gave the onions an appealing appetizing color. Also 1 tablespoon cornstarch and water was not enough to thicken the gravy to my taste so I added more. To me this recipe is a 3 my Sweetie-Pi thinks it's a 5 hence the 4 star rating.",
