This dressing is NOT the orange colored 1000 Island we are all used to having. The combination of ingredients bring out excellent flavor as a dressing or veggie dip. I use it in my restaurant and customers who don't like 1000 Island love this dressing. Once you try it you'll know why it became so popular and wonder why every brand of 1000 Isle on the market is orange or pink!\r\n\r\nDan",

I used to love 1000 Islnd, but found that over the years the ready made stuff has bvecome too sweet or cloyingly sour.  And what is up with the color.  So when I ran out of all other dressings at home and saw I had all of the ingtreds to make this, I decided to see how it came out.  Well, I really love this!  Mine came out slightly pinkish - from the red peppers I guess, The taste is perfect, and even before I had the salad made I was dipping veggies into it.  Only additions were salt. a smidge onion powder (1 tsp.) and black pepper.  Thanks, Local 1000 Islander!\r\n",

I was even tempted to add paprika or a dab of tomato paste just to psych him. In the end, I decided against it and prepared it just as is.  To my surprise, delight and relief he remarked that the color of the dressing was an immediate tip-off that this was the real deal, the house made stuff you get in great supper clubs.  I agree.  This was beyond delicious, so different from commercially prepared Thousand Island dressings, and worth the few extra steps it took to make it.",
