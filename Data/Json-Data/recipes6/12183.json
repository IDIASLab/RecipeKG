Do not under any circumstances increase the ginger as it will make your cookies taste soapy. This cookie is great to give away and I get begged for the recipe every year.",

The only exception I was forced to make was the fructose - I couldn't find it anywhere in my area. I used confectioner's sugar. These basically tast like flour - with and without the sugar coating. I rolled some into balls as suggested in the recipe but chose to make the little \"pillows\" by rolling a rope and cutting that into small pieces. Sorry but we just didn't enjoy them.",
