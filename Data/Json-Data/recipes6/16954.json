My cousin's paternal grandmother was Ukrainian and used to make a similar recipe and as children we would devour it minutes (though we didn't know it was prunes until we were older) .  I could never find a recipe just like she made - until this one came along.  The hardest part is the waiting for it to stand - don't rush it as that process is what makes it so good.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.",
