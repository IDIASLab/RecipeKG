I tried adding about a 1/4 cup of oil some garlic and Italian seasoning to cut down on the sweetness but it didn't work. If I were to make this again I would cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and keep the rest the same. I used to top pasta salad so the sweetness wasn't too over powering but I won't according to the directions again.",

I thought what an easy fat free dressing but definitely not for us.",
