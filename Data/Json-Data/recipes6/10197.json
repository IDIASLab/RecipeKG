Their version is custardy versus the soft-fudgy/brown sugar ones that are a regional specialty.  The pie tastes better if made 1 night (or more) before serving. Good luck on having it around for that long! Serve topped with creme fraiche, if desired.",

It was so salty and so disappointing, as I had spent $38 on the ingredients for two pies to make a double batch EACH time. I found that if you omit the salt, add an extra 1/4C maple syrup, an extra 1/2C heavy cream, and an additional egg yolk it has a better custard-like consistency. Also, I find it helpful to pop the warm mixture of syrup and heavy cream in the freezer for 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid having to add it so slowly to the egg mixture so as not to cook the eggs. With these adjustments the pie is divine. Thanks for the recipe!",

I have to agree with other reviewers that there is too much salt in it. I'd say 1/4 tsp. is probably plenty. I made this for my husband and me but I'm dying to make it for guests to see what they say about it. Definitely a winner and not difficult to make.",
