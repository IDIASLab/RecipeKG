I made double the recipe without doubling the oil.  I used chicken bouillion instead of vegetable broth (that's just what I had on hand).  Also for some reason I imagined the directions had said to finely julienne the carrots, so I shredded them in a food processor instead of slicing them.  I didn't have lime juice either.  Otherwise I kept to the directions and it turned out great.  There were no leftovers.  My family loved it and at least one person had extra helpings.  :)",
