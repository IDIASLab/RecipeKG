Most ground turkey comes in 20-ounce plastic-covered trays, so I usually just peel off the top, dump all the ingredients in, make patties, and throw away the package. No dishes to do, except for the cooking pan and utensil.",

Admittedly, turkey burgers can be bland,  and they do need some seasoning, but I think this may be overkill.  The only flavor that was recognizable to me was the red pepper flakes.  But that\u2019s not to say that the finished product didn\u2019t taste pretty good because it did.  I\u2019m not much for broiling anything, so I did grill today for a weekday luncheon treat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
