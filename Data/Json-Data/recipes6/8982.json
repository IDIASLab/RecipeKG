The ginger isn't very predominate, so if you're wanting that to stand out more, I'd probably add 1-1 1/2 tsps of the ground ginger. My only issue with these was that the dough was a pain to mix together. Trying to incorporate the cream with the dry ingredients and berries wasn't particularly easy (and the berries got mushed a bit because of it); but I'd be willing to see if switching up the mixing process would make it easier. After finally getting the dough to form, I simply patted it out into an 8 or 9 inch circle, then cut into 8 scones from there. I think only cutting 6 scones would've made them too large. Regardless, these are so tasty: not to sweet, buttery, flaky, and very blackberry forward. I will be making these again--thank you!",
