I thought it would be a nice change from our traditional Easter carrot cake...and...it was!  I took some of the tips and added a half cup of shredded coconut to the batter.  I also added a middle layer of coconut, pineapple and sliced bananas on top of the icing.  I decorated the top with more shredded coconut and more chopped walnuts.  It was the hit of Easter and the day after...we had to remove it from the table so my cousin would stop eating it!  My only suggestion is to bake the cake at 325, not 350...that's too high.  The bottom and sides came out a bit darker than I'd like.  But it was still delish! Red Velvet move over...Hummingbird is becoming my new signature cake!",

I did make changes, so if you're a purist, read no further..I used 4 very soft, overripe bananas, and a large can of crushed pineapple that I thoroughly DRAINED and used paper towels to get out the remaining juice. I also used a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to give it some interest.  I did not cover it in the cream cheese frosting, but instead made a drizzle of 4 T butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and about a cup of confectionary sugar. I sprinkled chopped pecans over the top of the drizzled cake. It was excellent. In fact, if you and your family can wait, I suggest letting it sit for a couple of days (mine is in a domed cake plate) as it gets even better with age (a lot like banana bread). I will definately be using this slightly modified recipe again and again, as only half of my family will eat bananas, but not a one had trouble gobbling up this cake!!! try it out!",
