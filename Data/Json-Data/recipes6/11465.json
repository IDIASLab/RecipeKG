The only thing I would change is instead of adding water, I would add cold coffee and instead of 1 tsp of cayenne pepper I would decrease it to just 1/2 tsp.

I even let it cook about 35-40 minutes checking it every 5 minutes over 30. Also I added a cup of coffee instead of the water and used a different icing recipe. I used the half tsp of cayenne and it is not noticeable at all except in the most complimentary way. In some gourmet stores you can buy a chili cocoa powder from South America. I plan on using this next time in place of the cocoa and omitting the cayenne. This will definitely become one of my staple cakes.",

It's almost as if you don't know where it came from. I like that and will take it with me to the next chocolate cake recipe.
