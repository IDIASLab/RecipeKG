The other up is the flavor it's rich and creamy just like ice cream. But the down side was that when cooking I had trouble with the pie browning too quickly and not settling like I expected. So be careful and watch it (them) like a hawk. But the creamy flavor outweighs all! it's delicious. I added vanilla extract to my pie for a bit of vanilla flavor. A great addition if I must say so myself. I also added my cinnamon into the pie instead of on top of it. So overall this recipe will yield you two rich and creamy pies.",

My dad was dying and kept saying, \"I sure wish I had a good cream pie like my mom used to make!\" I thought he meant coconut or banana but nope, just a plain cream pie. I brought out my ipad and started searching the web for recipes. Reading them off to him. He would say, \"no, that doesn't seem right.\" And then I found this... He said yeah that seems familiar. So I ran out to walmart at 2 am one night , gathered all of the ingredients, came back home, made him his pie. He loved it. I found this recipe in April and he died May 12th. I made 7 pies and he wouldn't let a single soul eat another slice. I'm so thankful to you for sharing this recipe. I haven't made one since, but I'm thinking of whipping up one of these in his memory one day this week.",

                "reviewBody": "I love how easy it is to make this. Put it all in a blender and pour into a crust! I love cream pies but find the stove-top recipes to be very tedious. I used evaporated milk instead of half and half because I didn't have any. I also mixed the cinnamon into the batter instead of sprinkling on top and added a couple shakes of nutmeg. The cinnamon flavor was nice but I think I would like to try a vanilla pie next time. Like others have said the pie browned VERY quickly on top- I even reduced the oven temperature to 325 hoping it wouldn't brown so fast but it did anyway. I had to bake it a little longer (75-80 min) because I lowered the oven temp. I may try covering it during baking with a large inverted metal bowl- I've done this with cheesecakes and it works nice to keep them from browning. Also the batter was VERY thin next time I make this I will try doubling the flour. I also made a chocolate version- I omitted the cinnamon and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder (didn't have chocolate on hand). I preferred the chocolate pie to the original but I think I will try adding melted chocolate next time instead of cocoa powder just to see if I like it better. The chocolate batter was much thicker than the original pie and baked nicer. Overall it's a great recipe- my family loved the pie and I'll definitely be making it again.",
