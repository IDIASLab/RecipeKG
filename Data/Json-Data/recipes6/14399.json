I didn't even like making these, and  looked forward even less to eating them. Imagine my taste buds' surprise to find they liked these!  Good flavor arises from the caramelization of the onions and brussels sprouts, the little bit of sugar is just enough to eliminate the bitterness brussels sprouts can have, and the roasted, salted pistachios I used were the perfect complement, both in taste and appearance. This just proves what moms like to say, that you should try something before you say you don't like it!",
