She really wanted to bake something but I had a limited amount of items on hand and since they didn't have eggs or milk it worked out great. Also I found a way to use up the jar of salad dressing I never use. Not the best cookie but I will definately make them again because they are \"kid friendly\". We are always baking up a batch or loaf of something and these are great for a quick cookie fix. Thanks for sharing!",
