I then added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and doubled up on the sugar as well. I chopped up the apples instead of slices to have a more \"fritter\" feel to them. I also ended up adding a little more milk to the batter because they were coming out raw inside. Once I did this they cooked all the way through very nicely.",

I put the diced apples in the microwave for 4 minutes to soften them up a bit, then added the cooked down apples & liquid to the batter. It was a perfect consistancy. Dropped them into the oil using 1/4 measuring cup. this made a good sized fritter. Thanks for a great recipe!",

THANK YOU PAT! my kids adore these too. if you have trouble with the batter sticking, pat the apple slices dry with a paper towel first. i like a little cinnamon in the batter too, and if you dust these with powdered sugar then drizzle with caramel topping, you will have an absolutely heavenly treat! wish i could give it six stars!",
