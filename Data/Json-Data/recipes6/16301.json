It's my go-to recipe for when I need something sweet yet substantial in my menu, or want to give a from-the-kitchen thank you gift that's a little more sophisticated than cookies (these pecans look really pretty in a nice cellophane or sheer fabric bag tied with ribbon or raffia).  I tripled the recipe and served them in foil cupcake liners at my daughter's birthday party and both the adults and kids gobbled them up.  The spices are great as written, but I like to add a few dashes of chili powder or cayenne to lend a little spice.  I line my baking pans with nonstick foil, bake them at 325, stir every 7 minutes or so, and watch carefully as sugared nuts can go from happily baking to unhappily burning in a nanosecond.  I can't remember if the recipe directs it or not, but I recommend pulling the foil (with the nuts on) off the pan and letting the nuts cool on the foil on the countertop for 5-10 minutes before gently stirring to loosen and removing from the foil.  All in all, this has been a terrific standby recipe that was the first one I thought of to put in my AR recipe box.",

I also dropped my oven temp to 300 and stirred every 5 minutes or so.  Were in oven a little over 20 minutes total.  AND I used a Pampered Chef stone so I didn't have to deal with foil or parchment paper.  Made stirring easy.  Overall though, very good.",

They are as follows:  Used 1 tablespoon of vanilla in lieu of the water.  Used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Reduced ground cloves to 1/8 teaspoon and used 1/4 teaspoon plus a tad more of cayenne pepper.  I used recommended amounts for the egg white, pecans, salt, cinnamon & nutmeg.  I baked on 300 for 30 minutes checking about every 5 minutes and stirred about 4 times throughout process.  I also used parchment paper instead of foil.  Total winner!!!  Husband loves them too ~~",
