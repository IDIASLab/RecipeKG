I have a big Paddy's day party with over 40 people and make about 60 lbs of corned beef every year. If you want to make this for a lot of people you can do all the boiling the day before, wrap each brisket in foil and refrigerate until the next day.  Its a lot easier to trim the fat off when the meat is chilled. I use the sugar, cloves, mustard and ginger with some honey and then bake the briskets for about 30 minutes to reheat and add that honey clove flavor to the outside. There is never any leftovers. Make sure to cut against the grain. That is the most important step if you don't want your brisket to be tough and chewy.",
