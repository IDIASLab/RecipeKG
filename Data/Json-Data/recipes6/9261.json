I made a \"greek seasoning\" mix of 2 parts each oregano and onion powder; 1 part each garlic powder black pepper and cornstarch; and 1/2 part each cinnamon and nutmeg (you can also add salt and beef bouillion granules). I used 2 tsps of that and around 1 tsp of salt decreased water to 1 cup and increased tomato juice to 2 cups. I also used 1-1/2 cups of locally-grown shoepeg corn instead of canned which gave it a nice sweet crispness. I might try using something like Morningstar veggie crumbles next time to make this a vegetarian recipe.",

Because I was halving the recipe, I made the following adjustments: I used one can of dark kidney beans, a whole can of tomato with chilis (I didn't want four half-cans kicking around the fridge), and used regular green cabbage. I also added a dash of chili powder for some heat. Finally, I was glad that I had bought a large bottle of tomato juice because I found that I needed to add more during the one hour simmering process. It would have been way too dry otherwise. This is a really easy to prepare but tasty and comforting meal. Thanks, Kimberley!",

The recipe has a slight spicy bite, but not overwhelming--just right.  My wife thought it was excellent too.  The Greek spice is a fine, fine touch.  I will experiment with this spice in other dishes down the road.  Do note that the Greek spice version I found does have MSG in it though.  I'm eating healthy these days, so I used ground turkey.  This is a very good recipe--and completely fool proof (if I can make it, you can too).  Thanks.",
