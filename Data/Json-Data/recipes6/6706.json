Once the shallot and garlic was softened, I removed it from the pan so that I could crank up the heat to get a good sear on the salmon. Once I flipped the salmon over to skin-side down, I lowered the heat back down to medium, topped it with the shallot-onion and continued as written.  I used a center-cut piece of salmon which was about 1\" thick. It came out a nice juicy medium-well, just how I like it. Next time I would probably add more seasoning to the fish.",
