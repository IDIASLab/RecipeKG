The first time I made them I was short 1/2cup oats so I used 1 cup old fashioned oats and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal. Very good. The next time I made them I followed the recipe as written and they were  very good. I am using this as my base muffin recipe from here on out. I have substituted 1cup grated zucchini for the diced apple with rave reviews. This is a tasty no fail recipe in this household. I make them at least once a week. I\u2019m making them with pumpkin pur\u00e9e and pumpkin pie spice with dried cranberries as I type.",
