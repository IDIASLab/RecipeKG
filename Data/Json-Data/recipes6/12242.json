                "reviewBody": "Here's a tip for getting the crushed peppermint/sugar to stick to the cookies. Pour a little Karo light corn syrup into a microwave safe bowl and put it in the microwave just long enough for it to become very runny almost like water (maybe 20 seconds). Brush this onto the cookies (the silicone pastry brushes are great) and immediately sprinkle the topping on. I put the cookies on a wire rack with a sheet of waxed paper underneath. Let them dry completely before storing. You can do the sprinkling after the cookies cool so that they're a little sturdier. BE CAREFUL with the hot Karo it gets extremely hot very fast and could cause a very nasty burn. I adore these cookies and think they are well worth the trouble! I've made them for many years my old recipe used half Crisco/half butter but is otherwise identical.",

Ours were slightly larger (not on purpose) and instead of making 1 strip in the shape of a candy cane our candy canes were composed of 2 different color strips twisted together. To do this we simply left half of the dough in the bowl and used red food dye to color it red while leaving the other half of the dough white. We also ended up adding about a tablespoon or so more milk to the dough. Don't eat these cookies warm from the oven on the first day because we tried them and they weren't all that great.
