The recipe only made for one 6 cup bundt and 1 smaller quartet bundt. Had I known that I would have added more of the coconut filling in the 6 cup bundt; so if you are intending to make smaller bundts you may want to keep that in mind. Also I chose not to add the raisins but did double the pecans personal preference but I may try it with raisins the next time. I dusted the cakes with a little confectioner s sugar only to dress them up a bit. The taste and texture was very good.",
