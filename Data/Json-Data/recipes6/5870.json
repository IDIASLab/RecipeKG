The beauty of this recipe is the dipping sauce is versatile as well as the filling. I made a burrito bowl using all the ingredients adding some tomatoes cheese and lettuce with the dipping sauce and it was delicious. The dip would be great as a substitute for ranch dressing for a veggie dip. My suggestion is to play around with the dipping sauce adding the lime conservatively until you reach the level that you like.",
