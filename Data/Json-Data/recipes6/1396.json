In the ingredients for the brownies,  the list says 1 egg- but in the directions (and on the box) it said two, so I used two. In the list for the PB ingredients,  it says 1/4 cup butter, but in the directions, it says 2 Tbsp so that is what I did. Just follow the directions more so than the ing. list. I had to cook them about 7 min longer than recipe states, but I find that common with brownies to get them done all through. Very delicious!",
