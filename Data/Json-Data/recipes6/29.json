One cup is not enough for four servings let alone a whole spaghetti squash. In addition 2 whole teaspoons of salt is far too much salt especially when most tomato sauces that you can buy at the store (I used Contadina) already have salt added to them. One or two pinches are really all that is needed. And finally this recipe does not need sugar! Besides the sugar already present in the tomatoes spaghetti squash is already sweet - it is a squash after all. What I changed: I used 1 cup of sliced mushrooms 1 15 ounce can of tomato sauce no sugar no bell pepper (personal taste - I don't like bell pepper) and 2 medium stalks of diced celery. I guess I made my own recipe but this recipe was the inspiration.",
