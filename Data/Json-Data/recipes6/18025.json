I found that the cake was so moist and dense that the center never seemed to get done and it almost over flowed. I ended up covering it with foil. Over all baking time for me was 1 hr 15 minutes. It was really really good and I'm definitely keeping this recipe. It would probably even work for dessert!! Cathryn",

I live in Guatemala and those things exist but not commonly and usually are off brands or of lower quality. I prefer using natural ingredients as much as possible. Like many others I made a few changes to the basic recipe. I used butter rather than oil in the peach mixture as well as added a half teaspoon of salt to kill some of the sweetness of canned peaches. I added about a Tbsp of cinnamon to the mixture because hey I love cinnamon. I also added the juice of the zested limes -- can't get lemons here -- to the batter for a bit of extra flavor. The resultant cake is fabulous light rich and delicious. Allrecipes is making me famous here among the community because I'm always finding new and interesting recipes to delight my friends and neighbors. Thanks a lot.",
