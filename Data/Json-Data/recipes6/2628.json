My apple and pear were ripe and very juicy and as I suspected that juice thinned out the yogurt dressing making the salad a bit watery. Would recommend making just what you plan to eat because I don t think this would hold up in the fridge overnight. After one hour it was already very wet. In spite of the dressing comment it tasted fresh and wonderful! I used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand) and included all of the optional ingredients as well. Probably won t use the nutmeg the next time but the cinnamon was spot on. ALLIDAWN thanks for sharing!",

I used plain Greek yogurt added brown sugar and honey in to sweeten the yogurt. I peeled the apples and pears chopped them about 1 inch thick (bite size) squeezed 1 lemon over the fruit mixed and refrigerate. I roasted pecans and sunflower seeds in the oven til golden brown this gives it a better nutty flavor. I added the cinnamon in the yogurt then dried mixed fruits (raisins cranberries blueberries) also in the yogurt. About an hour before dinner I mixed the fruits in the yogurt then topped with the pecans and sunflower seeds. When the guest sat down to eat I mixed the nuts (last to keep it crunchy) in with the yogurt.",
