I didn t have a green pepper canned tomatoes or chili mix and didn t feel like going back out to get them. I nixed the onion due to allergies. As with another reviewer I added more chili pepper and just added the tomato sauce we use for pasta. My hubby tasted and he the fussy chef loved it! Only next time I ll have to try to remember what I did!",
