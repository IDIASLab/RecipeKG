One slight clarification the recipe could use is that you're blending the BROWN sugar with the flour for the crust and the WHITE sugar with the fruit. I found them to be quite hard to cut into nice regular pieces. I baked for the recommended times but next time I'll allow them to cook longer to hopefully make them less sticky less prone to crumbling along the cut edges and easier to cut. I also may try dusting them lightly with powdered sugar as I'm serving to give them a more finished look.",
