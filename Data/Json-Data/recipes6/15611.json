I only baked for about 45 minutes because the crust was more than done and the apples were getting overly brown. I let the pie cool and then drizzled with the icing. Upon cutting the filling was runny and with the addition of the icing it was very very sweet. We ate it on ice cream and the kids loved it but it was too sweet for my husband (an apple pie lover)and I. I will stick to a more traditional recipe next time.",
