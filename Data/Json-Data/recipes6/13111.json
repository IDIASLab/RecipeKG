I also whipped the egg whites  before folding them in to make them extra fluffy.  Tip: if the dough starts sticking to your hands when you're rolling them, spray your hands with some non-stick cooking spray.  Also, I ended up lowering the temperature to 375 and cooking for a full 8 minutes (the bottoms dont end up as burnt).",
