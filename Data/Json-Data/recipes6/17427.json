Second refer to the Perfect Flan article on how to make this dessert just right. Don't forget if you precook the milk and temper the eggs with it the oven bake time will be cut down so keep an eye on it. Third if you use ramekins this recipe will probably not fill 8 of them. My ramekins are fairly small and my flans came out very thin. I garnished my flans with toasted slivered almonds French Lace Cookies II and piped sweetened whipped cream.",
