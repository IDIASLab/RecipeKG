I also didn't have cucumbers but I did have a green bell pepper so I used that and sliced it nice and thin. For a bit more crunch I added chopped walnuts and halved grapes. They worked very well with the dressing and the vegetables. Overall this was a really nice simple salad that would work in almost any meal.",

I'd cut some of the sugar next time. We don't eat raw onions so I left them out although I did add some dried minced onion to the dressing for the onion flavor. I also didn't have carrots but I'll try it with carrots next time. It isn't to vinegar-y (at least I don't think so!). I did halve the salad just so we could try it. We had a tiny bit leftover but it was almost the perfect amount for the two of us. Thanks for the recipe!",
