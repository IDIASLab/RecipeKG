I reduced the recipe to 8 servings, used white balsamic vinegar (didn't have sherry vinegar), used powdered coffee (Starbucks Via) instead of brewed coffee and added water for substitute), also didn't read recipe directions at end and added ketchup with rest of ingredients and let it cook.  Used an immersion blender while it was still warm and couldn't wait to taste it.  WOW is all I have to say.  Hubby & I are both thinking  about all the different ways we can use this.  It has a nice amount of sweetness, spice and bite (from cayenne) to go on just about anything.  Next time I'm making the full recipe!!!  Thank you so much, Cheryl!  It's awesome!",

Unusual combination of ingredients and the punch of flavor from the cayenne is spot on. Once refrigerated it's a little difficult to spread but a short reheat in the microwave brings it back to spreading consistency. This recipe may not be for everybody but we enjoyed it. It's definitely \"outside the box.\"",

Maybe it was because of my preconceived notion that the bacon would really shine through and the spread would be nice and smoky. It ended up tasting more like bacon sloppy joe mix or barbecue sause and being REALLY sweet and I didn't even add all of the ketchup. I don't think it's a bad recipe I just think it's too sweet for my palate. Mine was also considerably greasy. I drained all of the bacon emptied all of the grease aside from probably a tablespoon or two definitely nowhere near a half cup. The grease rose to the top and looks a mess my hope is I can scoop a good amount of it off once its completely cooled in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe it was fun to try.",
