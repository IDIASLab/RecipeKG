As A cake I would rate this dessert a 4. I reduced the amount of cinnamon to 1/4 and the amount of vinegar called for to 1 tbsp and added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I also used berry juice (Juicy Juice) instead of apple juice to strenghten the berry flavor of the batter which I found worked very well. When I folded the berries in I allowed them to break up somewhat to add even more flavor to the batter I also dusted the top with confectioners sugar which presented lovely. This cake was fluffy and had wonderful rich berry flavor esp with the berry juice addition. I assume the reduction of the vinegar allowed for better rising and made it less dense then the others experienced. I suggest to anyone wanting a good breakfast cake to try this with these changes it was very good.",

I read the other reviews first and added another egg as well as a splash of vanilla. Instead of apple juice I used lemon juice diluted with water and instead of just tossing in the blackberries I pureed half a cup of them and stirred that into the mix and then placed a blackberry on the top of each muffin in the pan before baking. They are DELICIOUS. So soft fluffy and my boyfriend says they are not as overwhelmingly sweet as other muffins (he says they are almost tart). This is such a great recipe. I am going to keep it around and modify it accordingly - next time I'll increase the spices and do an apple spice muffin and maybe also a blackberry-lemon muffin. Yum!!",

Also after reading how dense it seemed to be for alot of people I creamed my sugar & butter then added eggs & beat for around 3 mins so the egg whites would get nice & fluffy then \"folded\" in all the rest. The results were outstanding!!! Made into cupcakes & frosted with cream cheese frosting. On my 2nd batch I added toasted walnuts made it all the much better. Since I have such a hard time finding a moist zuchinni bread recipe I'm thinking of trying that in the next few days. Turned out very moist!! Kids loved em'!!!!!",
