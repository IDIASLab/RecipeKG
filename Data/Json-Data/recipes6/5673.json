I think the yams and corn give it a little something extra, plus it's a great way to get more veggies in.  All in all a very hearty meal. I like to serve with quartered tortillas for dipping!",

Took 1 1/2 lbs chicken and 1 lbs pork and sauted them with the onions and garlic in a saute pan.  Seasoned this mixture with fresh ground black and cayanne pepper.  Once the pork and chicken were lightly browned I deglaced the pan with white wine and reduced by 1/2.  Added this mixture to the slow cooker with the remainder of the ingredients plus 1 14oz can of chicken stock and another sprinkle of cayanne on top.  Turned out great and added an extra layer to the flavors of this chili.",
