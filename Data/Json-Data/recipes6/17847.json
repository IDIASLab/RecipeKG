Hubby especially loved this but we both thought the coffee flavor was a little strong. Would prefer this with less or even without it altogether. This is a light dessert which might explain why we both went back for seconds. Or maybe it's just really good! I left the nuts out for hubs' sake and actually I think I liked it better that way anyway. It would seem a shame to destroy that light as a feather melt in your mouth texture with little crunchy interruptions. The biggest criticism I have for this is that it's difficult to get out of the pan neatly in spite of greasing the pan. I don't know what the solution to that would be if there even is one but it sure made a difference in terms of how it looks on the plate when served. But the fact that this \"angel\" pie really does taste like manna from heaven kind of makes you let its imperfect presentation slide.",
