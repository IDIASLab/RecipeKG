I used a teaspoon of cinnamon oil as well but if you can buy blaack berry jam just cook it with some water to losen it up and then sstrain the juice that will work too. For halloween I am cutting apples into fourths and then dipping the slices that have been cored in the candy and giving them to kids I'll post picturess then... all in all I love this recipe.",
