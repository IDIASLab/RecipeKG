I really like cranberry and orange together, so instead of using 2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of un-diluted frozen orange juice concentrate, and 1 cup of milk. I also added 2 tsps cinnamon, and 1 tsp nutmeg. The butter sauce was a little sweet for my tase, so next time I would deffinetly cut down on the sugar. We loved it though! Thanks for this recipe :)",

                "reviewBody": "The mixed reviews are interesting for this cake. It seems that people either love it or hate it. I thought it was excellent although I made two very minor changes. First I used 8 tablespoons of butter rather than six--there is just very little fat in this recipe and I thought it would help. Since I haven't tried it with only six I can't really compare the original with what I made but the 8 tablespoons worked very well and I suspect that the cake is a bit moister as a result. I also did not want to open two cans of evaporated milk to get two cups. Instead I used a 12 oz. can and added 4 oz of regular milk. Again this worked well. I have a feeling that the people who don't like the cake are folks who were expecting a super sweet dessert. This cake is not super sweet and that is what I prefer in a dessert. If you're looking for ultrasweet cake you will probably be disappointed. However this is why the sauce works so well--the sauce which is excellent is very very sweet. I think the sauce pairs well with the tartness of the fresh cranberries. I'm also likely to use the sauce with other cakes--I have an apple bundt cake that would be perfect with the sauce. Overall a very good recipe that I will add to my holiday arsenal.",
