Here's what I did: substituted 1 cup of the flour with 1 cup of rolled oats; substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with Splenda; used 1-1/2 cups plain low fat yogurt as a substitute for applesauce and vanilla yogurt; added 1 tsp vanilla; used 3 whole eggs and threw in a 1/2 cup of water because the batter was so thick. Baked the muffins in the giant muffin tins -- result was 12 perfectly baked muffins in 20 minutes. They were wonderful out of the oven but the next day were better -- the flavor settled in and the muffins became dense. Now it's day 3 and they're even better especially with apricot jam.

I actually used some of theobromine goddess' suggestions from above in the hopes of avoiding the \"rubbery\" texture everyone seems to be getting. Rather than using 3 egg whites and 1 whole egg I used 4 whole eggs. I also eliminated the water from the recipe entirely. Also instead of raisins I used dried cherries cut in half. The muffins came out GREAT. I love that they don't need butter or oil. They're SO MOIST and have that wonderful pumpkin spice flavor. I antisipate making them again and again... they'll be great for the holiday baking season!",

First I completely forgot to look at the can of pumpkin I had and it already had spices in it (Libbys) so I ended up doubling the spices accidently. I also used regular Splenda (not the mix of sugar/Splenda) in the recipe and had half the eggs be whole eggs the other half egg whites. Everyone loved the muffins they came out great very moist and I couldn't tell I had substituted Splenda for sugar. Since the recipe called for applesauce (I used non-sweetened) and nonfat yogurt I felt like it was such a healthy recipe!",
