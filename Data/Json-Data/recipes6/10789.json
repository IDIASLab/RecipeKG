But there were a few things I would have appreciated knowing. When making the filling make sure that the flour mixture cools completely. I did not and my filling was very thin. I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes and it thickened up a bit. Also after layering the cake with the filling if your cake seems to look like the layers will slip apart put wooden skewers in the cake and cut off the top of them (you'll frost over them and then find them as you cut the cake - they're easy to find as long as you're not cutting huge pieces). With the icing make sure that you beat it well (after cooking it) so it gets thick. I put the icing in a bowl after it boiled for a minute and beat it with my electric hand mixer for about 5 -10 minutes. It's a great icing. I had to spread it on the sides a bit but you have to be quick because it gets hard.",

Next time I make it I am going to use 8 inch pans instead of 9 inch pans. Since the recipe calls for you to cut the cakes in half they were kind of thin to be cut in half. Also the filling was very generous for those thin layers. I think it would be better if the cakes were thicker and this would also make the whole cake taller which would'nt hurt. Also I used real butter in the cake. But when it came time to make the icing I was out of real butter so I had to use margarine and I did'nt read the recipe good enough when it says to let the icing boil a minute without stirring. I was stirring away. Anyway because I stirred too much or because I used margarine versus butter the icing did'nt get thick enough. Learn from my mistake. It did get thick just not thick like a hostess cupcake. When I poured and drizzled it should have been thick enough to stop at the bottom of the cake plate but some of it ran off. Kind of made a mess but it sure tasted great!! This one is a keeper!!! Aunt Pitter Pat from PB",

Yes it does taste similar to those little hostess cakes but this cake tastes better. The chocolate glaze on the outside makes it look like the whole cake has been dipped in chocolate. Its great for writing on with the cream frosting(because there will be alot left over) but candles with cause the outer chocolate layer to crack and look less impressive.
