It seemed appropriate that it's also the first review for this recipe. I did make a few changes, based on what I had.  (1) used sour cream (no Greek Yogurt) (2) added 1 tbsp sugar to cocoa/water mix (4) used 1 tsp vanilla, since that seems typical in baking recipes, thought the 1 tbsp. might have been typo.  The flavors are more subtle/mild than most recipes. The banana and chocolate are not overpowering, which I prefer because this bread goes great with hot cocoa, hot tea, coffee or a glass of milk, without having strong competing flavors. As the poster mentions, it is not real sweet. So if you want a bold, sweet flavor, this may not be what you're looking for. But if you want a simple, wonderful complement to a relaxing cup of tea, this is perfect! I also really liked the texture; some recipes are too moist-they can be too dense, almost doughy; others can be dry; this is moist without being overly heavy.  Thank you Chef V for sharing!",
