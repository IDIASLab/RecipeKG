I do quite a bit of baking and have successfully made many different desserts.  For this one I followed the recipe exactly, however no one mistook it for apple.  It did LOOK like apple cobbler, but after the first bite it was obvious that it wasn't.  It just seemed not-quite-right and had a definite non-apple aftertaste.  The more crust in the bite, the better - I took a bite and got mostly zucchini and it was not good.  After that, I couldn't finish it - and I ALWAYS finish dessert.  My husband says that this proves the zucchini doesn't belong in dessert.  We threw the rest out, and I won't be making this again.  Oh well, it was worth a shot.  Is it apple season yet???",

I did halve the topping ingredients as suggested by others and it worked out great. My version worked out to two and a half points on the weight watcher plan and that was for one large portion.
