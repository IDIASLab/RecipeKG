I used 6 tbs of coco powder in the dry mix instead of baking squares because I didn't have any so I just added 2 extra tablespoons of butter to the milk and water mix and it turned out wonderful. Also I've never made sour milk before so I took another reviewers advice and put 1 1/2 tsps. of vinegar in the milk but it still was not sour in 5 minutes. I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds and it was seperated and was peeerfect sour milk. Thank you for this recipe. Everyone loved it!",
