As recommended, I made double the sauce and didn't leave it over for dipping--- I just slathered the whole amount on there throughout basting! The first time, I didn't listen to others advice and only made the standard amount of sauce. Big mistake! Make double!The sauce was finger-licking good (I mean literally) and I was so pleased that I made my own sauce. No more store-bought-- this one's a keeper! As other people mentioned, I also added a bit of chili pepper flakes for some heat, and it was the perfect balance. Thanks for the recipe for these tender, delicious ribs!",

Instead of 1 tbsp of white sugar in the rub, I subbed 3/4 tbsp of white sugar and 3/4 tbsp of brown sugar.  Added 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the sauce, used dried minced onions vs fresh diced onion and added 1/4 tsp of dried red pepper flakes to balance the sweet sauce.  Perfect mixture of sweet and spicy.  Took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and am so very glad I did!  Thanks Gail for a GREAT recipe!",

They rave on how tender they are too. Its a good fake out recipe for beginner grillers. I do have a few suggestions though.  First, Beware the spice rub. I slathered it on the first time and it was WAY too much.  I'm a little more careful with it now and i put some on the meaty side, and very little on the bone side.  Second, Double the sauce recipe and put extra on the ribs and completely forgo the dipping sauce.  These are tender enough you can eat them right off the bone without a hassle.  The sauce isn't that yummy by itself, but the spice rub totally brings the flavor out.",

Also, I might have used the wrong type of chili sauce, but the original result was so spicy that it overpowered everything.  I spent an hour trying anything I could to reduce the spice, using any technique google could teach me.  It still ended up too spicy...and my husband and I both like spicy food.  He could barely eat it, and he eats everything.  I will not make this recipe as is again.  It needs a lot of tweaking",
