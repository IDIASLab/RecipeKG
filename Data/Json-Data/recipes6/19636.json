They sopped up the bottom of their bowls with bread when there wasn't enough left to get into a spoon. Soooo delicious. But if you're using hominy add GARLIC POWDER to balance the flavor. Also I let this sit overnight in the fridge to thicken and then reheated to serve it on Thanksgiving. This made it even yummier! Major repeat!!!:-)",
