Shichimi togarashi is a Japanese seven-spice blend which includes ground red pepper...you can sub with any ground red pepper, like cayenne. Using the Japanese version gives it a different type of spicy flavor, but it will essentially be very similar. There's another spice called Ichimi togarashi, which is just ground red chile pepper. Please comment with any questions or let me know what you think!",
