Now the actual recipe of this that originated with a renowned Indian chef calls for a full cup of tomato sauce (omitting the water) with the cup of heavy cream so that is what I did and I loved it. He also states the use of olive oil instead of veg. oil so that is recommended as it is healthier. I use the full amounts of everything spices etc. I wouldn't change the amounts at all. It is a rich mouth-watering experience. Lovely and one of my new favorites. Not for the bland of palette. Great with a nice bread.",
