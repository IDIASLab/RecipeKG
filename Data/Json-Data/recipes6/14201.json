I simply used a pinch of it the amount that fits between my finger and thumb. I beat the butter and sugar with a whisk by hand as my appliance is broken but then when the flour came into play I switched to a spoon and then my hands which worked well. I rolled the dough on my flour sprinkled counter and cut the cookies with a beer glass and they came out nice and thin. I must say I loved the taste of the dough a lot so I ate some of it.;) One problem really is the lack of a time frame but I went with the regular 12 minutes most thin cookies need and that was fine. This is why I only rate 4 stars the 1/8 teaspoon (which is technically almost un-measurable in this way) and the missing baking time. I just burned the lower sheet a little because it wasn t evident when looking at them from the top that they were already done. Next time I will put them onto a higher rack in the oven and I m sure they will be fine. They are awesome with milk and I am sure they are great with coffee tea chocolate milk and the like as well. My man immediately loved them.",
