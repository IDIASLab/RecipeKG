It turned out REALLY good and REALLY spicy.  I cut my potatoes in approximately 1-1/2\" chunks, and microwaved them about two-thirds as long as suggested.  It seemed to me that if I put them into an oven for 20-25 minutes AFTER they were done, they would be a soggy mess.  Anyway, they turned out great.  I had some half-cooked cauliflower that I rolled around in the sauce and put in the oven with the potatoes.  They tasted good, but the texture was mushy.   I have recently discovered Korean chile paste and am a big fan.  Yum!",
