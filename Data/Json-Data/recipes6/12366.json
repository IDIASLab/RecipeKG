I didn't notice the review about pressing down the little dough balls so I just left them round and baked them (thinking they would spread out) but they didn't. What I had were a bunch of little cookie balls. There was no way I could make a sandwich out of them since they were so puffy so I got a little creative...I put the filling in a pastry decorating bag and piped little designs on the top of my cookie balls. They looked so cute like little white truffles. I will definetly make these again and maybe change the food coloring color and decorate these with the filling on top since they looked and tasted so perfect. I bet you could also keep them puffy and drizzle some melted white chocolate over them also. For the actual recipe my only minor changes were to use 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of the 1 tsp of lemon (didn't have any on hand) and I also put about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest in the cookie dough (not just the \"filling\" - topping). They were soooo tasty! I'm only giving 4 stars because the recipe did not mention shaping and flattening the dough balls.",

The next time I make them though, I think I'll roll them into 3/4\" or 1/2\" balls to make a smaller cookie that you just pop in your mouth. They were a little messy to take several bites of because of the confectioners sugar. Another note to those trying the recipe.. mine didn't spread at all in the oven (which is alright) Just to keep in mind .. the shape & size they are going in the oven will be the same coming out.

Next time I will cram as much of the filling in as humanly possible because it was soooo good. I also didn't worry about the icing powder on the top they still looked lovely.
