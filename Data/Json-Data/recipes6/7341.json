I used a meat hammer and pounded the breasts out just a bit. Not into cutlets, but just enough to tenderize them. Then I salted and peppered them, and seared them in a cast iron skillet. I followed the recipe exactly from there, except I cut the cook time down and checked them with a meat thermometer until they registered 165F. It took about 30 mins. Served with onion cous cous and roasted asparagus.  5 stars for this one because it turned out excellent, and I can't say that my method is better than the original instructions seeing as how I've never tried it. I changed it because (in my experience), searing chicken first produces a better final product after baking.",
