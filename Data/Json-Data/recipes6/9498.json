With all of the ingredients, this kept saying to me that a sprinkle of oregano or basil would be appropriate, so I did add a bit of oregano.  I used chunk albacore packed in water, and left it pretty chunky.  I liked the tang, the texture, the ease of preparation, the freshness, simply liked everything about this gourmet salad.  I can see this hitting the dinner table often this summer with a cup of soup. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to serve it to houseguests. Thanks for sharing your recipe, we thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Romano?) and the hard boiled egg isn\u2019t on the ingredient list, just in the picture. \n\nChicken or shrimp could be substituted, but I liked the tuna cuz it was different. \n\nThe person who said it\u2019s not a correct Salad Ni\u00e7oise, I don\u2019t think this recipe was trying to copy a Ni\u00e7oise.
