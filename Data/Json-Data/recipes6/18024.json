For the cake version, I agree that you should make it in layers, rather than putting all the filling into the center.  As cupcakes, I used a pastry bag with a large tip, inserted it into the top of each cupcake and filled until I saw the top of the cupcake rise.  I dipped the top of each cupcake into the glaze and let set before adding the white swirl.  I got 21 cupcakes, filling each 3/4 full and cooking for 18 minutes.  These are better made the day before.  Also, you really need to whip the filling mixture to incorporate all the ingredients well.",

Don't use milk chocolate use semi-sweet. the milk chocolate never really dried they just stayed shiney sticky and were too sweet. 2nd in the instructions where it says to whip the white center for four minutes I think it should be more like 8-10 that's how long it took for mine to get really fluffy.",

So I spooned the filling into a decorator's bag and pipped the filling into the cake. I made several holes on top of the cake (I had flipped the cake upside down on a cake plate). Please use the tip that is the most narrow as you do not want big holes at the top of the cake. I must of had about 25 small holes from the nozzle of the bag placing just enough filling making the cake rise a tad. I was able to use all the filling into the cake. I then went and let the cake set while I did the frosting. For the frosting I put more of the chocolate chips in then what I orginally posted the recipe at most likely about 1/2 cup more. This cake is a must for the frig it seems to be more abundance with flavor when it sets for about 2-3 hours. I hope this helps someone. Try using cupcakes! and dip them in the frosting let cool on tray. WOWZA Enjoy everyone Cheryl @ the three dog kitchen",

As stated in some reviews that it was not as dry as the real ding dong. It is because you didn't bake it long enough. Made two batches and one was left in the oven for 15mins longer than the other and this is where i found one was dryier than the other. Also i think next time i make this i think i will make it into a jelly roll that you can get from the stores and it tastes like the ding dongs too. over all i think it is best when the cake sits in the refidgerator for at least 12 hours before you eat it. Way better when you wait for it. Thanks for the recipe...it is a definate keeper!!!",

I used 2 9-inch pans instead of a 10 inch--that way I wouldn't have to scoop out the inside. I think it would be great using 3 pans...made like a torte. A couple of things I've learned...make sure you take the top layer off of the cooked milk/flour combo. It doesn't fully beat into the filing mixture otherwise. Also I put this immediately into the fridge once I've filed it and it sets quite a bit while the topping is made. I plan to make chocolate cookies fill them with the filing and covered them with the chocolate. I think those will be fabulous too!! Oh yeah it melts quickly in the heat so if it's hot where you are don't take it out until you serve it. Great cake!!!",

I would recommend that you not skip steps and try to use a pre-made filling like cool-whip or whatever. The filling is really nice because it is a cooked frosting essentially so it is not terribly sweet and definitely not grainy so you don't get a cavity per bite!! Just be sure to get the milk and flour thick like paste before taking it off the heat. I thought everything tasted fine with the shortening but I will try to experiment with replacing it for health reasons. Finally I also added the hostess cupcake swirl on the tops since I made cupcakes. They turned out really cute. To make the swirl I mixed a couple tablespoons of butter with about a half cup of powdered sugar and a dash of vanilla and milk (I really hate store-bought frosting and that is so easy anyway). To pipe it I just put it in a plastic baggie and snipped the corner off. Also I thought they tasted better after they sat overnight since the flavors melded together more. Overall excellent idea will do again. So little effort for such a great result!!",

If you taste test right away it won't be as good. At least wait til they chill in the fridge. I piped frosting in the middle....used a number 3 wilton tip pushed 1/2 inch down piped til the cupcake plumped up. Super yummy!",
