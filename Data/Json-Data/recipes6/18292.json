I could not even stir the batter, it was so thick, and so added a splash of milk -- worked like a charm.\nThese muffins were not light and fluffy as others attested to, no doubt because of the whole wheat, butter, and extra nuts.  They were hearty, tasty, and very satisfying.  We  will make these often!",

I substitute 1 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 shredded apple and one shredded carrot for 1/2 C of the zucchini. I also heap the t of cinnamon and have switched to pumkin pie spice (as I was out of nutmeg). It adds a little zing and they are super moist! IQF them on a cookie sheet for about 10 minutes after they are completely cooled and then throw them in a Ziploc for easy storage. When someone wants one zap it at 50% power for 30 sec and full power for 15. It's just like they were straight out of the oven! Thanks for this one!",

Instead of all white flour I use 1 1/4 white 1/2 cup of whole wheat 1/2 c flaxseed meal and 1/2 c wheat germ. I left the sugars the same and used 2 heaping tsp. of cinnamon and 1 heaping tsp. of nutmeg. I used probably more like 1 2/3 cup of shredded zucchini which I squeezed out first. The same amount of milk and salt and real butter rather than shortening (I don't do fake foods). These muffins were OUT OF THIS WORLD. I'd never had zucchini muffins before so I was surprised at the nice sweet taste these had. I will make these again and again.",
