I added 2 cups of frozen cherries (the grocery store did not have any fresh ones at the time) because I thought this would taste better. Next time I think I will add even more cherries or maybe replace the water/buttermilk with cherry juice to enhance the flavor. I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 1/2 oz of chocolate to the frosting. I also made the frosting with fresh 100% cherry juice so it would have a fresh rather than canned flavor.",

I decorated the top with cherries..this cake would be beautiful elegant and tasty enough for any occasion. I've made it many times and there is never a crumb left over!",

I used butter instead of shortening in the cake batter and 3/4cup 100% cherry juice in place of the water and a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 cups of frozen cherries in place of the maraschino cherries. When it came to the frosting I used 100% cherry juice and used way more than 1/3 cup. I used 4oz instead of 1oz of the chocolate in the frosting and 1 tsp of vanilla extract in place of the almond. I also had to heat the frosting on top of a double boiler to get it smooth and creamy since it was a disgusting lump when the frosting ingredients were cold. Now for the taste...it was very chocolately and fudgy. Next time I would perhaps add something to make the cake a little moister but not sure what...maybe applesauce or a little oil.",
