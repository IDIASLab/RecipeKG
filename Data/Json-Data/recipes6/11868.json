And a  dab of food coloring paste will tint them well. These are wonderful, and you can make many variations. Also, the dough AND the cookies  freeze very well; just don't pack them too tightly or they'll crumble (...but then you can use the cookie crumbs for a parfait, with ice cream or pudding! )  \nDon't miss out- these are the easiest and most popular cookies I make. Also, they're delicate enough to make for a shower, etc. I've made little blue and/or pink ones for showers, and small pink heart cookie press ones for Valentine's Day.",
