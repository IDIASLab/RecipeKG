A friend of my parent's had us over for dinner and this is the only thing I actually remember having that night. My mom got the recipe from her that night and we've had it ever since. Her recipe didn't have celery in it but I'm sure it's just as good. The only thing I wanted to add here is that when I make it I use 2 tablespoons of oil instead of 1/4 cup (you could probably omit it completely). Splenda works well in place of the sugar and I only use half a green bell pepper. You could even use more carrots this makes a lot of juice for two pounds of carrots.",
