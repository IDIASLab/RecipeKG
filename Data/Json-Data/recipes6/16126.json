Using Tunisianswife's suggestions (see her Mediterranean Black Olive Bread review), I proofed the yeast in 1 cup of warm water mixed with the 1 tsp of sugar; added the flour (I used A.P.) and mixed in the remaining ingredients. I kneaded the mixture on a floured surface and probably added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour by the time all was kneaded in. Like Tunisianswife, I did 3 risings on this bread, kneading in between, and using her steam-baking idea, baked in a 450 oven (with a pan of water at the bottom to provide steam) for the first 15 minutes, then reduced to 400 & baked another 10-15 minutes. I agree with reviewer Tanaquil as to the texture and gourmet quality of this bread. I have baked breads for many, many years but this is one of the finest I've ever baked. I used 1 T fresh rosemary. The rosemary is a fragrant and subtle addition to the flavor. I was concerned about the amount of garlic, but it was perfect--it baked into mellow goodness. The texture was a soft but chewy interior and crusty exterior that sliced beautifully. My family has requested I make another loaf this week and let it be the meal!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe, in my opinion, is another one that really deserves much more than five stars. Wow!  This is a new favorite!  I did pre-measure the 17 tablespoons of water and found that to be roughly 1 and 1/3 cups water.  When the kneading cycle first started up, I found that I had to add about 1/2 cup to 3/4 of a cup of an additional amount of flour.  (I did this slowly, about 1 tablespoon at a time.)  Aside from that, I made this exactly as written and it came out tender and soft with an amazing crumb texture.  For anyone having trouble with the dough not rising, as per some other reviewers suggested, it might be a good idea to proof the yeast first.  Also, make sure that the water you add is neither too hot, nor too cold, as both will affect whether or not the dough rises.  If it's too cold, the yeast will not be activated, and if it's too hot, the yeast will be killed.  A good temperature for bread recipes that call for warm water is somewhere between 110 and 115 degrees.  A thermometer comes in real handy for this reason.  One last suggestion is to make sure that any salt the recipe calls for does not come into direct contact with the yeast.  Always add salt to the liquid ingredients first, and always add the yeast last.  Once all of the ingredients are in my machine, I make a small well with a spoon on top of the dry ingredients and pour the yeast into that well.  I hope these suggestions are helpful.  ",
