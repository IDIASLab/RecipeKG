If you like the tartness and your berries are on the ripe side I recommend upping the berries to more like 2 1/2 cups and use a a full size 9 inch pan. Also you might crush about one cup of them before sugaring to keep so many from floating on top of the sour cream..mmm mmm good!",

However everything solidified beautifully and it was quite tasty - I have quite the sweet tooth so it's perfect for me but if you're not a big fan of sugar then I would suggest lessening the amount of sugar by a bit. Also I found that it needs many more gooseberries (I upped it to 1 1/2 cups and it still wasn't enough)",
