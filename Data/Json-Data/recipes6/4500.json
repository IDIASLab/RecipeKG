But I think it's unfair to criticize baked potatoes because they aren't prime rib or pound cake.\n\nI find this recipe really, really good, just as it appears here.  I have made it dozens of times as an accompaniment to Middle Eastern food. to rave reviews.\n\nHowever, if you want bland and soupy, look elsewhere, or make the alterations others suggest as \"improvements.\"",

Even with that reduction it is a tad dry so you might want to add 1 or 2 T. extra broth. (The dried fruits absorb some of the liquid leaving less for the couscous and making it a tad on the dry side.)",
