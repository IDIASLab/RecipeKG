I used 2 3/4 cups flour zest of 3 large lemons 1/2 cup canola oil and almost a full cup of fresh squeezed lemon and let it sit in the frig overnight only because I was too tired to bake them the same day. I used two spoons to place dough on cookie sheet by the 1/2 teaspoon only. (Scoop up mixture with one spoon and scrap off with the other). I baked for 8 minutes as I wanted soft cookies. Very delicious tangy but sweet mixture. So freckin' good if you loooove lemon!!!",

I cut down a lot on the oil (about 50ml) and used the juice of 2 huge lemons to compensate on liquid. I also chilled the dough for a bit before baking although I don't know if it needed this. They came out beautifully not too flat and with a light golden brown edge. The taste is very \"zingy\" great for a lemon lover like myself.",

This first batch took forever to cook--it seemed like almost 20 minutes, although I stopped counting after a while and just looked at the cookies...  I ended up refridgerating 2/3 of the dough, and when I took it out six hours later, a lot of the oil had come out of the dough.  It turned out to be a good thing because they seemed to bake faster than the first batch (12 minutes for pretty crisp cookies after cooling).  I would suggest about 1/2 cup of oil instead of the 3/4 cup from the recipe.  Otherwise, the cookies turned out pretty well, kind of like crunchier lemon bars.  Like lemon bars, they turn out pretty tart, and could use a sprinkling of powdered sugar to balance the tartness (I also didn't use the lemon zest, because of personal preference, but I used more pulp in the cookie instead).",

I use the recipe EXACTLY as shown.  Some hints to make the cookies turn out well are:  1.  Keep the cookies on the small side.  They do flatten, just like all \"snap\" cookies do.  2.  Leave the cookies on the sheet for five minutes or so after they are done cooking.  It will help them slide off the pan much easier.  (When using baking stones, as I do, there's no need to grease the stone if it's seasoned.)  3.  Defenitely use the zest along with lemon juice.  You don't need any fancy gadget to zest, just use a cheese grater.  ENJOY!",

I had hoped it would have been a little more tart; I will try to add a bit more lemon juice and decrease the sugar the next time. Or perhaps using lemon extract instead of vanilla. I did 50-50 melted butter and vegetable oil ('cause I wanted a buttery taste)--worked fabulous. I've already gotten a request for this recipe!",

Usually they spread out get gooey stick like taffy to your baking sheet and then sometimes they turn out wonderfully. Wonderful did not happen with these cookies. My only advice since the taste is decent keep your cookies small. Small and less oil. Also when removing from the sheet. Cool them at least 5 mins first. Then take the side of your spatula and in short QUICK movements transfer the cookie to the cooling rack. I wish you the best. Some will love this and some will curse it!",
