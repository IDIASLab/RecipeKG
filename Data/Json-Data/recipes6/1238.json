I used 16 oz of Guiness and 20 oz of fresh apple cider and had no Granny Smith just used the little red apples that I had (didn't need to cook them as long as they were a softer variety). Waiting for the onion to brown was almost torture...can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for the awesome recipe!",

I made half recipe using a one pound pork tenderloin and wish I would have used a two pound tenderloin. I used Johnny Appleseed Hard Apple Cider (5.5% alc/vol) in this dish. When I walked thru the door after work I didn't like the smell and was totally worried about our dinner. I shredded the meat and put it back in the slow cooker for another 2 hours as I had plans. When I got home I proceeded with the recipe again worried about the cinnamon in the apple/onion topping. Well I had NOTHING to worry about - my husband and I loved this sandwich! I don't care for cooked apples but they work with this combination. All the flavors work nicely together. I served this on mini ciabetta rolls along with boiled potatoes and fresh fruit. coldstar37 I think the group chose a great recipe for Recipe Group even if I am a week behind in making it. It is a winner in our house and one I will be making again.",

The one \"flaw\" I found in the recipe is that it takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to caramelize onions and my stove was turned up higher than medium-low!. Next time I would probably only use 2 bottles of the hard cider - or even maybe Mots For Tots apple juice. And throw in another 1/2 an onion and a couple more apples. I took Saveur's suggestion and served them on pretzel buns (=",
