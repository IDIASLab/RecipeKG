A couple of tips--be sure, so that your egg mixture doesn't curdle (it's supposed to be smooth)cook it only on medium. Do not be tempted to get it boiling faster by turning up the heat, or you'll have a mess!  Also, I made a couple of test cookies since I read the reviews about how bad they turned out, and I decided to press the dough into a mini muffin pan.  Fill each muffin space about halfway full, then press a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon into the center to form the hole.  You can then shape the dough around your hole to help get a better look.  Fill the hole with the icing mixture, and bake.  You'll get cuter cookies that can't spread since they are confined to the muffin cups! These do taste good, and I  may use a more chocolatey cake next time for better color & flavor.  My brother-in-law (the sole reason I made these) loved them, as he is a huge German chocolate cake fan.",

The coconut/pecan topping was actually really easy to make from scratch, and not overly sweet like the canned versions.  I added 1/2 cup of flour to the cookie batter as suggested by the other reviewers, and chilled the dough before making the cookies and in between batches - they came out beautifully.  My husband loves German Chocolate Cake so I can't wait for him to try these!  \n\n** I've made these cookies multiple times and found that added about 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter makes it even better and brings out more of the chocolate flavor!  :)",

Someone I adore loves German Chocolate Cake, but he also lives far away.  :(  GCTC to the rescue.  At first I snickered at the thought of using a cake mix for the cookie dough.  Then I felt a little devilish at the thought of getting away with it.  The first batch valiantly gave itself in the name of research.  My sister dedicated herself to scrutinizing the cookie batter while her husband choked down the filling.  After passing reviews, batch #2 was apparenly abducted by aliens while setting up in the fridge.  Batch #3 turned out beautifully, and was packed and on its way to the object of my affection.  Without even trying the originally recipe, I followed the pack and added the 1/2 c flour to the cookie batter.  I also refrigerated the dough overnight and used a sorbet scoop to portion the dough and a small melon baller to hollow out an indentation for the filling.  Save yourself alot of grief and just make a double batch to begin with so half can be devoured \"raw\" and the other half can make it to the oven.",

Batch #2: I significantly cut the amount of filling I added to the cake mix hoping the cookies wouldn't be so flat and spread so much. No appreciable difference. These taste great -- unique blend of crunchy and chewy. My guests adored them and asked for the recipe! But beware: they spread a LOT. Even making them in 1\" balls yields a 3\" cookie. I had a lot of filling left over after Batch #1 and even more with Batch #2 and froze it for I-don't-know-what. The only way I'd improve them would be to somehow make them not as flat. Perhaps adding 50% more coconut and nearly that much more pecans would help bulk them up. Whatever I highly recommend these. They're addictive: be sure to make more than enough for what you need because you'll end up eating several while they're still warm from the oven. Mmmmm!",

I did end up taking some of the ugly cookies to work and one lady said they were the best cookies she had ever had! NOTE-I am high altitude about 7000 above sea level so not sure if they flattened due to that. I may try baking powder next time.
