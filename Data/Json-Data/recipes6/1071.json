Years ago I made this for my kids--without a recipe to follow from the book, and because I always use apples in my Stuffing, I went with typical stuffing seasonings, Sage being a key player of flavor. It was pretty good eating!  \n\nI tried this sweet and spicy version today and love it! We enjoy the health benefits of cinnamon, so I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and cut the sugar down to 2 TBLS.  I used Macintosh apples. And a dash of salt.",
