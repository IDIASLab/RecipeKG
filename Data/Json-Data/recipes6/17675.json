I gotta say I was quite skeptical when I poured the cake mixture onto the crust. I increased oven temperature to 260 F and bake it for 1 hour after decreasing the temperature. When cooled the cake looked perfect. I spread jelly on the top and I became skeptical again: wouldn't it be to much? Wouldn't it \"cover\" the cheesecake taste? NO: this cake turned out perfect not too nutty not too sweet and very fresh. I'll surely make it again keeping in mind that temperature has to be slightly increased as well as cooking time.",
