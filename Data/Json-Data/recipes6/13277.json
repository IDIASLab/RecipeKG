Rather than slicing the peaches she would cut them in half and put them in the uncooked pie shell face up. Then she would stuff the gaps between the halves with any remaining peaches cut into chunks. The recipe works every time when I make it this way. And it tastes quite different the sugar cream and juices become firmer like a custard and the flavor is much fresher! Mmmmm!",
