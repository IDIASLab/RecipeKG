Love that this goes directly from the freezer into the pot, and in a very short amount of time, you have a tasty main course.  Great weeknight meal!  I wanted a thicker sauce, so I did a cornstarch slurry on low saute on the Instant Pot\u00ae for a couple minutes, then put the chicken back in to infuse the teriyaki flavor for a few minutes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I\u2019d make this again.",
