                "reviewBody": "4.25.20  Followed this recipe to the letter, and it turned out pretty well.  But here are a couple things that I will do differently in the future.  A ciabatta roll is simply too much bread for a 4-oz turkey burger, and it\u2019s just too chewy. I\u2019ll use a good quality hamburger bun in the future. Also, I assembled exactly as written in this order:  pesto mayo top and bottom bun, burger patty on bottom, slice of red onion, and romaine.  This sandwich was hard to eat because the bread was so chewy that you really had to bite down hard, and then everything starts to slide off.  Even if you decide to use a ciabatta roll, would recommend  pesto mayo top and bottom bun, lettuce on the bottom, red onion, and burger. patty on top.  Two teaspoons of salt for 1 pound ground turkey made the burgers too salty for me (sodium count in nutrition info is 1,965 mg), and I\u2019m even a salt lover. Whew, wish I'd seen that before making this, would have cut back the salt back! The garlic and basil in the burger is very tasty, and the pesto mayo works beautifully on this sandwich. Yes, several tweaks for me, but I\u2019d make again.",
