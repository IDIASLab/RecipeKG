But I don't know what I was thinking when I mixed a hot egg yolk/sugar mixture in with of all things a shortening/butter mixture. It did exactly what I expected it to - it melted and looked much like cake batter. (Kind of tasted like it too) I can only think my lapse in judgment was because I blindly trusted the recipe. I put the frosting in the fridge and checked it periodically until it was firm enough to work with and it ultimately turned out fine. But if you do make this by all means let your yolks and sugar mixture cool down to room temperature before mixing it into the butter and shortening! After all the monkeying around with this and the fact that it's a little too chocolatey for me I'm not sure I'll bother with this one again. My three star rating is basically for the instructions which essentially make this fail until you \"fix\" it.",
