When I made this today I cut down the recipe to 14 servings (4 rolls) in case it didn't turn out. It turned out great. I left the dough in a ball to rise for several hours (my fast rising yeast must have been on strike). Then I formed the rolls and poked it with a fork to let the steam escape before cooking. I brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out of the oven. They really weren't much trouble at all to make on a small scale. Hopefully the picture I sent will show how good they look!",
