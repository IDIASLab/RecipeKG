I used chili peppers instead of jalapenos (on accident) and it was very good and about medium level spicy...no one believed habanero was in there (only slight slow burn)! Several people wanted the recipe. The second time I made this today I cut the recipe in half and I used some of my grandpa's garden tomatoes (that had been peeled diced and frozen) and used a kitchen scale to weigh the right amount. I still used a whole habanero 1 jalapeno and one small chili and it was hot! My husband loves it even more now and I'm going to give a little to my grandpa for Christmas too (he likes spicy as well)! This recipe is great and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes hot or medium salsa as it can be either depending on what peppers and how much habanero you use relative to the scale.",
