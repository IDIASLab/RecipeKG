Using solely whole wheat flour (eliminated the all-purpose flour) gave these a nuttier flavor, but they were so light and fluffy.  I substituted 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter and used 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp. Splenda instead of sugar.  I used skim milk instead of the dry milk powder and water and also added 2 tsp. flax seed and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  If the batter is too runny, it can be thickened with a little extra flour.  These freeze and reheat very well for a quick and filling breakfast.  Great with no-sugar maple syrup and turkey sausage links!!",

My changes are: 1 1/2 C non-fat buttermilk and 3/4 C water instead of milk powder and water (I actually increased the water even more because my family likes thin pancakes with crisp edges but for most it would probably be too thin). I also decreased regular flour from 1 C to 1/2C and then added 1/4C flax seed meal 1/4C wheat germ. Added about a teaspoon of cinnamon too. Like other reviewers I cut way down on the sugar (to slightly less than 1/2 C and also used honey for most of the sweetener). These were excellent pancakes. My husband is usually leery of the taste of non-traditional pancakes but he gave it high praise. And my children gobbled them up. This has become my preferred pancake recipe!",

I made three small changes; I used all whole wheat flour I upped the baking powder to 3 teaspoons and I only used just under a 1/4 cup of sugar. I might cut back the sugar even more next time but these were awesome. Really light and fluffy and just......AWESOME. This might be my new go-to pancake recipe. NOTE: This recipe makes a TON so if you're like me you can freeze the pancakes in batches on a flat baking sheet and portion out into freezer bags for days you don't want to make a hot breakfast from beginning to end.",
