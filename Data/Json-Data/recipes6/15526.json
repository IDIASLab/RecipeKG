Despite all the blueberries which usually are the dominant flavor when mixed with other stuff it just tasted like a slightly blueberry-flavored milk. (Like chocolate milk made very weak.) I didn't taste nectarine at all. I wonder if smoothies just go better when they have milk yogurt or juice... something besides just fruit cause the last one I made w/little liquid was very bland as well. I added a bunch of juice concentrate to it to get some flavor. And it badly needs some liquid. I don't see why not just add some milk instead of just powder. Because of the lack of liquid it was also extremely difficult to blend. If you scrape the sides a lot and blend forever it does finally mix (and the ice turn to water) but it was difficult. Sorry won't be making again.",
