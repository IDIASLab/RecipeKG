I made this for the 4th of July when I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any canned beans to have with dinner. I used 2 cans pinto beans (because that's what I had on hand) substituted honey for the molasses (because we didn't have any) reduced the brown sugar to 1/2C. and omitted the bacon because I didn't want to wait for it to thaw. I didn't have time to bake them so I cooked them on the stovetop for about 40 minutes while waiting for my husband to cook the hot dogs. Next time I will definitely do them in the crock pot or oven as the beans were a little too firm. But the flavor was PERFECT!",
