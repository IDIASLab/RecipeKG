I had a hard time finding canned or jarred French Chestnuts after the holidays were over, but then found them at Treasure Island by Rolands in a glass 14 oz jar which was perfect.  I think next time I would use a bit less water (maybe half a cup less)since it was a bit too watery.  Also, I made basmati rice and served the stew on the rice which was perfect to soak up the juices/liquid of the stew.  After dinner, I put the left over rice into the pot with the leftover stew and it heated up great over the next couple of days.  I'll definitely make it again and serve it with rice again.  Yummy!",

This stew initially came out a bit watery and unappetising and reminded me of my attempts at cooking as a student in the 70s. So I cooked it in the oven at a low temp for another couple of hours ie total of 3 - 4 hours. Then I used a potato masher at the end to mash things up slightly and mingle flavours. I also added fresh herbs (thyme and sage because I had them in the garden) and a glass of red wine before putting it in the oven. Next time I'll probably leave out or reduce the water. So my tweaked version was more de luxe and took longer to cook. It was gorgeous.",
