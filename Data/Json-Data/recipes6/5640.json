Used 2 serrano (seeds/ribs and all) instead of jalapeno. Otherwise kept to the recipe (well I was heavy handed with the chili powder and thyme). This is fantastic. Be careful not to overcook the chayote it has such a delightful texture. I really made this highly seasoned and in doing so the sweet refreshing \"cucumbery\" flavor of the chayote was lost. That was my fault not that of the recipe. Still the texture works and I'll be happily eating these leftovers and making this again and again.",
