Went Fantastic. 2nd batch I figured I'd use fresh herbs--disaster. I chopped them way too coarse and got 'wood' in my salad. I thought about trying to save it by draining the bean mixture and straining the dressing to return to salad but never got around to it. Will use dried for sure and maybe a little more sweet onion for zip. A keeper!:-)",
