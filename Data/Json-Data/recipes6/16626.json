Since I try to stay away from as much processed sugar as I can (no always sucessful with that...lol) I went ahead and left that out but still was soooooo yummy. I stirred the seasonings into the cream and tossed the cabbage and cream together in a mixing bowl before putting it in the casserole dish. Had an open(read:stale...lol) package of crackers in the cupbord so smashed them up to use for my crumb topping and added a little bit of parmasean to the top just to be creative. This recipe is always recieved well and is mostly goof-proof!",

Followed the recipe to the letter and used panko bread crumbs for the topping. It's just mellow creamy rich with a hint of freshly grated nutmeg. Don't tell the kids this is cooked cabbage because they'll never figure this one out. Thoroughly enjoyed this.",

I followed the directions to a tee, but after it was all said and done, I can't think of anyway to improve this recipes. I love creamed turnips and thought this might be like it, but it isn't.
