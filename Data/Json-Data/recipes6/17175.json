My orange was pretty sweet so subbed a pinch of stevia for 1 tsp sugar. There's almost no acidity in recipe so I added 1 Tbl rice wine vinegar. Following advice of previous reviewer added a little cracked black pepper. Let sit a couple hours and had a great dressing for tangy mesclun and grilled chicken paillard. But I can't stand people who change a recipe beyond recognition then rate it 5 stars because they ended up with something good. People can't we rate the written recipe not our experimentation?",
