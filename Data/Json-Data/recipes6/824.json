The first being that I didn't want the beer to overpower as others mentioned and the second being that I wanted the finished brisket firm enough to slice. From past experience I've found that if the meat is completely covered in liquid the end result is more of a shredded consistency. There's nothing wrong with that but it is not what we prefer. My potatoes were leftover from another meal so I had to tweak that step and just add them in the final minutes . The carrots and cabbage took on the flavor nicely but I do think 4 beers would have been too much. Overall this was a good recipe and one I would make again. If you don't like a strong beer flavor in your food I recommend cutting back as I did.",

I needed to continue cooking the veggies an extra 15 minutes but that may be because we're at high altitude.
