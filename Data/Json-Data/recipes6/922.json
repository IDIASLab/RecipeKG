I decided to try these on him and he was very happy! I did not change a thing except that I didn't have grape tomatoes only Roma so I quartered them and as they softened I flattened them. I also sprinkled pork seasoning on the chops before cooking. I think the bourbon adds a very nice flavor to them. Thanks so much for sharing Nattygirl will definitely be making again.",
