I made these just as the recipe directed, but found I only needed 2-1/2 T. of the cherry juice in the frosting to get the consistency I wanted. I chilled the baked bars briefly before cutting them, just long enough for them to set and be somewhat firm. So, so pretty, and perfect for Valentine's Day!

I cut them in to little tiny (like petite fours) squares because they are so rich. I did follow the advice of another reviewer and put them in the fridge before cutting and unfortunately this made them hard as a rock and really hard to cut.

I did follow the recipe exactly I chilled for about 60 minutes before cutting. I did find the cutting quite difficult they just kept oozing at the side and the chocolate constantly cracked. Personally I think it would be better to cut before drizzling with the chocolate sure it would give a more professional finish.
