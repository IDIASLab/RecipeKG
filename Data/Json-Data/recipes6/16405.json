As you can see, very versatile. Using whole wheat flour makes them very filling. For people on the go that want a quick healthy breakfast, that stays with you until lunch, this is perfect.

It's just horrible. I LOVE spice I tend to add half again as much cinnamon as is called for in most recipes but I cut back the amount of spice called for in this recipe and it still was ruined. I can't imagine how strong they would have been if I'd used 2 tsp. of each of them. I think the basic pumpkin part is a good recipe. The texture is good but the spice as I said is just TOO MUCH. Not good at all. Doesn't taste like pumpkin at all sorry.",
