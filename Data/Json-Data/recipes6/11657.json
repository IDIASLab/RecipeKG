I have dear friends that just love a good chocolate cake. I tried this recipe and and WOW! It was melt in your mouth delicious. The frosting was nice and thick and easy to spread. I have never had frosting turn out so well. I made a two layer quarter sheet cake because the single layer looked a bit small. The two layer was a giant and perfect for Christmas dinner! It was a little time consuming to make but well worth it. I made it a day ahead and it was perfect! I can not say enough good things about this cake!",

A couple of notes- the texture of this cake was interesting..very fine with concentrated flavor without being heavy. It was not the fluffy cake you'd get from a box...more refined and substantial like all the good things of an old fashioned cake combined with the moist denseness that hinted at a flourless cake (but again not heavy like that and not thick...like a silk texture). I followed the recipe to a tee except that I substituted hot very strong coffee for the water and used ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa with baking soda to substitute for the dutch process cocoa (the baking soda comps for the alkali in dutch process) The use of the coffee and gourmet cocoa most likely enhanced the flavor of the cake greatly. I used the recipe to make cupcakes baked for 39-40 minutes at the prescribed temperature. They came out perfectly..nice and springy-light. The frosting was a lovely recipe...not too sweet but still quite decadent. I am not much for super sweet frostings so that affects my assessment. There was frosting left over and my bf threatened to eat it with a spoon. This will be one of my \"secret weapon\" chocolate cake recipes for sure!",
