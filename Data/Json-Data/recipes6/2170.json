The texture was heavier than a cheesecake and never fully set up. The crust was also a little wet so it was difficult to get out of the pie pan. I made an unsweetened whip cream with a little vanilla to cut some of the sweetness.",

I crushed up some peanuts to mix with graham cracker for the crust and put down a layer of Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups on the crust before I poured the filling in.
