I made as written except for the fact I started with one egg only and no milk. I planned on adding milk as I went but it turns out I never needed and it was perfect without it. My husband loved these and even talked about them the next day. Oh and one more thing to note is that I was not able to find 6 oz. cans of tuna. They had 5 ounce (4 after drained) and 12 ounce cans. I used 2 5 ounce cans. Next time I will add some Old Bay but that is the only addition I will make. One helpful note is to freeze your tuna balls for 30 minutes before frying and that will help them hold their shape.",

I wanted to make it a little more Asian so I added a sprinkle of ginger and some toasted sesame seeds to the mixture. Also added a little sesame oil to the canola oil I fried them in.
