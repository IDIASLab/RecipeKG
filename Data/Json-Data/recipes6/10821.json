I am more of a 'from scratch' person but am finding wonderful recipes here by embellishing on mixes.  I had a can of blueberry pie filling I've been pushing out of the way forever.  Used a CLASSIC WHITE mix and BLUEBERRY filling.  used VANILLA EXTRACT instead of almond, and added 1/2 of LEMON'S ZEST to batter, as well as a handful of huge frozen blueberries. Don't be afraid of the batter.  It reminded me of a bed I made once in nursing school whereby you had to be able to bounce a quarter off it...very strange batter...spongy; bouncy..baked for 32 min in a bundt pan.  For frosting I halved the recipe and used WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS in lieu of the chocolate and added the remaining LEMON ZEST from the lemon....absolute perfection.  Due to less surface area, it was perfect to halve the frosting recipe for bundt.  I didn't taste the cake but the frosting is to die for...taking this to the dog groomer and she will love it coming from a little Shitzhu and Lhasa.",
