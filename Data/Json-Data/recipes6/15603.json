The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I adjusted the recipe.  I read the \"mushy\" complaints and decided to only use one banana.  They were perfect and had plenty of banana flavor.  Everything else in the recipe stayed the same.  I will say that it was a large banana so maybe that makes a difference.
