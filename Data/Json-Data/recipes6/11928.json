Not possible- the best you can do is saute the dates. (2.) After mixing everything together you are then supposed to roll it into balls. Yeah right! The mixture is far too soupy to roll anything. (3.) The cookies then stuck to the pans so much that the cookies could not be removed from the pans at all! I had to scrape the cookies off the pans & then spend the rest of the night scrubbing the pans clean.",

And it is the only date ball recipe I have found on this website without rice krispies (thank god!). Anyways I found these to be quite difficult to make. I was trying to surprise my grandmother for Christmas by making date balls cause they are her favorite but my mom and I lost her recipe. We didn't want to call her and ask so I tried using this one. There is something a little off about this recipe and I think it has to do with the initial step. The proportion of dates to water to butter seem to be off which is causing a consistency problem later. These don't maintain their ball shape very well in the oven or on the cooling rack and they are just too soft. Granted I haven't refrigerated them yet which will harden them considerably but they lose their shape too fast before I can get them in the fridge! I'm going to get my grandmother's recipe and post it on here. It is very similar to this just definitely not as messy and difficult. 5 stars for taste though!",
