Ready to eat in less than 2 hours after living up to close to high heat for 15 minutes or so to cook the meat faster. I was impressed how well the flavors from the seared meat and veggies went together. I also had to use veggie stock (also didn't have beef stock), but threw in 2 beef bouillon cubes while it was simmering. This one is going in the Fall/Winter night go-tos!",
