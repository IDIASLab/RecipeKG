I used half the meat - so essentially doubling the sauce (except for the salt) as all previous reviewers suggested. I added a half pound cooked crumbled Italian sausage to thicken it up. It helped.:) This is a slightly tangy sauce which I usually don't \"go\" for; but it was so subtle here I liked it. 'Also don't usually try ketchup (as a key ingredient) recipes - 'Couldn't detect it. Nice! I sauteed onion & garlic first then completed; thickened with cornstarch a t & a half. I'd add less water rather than thicken; 'can always add it if it's needed. As for the Italian sausage addition I liked it; but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",
