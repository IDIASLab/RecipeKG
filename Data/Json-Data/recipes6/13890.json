I just wanted to step back in and make a few comments for those who weren't satisfied.  It was mentioned that the dressing tastes like biting into a plain onion, and that it was hot, and another used a red onion and not all the sugar.  You will notice the onion ingredient says \"1/2 a SMALL onion\".  This would be approximately 1/2 cup chopped, and please do use a mild white onion.  The hot onion definitely makes the dressing hot and bitter.  The kind of onion used will affect the flavor of the dressing.  Another used just garlic salt and recommended not to use the extra salt.  The recipe doesn't call for garlic salt but garlic powder, which has no salt in it.  Yet another didn't use the onion at all, only an Italian seasoning packet.  In my opinion, to write a review on a recipe requires you follow the recipe as written and not make substitutions, otherwise you are writing a review on the recipe as you changed it.  I hope you continue to enjoy this fabulous dressing, and for those who didn't enjoy it, you might give it another chance using the instructions as written.  Then if you don't like it, you'll be entirely justified in your opinion!  Happy eating!",

                "reviewBody": "This dressing was really great - the key is to let it sit overnight before serving because once the flavors meld it is wonderful.  I did change the recipe a bit - I used bottled minced garlic rather than garlic powder and did not use onion in the dressing at all (because since I was using lots of onions in the salad it just wasnt necessary to have it in the dressing - and I thought that the garlic substitution made up for it).  The only thing I didnt like about this dressing was that I used dried Italian seasoning - maybe mine isnt a good brand or something but I though it made the dressing taste very fake-herby or something (although once you mix it with the salad you cant tell that).  Next time I will definitely use fresh herbs - basil, oregano, tarragon, parsley and rosemary - that makes it a little more expensive to make but it is so worth it to pack all of those fresh herby flavors into the dressing.  Recommendations for a great Italian salad to go with this dressing: Iceberg and Romaine lettuce, plum tomatoes, provolone cheese, broccoli, red onion, garbanzo beans, pepperoncini, roasted red peppers and homemade croutons (these are KEY - get really well seasoned fresh croutons from the farmers market).  I made an enormous amount of salad and my guests devoured all of it!",
