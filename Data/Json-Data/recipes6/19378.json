The soup is sweet enough, thick enough, as is. To be on the safe side I erred on the side of caution and used only half the amount of nutmeg called for and was happy with that - certainly better than had I added too much and hated it!  Rather than the canned tomatoes (which would be wonderful too!) I used tomatoes I had put up from my garden. I also added what might be one of the last times I'll get to use fresh chopped parsley and basil from my garden.  Since I scaled this down to two servings I wasn't about to open a carton of heavy cream for a mere two tablespoons, and the half and half I used instead was just fine.  This was brilliant red, intensely tomato-y and incredibly fresh tasting. Along with \"Club Sandwich Salad,\" also from this site, it was a tasty, nutritious and satisfying soup and salad supper.",

I served this with cheesy bread (a baguette halved and cut into 4ths with butter garlic powder and shredded mozzarella in the oven at 425 degrees until browned and bubbly) which would also make good cheese croutons for this soup if you cut it into bite-sized squares. As an FYI the Muir Glen brand of organic canned fire-roasted tomatoes does not contain BPA in the lining as many other brands do. The acidity of tomatoes causes the thin plastic lining they use in cans to leach BPA making it one of the strongest sources of leached BPA in foods. So it's good to buy Muir Glen if you can find it especially if you have little ones at home like I do.:)",
