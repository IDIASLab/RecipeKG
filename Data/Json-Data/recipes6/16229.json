I primarily followed the recipe, but made the following modifications:  1.  skipped the cognac and used only peach schnapps and 1 Black Box sauvignon blanc wine (equals 4 bottles).  2.  Added 6 sliced fresh peaches, 2 sliced ripe mangoes, 2 pints of strawberries, 2 sliced oranges, and 2 sliced lemons.    Put mixture evenly in 2 covered pitchers and let it sit in fridge for 2 days, stirring occasionally.  Turned a beautiful light peachy/pink color.    Served over ice in individual glasses, topped off with gingerale (3/4 sangria, 1/4 gingerale) according to individual taste in each glass.  (No punch bowl)  Enough for several days of drinking, so don't dilute with gingerale until serving time.  I even drank a glass on day 3 without any gingerale and it was amazingly good.  Unbelievably delicious!  Tasted even better on the third day...and the boozy soaked fruit was YUMMY to eat.",

The secret to any good sangria relies less on the ingredients than it does one very important factor - TIME!  When I make any sangria I usually make it the night before the party (or first thing the morning of).  The longer you allow the fruits and liquids sit the better flavor you have!  (Stir occasionally!)  Just remember your ginger ale (or whatever soda you add) is to be mixed in just before serving.  Time is one ingredient any good sangria simply cannot do without!",
