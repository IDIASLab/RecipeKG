When they became fragrant I added about a tablespoon of EVO and mixed then added the onion and minced garlic and saut\u00e9ed until tender and translucent. I added the water and broth along with the lentils and followed the recipe from there until we got to the kale and peas. I steamed those separately to retain their bright green color. I did mix the peas into the grain mixture and served it over the kale. The other change I made was to use regular quinoa since there is neither nutritional advantage nor additional flavor in the rainbow and it was almost twice as expensive. When I saw how muddy this cooked up I was happy with that decision. Thank you Heather.",
