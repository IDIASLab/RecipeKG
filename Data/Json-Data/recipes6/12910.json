They turned out to be the most attractive out of 8 different cookies that my granddaughter and I made for Valentine cookie trays. We had several comments about how pretty and unusal they were. (People were surprised by the light rose scent.) These cookies will be a standard on our trays now. Thank you J. I love this recipe.",

Debated using butter for shortening but wanted the rose essence to come through so used crisco instead. upped the rosewater to 2 tsp. and tinted with red food coloring. Used the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar to flatten and used green sprinkles for the 'stem'. With the bit of white sugar left from the glass it gave the 'bud' a pretty sparkle. rosewater that I used was homemade and is a bit stronger than the 'Swad' brand sold in stores. Could easily sub rosewater for orange blossom water. thanks for the recipe and will make a pretty and interesting cookie to give away to the neighbors. As made above these would make for a lovely presentation for a bridal shower.",
