I used three very large garlic cloves and half a large yellow onion. I used 2 and a half cups of chicken broth and a random spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge. I added the dry pasta after adding the spaghetti sauce and chicken broth. It came out soooo good. My husband had seconds. It was super tasty. The pasta absorbed all the delicious liquid. I signed in just to review this recipe. I will definitely be making it again.",
