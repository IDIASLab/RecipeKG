Spread caramel topping in pans:  1c melted butter, 1+1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c corn syrup.  Sprinkle chopped macadamia nuts and coconut over topping.  Put rolls in pans, cover and let rise until double (30 - 40 min).  Bake at 350 for 30 to 35 min.  Let cool in pans 5 min, turn over onto a platter or cookie sheet covered with parchment and let caramel run over rolls before removing the pan.  Seriously decadent...people are begging for more.",

Never having tasted that, I can only imagine....but I will tell you it was wonderful with full flavor and very good texture. I let my bread machine go thru the dough cycle, then I took the dough out and formed the loaf, baking it in a 9x5 loaf pan at 375 degrees for 33 minutes. PERFECT. It makes aromatic toast, too. Yummy. My hubby didn't enjoy it as much as I, he said it tasted too much like banana, well DUH! Maybe I'll cut the bananas to 1/4 cup for his sake next time.",

But my husband is not so crazy about coconut flavor so I made it with vanilla extract instead of coconut and he loved it! I make the dough in my bread machine and take it out and bake it in the oven for about 35-40 minutes. It comes out nicer and slice better. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!",

I added the ingredients one by one in a separate bowl whisking slowly(doubling the ingredients) until everything but the yeast and flour was combined.  I proofed the yeast with a couple of tbsp of water and added to the wet mix.  After mixing that in, I added flour slowly stirring... then kneading after 4 cups.  I got up to 5 1/2 cups flour for the double recipe.  At that point, I put the dough into a lightly greased bowl and put in the oven on about 100 degrees to rise.  I waited for about 1.5 hr, then formed the dough into 3 loaves and put into the 100 degree oven again to rise for another 1.5 hr. After that, I removed the 3 bread pans from the oven, preheated to 350, and baked for about 40 minutes.  VERY VERY GOOD!",
