I've made other risotto recipes before and it seemed fishy to me right off the bat.  Usually you have several times more liquid than rice, whereas here it's only 2 to 1.  My broth got sucked up so fast and my rice was so crunchy that I had to start adding hot water about halfway through.  It still came out well, though.  To summarize, I would suggest cutting down on the rice and pumping up the broth (at least a 3 to 1 ratio).",

                "reviewBody": "This dish is a great base to add to your recipe box that can take on many variations.  Risotto is such a comfort food if made correctly.  Pair it, as this does, with a protein (shellfish) and lots of veggies, including the fiber rich, spinach, and you\u2019ve got a great, warm & filling meal.  Suggestions for base: 1.\tUse a good quality broth for the rice to absorb.  Generally, the darker the broth, the greater the concentration of pure stock to other ingredients, typically added water and/or salt.  I like Kitchen Basics chicken broth.  It won\u2019t break the bank and offers a darker stock than its competitor. 2.\tI used a little over a 4:1 ratio of stock to rice as others have suggested, this works out to just over a full box of the stock.  The key is to stop adding broth only when the rice won\u2019t absorb any more.  When you start to feel like the rice won\u2019t absorb any more, decrease each \u201ctest\u201d addition so you don\u2019t end up with soup.  This should give you a nice, creamy texture. 3.\tI preferred cooking the shrimp & scallops in a saut\u00e9 pan separate from the veggies to get a nice, caramelized sear.  This will also prevent them from getting overcooked and loosing their moisture by sitting in the same pan with the veggies waiting to get done.  Saute until just opaque in color and then transfer and mix with the veggies.  Heat through.  Suggested Variations: 1.\tI added 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to the risotto for added depth. 2.\tTry adding a couple big handfuls of parmesan or ramano ch",

My rating is a 3 because the rice to broth ratio should be 3:1 or slightly more but here it is a little off. I used 5 cups broth to 1 and a half cups rice and it was almost just enough. Adding a little extra wine (Sauvignon Blanc) and water gave the rice just what it needed. To save money I excluded scallops and went with a half pound of shrimp (We are not big meatheads). I cooked through most everything accordingly except previously noted and it turned out delicious. I did not combine the veggies and rice but did plate the rice with the veggies on top (allowing the diner to eat as many veggies as they wanted. This meal was excellent and is coupled well with a homemade dry bread. The rich buttery flavor from the rice couples well with the leek and shrimp for a good finish to a good night.",

A little lemon at the end and some fresh chopped herbs over top for color would be about my only other suggestions. Personally I loved the dish big time. The next time I make it I'll be sure to use a 4:1 ration for rice/broth finish with some lemon and fresh herbs and I think it will be even better.",
