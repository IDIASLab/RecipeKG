I quit using shortening many many years ago and use butter instead. I always frost them using jiffy white frosting mix from a box the only thing I have ever used and I can no longer find it in store but it can be ordered online for.50 a box plus shipping (minimum 12 boxes). Just ordered more today lasts me a couple of years for these cookies and sugar cookies at christmas. I also add lemon to the cookie dough instead of almond extract and to the frosting and it makes them superb. I cook at 325 for 10 minutes. a little flour on your hands as you shape the cookies around the kiss helps plus refrigerating it beforehand and only removing a bit of dough from the frig at a time also helps and I mush the tip of the kiss too to make enclosing it easier and I have made using hershey chocolate nuggets too in place of kisses and no unwrapping lol. it just makes bigger cookies. these are also great to make put in the freezer on a cookie sheet or plate for a few minutes and then freeze in a freezer safe container to bake at a later date they can be baked frozen you might have to add a minute or so to the bake time just watch them closely. and whenever you bake them do not over bake.",
