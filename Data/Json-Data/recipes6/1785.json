I used apricots cranberries and some salted mixed nuts that I chopped fairly coarsely. As written I think they would be pretty thin and crunchy. I took mine out after 20 minutes instead of 30 and they are fairly soft but still stay together well. I think next time I will use a 9 x 13\" inch pan instead of a cookie sheet to make them a bit thicker. Great recipe!",

The notes I would make are if you want to have you oats almonds and coconut evenly roasted I would suggest you roast them in separate pans as the coconut ended up on the bottom and toasted a lot faster than the almonds and oats. I loved the cinnamon the flavor of it came out strong in the final product so keep that in mind if cinnamon is not your thing. And finally if you don't like the mouth feel of the whole oats or your mouth is too sensitive and finds them sharp try quick oats that have been broken up into smaller pieces. I've used this before in making oatmeal cookies for my grandparents and found it works really well. (note: haven't tried with this recipe yet update when I do)",
