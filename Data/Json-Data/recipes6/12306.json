I chose this recipe from the many sugar cookie recipes because of the two ingredients that differ from the other sugar cookies - powdered sugar & cream of tartar. Those two ingredients act as tenderizers in a way and the result is a light crunchy melt in your mouth cookie. So delicious. I used my metal ice cream scoop (that has the little release bar in it)and I simply scooped the dough onto the cookie sheet - then I sprinkled some colored sugar on top (didn't flatten them) and baked them. Sooo good! I had a recipe like this years ago and I lost it so I'm very glad to have found this one! One thing I should add though - these are not the kind of sugar cookies that would be good to roll out & cut with fancy cutters. The dough does not hold it's shape well enough for that.",

My husband loves them too! this is a wonderful cookie recipe. It makes a lot of cookies. Make sure you use real butter and not margarine and it definitely helps to refridgerate the dough over night. Also it works well when you roll the dough into balls roll in sugar and then make them flat with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. Also they look nice when you sprinkle on a little colored sugar to add some color. Great recipe thanks!",

I thought the recipe called for a bit too much oil and butter but I did use the exact amount. I added 2 cups of whole wheat flour in place of the regular..to try and add 1 healthy ingredient. I'll definitley keep searching for my danish wedding cookies. Thanks for sharing Alicia.",
