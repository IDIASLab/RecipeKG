I kept the 1 tsp cinnamon and used a total of 3 tsp of BROWN sugar. I blended this up in my Vitamixer. There wasn't any sugar crystals at all. I'm not sure if it was just the difference in sugar or the power of my blender. Anyhow it was runny at first. When I refrigerated it it turned into a more spreadable mixture. Next time I might use the full cup of cream cheese and use 1/2 cup cottage cheese. That might help the consistency and make it more like a cream cheese spread. I didn't mix any raisins in (per my picky 11 year old) but I'm sure it would be tasty. I used this with Bagels I recipe on this site. Thanks for the great recipe!",
