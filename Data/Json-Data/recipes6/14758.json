The only changes I would make next time would be to cut the amount of almonds in half and 1 less TBS of chili pepper flakes. I baked the chicken with the sauce (instead of doing it in the microwave) and served it over sticky white rice. This is a huge time saver from the recipes that take hours to prepare...and we like the taste of this one MUCH better. Thank you!!",
