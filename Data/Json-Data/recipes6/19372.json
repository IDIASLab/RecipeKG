It was simple and quick to put together as the turkey was resting. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and used a little cayenne and a little white pepper. I may increase the cayenne slightly the next time. As promised it thickened up beautifully but didn't get gloppy as it sat on the table. This was well liked by everyone and something that I will enclude in special future dinners. Thanks so much.",

We used to give out a card/recipe to those who asked for it but it was NOT the recipe. And we used to snicker about it as if \"they only knew\". I make this every Thanksgiving and is a huge hit of course.  The MSG is key (but they didn't want anyone to know) to the recipe!  It's two tablespoons(!) and the sugar measurements are 4/5 tablespoons, but you even it out with more salt if needed(to taste). The whipping cream, milk measurement...must cover the corn (equal amounts of each) to be the PERFECT consistency.  We never used parmesean cheese or cheyenne pepper, just white pepper.  Add more butter/flour mixture to make a chili like consistency, never thick, unless you like it that way. Just my opinion!",
