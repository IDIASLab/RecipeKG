All of the revisions came from other reviewer suggestions :)  I made taco seasoned ground beef, then added the tomatoes and since the meat was seasoned I added no salt and just a pinch of sugar.  I changed the layers, as suggested, and put the noodles on the bottom,hamburger next, cream mixture next (an ounce more cream cheese, 1/2 c more sour cream), then cheddar cheese.  I covered with foil for first half the cooking time and removed it for the second half.  It was truly DELICIOUS once it was made with the CHANGES.  I have a picky husband & 4 year old and they both gobbled it up and had seconds!  It was just as good rewarmed the next day!",

I use 3 green onions instead of regular and mix it with 2 cups sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese in a separate bowl.  I also use 16 oz of tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and mix with ground beef, a can of corn, 1 tsp sugar and salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  I then layer   (repeatedly and in this order) the cooked noodles, beef mixture, and the cream cheese mixture.  I then top with a lot of cheddar cheese and bake until it bubbles (about 30 minutes).",

I mixed the onions in with the meat and added some taco seasoning and salsa.  I did use 8 oz of cream cheese and sour cream and 16 oz of noodles so I had to make a 9x9 pan too, but my husband pulled that out of the freezer for lunch 2 days later.  \nI did almost the same thing the second time but I made it Italian.  I used Spaghetti sauce and topped with Mozzeralla cheese.  The noodles on the top of this one were crunchy so next time I'll layer them on the bottom only.\nMy family and I loved this recipe and  I look forward to playing with it more.\n                                                                                  /(6/17 addition)        \nOkay This recipe has been a staple in our house for 2 years now.  I have enjoyed it so much that I don't have to look at the recipe anymore, not that I follow the recipe exactly either.  I mixed black beans in with the meat the last time I made this because I didn't have enough meat and it was probably the best yet.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

Firstly I use 2 lbs. of meat 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef and 1/2 lb. locally homemade hot sausage. I saute the onions with the meat mixture instead of adding it to the cream cheese mixture and use double the amount of diced tomatoes. I also use a whole 16 oz. container of sour cream and the whole 8 oz. container of cream cheese. I also use about 1/2 cup more of the cheddar on top. The best and most flavorful change I made however was adding a package of dried onion soup mix to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture. I did this the very first time I made it and it turned out great. I tried it once without it because I didn't have any on hand and the dish just wasn't the same. In all a great recipe. The hubby's buddies now flock to my house when they find out I'm making it so I have to make 2 batches every time. Thanks for the great recipe!",
