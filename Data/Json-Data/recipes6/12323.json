Because some reviewers complained about their cookies coming out flat, I used heaping teaspoons of the baking soda and baking powder.

Like others stated, even if the cookies don't appear to be done, take them out anyway and let them set up. Thanks for a terrific recipe!",

I sustituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the shortening and reduced the white and brown sugars to 2/3 cup each.  Also  increased the amts for baking soda and baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp each.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and approx 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp cream of tarter.  Also my \"cups\" for the oats and coconut were heaping. The dough was quite wet so I chilled it for about an hour.  Once chilled I rolled it into balls (heaping TBSP size) and baked for 9-10 minutes until just turning golden.  Let cool for a few minutes on pan and then removed.  These cookies turned out chewy and perfect!  They turned out the perfect shape and I had no problems with then being too flat!  These are a new family favorite and will definately make again!!  Next time I might add raisins or butterscotch chips, which would be very yummy as well!!",

I halved the recipe and made four minor changes:\n\n* I used only butter (no shortening on hand).\n\n* I added a little extra oatmeal as previous reviewers suggested.\n\n* I mixed all the ingredients together in my Kitchenaid (I didn't separate wet and dry).\n\n* I shortened the cooking time until the cookies appeared baked on the sides and still moist in the middle.\n\nThe end result was wonderful. The buttery coconut taste was warm and exotic. The coconut and oatmeal added a nice texture. The cookies were a little flatter than most recipes I have made, but undercooking them allowed them to remain moist. I will definitely make this recipe again.",

I followed the recipe except that I added cinnamon per others' suggestions and added semi-sweet chocolate chips to half the dough. I was a little disappointed but this recipe still has merit in that the buttery coconut flavor went very nicely with the oatmeal. Next time I will reduce the sugar add nuts (personal preference) and use all butter. I may even add some more oatmeal and coconut so that the cookie has more substance. In my opinion this is a great base for you to make alterations until it suits your taste.",
