I took it to work today and everyone went wild and requested the recipe.  I put the turkey, broth (I used turkey stock left over from T'giving), onion, a can of black beans, a can of corn, one can of chopped tomatoes, one can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis, FOUR cloves of garlic minced, the juice of one entire lime, and seasonings as written in my crock pot on low.  Eight hours later I returned from work and added about a half cup chopped fresh cilantro, two cups of shredded colby-jack cheese, and a cup of sour cream.  Stirred and let it heat on high for about thirty minutes.  Then I crushed tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl, ladled the soup over, and put more grated cheese on top.  TO DIE FOR!  Tastes like Chipotle in a bowl.  Seriously good.  Doesn't look that pretty but incredibly tasty.  I gave the recipe five stars as written to keep the ratings high so people would experiment with this FABULOUS soup!  Good luck!",

                "reviewBody": "I made a couple changes just for what I had on hand. I had four large turkey drumsticks that I bought on the cheap, so I cooked them down and pieced them out and used the broth (that I flavored up with onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika and oregano) that I made in this soup. I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes but I did have fire-roasted tomatoes, so I used that. I upped the spices quite a bit and threw in two chopped red bell pepper when I sauteed the onion and garlic. It's a great way to use turkey on the cheap, which I really appreciate and this soup as a whole is pretty low-cal, if you lighten up on your cheese sprinkling hand. Plus, it's quick, even making my own broth. After I had the broth made, it literally took me less than a half hour to pull this soup together. But, you might need more spice. I like my soups really kickin', so I just spiced away. After taste testing, I think it needs something else. I can't put my finger on it. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Doug. NOTE: And for all of you who are like me and buy turkey drumsticks for the cheap meat, four large is exactly enough for a pot of this soup!",

I used 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp of cayenne and added both black beans and corn. I thickened it with potato flakes and crushed corn chips into it.  The sour cream gave it a strange color, maybe it would work better if it had cooled down a bit.  This tastes even better the next day.",
