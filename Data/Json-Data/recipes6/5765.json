I always keep pre grilled/shredded BLSL chicken in our freezer so I used that in place of the raw chicken. I also added a T of butter just because I love the richness a bit of butter adds to soup. I always use chicken stock so I did here as well. We only had 1% milk but I'd have used skim if we had it. The only \"white\" beans we had were blackeyed peas so that's what I used though I'm sure that's not what I was supposed to use (they worked though!). I added well more than a 1/2 tsp salt probably closer to 1-2 tsp but I like \"salty\" soup. This was an excellent soup that came together in a short amount of time just as the title suggests. I'd absolutely make this again. The red pepper (and I used some I'd previously frozen w/no noticeable impact) and corn (white frozen) added a nice bit of sweetness to the soup. THANKS for the recipe!",

The flavor was there, it just needed more \"stuff\" in it for my family.  Next time I will definitely add the whole can of beans rather than just 1 cup.  I will also add about 1/2 again as much chicken.  Will definitely make this again.",

I seasoned the chicken breast with the olive oil S&P and garlic powder then baked it in a 350 degree oven for 35 minutes. I diced it and tossed it with all the other ingredients in the slow cooker on low until the onion and pepper were soft. Only had a yellow pepper which added a nice sweetness. Served with garlic bread this was a nice hearty meal.",

I only rate 4 stars because I made some changes:\n\n1) Omitted onion, red pepper, and cheddar cheese (though I did sprinkle some Parmesan in mine - partner won't eat cheese!!)\n\n2) Reduced chicken broth to 3 cups. Used way more than 1 clove of minced garlic, plus 1-2 teaspoons of garlic powder. The white beans were slow-cooked leftovers. I added 1T of butter and 3 strips of crumbled bacon! I used 2% milk instead of skim, and chose to include the salt and pepper while the chicken was browning.\n\nI will DEFINITELY be making this again, perhaps with peas and carrots.
