According to the blog All in Good Food he decreases the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cup *this effects the sugar concentration* and brings to 230 degrees F under med-high heat. Just like fudge, if it's raining or humid, you will need to boil a bit longer (but not above max soft ball stage) so the cookie will suck moisture out of the air. Have all your ingredients pre-measured b/c this moves fast after removing from heat.",

When I compared the two recipes, I found that they had the same ingredients; however, the ratios and the cooking processes were different. The oatmeal has to be added before the peanut butter because the peanut butter cools the mixture down. If you don't, your oatmeal stays firm. The desired texture for these cookies is a slighty softened oatmeal. I would look for another recipe if you prefer a more original style no-bake  cookie. I hope this helps.",
