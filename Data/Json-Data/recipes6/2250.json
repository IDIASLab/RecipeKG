If you can't find 100 proof then regular 80 proof (40%) will do. Don't skimp on the cheap stuff use a decent brand. It makes a difference in the taste of your end result. Easy, cheaper than store-bought and everyone that loves Kahlua will love this and be asking for more. Cheers!",

One week later, I decided to try them again, before I made some huge batches for gifts and this recipe was WAY better!  WAYYYY better!  This is full, well-rounded flavor.  The coffee and vanilla come through clearly and the brown sugar melds it all together (the other recipe was all white sugar).  Off to the store for bags of brown sugar cuz Santa Clause (errrr, the Grinch!) is coming to town!",
