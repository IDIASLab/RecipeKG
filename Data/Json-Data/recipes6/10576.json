I didn't want to wait to add the raisins, (not a currant in the house)so they went in with everything else, didn't seem to hurt anything except to maybe make the buns a darker color, if you want whole raisins don't do this. A quick tip to make the frosting,  put your powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla in a heavy plastic sandwich bag, mix by kneading the bag gently when all the ingredients are mixed well cut a tiny hole in one corner of the bag and squeeze to make the crosses.",

So good with a cup of tea.....",

Also, I didn't use a breadmaker(just kneeded for 5-10 minutes)  Maybe they would end up fluffier if I used a breadmaker.  I put a sweetdough cross on it as well instead of icing and found this to more like the store bought ones.  I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup icing sugar, vanilla and 2 tsp or so milk to make it the desired consistancy.  The second time I made them I tried putting the sweetdough in an empty milkbag with a small hole cut in the corner and piped the crosses on the buns.  They definately taste better with cloves and allspice(1/2 tsp each) added.  I also used raisons and found them fine.",

Fancier models of bread machines that have a dough cycle that includes a rising time can omit the rising in the pan described in the original recipe. I also would go ahead and add the currants/raisins and cinnamon with the rest of the ingredients, rather than waiting.   The taste is much like very light white bread with a hint of cinnamon and raisins.  If you prefer more zip, add the allspice, vanilla, butter extract etc as recommended by a previous reviewer.  However, the recipe as it stands is really very good.  The buns come out huge and golden - picture perfect.",
