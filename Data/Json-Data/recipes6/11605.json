I reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons and the sugar to 1/4 cup. Baked in an 8.5 by 11 inch casserole it took far longer than 45 minutes maybe 1.25 hours. Turned out as a creamy custard over a corn base and was plenty sweet enough for my husband and me. The corn was a little watery on the bottom but fine. Will make for company and holidays.",
