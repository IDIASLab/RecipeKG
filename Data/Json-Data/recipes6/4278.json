Cooking for one I only needed three enormous fresh scallops! After they were cooked I squeezed the juice of a lime over it. Since the dish was accompanied by very fresh young samphire I needed no salt.\nI'm now replete and delighted! Thank you for the recipe. I'm going to try it again again really soon!",
