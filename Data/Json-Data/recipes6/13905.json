This gave it a bright green color and nicer texture.\r\nFor those people who are concerned about fat grams, follow these simple steps: substitute some water for the oil in the dressing, use 1 TBS of butter for sauteeing, and used baked ramen noodles instead.Another option would be simply sprinkle them on top without frying them at all. Thank you for the recipe!!!",

However when I later checked the nutritional information I was appalled to see that this salad has almost 600 calories and 50 grams of fat PER SERVING!!!! That's terrible! As much as I loved this salad I probably won't make it again because of the terrible nutritional value. So sorry that's for sure!",
