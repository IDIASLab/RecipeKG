I followed the recipe exactly except it took more like 30 to 35 minutes in the oven. Oh and instead of drizzling the peanut butter topping I spread it over the hardened chocolate so that every bite gets both the peanut butter and chocolate. Really yummy! My two-year old enjoyed them a lot! Thanks Mandy for a simple and tasty recipe.:)",
