I might try swapping vanilla for lemon or almond extract the next time and play around with this great little recipe. My only problem was that the seeds tended to settle on the bottom of the dish so when dipping the bread it was mostly seedless. It would work out better to sprinkle them on after dipping I would think or else stir them up every dip. Thanks Jessica I love poppy seed muffins and this gave me the flavor without the wait.",
