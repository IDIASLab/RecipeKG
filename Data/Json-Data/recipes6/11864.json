This recipe is just like the Fortune Cookies you get in a Chinese restaurant.  The thing I like most about this recipe in comparison to my other recipe, is that my other one calls for butter and yes, it does enhance the taste and yes, I will continue to use this recipe when I mold the cookies into other shapes (logs, bowls...) because the butter makes such a tasty cookie, BUT I have now, officially adopted THIS recipe when I want to put in the fortunes, because these don't put the grease spots on my paper fortune like the recipe with butter.  And no matter how I tried, I could never get around those butter/grease marks.  The key to this recipe is to make sure you make each circle VERY thin before baking to prevent a soft pancake-like center.  Follow the rest of the directions closely and you will have successful fortune cookies for your special event!",

I also added 2 Tbsp of butter to the mix and 1/8 tsp almond extract. I sprayed the sheet between each use. Make the cookies on the backside of the pan, it's easier to get them off quickly. I folded them in half on a cutting board, bent them on the rim of a mug and then let them cool in the muffin pan as suggested. Be careful if you are going to try to crisp the cookies by reheating them (250 degrees, 10 minutes). When they warm up again, they begin to unfold. Perhaps leaving the cookies in the muffin pan would help keep their shape.",

I added both vanilla and almond extact and reduced the sugar to 2 T a batch. I made over 100 of these for a wedding. We had best results by making no more than 4 at a time and cooling in a muffin tin. Also the cookies were just not crunchy enough for my liking. So after they were formed I stuck them in a 250 degree oven for about 10 minutes to get them drier.",

I'm so glad I didn't give up.  \r\n\r\nI followed it as written and am very pleased with the result.\r\n\r\nAt one point I was struggling to remove the cookies from the sheets so I tried one reviewer's idea about using parchment.  I had to remove the cookies from the parchment and bake one more minute directly on the pan but this worked fine.  \r\n\r\nI found it easier though just to omit the parchment and be sure to butter the sheet generously, spread batter evenly so edges were not too thin, and not to let them brown too much.  As long as you slide them off the sheet immediately you have plenty of time to do the rest.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to do two batches.  Just as you get the hang of it with the first batch you'll be hooked and will want to keep the fun going!\r\n\r\nI'm thrilled to have found this because my parents invited us out for a Chinese dinner tomorrow and with some help from the restaurant we plan to use these to announce that our first child is on the way.  (Yes, these are good enough to serve as \"the real thing\".)\r\n\r\nI hope my comments help.\r\n\r\nThank you Aleta!",

I wanted to do a test run of these cookies prior to Valentine's Day next week-I thought it would be fun to make these for my sons' classes with little V-Day messages inside of the cookies. I also added the butter to the batter-make sure it is melted-the first batch I used only softened butter and the batter was entirely too thick-the cookies ended up extremely \"cakey\". Also grease the heck out of those cookie sheets! These cookies cool so quickly when they are removed from the oven-you must move quickly-even after making about 12 of these I could still only do 2 in the oven at a time-so this is definitely a lenghty process-but as in anything homemade-worth it. I am definitely going to keep at attempting to master this-how cool to make your own fortune cookies. Confucius say: Try this recipe.:)",
