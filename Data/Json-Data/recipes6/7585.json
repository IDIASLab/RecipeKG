I found this recipe and did a test run over the weekend for some dinner guests and the results were awesome!  The consistency of the filling was light with just the right amount of pumpkin pie spice to compliment the pumpkin flavor.    I thought I would try filling them the night before and admittedly the shells were slightly soft, but still good.  If you have the time, I would recommend filling them the same day as you'll be serving them, otherwise the night before still produces a delicious dessert.",
