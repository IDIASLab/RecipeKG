What I did differently: - omitted the crushed red pepper flakes - used chicken broth instead of vegetable - used 4 smallish cucumbers - added 3 small potatoes What I plan to do differently next time: - half the cayenne pepper (at least) - puree half of the soup to a chunky consistency and puree the other half to a creamier consistency I didn't believe the reviewers who said it was too spicy. We love spicy food so the only thing I omitted was the crushed red pepper because we didn't have any on hand. It wasn't spicy enough to stop me from eating two bowls of it -- but I do think that next time I will at least halve the cayenne pepper. If it's still too spicy after that I may cut back on the curry. I think the curry is part of what makes this so tasty though so that's the last thing I'll consider cutting back. My husband didn't like the creamy consistency so I'm going to try leaving half of the soup a little chunkier for him next time. My husband is not a soup lover and we were both a little wary of cucumber soup -- but he really seemed to enjoy this soup so it's definitely going to be a keeper for our family!",
