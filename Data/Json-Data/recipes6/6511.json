I didn't have a \"stew\" button on my pressure cooker so I started out cooking it high pressure for 10 minutes and then I put it on low pressure for 30. I didn't know if it was going to work but it did so make note if you do not have a stew button. I also expected to put beef stock into it and it wasn't listed on the ingredients. I poured about 2 cups.  The meat was tender and the stew had a flavor of bourbon, but not over strong. It's what gave it a unique taste. Oh, I also poured corn starch onto my meat before cooking. Browned it well and gave a bit of starch as a thickener. I will make again for sure.",
