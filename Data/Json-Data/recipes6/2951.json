It wasn't mentioned what size of pan to use so I used a 8 X 12 class dish, which was fine but I should have stuck with the original amount of ingredients for the topping.  Other than that, it was just what I was looking for in taste.  I would definitely make this again.",

The peel helped remind us this dessert contained apples! The brown sugar can be cut way down here. I would change this recipe and add no more than two tablespoons to the apples, and no more than 3/4 cup to the topping\u2026I would also reduce the rest of the topping  ingredients across the board by half. The apple to topping ratio is way off. I think with these changes this recipe has potential. (I would also suggest peeling the apples if it\u2019s your preference)",
