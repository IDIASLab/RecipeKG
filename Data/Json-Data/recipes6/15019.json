The feedback I got from dog owners was STUPENDOUS!  DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS!!!  One lady told me she was given a few of these by a co-worker and took them home in her purse.  When she got home, her dog literally dragged her purse across the floor trying to get to them.  I substitute Jiffy cornbread mix for the cornmeal (& eliminate the sugar).  I also have used chicken bouillon.  To cut down on work for me, I always buy the large bags of sharp shredded cheese (Kraft). This is a little more cheese than the recipe calls for, but works great.  This makes a large batch, so just divide appropriately and freeze the rest for later.  Bow Wow!",

I omit it, and add some extra oats and whole wheat flour instead. Also, instead of white sugar I prefer to use honey. Other than that it's a great recipe, just play around with it. Most importantly: If you don't have the time to roll out the dough and use cookie cutters, shape it into 2 logs, roll 'em up in waxpaper, and put 'em in the freezer for a couple of hours. Cut the log into 1/2 inch slices, place the slices on a cookie sheet, and bake them as directed. Saves a lot of time, and it's a 'no mess, no fuss' solution. Just a thought...Thanks for reading.",

I subbed the cornmeal as corn is not good for most dogs and put nutritional yeast in it's place as it tastes cheesy but is loaded with B vitamins to repel mosquitoes and fleas, I subbed the cheddar for Mozzarella (lower in fat), I added a second egg to make them softer, eliminated the sugar, subbed margarine for olive oil (no trans fats) and lowered the cheese as I was using the yeast so it only needed 3/4 cup cheese.  I tested these on all the dogs today at our fund raiser for 4-H dog project and got 100% approval - over 20 dogs (even very \"finiky\" ones that are \"not food motivated\") loved these treats!  With the changes, they are LOADED with healthy fats and nutrients.  I also used Omega 3 eggs (as I feed my chickens flax so they pass on the good fats in the eggs).  Even with all the subs - it was an excellent recipe.  Next time I'll try it with rice flour for gluten intolerant dogs.  Thanks for this one - I'll bake it for our fundraisers.",
