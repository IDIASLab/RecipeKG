We substituted shredded parmesan for the mozzarella & added basil oregano & garlic. Try broccoli italian peppers or carmelized onions for a change of veggie flavor. MOST IMPORTANTLY...BAKE LONGER....at least 5 - 10 minutes to lightly brown. That will eliminate some runniness...also just let it set for 5 - 10 minutes before you cut. It will come out great.",
