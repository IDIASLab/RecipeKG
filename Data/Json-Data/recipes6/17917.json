For everyone considering making this recipe:  be very careful when heating the milk mixture.  We had to do it twice as we killed the yeast the first time.  In the end we wound up throwing the ingredients in a bowl and putting them in the microwave for 30 seconds rather than heating them on the stove.  This worked perfectly and when we added the yeast it foamed just like the recipe says.",

                "reviewBody": "One of the best bread recipes. Very simple recipe ,not overly crowded with directions. I used it to make loaves of cinnamon bread. It was perfect! It's also very easy to tinker up a bit.I did find the rise times a bit short so I opted for double in size except for the final. There, I ovened the loaves when they had risen and looked like loaves.For those who had failures to rise, remember that yeast is a very sensitive live culture. Too hot and you kill it. Too cold and it doesn't wake up. Salted butter works just fine although excess salt will slow the culture as will too much sugar. Just cut down on the recipe salt. If you start with warm liquid at about body temperature and it is slow to activate, just give it a bit more time. It will come around if your yeast isn't dead. Yeast culture needs to be foamy to make your dough rise.Don't give up on it.Another note, the final dough should be on the stiff side to give body to the final product. One thing to remember, you are making bread..and to be blunt,you need to work hell out of the dough. Keep kneading until you get tired--and then knead some more. when the dough is ready it should stretch much like melted cheese. This really is a great recipe and well worth the effort.",

Second time, (I omitted the butter from the yeast process), the milk was too cool so I set the bowl of milk, yeast & sugar into a larger bowl of hot tap water and viola!  It started foaming within minutes!  I took it out of the warm bath and let it activate for 10 mins and mixed the dough according to the recipe and added the softened butter with the eggs.  I brushed with melted butter before and after baking.  I mixed up cinnamon honey butter for spreading on them and my friends raved!  I'm making these on Thanksgiving, for sure!
