I needed cookie shapes for one of my kindergartens and decided to try a new recipe but have been disappointed. If you follow the recipe as-is this can only be spooned even if you chill it. I made several modifications while doing another batch which made a nice light sugar cookie. Add half a cup of confectioners' sugar to the butter mixture because by the end (as I had expected) you'll need more floury so if you don't want it to be bland you need it a bit sweeter. Follow the rest as written except add milk gradually and only as much as needed until you have a fair consistency for a dough -- it will not be a full cup maybe 2/3. Chill it then it can be rolled into 1 tsp balls (if you use a melon baller with a scoop so that it does not stick you can make them more uniform) roll in granulated white sugar and press down slightly onto baking sheet (with baking parchment paper works best). Space them because they will puff out. Bake until it's a cookie (right before it would start to brown if you can estimate well). Well that turned out alright but since the recipe as it was given was not at all what it promises I can only give this two stars.",

I almost didn't make the cookies b/c of some of them. I'm glad that I did however. This cookie recipe is the best I have ever found!! I will use it for the rest of my cookie making days and will also pass it on to friends and family. I have not gotten one bad comment about this cookie as a matter of fact just the opposite. Everyone who has eaten one of these cookies wants the recipe. I did make a couple of small modifications such as using less milk than the recipe calls for (about 2/3 of a cup) and I also used almond extract for flavor. I then used a round biscuit cutter to cut the cookies with and they baked up beautifully!! I frosted them with my peppermint flavored icing (white and red) and made \"peppermint candy cookies\" out of them. They were a big hit at my companies' Christmas party!! I did not have any problems with rolling the cookies out and they did not need to be chilled. Just flour the area to roll them out in and your rolling pin. I realize this is just my opinion but I felt I needed to make sure nobody would pass this recipe by without giving it a chance b/c it is a great one! Thanks!",
