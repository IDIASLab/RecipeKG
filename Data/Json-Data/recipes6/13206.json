I used more cheddar cheese on both the bottom and the top, I used a large can of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and I put a layer of sliced olives on top of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  The result was so yummy!  I do admit though that leftovers are even BETTER so I think next time I will cook it the day before I want to serve it, then put it in the fridge and reheat it the following day. Pure comfort food that you and your family will love.",

I put a little oregano on top of the tomato sauce and meat mixture for just a little extra flavor.

Very good recipe will definately make again!",
