They are golden in color and resemble small rice pieces. Steel-cut oats are also known as coarse-cut oats, pinhead oats, or Irish oats. I usually buy them in bulk at my local farmer's market co-op store. This recipe is delish. I love the addition of the apple and the use of the crock pot. It makes the whole house smell wonderful, and there is very little effort or time required from me. My two year old would eat this for every meal of the day if I gave him the option (which is tempting on some days).",

Try maple with the vanilla extract.\n\nThanks for posting the recipe.",

Those who complain about it being complete mush are likely using the quaker oaks, or rolled oats.  Steel cut oats look like tiny pieces of uncooked rice, not the flat round oats.  This is a great recipe for early mornings for the whole family.  Thanks!",

When I got up, this was cooked perfectly.  It did need some salt; since the recipe didn't call for it, I didn't put any in at the beginning.  My husband added more brown sugar and raisins to his, but I ate mine just the way it came out (except for adding salt).  Very good recipe.  Perfect for work nights.  Thanks, brandysue!",

I thought 3 1/2 cups of water to 1 cup of oatmeal seemed like a really wrong ratio. I normally cook oatmeal on the stove top in about 5 minutes. The oats have a nice bite to them still. I decided to try this method after seeing many recipes. I thought the oatmeal was mushy and it was surrounded with a thick gummy liquid. I also didn't care for the darker brown color. I am one to normally cut sugar in a recipe, but this one needed at least twice the brown sugar listed to give it some flavor. The crock pot was also a pain to clean. No one would eat it and it ended up getting tossed. It was so thick, brown, and mushy, I didn't know how to salvage it.",
