This was my first time however actually make this, for some reason i though it would be really hard, but i was amazed how easy it was.  My whole family loved them, they were gone in several hours.  My only suggestion is to use the paper muffin liners.  I sprayed half my pan and used the muffin liners for the other half and the greased ones stuck pretty bad, but the paper was great.  I also used trader Joes puff pastry and just cut squares for ease... They looked a little different than the authentic ones, but the taste is excellent. I will definitely make again. Oh.. I also used a half tsp of vanilla instead of the vanilla bean.   ",

The puff pastry was a bit tricky and time-consuming to work with in the muffin cups. I think I will attempt to use another type of pastry that has a bit more of a delicate and flakier texture like of the one's I experienced in Europe. Nonetheless these custard tarts were yummy and I will make them again just gotta find that perfect pastry to compliment the custard. Obrigado!",
