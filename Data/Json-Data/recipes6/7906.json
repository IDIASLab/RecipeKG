I have experimented with as many of the ones I could find on the internet and have finally come close. I have used this on pasta tossed with sauteed veggies, and as a white sauce (bechamel sauce) in lasagna. It doesn't reheat well in the microwave, but will re-heat on the stove on low for 5 minutes. There are many variations out there but I am pretty happy with this one. You can add spices to change the flavor.",

In my rural area cashews are horrifyingly expensive so this was a splurge purchase. What a waste of expensive ingredients. I just don't like it and wouldn't waste my money again. I prefer the cauliflower based alfredo sauce. Even the strange cannellini bean alfredo sauce is better than this stuff. Not every recipe can be adapted for vegans. Alfredo sauce is one of them.
