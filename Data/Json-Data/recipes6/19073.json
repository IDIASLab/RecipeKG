The marinade didn't soak through, but the chicken was nice and tender and the outside was carmelized.  It looks great and tastes even better.  This goes very nice with pasta.  I served it with Penne from Heaven and a nice tossed salad.  ",

I change a few minor things: I skip the saffron (used it once out of curiosity and it didn't make enough of a difference to justify the price -- it's amazing without it) I cut the cayenne pepper back to just under 1/2 tsp. (to be honest I've never tried it with the full amount but it just sounds like a lot of cayenne to me -- 1/2 tsp. is great) I cut the amount of olive oil in half and I increase the marinating time. I've let this marinate anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days (once when going away on a trip when I had to take dinner along to make a couple of days later) -- delicious any way you go about it. Great for chicken sandwiches; equally great with rice pilaf or grilled potatoes.",

The only change I made was that I left out the saffron because I simply can't afford it! But one of these days I'd like to try it with it and see if it adds anything... NOTE: It's a few months later and I'm on the Atkins diet. I modified the recipe and it was just as good! I omitted the honey and used Splenda in place of the sugar.
