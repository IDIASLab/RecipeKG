Here are the other adjustments I made:\n*Used one stick of butter and 1/4 cup shortening in place of the artificially \"butter-flavored\" shortening. Seriously, I have no idea why anyone would use that stuff!\n*I froze the butter and grated it into the dry ingredients. I find this much easier and quicker than cutting in chunks of butter.\n*Substituted white whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the all purpose flour to add some extra fiber and flavor.\n*Reduced the brown sugar by about half and the spices by 1/3.\n*Plumped one cup of raisins in boiling water, drained and chilled them, then added to the dry ingredients before mixing in the buttermilk.\n*Brushed the tops with cream and sprinkled with sanding sugar before baking. \n\nThe scones turned out very flavorful, not too sweet, and had a nice crumbly (but not dry) texture.",
