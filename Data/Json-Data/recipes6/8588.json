        "description": "This dish, made with chicken, kielbasa, and potatoes, takes its inspiration from the famous fish stew of the South of France and contains all the classic seasonings, including saffron. An expensive spice, saffron is essential to this dish. The best comes from Spain. I've also added a little tarragon at the end. Although not absolutely necessary, tarragon has a slight anise taste that complements the other seasonings. To reinforce its flavor, I add a splash of Pernod&reg; or Ricard&reg; at the last minute, although this ingredient is optional too.",
