I chose to follow this recipe as a guideline rather than following it exactly. I decided to make this late in the day, so I did the quick soak method where I brought the beans and water to a boil and let them sit covered for an hour. I then poured off the water and used 2 cans of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. I omitted the ham hock because it makes food greasier than what I prefer. I did have to add more water as the beans cooked. When the beans were just tender, I added chopped onion, ham pieces, the brown sugar, and tomato sauce. I could not find a 6.5 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I used all of the 8 oz. can I bought. I cooked it all for another hour as the recipe states. I ate this for dinner accompanied with cornbread and green onions.",
