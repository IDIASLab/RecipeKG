Not sure, but I might find that completely eliminating the water might work best for me (personal taste preference).  The quantities of olive oil and balsamic are balanced well, and I enjoyed this today on a lunch salad.  I do think the recipe author is correct; you have options with this dressing.  ----UPDATE 10.4.14------I'd recommend you refrigerate this dressing before using because it tasted tons better the next day, definitely more flavor!",

I'm always on the lookout for homemade dressings because store bought ones are just full of preservatives - plus they don't taste that great.  This one seemed like it had a lot of flavorful ingredients so I tried it and it is by FAR my favorite homemade dressing!  I modified it just a bit though - to reduce the fat, I cut the EVOO in half and used Hellman's low fat mayo instead of full fat mayo.  Made quite a difference in the overall calories and fat content and  the taste is still awesome!!  I also used white balsamic vinegar instead of traditional just because I think the color turns out much prettier (doesn't turn the dressing a strange off-brown like traditional balsamic vinegar does).  Some reviews recommend cutting out the water, but I left it in to thin out the dressing since I cut the EVOO in half.  Overall, a really stellar dressing - we use it for all kinds of salads and everyone raves about the \"restaurant quality\" dressing!  Thanks for posting it!!",
