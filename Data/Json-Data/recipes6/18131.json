It is so refreshing on warm summer days and anyone who has had it loves it! I shave off frozen mixture with a spoon and serve in a glass with just enough Sprite so that it is still slushy frozen. Mix and break up slush with spoon so Sprite is evenly distributed. Should be on the thick side. Gin keeps it from getting so frozen that you can't get it out so don't leave it out. And yes you can feel pretty darn good on these! Awesome! Thanks Johanne!",
