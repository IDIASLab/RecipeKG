This is my current favorite version for empty nesters (i.e. two servings). The gravy is optional but very tasty. It is important to use the size pan indicated so that wine sauce can spread out and evolve. I find the gravy is better if not too thick. Also use milk if you want a thinner gravy.",

Probably should have used a bigger pan to bake them in but the biggest I had was a 20\". I did have to cook them a little longer. I only used about 1/2 of the leftover flour in the sauce but it was plenty thick. I also mixed the flour with the cream first and then added the liquid to keep my gravy from lumping. The boys even used the gravy on their salad they thought it was so good.Goes really well with rice pilaf.",

With the exception of using boneless pork loin chops I made this exactly per the recipe and I wouldn't change a single thing. At first taste of the gravy I thought it had a funky sweet taste which concerned me but serving it with the chops and some mashed potatoes all the flavors and the heat melded together and we were hooked. I do have to agree with the other reviewers who said there is way too much flour mixture than was needed but I added extra parts of flour and water to make extra gravy. Will definitely make this again when my kids come to visit or for company.",
