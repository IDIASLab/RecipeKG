I used melted butter instead of oil instant coffee instead of brewed and baked it in 3 9\"cake pans instead of two. I wasn't sure about covering the cake while it cooled but I did it and it turned out perfectly. Taste texture were amazing. Another change I made was to the frosting. I added 8oz cream cheese to the peanut butter layer. That was good! My battery was dead by the time I made the frosting so I made the recipe off the cocoa can but it wasn't quite enough so I melted butter and chocolate chips together for the top of the cake. Awesome!",

The flavor was excellent and the texture was just what you want from a cake. I would suggest maybe making this a 3 layer cake as my pans did overflow some but other than that change nothing. For the filling and frosting I used the peanut butter frosting also listed on this site and then crushed some peanut butter oreo's and used them as filling (along with the PB frosting) and garnished the top of the cake with them also. All I can say was it was DEVINE. The pinnacle of chocolate and peanut butter cakes.",
