In order to speed up cooking, I put everything other than the sour cream and flour in the skillet from the beginning with the potatoes and carrots sliced thin.  I also used dried minced onion and garlic powder.  I brought it to a boil and simmered it all for about 20 minutes until the potatoes and carrots were tender and the meat thermometer read 170+.  Then I added the sour cream and flour.  As I noticed all that delicious creamy sauce, I quickly decided to cook some egg noodles to serve this over.  Yum!  My 6-year-old son proclaimed it his favorite food.  What a shocker!",

I used chicken bouillon instead of beef. I mixed in the sauerkraut (which I squeezed the liquid out of) instead of layeriing it. Will double next time for leftovers. YUM!!!!!!",

The only thing i would add might be some chopped parsley scattered over it as garnish. THANK YOU!",

Just a few minor changes for us though.....used turkey kielbasa, olive oil instead of butter, totally elimanated the potatoes(and made pierogies on the side), and used only 1/2c. sour cream(low fat)......very tasty and a nice easy one pot meal. Will make again.  Loved the caraway seed.....adds a lot of flavor....great with the kraut. Thanks!",
