I also used 6 tbsp of butter and 1/4 cup of extra light olive oil in place of the the 2/3 cup butter to lower the saturated fat content of the cake.  Finally, I used the previous reviewers recipe for a rum glaze but it made way too much, you probably only need 2 tbsp melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup rum (after removing from heat). It was very good moist and addictive!",
