This recipe is a great base to enjoy as-is or play with to suit your creative tastes. This dish packs a flavor punch, so use milder side dishes like a rice pilaf and your favorite green beans to cool down the taste buds between bites and avoid sensation overload. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it does taste expensive! Have fun with it and share your variations in the reviews section to help inspire others.",
