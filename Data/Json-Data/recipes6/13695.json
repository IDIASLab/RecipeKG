Here is what I did.  First, I cut the recipe in half as there were only 3 of us eating it (and one of them was a 2 year old).  I sauteed the onions in the butter and while they were cooking, I put the cubed squash in the microwave for 3 minutes to par-cook it.  Then I added the squash to the pan with the onion, added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar, salt, cayenne pepper and some craisins.  Cooked that for a few minutes covered then added the toasted pecans and served.  The end result was really, really good and we will make this again for sure.",

The changes I always make are: 1)microwave the cubed squash for about 5 minutes before it goes into the pan...makes it cook much faster, and more evenly; 2)add craisins...makes it pretty and delicious; 3)sprinkle on a little cinnamon and a tiny bit of cayenne.

THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH LOSING A FINGER. Maybe even two.  This was absolutely delicious!

Here are some simple things you can do to make this dish a success with less work: 1) Buy the pre-cut butternut squash--your pieces will be the same size and will be more likely to cook evenly. 2) You can't always substitute dried parsley for fresh and you shouldn't in this dish. It won't be as good so don't blame the recipe and rate it lower if you do this and don't care for it. Use FRESH! 3) Microwaving the squash first to par cook it as another reviewer mentioned is an excellent idea. But if you don't no worries. Stir frequently and keep covered...lower your temperature if it starts to stick or cook too quickly. Lower and slower works well for me. It's ok if some of the pieces cook more than others it gives it a creaminess that my guests enjoy. 4) If you use a nonstick skillet you can reduce the amount of butter it's a very buttery dish.",

My changes on the basic recipe: olive oil for butter -- as most people on those potlucks were vegan; I also followed a reviewer's advice and baked it for 30 minutes (makes it easier to peel and cut in cubes). It's worth paying close attention to the baking point and not using too much water on the bottom of the baking sheet (or none at all) as that could render too much water on the cooking pan later. I also made more than recipe calls. For a 22-serving dish the customized recipe calls for 6 1/4 lb squash. I instead used 11 lb also put more pecans and voila. What a success.",
