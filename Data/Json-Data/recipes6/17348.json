This took about an hour to bake, give or take, and it came out moist and fluffy. I didn't have any with the family, but judging by their faces and lack of conversation at the table, they enjoyed this. I DID NOT make a glaze for this. This one's a keeper.",

Grandmas had the best recipes and they knew what the best was supposed to be because they all seemed to know what they were doing.  Sure enough, Gramma Bertha's cake did not disappoint me, although I took a little liberty with her recipe by adding 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.  When I cut into the cake I got concerned when I saw what looked like uncooked batter.  But not to worry!  I had never added sliced bananas to a batter rather than mashing them and what I was seeing (whew!) was the sliced bananas!  I have no criticism of this recipe whatsoever (although I'm glad for my small additions).  First, I love the texture of it - it's not as dense, as \"wet\" if you will, as banana breads (cakes) can sometimes be.  It does have a well-developed crumb, so in my view this really is a banana CAKE, not banana bread masquerading as one.  It's moist and just sweet enough \u2013 remember,  the closer to mushy black your bananas are, the sweeter they'll be and so will the cake.  Mine were brown-speckled.  Because I baked it in a specialty Bundt pan with a lot of detail I didn't frost or glaze it, just sprinkled it with powdered sugar and I'm kind of glad for it - the cake stands on its own with no other frosting or glaze necessary, although a chocolate butter cream or cream cheese frosting would be nice, as would a vanilla or caramel glaze.  Gramma Bertha's cake, I'm sure, has pleased a lot of family and friends.",

This recipe is so easy to put together and doesn't require a lot of ingredients - nothing fancy, just plain good!  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and like most others I smashed my bananas vs. slicing.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon along with a 1/2 tsp. of salt.  And to take an already delicious cake over the top I added a whole bag of mini-chocolate chips!  It was done in exactly one hour and turned out moist, tender and delicious!  No icing needed, just a dusting of confectioners' sugar over top once it cooled.  Thanks for sharing your Gramma's recipe LISAPAV!",

I'm always faced with bananas that are not eaten because they turn brown too quickly (nice & sweet just not as pretty on the outside) so when I see a recipe that calls for more than one banana I check it out... This one was a winner! Eleven people had some of mine (baked in a rectangular pan) and each person really liked it. I was the only one who thought it was a bit too sweet (I'll reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup next time anyway). I live at an elavation of 6800 ft so I used less leavening (baking powder instead of baking soda). Turned out great! Getting 11 people to all like the same thing is not an easy task so I'm quite impressed. This recipe is a keeper thanks.",
