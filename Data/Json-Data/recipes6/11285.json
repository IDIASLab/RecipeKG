It was time consuming and a little tricky to get to the right consistancy due to my substituting half and half instead of the heavy cream. If you do that allow for extra boil time to reduce the moisture level. This frosting has the texture of a thick glaze so bear this in mind when spreading it. It's not going to look like butter cream on your cake. It will however be the most delicious stuff you've ever put on a cake!",
