I agree with other reviewers that ground pork is the more traditional ingredient but I've used sliced beef in this and the flavours complement very well. This is really saucy so serve it with lots of fluffy rice. Putting this over Pad Thai also gives a nice change. Vegetarians could omit the meat and use cubed crumbled or fried tofu instead. It's actually one of my favourite ways to eat tofu. Thanks Minhuey for giving me a taste of mom's home cooking!",

'Would've used 2t oyster sauce, but I was out.  'Rest of the measurements as written.  I used the white half of the green onions in the first part so they got cooked & the green half at the end.  Only problem, which really wasn't, was there wasn't any sauce to thicken.  I used the full smount of sauce for one pound of eggplant.  The chili sauce, the Chinese type - not the ketchup cousin, added just a little spice.  I'd say kidfriendly spice amount.  For adults, I'd add more - & will.  :)  OH, OH, OH, I kinda did change a few more things now that I'm rereading the recipe.  Oops.  I didn't have any ginger root (didn't add powdered either) & didn't add any shrimp or meat.  I did add a little tofu - maybe a third of a package, about a cup & half or so.  It, along with the green onions, helped with the appearance.  'Think the (sesame) oil amount should be 1t.  Huh, maybe not.  With the addition of meat, you may want that much.  Anyway, it was good & I think you should try it.  It's not the prettiest dish you'll see, but it is very good.  'Kinda cute that the eggplant seeds look like sesame seeds on the finished product. Note4Me:  If you add enough sauce ingredietnts, no need to cover for cooking.  Two large eggplants, one zucch, one squash, three mush, half can o water chestnuts needed an 8qt(?) stock/soup pot.9/12recip",
