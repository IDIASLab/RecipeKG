Love all the ingredients separately but dear god this is bland despite an entire head of garlic. Easy to make but completely tasteless. Whatever it needs to make it palatable it's not included on the ingredient list.",

I froze half of what i made and when i unfreeze it i added celery salt and parsley.",
