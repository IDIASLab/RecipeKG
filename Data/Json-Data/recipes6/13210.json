I should have known from the three bouillion and beef broth but I never made spaghetti sauce before so now I know. I love the simplicity of this recipe but I would leave out the bouillion and the beef broth because I prefer spaghetti sauce with a strong/fresh tomato taste. I love that it's a thick sauce so I think it's a good recipe just not enough tomato flavor for me. I left out the pepperoni when I made this and also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

It wasn't as tomato-ey as I hoped so I didn't find it to be an outstanding sauce for spaghetti but I froze leftovers and it made an awesome lasagna (my family raved). I am happy with most of the ingredients but here are some alterations for my tastes. I will only use 1 bay leaf and 1 beef bouillon cube next time as well as use 3 cans of tomato sauce 1 can of puree use red wine in place of beef broth. I doubled the herbs and garlic because I like a lot of flavor. After reading another review I may also try adding some soy sauce.",
