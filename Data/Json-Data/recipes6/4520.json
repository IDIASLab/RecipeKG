A friend brought me some beautiful fennel from the organic veggie co-op she uses. I just made this soup tonight. I did it just as the author said, then halved the finished product. I left half just as it was, and to the other half I added some diced onion, milk, some of the fennel leaves and extra fresh ground pepper. I pureed my version in the blender. Both are fantastic and totally different. I love the author's version for an autumn dish served hot and would go beautifully with lamb, and I think mine would be very nice as a cold soup for summer, with chicken or fish. It's chilling right now. I'm pleased to find such a simple and versatile recipe for such an interesting and underrated vegetable. I intend to make it again and again, trying different things here and there. Awesome recipe!",
