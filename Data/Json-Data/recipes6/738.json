I used the smallest bake dish the ham would fit into so I wouldn't have to dilute the flavors with lots of additional water needed to cover the ham, but the flavors (although good) were still muted.  As the ham baked, it curled up above the cooking liquid.  I flipped it over while cooking, but it still turned out dry.  Perhaps covering the bake dish with foil would prevent the ham from drying out, or double the initial brown sugar/Worcestershire/clove mix.",

No dry, curly meat...turned out perfect! It was such easy prep, it was nice to be able to concentrate on the side dishes to accompany this meal.",

The reason why it gets three stars is because the flavors were simply too muted to really taste past the ham. If I made this again I would use way less water-- just enough to cover the bottom of the pan not enough to cover the ham itself-- to see if I could bring the other ingredients to the forefront. Otherwise a very easy straightforward recipe for dinner.",

First off.....water was replaced with no sodium chicken stock (ham or veggie stock would be great also) and a splash of bourbon.  I then added a few (10) whole black peppercorns, a bay leaf, 1t. salt (on ham only), and the brown sugar I used I smoked to give it that outdoor grill taste.  I also added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  Then tossed into a 425\u00b0 oven ( i run all my ovens @425) for 25 min. or so until tasty hot.  Not to bad for a first run, now to fine tune this and see where it takes me.",
