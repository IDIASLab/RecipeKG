I've heard bison can get dry because it's so lean but the egg Worcestershire and breadcrumbs seemed to bind it together nicely and keep it from drying out. Made just as described except added some salt to the formed patties. The burgers were super flavorful. Turns out I like bison so look forward to making this again.",
