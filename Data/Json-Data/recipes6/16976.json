Her recipe calls for using a 17\" X 11\" jelly roll pan, which makes them more \"bar-like.\" I have found that cutting back on the oil helps the texture to be less heavy. I use only 1-1/4 cup, and the rest is never missed. Also have varied the type of baby food, sometimes using sweet potatoes in place of the carrots, and peaches in place of the apricots, pears in place of applesauce, or even plums. They all make only subtle differences in flavor. Virtually any fruit or root vegetable baby food can be used successfully. You can even use plums for all 3 jars and make a delicious autumn plum cake, baked in a bundt pan (usually takes around 45-55 minutes at 350 degrees) and then glaze it. The variations are quite endless. I always frost with a cream cheese frosting, which makes a good thing even better. In fact, to us, the cream cheese frosting is a must-do. Any way you make them and serve them, they never fail to draw rave reviews. Have copies of this recipe handy, because you're going to get lots of requests!",
