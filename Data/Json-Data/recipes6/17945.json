I made several modifications to this recipe. Fisrt of all like one other reviewer I found this recipe very sweet. I omitted sprinkling of powdered sugar on the lady fingers. I substituted coffe liquour and creme de cacoa for the rum to give it more chocolate flavor which was one of the coments I recieved the first time I made it. Because they are very sweet I reduced the sugar in the filling by about 1/4 cup. To give it more chocolate flavor I also sprinkled grated chocolate and powdered cocoa on top of both layers. The result was perfect. I also make this in a square pan without the lady finger \"sides\" when I need to bring it to a function. Much easier to cut and serve and still delicious!",

Anyhow...the only thing I change is that I use an equal amount of Irish Cream instead of rum as I personally do not like the flavor of the rum. Aside from that this last time that I made it I tried what one reviewer suggested doubling the marscapone. I would NOT recommend it. The finished product was much firmer and easier to cut (more like that of a cheesecake) but the flavor was just totally off balance. I would recommend following the ORIGINAL recipe amounts exactly as that is the way that I received the most amount of compliments.",

I make the long side using a cookie sheet lined with a 6\" wide strip of parchment. I spread the cake batter 1/2\" thick on the parchment and bake. I then use a sizzor and cut the strip in half then square up the ends. (You end up with 2 strips that when cut square on the ends is un-noticeable) I leave the parchment paper on and brush with coffee mixture and place in the spring form pan (parchment facing outwards) I use a 9\" spring pan and make 8\" rounds with parchment lined cake pans for the bottom and middle layers. The presentation is incredible. This way you can only see the sides when the pan is removed. I also used emrils coffee and filling recipe with 2 cups of whipping cream instead of one.",

Although the lady fingers were yummy and I will use the recipe with a diff. filling recipe. I ended up buying ladyfingers for the circumfrance. If any of you live by a Polish deli I suggest the Polish ladyfingers as they are A LOT softer than the Italian ones. Look for a box that says \"Biszkopty\" on them.",

My Husband loved this. One thing I will do differently is soak the bottom layer a little more with the syrup. Mine was just a bit too bready still while the midddle layer just melted away in your mouth.",
