As for the method I cooked everything together in a wok and then added two cups of water. When that had cooked I added the other two cups of water. I didn't use any salt and used 2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also used fresh turmeric and ginger root. This recipe is nice with some minor changes it is a 5 star recipe. It made enough for 8 people so adjust according to your needs.",
