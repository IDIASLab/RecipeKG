I tried this recipe as I was curious as to why so many had poor result and so many good.  I work in a bakery and I have to say that I tend to agree with the poor results side.  The recipe is definitely gooey.  Either the liquid is wrong or the flour amount is wrong.  I did not add the 1/2 C of cold water to the yeast.  I simply poured the yeast into the first liquid step when the temp. cooled down a bit.  This worked great.  I kept the flour amount about the same and also I kneaded the dough for 10 mins.   I think that there are so many other great recipes out there that work everytime and it would serve you well to find one of those, especially beginners.",

I replaced; the warm water for warm milk the cold water for warm water(which I used to proof my yeast). More flour was called for but since I was used to light kneading of the dough I used the additional flour in the kneadind process. I made this for my Xmas dinner & everyone raved so much about them. I am now about to try to use the recipe to make cinnamon rolls. THANK YOU SO MUCH KATHY FOR SHARING!!",

I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast \"bloomed\" then I added melted margerine the egg and the dry ingredients. This dough needed 1 3/4 more flour than the recipe stated to get the dough into a ball and able to jump on a hook. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes then I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I got 11 smallish rolls out of this recipe not 18. I covered the top of the rolls in the muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes then brushed the tops of the hot rolls with vegetable oil right out of the oven. These rolls rose a little slow but the flavor of the rolls was very good. I liked that this roll asked for no milk no butter as I have a child with a milk sensitivity. I'd make these again--they remind me of rolls my Grandma used to make. No frills but comforting all the same.",
