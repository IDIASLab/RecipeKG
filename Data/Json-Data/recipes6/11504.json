Everything is \"natural\" and the added applesauce gives the cake an excellent moist texture and taste to it. I'm not a big \"cloves\" or \"allspice\" person so I added a \"pinch\" more of cinnamon and it still came out great. I also can't eat walnuts but added more dates raisins and cherries to the mix and you couldn't even notice the nuts weren't in the cake. I plan on making this cake for Christmas and the best part is that whatever is left (which there usually isn't any) I can wrap in plastic wrap and freeze! This recipe is definitely something worth trying!! I love it!!",
