I think it's important to always pound out the chicken to an even thickness to prevent over-cooking the thinner end and/or under-cooking the thick end. I pounded mine down to about a 1 1/4\" thickness.  I suggest you double the butter mixture as there was barely enough to coat 2 breasts, nevermind 4.  My chicken was done after 10 minutes, so start checking earlier than 12 minutes.",
