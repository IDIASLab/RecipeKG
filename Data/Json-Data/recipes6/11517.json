Make sure the foil is sealed. It warms it up then you don't have to wait to get to room temperature it is done in a matter of minutes. I do the same with eggs as well.  I leave the eggs in the shell in warm water for about 10 minutes and it does the job.\nI will keep this recipe for sure.",

I always bake my cheesecakes for like 15 minutes at 450 then reduce the oven temp to 250-275 and bake for like another 45min. Then I turn the oven off and let it cool in there for an hour or so. Then place in frige overnight. This way there is no crack and it will be perfectly creamy, no water bath needed!! If I make this again I'd probably add a tablespoon of lemon juice.",

I bake it in a 9\" nonstick round metal cake pan that I liberally spray with Butter Flavored Pam.  First time it cracked, second time it didn't. I don't mind the cracking though because I like the rustic look.  (Doesn't look machine made to me)\nI baked at 325 for 70 minutes.  It come out to about 135 calories per serving if the cake is cut in 12's.  So Rich that is all I need!  I'm thinking about serving it with berries today for color.  I really enjoy this recipe.

I was a little skeptical about this but gave it a go anyway. Oh.my.goodness.!! It was velvety smooth, creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness and a hint of vanilla. The shortbread cookie crust is a great idea, it set the cake off nicely.  For those of you who are having problems with cracking, bring your cream cheese, eggs and sour cream to room temp. The cream cheese must be perfectly soft; if you're pressed for time soak the packages in warm water and squish flat until warmed through. Mix the batter as little as possible-just until everything is blended. I've made this twice now and it's perfect. Quick, easy and simply delicious!",
