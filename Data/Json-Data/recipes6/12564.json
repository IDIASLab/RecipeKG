                "reviewBody": "Simply put, WOW!!! I did not make many alterations, as I like to try a recipe pretty much as written the first time. I did sub 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda, as I'm diabetic, and every little bit helps. In subsequent efforts, I have added 1 cup of halved fresh cranberries, and the color/tartness ratchets up the taste to stellar! The red from the cranberries and green flecks from the zucchini made it quite festive looking. That little kick of tartness from the berries makes the lemon flavor sing! No problem with excessive oiliness using the full cup, but you could shave off 2 TB without a problem if it makes you feel better.  Something told me to check on them about 10 minutes before the 45 minute alarm, and they were done, so only 35 minutes baking time was perfect. A toothpick in the center came out clean, and the center was firm to the touch. Be sure to disregard the baking times in the recipe and set your alarm for 35, at least to start. Overbaking could account for some of the tepid reviews. Please know they should turn out soft and moist, more like a cake than bars. After baking, I brushed on a glaze made from 2 Tb softened butter, 1 tsp fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp milk and 1 cup confectioners sugar, while they were still warm from the oven. It increased the fresh lemon flavor. It did not taste remotely \"oily\" (and as a trained chef, I have a ridiculously sensitive palate,) so I'd suspect that those who found an oily taste were using rancid or old oil.",

Good call, for us anyway, as this cake has a very delicate flavor, because it's not burdened with spices typically associated with zucchini breads/cakes.  I baked this as little cakes in small Bundt pans and gave them a lemon glaze of a cup of powdered sugar and 2 T. lemon juice - perfect to enhance that fresh, tart lemon flavor.  (Important note: there is NOT enough batter here for a standard size Bundt pan.  I know, because I tried - then dumped it out and filled small Bundt pans 2/3 full instead)",

I used half white and half brown sugar. I also added a lil extra lemon juice and extra zucchini to the mix. I partially peeled the skin from the zucchini so there was just a bit of greenness flecked throughout. The cake baked up in about 40 minutes in my bundt pan (make sure you grease/flour it well). This morning I made a glaze out of confectioners sugar and the juice/zest of half a lemon. I drizzled on top of the cake and let it seep down into the cake adding extra flavor and moisture. The results were a great balance of sweetness; tartness and wetness. My coworkers are thoroughly enjoying.",
