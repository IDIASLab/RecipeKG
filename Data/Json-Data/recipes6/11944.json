The recipe was clear as written and I had no problem.  The dough was so easy to work with and I could keep working it so I was able to use it all.  Made some like fingers and some round with a cookie cutter.  The only thing I would do different next time is use just the egg whites for the tops. (But I really should have known that ??)  These were delicious and nice and light and crunchie. A perfect cookie for afternoon tea or at night with a glass of wine.  Thank you Dan for a great recipe.",
