The bone-in skin on thighs however were not so great. I don't like to eat a sauced chicken with my fingers and it is too difficult to eat with a fork. I will either debone next time or buy boneless skinless thighs. As for the foil well that didn't go too well either. Live and learn! But I will definitely make the sauce again and try with other cuts of chicken. Thank you for a really nice recipe!",
