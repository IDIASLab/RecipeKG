I must admit that I didn't have all the ingredients available for this recipe so I used 1 lb. ground bison and 1/2 lb. veggie sausage. I also didn't have onion soup mix but I did have meatloaf seasoning and used that. Finally I made my own quick bleu cheese dressing. The results were very good -- very moist and tender with lots of flavor from the added ingredients. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again with the onion soup and ground turkey though I would stick to the 2:1 bison-to-turkey ratio for added body and compatibility with bleu cheese.",
