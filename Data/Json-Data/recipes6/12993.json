My complaint is that no where in the directions does it say that the dough NEEDS to be chilled. BUT it must be chilled (at least 2 hrs)in order to be able to roll and cut them out! Secondly use unsalted butter because this cookie is salty already from the Packaged ingredients. It's not a very good tasting cookie as it's so so salty with only a hint of sweetness. I added an additional tablespoon of sugar to it but I don't think thats enough. Not a very good cookie.",

My mom made this every St. Patrick's Day and m brother and sister and I all loved it. I don't know if the margarine thing is a typo or what. But 1/2 cup is what the original recipe calls for.",

The green wasn't as dark as I'd like so I added about five or six drops of green food coloring. Great! I agree with previous reviewers who say these are a little salty so it's a good thing that we like our salt! I think different pudding combos would be nice too. Oh and instead of trying to roll-and-cut them I just dropped them by rounded teaspoons on greased sheets and flattened them to about \" with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. 11 minutes done good.
