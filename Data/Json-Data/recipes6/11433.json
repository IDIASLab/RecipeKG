I followed the instructions with only 2 changes (because I needed to substitute) I used evaporated milk and 2 teas. of vanilla extract. I thought I had lemon in my cupboard but I was out! I used a 10 cup Bundt pan sprayed with Baker's Joy. Put the cake in a cold oven & set the oven for 350 degrees & timer for 80 minutes as instructed. The cake really got too brown but stil edible. I think next time I will lower the time to 55-60 minutes and keep checking. I think this is a great cake to have with tea or coffee. Hubby raved. His only comment is that he would have like a lemon flavor. Lemon peel would be good along with the extract. This is a keeper for us!",

Flavorful, with the ideal level of moistness, a result of getting the best of both worlds with the butter and shortening combination.  (I've experienced both pound cakes that have been too dry as well as those with far too much fat, causing them to be not moist, really, but greasy!) I used this for cupcakes and, just for fun, flavored them with pure watermelon extract, then frosted them with \"Grocery Store Frosting,\" recipe also from this site.",

I used margernine instead of butter b/c that's what I buy (WAY cheaper) since we go through so much of it and extra vanilla instead of lemon extract (didn't have any but I know it would be great with it!). Put it in two loaf pans and baked away. Mine was done in about an hour and a half I bumped a oven to watch if the middle moved and then tested it with a knife to make sure it was done. Tip: take 1 cup strawberries 1 c. sugar and one egg white beat it until stiff and serve on top. VERY GOOD! Thank you for a classic pound cake recipe.

I actually checked on it at 35 minutes and it was fairly brown by then so I covered it with foil during the remaining baking time so that it didn't overbrown. My DH does not like lemon so I subsituted an extra teaspoon of vanilla for the lemon extract. I was very happy with the results nice texture and taste. Buttery rich taste with a hint of sweetness. Would be wonderful with sugared sliced strawberries and whipped cream. We finished off a quarter of the cake on my birthday then froze the rest in individual pieces for a quick dessert in the coming months.",

I don't however believe that was in any way responsible for the dryness I experienced. I believe it was due to the unconventional baking method. I did as directed starting in a cold oven. I set the alarm to sound at one hour just because I was unfamiliar with baking an item this way and wanted to check it at that point. Good thing I did! When I pressed the center slightly it was quite firm. I inserted a toothpick in the middle just to be sure and it came out completely dry without even so much as a tiny crumb clinging to it. When I served it at a Fourth of July party I was grateful I had made 3 fruit compotes or the embarrassingly dry texture would have had nowhere to hide. I calibrate my oven every few weeks and the last time was last week; dead-on accurate so that wasn't the problem. I've worked as a pastry chef have over 40 years of experience baking so I'm known for my baked goods. This was not even close to my standards. I can only imagine how dry it would have been had I not yanked it at one hour. It might have fared better at 50 minutes. The taste was that of a generic pound cake nothing special but I would not recommend this recipe because there are much better out for flavor and they turn out enjoyably moist. In this case only the fruit and real whipped cream stood between me and culinary humiliation.",
