Mix one cup of sugar & the cinnamon - dip cut up biscuit sections in this and arrange in a heavily greased bundt pan. Pour remaining cin sugar mix on top.  Melt the butter and add the last 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar - bring to a light boil.  Pour over biscuit pieces.

I had fun cutting up the biscuits and rolling them in the cinnasugar and watching it take shape as it rose in the bundt. And the final results...delicious! Each piece of the bread is coated with cinnamon and sugar and gooey icing that you can just pull apart and eat for desert or for a breakfast treat. Everyone love, love, loved this. The only change I made to the recipe is a sprinkled the bottom of my bundt pan with pecans before I began layering.",
