Because my kids aren't too fond of pecans coconut and dates I used my food processor to blend these ingredients up fine so they just didn't see them as well. (What they can't see they can't complain about right?) Anyway they went over really well with them. I dinged this recipe only 1 star because it had a slight oil-y taste but it didn't detract from the cookies much. (Perhaps I should have used vegetable oil instead of canola...) It makes about a double batch of cookies so you can easily halve it and freeeze part. Thanks for a great recipe as printed.",

The flavor was a tiny bit bland; however I didn't use the dates or raisins and maybe the taste would have been improved by those additions. I will try it again with part whole wheat flour or more brown less white sugar or maybe a touch of spice. I do love the appearance and the crispy outside chewy center. I baked at 350 for about 10 minutes. Thank you Meredith.",

First they are very crumbly and dry when you put them on the baking sheet. Don't worry they rise a little and get chewy and are not dry. Don't worry about the lack of butter but use a good quality of oil. Also I tried the time at 10-14 minutes but had to cook 17-18 to get them to brown.",
