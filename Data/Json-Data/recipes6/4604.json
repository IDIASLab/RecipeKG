EVERYONE enjoyed it even the finicky eaters!! I am not a fan of hot spicy food so I used only half the amount of the ground red pepper but next time I will use the full amount. For more of an Asian taste I would suggest substituting green onion in place of the regular onion that the recipe calls for and add crushed peanuts as a finishing touch! Otherwise this recipe is AWESOME and I will definitely make again in the near future!!!! The peanut sauce is PERFECT as is. It's smooth thick and creamy and makes the dish quite filling.",

I doubled the recipe and added little more peanut butter than it called for and doubled the red pepper flakes we love it spicy and sweet! If you like less sweet add less brown sugar and honey than what it calls for. I added 3 thin sliced chix breast as well. Cooked everything in my well seasoned wok turned out perfect. Cooked Chicken before the veg's and cooked everything in peanut oil not veg oil. Did not add the Sake but added a couple of tbs of rice wine vinegar to counter the sweetness of honey and brown sugar.",

To save time - and a pot - I microwaved the sauce for about two minutes to thicken and cook. This was exactly what I was in the mood for. A nice salty/sweet flavour and the sauce sticks well to the noodles. I added chicken to mine as well and the flavours all melding beautifully. Love this and will definitely make again.",

I left the red pepper out of the sauce and threw in chopped habeneros jalapenos and chiles from our garden (two each) with the stir fry. Perfect heat. Makes you sweat but doesn't burn as long as you core the peppers (no seeds or pulp from the center). The sauce is the winning part. No need for the Sake if you don't have it around.",

My American and Canadian friends love it my Mexican friends aren't quite as impressed...spicy and sweet I don't think goes well with the Mexican pallet...they're more into spicy and salty or spicy and tart.
