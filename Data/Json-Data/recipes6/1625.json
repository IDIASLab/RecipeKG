I wanted to stay true to the original recipe but I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup (watching sugar carbs) and also added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a little zing.  Rather than steam the broccoli, I just added it right after adding the cornstarch slurry and it was perfect after 30 minutes!  I'll definitely make this again - next time I may add sliced onion near the beginning of the cooking and red pepper strips with the broccoli.",

I used Better than Boullion, light soy sauce, garlic powder and a flank steak, because that's what I had on hand and it still turned out delicious and we didn't think too salty.  I also threw in a sliced sweet onion like another reviewer suggested.  Great, easy recipe with very minimal prep that I will be making again.  The sauce is thinner and less sticky than restaraunt style broccoli beef, but no complaints here anyway.",

I also used 2 sixteen ounce bags of frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh broccoli.  I found that after cooking 6 hours on LOW the thinly sliced beef I used had fallen apart mostly.  But that was ok. If you want your beef to hold together more in slices it's probably best to only cook for 4-5 hours or use thick chunks of beef instead of slicing it thin like you would for a regular stir fry.  The sauce never thickened for me, but I didn't bother cooking it down in a sauce pan.  There was plenty of juciness for the quinoa I served this with to soak up!! I will make this again.  Leftovers are great!",
