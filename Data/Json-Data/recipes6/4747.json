I added chicken cream and cheese after cooking the broccoli and onion in a slow cooker for four hours. I found it more filling and flavorful after. Fair warning when you cook just the broccoli and onion it smells really bad. It smelled and tasted better after blending and adding the cream and cheese. Probably will top with more cheese and it can certainly stand to hold more chicken as well.",
