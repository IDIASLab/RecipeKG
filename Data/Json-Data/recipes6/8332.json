Next time I think I'll deliberately make two diffent sized patties putting my filling on the smaller one and topping with the larger hamburger patty to make more secure topper and edge. I omitted the BBQ sauce (not a bit fan of it) and added the slightest bit of powdered garlic. For the life of me I can't grill hamburgers without their falling into the flame so I pan-fried these and it worked wonderfully. Boyfriend raved about how good these are and I agree. Thank you for a fun different and tasty way to make hamburgers!",

I used a full pound of cooked bacon but did not mix it with the cooked onions. After cooking onions in bacon grease I placed several paper towels on top of onions (and then discarded) to get rid of excess grease. I allowed onions to fully cool. Then divided among 8 patties evenly. I divided cooked bacon among those 8 patties... and then divided EXTRA Sharp Cheddar cheese (shredded)on top of the 8 patties. I sealed the edges well and refrigerated for at least 1/2 hour. Hubby grilled and all raved! Somehow with 8 burgers... only 4 four were fed. Tonight I had to double this recipe. They could not wait for the burgers to be cooked quickly enough! Totally Awesome!!! I think it's important to allow all cooked ingredients (bacon and onions) to cool fully before assembling burgers... and especially allow burgers to be refrigerated at least 1/2 hour prior to grilling. This will help keep burgers from falling apart in the grilling process.",
