My hubbie requests this by saying 'I'd like to eat more salad'.  I cut WAY back on the sugar (3.5 Tblsp) and onion (4-5 Tblsp), and reduced the oil to 1/4C.  Didn't have horseradish, so I used cayenne (to taste), and I really like garlic, so I used 1.5 teaspoon of minced.  And LOTS of fresh ground pepper.  I think I could probably use even less oil to make it healthier.  Thanks a lot for the recipe, it is a winner at our house!",
