Of course I didn't have the 1 T. of bacon drippings to add but that just made the dish healthier. Omitted the cumin. Reminded me of a BLT with the mayo tomato and bacon flavors. Just be sure to de-seed the tomatoes and drain off as much liquid as possible before adding to the salad to minimize the wateriness of the dressing.",
