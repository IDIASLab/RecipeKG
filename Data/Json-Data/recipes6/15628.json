I didn't have some of the ingredients to make an actual pumpkin pie so we opted for this one and I am so glad that I did.  I think we all liked it better than pumpkin pie and it's so easy (my 3 year old helped make it)!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!  P.S. One change I did make was that I didn't have any pumpkin spice so I added A LOT of cinnamon probably about 2 Tbsp. if not more - I didn't measure, about 1 1/2 tsp. of ground all spice and about 1 1/2 tsp. of ground nutmeg ",

So far, I have changed the bottom crust by adding 1/3 cup of brown sugar and half tsp vanilla, and only use the white of the egg.  It was too wet using the WHOLE egg.  This made a sugar cookie-like spreadable dough that you can easily spread with your fingers without being a sticky mess.  Second..I added a bit more spice to the pumpkin center and some cinnamon and a little extra brown sugar, a touch of vanilla and a dash of salt.  Third, the TOP crust...USE brown sugar instead....white...its much better, and be sure your butter is CHILLED.  If it doesn't come out crumbly enough..just add a little more brown sugar and flour.  Give it a try...maybe someone else can come with some ideas too, its a great base recipe!! thanks!",

However i would recommend you go light on the sugar in the pumpkin mixture. the cakemix butter topping is very very rich so it's best to go a little lighter on the pumpkin layer.
