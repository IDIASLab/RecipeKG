It turns out to be a very large pie with a layer of custard, topped with a layer of blueberries, and then a layer of meringue.  If you like blueberries, its a keeper.  My Grandma always said that you could make a smaller pie by using a pint of blueberries, but we have never tested that theory.",

                "reviewBody": "This is an EXCELLENT old-fashioned recipe.  I can understand why this got a few bad reviews-it's a tad complicated to put together the first time around.  Here's my 2cents worth to make this pie a little easier to make: When I beat the yolks and sugar together, I could not get all the sugar to dissolve.  To remedy this, I added my lemon juice next (and, in fact, I used the juice of \u00bd lemon) and beat this nice and smooth.  Instead of tapioca, I added 3 tablespoons of flour to this mixture. (I prefer flour to tapioca as a thickener in my pie: either will do nicely) Then add the salt, stir in the milk,and then the blueberries.In a separate bowl, beat your egg whites nice and stiff, and gently fold into the blueberry mixture.Sprinkle the flour and sugar into the pie shell as the recipe suggests,and pour in the filling.I found the top of the pie turned golden very quickly;I tented tinfoil over the top to slow this down for the rest of the baking time.BE SURE to tent it \u2018high',this pie rises like a souffle during baking, (then sinks as it cools) and if the top touches the foil,you will lose your meringue-like crust! I also covered my crust edge in foil to prevent browning.The end result is a mouth-watering, seconds-please blueberry pie unlike any other.There is a thin \u2018custard' like bottom, a creamy blueberry middle, and a thin meringue crust.You will NOT be disappointed with this one-THANK YOU,Barbara, for sharing this family treasure!",

He did not have a stand alone mixer so I incorporated the eggs and sugar with a hand mixer and stopped after 6 minutes. Also I was using a prepared pie shell which made a big difference (I used a 9\" shell). The pie was good but I could see the potential!! When I came home I started all over again - this time with my stand alone mixer. I beat the yolks a full 15 minutes and incorporated the sugar over 10 of those minutes. This step made the big difference. Also I cut back to 1 pt of blueberries. Those two changes and the pie was superb!! Give it a chance - you won't regret.",

I'm not sure my sugar completely dissolved in mixing even after 15 minutes of beating plus beating with lemon juice but it didn't affect the outcome.
