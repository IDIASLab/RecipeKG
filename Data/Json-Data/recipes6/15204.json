Double the tomato sauce, add some salt and lots of pepper, saute some onion, peppers, and garlic with the ground turkey - so much better.

I did take the reccommendations of other reviewers and mixed the noodles with the meat and used seasoned chopped tomatos instead of plain tomato sauce.  I also seasoned the meat by adding pepper, garlic salt, oregano, cilantro, onions, and garlic.  I also added frozen peas to add veggies to this quick, one-dish meal.  My husband thought it was lasagna.  I EVEN GOT A THUMBS UP FROM MY MOTHER-IN-LAW!!!  I will definitely make this dish again.  I can see this dish becoming a family favorite in my household.",

I would TRIPLE the tomatoe sauce if I made this again. I also would definitely recommend adding spices to the meat as it's cooking and some oregano when the sauce is added or this dish would be pretty bland even w/ the sour cream and cream cheese. I used lowfat sour cream and nuefchatel (lowfat) cream cheese which seemed to work fine for that layer but DON'T use lowfat or fat free cheese on top it just doesn't have the melting power and richness needed for a recipe like this (learned the hard way).",

I added milk instead of water fat free sour cream a little curry and red pepper flakes for those that suggested it was a bit bland. I used a bunch of onion and garlic in the stir fry with the 1 pound of lean ground turkey. Also added some 2% sharp cheddar and some Trader Joes New Zeeland goat fed sharp cheddar and a coup of microwaved frozen green peas. My POC (pasta of choice) was whole wheat rotini...about 16 oz's. Hamburger helper would be lucky to associate itself with this. Don't forget the diced Shitake mushrooms I added to the stir fry. See my other reviews to get an idea how to alter recipes to fit your tastes...flexibility to fit what you have in stock is the key to many as suggested by other reviewers. Many of my versions involve lower fat editions...with lean grd Turkey...not much else to do with this one. Eat up dudes and dudettes.",
