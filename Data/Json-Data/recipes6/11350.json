He asked me to try and duplicate it, well this one came out better, sorry Glady's! I did add a few ingredients to enhance the flavors. 1/2 c chopped pecans and 1/2 tea cinnamon to crust. I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tea cinnamon, 1/4 tea nutmeg, 1/4 tea ginger and 2 tea  vanilla to filling. I used 2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes (definately bake the potatoes adds flavor). Don't over beat the filling and put a shallow pan of water on the rack below the cake for a flawless cheesecake w/o cracks every time. Baked 1hr 10 mins in 9\" pan, removed from oven immediately when center was almost set. This cake is super rich and delicious, absolutely worth the effort. If you love cheesecake and sweet potatoe pie, you'll love this cake. Will be making this often.",

I added some flavor(nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice) to the sweet potato puree, as if I were making a sweet potato pie.  I also cooked this in a waterbath, which added to the silky texture.  And finally, I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping, which was the perfect touch!  Great recipe for those who love sweet potato pie!",

And I don't think people would have eaten it without the pecan topping (which is amazing btw)... Taste and texture are okay but this makes avery heavy dessert. Not everybody is ready for that kind of cheesecake!",
