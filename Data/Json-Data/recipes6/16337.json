Plus the dough isn't flaky like the types you find in egg tarts bought from an asian bakery. I am asian and I wasn't terribly impressed by this recipe... the pastry was easy to work with but you should roll the pastry thinner than 1/8'' so you get more egg custard and less pastry in the tart. I'd also advise you to not take out the egg tarts immediately once they are done baking but to open the oven door and leave them in for a little longer. This is to keep them from deflating too quickly and cracking in the middle. I'll be working on improving this I'm sure it can be improved a lot after a few tries thanks!",

I was too lazy to roll out the dough so I did as one reviewer suggested and rolled them into balls then pressed them into the pans. The end result was wonderful but was very bland. I have no idea why the sugar probably didn't melt. The texture was wonderful and the custard was so pretty. I gave my professor some and he loved it. My boyfriend did too. I will try this again and hopefully the next time will yield me sweeter tarts.:) thanks so much for the recipe!",

The first night I took the time to roll out the dough and make the individual tarts but it took forever! However it was easier to eat and tasted great. For the second batch I was a little bit in a hurry so I made the mistake of not beating the eggs all the way. MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN! The final product was yellow and white and tasted a little bit funny. Also for the second batch I made one giant custard-pie instead of the individual tarts. This also tasted fine but you have to increase the baking time for a few minutes in order to cook the center but be careful not to burn the crust. This recipe is just so perfect and if you use a light butter for the crust it is healthy too! Also for both of the batches I did not have evaporated milk so instead I melted 1 tablespoon of butter into 1/4 cup milk and it tasted fine.",
