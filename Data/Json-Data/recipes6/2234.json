We didn't miss it at all, but next time may use more bell pepper to make up for this.  Also subbed Heinz Chili Sauce for catsup, as I prefer it to catsup.  Also cut the sugar in half, and next time may leave it out altogether.  Added a bit of lemongrass, for a more authentic flavor.  Also added some red chili (the kind from a tube) as we like our food spicy.  May add more red chili next time. And finally, instead of using it as a garnish, I added the chopped cilantro for the last two minutes of cooking, and used a bit more than called for.  It is a good starting recipe that can be fine-tuned to suit personal preferences.  Thanks, Chef John.",
