I don't think the parchment is necessary and wouldn't bother to use it again. Made this in 2 bread tins to give away and had 1 small mini loaf for myself:) the batter is more like dough but easy to work with.",

I mixed a simple syrup with a mixture of whiskey brandy and rum and brushed it all over the cake. Then I wrapped it up in plastic wrap then foil and put it in a tin and placed in a cool place to age. I repeated with the liquor again and let it sit a couple of weeks. It tasted wonderful to my family and friends.
