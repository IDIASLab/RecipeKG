I did not have fresh thyme so I subbed a scant TBS of dried.  There was not a whole lot of sauce so I pan fried two small breasts and 6 thighs with a spray of oil and because I didn\u2019t have lemon zest I sprinkled them generously with lemon pepper.  I popped the pan into the hot oven with the sauce on top.  The sauce packed a great punch of flavor.  I\u2019ll make this again.",
