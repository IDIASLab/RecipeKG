I can't imagine anyone rating these pies less than 5 stars. You just can't mess them up. Thank you Grandma Ople!! One alteration that made it a tad healthier still is I made a whole wheat pie crust. (Recipe: 3/4cup butter softened; 1/3cup water; 1/4 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp sugar; 1 cup whole wheat flour; 1 cup white flour. It's meant to be 2 crusts but I squeeze 3 out of it. Roll between 2 sheets of wax paper. Super easy.)",
