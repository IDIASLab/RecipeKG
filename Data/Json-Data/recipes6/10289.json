As written it would be a bit too bland for me but with tweaks it was delicious. I don't have a bread machine so did this by hand. Plumped about 8 sundried tomatoes in 1 cup of water and used the water for plumping in the bread. Also crushed 2 cloves of garlic added double (at least) asiago and also added parmesan. Didn't have amaranth flour so used spelt. Any kind of nutty earthy flour can be used to replace the Amaranth. Tuscan blend seasoning for the basil. This took about 75 minutes to proof on the first rising and about 50 minutes on the second. Baked at 400 for 30 minutes and it produced a beautiful loaf soft on the inside. Make sure that you don't chop the tomatoes too fine..they get lost in the bread. I'm glad I had some in larger pieces. Veriations are endless. Could also throw in some calamata olives. This is sure to compliment any Mediterranean or Italian based dinner. The color is lovely with using the water from the tomatoes. Thanks for this recipe which is sure to please DH.",

I used only 1-1/2 tsp. of sugar because that's my preference (don't like any sweet taste in my bread) 1-1/2 tsp. of bread machine yeast and all bread flour. I used a very good quality fresh Asiago and 1-1/2 tsp. of my favorite Tuscan seasoning. I really don't like moist overly fluffy smooshy breads and this bread is SO not like that! This bread would make wonderful croutons crostini bruschetta panini (mmmm chicken provolone and pesto!) or even grilled cheese but it is so flavorful so delicious on its own. Just a great recipe!",

You'll have to find it in a gourmet food or natural foods market. Make sure you use GOOD Asiago cheese and be generous with it.......be generous with the sun-dried tomato as well.
