I must have already made 60 cookies and then just dumped the remainder of the batter into a brownie pan for pan cookies. The recipe said it made 30 cookies but they must have been the size of pie plates in that case. I was also worried about how runny the batter was but it did turn out fine the batter doesn't spread much. Good but not great in my opinion.",
