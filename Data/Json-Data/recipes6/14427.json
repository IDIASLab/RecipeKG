I thought the amount of cornstarch to be too large but decided to follow to the letter (I allways do this the first time with any recipie.) Basicaly it gelled in the pan before the cooking was complete. It was the consistency of stuffing or bread pudding when we tried to get it out of the pan. As it cooled it got even firmer finaly becoming a hard starchy ball of glop (although very good tasting glop). This recipie HAS to be wrong. I've looked at some other ones and am pretty convinced that it's not 2/3rds cup of starch but 2 to 3 tablespoons of corn starch... I'd like to hear other peoples experience with this as well. Thanks!",

I know that Fereni (or 'zaghoughou') as it is called in North Africa is supposed to be thick but at the very beginning I questioned the ratio of cornstarch to liquid. Against my better judgement I followed the recipe and had to double the amount of milk so it would not be nothing but a blob of paste. I toasted the almonds first bruised the green cardamom pods and had to add 2 tbsp. more sugar. With these changes my husband's eyes lit up and it has made for a nice Eid holiday dessert. It is only slightly sweet with the 2 extra tbsp. of sugar; with the quarter cup it was barely noticeable and overpowered by the taste of cornstarch. Perhaps our cornstarch is different here in the states. I'll make again and again just with the changes. As written I just can't justify giving this recipe more stars. There has to be a mistake with the amt. of cornstarch. Maybe it should read 2 or 3 tbsp instead of 2/3 cup?",
