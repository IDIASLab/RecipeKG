Instead I could just add less brown sugar to reduce sweetness. I also add flax seeds usually and whole peanuts when I don't have crunchy peanut butter. It's difficult to stop eating them because they're somewhat virtuous but really I should be treating them like a cookie.",

Next time I will add more oatmeal and probably more peanut butter and cook the syrup longer so they aren't so soft. It is very humid today and they are just too soft!! Great recipe for a no-bake.",
