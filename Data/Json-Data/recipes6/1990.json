I used The Dry Onion Soup Mix recipe since I had the ingredients on hand - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Dry-Onion-Soup-Mix . I was sad that my small town grocery store didn't have any boneless pork shoulder roasts in stock (or anything similar to substitute), so I substituted boneless/skinless chicken thighs. It wasn't my original intention to use chicken, but it turned out awesome! It was very easy to shred and the guys in my household enjoyed it. The sandwiches are even tastier with raw onion slices and pickle slices (if you like). Great to stuff in a loaded baked potato the next day, or in a quesadilla with cheddar and a few black beans. The filling really works (and it would with the pork as well!). Thanks!! :)",

The pork fell apart after about 5 hours on low in the crock pot. The sauce was a bit thin so I added some barbecue sauce to the buns to give it some \"oomph\".",
