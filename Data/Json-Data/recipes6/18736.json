Most date & nut breads I've tried are light in color and not nearly as moist as this one. I tried baking it in the little mini pans and it comes out perfect. It makes about 2 or 3 mini loaves (fill about 2/3 full so they don't drip over) and bake at he same degrees between 45 to 60 min. Great for Holiday gifts. I also added a few extra dates and chopped the nuts coarse by hand to give the bread a nice crunchy texture. Tenting with some foil half way through is a suggestion from another reviewer that is helpful since the bread will get dark fairly soon in the cooking process. A MUST TRY recipe for all you date nut bread lovers out there! THANK YOU Karen for submitting this WONDERFUL recipe!!",
