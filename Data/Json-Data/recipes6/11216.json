I made it in an 8-inch springform pan I would suggest that you put a parchment round in the bottom of the pan to make it easier to get the pie out of the pan. I used parchment paper on top rather than wax paper also. the crust does need some butter with the cookie crumbs and I believe it needs a little bit more than a half a cup, next time I'm going to try 3/4 cup of crumbs.",
