I got hung up at work and didn't get home to turn off the slow cooker until after the poor pork had been in it's hot tub for more than 6 hours! Flavor was exactly what I thought it would be... call it American Asian Fusion. Served with brown rice and roasted asparagus with parmesan. Very nice! My pork was over cooked... yours won't be if you follow the instructions. I'm giving it 4 stars because I know what it can be... and really not a bad 3 stars personally because of my impossible work schedule.",

I also had some veggies to use up so I threw in a lot of onion instead of dried scallion a few chunks of red and green bell pepper and a pile of carrots I steamed on top for the last two hours. I Telya it was delicious I saved two portions for lunch I made one portion for myself. I only used three porkchops but I made the full amount of sauce and poured it all over quinoa. Highly recommended the chili sauce is a great touch.",
