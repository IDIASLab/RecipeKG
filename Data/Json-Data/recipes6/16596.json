I also used black licorice wheels by Haribo for the tail. This worked well because they are wound-up so the tails curled well. Next time I will shape them into balls before the chill time. I lost patience with how long it was taking to mold the chilled dough and I think the chill is important to keep them from flattening out. My kids reminded me of another fun Christmas mouse I made...you take a marachino cherry that has the stem on and dip it in chocolate. Then take a Hershey kiss and lay both on their sides on waxed paper as you touch the bottom of the kiss to the bottom of the cherry. The point of the kiss is the nose and the stem of the cherry is the tail. Then quickly slip two almond slices in between the kiss and cherry as ears (with the rounded part up). Allow chocolate to dry and then come back later and make eyes with a toothpick using royal icing melted white chocolte or even the frosting you can buy in a tube. Remember the ears are kinda fragile. My dad loves these because he is a big chocolate cherry fan!! Thanks for posting the peanut butter Christmas mice. They are more old fashioned looking than the cherry mice and I was looking for an old fashioned Christmas this year!",
