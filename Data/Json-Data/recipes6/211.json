The sugar will harden as well as the bacon. Then finely chop and add to the mixture as directed. We added a Raspberry liqueur as well for a hit of Maple raspberry. Lots of flavor's little servings is all that's needed.",

You do need to make sure the bacon is cooked crispy so it holds up in the ice cream without getting soggy. Also make sure to taste the cream base to make sure you get a good maple flavor. I ended up adding more syrup because I was using real maple syrup.",

I used a grated cookie cooling tray to lay the bacon on while it cooked so it would be able to drain off the grease. Worked like a charm.",
