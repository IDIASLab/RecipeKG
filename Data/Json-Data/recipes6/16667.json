They were out of this world good!! I did bake them for 30 mins instead of 20.  SENSATIONAL!!!  Thanks!",

Tip:  don't try to cut them right out of the refrigerator.  The topping will be rock hard!",

We ended up cutting the bars much smaller. They are very thick so next time we will try making these in a bigger pan. We also cut down on the chocolate. In a bigger pan thinner bar cookies will result and following the chocolate recipe as listed will give plenty of chocolate covering. Will definately make these again.",
