I have made these several times now with a few modifications that make people come begging for more: I doubled the spices (if not more), used only 2 cups sugar, left out the walnuts and added about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Lastly, instead of making bread, I made muffins...TO DIE FOR!!  In standard muffin cups the muffins take about 30 minutes to bake at 350.  With these changes, NOW it is a 5-star recipe!! EDITED TO ADD: I decided to try a LOW-FAT version of these and it turned out GREAT!  Adding to my previous modifications, I also substituted 1/2 of the oil for applesauce.  There was absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in taste or moistness.  No brainer, save the calories and fat!!",

I'm an experienced baker who generally can get a pretty good idea of what the finished product will be by reading the recipe. This recipe seemed to have all the right ingredients and proportions (albeit a little light on the spice but I was still willing to give it a shot as written) so I have no idea what could have accounted for the fact that it just was not what I had expected or hoped for. I agree with other reviewers particularly \"MommyofFour \" who found the bread \"too moist lacking in flavor and almost eggy.\" Perhaps it's just a personal preference or perception. Until I come across something better I'll hang on to my good ol' recipe on the beat up recipe card I wrote out when I was a kid--so far it's still the best.",
