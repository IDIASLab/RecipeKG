While I did cut back on the oil (used 1/4 cup) you need to hit cancel/keep warm and after release of pressure put back on Brown or Saut\u00e9. I used Brown on my instapot. Then you cook it all down another 20 minutes or so.  All nice and crispy. I have a great pic if they let you post pics.",

These are not crispy at all (a little mushy, in fact). and almost all of the reviews  (as of this one) note \"not crispy\". One reviewer said she was able to get them crispy adding another saute onto receipe, at the end. But my potatoes were so tender form previous steps that they just began turning to mush upon trying. (another reviewer used the oven as an additional step - but then what's the point of the instant pot, since oven was my previous method, and by the time you saute, pressurize, cook , and depressurize - then transfer to oven and roast - you haven't  really saved time over oven. So - sorry to say , this is a total no-go for me.",
