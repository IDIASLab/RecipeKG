I made both of the recipe submitter broccoli tots recipes and the only change I made was to add bacon to this one as well. I preferred these ones and hubs preferred the Broccoli Bacon Ranch Tots. We both agreed that both were excellent though. Again the key is in step 4. Get as much moisture out of the broccoli as you possibly can. These are a bit time consuming but well worth it in the end. Excellent recipe!",
