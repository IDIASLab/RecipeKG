The only ingredient changes that I made were that I used only 4 cups of veggie broth and tippled the tomatoes because I prefer more of a new than a soup, and tomatoes are delicious.  I also threw in some red, green, and yellow peppers.  The only other thing I changed was the spices.  I love more spicy dishes, so I included a tsp + of one of my favorite spice blends from a local spice/olive oil/vinegar market.  I will definitely make it again.",
