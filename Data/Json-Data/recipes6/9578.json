I also omitted the bell peppers, only used half of an onion, and seasoned the meat with salt and pepper, and garlic powder while the meat and onions were browning.  I ended up using three large potatoes, which needed about four tablespoons of butter, and about a half a cup of milk (also added salt and pepper to the mashed potatoes).  Next time I will probably use an extra half can of regular corn as well, and maybe a little more meat, just to make it a deeper caserole.  Overall this was a definite hit that I will make often :) Scarlett",

First of all I do not use a pie shell. I cook this in a 9x13 pan (which I grease first) & instead of layering the corn & hamburg mixture I mix it all together (I also use the onion garlic parmasean cheese salt/pepper Bay's seasoning-you can really mix up your spices with this recipe to help add some \"zing\"). I use creamed corn AND regular whole kernel corn & I only add a touch of milk to add SOME liquid. Once this is all poured into the 9x13 pan I then top it with the mashed potatoes & put some salt/pepper/paprika on top & bake at 350 until it starts to bubble. At the very end I will set it on broil (Low) just to help form a little top \"crust\" on the potatoes (watch this so it will not burn..does not take long). My family loves this. They also like to add a little ketchup to it once it is on their plates for extra flavoring.",
