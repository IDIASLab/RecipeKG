                "reviewBody": "These cookies are delicious!  Five tips I learned after baking them a few times: 1) Hermits are an antique cookie dating back to colonial times.  White flour was not available until the late 1800s, so these taste wonderful w/ the original whole wheat as long as you get fresh flour.  Whole wheat flour should not be bitter.  If it is, it is rancid and should be replaced w/ a different brand.  2) The problem w/ the sticky texture is caused by the egg, probably a recent addition to the recipe.  I made it w/o the egg & the dough was easier to handle, & results superb.  3) Don't mix the soda w/ the coffe.  Put it w/ the dry ingredients so it retains its leavening power.  4) A tasty variation is to sub frozen oj concentrate & grated orange zest for the coffee.  This version needs less sugar.  5) It can be made as a single 1/3\" layer instead of strips, cooked a few minutes more, & sliced while warm, if you'd rather not fiddle w/ the dough. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I agree w/ reviewers who recommend increasing the spices.  These end up the tastiest \"healthy\" cookie I've ever had.",

Add about 3/4 cups extra flour to make sure the dough is \"dough-y\" enough and chill for half an hour before trying to shape it. Make sure the coffee is strong so you get the flavor and I added some ginger to add a kick to it. Also these cookies spread and puff up so make sure there's about 2 inches between the long strips on the cookie sheet-- I'd use two separate sheets.",

I've tried several recipes and this comes the closest to the original.  When I made them as bars, they never baked to the right consistency, so I tried them as drop cookies and they're perfect. (12 minutes per batch, same temperature - I also chopped the 1 cup raisins for better consistency).  This will be a keeper in our family now for generations!",

I don't generally like strong molasses flavors but the coffee (I made it extra strong almost like espresso) gives it an entirely different twist. I added 1c chocolate chips and I like the combination. Might be nice with nuts as well. The dough was really soft and ended up spreading into essentially one big cookie in the oven but it cooked OK without burning; next time I'll add the extra flour someone else suggested.

As for the taste it tastes like a graham cracker but with a lot less sugar and a lot less crispy. This is a soft cookie but crispy on edges. I drizzled some white almond bark on top and woh did it make a difference. It made a good presentation and actually brought out the flavors of the cookie.",
