But the dough was way too sticky and looked like a pile of \"you know what\" on my cookie sheet. The flavor of these cookies is not the best either. I can't taste any of the pumpkin too much spices. I ended up dropping these onto the sheet. The frosting is also horrible! I've never made frosting with this consistency before. Too runny and tastes too much like powdered sugar. Over all not a good baking experience as far as quality. At least I had fun with my kids though!",
