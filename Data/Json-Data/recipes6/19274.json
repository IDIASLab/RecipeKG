Being from the South it is hard to find any true southern cooking in Lansing MI until I came across this recipe. It is very easy to make and does not consume a lot of time. Will definently make this again very tasty and reminds me of a taste of Alabama very good recipe.",

Given the previous review I increased the amount of buttermilk to 1.75 cups and accordingly also increased the cracklin' to 1.5 cups. This was tasty! My husband is from the south and grew up on cracklin' bread; he liked it a lot. We all agree that some jalapeno next time will make this perfect!",
