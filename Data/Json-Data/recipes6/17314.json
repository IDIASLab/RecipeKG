I baked mine in 2 (9x5 inch) loaf pans; it filled them about halfway which was perfect. I think it would work well in 2 (8x4 inch) loaf pans also. I topped mine with a coconut streusel made with 1/4 cup butter flour sugar and coconut. It's easy to remember because it's all equal amounts. Just mix until crumbly. The cake was very moist and good. I make this for my girlfriend's family and they all love it even those who are jealous!",
