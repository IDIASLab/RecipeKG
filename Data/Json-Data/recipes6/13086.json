I think this is very close to the cookies I remember eating as a child. I loved them! It worked out quite well with the hand carved mold as long as the dough was kept cold. A little additional flour improved the detail of the mold designs. I never knew the name of the cookie until now but believe the spelling would be Weinachstollen.",
