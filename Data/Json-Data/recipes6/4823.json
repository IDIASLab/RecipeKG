I can't believe it, but it tastes even better. I make this soup once a week, and we never get tired of it!",

Turns out these ingredients all create an amazing flavor that you simply cannot imagine until you try it. It's akin to a slightly sweet nutty minestrone. I think that the sweet potato zucchini and cumin are all critical ingredients for achieving the right flavor. Even with the jalape\u00f1o the kick was minimal. I used fresh Cuban oregano as that's what I had on hand in the garden. Next time I might experiment with more spice but I will definitely put the quinoa in maybe 5 or so minutes later than the spices since I felt like it was a bit over-cooked. The nutritional value of these ingredients is very high and I felt energized after a bowl of this soup. Overall this is a delicious healthy and very unique recipe that becomes a fun talking point among those you make it for.",

I used more of the spices (about 1 tablespoon of cumin and oregano and probably about 1 to 2 teaspoons of cayenne because it dumped out of the container). Also added a little more quinoa about 3/4 c total to absorb some extra liquid so it came out more like a stew. I thought the cayenne would be too strong but I think it came out just right for my tastes.",
