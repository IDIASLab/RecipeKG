The recipe reads \"until mixture thickens.\"  Not having cooked a recipe like this before, I had no idea how long to cook it.  A time frame would have been helpful, as a guide at least.

It is still in the oven; it's only been in the oven for an hour and the crust has already burned. Perhaps the people who have had great success with this recipe know what to do so that their crust is not burning and hopefully can share with the rest of us I had to take them out and try and wrap foil aroung the crust to pretect it but that is no easy task when something has already been baking for an hour. I guess protect it from the get-go?I also want to note that once the milk goes in with the rice it takes at least 30 minutes if not a bit more for it to thicken enough for use. I hope it tastes better than it looks right now.",
