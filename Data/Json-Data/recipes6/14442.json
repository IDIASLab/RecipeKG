I changed it a bit though...I used a whole bag of frozen raspberries and raspberry balsamic vinegar like you recommended. I put it over a salad that contained baby greens and fresh bananas nectarines strawberries walnuts and goat cheese. It was a huge hit and I will make it again often...what a super springtime treat for luncheons!!! Many thanks for a healthful recipe.",

A couple of preparation/storing notes: Don't cheat and try to use a hand blender because you will end up with raspberry juice all over your clothes and counter and that stuff doesn't come up easily. Also if you store this in a plastic container be aware that said container will end up permanently raspberry colored and flavored.",
