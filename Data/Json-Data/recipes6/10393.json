They look like they will freeze well but who am I kidding...they aren't going to last that long. I put the leftovers in a ziplock bag sucked out the excess air and stashed them in the refrigerator...until tomorrow morning!",

These buttermilk-base scones definitely turned out the best in flavor, and consistency.    I personally like a little more sugar in mine, so I put in about 1/4 a cup of sugar.  I also like to brush the tops with a bit more buttermilk and sprinkle sugar.  I have done all sorts of scones with this as a base recipe--fresh strawberry, chocolate chip, dried cranberry, dried blueberry, dried cherry....I like the dried fruit ones the best!  I usually soak the dried fruit in some water in the microwave for about 20 seconds, then drain the excess and pop them in the batter.    Definitely try this recipe if you're looking for a good scone.",
