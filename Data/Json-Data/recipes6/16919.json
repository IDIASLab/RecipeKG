My grandmother made it for my father when he was a boy and it is still his favorite candy to this day. It is a favorite candy of most members of my family in-laws included! No it's not caramel. The best way I can describe it is to call it caramel fudge but then there is bound to be somebody who thinks it should be chocolaty too if I say 'fudge'. I make very good fudge and the year I included this with my fudge NOBODY ate the regular fudge and my my brother in law BEGGED me to make him some more Aunt Bill's just for him! Does anybody know an easier way to beat the sheen out of it? It kills my elbow and I don't have a heavy duty mixer. Is there a mixer heavy duty enough to do this?",
