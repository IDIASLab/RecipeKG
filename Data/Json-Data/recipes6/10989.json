I remember that I had six pieces of it while my mother and grandmother were talking! It was gone by the next day, and guess who ate the last few pieces... that is right , yours truly!

I liked that it wasn't too sweet, and I found the texture to be so much better than those squishy box mix cakes.  It doesn't need a frosting, I found it was fantastic with a dusting of powdered sugar and a little cinnamon on top.  I'm going to let this sit overnight and have a piece or two tomorrow.  It'll be perfect with a cup of tea.",

A few times when I wanted something extra I added some cream cheese frosting on top. That was absolutely delicious as well! I make this cake at least once a week in my house. Everyone loves it.
