So here's what we did: added vegetable such as baby corn, bell peppers and ccarrots, added 2 extra spoons of soy sauce and on top of all this we did a little less fish sauce. Bon appetit. P.s If ur not to strickt on calories you can always at a tea spoon of cream which gives it that extra bit of texture.",

I used 2 Serrano Chilies. For the sauce I would add minced garlic and about 1 T. toasted sesame oil. For the stir fry I used untoasted sesame oil but I think I would use peanut oil next time. This would definitely benefit from the addition of some vegetables. Thanks for an inspiring recipe.",
