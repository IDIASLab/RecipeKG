I doubled it, split the sugar between half white and half brown and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon (next time I will take that down to 1/4 teaspoon).  I cooked this for almost 20 minutes.  This was the best cranberry sauce I have ever had!  I used to just resort to canned because I never seemed to be able to make a \"good\" cranberry sauce.  Toni, thank you for sharing this recipe, it was another huge hit on our Thanksgiving table this past weekend.  (We had to celebrate early this year.)",

This was so easy to make...and SO DELICIOUS!   And yes,cranberries do pop when boiled, so put the splatter guard on and let the kids listen.  I let them cook longer than 10 minutes just so it would get a little thicker, but after it is cooled it does thicken up more.  While they were boiling I gave them a good mash or two with my potato masher and the consistency was perfect.  Thank you Toni!",

First, use half cup of white sugar and half cup of brown sugar. Second, add a few pinches of cinnamon to your desired taste. Other than those couple of things, make it as directed. It really couldn't be easier or any more delicious! Trust me, you will never go back to the canned junk again!!! ",

As most of the reviewers pointed out, this was runny, but the flavor was great and the color was beautiful.  Adding a touch of grand marnier is ingenious. If you want a more gelled sauce, simply cut the OJ to 1/2 cup!  Once they start popping mash them with the back of a spoon.  This will gel in just a few hours in the fridge.  As it is, it is more of a delicious cranberry preserve - very spreadable for sandwiches!",
