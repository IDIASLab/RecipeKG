However, it has the appearance of a chocolate crinkle with the cracked powdered sugar making it attractive enough for a cookie tray. I made 1/2 recipe, and It made 20 cookies using a cookie scoop. I gently shaped them, but left them in a mound shape, and placed on a parchment paper lined sheet. Even though I coated them well with powdered sugar I had about half of it leftover. Mine took 16-17 minutes to bake.",

I made these, waited until the next day to taste them because of what the submitter said about the taste getting stronger the next day.  I didn't think they really tasted at all.  I stuck them away in a cupboard and promptly forgot them.  I found them this morning--eleven days later!  And guess what?!?  I LOVE them!  Yes, they are getting old, but the edges are wonderfully crunchy, and the middle is still just creamy soft.  And the taste is very pronounced.  Yummy with my coffee this morning!  Now I'll put them in my freezer to preserve them for the future coffees!  Thanks, Noelle!",

When I showed up at a pot luck I was rushed by people who love my baking and are always looking for something new from me...unfortunately everyone seemed very dissapointed. I asked my friend to be brutally honest and she told me not to make them again-that everything else I make is much better. I'm going to take her advice.",
