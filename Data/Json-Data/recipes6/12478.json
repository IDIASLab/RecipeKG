Used 1/2 tsp orange extract in place of the zest; had only 1/2 C pistachios, so I added slivered almonds too. These will be a PERMANENT addition to my files!",

Not only are these better than store-bought ones (which always tend to be a little harder than I like) they're also a lot cheaper too! This is an absolutely delightful snack that I will keep as a staple in my kitchen. The only difficulty I encounter was cutting the log since the center part tend to crumble & break (even with a very sharp knife); I also went ahead & spread some melted chocolate on the flat side of the biscotti to give it more of a flavor. These are definitely keepers!",

Some notes: Unlike other biscotti recipes I've made this dough did not have a tendency to crack in the oven or crumble when slicing (I always use a serrated knife) - a big reason why this will become a staple baked good for our house. Substitutions: splenda for white sugar and used orange-essence cranberries to pick up the flavor of the zest. Also suggested baking time was a bit long for my oven - did 27 minutes for first bake and only 10 for second. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!",

To make a direct comparison I used the same amount of craisins (3/4 cup) and pistachios (3/4 cup) in each recipe. I also eliminated any flavorings other than almond and vanilla (ie: omitted orange flavoring). Honestly there was little difference between the oil and the butter. The Spring Biscotti with the butter was a little crunchier and a little easier to work with/cut. The Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti with the oil stuck to the parchment paper a little and was a little more delicate to cut without crumbling. However the end result was a little softer than the spring biscotti. Either recipe is 5 star. I can't decide which one I will make again as they were so similar but I don't think I can go wrong!",
