Inspired by a Thai restaurant in Renton, WA called Sing Tong Thai, I decided to make my own version in the Instant Pot&reg;, where I know I can get fast and quality results. This recipe is fairly simple, and with the right ingredients, it's a dish that won't disappoint. Serve over a bed of garlic mashed potatoes or rice!",

I don't have an instant pot, so I made it in my Dutch oven and simmered for 3 hours.  The meat fell off the bone and was perfect!  The flavors melded together beautifully.  I will definitely make it again! I think there was enough sauce for more meat -- I'll probably try it with 3-4 lbs. of short ribs next time.",
