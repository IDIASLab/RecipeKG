Only modification to the ingredients was rubbing the roast prior to cooking with dried sage, which gave it an excellent aroma and added to the taste. While the cooking time of 6 hours on low was certainly adequate to cook the roast to the required internal temperature,  juices from the roast turned the sweet potato cubes somewhat mushy. The roast itself, while done, was dry and we had to make pork gravy to make it easier to eat.  I would suggest that the recipe be modified to use slightly larger than bite-size pieces of sweet potato to avoid the mushy consistency.",
