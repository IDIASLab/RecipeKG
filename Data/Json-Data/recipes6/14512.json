I tried this recipe for Valentines day for him as a surprise. He thought he was in heaven. Now I had never seen Fudge Pie before and was really surprised to find out that the center is supposed to be gooey. I baked mine 30 minutes and was starting to panic when it was still so runny but he assured me this is what it is supposed to look like. I didn't care for it thinking it tasted a little like an undercooked brownie but he and my daughter thought it was great. Maybe mine wasn't very good because by the time I got to eat it my piece was cold. I used the chips and had the whole thing in the oven in just minutes. I will make this again of course because my husband loves it so much.",
