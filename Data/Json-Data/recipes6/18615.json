My dough was too sticky for rolling into balls so I used two soup spoons and dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet - then used the glass dipped in sugar to flatten. I had substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco instead of lard...the butter probably caused the stickiness. I also made a light lemon frosting and my family LOVES THEM! Next time I will try all crisco and see if they are less sticky. You could easily cut this recipe in half and still have plenty of cookies.",

But I'm not sure if I'd make them okay without tweaks. I've worked with bakers ammonia and I know it has a strong flavor and smell. The dough came out too sticky to work with. So I ended up adding another cup of flour. There is a lot of sugar but oddly enough the cookie isn't really sweet tasting. The lemon flavor doesn't hit you until after you swallow the cookie. I'm not sure why but it's more of an after taste. In terms of texture this is why I love bakers ammonia. It makes cookies light and fluffy. I might consider trying it with a nuttier extract like almond. Or try a different method for the lemon flavor. I made these with a huge lemon cookie craving.",

The dough was very sticky so I couldn't flatten them and the result was a cookie that is a little firm around the edges but very cakey in the middle. I used 1/2 t of Fiori di Sicilia and 1/2 t of almond. The flavor is awesome! But the smell of ammonia is lingering - I wonder if the amount is supposed to be in teaspoons rather than tablespoons. That seemed like a lot. Or maybe I didn't bake them quite long enough. I put most of the batter in the fridge so maybe after they ripen a little they'll be easier to scoop and flatten and I'll try cooking them a little longer to hopefully get the crisper texture I thought I was going to get with these. In any case a good recipe but it didn't give me as much guidance as I'd hoped. I think I can make something really delicious with it though so thank you!",
