This is the most comprehensive and well-written recipe I've been able to find (i.e. not assuming that you grew up making it and just needed a refresher).  I have a few suggestions to make this easier for folks trying it - 1.) Be prepared the batter is THICK! I just used the bottom of the springform pan and spread the batter onto it - it was a lot easier and no burns taking the thing apart to quickly get the layer onto the cooling rack.  The sides are not needed to keep the batter in and just got in the way.  2.) this made a tad too much caramel and people were peeling it off and setting it aside because it was too much to crunch through - it ended up being the thickness of brittle.  I'll reduce by half next time so that it's more of a glaze.\r\n\r\nThanks, Kevin!  I owe you one!",

Two tips: (1) Instead of measuring batter layers as 1 1/3 cups each separate the batter into 7 equal amounts to avoid problems with varying batter volume. I had trouble getting 7 layers out of the batter - only got 4 and a bit 1 1/3 cup each as per the recipe. I used organic free-range eggs (denser so less volume) which may have been the problem. (2) Make sure you pour the melted sugar over a perfectly level layer or else it will just run down from it. This was a fairly annoying way for me to discover that the countertop is not quite level:-D",

The chocolate buttercream frosting might seem too rich but trust me it goes really well with the mild flavor of the cake. I'd recomend chilling the whole thing before serving and storing in the refrigerator (the frosting held up and tasted better cool/cold). I'd also recommened working on making the frosting and caramel toping while you bake the cake layers because this recipe takes quite a bit of time. Can't wait for an excuse to make this again;)",
