The only thing I did different was added 2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup chocolate chips but everything else was the same. And I finely chopped the prunes (to stop them sticking in teeth like one reviewer said happened) like I would herbs. This is a deceptive recipe cause you see prune and think 'uh no' but you CANNOT taste the prunes and have passed the kid and hubby test! FABULOUS! I also doubled the recipe and got 22 muffins.
