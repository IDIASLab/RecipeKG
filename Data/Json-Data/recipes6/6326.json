I recently purchased an Emeril Lagasse power air fryer, and generally speaking have found it lacking. Every time I followed one of their protein recipes, I found the protein to be undercooked and rubbery. That did not happen w this recipe. That being said I did make some adjustments. I lengthened the cooking time to 25 minutes. 15 mins side one and 10 mins for side two. Regarding the croutons I felt that a bit labor intensive so instead I used panko bread crumbs combined w a 1/4c of Parmesan and 1tsp of garlic powder. And I only needed one egg to coat 4 chops. The time may just be my Emeril air fryer but it worked perfectly. It also defaults to 400* for air fry setting so I left it at that. But the basics of this are great, and I will definitely do it again!",
