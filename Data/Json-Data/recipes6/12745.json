I ran out of butter so I used a 1/2 c of shortening and a 1/2 c butter I added 1/2 t of butter pecan extract along with the vanilla and I somehow didn't have any semisweet chocolate chips in the house (a travesty I know) so I ended up only using milk chocolate white chocolate and dark chocolate chunks in addition to the toasted pecans and toffee bits. There was so much stuff in the batter that I thought an ice cream scoop would suffice to scoop them out and they turned out like big coffee shop cookies. Pretty tasty but nothing way out of this world.",

Instead of using vanilla extract I used Vanilla Butter Nut flavoring by McCormick (much richer taste). I also didn't use bittersweet chunks but used semisweet chunks. I also tend to be pretty heavy handed on the toffee chips. Additionally I used walnuts and pecans. This is a great recipe!!",

I substituted the following: 1 tsp. butter nut flavoring and 1 tsp. vanilla (instead of 2 tsp. vanilla) semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chunks add 1/2 c. toasted walnuts use a whole bag of toffee bits and add 1 c. toasted coconut. I also used Scharfenberger and El Rey chocolate for the chunks and Ghiradelli for the chips. Next time I'm going to try adding macadamia nuts!",
