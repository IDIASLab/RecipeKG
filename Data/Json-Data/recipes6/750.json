I marinated boneless chicken thighs in bottled teriyaki (overnight), then grilled them and hit them with the sauce the last couple of minutes and passed the sauce at the table, everyone loved it. One suggestion - you really do not need to make a slurry with the cornstarch/water and add it in. Just stir in the cornstarch with everything else before you put it on the heat and it comes out fine.",

I lived in Florida for a couple years and was absolutely addicted to Tropical Smoothie's Korean BBQ Steak Tacos; I moved back North and there aren't any Tropical Smoothies around. This recipe makes for a perfect recreation of those addictive tacos. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, but otherwise completely followed this recipe to a T. Perfect balance of salty, sweet, and acidic.\n\nI recommend using this to marinade thin strips of beef, then combining that with cucumbers, kale, shredded carrots, and scallions in a flour taco shell.

I like oriental and this marinade/sauce was very good...the end didn't look like the picture as mine was thicker (too much corn starch maybe?) was pretty sweet and salty (I added more vinegar to cut down the sweetness and next time will use low-sodium soy sauce). One tbsp of Sriracha was just right as I like heat maybe next time add a tad of chili-garlic paste to up the ante. Marinaded sliced pork sausage and veggies skewered them and grilled the works....was quite tasty. I based the kabobs as they grilled and warmed a small bowl of marinade as a dipping sauce. Doing all of this the flavor wasn't overpowering. Next time I'll make the adjustments as mentioned above. If you enjoy oriental food try this sauce... a nice base to venture on to be creative.",

When poured over some stir-fried some veggies (onion celery mushroom broccoli) it liquefied more and all was great over rice.
