I didn't have the whipping cream for the filling so I sprinkled instant coffee granules in cool whip and used that. I went ahead and used 5 eggs instead of 3. I have another recipe that I used along side this one and it called for 5 eggs. I loved the outcome. It was so yummy though time consuming but a lot cheaper than buying one from a bakery (even though their not available this time of year). Thanks for sharing.",
