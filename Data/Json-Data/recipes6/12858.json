The only thing I do different is use two 1/4\" dowell rods when rolling out the dough to make sure each cookie is the same height and bake evenly.",

We rolled the next ones a little thicker about 1/4 inch and they were much easier to work with. Flavor was so-so just a sugar cookie. A little dense heavier texture than what I prefer. This is a nice sturdy cookie perfect for little hands to decorate.",

I had placed it in the refrigerator in the morning and this was evening. I didn't want to add any more flour because I didn't want a dry bland cookie. What I did was get out my cookie scoop and roll the scoop of dough in coarse sugar then flatten. Because I was now off track and the dough was thicker I lowered the temperature to 375degrees and baked for 10 minutes to be sure the center was done. The resulting cookie was delicious. I'm sorry this recipe did not work for me but the end result was GOOD! Thank you Patty Morris for sharing!",
