Also did 3/4 cup of cocoa because I like it chocolately!  And, lastly, I used 1/2 tsp salt and will use a bit more next time around.  It is pretty hard to toothpick-test something with chocolate chips because the toothpick can come out wet even if the batter is done, so I just recommend that you cook for 25 minutes and it should come out as perfect as mine did!  Great recipe -- thanks so much!",

I also took the advice of SukeyNY and used the following: 1.5 cups of milk 3 tbsp of oil 3/4 cup of cocoa and 1/2 tsp salt. Also we made a mistake when purchasing the ingredients and got chopped almonds instead of whole ones so we used a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts 1/3 cup of chopped almonds in addition to the chocolate chips. The muffins tasted wonderful anyway and richer besides. We also forgot to sprinkle the sugar before baking but reading the other reviews I guess that's just as well. With all the extras this recipe can yield at LEAST 16 muffins. We made 12 anyway by filling the muffin cups to the top so they were HUGE and lopsided but very moist. I hope this helped!",

                "reviewBody": "Good overall flavor. First this made 20 regular sized muffins. Also many reviewers stated that their chocolate chips sank to bottom of muffin; to resolve this issue dust chocolat chips with 1T flour. For those who think this is a dry muffin check your cocoa. If it's dark or dutch cocoa you should add extra dairy fat (think sour cream) since chocolate especially dark and dutch will absorb the fat content in a recipe and dry it out (also the milk should not be skim or low fat). Also if you omit the nuts this too will dry out the recipe as nuts add / help maintain moisture. That being said I used 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1 T oil plus 1T applesauce. Since I use a cocoa which is half semi-sweet / half dutch I added 2 t sour cream (double that if your cocoa is not a combo). My milk was 2% but whole milk would've been a better option. Also do not overcook. I baked 20 minutes and removed IMMEDIATELY from pan to help end residual baking. My muffins were chocolately and moist. The family really enjoyed. Better than store bought. P.S. For high altitude I reduced the baking powder by 1/2 t; this helps with over rising which leads to a deflated end product.",

I followed most ingredients listed however made the following modifications: 3/4 tsp salt 1 1/2 cup (fat free) milk 2 eggs 3 tbsp canola oil pecans (no walnuts or almonds on hand). I think I made a mistake in using fat free milk and I think some butter and maybe even applesauce should be in there somewhere. I will re-make and update my review in the future.",
