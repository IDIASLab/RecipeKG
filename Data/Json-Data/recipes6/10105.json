This recipe is easily adjusted to ones personal taste. Fresno or Serrano chilis can be used if Jalapenos are unavailable. If you can't handle 'HOT' food simply decrease the amount of jalapenos or use an Anaheim or Poblano chili instead.  If you're a garlic lover as I am, use a few more cloves of garlic.  If you've never handled fresh chilies before, be careful.  You can easily spread the oils from your hands to your face.  If you're sensitive, try gloves.",

You really can't go wrong making Pico de Gallo its simple and flavorful even if you omit a few ingredients. I didn't use Roma tomatoes I find them to be a little too soggy for my taste so I used 1 large firm Beefsteak Tomato. I love Red Onion but I didn't have one on hand so I opted to use a little more than half of a large White Onion instead. I used as much Cilantro as I wanted because 3 tablespoons hardly seems enough. I like heat so I used a 1/2 of a Jalapeno, if you don't have a fresh pepper on hand just use the ones that come in a jar or can it will work fine. Do not omit the fresh garlic it adds to the flavor but the garlic powder isn't really necessary in my opinion and neither is the Cumin. Salt and Pepper to taste is definitely a must I used fresh cracked pepper. However you decide to prepare it you definitely need to add Lime Juice I used the juice of 2 little Limes, it really helps to bring out all the flavors and keep your Pico de Gallo fresh. I paired it with some Blue Corn Tortilla chips and the leftovers if there are any ha ha will go nicely atop of my butter herbed Tilapia fish Fillets for tomorrow's dinner.",
