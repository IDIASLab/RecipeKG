Here are a few hints that will make your experience better, addressing previous concerns with consistency and burning.  I used my trusty Nutribullet to pulverize the dry ingredients first, then dump into a mixing bowl or 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup.  Add the wet ingredients to the same Nutribullet container and blend until completely liquified.  It should be very runny.  If it seems thick, add a couple tablespoons water and blend some more.  Pour the wet into the dry and mix with a spoon.  Your frying surface should be at a medium-low temp, sprayed with cooking spray.  I pour mine by 1/4 cup measure onto my nonstick fry pan.  Cooking these pancakes low/slow is key to success!  I've made them many times and after they cool, for the ones I'm saving for later, I layer in sealable containers separated by wax paper.  Keep 'em in the fridge and reheat. Yummy with fresh berries, sliced banana and real maple syrup!",

As they are, they just have a hint of sweetness. Also, these are not as fluffy as the usual pancakes, but they are super moist and flavorful. I did not use the protein powder. I topped mine w/ butter, sliced bananas and maple syrup~YUM! I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I had my pan on medium heat but found that the batter was soft so the outside would start burning before it had cooked enough to be able to flip them.

It is a great way to use my Tera's Whey bourbon vanilla protein powder which I don't care for as a drink.  I quadrupled the recipe so I could freeze some, and I drained the cottage cheese in a sieve for an hour to remove some excess liquid.  I still thought the batter was very thin, but it cooked up nicely.  Cooked six 1/4 cup sized pancakes on an electric griddle at 300 degrees, 3 minutes per side.",
