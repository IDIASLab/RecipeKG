I subsitituted the canned kernel corn with excellent just-picked fresh sweet corn scraped from the cob. About 1 1/2 to 2 c of fresh kerne1s (for me 3 large ears of corn) should replace the 15 oz. can. Why use canned at the height of corn season? I also threw the scraped cobs into the pot during Step 2 (after adding cream and 1/2 & 1/2). Infused it nicely with an intense corn taste. I wimped on the poblano - used a small one. I'll go bigger next time. Poblanos do get spicier the longer they linger however. Due to the use of roux as a thickener I think I may cut out some if not all of the cream next time and try whole milk just to prolong my life span a little longer and see if it tastes close to the same. This was a big hit with everyone. Cream 1/2 & 1/2 shrimp....what's not to love?",
