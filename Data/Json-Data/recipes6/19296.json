At first I thought the dough was a little too thick/dry but I kept stirring it and did not add any liquid. I dropped the dough by spoonfulls into the deep fryer and they turned out just right!! My husband even thought they were really good. This recipe is right on I got exactly 11 beautiful fritters and didn't change a thing. Thanks I'm sure I'll make these again.",
