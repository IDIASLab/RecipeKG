I ended up leaving out the brown sugar and even though I had the cornstarch slurry mixed up and ready to go I decided it was unnecessary as there really wasn't much liquid to thicken. The flavors aren't quite there on their own but that's ok because it was totally condiment-ready. I topped mine with a little sriracha and soy sauce and my husband topped his with sriracha and sweet chili sauce. You could absolutely use whatever kind of veggie you have on hand in this one.",
