This year I want to add that I use apple juice with good results instead of cider. I have always added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. allspice for richer flavor. If you use orchard apples they tend to be juicier so I add a few extra apples to make it pulpier. Jonathan apples work well with this recipe. I also use a small hand held blender to break up the chunks but if you prefer chunkier leave it alone. In reference to the other reviewer who noted how thin this apple butter seems. It does simmer and reduce down but will still appear somewhat apple-saucy while it is hot. As this apple butter cools overnight it does thicken and set on toast nicely. Still a recipe I grab each September to fix and freeze for the winter months. My kids ask for this every year.",

Also not 5 stars because it would have been very bland except I used the spice measurements that the other review recommended. Once those spices were added the flavor is great. Regardless of how thick it is I either have the BEST applesauce I've ever tasted or tasty (but runny) apple butter. Thanks for sharing and getting me started on something great!",

I only used 1 cup of apple juice 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar. I put 1/2 tsp. Vietnamese cinnamon (Penzeys) This apple butter is to die for! I cooked it for 8 hours total high the first few to get it going then low. The name should be apple butter \"carameled\"! It is the best apple butter I have ever had. great recipe! I will be making this every year. Thank you for sharing.:)",

After reading other reviews of this recipe I decided to add 2 tsp. cinnamon 1 tsp. allspice and 2 c. extra apple slices and it turned out beautifully. Everything else was spot on! I used my Vitamix to process it after simmering for the first 10 min and then cooked it for exactly 2 hours. The butter was completely set up as I hoped it would be after letting it cool in containers with lids off and transferring to the refridgerator soon thereafter.
