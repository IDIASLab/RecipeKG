I did however add two more cups of flour to the dough and then it seemed to be just right. Additionally the receipe does not explain how to rollout the individual balls which should be almost paper thin - it would be helpful to know this. The thinner the rolled out dough is the better it is for frying. Also the deeper the fryer the better the bunuelos turn out. If you do not use a deep fryer the edges will brown slighter darker than the rest of the cookie which does not look good for presentation.",

It should be noted that this recipe is a short cut of the authentic bu nuelo so if this is to much work you can only imagine the real thing. To get a more authentic result with this recipe roll out the dough as thin as possible while still maintaining enough workability to handle the dough without tearing/puncturing it. Also you can either incorporate a hint to anise to the dough itself or you can substitute the sugar/cinnamon topping for a melted anise and piloncillo (block of unrefined brown sugar)syrup.",
