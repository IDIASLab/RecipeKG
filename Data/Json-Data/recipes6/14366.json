The big danger is the filling can be too liquid. Stew them with only just enough water to keep the bottom of the pot from burning. Just a TINY bit! And you still may need to drain out some water after stewing. I increased the sugar in the fig filling to about a 1/2 cup also which turned out to be a good idea. I took my pie along to a party and it was very well received. I'll definitely give it another go.",
