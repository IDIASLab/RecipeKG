I came close, but the Jiffy mix fools you: wet it looks like a thin layer, but cooked it puffs a LOT,  so it blends heartily with the meat layer. I still had a good layering going on when served, and it tasted delicious. Easy, worth-it recipe. Even great the next day.",

First, we have no Jiffy cornmeal mix up here so I made a double cornbread recipe and split it. No Poblano's either so I chopped up a red and a green bell pepper. I didn't thaw my corn.  The spice amounts I guessed at and while I was a little light on the salt, it was fine. I subbed in just a very little bit of red pepper flakes instead of the chipotle powder because we like just a wee bit of heat. I upped it a bit more by using a pre-mixed bag of shredded cheddar, jack and colby cheese with hanbanero and jalapeno peppers. I used maybe a 1/2 cup of cheese. The end result was and is wonderfully edible. A dish that will go in the rotation!",

I also left out the poblano peppers (didn't have any).  It turned out really great.  I baked for 40 minutes at 400 since that was what my corn bread recipe called for. It was perfect.",

Reading over this, I bought cornbread mix...is that different than corn muffin mix?  It wasn't a hit with the meat mixture.  Only two out of 6 enjoyed it and had seconds.  I threw some ghost pepper salsa on it to spice it up which was good.  We should have used more cheese too.",
