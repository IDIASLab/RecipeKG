I omitted the milk altogether and used 2 cups of fresh cherries that I tossed with a couple of Tbsp. of sugar which produced their own juice. I creamed 1/2 cup of butter with 3/4 cup of white sugar and then added the eggs one at a time. I only used 1 & 3/4 cup of flour and instead of 2 tsp. of baking powder I used 1 tsp. and added a tsp. of baking soda. I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract. I left out the nuts as well. I poured the batter into six Texas sized muffins tins lined with paper topped them with a generous amount of turbinado sugar and baked them at 400 for about 25 minutes. With those changes it's now a 4 star recipe!",
