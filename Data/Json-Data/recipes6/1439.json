These were super simple to make and the house smelled soooo good while these were baking. I always get baked beans from a local market that we always considered 'the best' baked beans, but these surpass those, and are waaaaay cheaper to make than those ones are to buy, so that's a bonus. I did measure all of the liquid ingredients and brown sugar, but I did eyeball the onions and red pepper, and I'm sure I used more of those than the recipe called for. If I could give these beans more stars, I would...these are wonderful~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Why cook them in oil when you have all of that flavorful bacon grease to cook them in?",

They just weren't as tender as we would have liked. Could still eat the beans but we chewed awhile.
