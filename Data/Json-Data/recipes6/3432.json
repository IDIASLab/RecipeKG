I used mixed nuts rather than just peanuts. I omitted the pumpkin seeds thanks to a previous review. And I threw in a handful of gluten-free pretzels to give it the authentic Chex mix flavor. Given the nuts (and pretzels) I recommend not adding any additional salt. It took longer to bake than stated but it needs to be stirred occasionally so you will be able to judge when it is done.",
