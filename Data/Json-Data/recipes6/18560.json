I froze the rest and they were eaten in school lunches and for quick on-the-go breakfasts. You can play around with this recipe to suit your whims. Once I added finely chopped apples and cinnamon. Another time I added ground flax seed. I think I like it with the addition of cinnamon. I like the fact that it has no oil but it still has a nice texture and they turn out moist and just yummy. So play around with it if you want or just enjoy it as is.",

I did add cinnamon because it is a favorite spice in this household but I might try without next time. I think for the texture it is important to go quickly from mixing the wet & dry right into the oven - the leavening acts quickly and you want them to be fluffy! I will note - I had enough batter for more than 12 muffins using a bare pan (no liners) but only one pan so I can't tell exactly how many it could have made. Oh one more thing (sorry so long!) I really enjoyed splitting a muffin open and putting a bit of peanut butter on it - match that with fruit for a great light meal!",
