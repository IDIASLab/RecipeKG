They are perfectly flaky and light with a hint of sweetness and that pumpkin-spice flavor comes through wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of the glaze) and I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing worthy of noting is that you will get a better flake with any scone if you use really cold butter--and that's what I did and recommend doing for this recipe as well. The dough is a touch sticky to work with but not unmanageable--so keep your work surface lightly floured while kneading it. As for the glaze I ended up adding an additional tbsp of molasses and used half & half in place of milk (and I ended up using about 3 tbsps total of that). I also upped the cinnamon added a pinch of salt and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Let that all come to a boil then cooled as directed. I really enjoy the spicy-molasses-y flavor the glaze provides--and it pairs perfectly with the pumpkin flavored scones. I will definitely be making these again in the future! Thank you so much for the recipe!",
