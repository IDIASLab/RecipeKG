I was concerned with the little amount of sugar at first but when measuring I didn't completely level it so it added a little extra to my recipe. I thought they were going to be more like a chocolate pecan sandie cookie. But they tasted just like a \"chocolate version of a snowball cookie.\" I used a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop and put the cookies on parchment instead of a sprayed pan. I got 32 baked cookies from the recipe. When cool I did coat them with the powdered sugar but it took about twice as much as instructed. Thanks again MARBALET for another simple to follow and good recipe. As they remind me of snowballs I may make these as a Christmas cookie this year.",
