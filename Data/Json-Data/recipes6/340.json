                "reviewBody": "it was definitely a yummy and juicy meatloaf and I would make it again.  I would make it with minced garlic next time, as other reviewers suggested.  It actually stayed together in loaf form, and I didn't expect that!  The main reason I give it only 3 stars is that it could have been more flavorful (although DOUBLE the sauce - it's delish!) but mostly because the recipe calls for sliced mushrooms.  When I mixed the meat mixture together I really felt like I should chop the mushrooms a little more.  But I kept to the recipe (I made it exactly as written.)  The sliced mushrooms were a little too big and looked weird and made the loaf fall apart more than it would have - again - it DID stay together better than I expected, but had the mushrooms been chopped, it would have been MUCH better, texture-wise.  I'd probably recommend 1/2 inch dice for the mushrooms or even, maybe I'll throw 'em in the food processor to get a nice even rough chop.  You could even throw in fresh onion and garlic too (first, before mushrooms) to get a nice homogenous mix before adding to the eggs, milk, breadcrumbs....I'll do that next time.",

Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this (which is a HUGE plus considering my husband isn't a meatloaf fan, let alone a GLAZED meatloaf fan!). My neighbor and I both like to cook and often share recipes with each other. She recently asked if I had a recommendation for a slow cooked meatloaf. I didn't (the last slow cooker meatloaf I attempted was not to my liking), so she did a search on here and found this recipe. She and her husband liked this a lot, so of course I had to try this out for myself. :) Other than omitting the mushrooms altogether (we hate them) and adding a t of garlic powder, I made no significant changes. I used ground chuck to ensure my meatloaf would remain moist (I was afraid lean sirloin would produce a dry meatloaf and ground round would be too greasy). My slow cooker has a thermometer / probe setting, so I used that to cook my meatloaf (FYI, it took about 4 hours to reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F). NOTE: Once cooked, I carefully removed my meatloaf, drained the grease, added it BACK to the slow cooker and proceeded as directed. Homemade mashed potatoes, green beans and crescent rolls perfectly complemented our \"homey\" meal. Thanks SO much for sharing this easy and delicious meatloaf recipe, NightHawk! I wasn't expecting much, but you sure made a believer out of me. :-)",
