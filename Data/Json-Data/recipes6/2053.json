        "description": "I made this rub for my daughters 14th birthday, which is why I called it BBQ dry rub No.14. It gives pork a nice sweet flavor that goes well with all the other spices. This rub has a mild flavor and will not burn sensitive pallets. The light brown sugar gives a gentle sweetness to offset the other spices and is great on ribs or pork shoulder. For ribs sprinkle salt and pepper and refrigerate overnight. Larger cuts of meat can use more. For heat lovers, add 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (or any amount you like).",

I just want to add that  prior to rubbing the spices on,  I use a very sharp knife and remove as much of the membrane on the back of the ribs as possible.  I also cut a slit between every 2 bones and get the rub inside there too.  I smoke them for 2-3 hours on a wood fired grill.  Then I put them into the oven for 3-4 hours on 250.  I like to do them a day ahead of time so there is no rush on the party day.",
