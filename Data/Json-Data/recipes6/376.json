I would never try to set this directly on the grill over the can. Just too tippy for that. Put the can on an aluminum wrapped broiler pan so there is some stability and you don't have a chance of boiling hot ingredients tipping over on you. This took almost 90 minutes to cook through for me but it would depend on the temp of your grill. Thanks for sharing!",

Save the bones and trimmings 3 of these make a gallon of an amazing bone broth. I use the Thai sun peppers (small ones often used in pad Thai) and believe youngs double chocolate stout is the best. 2 other stouts and one porter were tried. In my grill or oven at 450 ( When out of charcoal) this takes 50 -55 minutes to hit 165f. It has been a big hit with picky grandkids who \"don't like spices\" I told them it was mostly sugar and chocolate there is just enough sweetness to satisfy them",
