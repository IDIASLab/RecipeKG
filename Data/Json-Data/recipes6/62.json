They came back with a huge bag of \"seconds\" which were just slightly bruised or just not pretty enough to sell. I tell you I had at least 40-50 apples of quite a few varieties and there was nothing wrong with them....AND the best part is that is was only 10 for the bag! I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/4c and the cider to 3/4 c. I did jar and process the applesauce as I wanted to keep it in my pantry and gift it to others. Thank you for an awesome recipe as I have never used brown sugar and cider before in applesauce. Way better than white sugar and water. Thanks!",
