I used White Lily flour which made it a bit lighter than it would have been with AP flour. It's not a heavy chocolate taste but I liked it. For those who say it didn't have much chocolate flavor at all be sure you're using dutch processed cocoa - it's darker and has a deeper chocolate flavor. Overall it's good but I think it'd be a good companion of something else - whipped cream ice cream maybe raspberries. It just seems to need a little something.",
