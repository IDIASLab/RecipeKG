This is how he grew up eating avacados...so he considers them to be like a fruit rather than a vegetable. We didn't add the sugar or the other ingredients...only avacados and condensed milk. All I can say is \"don't knock it till ya try it!\" Thanks L.",

Our initial enthusiam diminished in direct proportion to the quantity consumed. Some ingredient (milk powder?) left a perceptible micro-crunchiness I could feel in my molars. Perhaps we would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't tried it solo. I really liked the creaminess of the avocado and appreciate the idea of adding it to other smoothies.",
