It was dry and bland...so like one of the reviewers suggested I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup low fat milk and then baked/microwaved til heated thru. Hubby thought it was good and it was one of those recipes that I would make again if I had the ingredients on hand and needed a meal in a hurry. It's not a company dish by any means but it is healthy comfort food with the rice & veggies and salmon... Thanks for sharing!",
