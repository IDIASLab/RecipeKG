Golden syrup is a thick amber-colored form of inverted sugar syrup made in the process of refining sugar cane juice into sugar or by treatment of a sugar solution with acid. It is used in a variety of baking recipes and desserts. It has an appearance and taste similar to honey and is often used as a substitute for people who cannot eat honey and those who choose not to (such as vegans). It can also be used as a substitute for corn syrup.",

Having lived in Norway for several years I will explain that the vanilla sugar (vaniljesukker)I found in the grocery store was in fact of a powdered sugar consistency. However it can be quite difficult to find the Scandinavia style of vanilla sugar in the United States. I have made the recipe using granulated sugar and adding vanilla as well as using powdered sugar and adding vanilla. Both ways have turned out just fine. In my estimation this recipe is very forgiving and highly adaptable. Thus I think it does not make too much difference which variation of vanilla sugar is used. Thank you.",

The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to refrigerate the dough before cooking (it was quite sticky and difficult to work with) and then to bake them as drop cookies. I made these at a time when I was desperate for cookies but had absolutely no sugar on hand but did have golden syrup although I suppose you could use honey or corn syrup or molasses if you didn't have golden syrup. These turned out much much better than expected. They did not taste the greatest straight out of the oven and looked quite flat but once they had cooled they had a lovey slightly crisp but chewy almost melt-in-your-mouth texture with a really nice buttery flavor.",
