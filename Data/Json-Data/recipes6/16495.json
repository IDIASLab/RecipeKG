It called for 2 cups of butter and I am wondering if it was meant to read 2 STICKS of butter. Also the eggs called for are not listed in the ingredients but at least I remembered it took 2. The consistency turned out very thickand solid not light and fluffy that's why I think the amount of butter called for is wrong. I knew there was something not quite right but I had waited until the last minute and thought maybe it was just me. The people at my Easter dinner tried one bite and went straight for the cake I baked instead.",
