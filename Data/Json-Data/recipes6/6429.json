Otherwise I did follow the recipe except for the high temperatures called for.  I roasted the potatoes at 450 rather than 500, and when I added the chicken I cut it back to 350.  This was delicious and filling and I will look forward to eating it again soon.  Thank you so much, krisgo!",

I know you said not to be afraid of the high temp, but I was lol. So I cooked it at 400 for the same amount of time you suggested and it turned out perfect. I also doubled the amount of sauce. I used half (the original amount that the recipe called for) to coat and cook the potatoes in. I didn't really have any left over to marinate the chicken in, so I made another batch for that. This turned out to be a perfect amount of sauce. It did come out a little on the bland side for our taste, so we ended up putting additional hot sauce on it after serving.  But overall it was a hit, and I think i'll be making it again!",

I combined 1/4c ranch, 2T homemade wing sauce, 1t each of garlic powder, onion powder, salt & tossed the potato cubes in it. In the bowl, there was very little left so I combined 1/4c ranch, 2T homemade wing sauce & 1/2t each of same spices. It wasn't until I had the potatoes in the oven that I realized I forgot the oil so I added it to the second batch of sauce. It wasn't necessary & diluted the flavor. After everyone :D was cooked, I added another 3T wing sauce & topped with 2T bacon. Better - could actually tell it was buffalo. I think with a couple Ts oil in the dish, that's all needed; none in the sauce. No cheese. I wasn't feelin' cheese with buffalo. Sum up: 'Not a casserole; more of a \"bake.\" I don't see making this again unless E requests it. Glad I made though... Update: Said \"guys\" finished it the next day. It seems I will be making it again - when I have leftover wing sauce. 'May make just tatoes for potato-lovin' girls.",
