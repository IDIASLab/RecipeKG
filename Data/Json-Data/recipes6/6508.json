                "reviewBody": "I really hate to do this but as written, these are not good. I'll start with the pickles themselves. Once you cut the spears into fry shape, it releases way too much liquid and they just keep releasing liquid so there isn't enough paper towels to soak it all up. End result, super soggy pickle fries. Next is the coating. Old bay is salty, pickles are salty, and then more salt is added. I should have known better but honestly thought a lot of it would get lost in the hot oil. Nope. Super salty. Another this is while I love fresh parsley and prefer it to dried, it doesn't stick to the breading. I was going to redo this recipe in hopes of giving it a better picture and review by leaving the spears whole and then omitting the salt. I decided against it though because people deserve to know exactly what they are getting into when they start a recipe. I do think this recipe has potential and loved the flavor the Old Bay brought but it definitely needs some tweaks.",
