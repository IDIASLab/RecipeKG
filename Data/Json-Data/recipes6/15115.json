I brought it all to a boil and then slow boiled for about 20 minutes, to thicken, stirring often.  I water bath canned in sealed jars for about 15 minutes.  I can really taste all three flavors in the jelly and it's not oversweet.  Fantastic on toast, ice cream, and I'm sure will be great with ham.",
