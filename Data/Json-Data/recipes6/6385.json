I think this needs a lot more hot sauce, but then, that could be personal taste. I put everything into my mini processor/chopper  that came with my immersion blender and ended up with a really smooth texture. I\u2019ve tried a lot of deviled egg recipes, and although this turned out OK with good flavor and  consistency, it seems I always head back to simple deviled eggs with few ingredients.  IMO this recipe has way too many ingredients, many of which simply are lost when you bite into the filled egg white.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, glad I tried it, but doubtful I\u2019ll make again.",
