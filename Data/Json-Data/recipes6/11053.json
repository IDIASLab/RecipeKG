I followed other reviewer's suggestions: substituting butter-flavor Crisco for butter; creaming with the sugar for over 2 minutes; and baking in a single 10-inch springform Bundt pan. It came out quite well on the first try.\r\n\r\nI also tried whipping the egg whites separately, but that made little difference, as this is a pretty solid, moderately dense cake, so I wouldn't bother with that in the future.\r\n\r\nThe flavor is such a pure, moderate chocolate cake that it would be perfect as a base for a wide range of desserts using added flavors. Vanilla whipped cream would be a great accompaniment. Unaccompanied, it's nice but a little too plain.\r\n\r\nCaution: grease the pan quite well, as the cake is clingy when hot and you don't want to tear it.",

It is a little crumbly, but I make it the day before and put it in the fridge.  This seams to change it into a very moist cake.  I consider this a good thing, because then I always have the cake ready ahead of time. It does stick in your pans terribly, so be sure to line your pans with baking paper (or parchment) and not just butter or butter and flour them.  This is a really delicious cake.  I would make something different for each birthday, but my husband and kids ask for this chocolate cake every time.  Now if they would only learn the recipe and make it on my birthday.....ha ha.",

If you are getting a dry cake from this recipe, I believe it could be a technical issue.  Insufficient creaming of the butter and sugar could cause the cake to be dry.  I allow at least 2 minutes of moderate-speed blending.  I also used butter-flavored Crisco (1c butter = 1c Crisco + 6t water), which can also make it moister.  You could also be overbaking, either by giving it too much time in the oven or by having an oven that's too hot.  If you enjoy baking, do yourself a favor and invest $6.00 in an oven thermometer.  You won't regret it!",

It was a very thick cake, but not too dense and went over very well. Not as chocolate as I would have hoped for tho but a nice alternative from scratch.",

This cake, being a butter cake, (meaning that the fat and sugar are creamed together to incorporate air), is light, tender and fluffy. Neither type is better than the other, it's either a matter of personal preference or what you want for a particular project. As a butter cake, this recipe is very good, and I know it wil improve by the following day. I halved the recipe, which yielded 12 cupcakes and one small loaf cake. Other than using freshly brewed coffee for the water, I followed the recipe as written and was quite satisfied with it. ",
