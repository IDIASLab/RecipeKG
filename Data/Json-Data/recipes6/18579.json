At first I thought there was too much cinammon, but after it baked and was all bubbly and the apple and cranberry juices mixed with the cinammon, it was wonderful!The topping was perfect--I was out of nuts, so omitted them--and it was still good. I wouldn't change a thing. By the way, the recipe doesn't specify whether or not to chop up the cranberries, don't---they would almost disappear if you did---they sort of \"explode\" as they bake, and make wonderful juice--and still contribute to the texture of the dish. Delicious!!!!",

I should've served it cold instead of reheating it before serving. I changed the amount of crisp, quadrupled it actually! Gotta love the crisp! I even baked it in a 9x13 dish since wanted more crisp than filling and, honestly, was out of dishes. This turned out to be a bit of a wrong turn. My insanity resulted in the filling just being a thin little layer at the bottom. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will bake it in a 9x9 or similar dish. Will I quadruple the crisp again? Heck yeah! I might even add more cranberries. They were great and just so few! Oh, and I threw in a handful of orange craisins, the kind you buy in a bag in the raisin area of the grocery store for a little bit of orange zesty juiciness. This recipe is a dream with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe. I'm hungry for some right now, but all leftovers were gone by the next day.",

Another reviewer said that she thought that the recipe called for too much cinnamon...but once she baked it she realized it was perfect. I agree as I was adding the cinnamon it seemed like a lot...but in the baking it adds a terrific flavor! I also doubled the amount of the topping which was perfect. One thing that I may do next time is add more quick oats...to make the topping crunchier! A This one is a winner!!",
