I'm a college student who's mother stocked the pantry so I had canned limas and corn which I used. I drained the limas but not the corn because the corn juice was sweeter and since I wasn't cooking the limas in water I figured I needed some more liquid. I also had no heavy cream so I used whole milk less than the half cup called for. I didn't have the thyme or the chives so for another flavor I sauteed some red bell pepper in the bacon fat when I was doing the onions. I was delicious all my college friends loved it.
