I cooked it for the time given but the top was a little over-done although the middle was just right so next time I placed a piece of baking parchment with a small hole in the centre loosely over the top of the cake for the first hour of cooking removing it for the last 30 minutes and this gave a much better result. This is a great cake and already a firm favourite.",
