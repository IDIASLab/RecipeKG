It isn't hard to make, just frying up the chicken takes time. How changed the recipe was I instead used about 1/3-1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/3-1/2 cup of honey, soy sauce, 3 tbls. of vinegar or water (one or the other not both makes sauce to thin)  and 1/2 tablespoon of chili garlic sauce (its an asian sauce that can be found in the ethnic food aisle at your grocery store). If you don't have or can't find the sauce then you could probably use red pepper flakes instead. I really do suggest that you put in some \"heat\" to the sauce it just makes it ten times better and you don't feel like your eating candy chicken. You don't need to add a lot of spice just a little for flavor. Hope this helps someone.",

After frying the wings I transfered them to a 350 oven to really crisp up added cornstarch to the sauce to make a thick glaze basted the wings turned them and turned the oven down to 250; basted the other side and let them finish for about 10 mins. You can baste them repeatedly depending on how much glaze you have left. The taste of the glaze is awesome (I added crushed garlic) and the crisp coating of the wings under it makes them even better. Great recipe.",

Sometimes I don't bother with the flour and egg and place meat into oven and pour sauce overtop and bake. I always make extra sauce for dipping with other meats throughout the week. It tastes great as a glaze on baked ham as well. It's definately cut back on the Chinese Take Out bills. Thanks for the recipe!!",
