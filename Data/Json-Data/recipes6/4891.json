Only changed a couple of things. I used canned diced tomatoes (it's not tomato season here right now) which probably doesn't really matter and made the whole process quicker. Also I processed the soup in my Cuisinart until it was nearly smooth and served it with a dollop of sour cream. That was the touch that made it awesome and we will be having it that way again. This is definitely a keeper!",
