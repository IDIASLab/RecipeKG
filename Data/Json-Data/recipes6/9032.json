                "reviewBody": "This recipe is good. The reason of my 4 stars is that it needs a flavor boosting agent. The cilantro alone won't do it. Now, without much tweaking all you can do is add one garlic clove minced and a bit of onion. If you don't have cilantro, fresh parsley will work. Now, the real tweak comes in the procedure: First, sautee the garlic and onion being careful they do not burn but are soft. Then, add the mushrooms to the mixture. Sprinkle salt and pepper and the herbs. Mushrooms absorb salt so be mindful. After the mushrooms are done, transfer them to a plate and proceed to cook the cabbage in batches. Add a bit of salt and pepper. Once it softens and looks a bit greener in color add the mushrooms on top and add the broth. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. You are done. One tip for working with mushrooms is to pat dry them after rinsing and before cooking. This will prevent mushy mushrooms that have too much water. I will definitely will make this recipe again with my tweak.",

I had a regular cabbage that needed used up, so I used that in place of the savoy. I also dissolved a 1/2 tsp of 'Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base' in a 1/2 cup of water for the broth, and I felt this added a ton of flavor to it. The dried cilantro was quite a nice touch too. I did find that my cabbage was cooked to my preferred doneness after about 12 minutes--so I removed lid after that, and cooked an additional 3 minutes just to evaporate some of the moisture. Overall, a really nice, easy, and quick side dish that I'll be definitely making again! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
