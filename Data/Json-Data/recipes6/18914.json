                "reviewBody": "12.21.19 First I followed this recipe to the letter. The cheesecake flavor is spot on however the texture is not. I left this cheesecake sit in the fridge overnight so it had plenty of time to firm up. I ran a knife around the inside and when I released it from the springform pan big chunks of the filling were stuck to the sides of the pan...not a pretty cheesecake! I used an offset spatula dipped in water to smooth out the sides so I could at least take a picture. This rose above the height of the pan so the top of the foil had a lot of the batter cooked on it. Not a major problem though because the sour cream topping covered it up. The texture is not firm like a cheesecake should be the sides of the cake are soft but when you get to the center it s like pudding. Basically it needs more than 40 minutes to cook quite a bit more time I think. Typically when I try a new recipe and it turns out like this I just move on. Rather than writing this recipe off I m going to try one more time cooking longer because it s really tasty and I think has potential.",
