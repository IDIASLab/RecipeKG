I would not call it fudgy - the flavor reminds me more of red velvet cake than of a traditional chocolate cake. I used Dr. Pepper and cut the amount of butter by half; otherwise made as written. (Don't use diet soda - the artificial sweetener is not heat stable!) I did not care for the topping though (which is more of a glaze not a frosting) - it was WAY too sweet. I made a 9x9 cake and 12 cupcakes; the cake got the topping and the cupcakes were frosted with a \"flour icing\" recipe which was much less sweet and complemented the cake better. All in all pretty good recipe.",

I used Saco powdered buttermilk as I only rarely use buttermilk. I just added a couple of tbp. in w/ the dry ingredients & added a 1/2 cup of water when I added the eggs. I didn't much care for the frosting until I had it on the cake & then it was superb. Other than using the Saco buttermilk blend, I made no changes to this recipe. It's a keeper as is!",

The cake was really good but the icing was really fudgy and even sweeter. I didn't have nuts so I proceeded without them. This reminded me of Texas Sheet cake. My husband called it brownie cake and had 2 pieces. I added just a pinch of salt to the icing as my butter was unsalted. I didn't have buttermilk so I used the sweet milk/vinegar method to make a substitute. All I had was a British malt vinegar but it worked and the flavor was not affected. I had to bake this just a few minutes longer as the center was still jiggly at 35 minutes. I will make this again it was really easy and tasty and was just as I remembered from my youth. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I didn't use walnuts used a cup less powdered sugar and poked holes in the cake for the frosting to run in. Moist! I used the new black cherry coke and I tasted a very subtle hint of it overall. It was a fun cake. Presentation isn't perfect because of the fragile moist nature but once you taste it....it's a sure keeper.",
