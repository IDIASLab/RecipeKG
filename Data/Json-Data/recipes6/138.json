However there are a couple things that were different than other pad Thai recipes and I would change them. For one putting the peanuts on top of the servings (with dried red pepper and green onion if desired) adds color. It's easy to get the noodles too soft between the soaking and the time in the sauce. Ten minutes is probably too long. But the truth is we ate it all and enjoyed it.",
