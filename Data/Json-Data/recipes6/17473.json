In addition to the 1 ounce of semi sweet chocolate I added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. I refrigerated about 4 hours & baked at 350 for 12 minutes. I also did not grease the pan and the cookies came off great. These turned out perfect! Great sweetness nice and chocolately chewy and moist yet crispy.",
