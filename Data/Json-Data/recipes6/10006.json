It also makes the most delicious topping for crepes! The touch of balsamic gives it a pop of acidity and a deeper flavor. Feel free to mash the berries with a fork or potato masher for a smoother consistency. Refrigerate for up to 1 week.",

I love balsamic vinegar and the flavor goes well with strawberry, however, next time I would reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon (maybe 1.5) as I found the flavor to slightly overwhelm the strawberries. That being said, if you let this reduce further and become quite thick, it would go so well on some brie or any appetizer where one would like savory and sweet.",
