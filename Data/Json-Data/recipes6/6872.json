I scaled the recipe back to just feed myself but I have to admit I didn't really measure all of the ingredients more eye-balled them to taste. I did use the dried dill but I wanna try them with my garden fresh dill next time. I think between the bacon drippings and the dill they did give the eggs a very slight smoky flavor and the mayo and 1/2 & 1/2 gave a wonderful texture. All of the ingredients really paired well together. This really hit the spot for me this morning! I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
