Rather than slicing I chopped the carrots and celery in bigger chunks so they won't disintegrate in the crockpot and also added 2 big potatoes in 1\" cubes. To make up for extra carrots and the potatoes which weren't in the original recipe I added 1 T soy sauce and additional 1 t worcestershire sauce and more black pepper. I also used only 1/4 of an onion cut in big 2 inch pieces so it wouldn't turn to mush. In the last half hour I added pearl onions. For spices I followed the recipe and then added sprinkles of cumin savory rosemary and parsley. 8-9 hours in the crockpot was just right for 2 lbs meat. It really was a hearty flavorful meal. P.S. My husband thought this dish was okay. He's not into large chunks of beef in a dish.",

Some I took from other reviews - I added soy sauce used beef broth from bouillon cubes instead of water and added cabbage. I also didn't have bay leaves on hand so those were not in the stew. I also found that the stew was too thin for my taste. So halfway through cooking I took part of the broth and thickened it as if I was making gravy until it reached a texture I preferred. The final result was great. I would definately make it again.",
