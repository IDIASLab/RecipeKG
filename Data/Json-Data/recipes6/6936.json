We used some peper jack this time with the cheddar cheeae...and broiling for 1 to 2 min at the end was worth it.",

Glad I did because i think it would have dried out otherwise.   It was pretty good way to use leftover bread and eggs from our chickens.  -Thanks\n* I thought I'ld add if you reheat this the next day in the toaster oven  it's even better -",
