Also, AND I HOPE IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE YOU READ THIS... the amount of sugar in this recipe is off. Previously, when I went to store it, it would crystallize really bad in my fridge over time. I'm an engineer, so I figured I'd check it out. It turns out, when the liquid in this recipe is hot it can hold 3 cups of sugar (supersaturated solution). When it cools to the temperature of your fridge (about 40 F), sugar begins to precipitate out of the mixture and crystallize. You can heat it back up and stir and stir and it will dissolve again, but I calculated and tested, and the recipe is actually 1 cup over the maximum amount of sugar allowable by chemistry. If you don't want to have to reheat it for so long to get rid of the sugar crystals, cut the recipe down to 2 c sugar. It's still plenty sweet and the consistency isn't effected. AWESOME recipe though!",

I added about 6 ounces and unsweetened baking chocolate, I thought after tasting it that it tasted like chocolate SAUCE not FUDGE, so that's why I added the extra chocolate.  I also added almost a teaspoon of salt.  It helped to cut down on the VERY sugary taste.  I did not have to put the mixture into a blender, it was prefectly smooth by just whisking it, it also keeps very well in the fridge and reheats perfectly.  oh I forgot to add, it DOES NOT taste like carmel, the people that say that MUST be using sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated milk.  Oh, and it was just a tad bit thin at first, then once it cooled it was perfect.",

I decided to give this one a try after just not finding one quite thick enough or creamy enough.  This was perfect.  The consistency was excellent. I have made it numerous times now.  I have upped the cocoa to almost 1/2 cup to prevent the caramel taste and give it a richer chocolate taste.  I have also (after reading some reviews) added in a handful of semisweet choc chips.  A tip to save on dishes and time is to use a hand blender while boiling on the stove instead of using a blender after cooking. I'm keeping this recipe and will be giving this out for Christmas gifts this year.",

Also, for the left-over sauce, it is not grainy and does not crystalize. Try it!",

My only caution would be if you have a blender that is made of plastic instead of glass and pouring in the hot liquid. I had a glass blender and had no problems. If you LOVE chocolate you need to try this one! This would be great with fruit or fondue. This is FANTASTIC just eating off the spoon when slightly cooled or even COLD the next day!!

I double the recipe and it almost makes 5 pints.  In a double batch I use 1.5 cups of the Cocoa, 1Tbs vanilla and boil for 9-10 minutes.  This gives a rich dark chocolate flavor.  If you like milk chocolate then use a little less.  Blending is the key as the cocoa will be grainy out of the pan.  Blend it for at least a few minutes or until it becomes think and strains your blender.  Also when reheating I use a measuring cup with water and put the hot fudge in the water or you can use a single serving in the microwave.  This keeps the hot fudge from crystalizing.",
