Here are my modifications:  Use your Kitchenaid stand mixer to mix all the ingredients for the butter-less basic dough, then attach the dough hook and knead, adding flour as necessary (about 6-7 minutes of kneading).  I did not use all the flour (I was short by about 1 cup as the dough was getting saturated and I did not want it to dry out or become tough).  Secondly, remove dough hook, remove dough from bowl, spray inside of bowl with non-stick cooking spray, place ball of dough back in sprayed bowl, and spray top of dough with non-stick cooking spray.  Third, cover entire stand mixer with a large plastic bag and allow to rise for about 45-60 minutes (or until dough basically is filling the whole bowl).  Those three steps right there take out all the work of kneading by hand.  I followed everything else to the letter except:  I made an apple filling by peeling 4 large granny smith apples and chopping into very small pieces, adding 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  I then placed the apple mixture on the stove on medium-high heat, added about 1/3 cup of flour, and allowed apple mixture to cook, stirring frequently, until the apples were soft but still held their shape (about 15-20 minutes of simmering).  I then took the apples off the stove and allowed them to sit until I was ready for them.  When I was ready to form the pastries, I took one of th",

I cut the recipe in half just in case it didn't turn out (hate to waste good ingredients) and did alter it just a little to be honest. I did use a non dairy margerine and water instead of milk but I had to for dietary reasons. I cannot imagine it coming out better though. It was flakey and light not greasy at all. The recipe called for lemon and almond I was a little eh about that so I used vanilla and nutmeg wich is really just a preference. I also gave the dough 2 turns and then left it in the fridge overnight giving it the last turn in the morning before rolling out. This is a sticky dough so please do not add more flour to it as that will make it tough. Instead flour the table or pastry board evenly not neccessarily generously when rolling. use flour to roll as needed but watch how much you use as with any pastry dough. I also like to brush off the excess as I fold the dough over to minimize the addition of flour. This should be a very soft dough. Also I recommend wrapping in parchment paper as opposed to wax paper. It will not stick as much.",

Placing tiny bits of cold butter on the rolled dough & then folding & rolling, endless number of times got to me.\n\nBut the idea of mixing some flour with soft butter, rolling it into a thin layer, made cold & then used is BRILLIANT! I laud the person who thought of this.\n\nI made my pastry today & am so happy with the results. I used a home-made mix of ground roasted almonds with baked mashed apples, raisins, cinnamon, sugar & some butter as a filling. I dare not make this too often as it tastes so good but is so rich. ",

I had the frozen pineapple  to make a filling, just wasn't sure on the pastry.  This is definitely a more sophisticated recipe then many but it works well and is scalable.  I used about a quarter of most ingredients and used one envelope of dry yeast.  Worked like a charm.  Wife loved the result.  If you haven't been successful with this, print out the recipe and read it carefully.  Slow down.  Chill the dough a bit longer.  Don't forget to roll the dough out and fold it extra times.  On your final roll make sure you get it down to 1/4 inch.  Don't forget the rise after you fill the pastry.  It will double - it really will especially if you set it on the stove with the oven on (or recently on).  Good luck and good pastry!",
