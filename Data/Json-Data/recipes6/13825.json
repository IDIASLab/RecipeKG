                "reviewBody": "I like to make this broccoli when I'm making an \"asian\" themed dinner. You can make this lighter and lower in salt by eliminating all the extra salt called for in this recipe as the light soy sauce provides all the salt the recipe needs. Two tablespoons of sesame oil was way too much for us the first time I made it so I'll usually add a teaspoon at a time until I get to the right taste. Rice wine vinegar is also good used in place of the regular white vinegar if you have that on hand. I like to add either toasted sesame seeds or chopped roasted peanuts and a touch crushed red pepper for added flair. My kids aren't much for broccoli but they'll eat this up willingly without complaint. It's all about trying what works for your family and making it good for who you're feeding. NOTE: Using the dressing for this recipe and substituting broccoli slaw works well for this recipe too. GREAT for making wraps with cold teriyaki pulled pork.",

I adjusted the seasonings somewhat to suit my own tastes which I believe we always should do. Keeping the amount of soy sauce the same I reduced the vinegar oil and sugar by half - I prefer it that way but won't fault the recipe as this is purely subjective. As for the sesame oil the type wasn t specified so I used regular sesame oil and then the tiniest dribble of the fragrant and potent toasted sesame oil. I garnished it with toasted sesame seeds and served it at room temperature. Broccoli never tasted so good.",
