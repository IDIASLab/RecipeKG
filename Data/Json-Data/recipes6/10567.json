Made a great loaf of bread (excellent toast as mentioned my other reviewers!) but I am not sure if I will try this again anytime soon...(: Thanks for the post & letting me try somethign different! Update: So far this has not worked for me. I have started the starter (repetative phrase there!) twice. The 2nd time I got a few bubbles but it wasn't enough to continue with making the bread.
