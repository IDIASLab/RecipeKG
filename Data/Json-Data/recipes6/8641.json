Roasting adds an extra depth of flavor, while mellowing the usual bite you'd get from the onion and garlic. If you have an air fryer with a smaller basket, you can halve the recipe or roast the veggies in 2 batches. The longer you let the salsa sit, the better it becomes!",

Although I didn't use an air fryer, I made the recipe as directed after roasting the tomatoes, garlic, onion, and a large jalapeno on the grill. My jalapeno was actually quite hot and lended to a good amount of heat in the salsa, which we enjoyed. Thank you for this perfect salsa recipe!",
