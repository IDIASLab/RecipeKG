I didn't have orange rind but I did use Cointreau and I would have liked more orange which the rind would have given so I won't knock them for that. I also didn't have baking chocolate so I mixed cocoa and melted shortening together in the microwave (3T cocoa and 1T shortening for every ounce of baking chocolate). Then I just melted the butter into that in the microwave to save cleaning a pot. And I didn't have nuts (what did I have on hand??) so I just left those out. Next time I'd add some salt - they're very sweet which is obviously a good thing but they could just use a little salt to balance it out and bring out more of the chocolatey flavor. I might also try cherry/almond instead of orange next time to see how that is. Overall this recipe is a keeper - they turned out with just the fudgey texture I love in a brownie.",

My brownies stayed together fine and were quite moist. They didn't need the extra butter or eggs and since my chocolate was already slightly sweet (it's like using semisweet chocolate ) I didn't add any sugar at all. They were plenty sweet. I also made a blondie version in the exact same way except that I used 1 small package butterscotch chips and 1 small package white chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate.
