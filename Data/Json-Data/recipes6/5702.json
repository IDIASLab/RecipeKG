I used chicken breasts because I didn't have a whole chicken on hand, but prepared and shredded them as directed in the recipe.  Since we skipped the rice (to serve over) I let it simmer/reduce for a little longer than directed to thicken.  It got four out of four thumbs up, picky eaters included.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!\n\nJust a post-script (2 years later):  This is still a 5-star, often used recipe in my house.  I have since adapted this recipe for the crockpot by tossing in everything but the okra and file powder (and shrimp, if using) at once.  I usually use frozen chicken breasts if preparing this way.  Cook on high 6ish hours or low 10ish hours (you'll know it's about done when it starts to smell soooooo good), then shred the chicken and return to crockpot.  Add okra during the last 30 - 60 mins, and shrimp at the end, maybe 15ish mins... keep your eye on the shrimp.  Add file before serving.  I've also swapped out the andouille sausage in a pinch for whatever I had on hand and it's great every time.  We really LOVE this recipe, thanks again for sharing it!",

First, I used chicken thighs instead of the whole chi ken, then I seasoned the chicken and coated it with flower and browned it in the pot I was going to make my gumbo in before adding water. This adds a little more flavor and color to the gumbo. But besides those few changes it was great. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!!",

He is a decent follow the directions sort of cook and he did with this recipe even making a quick trip to the grocery store to pick up a couple of things. He followed the recipe and the outcome is well worth bragging about. It made a big potful and unless our grandson (the bottomless stomach)shows up in the next day or so I am going to freeze some of it for another delicious meal. I could rave on a bit more but I hope it is enough to say thank you again and please submit some more lovely meals like this one for us to enjoy.",

I also find it best to let each diner add his/her preferred amount of file at the table as if you add the file while the gumbo's cooking you may lose the file flavor in the leftovers.  Our guests have differing tastes for file and many do not like adding file to gumbo with okra (generally the gumbo thickening agent) already in it.\n\nAlso in NOLA more than a few like their gumbo with a scoop of potato salad instead of rice or just plain with a healthy side of NOLA-style French bread.",
