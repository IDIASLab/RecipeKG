The heavy cream was substituted with milk. I used a canned spaghetti sauce for ease. I used only 1 cup of mozzarella and added about 1 cup of chopped spinach. Everyone devoured it! The leftover ricotta was used to make a side dish of Ricotta Gnocci that I found in Allrecipes (these were great too). This dish looked very gourmet was very tasty and I think I'd like to give it a try with some goat cheese next time.
