I didn't use plain yogurt, I used banana cream yogurt. Since I like banana in my oatmeal, I also smashed 1/2 a banana and added it. The missions were delicious!!  To mKe them a little firmer, I left them in the oven about 15 minutes after the timer, with the oven turned completely off. Great recipe and I will make it again.",
