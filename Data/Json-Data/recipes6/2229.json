I was reluctant to try rutabaga in general. Thanks to my toddler's insistence we bought a rutabaga. (We were playing around with \"R\" words at the grocery store.) At home I jumped on my computer and this recipe looked promising. My rutabaga was on the smaller side (I didn't want to be wasteful if we didn't like rutabagas). I dumped the other ingredients together to melt/blend; otherwise I followed the directions. I didn't time my simmer but I waited until the rutabaga was tender. It's a good side dish to have simmering while preparing other things. THANK YOU for sharing this recipe.",

The flavors don't smell like they are going to meld well when you first start cooking it, but as the rutabaga sits in the sauce and absorbs the sweetness, it changes.  The recipe is super easy as well.  The hardest part was cutting the stubborn rutabaga!  2 thumbs up.   We partnered this with rice, and it made a nice alternative dinner for us.",
