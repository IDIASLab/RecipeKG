I dissolved the sugar in the water with the yeast and let it sit for ten minutes.  I didn't use the same toppings, I used ground ham, spinach, a little mozarella, mushrooms and of course ricotta, which makes a \"real Italian Calzone, and for a little extra yum, a dash or two of Italian dressing, but the dough was great for calzone.  Very chewy and beautiful coloring.  I made 4 calzones out of this but cut them in half, so next time I will make 8 small ones.  Also it took only 20 minutes when I used my pizza stone, so time should be adjusted for the size of individual servings.",

What I did differently: Dough: slightly more yeast (Hodgson Mill All Natural Active Dry Yeast which was a 5/16 oz. pack); divided in four; rolled to 9\" cirlcles Filling: used Italian 4-cheese blend; mixed and chilled cheeses but not toppings; topped with different approximately 1 1/2 cups combined diced pepperoni diced ham canned mushrooms canned and drained diced tomatoes diced onions and diced green peppers. Hints: use a lightly floured silicone baking mat - this lets you easily fold half the dough over the filling and transfer to baking sheet; use a small roller for small dough formations; spread your cheese down the middle and work toward one side of the round adding toppings in the same manner; leave at least a half inch margin on side with filling; lightly brush that half's edge with some of the beaten egg to make sealing the edges easy; serve with a dipping sauce (like \"Way Easy Pizza Sauce/Bread Stick Dip\" also featured on allrecipes.com - see my review for how I doctored that to fit my tastes and better match my alterations to this calzone recipe). Bottom Line: This was really easy and worth the time required. Adapt to your own taste keeping in mind the total volume of the filling.",
