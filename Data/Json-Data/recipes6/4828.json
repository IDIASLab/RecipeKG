I didn't have zucchini so I used a small crook neck yellow squash which completely fell apart and blended into the soup so nobody even knew it was in there. 3 cups of broth was not enough I used a quart and then still added a bit more water. Rather than open a can of evaporated milk for just 1/4 cup I used cream. Thinking about it I could have probably added a whole can of evaporated milk and had a really creamy soup.",
