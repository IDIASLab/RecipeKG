It's equally delicious with whole wheat flour and I add a tablespoon of vanilla. I use brown sugar instead of white and 3/4 cup is enough (for 10 servings). I always use fresh fruit instead of frozen. In my oven it always takes at least an hour and a half to cook and it's a very moist bread. So far I've made strawberry raspberry strawberry cranberry and strawberry kiwi versions of the recipe and they have all turned out very well.",
