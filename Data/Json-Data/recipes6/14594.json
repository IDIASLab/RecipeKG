After reading all the reviews I'm seeing MANY who didn't even follow the recipe -so don't allow any low ratings to impact your decision. If you follow the directions and use the stated ingredients you'll get a fresh marinara sauce that is bursting w/ flavour!!! Simple way to peel the tomatoes - cut a shallow X in the bottom of each tomato and submerge in boiling water for about 15-20 seconds. Remove and submerge into ice water to stop the cooking process then peel the tomatoes. You don't really have to even bother chopping them. I mashed mine down w/ a potato masher. At first I thought it looked too watery and didn't want to add in the 1/4 cup water - DON'T make this mistake!!! You DO want to add in the water. Also you DO want to cover and simmer for the full 45 minutes - this is what allows the lycopene from the tomatoes to develop. I used 1/8 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp salt and found it to be the perfect amount. I waited until the last 10 minutes to add in the basil as fresh herbs lose their flavour if cooked too long. My only complaint...it doesn't make enough! As is it might make 1/2 cup (based on the size of tomatoes used)",
