In the list of ingredients it lists 2 teaspoons of butter to toast the pecans, but in the directions it stated 2 tablespoons of butter. Unfortunately I used the 2 tablespoons which made the pecans too oily. Also, I think the pecans should be changed to 1 cup and perhaps a 1/4 cup of sugar would be sufficient if you use a high quality pure maple syrup as I did. Perhaps delete the salt if using salted butter, or use unsalted butter. I will make this recipe again though with these alterations.",

I even had to sub some walnuts for the pecans since I didn't have quite enough, and it was still scrumptious. I did use others' suggestions and added a Tablespoon of flour to the filling, and only used 2 teaspoons of butter to toast the nuts.  I also took a chance and subbed dark brown sugar for the white sugar. The maple flavoring was subtle and not overpowering. It was amazing; this is the first pecan pie I've made (and I've made many) that didn't have the sugary liquid oozing into the crust and making it soggy.  I will never use another pecan pie recipe again!  My taste buds thank you for helping me make my favorite pie at home, however, my waistline does not!",

I was out of corn syrup and CRAVING pecan pie like no one's business so I was very excited to find a recipe that called for maple syrup as I had that on hand. It was the high grade kind and although I did like the somewhat mild flavor I still thought that the pie could have used a little more depth of flavor. I didn't toast the pecans in the butter- I just did them in the toaster oven- so perhaps that was the culprit. In any event I think that when I make it next time I will add a few tablespoons of JD whiskey to amph it up a bit:)",

I put tinfoil carefully around the edges of the crust to keep them from turning too brown. I use vanilla from Mexico. Thanks for this recipe! Everyone loves it (and I live in the South - if that tells you anything). I do not use the exact time because of the oven but pull it out when it puffs lightly in the center and does not jiggle.",
