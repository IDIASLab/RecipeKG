I followed the recipe to the letter but after 20 minutes the \"cake\" wasn't even cooked all the way through. Things didn't improve even when I doubled the baking time. For the base cake I used the Four Egg Yellow Cake which is also on AllRecipes.com For my taste I switched to cake flour instead of the all-purpose flour. The owner of this recipe should review the ingredients a hundred times over before sharing it with the public. I lost quite a bit of time as this cake was supposed to be served at my father's birthday party.",
