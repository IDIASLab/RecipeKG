I also used coconut oil to fry them in beforehand. I chose green beans for the veg and they were great. I also used a popular curry paste. Making it again tonight. I will be using a green curry paste this time. And cod and shrimp instead of chicken. I will also include Sweet potato with the green beans. Because we like it hot and the kiddo does not I make the curry sauce saving about a cup. I blend this with the jalape\u00f1os and heat in a small pan separately. When serving we just add a big spoonful of this superheated sauce for heat and flavor.",

I didn't increase any other of the ingredients and it was plenty of sauce. Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I substituted a tsp of dried coriander. My super picky 8 year old even asked for seconds! After the chicken legs were gone I cubed a few sweet potatoes and a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts and made a soup using the remaining sauce. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Well no need to crave again. I followed the recipe pretty much all the way except: I used 4 legs and 4 thighs (still had plenty of sauce) my store didn't have Thai basil so I had to use regular. What I'd change: we like it spicy so I'm going to leave the seeds in 1 or 2 of the jalape\u00f1os more ginger (I wish the amount noted in the recipe was more specific) I'd change nothing else. The sweet potato and eggplant were delightful. I'm going to try this with beef next time. Definitely a keeper",

I only added one jalape\u00f1o so it wouldn't be too hot for the kids. I couldn't find McCormick's red curry powder so I used a tablespoon of red curry paste (Mae Ploy brand) and I didn't add any basil leaves. For veg I used 2 white potatoes a can of baby corn brown mushrooms and sliced red pepper. I used cane sugar just because. I'll make this again the sauce is such a good base. I served it with jasmine rice. I think next time I'll use chicken breast or chicken thighs. Just a preference because even after crisping it it ended up soggy in the final product and I don't enjoy picking skin out of my bowl.",

I also change out the veggies - I don't love eggplant. Use veggies that won't get soggy like a mixture of carrots potatoes green beans broccoli variety of peppers asparagus etc. You can substitute ginger powder for the fresh ginger if needed but I prefer the fresh. Once this is done cooking and ready to serve I add either sour cream OR greek yogurt (add either to taste) to the sauce and heat just enough to serving temperature - - - it helps slightly with the flavor and makes it a lot less runny.",
