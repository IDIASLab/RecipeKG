I followed the recipe and method with the exception of finely chopping the jalapeno pepper.  I did this is a heavy duty wok - really high heat and didn't have to spoon off any extra liquid from the chicken.  I didn't need half of the marinade either.  I used a large spoon and spooned a couple of spoonfulls of the marinade around the edge of the very hot wok  - so the liquid would immediately come to a boil and thicken quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Enjoy!",

For us, it\u2019s hard to beat orange chicken when well prepared by a fine Chinese restaurant as the flavor of the sauce is absorbed and clings to the battered fried chicken. This dish eliminates the batter and oil for cooking the chicken which reduces some fat and calories. We were very pleased with the outcome and thought this dish delivered a savory balance of sweet and spicy flavors. We will make this again.",

I will use the habanero again for this recipe I think it is a more flavorful heat than jalapeno. Will get green onions next time for more texture/flavor. It tastes like Chinese take-out orange chicken minus the calorific batter around the chicken and it is truly non-greasy!!! Loved it!!! But I am taking 1 star off because the recommended length of cooking the chicken made it dry and overcooked. But I will make it again when I have a hankering for Chinese food without the extra calories.",

I'm a little bit of a wuss but my husband isn't and even he found it hot enough which he usually doesn't. Next time I'll use 1/2 the jalapenos take my portion out of the pan add the other 1/2 and give it to Mr. I can eat anything. The other thing is the cooking times are all a bit long. Use your judgment. Finally sorry Chef John but I don't like to add my snow pea pods that early. I added them with the jalapenos at the end. I like them quite crispy and just heated through. My version came out a bit darker than in the video but it was delicious and a definite keeper.",
