Instead of the sugar, eggs and flour, I used a can of sweetened condensed milk.  I cut the lime juice to 1/2 cup as the other reviews said it was a bit tart. I also put a thin layer of whip cream made with heavy whipping cream and sugar just to add a little something.  I decorated it with slices of lime.  I made it for a Christmas party so everyone was glad to not have the traditional stuff they were having at every other party.",

I followed the directions for the filling, and found that it was very tart, but I could not identify a strong lime flavor.  In the future, I think I would cut down slightly on the juice, but add a little bit more zest.  That way it will be good and limey, but won't make me pucker with each bite!  For the crust, I added 1/4 c. sugar, and I baked it for 6 min. at 375 before adding the filling.  I like a crispier crust.",

Using Key Lime juice is absolutely necessary.  You can buy it by the bottle in most grocery stores so you don't have to crack knuckles juicing key limes.\r\n\r\nTook the advice of a previous review also and instead of chilling in the refrigerator, put it in the freezer and it was nice and cool when I served it.\r\n\r\nNo doubt.....this cheesecake is FAN-TAB-U-LOUS!!
