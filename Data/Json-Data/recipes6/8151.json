I chucked a cabbage and some other bits I could remember from the recipe into the cart and legged it to the cashier before he could change his mind. I used a desert apple red onion lemon juice instead of vinegar I had to use a smoked sausage from the deli as I couldn't find chicken sausages this recipe was simple quick to put together and I loved the uncomplicated flavour of it... my son decided he doesn't like black pepper so he pushed it around his plate but ate the sausages... you win some you lose some.",

I prepared exactly as written except that I tossed the cabbage mixture right in the jelly roll pan and put the sausage in the oven at the same time as the cabbage. Nice way to get a few more veggies in our diet!",

I used 2 apples and cut up the Italian chicken sausage into bite size pieces. I also used 1 1/2 tsp. Of Adobo in place of the salt/pepper. I had to cook the chicken sausage for 25 minutes so the next time I will simply add it at the beginning of the cook time. I served this with toasted Italian bread and my husband enjoyed it. It left us both very full...will definitely make this dish again!",

I did that the 2nd time I made it, and felt it was a big improvement.  I also switched to apple cider vinegar which was a nice compliment to the chopped (Honey Crisp) apple.  I used Aidell's chicken pineapple sausage, and sliced it before baking, which worked very well.  A friend thought caraway seed might also be nice, but I have not yet tried that.",
