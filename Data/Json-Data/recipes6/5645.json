I was hesitant about the honey and mustard but figured it must be an amazing flavors since most have liked it. I was wrong. It was ok. If you don't really like a sweetness to your dinner then definitely skip this one. I agree with another reviewer about the nice mix of chicken/rice/beans/veggies but just didn't like the honey mustard sauce. Perhaps I'll keep the filling but change the sauce to something different.",

I did make 4 minor changes: (1) used whole wheat tortillas (2) baked as burritos, not as a casserole, (3) instead of mixing the sour cream/honey/mustard mix in dish I drizzled it in the middle of the burrito b4 I rolled it and then also on top of the burrito, and (4) added a little salsa to the top of the burritos. I only used about 1/4 - 1/3 of the honey/mustard/sour cream mixture .... i think the dish would have been WAY too sweet using the entire mixture. The recipe really is awesome, easy and healthy!!",

I think that the yellow rice is going to be essential and I'm really glad that I found it- it wouldn't be the same with white or brown rice since it has the seasonings already there. I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did use large burrito-size tortillas and I could have gotten away with just two on bottom and two on top. Although very good as is I think that next time I will do these in actual burrito form rather than a casserole and maybe up the rice by another 1/2 cup. Thanks for a unique lighter twist on burritos!",
