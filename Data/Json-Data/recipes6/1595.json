When done, I simply put them on the grill for 5 minutes to give that barbecued flavor!  Simply fell off the bone! And absolutely no mess!! Soo good!!!",

I did a few things different but the cooking instructions were exactly as described.  I did use my own marinade and let them marinade for 6 hours before cooking.  Marinade made with two bottles of Guiness, paprika, tamerik, garlic, pepper, BBQ sauce and A1.  Then cooked in BBQ with the ice cubes as instructed.  Then at the end, hit it with some BBQ sauce and cooked for 5 minutes on flame.  Amazing.  I originally wanted to keep checking it to see if it's cooking but I put it on the BBQ in foil, off flame at 400 degrees and didn't touch it for 1 1/2 hours.  It was perfect.  I used a 4 burner BBQ and just ignited the left and right burners and put the aluminum foil wraps in the middle off flame.  Then added the BBQ at the end blacking it for 5 mins.  Da Bomb",
