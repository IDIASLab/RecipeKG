My husband and son kept raving about how good they were. The only thing I didn't have and this is a biggie and my husband's fault was the bacon. He said we had some...which we did but it was frozen solid so I had to make without it. Like the previous review just the burger alone is great so even without the bacon tasted great. Thanks SarahChristine we will make these again...with bacon of course.:-P",

Combined w/ the sweet mushrooms and onions (which I added a bit of salt and pepper to) and the salty bacon this was a winning combination! I love guacamole but I really could've left it out...it didn't hurt it at all but I don't really think that it added anything special. I mixed up my burgers and shaped them the night before to allow the flavors to blend. I will def be making these again and again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I'd even go one step further and say it would be better without the dang bread crumbs but then it may not hold together well given all the other liquid ingredients which the bread crumbs of course would absorb. As it was Hubs found it a challenge to keep these from falling apart as he was grilling them. Also adding the sugar to the onion-mushroom mixture just didn't appeal to me. I left it out and the recipe didn't seem to suffer for it. Find a way to lose or reduce the bread crumbs without the mixture becoming too wet and you'll have yourself a 5-star burger (not meatloaf).",

I can see how you can leave it out if you're also topping with mushrooms and onions but our's were IN the burger and the guacamole was fantastic on top.
