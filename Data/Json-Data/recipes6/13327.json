After making the \"crust\", form it into a ball and place the ball in the middle of a SPRAYED pie pan, flatten and spread the cookie dough crust out and up the sides of the pan with your fingers, it will get sticky but instead of watering or oiling your fingers just lightly flour the surface of the dough. It also takes about 12-15 minutes for the crust to brown around the edges. Don't wait for the crust to get totally browned because when it cools it will crumble like an overbaked cookie.\r\nFor the glaze.....the cornstarch needs to be dissolved in cold water before being placed in the saucepan with the rest of the ingredients, so reserve 1/2 cup of the water needed in the glaze to dissolve the cornstarch in, then pour the cornstarch mixture in with the rest of the ingredients. Also, once the glaze comes to a boil reduce the heat to low. The glaze will thicken upon cooling. When ready to assemble the pie, you may need to reheat the glaze slightly to get it to pouring consistency. \r\n\r\n",

After baking the pie crust and cooling it I take 1/2 of an 8oz pkg. of cream cheese mixed with a tablespoon of powdered sugar and put that on the bottom of the crust before adding the strawberries. Also when making the \"sweet syrup\" I add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of lemon or lime juice (just enough to give it a little tart taste) and a 1/2 pkg. strawberry jello. Very very good. thank you Pat for a wonderful recipe.",

Next time I will give my pan a quick shot of spray oil.",
