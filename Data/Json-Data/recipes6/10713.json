After reading a couple reviews, I too, put less sugar (1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown in batter, and only 1 c. brown in icing) and it gets more fabulous everytime I eat another piece!! Very moist, not too sweet but definately satisfies the sweet tooth. I also omitted the nuts but am going to try pecans next time. I've tried a lot of recipes on this site and don't leave reviews often but this one deserves the praise and I highly recommend it!",
