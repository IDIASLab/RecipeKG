Second I used 3 granny smith apples which was more than enough. For the crescent pastry it is very simple. All you do is unroll it carefully and pinch all the seams of the triangles together to restore the rectangular shape without cuts in it. Then placed the apple mixture down the center of the dough lengthwise. Cut a few slits perpendicular to the apples (horizontally in direction of the apples) and bring each band to the top of apples one by one to wrap the apples in a nice almost lattice manner. Pinch sides well to avoid any overflow in the oven. Also to minimize cleanup line your baking tray with parchemint paper or foil b4 putting the pastry on it. Tastes wonderfully delicious! Such an easy recipe and the filling doesnt taste like cheese at all. It tastes more like the custard filling in a danish! Thanks for sharing!",

I couldn't figure out how to put the two rolls of crescent dough together - it doesn't say anything about rolling it out or anything.  Anyway, I used the cuts in the rolls themselves to criss-cross over the apples and cream cheese mixture.  I've done stuff like this in a wreath pattern using the same technique (Pampered chef recipes), but you lay out the crescent dough in a circle, then fold it over - I think that would be good too.  Also - I used more of the cinnamon/sugar mixture with the apples.",

                "reviewBody": "This was a huge hit!  The cream cheese filling firms right up after baking to make a nice filling (so don't be afraid of doing the whole amount).  I also prefer MORE apples (with much more of the sugar and cinnamon mixed in)- there is plenty of dough to cover the apple and cheese filling.  I also pre-cooked the apples for about 5 minutes in the microwave so they would be nice and soft in the pastry.  \r\n\r\nSome tips on handling the crescent dough:\r\n\r\nFirst of all make sure your dough is straight out of the fridge and is still cold while handling.  Use a LARGE cookie sheet or jelly roll pan so both cans of dough fit.  Lay them out side by side (longer end of rectangle together) and pinch all seams (or even just buy the new SEAMLESS crescent dough!!).  Before putting filling down the center, make cuts along the two longest sides about 3-4 inches long, and one inch wide.  Then assemble filling to your liking (I liked pouring the cream cheese first and spreading lightly to be even and then spooning the apples over the top of the cheese so the apples peek through the top).  To make a braid pattern- take each strip of dough, twist once and lay across the filling (it doesn't have to go all the way across, just past the middle).  Do this in an alternating pattern switching from one side to the next until the whole pastry is \"braided\".  \r\n\r\nI hope these tips help!",

I also put more than 1T of the cinnamin sugar mix on the apples - I put at least half and that still left plenty for the topping. Only problem I had was not getting my crescent seams pinched together enough. When I went to cross the 1\" pieces some broke. I also found 3 apples a little too much to easily cover. Maybe 2 to 2 1/2 would be better - depends on the size of the apples. It looked pretty brown after 35 minutes but it tasted perfect. Really great when it's still warm out of the oven.",
