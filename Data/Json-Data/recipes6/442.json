It's a very light-colored sauce due to the peaches. The seasonings are almost spot on, but I felt this needed a bit of salt to really bring out the flavors.  I used mild jalapenos which gave the sauce a nice subtle heat without being overpowering.  While I found it really good as written, it was a little odd that it was uncooked, so I ended up blending all the ingredients and simmering it about 20 mins to concentrate the flavors.  This would excellent on chicken or shrimp.",
