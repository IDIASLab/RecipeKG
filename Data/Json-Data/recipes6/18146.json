I used organic lemons, since I figured it's the one time where the part of the lemon I'm the most interested in is the outside! After peeling off chunks of peel, I flipped them over and scraped them with the side of my knife to remove all of the pith. The end result made enough for x-mas presents for a few people and some for me to keep as well! My recommendation for drinking this: mix with pomegranite juice or cranberry juice. The flavors work so perfectly together, it tastes like you're drinking candy!",

Look for lemon varieties that have a thick skin and are high in essential oils.  Try peeling thin strips with a potato peeler.  A zester will prematurely release the oils in the skin.  Try to avoid the pith (white part) as this is what causes bitterness.  Also try an alternative sweetener such as agave instead of refined sugar for a warmer palate feel.  This recipe will create a Limoncello that is a little low in alcohol over traditional Limoncello. If you are using Vodka (40% 80 proof) the final alcohol will be less that 20% instead of 30-35%. It will freeze at this proof.  A higher proof alcohol will extract out the oils and color faster. We love Limoncello so much we started a company in Sonoma to produce it commercially.

First I poured off just enough Vodka (100 proof) out of the bottle to fit the lemon peel directly into the Vodka bottle.  I then aged this for three weeks.  After combining the simple syrup with this mixture, I poured it back into the Vodka bottle and an emptied, cleaned wine bottle (or two if needed).  I let this age for three weeks as well, then strained.  I think leaving the zest in the mix for the second aging increased the lemon flavor and helped balance the sweetness.  Thank you for providing the recipe, its so much better than storebought.  ",
