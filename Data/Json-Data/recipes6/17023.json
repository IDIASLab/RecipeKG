I found that the bottom oaty layer was a tad crunchy though so if I make them again I think I'll melt the sugars with the butter so that they dissolve because I didn't really like the undissolved crunchy sugar crystals. The taste was amazing though (the topping is to die for!!!) so maybe I'll try them again with the variation I said. Some of my family refuses to eat them due to the crunchiness...more for me:)",
