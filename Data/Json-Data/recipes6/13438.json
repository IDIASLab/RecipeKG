I had lots of fresh blackberries from the farmers market. I took the pie to work and it disappeared! I took some other people's advice and cut down on the spices just a little and I also added cloves which made the pie taste wonderful. I didn't have blackberry brandy so I used a little juice from a fruit cocktail cup. It was absolutely wonderful! Don't hesitate to make your pie this way.",
