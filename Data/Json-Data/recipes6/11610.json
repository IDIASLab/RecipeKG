For those who are having trouble with the loaf falling apart or crumbling-remember when baking quick breads that overstirring it will cause those problems. You want to add the dry ingredients to the liquid and only stir enough to mix things together and then stop. It is better to err on the side of not enough stirring then too much. \"Just till combined\" means just that. I put powdered sugar on one loaf and drizzled icing on the other. Both made nice additions to my brunch luncheon. Thanks Karin.",

I buy extra bags of fresh cranberries in the fall and just toss them in the freezer as is so I can make this bread year round.  A belated thanks for sharing this recipe!",
