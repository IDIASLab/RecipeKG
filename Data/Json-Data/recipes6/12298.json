I was so afraid it might turn out like a fluffy cookie but found it did not. In fact I really noticed no difference with the extra leavening. Other than reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp. I made the recipe as written and found not much difference between other recipes I've tried. I chilled the dough for about an hour until semi-firm dropped the dough with a medium size scoop and flattened them just slightly before baking. Good dependable recipe.",

As written delicious chewy and appeals to a wide demographic (our Japanese friends raved over them!); slightly modified (aka 1/2 of the sugar)-still delicious slightly crispy and our friends still rave. We do let the dough sit in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before we drop them on a sheet. And out of the many times that we've made these only once have we used the full amount of sugar. 1.5 cups is a lot of sugar. That chocolate is WAY too much sugar! Very unhealthy! We make these cookies a bit too often... if you get my drift! Thanks for the recipe!",

This reminds me a lot of the Tollhouse cookies I've been making since I was a small child. I got soft chocolate chip cookies--quite like bakeries make. This will be excellent for school lunches. I plan on bagging them up in snack bags by two's and freezing. They'll be thawed and ready to eat by lunchtime. Very good. I was pleased that I didn't have to chill the dough and these didn't spread a lot which I was worried about. Next time I'll add a half cup or so of pecans. NOTE: 350 for ten minutes letting it rest for a minute on the hot pan was just right for me.",
