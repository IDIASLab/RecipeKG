Second, if you are piping the meringues out, make sure that the candy canes are very finely crushed.  Third, beat the eggs a little longer than you think you should (call it very stiff peaks).  Folding in the candy canes causes the eggs to deflate a little bit.   And finally, don't add extra peppermint extract like I did... mine are just TOO minty.",
