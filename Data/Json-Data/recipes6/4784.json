When I try this again I plan to use chicken broth instead of the vegetable and add bacon or ham cubes for interest and use tater tots instead of the hash browns. And I probably won't cook it as long; I think that contributed to the mushiness. And maybe more whole kernel corn. I didn't think there was nearly enough corn in it.",
