The cookies are supposed to be dry when they come out of the oven, but they soften with time. That's why we always made these a couple of weeks before Christmas. The dough was very easy to work with and the cookies came out looking great. They didn't puff up at all. They are very tasty as well. The trick to get them soft faster after they are assembled is to put them in an air-tight container with a few apple pieces overnight.  Thank you for a great recipe.",

I didn't have any almonds or cloves on hand so I substituted with more flour just a little more of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla extract. The lemon zest is a MUST for this recipe! The lemon flavor comes out beautifully and makes the cookie stand out. I opted for the cut-out method and used star cutters. I had to tweak the flour content to get the consistency to where it wasn't sticky and/or falling apart. I also chilled the dough for about half an hour before rolling and cutting out the shapes. I raised the temperature to 375 as well since my first batch seemed to puff up and ruin the star shape. Spreading the raspberry jam was very simple. Remember to spread a very thin layer and use a quality jam. Top with a bit of powdered sugar and they're the perfect gift.",

My only problem was the whole rolling out of the ropes thing - it just wasn't happening with my dough.

I think I may make these again soon.",

I didn't blanch the almonds but I did toast them in a dry iron skillet before grinding them in a recently purchased coffee grinder. The dough was flattened into a disk and wrapped in plastic wrap before chilling over-night. I used parchment paper on my baking sheets and had no trouble removing them after they finished baking. The cookies were fairly labor intensive but then I think any rolled cookie is work! I will be proud to include them on my Christmas cookie trays this year.",

An avid baker perhaps my taste is too picky but I found this cookie very dry (following the recipe exactly). The flavors were great but the thick crust using half of the dough really distracted from the result. Perhaps a thinner crust altering the amounts to make it more moist or something else. As I said the flavor of the dough was GREAT it was just too dry. (Perhaps that is the way it is supposed to be...) Thanks for taking the time to share your recipe.",
