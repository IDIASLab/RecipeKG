Because although the sauce is very good the sweetness of it overpowered the cake and I couldn't even taste the apples. I also think I'll reduce the cinnamon from 1 1/2 t. to just 1 t. Plus I would suggest adding a dollip of whip cream to the individual slices or serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. To cut some of the sweetness of the cake. This one goes in my recipe box.",

I was fearful it was going to turn out like a fruit cake but I added the full amt of walnuts and raisins anyway. The topping is the best part so do not skip it! I followed someone's suggestion and only used a 1/4 cup of each sugar. I believe it would overpower the taste of the apples otherwise. I thought the amt of butter in the topping was unnecessary so I only used a 1/4 cup. Pour all of the topping onto the cake. It tastes great warm and even better once it sets. A day later and there's only one piece left. Definitely a keeper.",

The icing is important and shouldn't be skipped but reducing it by half wouldn't be a bad idea. Plumping the raisins is nice and not mincing or chopping the apples too fine is good for texture. The icing does set and the next day it is firmer. Overall not expensive to make and absolutely worth making a second time etc.",
