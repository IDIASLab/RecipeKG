I only had 1/2 cup of butter so I used 1/4 cup butter flavor shortening which I think tends to make cookies a little greasy so I used 1 1/2 cup flour. I always add a teaspoon or two of instant coffee to chocolate recipes to deepen the flavor. The rest I did as written. They turned out fantastic! They aren't puffy but certainly not flat either. The edges are crispy and the centers are moist and slightly chewy. Thanks Litily these will be made again.",
