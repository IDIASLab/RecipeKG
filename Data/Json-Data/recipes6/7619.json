My disappointment quickly turned to excitement thinking of all the possibilities! I went into the kitchen and let what I had inspire me. I must say the result is darn delicious. Living a healthier lifestyle doesn't mean you have to give up decadence and these vegan chocolate tarts prove it. They're rich and so full of flavor they'll knock you off your chair.",
