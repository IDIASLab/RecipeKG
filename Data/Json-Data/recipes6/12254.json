I'm not sure why but I'm thinking of junior high cooking class.:) I didn't have dates and although I thought of substituting Craisins I decided to just omit that ingredient. I did a half-batch and used margarine. My mixer could handle blending all the ingredients although the corn flakes got well-crushed (which was fine no lumpy hard bits to bite through!). Only problem was that they really flattened out.. Tasted great (both the dough and the cookies!) and the flatness didn't bug me. In the future I'll probably use baking soda and baking powder (I do that change in most cookie recipes for softer thicker cookies) and I might try these as drop cookies next time. I WILL make these again! Thanks lrawlins!",

Pecans made them awesome. They went straight to the oven like drop cookies (not slice fridge ones). Enjoy!! I made these a second time w/o the oats and they came out flat so I'd make sure you have oats. Cook at a LOWER TEMP I did 325/350 degrees and cooked until the top no longer shines - much better.
