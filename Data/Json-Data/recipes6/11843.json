Skip all those cloves and cinnamon, that stuff is for the Americanized taste. Taste the nut, butter and the good syrup.\r\nHere is my syrup: purified water 1 3/4 cup, a small rectangular 2 inch cinnamon bark, 2 thin slice of ginger, 2 inches lemon peel (yellow part only), a touch (approx 1 tsp) of lemon juice. Let all those things boiled and simmer until the liquid reduce to 1 cup. Add  3/4 cup sugar and stir until dissolve, 1/2 tsp pure vanilla, 1 tbsp orange juice (no pulp)and turn the heat off. Add 1/2 cup of honey.  The syrup should be a light touch of golden color, and if you like you can put a 1/2 tsp of rose water or jasmine water.\r\nJust make sure the temperature of the Baklava and the syrup is not the same, one have to be cooler than the other or you will get some very soggy baklava.",
