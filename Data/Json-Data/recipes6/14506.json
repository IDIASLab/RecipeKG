Instead of making the crust I got a ready made Oreo pie crust but followed the rest of the directions just like they are shown & it turned out great. I also made a second one & added butterscotch pudding to the cream cheese & sweetened condensed milk mixture that came out well also The pudding made it very thick but once everything else was on it & chilled for 3 hours.....well both of them within 30 mins. of putting them on the table were gone & I have requests for more.I wonder if the people that said it wouldn't set use evaporated milk instead of the sweetened condensed milk? I know that I almost made that mistake. Just a thought.",

Mine was set so that it was the same thickness as the cream pie filling you buy at a store! I was so creamy and sweet! I actually folded some melted cholocate in the half of the filling and it was delicious! You just need to make sure you are using a can of SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK not evaporated milk. I agree with the previous reviewer - I think the people with \"filling not setting\" made a mistake using evaporated milk. I will make it again!",
