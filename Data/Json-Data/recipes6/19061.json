It was quite a time consuming dish to prepare - definitely not a 20 minute prep time as indicated in the recipe - double that at least. As with other reviewers we found the sauce WAY too sweet - I reduced the amount of sugar and it was still too sweet - more appropriate for a dessert - in fact we didn't even need dessert when we were done eating! As well I don't think provolone is the best cheese to use in this dish something with a creamier texture - brie perhaps.",

I read other reviews and noted that a couple folks thought the sugar amount was too much so I too cut it back to 2 TBSP but between that and the vanilla I did still find the flavor a bit too sweet. I ended up putting salt and pepper on my cutlet to cut back the sweetness. I also subsituted almonds for pecans because that's all I had on hand and that worked fine. I had neglected to re-read the sauce preparation directions and so I did not heat over a double boiler but directly over a flame in a sauce pan and it did make the egg yolks a little clumpy not frothy but taste-wise it was OK. My husband said he enjoyed it and that I should make this again. My children found it so-so but again I think because it was such an unfamiliar taste for chicken. I am giving this 4 stars because I think the combination of ingredients was very unique (but taste-wise I'd rate it a 3).",
