It's similar to apple crisp but because of the tartness of the cranberries it's has a bit of a sweet and sour vibe. The chopped pecans make it pop. Another reviewer suggested adding dashes of cinnamon on top which would probably be a nice embellishment. We served it with French Vanilla ice cream which was great. Whipped topping or a Cool Whip type product would also be good. After it cools you can warm individual servings up in the microwave for 45 seconds or so for just the right warm up time.",
