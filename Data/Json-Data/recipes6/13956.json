It comes out much more tender.\n2. I double the marinade, but put half in a separate container. This will be the sauce for the stir-fry veggies. \n3. First, I put on the beef with its marinade, and let it cook until done. Then, I remove the beef, and add stir fry veggies and pineapple with the other batch of marinade sauce. Once those are crisp tender, I add the meat back in to warm it up, as well as the sesame seeds, and serve over rice or noodles. \nIt's one of my favorite things to eat!!!",

Used half the marinade for the meat and marinated over 24 hours.  Then I stir fried the meat for a few minutes, added broccoli and rehydrated dried shitake mushrooms, and the rest of the marinade.  Covered and cooked til the broccoli was the way we like it, then added some cornstarch to thicken.  My husband said, \"You weren't expecting leftovers, were you?\"  (There are only two of us)  Next time I would omit the sesame seeds, as the oil gave it plenty of sesame flavor and the actual seeds got lost in everything else I added.  I know some people get upset when you change a recipe and review it the way you made it instead of the recipe, but we like what we like and this was easy and delicious to make the way you like it.  Neither of us found this too sweet, but it if you don't like slightly sweet main dishes, you may want to cut the sugar a little.",

However, the amount of sugar called for is about four times more than you need \u2013 so I did reduce it to just a fourth of what was directed, and used brown sugar rather than white.  It was just right.  As for the meat, I wanted something more tender than round steak for this quick cooking method so I used sirloin (No Name Steak, to be exact, that I always keep on hand for this very purpose).  I also included some good-sized shrimp and, to make this a complete meal, I stir fried some vegetables as well - baby bok choy, mushrooms, bean sprouts and onions.  I sprinkled on the toasted sesame seeds and green onion just before serving, in an amount that seemed right to me rather than measuring.  What I loved best about this recipe was its simple, clean flavors, not bogged down by lots of different spices or \u201cheat.\u201d",

(If you stick to the original, it may be a little too oil and sweet for your liking.)\n- Add 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce\n- If you want to add veggies (I added asparagus and steamed broccoli), double the sauce.
