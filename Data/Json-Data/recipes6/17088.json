Anyway,  it helps to make sure the marshmallow layer is completely cool before you spread on your frosting. I popped mine in the freezer for a bit.  I actually made a double batch of the frosting and that gave a nice thick layer of chocolate on top.  Yummy.  Don't worry about measuring the marshmallows exactly.  Just a nice covering on top is enough.",

Be careful with the sauce to \"spread over the melted marshmellows\" Ours just smeared into one spot removing the marshmellows from the top. If you make the sacue to spred over the top too soon it will harden before you can do anything with it. Once we remade the sauce and just poured it over the top they came out pretty tastey.",
