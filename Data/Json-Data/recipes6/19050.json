I made a couple of changes that enhanced the recipe for my family. #1 I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar; the brown sugar gives a deeper color & flavor. #2 Like other reviewers I used sesame oil dark in place of sesame seeds. #3 I used lots more onions in addition to scallions. Thanks Curlie for a delicious marinade.",
