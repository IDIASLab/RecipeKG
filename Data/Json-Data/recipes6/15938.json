These are sooooooo good! I made the first batch as written then made a second batch in the same bowl--didn't rinse it or anything--and made a second batch only using mint extract in place of the almond and vanilla in the glaze. This was because I had a real \"mint tooth\" going on. (Although I'm not sure if they are still Austrian;) ) I also replaced the nuts with mini chocolate chips in the second batch. They are sooooo good too! The glaze seems to stay prettiest if it stays warm. Mine got a bit grainy. Thanks for a keeper!",
