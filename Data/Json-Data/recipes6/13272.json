I have a tried and true recipe for Butterscotch Pie passed down from my great-grandmother but I wanted to try this one because it uses cornstarch (mine uses lots of flour). The taste texture and color are fantastic. However my meringue seperated from the filling as stated by previous reviewers. I made sure to seal the meringue right to the edges of the pie crust but the meringue still slides right off the pie when I slice it. But for that I would have gladly given this a 5-star rating. It tastes divine.",
