I don't enjoy sweetened meat so I left out the sugar but the pumpkin pie spice was still very sweetish (even though I put in less than 1/2 tablespoon for a big vat of chili). I'd suggest starting the pumpkin pie spice at 1/2 teaspoon and taste-testing from there to see if you want to add more. I ended up increasing the chili powder by at least double and adding a tablespoon of cumin a tablespoon of beef bouillon a tablespoon of tomato bouillon and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (too mild otherwise) to mask the sweetness of the pie spice. I also increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and added black pepper to taste. In the end that combination worked for me--it came out tasty and appealing even for my boyfriend who doesn't like chili. But given that the recipe makes a lot and it's not my favorite ever I don't think I'll make it again (save my spices and puree for pies!)",
