I've made pancakes with oatmeal before so I knew to let the batter sit 10-15 minutes as the oats need to soak up some of the liquid. This way you know to gauge if the batter needs more liquid. Mine did NOT. The pancakes puffed up nicely and turned out light and fluffy. My husband and kids ate up every single one of these pancakes......my husband especially surprized me by telling me how much he liked this recipe.",
