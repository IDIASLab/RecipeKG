That 1/2c. isn't listed with the ingredients! Are we supposed to set aside 1/2c. of the sugar to add to the egg or is that an additional 1/2c.???? I assume it was supposed to be set aside; but too late! So I added 1/4c. sugar to the beaten egg whites and it turned out just fine. I also substituted mango puree for the apricot. A lovely light fluffy sponge.",

For the first review you do have to set aside 3/4 cup of sugar because the recipe said to sift only 1/2 cup of the sugar.",

I didn't think the cake tasted too eggy and I did do less on the almond extract. This cake also reminds me of a souffle. In the pictures I posted I made the cake in a cake pan and not a tube pan. I also torted the cake into 4 layers and wrapped acetate around it. In between each layer I filled it with an apricot diplomat cream and fresh sliced strawberries. Then I glazed it with an apricot mirror glaze on top and garnished it with a few strawberries dipped in ganache. It was definitely a big hit and everyone loved it!",
