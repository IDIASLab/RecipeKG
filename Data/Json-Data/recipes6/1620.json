At the end of the tomato season, when the remaining tomatoes in the garden will not ripen, this is a great use for them. A note from my mother: I put a heaping teaspoon of tapioca on the bottom crust before I fill it. It will absorb some of the liquid.",

I make a massive batch with whatever green tomatoes are left in the garden - so its something like 3 pounds of tomatoes, 3 pounds of apples, as many raisins as you've got....then once it cools I package it in quart size freezer bags and freeze them indefinitely.  They never freeze solid so whenever you want a pie, just pull out a bag and throw it in a crust.",
