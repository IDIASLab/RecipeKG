I didn't change anything else, and this dessert turned out very well. It is not too sweet or too decadent, but it satisfies a chocolate craving. I let it cool until it was just warm and the sauce was thickening, and then served it in bowls with scoops of vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again.",

I skeptically threw this together with the following changes: made self rise flour with 1c. ap. flour, 1 1/2 tsp bkg pwdr, 1 tsp. salt.  Used only 4 TBSP butter and about 1 1/4 C boiling water.  Used heaping measurements for the Cocoa Powder.  I also baked it in my 9x9 stoneware piece.  This dessert completely exceeded my expectations. The cake-like part set up perfectly and the \"sauce\" was exactly like hot fudge - built right in there!  I couldn't have been happier with the results and am thrilled to add this to my collection of sweet, simple - TOTALLY satisfying recipes. Anyone who's tried it with a result that didn't knock their socks off should try it again with some changes!  ",

Another review listed here said this was a very good version and I have to agree! It was a huge hit with everyone I served it to, both kids and adults.  I served it with vanilla ice cream this time, I might try just fresh whipped cream next time around.  I'm sure I'll make it again soon.

I made as directed and while my kids enjoyed the flavor, the end result was a little on the greasy side and very runny.  Next time I will cut the butter down to 4 Tbsp and increase the flour, sugar, cocoa powder,milk mixture (maybe even double it?).  I think if you tweaked the measurements you could end up with something similar to a molten chocolate cake.  It has potential but as written it's not right.",

This recipe deserves a lot more than 5 stars because the taste is wonderful and it is so, so easy.  This cobbler is rich and the right amount of rich.  The sauce is a perfect smooth chocolate and is complemented by the cakey topping, which by itself is a treat.  Chocolate cobbler is perfect for a chocolate fix.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe I will make again and again!  (Since I didn't have self-rising flour, I used 1 cup flour and added 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt).",
