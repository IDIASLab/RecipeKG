The directions said to strain the vegetables and throw away excess vegetable broth?! This makes no sense thats where the vitamins are not to mention I bought good stock and it is not cheap. So I used less broth I used enough to cover the vegetables which is how it is supposed to be in the end. I actually used half of the stock called for in the recipe. Instead of straining and separating it I did what I always do with this type of soup recipe and used a hand held blender and put it in the pot and zapped the whole lot. Save the vitamins and work!!.",

Most carrot soups I have made previously have had a strong carrot flavour but this particular soup was mellowed with the addition of potatoes. The dill (I used a 1/4 tps. of dried dill weed ) and the ginger gave the soup a lovely delicate flavour and it is a soup I would heartily recommend. Love this website!",
