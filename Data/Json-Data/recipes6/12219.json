I also added lemon extract to filling and vanilla extract to crumb. I say crumb but it came out more like a cookie topping (maybe because i used more oats and also used marg instead of shortening) Oh i omitted the salt and water all together. They came out amazing!

I found the topping was a little much and will cut it back to about one third rather than one half of the crumb mixture.

Although I was a little disappointed (it would make a great pineapple crisp) the filling was so good that I will give this another try and see if it's just me or the recipe.",
