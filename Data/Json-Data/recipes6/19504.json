I used 1-1/2T, but would recommend starting with 1T, because if there is too much heat the maple flavor gets lost.  I used plain, unsweetened soy milk mixed with about 1T cornstarch in place of heavy cream, & it thickened up right away.  Next time I make it, I may increase the maple syrup a little, like to a generous 1/4 cup.  I served it over jasmine rice. I liked the concept when I read the recipe, and the recipe met my expectations well.  This one is a definite keeper.",

You can taste the maple syrup but it isn't overpowering and provides a complex but light sweetness to balance the curry. I did use mild curry paste though as I was making it for my family who don't like spicy things. i also had to use whipping cream (35%) because the grocery store didn't carry heavy cream but it still reduced nicely and thickened up for me. This is definately going to be something I make again.",

Used about 3 cups of chicken breast left out the sugar and substituted 1 can coconut milk as others suggested used 2 TBS maple syrup and about 2 1/2 TBS medium biryani curry paste since that's what was in the fridge. Could have used more but didn't want to make it too hot for the family. I would cut down the maple syrup to 1 TBS next time as my family found it quite sweet but maybe that's because of the kind of curry I used. I like that there is plenty of curry sauce. Tip: we ate it with Tandoori naan bread purchased at the grocery store and heated up by holding it with tongs on top of the gas burner on either side until slight char marks show and then buttered. Served beside steamed green beans carrots and cauliflower. Thanks for a fast and easy and tasty dish.",
