Took out of the oven at 25 minutes, and it was just a bit on the dry side, so I might check for doneness sooner the next time.  Not a major problem because a little milk drizzled over the top did the trick.  Super easy to make, not too sweet, and a hint of cinnamon never hurts.  Thanks for sharing this B&B\u2019s breakfast recipe, we enjoyed it.",

I used coconut oil instead  of vegetable oil, 3 eggs, 3 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 c brown sugar since we don\u2019t like too sweet and greased the pan with coconut oil.  I\u2019ve added in raisins, blueberries, and chocolate chips at different times and all were wonderful. Just as written is fantastic and is also easy to try different variations!",
