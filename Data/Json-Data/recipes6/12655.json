I have made this recipe five or six times and have had to add up to 9 cups of flour. If it's too sticky just keep adding flour. I went on a search for a cookie recipe that would make cookies like the ones my great-grandmother used to make--pale floury not very sweet--and this is exactly it. I made them for a family get-together and caused a sensation--everyone wanted to know where I found great grandma's long-lost recipe! They're good with or without icing although people who are accustomed to today's ultra-sweet desserts may not appreciate them plain. I think they're perfect by themselves and I give this recipe five stars. My sincere thanks to Kathy for sharing this recipe.",

I halved the recipe and it made a dozen and a half 2 1/2 inch cookies, just the right amount.  Since the dough was soft I just cut round cookies, though shapes would probably work well with this recipe, too.  I also used shortening instead of butter because I like a lighter sugar cookie, and added a teaspoon vanilla.  Since I live in Utah where the climate is dry, the amount of flour on the recipe was just right.",

Was looking for a recipe that used the ingredients I had on hand (mainly shortening instead of butter and baking powder/soda in place buttermilk or cream of tarter). Ended up using half whole wheat flour and half all purpose as this is all I had on hand - probably would omit the wheat flour next time. I did alittle of my own thing too - 3/4 c. brown sugar 1 tsp. vanilla extract 3/4 tsp. cinnamon - just to try and improve the flavor as others commented it turned out bland. I think those changes really helped. Also I live in SC so I ended up using around 9 c. of flour and refrigerated for about 6 hrs but the dough turned out perfectly - wasn't sticky at all. All in all this was a great recipe and will definately try it again - maybe with some butter shortening and no wheat flour next time =)",
