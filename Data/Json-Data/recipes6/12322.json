They are soft not overly sweet (even with a light frosting on top) and the blend of spices makes them unique and exciting among all of the other Christmas cookie choices (Chocolate or Vanilla anyone?) I am so pleased to see this recipe on allrecipes.com. Don't be afraid of doubling it because these cookies go quickly!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an old Betty Crocker recipe from the 50s and 60s. They are soft, spicy, moist and cake-like. When we're sending them somewhere or are taking them to someone's house or a bake sale, we like to sprinkle them with sugar spiked with ground ginger and a pinch of cinnamon before putting them in the oven. That makes a neat substitute for the messy frosting, which always makes the cookies stick together unless you put them in a single layer in the tin, which is near impossible. This also cuts down on kitchen time. If you don't like the flavor of molasses, dark corn syrup can be successfully substituted for half or all of it, which gives a somewhat different, more subtle taste, while still retaining the appealing soft texture. The house becomes wonderfully fragrant as they bake. A family favorite - I kept the cookie jar full of these for the kids as they were growing up, and it's one of their fondest memories.",
