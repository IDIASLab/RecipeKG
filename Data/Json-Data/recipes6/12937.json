My family friends and I gobbled them up in 4 days. I would definetly recommend trying these!",

I added 1/4 cup water and 2 more tablespoons of flour because the mix was way too dry and was so crumbly I could form it at all but after adding water and more flour it was easier. When rolling into a ball also flatted it in your hand to form a cookie because it you don't you will get a cooked cookie ball instead of a normal cookie. The cookies were still a bit too dry for me even after adding water. This recipe definatley needs work and I really don't want to be the one to do it. I'll try another recipe next time. Oh well.",
