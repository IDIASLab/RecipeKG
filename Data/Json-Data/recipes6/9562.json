It was pouring rain, so we baked them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes instead of grilling, and they were perfect. The soy sauce in the marinade caramelizes and makes these wings a gorgeous golden brown. They are mouthwatering-lick-the-bones-clean-and-fight-for-the-last wing good. Can't wait for the Super Bowl so that we can try them on the grill. Thanks PartyFil",

I doubled the marinade I made 6 pounds of wings, and marinated for 24 hours, I grilled them over Kingsford hickory charcoal, for about 20 to 25 mins to get a nice crisp and a little char on them, then popped them in a 325 degree oven for about 20 mins since I used some large wings, then served half with my own garlic buffalo sauce, and half plain and they both were wonderful, great marinade, thanks for the recipe!",

And I had to laugh at the post that said they won't serve this too often due to \"adding fat to an already fatty meat\" Hahaha - THAT'S BC IT'S A BUFFALO WING!! It's a snack meant for serving while watching a football game - not as a formal entree. Some people and most all restaurants actually DEEP FRY them before adding the sauce and butter so definitely not \"health food.\" It's a good thing the author didn't mention that they are traditionally served with Bleu Cheese Dressing for dipping!!",
