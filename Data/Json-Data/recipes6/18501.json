I told the husband it was southern sausage pie because he won't even try quiche! hee-hee.....he loved it! I tweaked this up a bit by using 1 lb. hot italian sausage[left out hot sauce and butter], added mushrooms, an extra egg and pimento.  It made two pies...but they were way too brown, even after covering with foil.[ergo the 4 stars]  Next time I'll use the 350 degree setting for the whole process.",

Instead of the sausage I used bacon and cooked the same way as instructed. I added about 1/2 cup of Spinach to the egg mixture and took out the Ranch and put Cream instead. I forgot to add the sugar pepper and salt but that ended up being alright. The pepper would have been nice but Im glad I didn't put in the salt. The bacon gave it the right amount. Also I decided not to add hot pepper sauce I'm not a fan of the flavor. Seems like a lot of changes but it was so good!! It's on my list of to make again.",
