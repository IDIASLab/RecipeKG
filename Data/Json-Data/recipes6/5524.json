My suggestion is to use frozen WHITE corn as it is sweeter and has a nice crisp pop. And, I would add more avocado (the ones I used were too small) otherwise it looks more like a corn salsa instead of avocado salsa. Per other suggestions here, I added a minced jalapeno (take out seeds and veins if you don't like the heat), chopped cilantro and sliced green onion. It makes this recipe just perfect!

I thought the balance of ingredients was off (too much corn for the amount of avocado) and the oregano just wasn't right for it.  I would definitely follow the advice of others and use cilantro instead.  I also think the addition of tomato and black beans might make it tastier.  Green onions would probably be a nice substitue for the regular onion.  I recommend the recipe called Black Bean And Corn Salad II on this site.  I found it much better.",
