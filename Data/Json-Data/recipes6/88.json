I used two 32 oz. bags of swedish meatballs a large can of chipotle 1 can of jellied 1 can had whole cranberries in it and a small scoop of brown sugar. Unfortunately I didn't have any pineapple so I didn't use it. I also didn't have alot of time so I microwaved the meatballs for a couple minutes and dumped everything into the crock pot. I tasted it before I added the sugar and thought it was a little sweet. I can't wait to try it with homemade meatballs! The sauce ingrediantes might be a nice glaze on a turkey or chicken.

(Not that cranberry sauce isn't wonderful any time of year.) I used homemade meatballs I had frozen two chipotles and two tsp. of the adobo sauce. I also neglected to drain the pineapple. It is -very- spicy. My boyfriend who generally isn't a spicy food kind of guy has declared it his new favorite dish. Oddly enough I think I'd prefer it as written--one chili--next time. Having read the reviews it seemed as though some people were mistakenly adding the whole can so I thought two peppers wouldn't be pushing it. It is. Wonderful flavor all around though despite my error in judgment! Also I served it over plain white rice making it a main dish instead of an appetizer. I suspect the pineapple juice contributed as it definitely gave the dish a liberal amount of \"sauce.\" It worked out really well. Definitely a keeper.",
