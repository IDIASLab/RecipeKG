I substituted Egg Beaters for the eggs in an effort to lower cholesterol and used honey butter crescent rolls (what I had in the fridge) which I think actually enhanced the flavor. Set the timer for 40 minutes and in the future will start checking for doneness at 35 as this was getting a little too brown around the edges. Took a bit of time to cut the crescent rolls into 1/2 pieces and I m not sure why they need to be that small so I ll try 1 pieces next time. We did drizzle syrup over the top the texture was moist and not too eggy. This was really easy to make and would be a great brunch item. Thanks CX for an outstanding Sunday breakfast. We really enjoyed it.",
