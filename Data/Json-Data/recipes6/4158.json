My tenderloin was slightly smaller than 1-1/2 lbs and was about 155 degrees when I took it out of the air fryer. A minute or two less cooking time would have been perfect for my piece so keep an eye on that if using a smaller piece than what's called for. The meat was still tender and juicy and the broccoli was delicious. Loved the crust it created in the air fryer. When hubby comments that it's good then it's a keeper! I did cut the black pepper back just a tad and only used a couple dashes of cayenne but it still had a smidge of heat. Perfect for us, we're heat wimps!Thanks, Nikki, for a great recipe that's a snap to prepare!",
