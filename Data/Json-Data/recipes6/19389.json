It also did not look anything like the picture. Mine was very smooth on the surface. I had baked it double the time and it came out the consistency of custard in the middle and with the edges a little thicker. After rereading the recipe I did find I did not follow the instructions I mixed the liquids together first then poured the flour mix into it rather than the other way around. I will definitely have to try this again So I can give it a better rating because I just can't stand screwing up a recipe and I don't think it's a bad recipe.",
