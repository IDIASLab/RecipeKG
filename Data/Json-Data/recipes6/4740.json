I ended up adding more EVOO and used the liquid from steaming the broccoli for the broth. And I substituted Pecorino Romano for the Parmesan! I slow-cooked 2 large chicken breasts in Italian seasonings then I shredded the chicken and mixed with the Pesto sauce and served over Penne pasta.

The cayenne made it too spicy for me so next time I'm going to skip the cayenne. This recipe made a double batch for me since I added additional broccoli.
