I had never tried ginger beer before and it had a spicy kick, so, I was excited about the flavor it would give the pork.  Unfortunately, I didn't taste any of the ginger in the pork.  That being said, we still really enjoyed the pulled pork.  It had a nice smokiness from the smoked paprika and a slight spice from the red pepper flakes.  Very tasty!",
