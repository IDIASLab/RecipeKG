I used a premium quality chocolate and it deserved the rich buttery taste rather than the flatness of the oil. The dough could have also benefited with the addition of a little salt to heighten flavor maybe a quarter teaspoon. I didn't roll them in powdered sugar as I wanted a greater contrast between the cookie and the candy kisses. Very pretty!",
