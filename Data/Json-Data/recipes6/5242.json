My corn was super sweet and gave this chowder great flavor. The cilantro does give some balance to the overall sweetness so I d recommend not omitting it (unless you re one of those cilantro haters out there). The only adjustment I made was to add more stock and milk because I had a pot full of veggies with not enough liquid and I did add some salt. If you prefer your chowder thicker just add a cornstarch slurry to it. Easy enough to make and will be included on my soup-salad-sandwich summer menus.",
