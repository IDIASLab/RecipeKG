I used the advice of previous reviewers and cut back, but there was still too much watery liquid.  I dissolved one vegetable bouillion cube in about a half can of chicken broth.  To this I added about 3/4 cup of sherry.  I used a bag of frozen pearl onions along with fresh mushrooms, fresh rosemary, black pepper and salt.  I parboiled some red potatoes and added them to the crockpot about an hour before serving (I didn't want them to be mushy).  We really liked the way this tasted and I will cook this again.  Like so many crockpot recipes, its presentation was lacking - not the flavor.",

It was easy to prepare: chop and wash vegetables, add liquid ingredients (I used a can of vegetable broth and a can of chicken broth and the cup of sherry), I added the  seasonings and mix everything together in a roaster.  I then put my pork shoulder roast on top of everything.  Good for letting kids help, i.e., adding the vegetables, liquid and seasonings.\n\nBecause my roaster was fairly large I added carrots, and more mushrooms and potatoes.  I adjusted the seasoning (to my taste) to compensate for the extra veggies.\n\nI braised this at 275 degrees for over 6 hours and it was excellent -- hearty, tasty and beautifully tender.  Vegetables were tasty.",

After the dish was done, I poured the cooking liquid into a sauce pan and thickened it with cornstarch mixed with sherry.  I added carrots and garlic.  I really dislike the flavor and aroma of rosemary, and one whole tablespoon of dried rosemary seemed like an awful lot.  I picked up a package of fresh \"pasta\" herbs which included fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme and oregano.  I used several springs of thyme and oregano, and only one of rosemary.  That was plenty to flavor the pork with just the slighest hint of rosemary without overpowering the dish. I would have rated this higher if it weren't for the overuse of dried rosemary.  Otherwise, this was quite good, and my husband and I enjoyed it.",

Whatever cut of pork you chose make sure they aren't TOO lean (very lean meats will come out tough when slow-cooked). We often add a lot more mushrooms just because we like them so much. If I don't have pearl onions I use frozen chopped white onions it's all good. My husband is always requesting this. As a previous poster mentioned there is a good amount of extra liquid/gravy (we like it that way). But keep that in mind - if you don't want much drop the amount of broth and sherry by half. Or you can thicken it to make more of a stew. Whatever you feel like ya know?:)",
