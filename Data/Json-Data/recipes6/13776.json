The first time the crust almost burned before inside done- so the second time I microwaved the inside in a glass bowl for 2minutes to speed up the cooking time inside. I also cooked the pie crust in the oven- I love my crust flakey on the bottom- After the pie crust was lightly cooked I poured the microwaved pie mixture in the pie and cooked till the crust was a nice brown and the inside was done.  Awesome!  I speed up many recipes using the microwave to precook the insides alittle faster. Pies or casseroles or baked potatoes!",

Buttermilk (make your own by adding a tabls. of vinegar to milk and let sit 1/2 hour - same chemical reaction), 2 Tabls. flour,rounded - not heaping, 1 teas. pure vanilla.  Mix/sift together (sifting originated decades ago when flour almost always had mealy bugs in it!!) sugar and flour, add buttermilk, butter, eggs and vanilla. Mix well. Pour into pie shell (hard for the best cook to beat Pillsbury's frig crust - but use a Deep Dish if using frozen). Bake at 400 for 15 minutes. Reduce to 325 for apx. 30-40 minutes. Note: Pie should rise up in the middle - it will fall to level upon cooking. Additional test; shake - should not wiggle in the middle. This pie melts in your mouth and couldn't be easier. Variations: Add some fresh sliced peaches in a round across the top when in season. Or - Toss over some mini chocolate chips after that first 15 minutes. Enjoy whatever version!!",

Also, bake on the lowest rack in the oven. I did this, which allowed it to baked completely through the center, yet to a golden brown perfection. - Then, dust it lightly with powdered sugar.",
