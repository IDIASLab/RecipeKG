                "reviewBody": "My 92 year old neighbor has an orchard with lots of peach trees.  He is always offering me peaches when they are in season.  I canned this recipe for variety, if you know what I mean.  A person can only make so many jars of peach preserves, peach salsa and peach wine, right?  So I made this.  The syrup has a wonderful smell & flavor and the peaches taste great.  Make this as the recipe tells you and you will not be disappointed.  The only thing I'd suggest is that if you have never canned before, pitt the peaches and place the pitted side down in the jar and work your way up (use wide mouth jars if possible).  Another thing you need to know is to get ripe peaches that are freestone.  If they are not ripe, the freestone pits will not let go as easily and the peaches are more difficult to peel as well.  Place them, skins & all into boiling water for 60 seconds then place them into iced water before peeling (same as when you peel tomatoes when canning).   The peelings will come off a lot easier if you do it this way.  Then fill the jars with them. Don't overpack the peaches by trying to shove them down into the jar; it will make them fall apart more after canning.   You can also put a tablespoon of lemon juice into the jar before putting the syrup into the jar. The lemon juice will keep the peaches a nice color.",

Mama always had to buy these and they were quite expensive during our growing up years back in early 60's and up until now; always tried to find them for these two holidays and once opened & kept in refrigerator they would last for a very long shelf life. hard to find them any more so glad to be able to make my own now. again thanks. The peaches we had from the store pickled were canned whole; peeled but still had the pit inside to help hold the peaches intact I imagine but when you ate the peaches did not affect the taste of the peaches by having pit inside peaches. easy to remove at time of eating so still pleasurable regardless how they were canned but I do know they were much prettier to serve whole with a few of the cloves in the juice straight from the jar; we always only put In a little of the juices though to keep from looking dry but were awesome. these could also be eaten next morning on toast like a jam/preserves just make sure too remove all spices and simply smash with a fork to make spreadable..yum!!! toast bread; spread with a dab of butter or can use a bit creamed cheese as a base and then slather on peach spread... OMG!! GIVE IT A TRY FOR SURE YOU'LL LOVE THE SPICYNESS WITH THE CRUNCH OF THE TOAST.GREAT EATING WITH HOT BEVERAGE.",
