I only made half the amount stated because there are only two of us and because my chanterelles were less than two cups. But there was nothing left and we could have eaten more of this wonderfully creamy yet al dente risotto. You could use more chanterelles than stated here or even add other mushrooms I m sure that would be very yummy. Also make sure you don t use that hideous Parmesan powder stuff it will ruin the experience so who ever uses that should not give a bad review.;) I also put some freshly shredded Italian parsley on my portion. My man doesn t like it much but I think it tastes great.",
