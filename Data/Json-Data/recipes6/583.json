I don't think scotch was much different from using Jack but perhaps I will try it with Jack and a little jalape\u00f1o next time.  I loved the fennel flavor with the sweet potato.  It was a southern cooking twist to a couple of root veggies. The bacon, onion and fennel aromas were so nice when starting out. Advice:  Don't let the potatoes get too soft and mix the brown sugar together with the whiskey before pouring it over the veggies. Wait for the sauce to Thicken a bit., If you  like a little \"kick\",  I am sure a bit of diced small jalape\u00f1o would have been a nice touch. I just wouldn't 'add too much so as not to overwhelm the taste of the fennel and sweet potatoes.",
