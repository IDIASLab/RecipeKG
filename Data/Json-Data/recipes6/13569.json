Perhaps success is dependent on the size the tomatoes are chopped (mine were 1/2\" pieces) or how green they are (mine were pretty green certainly not close to orange). Anyway the cooked pie was pieces of green tomato swimming in a watery liquid. They tasted ok although the spices were overwhelming. They were nothing like apple pie. Hoping to try again with some adjustments.",
