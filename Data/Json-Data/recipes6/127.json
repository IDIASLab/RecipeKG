Non the less it is delicious and I know by letting it sit for 2 weeks the flavors will only get better. Another great mustard recipe! Thank you pelicangal...if it wasnt for your mustard recipes I probably would never try to make from scratch! Note: I reviewed this recipe originally as a personal recipe back on March 12 of this year..so I thought I would share my review here as well since it has become published! Kudos to you pelicangal!",

I also increase my processing time up to 20 minutes because my experience  has been that 10 is not long enough to thoroughly  heat the mustard to create the vacuum needed to seal the jar. I use half pint jars.  I also heat my ingredients in a pan on low heat and use a hand blender to achieve the right consistency  and then place hot mustard in hot jars. I love the texture and use it in many recipes. It's got a tang to it . I use 805 beer.  I  make it for my family and friends.  Thank you to the author of the recipe.  I read the reviews on Oktoberfest beer mustard from the Ball canning recipes. I decided to go with this one and I'm  glad I did.",
