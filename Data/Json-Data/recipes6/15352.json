Great little cake cookies that truly is perfect with tea. So simple and so good. Hint- don't substitute the buttermilk or else you won't get the fluffy airy texture. They are unbelievable right out of the oven - I usually devour 3 while still warm. I've also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon for a great variation. Update I substituted regular sour cream in place of the buttermilk in a pinch the cookies turned out divine. A little different from having the buttermilk. The cookie was super-rich and a little denser versus the light airiness you get from the buttermilk. It held up very well and made a slightly thicker cookie. A great variation if you want something toothier.",
