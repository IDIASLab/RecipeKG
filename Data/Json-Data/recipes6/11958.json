But just a note, **they don\u2019t HAVE to be crunchy** In Australia, we are split. Half like them crunchy, half like them chewy. I think chewy only just wins, at least where I\u2019m from. It is said that the women back at home in WWI wanted to make biscuits for the men at war, as they were concerned they weren\u2019t eating well. But as they were on rations, they didn\u2019t have eggs. So this recipe was born. Or so they say. Just remember, these biscuits are great crunchy or chewy!!!",

Also, our first batch was SOOO super dry, we couldn't keep the cookies together at all!  They were falling apart all over the cookie pans.  The taste was good (or what you expect with ANZAC cookies) but all were so crumbly, and big balls as they didn't spread.   So I read somewhere that in Australia the Tablespoon is bigger than here in U.S. (?) and so made a second batch and added more syrup and butter (like 2 more T. butter) and then they spread out like in the pictures.  (Very greasy on the fingers, though, to drop onto cookie sheet because of all the butter, definitely use a spoon.)  But they were what we had expected to get the first time.  Everyone seemed to gobble them up (in my son's 7th grade class.)  Also used Mound's shredded coconut; yummy.",

                "reviewBody": "My 9 year old Grandson and I made these biscuits (cookies) for a class presentation on Australia. We use unsweetened coconut and added a 1/4 teaspoon salt. If your dough is crumbly just add more water 1 teaspoon at a time until the dough holds together. We used a small cookie scoop (about 1-1/2 across) and flattened the biscuits a bit. After baking they came out about 3 inches across. Our biscuits were smaller so we baked them 10 minutes @ 350F. They came out crispy but a bit tough and chewy in the middle. After they cooled for half an hour they crisped up more. We also found them a bit greasy; next time we ll try 1/3 cup butter and add 1/4 cup more flour for a softer cookie (personal preference). UPDATE: I used 1 cup coconut 1-1/4 cup flour 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/3 cup butter on my second attempt; and baked them @300F 13 minutes. They were softer as I had hoped. Either way the flavor of these biscuit is great A Google search found the original recipe on the Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs website. Sharon s recipe is spot on except the original recipe calls for 1 cup coconut. NOTE: The Australian Tablespoon is actually about 1 teaspoon larger than the US Tablespoon; 1 (US) Tablespoon PLUS 1 (US) teaspoon is equal to 1 (Australian) Tablespoon. Adjust teaspoon measurements using just slightly rounded teaspoons (or fractions of teaspoon) in Australian recipes; unless it is noted that measurements have been converted to US measurements.",

I used 1/2 c 1 T butter substituted molasses for the golden syrup and used 2 T of it. I formed the dough into 5 logs and baked for 20 minutes. Then I let the logs cool and cut each log into 6 slices. Then I toasted the slices in the oven at 150 deg for 6 hours flipping midway through. This way the cookies are nice and crunchy and perfect for dipping into tea. Each cookie has 4.5 g fat and 9.5 g carb. With the modifications this is a 5 star recipe.",
