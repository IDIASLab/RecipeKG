If you make it the night before you don't have to rehydrate the onion, just dump it in still dry and hard.  It'll soften just fine.  You can thin it with milk for salad dressing.  For those not in the know, \"Beau Monde\" is a seasoned salt made by Spice Islands brand.  There is a sub for it here on allrecipes but I've never tried it.  You might want to if Spice Islands brand isn't available in your area.  You could sub a different seasoned salt for it, but it is very strongly flavored so the dip won't be the same (not to say bad, just different).",

I'll make this again. I think this would be great with some fresh minced garlic and some diced green onion folded in, too.",
