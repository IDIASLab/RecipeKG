Very good for using prunes that's been sitting around the house for ages. I also wanted to use up my prune juice so I substituted prune juice for the buttermilk and the cake turned out just as good. For the icing I didn't like the idea of putting in a raw egg yolk so I substituted a few more chopped prunes and added more coffee until I got the right consistency. This works great when using buttermilk for the cake because the icing becomes more decorative. However when I make the prune juice substitution I no longer add prunes to the icing for fear of making the prune taste overbearing.",
