Both times I have made this jelly as the recipe states, it has not set up properly, as others have noted as well.  The first time I put it all back into a pan, added 1 more box of powdered pectin, cooked and processed again as stated.  After that it set up fine and was absolutely delicious.  I just made it again (as written) and am again having the problem with it not setting up.  I will add more pectin and re-process as I did before and hope for the same results.  For all first time users of this recipe...this is a fantastic flavored jelly...if you want it sauce consistancy follow the recipe as written.  If you want jelly consistancy use 2 packets of pectin.  And one word of warning...this stuff is addicting!!!  I have also played with the type of peppers...substituting hotter peppers for or adding to the jalepenos.  My latest batch is actually a 4 pepper jelly...Red, Green, Jalepeno and a touch of hablano...mmmmmm!",

I used the inversion method and it worked great but I had to run the jars under hot water to loosen them so they would settle into the bottom of the jar.  I also used 2 cups of red bell peppers, 1 cup of green bell peppers and 1 cup of jalepenos.  The jelly turned out GREAT (but could still be hotter for my taste) and it is the first jelly I have ever made.  I used Sure-Jell fruit pectin if it helps.",

Use Sure-Jell pectin if you can, it keeps the peppers suspended throughout the jelly and sets very well.  Also, cut the peppers by hand, not in a food process or chopper.  Those methods create more liquid and the jelly may not set.  Do not turn the jars as that may disrupt the jelling process.  If you want it hotter, cut back on the red peppers (1/2 cup) and add more hot peppers-habenero, chili, serano, etc.  Just make sure you have a total of 4 cups of chopped peppers.  ",

All four batches set up perfectly. I do love the flavor of the recipe's exact mixture of peppers, but it is not spicy.  I made a recipe using 4 cups of jalepenos and it is spicier.  I will use both!!  One thing I wanted to note for those who are having difficulties with their jelly setting properly-- make sure to bring your mixture of peppers, vinegar and pectin to a good rolling boil (it still boils while stirred) before adding the sugar.  After adding the sugar, return to a full rolling boil (this takes several minutes) and will be really frothy, bubbly as you stir it for exactly one minute longer.  Then, remove from the heat immediately and fill your jars.  I made over 100 jars of jam this week and this method did not fail!!  Good luck-- enjoy your jelly!!!",
