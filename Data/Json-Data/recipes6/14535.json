I used a combination of each for this dish steaming them for a few minutes. I did not mash them as I like a bit of crunch and they still were going to bake for 40 minutes. I did saute the onions to help distribute their flavor throughout the dish more. I balked at the idea of 1/2c mayo but rationalized that I wouldn't be eating it all myself! Did everything else according to recipe except sprinkled a bit of garlic powder over the mixture before baking and subbed crushed caesar croutons for the breadcrumbs. (Safeway's Salad Fixin's Caesar Croutons--in the gold package in the produce dept--are deLISH!) Thanks for the recipe Paula.",
