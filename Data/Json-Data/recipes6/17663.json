A rustic looking dessert rather then elegant.  Small quibble, if you use fresh peaches, HOW MUCH???  I ended up doing two peach spiral layers.  Also, my sides came up slightly higher then the peaches so I filled in with whip cream and sprinkled with toasted almonds.  Was a huge hit, this is a keeper.",

I LOVE this recipe!\n\nI have also made this with other fruit: \n\nGranny Smith apples tasted great, but I wasn't happy with the appearance & texture of sliced apples. The crust baked faster than the apple slices.  Next time, I will chop them and might zap them in the microwave before adding to the crust.  \n\nMangoes - our family favorite so far.  I chopped them coarsely, used the almond flavoring, and sprinkled the kuchen with toasted coconut immediate after baking.  Very pretty presentation and wonderful flavor.\n\nThis is definitely a 5-Star recipe, and a new favorite with my German family. Even without the traditional custard in the filling, they really loved this Kuchen. My only \"tweak\" was to use a 1/2 tsp almond extract because I had no vanilla extract.\n\nNext time, might try adding some ground almonds to the dough, and keep the almond flavoring.  It went really well with the peaches.  The crust would be a great base for just about any other fruit, i.e., apples, pears, even berries.\n\nI used 3-4 very large, fresh peaches from the farmer's market.  I removed the skins by dropping into boiling water for a couple minutes, and plunging into ice water.  The skins slipped right off, and the peaches were easy to slice.",

My aunt gave me her recipe but because I didn't have shortening or cream on hand I went with this one. The final product was very dry and really lacked flavor. My husband who loves the family kuchen didn't even finish his slice. The taste improves as you get to the crust but I was surprised at the blandness. The only change I made was adding 1/4 tsp of rum extract after the vanilla. Seems to me there should have been more flavor. Our family recipe is a little different adding in a filling with the peaches comprised largely of eggs cream and sugar. I would suggest adding a little more sugar to this recipe!",
