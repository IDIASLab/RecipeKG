The bars rose up a bit while baking and smelled like \"bananas\" in my house. They were done in 35 minutes. The bars had a light brown color with flecks of maraschino cherries baked in. I set the bars aside to cool while I made the frosting. Instead of vanilla extract I replaced it with banana extract for more banana flavor. I added the confectioner's sugar to taste and the milk to desired consistency. After I frosted the bars I sprinkled some finely chopped walnuts. The bars were moist flavorful and just banana-y good! The bars look and taste more like a light and airy banana cake (not bread). The banana flavor is pronounced in the bars complemented by the sweet maraschino cherries. I couldn't taste the pineapples and forgot it was even in there. The frosting is light buttery with a banana-y flavor. It is sweet without it being overly sweet. I found the directions baking time and servings all spot on! I think the next time I bake these I will add a little more cherries. This was an absolute joy to bake and eat.",
