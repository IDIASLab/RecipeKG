I used 8oz. fresh white button mushrooms, chopped, in place of the wood ear mushrooms.  I threw some shredded, cooked chicken in half the egg rolls.  I didn't refrigerate the cabbage mixture until cold (didn't leave myself enough time for this step.)  I used an ice cream scoop to put a small pile on each egg roll wrapper and then wrapped and fried as directed.  These had a great flavor - my husband said they were better than he's had in a Chinese restaurant and our 2 1/2 year old son loved them too.  We could have eaten the whole batch (it made about 18 egg rolls,) but we showed some restraint and I froze the rest.  They re-heat great in the oven (still crisp!)",

In place of the cabbage and carrot chopping ordeal, I bought a bag of slaw that was already chopped and contained cabbage and carrot.  I also opted out the pork and replaced it with a 1lb bag of cooked and cleaned small shrimp, so I just added it. With everything at hand it only took the few short minutes to stir fry it all up and stick it in the frig. When I was ready to roll them up I was suprised at how quick and easy that was. While they were frying I made won ton soup to go with them  The recipe made 13 perfect egg rolls.  My family loved them And I will definately make them again. It was a quick and easy recipe., Thanks.",

My changes: ground pork for matchstick cut BBQ pork, fresh bean sprouts for cabbage (about 3/4s were added and cooked, the other 1/4 were added at the last minute for more crunch).  I was making potstickers for this meal, too... they had cabbage and pork... and I needed to use the bean sprouts.  These were better than any I have ever purchased!  And I do have a jar of MSG, so added that, as well.  (My only editorial comment is that SOME people need to get over the \"authentic\" part because MSG is not 300 years old!  Family recipes are adapted over time and MSG is a good addition.  We should just be glad that the recipe was shared with us!!)  My husband loves potstickers but these are MUCH quicker and easier to make, so I fill him up with these and make potstickers as a side dish!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!  IT IS WONDERFUL!!",

I omitted the MSG, and I actually \"fried\" the eggrolls in the cooking spray to brown, then put them in the oven at 425 for a few minutes.  They were crispy & yummy.  Didn't look as pretty as fried, but much healthier.  I also only used egg whites & used the Chinese Pork Tenderloin from this site for the pork & sweet & sour sauce from here as well, but they really didn't need the sauce.  A+ & very healthy with slight modifications.  Thank you for sharing!",

I had sliced roast beef from the deli in my fridge I sliced about 1/2 pound thin and put that in also along with 2 big garlic cloves. Lastly I also used about 1 tablespoon of sweet soy sauce. The cool thing was when I first laid it the pan to cool it was full of water from the cabbage. I said \"Oh I can drain that later\" 2 hours later when I wanted to roll them the water had be reabsorbed by the cabbage! Usually I drain that water and drain all the flavor along with it! Great idea! Thank you for your family recipe I will pass it along to my children as well!",

                "reviewBody": "These were pretty good.  The filling was a little bland so before filling them I added a little bit of powdered ginger.  That helped a lot.  We fried half of them and baked half of them sprayed with PAM.  The fried ones were better and had the restaurant-style texture.  The baked ones were good too just a little too crispy.  However, since we are not big fans of frying food next time we will probably bake them all since they were still pretty good.  These freeze well too.  We did freeze some that were uncooked and baked them the other night.  I would recommend seperating them with parchment or wax paper before freezing otherwise they will stick together.  Thanks for the recipe.",
