So I added more (LOTS more) paprika and a dash of cayenne (since I've never been able to find good hot Hungarian paprika).  That added measurably, but it was still missing a note.  Finally, when I reheated some leftovers, I added some caraway -- and that made the dish shine!  NOTE:  This recipe makes about double what I'd call \"2 servings.\"  YMMV.",

I do not know what Quorn is, so I substituted tofu using the following methodology:  Press a block of extra firm tofu in a kitchen towel to get as much water out as possible.  Cut into half inch cubes.  Coat cubes in a mixture of 3T firmly packed brown sugar, 1T paprika, and 1/4t ground ginger powder.  Bake in 400F oven on parchment until edges get firm.  Mix into recipe where Quorn is used. Also, I used a can of \"Pear tomato strips in puree and basil\", Great Value brand from Wal-Mart, then left out the tomato puree addition. Served over spiral noodles. This was easy, satisfying, not too strange for my husband, so I'll make again.",
