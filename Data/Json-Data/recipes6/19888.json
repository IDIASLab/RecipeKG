I deep fried these in my mini Daisy Deep Fryer (approx. 3 min. per batch) and they came out great. The prep time and the cooking time in the original recipe is overstated. I had these done from start to finish in less than 30 minutes so don't let the time needed to make this recipe scare you. I didn't change the seasonings recommended they were fine. Be sure to cut the meat into 1x1 inch pieces no larger because you want it to be like popcorn steak bites. Overall this is a great recipe!",

Use any cut of red meat you like I've had them with a LOT of different meats including fresh Bear and Cougar steak. As finger food for a game this makes just about enough for two guys. As a meal for maybe 4 servings you need about three lb of twice fried French fries on a platter with the meat mounded on top. I LOVE these. I usually let mine rest in the refrigerator for about an hour after breading and before frying. Season with whatever you like.",
