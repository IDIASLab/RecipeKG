I made it according to the directions having to add in a bit more of everything because I had 5 boneless pork chops.  I used fresh thyme because I had it in my fridge and it was delicious.  Whaat I did a bit differently was after I prepared the chops in a separate skillet, I transferred them right into the skillet with the onions and apples, placing the chops underneath them. I covered the skillet with a piece of foil while I made a gravy/sauce out of the juices that remained from the pork chops.  I added in a bit of brown sugar, butter, and flour and cooked it for a few minutes before adding in about a cup of vegetable broth.  IT turned out silky and smooth.  I then poured the entire contents of the gravy up over the dish in the other skillet.  \nDelicious and very pretty!  I will make this again, probably the exact same way I made this tonight :-)   Thank you for the recipe!",

After browning the chops in a skillet, I transferred them to a casserole dish and covered them with the apples and onions and stuck them in the oven at about 385 until the pork was cooked in the center. Threw on a couple cardamom seeds too for extra flavor. Turned out pretty well. Finishing it in the oven allowed the juices from the apples and onions to really soak into the pirk and make it nice and juicy.",

I used 1 tsp rosemary and just 1/2 tsp thyme and it was just right for me. Other than that this was a nice dish. I even forgot the brown sugar and didn't miss it. I think it would also be good with white wine as opposed to the apple cider vinegar. It didn't say to but I used more oil when I added the pork to the skillet. I used thin sliced pork loin because that's what I had and cooked it just a few minutes per side. Would make again.",
