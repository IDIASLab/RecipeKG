The first time, I accidently left out a whole cup of flour and didn't realize it until I had baked too many to try to fix it.  They came out like crinkly molasses cookies, and tasted great.  The second time, I got the flour right and they stayed in puffed little balls, more like a ginger snap.  So you can pick which you want!  Also, the baking time can be adjusted very liberally.  I've baked them for as little as 7 minutes to get a crisp outside and chewy center, and up to 15 or 16 to get a true ginger snap.  The choice is yours!!",

I like mine a little softer, so I stop baking them just after they crinkle (10-12 minutes.)I took someone else's suggestion and I rolled them in turbinado sugar.  They look very pretty.

The 1/4 cup of sugar listed (before the salt) is used for rolling cookies in before baking them and not meant to be added to the flour mixture...at least that's how I took it to be...also too, may I suggest that you use a fresh box of baking soda when making these great cookies.",

I worried about the amount of sweetener using oil the fact that the baking sheets were to be ungreased etc etc etc. But except for adding 1/2 tsp fresh nutmeg and a scant 1/4 tsp black pepper -- and mixing by hand -- I followed the recipe exactly and the results could not be better!
