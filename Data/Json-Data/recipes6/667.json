I never butterfly/stuff my stuffed roasts. I insert a long sharp pointed knife lengthwise into the roast from each end. Then open it up a bit to make a pocket large enough to accomodate the stuffing. The presentation is so nice that way and it is way easier too! I did not get any useable drippings out of this. I ended up with slightly burnt glaze in the pan so no gravy. I think I will make a seperate gravy with white wine next time. Very nice recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!",

I did substitute a box of Stove Top with my own sauteed' onions & celery for the stuffing but followed the exact recipe for the brown sugar paste that's on top and this was wonderful! I cooked it in a 325 degree oven for 2 hours. I probably should have followed the recipe and only kept it in for 1 1/2 hours because once the meat rests it will keep cooking. There were not enough juices to make gravy but we didn't miss it. The meat was moist and flavorful. The whole family loved it and I'll be sure to make this again.Thank you!",
