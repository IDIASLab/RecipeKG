It ranks one star for the instructions maybe a five on the taste but I\u2019m giving a generous four star rating. \nStep one has butter added with oil, and then an excessive amount of flour with milk, and nothing is mentioned with how this is used. \nDue to the incomplete instructions, I added the cheddar cheese into the milk mixture, and I added the shallots in there too. I then poured this mixture on top of the shrimp topped it with breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese and baked it. I served it on top of a mixture of spaghetti and turmeric spaghetti.",

Perhaps the recipe has been re-worded since the other reviewer made it  Measurements for the rue - 1 part oil/butter to 1 part flour - are traditional.  I found the directions complete and easy to follow.  We both loved it, and when we miss our favorite restaurant at the beach, this is what I make for us.  Very, very good, and on my seafood menu rotation!",
