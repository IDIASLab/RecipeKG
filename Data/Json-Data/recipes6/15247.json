It was a bit on the sweet side so next time I will either leave out the sugar or at least cut it in half. My biggest problem with this recipe was the fact that I could not get it to freeze in my ice cream maker. I finally gave up and put the whole thing in the freezer and after about five hours it was finally done. It may just be my ice cream maker but since I was able to get it frozen by just using my home freezer this would be great for someone that does not actually have an ice cream maker. The first time I made it I was not able to add the full two cups of milk. This resulted in a great taste but the texture was like marshmallow fluff. The second time I was able to fix that problem I added the full two cups of milk and stired it into the whipped topping/condensed milk mixture before I poured it into the freezer. I made a peanut butter cup version for my husband by using ony 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a 10 pack of the individually wrapped Reses Peanut Butter Cups cut into small pieces. He said it was better than the stuff you get at the store or ice cream parlour.",

I just mixed it well and then put it into the freezer. I like that the ice cream stays soft instead of hardening. I think the name of this ice cream should be changed to Sweet Cream because this is very sweet. It tastes like cold marshmallow fluff. I would recommend reducing the white sugar in the recipe. I stirred peanut butter and chopped Reeses's and chocolate syrup into my bowl of ice cream and that helped to mask the high sweetness. If you are going to make this reduce the sugar and then add peanut butter and Reese's for sure.",

At the ice cream shop in the student center they sold York Peppermint Patty Ice Cream. So good. So using nonfat sweetened condensed milk whipped topping and 1% milk I made this in a 2 quart container- I added less milk than called for. I also only added 1/2 x. of sugar. I used half of a bag of peppermint patties cut into small pieces. Its wonderful!!! Next time I will use a whole bag and will leave the peppermint patties in big chunks. Very easy without an ice cream maker but I will have my maker set up next time to try this again. Cheaper than buying Breyers and Im sure healthier. Thank you!!!",
