        "description": "When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.",

I believe the key to not having burnt onions it to bake this in a dish, and not on a baking pan, and being sure to place the onions UNDER the chicken. I put a heavy layer of onions on the bottom (I think I used almost 3 onions.) Drizzled them with a little olive oil & seasoned with salt & pepper before continuing. Then after everything was in the frying pans, I filled in the spaces between the chicken with cut up red potatoes. Baked, covered, at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes then removed the foil and baked a few minutes longer to get that golden color. It was delicious.",

                "reviewBody": "Marinated for 6 hrs. using boneless, skinless thighs. Between Chef John's comment and another reviewer, I figured they would work fine. Trouble is, cooking time should be adjusted.  Boneless cook faster than bone-in.  I took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for (could tell they were done) but they were still a bit dry.  I was also expecting more flavor 'pop' with the ingredients of the marinade.  Might give it another whirl with bone-in.",
