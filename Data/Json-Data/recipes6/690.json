The only changes I made were fewer bread crumbs-about 1/2-3/4 of a cup in the meatballs-always depends on the fat content of the meat; I did add the can of chopped pineapple to the sauce as another reviewer suggested and I think that is a great add-in for this recipe. I put the meatballs in the crock pot when they were done-about medium and I cooked the sauce longer on the stove-about med. heat for 10 mins. or so, stirring continuously. Then I poured the sauce over the meatballs in the crock pot and had them on low for about an hour before serving. These are going to be my go-to appetizer for work parties and other events like that. They are just a bit different so it's not the usual cocktail meatball. They taste great and are pretty easy to make.",

People were upset that I didn't have more and I brought about 60 of them. Many asked for the recipe and loved that it uses jellied cranberry sauce for the glaze. The only thing I do differently is that I put the drained meatballs into a crock pot and pour the sauce over them and heat on high for 1 hour. The crock pot stays nice and hot and they are easier to transport to wherever you maybe going. This will definitely be my go-to potluck dish from now on. Loved it!! Edited on 12-18-15 -- I brought these cocktail meatballs to another Christmas party this year and again the crock pot came home empty.:)",
