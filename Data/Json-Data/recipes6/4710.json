If you want a thinner soup then add more broth & spices and leave the other ingredients 'as is'. Also the cooking time will depend on what kind of lentils you use. Red lentils cook very quickly while brown lentils need to be boiled for a while. If you use red then add the sweet potatoes at the same time as the lentils. If using brown ones then cook first until almost tender then add the sweet potatoes and continue cooking until they are tender. I will mention that garam masala can vary greatly in flavor & heat. Adjust it (and the salt) to your liking at the end of the cooking. I almost always add a bit more salt at the end even if I've used a regular sodium broth and I stir in another 1/2 tsp garam masala as well to make sure the flavor is to my liking.. You can also use any other veggies you like - carrots potatoes -- use what you have on hand. Make it your own! I like to top with a dollop of mango chutney for sweetness and a swirl of plain yogurt to really bring home the essence of Indian flavors. This dish is loaded with power foods plus it's easy & delicious. Enjoy!",

It was VERY good with these additions: Scaled to 10 servings: Omit spinach I omitted \"red pepper flakes\" and used 1/2 tsp ground red pepper from the Indian store. 1 T ground coriander 2 cinnamon bark (about 2\" each) from Indian store (remove before serving) 1 T curry powder 3-4 Tablespoons sugar at the end (this may be a little sweet for others I suggest using 2 T and add to taste) Little bit of salt I blended a few ladles full of cooked lentils and added back to the soup for some thickness. The Lentils will have a crunch they are not overcooked or mushy when you follow cook times on recipe. I really liked it this way. My vegan friend and non vegan husband liked it. I froze what we wont eat in the next 2 days it doesn't contain anything that will curdle so I suspect the freeze wont hurt it a bit. It is definitely better the next day after the flavors meld.",

It's great for us here in Tanzania because all the ingredients are readily available (including the red pepper flakes I carried over from the US!). Love the flavor however if you want a soup you'll have to add liquid as there is not enough broth left after cooking the lentils and sweet potatoes. We happily eat it as a side dish of veggies. We use swiss chard that we grow ourselves as we don't have any luck with spinach. Thanks for the great recipe!",
