Just make sure that you do not cook the meat in the house as I did the first time. The meat will steam in the marinade and then burn in the pan becoming bitter tasting from the sugar in marinades. It makes clean-up a pain to. On the grill it worked fine the next time although I was hoping for a more juicy aftertaste. But I guess when you start with a tough cut of meat marinades can only do so much. It did have a really nice smell on the grilll though and the people I served it to seemed to like it.",
