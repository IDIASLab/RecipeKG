See my photo.  Soaked 3/4 cup golden raisins for 20 min in warm 1/2 triple sec and 1/2 apple juice (liquids mixed and heated on 30 seconds in microwave) THEN made the pudding processed sugar free using 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup Agave Syrup to replace white sugar.  No one could tell...I left part without topping for my diabetic mom.  Also, next time I will use one stick of butter melted in the noodles, not 6 tablespoons-I don't like tiny leftovers.  This is NOT a low fat dish-it is a treat...I'd rather have a small piece of something fabulous than a large piece of blah.\n2004 review: \nThis is the best Kugel recipe I've made or tasted!  I only changed a few things.   I used the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese (I didn't want that extra 1/4 sitting around for me to eat.) I added 1/2 cup of raisins to the noodle mixture after I soaked them in VERY HOT water for about 15 minutes. I changed the topping to:  1.5 cups crushed cornflakes mixed with 1 stick (1/2 cup) of melted butter and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. I sprinkled that on top and then I mixed 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon with 1/8 cup of white sugar and sprinkled that on last before baking. \nIt was great the next day too!!! Eat cold or warm, but best warmed.",
