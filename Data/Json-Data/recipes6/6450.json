I dipped the chicken in my homemade buffalo sauce, rolled it in panko bread crumbs placed it on a plate and sprayed with cooking spray on both sides. Placed  the chicken in air fryer basket. Cooked them for 5 minutes at 400; turned them and cooked 4 minutes longer. Then I drizzled more buffalo sauce over all and served with bleu cheese dressing. \nThat was the highlight of the meal. The kids loved them.",

I used chicken breast tenderloins and I recommend placing them in a shallow bowl and letting your chicken marinate an hour or so before coating them in your breadcrumb mixture.

I\u2019m sure people more experienced than myself had no issues whatsoever, and I made the decision to try it. It came out really good, though, so, it\u2019s all good   I definitely recommend giving it a go!",
