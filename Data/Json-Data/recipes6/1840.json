This one not only tastes good, it rises more than than white-bread-flour recipe I used to make. It is also soft and freezes well. I make my bread on Sunday, then make and freeze my sandwiches for the week. Each day I take one out of the freezer and Friday's is just as good as the one on Monday. You can use any flavor jelly.",

Amazing. Proves how versatile this recipe is. I also swapped out one cup of the flour for white flour, and I didn\u2019t add any vital gluten. Made a tender loaf that still hangs together for cutting. The peanut flavor is not strong, just toothsome. I am going to try making French toast with it too...though it is flat out delish just with butter and a cup o\u2019 something hot.",
