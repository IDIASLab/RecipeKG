I soaked dates as recipe but for about 2.5 hours then gave them a rough chop. Followed recipe but doubled quantities and made mix into 4 x 1lb tins. Baked for about 40 mins Turned out great taste so good and will be even better tomorrow. Flavour reminded me of sticky toffee pudding and I reckon some toffee sauce would go very nicely with a warmed thick slice of this loaf... with ice cream... or cream. Thank you.",
