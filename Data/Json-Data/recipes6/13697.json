I used an 8x8 square glass dish I added 2 tsp. of vanilla (suggested by someone else) I didn't have almond extract so I used amaretto liquer I used an entire 16 oz. can of whole cranberry sauce (also not my original idea) and I added the crumb topping. YUMMO! My husband and I have just about finished this off and I made it TWO days ago. If you put the crumb topping on (1/3 c. flour 1/4 c. brown sugar 3TBSP butter) right away you may have to cover your cake with foil halfway thru baking to prevent burning. Also I think mine went almost a full hour with the extra cran. sauce so be sure to check all the way to the bottom of the pan when testing for doneness. Enjoy and thank you Laura Owen!",

I baked about 5 min less than it called for about 50 min. COOL 10 min. before turning out of bundt pan onto a serving plate. It doesn't need glaze but it would look nice to sprinkle it with powdered sugar or make a light glaze when it cools and is on a plate for serving.",

WOW! It included the streusel topping and slivered almonds on top. She made hers in a 9\" rd cake pan. It is so pretty and you may serve a wedge any size you choose.

Needless to say I was a little nervous bringing a dessert that I had never made or tasted before. Well as you know.......\"NOT TO WORRY!\"......It was absolutely delicious! Nothing but raves from all of us! Everyone wanted the recipe. This will most certainly be on my list of take alongs and any time I am asked to make dessert.
