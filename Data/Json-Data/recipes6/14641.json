The chocolate does not have to be lumpy as mine was not.  I mixed the sugar, cornstarch and cocoa together and then added the milk.  I then heated and brought to a boil, pour 1/2 in the egg yolks, and then back into the kettle and back to a boil.  This will eliminate the lumps.  This is how I make all my puddings, it turns out perfectly and I got rave reviews from all those eating the pie!!",

I then layered the PB and chocolate a few times in custard cups topping them with some of the crumbs and served them warm. DELICIOUS. They were SO rich and sweet and just perfect.
