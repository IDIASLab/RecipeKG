I followed the directions and ingredients but BOTH time my cake out looking like it was not cooked in the middle, it was kinda \"gelled\" or \"solid\".  The first time it happened I thought it was because I took it out of the over a few minutes before the 80 minute instruction. The second time, I left it in about 10 minutes longer than what was instructed.  If anyone has any idea..please let me know.  I also had a temperture thing in my oven to make sure it was at 350 degrees.  This was cooked in a bundt pan both time.",
