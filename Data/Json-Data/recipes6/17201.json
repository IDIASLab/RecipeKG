Every step is worth it, from browning the meat to deglazing the pan.  This hearty and flavorful stew satisfied my family and dinner guests.  Everyone went back for more.\n\nI followed the recipe as written, using merlot for the red wine because I like the rich flavor and Yukon Gold potatoes because I like their taste and texture and they were on hand for the Potato Fougasse (potato bread with olive oil and rosemary) I made to accompany the stew.  They were wonderful together.  Trust your instincts when thickening the stew once it is done.  Some reviews complained about consistency but you really need to decide what it needs for yourself using more or less of a flour/water paste than indicated.  Do what works for you.  (And by the way, if you have extra merlot use it with the flour instead of water to thicken the stew to impart some extra flavor.)",

I added celery and mushrooms, and also tossed some peas in at the very end.  I added a bay leaf and some thyme and a pinch of rosemary. Next time, I might add some tomato paste or diced tomatoes.

Like others, we skipped the onion soup, replaced the water with beef stock, added extra veggies, and added garlic. Didn't thicken - it wasn't necessary. Slice up a tender roast that falls apart in the cooker instead of getting \"stew meat.\" It's just plain wonderful, and after it gets a little gone, just add some corn, green beans, whatever, to make it last even longer.

I should probably rate it 5 stars, but since I slightly tweeked the recipe I give it a four since my rule is 5 stars only if I make no changes.  The only changes I made are to add 4 cloves of garlic, I used 1 cup water and 2 cups Merlot for my liquid  (it still could have used another cup of liquid), but the extra wine added a richness water could not achieve.  I also used more carrots since the pot seemed to be lacking.  Simple changes to suit our taste.  Seasoned just right...didn't add or regret not adding any seasoning.  Kept us warm and satisfied!

(of course my house still smells like stew...)\r\n\r\nI used about 1.25# of meat or so, Lipton beefy onion soup mix, 2 small packs of baby carrots, 2 red potatoes, and 1 onion.  I didn't saute the onions in butter either.  I prepped this the night before, and next morning, popped it in the crock pot.  It cooked on low for 12 hrs (might account for the dryness).  The meat shredded easily.  My fiance thought it was tasty, so I think this recipe is a keeper.  I might add some beef broth next time for more liquid to combat the dryness.  The pepper really gives it a little kick!  I didn't have to thicken the gravy because I had dumped in the flour from the meat.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a successful first crock pot experience... :)\r\n\r\n                    *note - I've made this several times now, and adding the can of beef broth really helps!  From now on, I'll make sure all of my crock pot dishes have enough liquid to cover the meat!  I also have been using sweet potatoes in lieu of regular potatoes...yum!",
