I didn't really read the whole thing until I started making it and that is when I realized there are NO spices in this recipe...NO flavor!! So as I often do I modified it....I added 1 tsp of cinn and 1 tsp of nutmeg...also 1 tsp vanilla...and I used only 2 3/4 cups of flour. I haven't iced any of them yet since I just took them out of the oven...but they are great! Sorry to the person who posted this recipe...I just thought that without spices they would be too bland!!",
