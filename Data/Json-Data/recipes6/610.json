I found the muffins to be good but the icing isn't for me.  It tastes like butter which is unpleasant.  I then made these again today with some changes as the submitter suggests in the description to use alternatives for milk.  I used coconut milk and found they came out a bit better tasting so it is definitely worth trying out as amounts and method are right on.  I also used fat free greek yogurt instead of butter and milk for the icing and it was pretty good.  The recipe as is yields a moist, somewhat dense but not heavy texture, rich in flavour and colour it resembles a pumpkin pie in some ways.  Not too sweet and not really savoury not dry and holds its shape well.  Thank you Michele for sharing your recipe.",

So, the alterations we made were; added 2 TBS (yes that much) of cinnamon and just a little more of each of the other spices, used Evaporated milk instead of regular milk - you used evap. milk in pumpkin pie, so why not in this recipe?!  It absolutely works and remains gluten free.  We also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  The big addition we made, was 1 bag of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips.  Oh, the aroma in the house is amazing!!  The regular recipe sounded so good, but we always try to make it our own.  Kudos to the original recipe!",
