To save time just measure out 1/2 cup and use 1 tbsp of it for the peaches in the second step. These are not meant to be sweet muffins but if you prefer things a little sweeter adjust accordingly.

As another reviewer stated the cheddar sprinkled on top made it hard to separate the muffin liners from the muffins and so they crumbled a little trying to get them out. If I make them again I won t sprinkle cheese on top. I also thought they could use a little more basil it didn t stand out enough for my pallet.",
