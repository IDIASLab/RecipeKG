First off, 3 Tablespoons divided is 1\u00bd Tbsp., yet the first line says marinate the fish in 2 Tbsp. of oil. Secondly, The swordfish was way too tough from being marinated in lemon, which partially cooks it, being fried and THEN finally being boiled in wine.. and it was ALOT of wine. No time limit was stated as to boiling it off before putting the fish back in. We had rubbery swordfish in wine. Next time, I would not fry the fish with the onions and would put it in at the very end after the wine had completey cooked off.",

I used butter beans instead of favas but any meaty bean would work. I also suspect that halibut would work great if you can't find swordfish. Nice work Salvatore! YUM!!!!",
