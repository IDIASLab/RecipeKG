THE PROBLEM-- when I poured it into a coffee filter it did not filter-- at all. I got 2 or 3 droplets. SO... I bought cheesecloth -- and filtered it 7 or 8 times. 2 hours later I thought \"now that I've rid it of most of the slimey milkey substance it's time for the filter.\" NO. So far i've had 1/4 cup sitting in 2 different coffee filters (the cheapest and most porous mind you) and have gleaned 1/8 of an inch of \"clear yellow liquid.\" At this rate it would take me at least a month and a weeks worth of labor to get less than a cup. I don't know what kind of coffee filters they have in portugal... So now I have a gallon's worth of a cloudy (albeit nice smelling) substance that may or may not send my friends to the hospital... Do I bottle it and say \"A Portuguese Baileys?\" I tried everything to make this work and it didn't. I wish the instructions were clearer prehaps and more specific and I feel like an idiot for chosing this ONE because I thought it would be different. Should have made the stupid coffee liquor that everyone else does. At least that would have turned out. I am VERY mortified and disappointed.",

Not wanting to dispose of a second lot without trying something drastic I squeezed the lemon and left it overnight. The following day I noticed a slight change in the liquid surrounding the lemon and decided to try filtering some (After all I had nothing to loose.) The end result is a pale yellow liquid that does in deed look and taste like what it is supposed too. Why did it not perform in the manner that I was told it would prior to squeezing the lemon I don't know. Both times I had kept the mixture stored in a dark place. Your guess is as good as mine. All I can say is squeeze the lemon at the end if all else fails.",

I then put a paper coffee filter on top and attached it with the ring lid. I then flipped it upside down on top of another mason jar.
