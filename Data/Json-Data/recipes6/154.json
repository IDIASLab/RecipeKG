I've used pineapple tidbits and rings cut up to fit instead of the crushed pineapple. Crushed pineapple can sometimes make the cake under it too mushy sometimes.  Instead of putting the batter directly into the muffin pan, I used paper liners which is so much easier for lunches and serving at picnics.  It's a surprise when they take the paper off to eat it!  It's basically sweet enough for me to eat like this but occasionaly I've dusted powdered sugar on top of the cupcakes after slightly cooled.  Oh, and if you're a coconut lover, add a little to the brown sugar before laying in the pineapple and cherries.  This is a great recipe anyway you make it!",

Some people were saying to use pineapple tidbits so to see which would be better I made half with crushed and half with tidbits. The crushed looked and tasted better by leaps and bounds.  Otherwise I made them per the recipe with no alterations of substitutions, which is not like me. Here is my advice - Use parchment paper not wax, they stick worse to wax. Move them to a cool place in the kitchen both before and after inverting them, they easily get \"sticky\" on the bottom (cake side). I found that 20 minutes was not enough so I went about 24 to get them done. I also found it was a pain trying to push down the pineapple while keeping the cherry in the middle and covering the bottom completely. Put the pineapple down and then push the cherry through and down to the bottom to make this a ton easier.",

I made my own cake from scratch but followed this recipe for the instructions with glaze, assembly, and cooking time.  Delicious!  Each little cupcake had just the right amount of caramel glaze and the little tidbits of pineapple were so much easier to eat than the big rings in the traditional recipe.  This one is a keeper!  The kids had so much fun helping with this too.  (I discovered after that the kids used 1 T. of melted butter in each muffin cup not 1 t. maybe that's why it was so good.  :o)",

Used a yellow cake mix (all I had) and a real pineapple that I had that was over ripe. Awesome!! Cleaned pineapple, put slices in a gallon Ziploc and squeezed them into mush. Put in a mesh strainer and pressed the juice out as much as possible, ended up with well over 2 cups. Used juice and pineapple as instructed. Came out perfect!! 13 ppl for Dinner 0 cakes left!",
