They're easy to adapt to what you have in your pantry and perfect to store individually for a healthy grab-and-go snack! Using dried cherries gives the bars a tarty edge!

I'm a graduate student, so I needed something for marathon library days. I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels. I don't keep instant coffee, but I do have Kona beans and a flavored bean that I like. I mixed them up keeping the Kona grounds as the base so the flavored grounds didn't have too much punch. For the dried mixed fruit, I got an anti-oxidant blend. The flavors all work really well together. I was worried that the honey and brown sugar would be too sweet, but with unsweetened apple sauce it is perfect.",
