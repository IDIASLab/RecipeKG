Note: This French toast is high in sodium, primarily because of the cheeses. For a lower-sodium dish, substitute no-salt cheeses if you can find them. You can also try substituting orange, almond or strawberry extract for the vanilla. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robin Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association.",

I served it with a little drizzle of real maple syrup. It's really good but HEAVY. Hubby (who loves french toast) made it through one I couldn't finish mine.
