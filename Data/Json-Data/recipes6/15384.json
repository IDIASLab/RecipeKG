I covered the cookies with green frosting I had left over from icing a cake they really did look like little turtles! My friends loved them. They called me Martha Stewart. Which is kind of weird 'cause I'm a guy. The cookies came out really cakey and they definitely needed the frosting but with frosting they were fantastic! I don't know about the other turtle cookie recipes (hey how many people comparison shop for turtle cookie recipes?) but as far as the genre goes this recipe rocks. It will definitely get you brownie points at a party - no pun intended. Ha ha.",
