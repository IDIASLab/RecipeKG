I used a silicone bundt pan sprayed with Pam, and, for whatever reason, it took 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake. It was awesome! I might add a little more baking powder next time but maybe not. It wasn't dense, it just didn't rise a whole lot. My husband HATES tomato soup, and he couldn't guess what was in the cake. Success! Oh, and I iced it with 'cream cheese' icing (8 oz soft neufchatel cheese, 2 TBS soft butter, maybe 1\u00bd cups icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp lemon extract, maybe 1 or 2 TBS milk). Fabulous!

My grandmother used to make this cake many years ago and to hold with tradition I used 2 19fl oz soup cans. (wash remove the label and grease well). Fill to just over 1/2 to allow for rising. When cool use a can opener to open the bottom of the can and press the cake through. Makes it easy to slice. I also made my own self-rising flour by adding 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt for every cup of all purpose flour.",

I'll be making this recipe again without the 1/2t salt and probably use low sodium soup and unsalted butter. I think the cinnamon should be increased to 1.5 or 2t for those who love the extra spicey version. The overall flavor was very good. I baked this in a tube pan for 30 minutes. It turned out light and moist. I frosted it with a chocolate cream cheese icing. This is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing Debbie.",

I used whole wheat white flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt because I don't keep self-rising flour on hand. I cut the sugar down to a scant half cup. I soaked my raisins in unsweetened hot chai before adding it to the batter making sure to drain it well before adding it not only to \"plump\" them but to also add a little more spice. Because I wanted to add a little more fiber I threw in a half cup of shredded organic carrot. I got twelve big muffins out of this recipe that smelled amazing while baking. 350 for a little over twenty minutes and they were ready to go. I always like tomato soup muffins better the next day so they're great today but they'll be even better tomorrow.",
