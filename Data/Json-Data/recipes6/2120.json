Although I suggest you pull it off the burner after simmering in low for about 20-30 min, put in fridge to cool down and then see how thick it comes out. My first attempt I reduced it way too much, but the taste is very darn close, good job with the recipe! I my self have used this recipe as a base for my own rendition of this sauce, and used honey jack instead of jack Daniels, and added some cinnamon so it was not too similar to T.G.I. Fridays original jack Daniels sauce. No one likes a copy cat, haha",

I think it made it a little spicer the T.G.I. Friday's.   I think maybe less cayenne pepper would make it more like the restaurant sauce. I may not put in any cayenne pepper next time. I think it might be ok without it. I'm going to try that this weekend for Christmas finger foods. Cover chic-fil-a's nuggets with the sauce. If also didn't do the garlic like it stated. I'm too impatient to cook garlic. I bought garlic paste instead and urged out the same.  Make sure when you're simmering the sauce that you have medium bubbles. (Too small won't simmer right, too large will probably tasted burnt.)  Follow Ben's changes and a few of my suggestions and it turn out spot on. He did perfect the recipe!",
