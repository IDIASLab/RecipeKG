I proofed the yeast with the slightly-cooled scalded milk and sugar for ten minutes then added the cooled water shortening egg and then gradually added the dry ingredients. I did need just bit more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook almost another full cup. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?) covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400 for 12 minutes was just right. I ate one right out of the oven and I have to say I'm not a fan so far. This is not my favorite roll recipe. It was a slow riser and kind of a cranky dough to work with. The rolls have a consistancy of beer bread which is fine and dandy if that's what you're making but that's not what I was expecting. Plus there's almost NO flavor in these rolls at all aside from salt. I think if I'd used melted butter instead of shortening I think the outcome would be more favorable. Even brushing them with butter didn't make much of a change. I'm really disappointed. I'm sure these rolls were fabulous for others but not for me. It was just okay.",
