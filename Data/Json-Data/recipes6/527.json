                "reviewBody": "Kudos to the submitter(s) This Colorado Trio for the catchy fun and timely name they gave their chili. It s an obvious attention grabber and it works. It s so much more creative than the (yawn) The Best Chili in the Whole Wide World or Easy Peasy Chili. And chili is certainly appropriate for a Presidential Debate to keep muss and fuss to a minimum. It was also interesting for me to try since it was different than how I generally make it. Individual tastes vary of course but for me this was good not great. First in defense of the recipe I couldn t stay true as I was unable to find ranch-style beans so I improvised with suggestions I easily found on the internet. The can of diced green chilies was a new addition and while it contributed a flavor kick I found it too BIG of a kick I could see reducing that amount and maybe filling in with green bell peppers. The broth was different for me too and I m sort of indifferent about it. Where my taste buds had an issue was with the oregano I don t generally add that to chili and I guess I could like it- but two teaspoons was way overkill for me. Submitter is correct this is an easy basic chili recipe that can be modified with changes or substitutions or to include favorite add-ins. I appreciated the new and fun cooking experience especially for tonight s final and important Presidential Debate.",

                "reviewBody": "Best chili I've ever had/made. Being a incredibly novice TEENAGE male cook I was a little cautious about how something like chili would come out first time from scratch. A tradition in our family: chili on Halloween so I wanted to make it from scratch. No flavors clash and unlike Nana I actually used MORE oregano (I used ground the ingredients didn't clarify which one to use) and it tasted just as well. One little flaw and while it's not really anything bad it's worth taking a note: the ingredients stick to the bare minimum. If you like something such as onion (like me!) you will want to add A LOT. I ended up adding about 35 oz of tomato and a whole onion half. Plus the recipe is not too spicy so that's somewhat good. Another note is that I replaced those nasty ranch beans with kidney and black beans and this was the final result. Pros: -Incredibly easy to make just mix it all together. -SO GOOD. My whole family plus two friends said it was 5 s. -Time to make is great; once it's boiling it's done. The hour wait isn't really needed. -Pretty mild for little kids or non-fans of spice. -Simply a good looking meal. I'll be uploading a picture of mine. -I didn't add cheese but I bet it would be great with it. Cons: -After waiting the hour most of the liquid was gone. I suggest either add some water or don't boil for TOO long. -Wasn't too spicy which I would've liked.",
