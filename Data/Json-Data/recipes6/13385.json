Since fresh peaches are only available for about a month in my area, I bought frozen sliced peaches, defrosted and well drained in a colander.  Pretty good, but not quite as tender as fresh peaches.  The meringue crust puffed up somewhat while baking so after it cooled, I just piled everything up on top.  Does not come out of the pan cleanly, but who cares?  It's delicious.  One recommendation:  make this to serve enough people to clean it up in one or two sittings, I noticed by the next day the peaches were starting to drain and make the crust a little soggy.",

Two suggestions: 1st: slightly spray pan with PAM before scooping in the egg mixture. 2nd: I sprinkled the peached with a bit of cinnamon sugar before adding the whipped cream topping (coolwhip was great) I'm going to make it again but for a larger crowd and will try doubling the recipe and putting it in a 9X13 pan instead.",

I wasn't sure how done the meringue was supposed to get just browned but still creamy like a meringue pie topping or more toward crisp? I assume it is supposed to be more crunchy since that's how it turned out with the 35 minute cooking time. My peaches were not very ripe and I had to sugar them so they were very juicy that didn't do the meringue much good. I also found the toasted almonds to be too strong a flavor in the crust. All in all I don't think I got a very good dessert this time around but it's worth working on and trying again. Maybe I would leave the almonds out next time. And hope for riper peaches.",
