The sauce is wonderful without it but the nutmeg really takes it into the realm of Alfredo for me. Also I stirred the nutritional yeast into the sauce instead of putting it on the top for aesthetic reasons. LOVE this healthy alternative great with some grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. I will DEFINITELY make again!",
