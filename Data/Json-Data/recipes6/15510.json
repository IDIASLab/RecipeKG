When I tasted the completed sauce it just didn't work for me. It was overly tangy from the white vinegar. At this point I added a little more sugar and worchestershire sauce and finally some liquid smoke to give it more of a barbecue flavor. I thought the flour was a little strange. My son enjoyed this and had seconds so this gets 4 stars.",
