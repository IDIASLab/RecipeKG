So I guess when you use a 1/2 cup or so of olive oil in regular pesto that is a lot of calories (& I love lots of pesto:) I used a touch of chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth & no additional salt. Not sure if I needed the broth or if it was the Ricotta in this recipe that made my Chicken & Pasta Pesto dinner taste better than usual! I served the Chicken Pasta Pesto w/ grilled red pepper strips on side. Easy & Nice! Everyone loved it Thanks!",
