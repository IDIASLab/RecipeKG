The only bad thing was that it took forever to bake at the recommended heat since I'm at high altitude; next time I'll try it about 25' hotter. On the other hand the slow baking ensured that it baked evenly all the way through - no gooshy middle. Another idea (specifically for the holidays) is to use just red or red and green candy pieces to make it look more appealing; one of the other reviews for this was right - the multi-colored candy shells makes them look funky. By the way if you have a mixer use it! Mixing this by hand takes a lot out of your muscles.",
