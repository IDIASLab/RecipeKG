While I am not originally from Arkansas, this is where I have spent the past 20 years. With the exception of the potatoes and onions, all other veggies came from my homegrown Arkansas garden. I served this with Arkansas caught trout but it would have gone nicely with any protein. The only thing that didn't work for me is that it took a lot more than 2 tablespoons of bacon grease to fry all of the ingredients in a skillet. I keep bacon grease on hand so it was not a problem for me but if you don't you might want to plan accordingly. The bacon grease gives the entire dish a nice smokiness and each ingredient absorbs it in its own special way as not to overpower. Not the healthiest side dish but it was a nice treat and one I will make often in the summer when my garden is in full bloom. I'm thinking fresh green beans and banana peppers in the mix would work great too!",
