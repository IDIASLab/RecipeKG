Hubs had roast chicken for supper and I had...cake.  After one taste I just couldn't put the fork down and ended up cleaning the plate to the last \"stick to your fork\" crumb.  After that I just had no desire for my chicken dinner! This cake is everything you'd want a good old-fashioned chocolate cake to be - fluffy, moist and chocolatey.  It's just right in every way, just what you'd expect Grandma to put before you with a tall glass of milk.  Easy to mix up and satisfyingly delicious, it just doesn't get any better than this.  Very much like the \"Black Magic Cake\" from this site.  Instead of the hot water and instant coffee powder I used a cup of strong brewed coffee. (A cup for me and a cup for the cake!). Other than that, I strictly followed the recipe.  My 9\" layers were done in 28 minutes so watch the time closely! My only criticism of this recipe is that I didn't find simply greasing the pans adequate - I had  a little trouble getting the cakes to release from the pans so I'd suggest flouring them as well.  I frosted the cake with \"Coffee Butter Frosting\" which proved to be a perfect choice.",

I have made sooooo many similar chocolate cakes before I just thought this one would get a regular average raction. Most said \"this is the ultimate chocoalte cake!!\" My brother said it would be perfect for a wedding cake! The texture was so perfect. A slight crisp on the outside chewy and chocolatey on the inside yummy! It was very easy to take out of the pans.(I did flour the pans as well). Also very easy to cut each cake in two to make four layers total. I filled two layers with chocolate ganache and one layer with marshmallow cream cheese icing and topped with coffee frosting from this site. I did double the coffee but used decaf to make it more child friendly or suitable for non-coffee drinkers and added a splash of vanilla. The flavour came through perfectly. For a hard to please family let me tell you this cake was truly awesome! Thanks for sharing the recipe:)!!",
