The house smelled wonderful when these potatoes were roasting, but when I checked at 20 minutes, they looked  very dry, so I did give them another little drizzle of olive oil and a stir.  Unfortunately, we really couldn\u2019t taste the lemon at all.  We love roasted potatoes, and these still were good enough that I\u2019d make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
