I made it into rolls and used my breadmaker to do the dough. The rising times are very long--wasn't sure if that was for a reason or not. It can take that long for me if I just leave the dough out but if I put it in the oven with the light on it doubles in about 1/2 hour. I didn't use clarified butter--just regular margarine and they were fine. The baking times seem long but it did take about 1/2 hour at 400 for my rolls to bake. I halved the recipe and made 8 rolls. Thanks for sharing!",
