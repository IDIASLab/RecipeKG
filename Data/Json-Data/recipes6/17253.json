I served it with a fried egg ontop and sprinkled it with bacon salt and green onions as you can see in my photo! We loved it!",

The cakes were so tasty. I used 1 TSP of honey instead of sugar like someone else suggested. I also used 1 cup of cold lowfat buttermilk. I just mixed everything together -- although I did whisk the egg white. I cooked them like pancakes on an electric griddle -- went very fast. The children (9 and 11) were able to turn the cakes on the griddle -- they had a blast. My husband raved about them and seemed so pleased. Thank you EDSELS1959 -- we really enjoyed this recipe. GML",
