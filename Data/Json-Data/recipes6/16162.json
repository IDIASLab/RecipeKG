After I made this, I couldn't wait for him to try some.  Well, as I thought, he couldn't keep his hands off of it.  When I told him that I made it, he wouldn't believe me.  I actually had to show him the recipe in order to convince him that it wasn't store bought. Here are a few things that you might like to know about this recipe. First of all be sure to use all of the baking powder, stir it in quickly and then pour it into the buttered pan. Make sure you just pour it into your pan, do not spread it around. This recipe is great, but if you want the candy even lighter, be sure to butter the pan all the way up the sides and then put the candy into the oven at 200 to 250 degrees right after you pour it into the pan for ten minutes and then decrease the temperature to 170 degrees for another ten minutes. The candy will puff up and fill the entire pan. It is a good idea to use a metal pan or one of those flexible pans. This makes it easier to get the candy out when it cools. Thanks Debbie, for sharing this recipe with us.",

                "reviewBody": "Perfect!  It is also called fairy food, seafoam, sponge candy, honeycomb, hot air candy, etc.  After 8-10 failed batches, I finally found the way to success:  If you don\u2019t have a high quality DIGITAL candy thermometer, don\u2019t even try this.  The brand I use is CDN.  Previously I had tried a cheap analog thermometer and/or testing in cold water, but the candy cooks so quickly that by the time the thermometer registered the right temp (or a sample formed a brittle thread), the candy had already cooked to a much higher temp.  It burned EVERY time I tried these methods.    Before starting to cook the candy, prepare:  Line your pan with non-stick foil.  Measure and sift baking soda.  Make sure your pan is large enough, as the mixture will foam a great deal after you add the baking soda.  Use a heat-proof silicone spatula for stirring the candy mixture.  Cook only at medium heat or lower; higher will cause the candy to cook too fast and it will burn.   Be ready; the SECOND the candy thermometer registers 295\u00b0 (300\u00b0 risks burning), slide your pan off the burner and add the baking soda.  Stir quickly, but be sure to incorporate every bit of the soda.  (It\u2019s nasty to get even a teeny bite of pure soda!)  Pour into the nonstick foil-lined pan as evenly as you can, but resist the urge to spread it.  It will fill in the empty spots as it cools and settles.  Score cooled candy w/ a serrated knife, then place into a Ziploc bag and break.  Pieces will be irregular in shape.",

We make for Christmas, but it takes 4 - 5 tries to get 2 - 3 good batches.  Well, this year I went back and read all the reviews and made some changes and ended up with 2 perfect batches for 2 tries!!  Per Lisa K, we sifted the baking soda, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (in place of 1 cup white), used parchment paper to line the pan, put in 225 degree oven for 10 min after we poured into pan, then lowered to 170 for 10 min more (amazed it continues used to puff up), and lastly scored with a knife and then broke by hand into (mostly) perfect pieces (did try the pizza cutter but got very crumbly results.  Thought I would put all these tips in one place.  I'm so excited I don't have to go through numerous ruined batches to get the couple of good ones I need for the holidays.  This truly is a family favorite and want to thank everyone for the great tips!",

For the person who said it smells like campfire marshmallows burning; you are probably cooking it on too high heat.

I greased my GLASS (Bc it's what I have) baking pan well, over every crevice, and had everything all ready to go and in it's place when I started cooking the candy. You want to cook it LOW & SLOW. I'm talking med low heat, it will take a LONG time. Find something else to do while it's cooking., and leave it alone! I used only a cheap candy thermometer because it's what I had, and I found that my candy was ready before it reached 350 degrees. I used the cold water test. That's a better indicator of when it's ready then strictly going by the temp (again,in my opinion. I mean, what did our moms and grandmother's do without candy thermometers?). Also, I too used melted semi-sweet chocolate with just a touch of shortening in it in place of the choc conf coating.",

It was too big for my dish and ended up touching the sides, which made it extremely hard to remove from it.  I didn't even bother adding the chocolate coating.  Perhaps some of these things are my fault (I've never been an excellent candymaker) but I didn't like the recipe anyhow.",
