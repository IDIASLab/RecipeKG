My biscuits were a bit hard/dry so next time I'll use a bit of something else mixed with my whole-wheat flour and maybe add a little herbal seasoning into the biscuits. The seasoning of the stew was fantastic! I didn't cut the yam quite as small as I'd like so the pieces were not as cooked as they will be next time. Also couldn't find a turnip so used a pasnip instead. Very yummy!",
