I made a few minor modifications: I marinated the chicken for 20 minutes in a 1 tablespoon dry sherry, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and a clove of garlic (minced).  I also added garlic powder to the sauce and omitted the MSG.  I wanted to add a vegetable so I steamed broccoli and mixed it in when I added the sauce to the cooked chicken. Delicious!",

The only thing I did differently was put about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro, two garlic pressed cloves and more red pepper flakes.  Awesome flavor!!!! My family loved it!!!The chicken came out so moist and tender, it was not dry.  I will definitely add to my recipe box.",

I also used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I s&p'd the chicken thighs browned them over med. high heat in the olive oil til they were cooked through then moved them to a plate. Mix the soy brown sugar lime juice and zest and a dash of ground red chile pepper instead of crushed red pepper and add to the skillet scraping any tasty bits from the bottom. Added the chicken back in after the sauce had slightly reduced and allowed the chicken to warm back up a bit basting with the sauce. Also made the couscous using homemade chicken stock some dried cilantro (had it on hand already) and 2 cloves \"microplaned\" (or finely chopped) garlic. Do yourself a favor and don't forget the fresh lime wedges when serving they give such a fresh bright flavor to the chicken. This is such a flavorful dish! Thanks for sharing!",

The only changes I made were as follows: 1) I added a little more red pepper flakes (personal preference); 2) I added a pinch of kosher salt and ground black pepper to the chicken while it cooked (I don't use MSG); 3) I used basmati rice instead of couscous as that is what I had in my pantry and I cooked it in chicken stock instead of vegetable broth. The next time I make this and I most definitely will I will cut the chicken breasts into strips instead of chunks because while the chunks make for a prettier presentation strips will cook quicker. I will also make a point to get vegetable broth and couscous. Thanks for this keeper!",
