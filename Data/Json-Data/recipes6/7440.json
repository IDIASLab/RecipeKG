My 2yr old daughter loved them as well. We had it for dinner...very filling! Quick and easy and a quick and easy clean-up too. I followed the recipe to the exact and they turned out perfect. I put them in the oven on broiler/hi for about 5 to 6 minutes. Next time I will serve sweet potato fries with it on the side. Thank you for the recipe!",
