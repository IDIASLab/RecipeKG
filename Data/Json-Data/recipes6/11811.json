I just rolled the dough into 12 equal balls and pressed them into the bottom and then spread the filling over the top. I've made these once with pecans and once with walnuts. After the two times baking this I've come to the realization that the crust is bland. But the filling is so good you can't tell. Next time I try this I'll use store bought pie crust. I think it's easier and will probably taste alot better. That being said they were great! With pecans it really tastes like pecan pie and you really can't tell the difference between the walnuts and pecans.",
