I went to my local resaurant to get a quick dinner and mentioned that I had been baking all day and I did not feel like making dinner. I told them I make biscotti and cookies. The owner asked if I sell the biscotti and I told her no I give it away to family and friends. She asked me to bring some in today and if shel liked it she want me to make her some for an up coming party. She called me back about 15 minutes and said she would pay me 50.00 if I made her two dozen. I gladly accepted her proposel and I will have them done tomorrow. Just goes to show this is an excellent recipe. By the way she is Italian from Italy. Everyone should be so lucky to make and share this recipe with everyone! Bon Apetit!",

I also toasted the almonds.\nAlso, I spread half of the biscotti with\nmelted chocolate (only one end) and half of those I sprinkled with toasted finely chopped almonds.   I left the rest plain \nand have been dunking these in my coffee.\nI plan to take them to relatives we are staying with over Thanksgiving,, we can \nhave them with coffee on Friday,,,if there are any left to take!  Next time I will try to make them a little longer and wider.  However, they break easily, so maybe I will add more butter and more melted chocolate to make them even more rich and chocolaty, not so crisp.  I love experimenting,,,",

It will quickly become moist. Also I used a very sharp knife for cutting. Sawing didn't work for me...it was breaking the cookies and making a mess.
