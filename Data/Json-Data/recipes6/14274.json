I also accidentally found out that if you use vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk, applesauce instead of oil, and cut out the sugar, it's a pretty good low fat, low sugar treat. Better if it sits for a day so the natural sugars can absorb. I've tweaked this recipe a lot and no matter how I make it it's wonderful! Thanks, Rose!",

For a simple topping, mix together 2 TBLS. each finely chopped nuts and granulated sugar with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a generous dash of nutmeg.  Sprinkle on batter before baking and press lightly with the back of a spoon.  This topping gives the bread a sweet crunch ~ delicious!!  Thanks, again, for sharing!!!!!!!",

This may satisy the palate of one who is used to eating out and eating processed foods, but if you are a down-to-earth, cook-everything-from-scratch kind of person, this recipe is not for you.  Too sweet, crisp sides (due to the high level of sugar), and not a real banana flavor. It didn't peak and crest, but remained kind of flat (I'm guessing from the lower heating 325 for 1 and 1/2 hour instead of the standard 350 for 1 hour).  It has taught me a lesson though . . .to stick with what works!",
