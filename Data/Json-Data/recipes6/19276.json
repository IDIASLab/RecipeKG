When making the sauce alway mix equal amounts of sugar and can milk ( mix them with garlic powder to taste) mix well then add vinigar 1 tlbsp at a time but still stir slowly keep adding vinigar by the tlbsp till thick.I also like to eat mine on tortilla wraps with some greenpepper added to everything else.You can also make a pizza with this meat.Use a pizza crust spread sauce all over then put some meat on it springle with onions and tomatoes and top with mos-cheese and a bit more sauce.Heat till cheese melts and enjoy. If you freeze the meat cut it up first and put a few slices between freezer paper. then you can take out what you want when you want it.",

This recipe is good but try this for improvement; for the meat add a teaspoon of oregano for the sauce use 2 tablespoons of vinegar and also add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. Don't use a jar...add the vinegar last and quickly and don't stir too much this will make it thicker. No this is not pizza corner but my is it a good fix:)",

It is a strong herb but gives you that authentic taste. The only suggestion I want to make is about the sauce. If you are like me you don't want to wait for the sauce or when I order out they never give you enough. Instead of the evap. milk and sugar use a can of sweetened condensed milk. Add the 1/3 cup of vinegar and a pinch of garlic powder. Whisk it all together and put in the fridge until ready to eat. DO NOT skip the step of browning the meat in a skillet it adds so much to the overal taste. If you've never had this before try it it will become a family favourite.",

Add 1/4 C of white vinegar and wisk it quickly but not too much (10-12 strokes is perfect). let it set in the fridge for 10-15 minutes and voila... Donair sauce that you can literally stand a spoon in. This sauce keeps longer than the standard and will not separate like the regular sauce. Enjoy!! A very important step in the meat prep is to run it through a food processor or grinder three times. This makes a more homogeneous loaf that's easier to slice. More pepper is a good idea as well (up to twice as much.)",

There are some adjustments to be made as other reviewers have noted. The sauce seems particularly odd to me the taste just didn't sit well with me and I tried everything to make it taste better! I think plain yogurt or taziki would be better. The meat needs alot more spice and herbs. However this recipe gave me the new idea to make my own 'lunch meat' with homemade meatloaf that I can freeze in individual slices Thanks!",
