I had some mini gingerbread men and christmas tree sprinkles and with this addition they looked beautiful. These squares require patience when cutting them in order to get the perfect looking square. I froze mine slightly prior to cutting it. I also did not have a food processor but i used my pampered chef chopper and it did the cherries and nuts perfectly. Great addition to my christmas baking.",

So sweet my husband said it made his teeth \"tingle\".The shortbread base seemed overdone I would suggest not waiting for your crust to get to the light brown stage in the first baking step just go with the 12 minutes realizing that it's going to cook for another 25 minutes. You must definitely wait until the bars are completely cooled to frost or it will be a mess. There is another recipe on this site that I like a lot called \"Pink Ladies\" that uses a similar frosting for a chocolate base I think I'd like to try and combine parts of each of these recipes to have a chocolate base with cherry topping.",

My Sister inlaw has been making this recipe for over 18 years that I know of dont know where she origionally found it but it is a delicious cookie..my favorite! We also add coconut to the frosting sometimes. Its best to keep these refridgerated after they have been frosted cover them with plastic wrap and they will last for several days...if they arent eaten up first! =) Mine dont last but a few days..cause they are so yummy!",

One tip I have is to make sure not to process the cherry mixture in the food processor more than a few seconds you just want the cherries to get a little chopped up. I made 2 alterations one was that I forgot I needed the cherry juice and dumped it out so I just used water in place of it to make a white frosting. The other is that my family doesn't really like nuts so I just left them out. The bars are pretty sweet especially with the powdered sugar icing but they are sooo good and have a great texture with combination of the crust and the cherry layer. Overall a definite winner. Try this!",
