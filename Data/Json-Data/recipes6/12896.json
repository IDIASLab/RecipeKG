I used just a bit more sugar afterall they are butter cookies not sugar and used vanilla instead of almond extract and instead of chilling the dough I made little balls and smashed them with the bottom of a sugared cup they baked well and my family loves them!

They do not spread so u can put a lot on one pan.the dough is easy to work with! They have a simple taste like a butter cookie. They are very good. Absolutely perfect with the cookie icing on this site. The cookie was not super sweet but with the icing (which hardens to stackability) it gives it the perfect level of sweetness. Thanks for this recipe!! Very yummy! I like them even w/o icing. You could have them plain w/ tea or something. the cookie comes out white pretty for decorating!",

It also doesn't make a whole lot of cookies.
