I used smaller (approx 5 in. diameter by 1 in. thick) pieces of the dough cut into pie wedges for nice bite-sized pieces.  There was way too much baking powder in this recipe, making it taste 'salty' and not enough sugar or lemon flavor (and I followed the recipe exactly).  I will probably try this recipe again, but with more lemon zest and sugar; less baking powder.  Consistency was good and it was relatively easy to make and has some healthy ingredients too.",
