It came out perfect the best consistency of any I ve made! I was a bit intimidated by the topping recipe but I m glad I tried it. It was easier than I expected came out perfect and completely changed the experience of eating this delicious dessert. The cheesecake itself is very rich and dense but the topping adds a light creaminess that allows you to come up for air and then dive back into that intoxicating richness. Banana flavor was not overpowering but definitely present. Everyone loves it! I will make this again and again.",

This made a nice thick and banana flavored cheesecake. I did not have any banana liqueur so I am sure that the flavor would have been even better with that. I would make a few changes the next time I made this. I would add a double layer of vanilla wafers and greatly reduce the amount of whipped cream in the topping. I felt like I could not taste the pudding after folding in the whipped cream. Also I would add pieces of walnuts somewhere else in the cheesecake because they are not that noticeable in the crust. Overall a great recipe-it was devoured at a potluck I went to.",

The flavor was good but the texture didn't seem like cheesecake to me. The banana made it less smooth and creamy than I'd prefer although it could have been that I didn't mash the banana smooth enough. Not exactly what I'm looking for.",
