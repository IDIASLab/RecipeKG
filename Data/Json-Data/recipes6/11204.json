Unfortunately over the course of several moves I lost the cookbook and for the life of me couldnt remember the exact amounts.  I thought it lost forever until I came across this.  \n\nExactly the way I remember it except I always made it with Jim Bean, and instead of flour I dust my bundt pan with cocoa powder.  I also always let it cool completely in the pan set up on a wire rack before trying to turn it out.  Usually that will keep it from sticking but if not I slice it up, arrange them nicely and dust a little powder sugar on top.  ",

I followed the recipe to the letter except for increasing the amount of rum to 1/3 cup. Initially I was concerned about the runniness of the batter and thought maybe the amount of coffee mixture was way too much but it turned out quite nice. Baking time took about 15-20 minutes longer than stated and I did increase the temperature to 180 otherwise would have been in the kitchen all day! I let the baking pan rest for about 15 minutes before turning out the cake and it came out without breaking except for a small portion on the top which I covered up with frosting anyway. Hubby loved it - he loves anything with chocolate - nice served with dollops of thick cream. I will make this again",
