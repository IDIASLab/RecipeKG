If you have peanut oil, substitute it for the vegetable oil too. It has a more complementary flavor for this recipe. Also, this salad is really good without chicken as well. I served it as a side dish to roasted chicken instead of tossing the chicken in it. I used less of the dressing this way, which cut down on fat and calories too. Overall, great recipe!",

Instead of using bok choy, I used a package of pre-shredded cabbage, a handful of bean sprouts in place of the snow peas and slivered almonds instead of the sunflower seeds.  I added a splash of sesame oil to the dressing for extra flavor.  The dressing was really good.  I only used 1/4 cup of oil and that seemed ample enough.  Mine did get a little soggy after sitting a while so I suggest using the dressing over individual servings if you don't plan on eating it all in one sitting.  Will pass this one on.",

I needed it to be especially easy and quick, so I used fully cooked rotisserie chicken from my supermarket deli and cut it up while the noodles and nuts were cooking. Instead of a 1/4 Cup sugar, I only used 2 TBS. and it was just right. I also added about a cup of shredded coleslaw. Adding 1/4 Cup each of sesame and peanut oil, instead of 1/2 Cup vegetable oil, made the dressing very authentic. My husband loved it. I'll be making this again. Thanks! :)",
