I ran cheerios through the food processor to get a similar consistency to oatmeal and used that in place of the oatmeal. I cut the honey down to a quarter of cup because of this. I used almost a tablespoon of cinnamon. I also baked it for an additional 15 minutes. It came to amazing! The crumble was so good!
