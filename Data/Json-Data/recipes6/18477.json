The stuffing itself tasted okay but it pulled away oddly from the mushrooms which managed to have no flavor at all. The textures of the two elements were completely incompatible. I wonder if adding something like an egg to the stuffing would improve the texture? In any case I'd rather eat more traditional stuffed mushrooms.",
