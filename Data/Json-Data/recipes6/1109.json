I DID adjust the baking time as I was using a traditional lard pastry crust and I wanted to be sure it cooked through. I baked at 425 for 15 mins and then down to 400 for another 5 mins. The pastry was golden brown and the filling nicely set - consistency of jelly not runny. Thank you so much for posting this traditional French Canadian dessert! Grandma Watts would be proud!",

These actually set a bit more than that but the flavour was divine. Will make again for a Canadian treat to share with my Aussie friends.",
