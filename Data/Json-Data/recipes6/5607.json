I'd suggest the following changes: 1 can of HOT green chiles instead of 3 1 entire onion use 2-3 zucchini instead of a squash (or use both) corn is optional add 3 diced large tomatoes or a can of diced tomatoes and use approximately 5 cups (1 liter) of vegetable broth (or 1 Tablespoon of vegetable bouillon powder in 5 cups or 1 liter of water) for liquid in total. It doesn't need 7 cups of liquid. Kidney beans can be used if pinto beans are not available. Half a package of frozen spinach if fresh is not available. If you like REALLY thick stew remove some of the potatoes near the end of cooking blend in blender or food processor and add back to the stew. Salt to taste. Enjoy!",
