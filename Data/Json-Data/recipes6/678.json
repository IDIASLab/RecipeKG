I also used pecans instead of walnuts (another family preferance) and cut the mini chocolate chips back to a scant 1/3 cup. I made muffins out of this recipe--outr of one recipe I was able to get 16 biggish muffins. It turned out fabulously. Wonderful texture VERY moist lots of good banana flavor and we really liked the addition of the flax seed. Eight thumbs up from all four of us!",

Added 1/4 cup ground oats. Our 17-year-old health conscious picky-eater daughter declared it \"really good\" and cut a piece for herself. If it were just me I'd have put in the cinnamon and probably pecans but it was \"really good\"to me too. Baked as 9 x 5 loaf yielding 15 -16 thin-ish slices to keep from eatting too much all at once. Might try all white whole wheat flour next time and no AP next time but will make again. Thanks!",
