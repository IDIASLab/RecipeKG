I pressed down the topping before I baked (based on other reviewer's feedback) and that helped it adhere to the crust.  For the second layer of batter, I dropped it in teaspoons and then spread it. The cake itself is not too sweet and the cinnamon/chocolate combo was great.  Will definitely make again.",

                "reviewBody": "This cake is absolutely delicious. The batter is hard to work with though. A few suggestions: Cut the sugar in half (in the batter. In the topping I used 1/4 cup plus two tablespoons). You'll also save 22 calories per serving. If you're worried it won't be sweet enough use nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used sour milk instead of sour cream. Again it made the batter thinner (easier to work with) and it saves another 29 calories per serving. Finally I cut half a cup of the flour. Mostly because at that point I didn't see how I could stir in any other dry ingredients. There's a little less batter but it's easier to spread (be sure to cut a few minutes off the cooking time). And you just saved another 9 calories per serving. Not only is the cake slightly healthier this way but with food prices going up I see no reason to use more sugar or flour than needed. Most recipes are just fine if you cut the amount of sugar in half and this is no exception. Another suggestion - if you stir half the topping into the batter instead of trying to cut the batter in half it's much easier to work with. I've also never experienced a problem with dryness - I suspect people who have this problem simply overcooked it or left it out uncovered for too long.",
