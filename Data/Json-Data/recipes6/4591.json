I'm transitioning to a vegetarian diet and this is making it easier.:-) That being said I had to make some changes partly out of necessity and partly by design. My garlic looked strange so I had to use garlic powder. I didn't measure...I just shook a ton in. I didn't have 4 stalks of celery so I substituted a bag of frozen celery carrot and onion blend and then threw in a couple handfuls of onion that I already had chopped. Because I added more vegetables I added an additional teaspoon of curry powder (I wanted it spicy). I also used brown rice and a mix of green and red lentils (it's habit). Like others I skipped the blending and left everything whole. Without blending the potato seems a bit unnecessary so I might leave it out next time...and I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!",

I sauteed the onion garlic and celery until soft then added all the rest of the ingredients to the pot brought to boil and let it simmer 45 minutes. Oh and I used 3/4 C uncooked rice instead of the cooked and upped the liquid by 1.5 C to compensate. After the 45 minutes it was a soft stew like texture with no spare liquid. I added some more water and blended it up. End result needed salt and I also added a little parsely to jazz it up but pretty darn good overall.",
