Here are my changes:\n\n-**Use only about 1/2 to 3/4 amount of suggested beans, otherwise it gets to be rather beany tasting and overpowers other flavors.\n\n-I don't like green peppers, so I just use red and yellow.  It's glorious.\n\n-Make sure to use fresh pineapple--cut pineapple up and leave in the fridge for a while before serving.  This way it drains a bit and you can use the excess juice in addition to the OJ.\n\n-I also add fresh mango and a five or so baby tomatoes.  \n\n-also very nice on crackers",

I did add some fresh lime juice but kept everything else the same. I could eat this by itself and did while my chicken was cooking. It is so light and fresh and crisp and tart and sweet! My husband tasted it and immediately scooped some in a bowl to eat with chips as an appetizer. This is definitely something to serve for Cinco de Mayo for guests or just as a light and satisfying complement to a meal. Honestly if I was a vegetarian I would probably eat this by the bowlful! But I do have to say the lime juice is what made it perfect to me. I read the recipe four times because I thought for sure there should be lime juice.",
