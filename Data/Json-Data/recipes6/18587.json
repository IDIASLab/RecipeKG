I omitted the ketchup and used a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce instead and mixed those with the instant onion soup before pouring on top of vegetables and meat. Then I poured about a cup of water over all. I served with mashed potatoes using the sauce as a gravy. It was absolutely delicious!",

I used 2 - 12 oz cans of V8 veggie juice instead of tomato juice since that is what I had on hand. Cut the ketchup to about 3/4 cup and added 1 can of diced tomato. Sauteed fresh mushrooms in Worchestshire sauce with hunks of celery stalks and garlic powder that I put on the bottom of the crock pot. I did not add additional salt or oregano nor green peppers. There is already enough salt in the juice and diced tomatos. I did use dried basil in place of the oregano and added a couple of bay leaves. With doubling the recipe I do believe that 1 envelope of beefy onion soup mix is plenty. We served this wonderful dish over homemade mashed potatoes along with a couple of other side items. Just great comfort food.",

I have however changed the method ever so slightly in that I dump all the veggies back in the pan with a tad bit more olive oil and saute till slightly browned. I then dump them all atop the meat and sprinkle with the soup mix and oergano. I then mix the juice and ketchup and pour over all. Cover and bake for 1 hour checking about 1/2 way through to make sure there is enough liquid. Is wonderful with baked patatoes that were put in the oven at the start.",
