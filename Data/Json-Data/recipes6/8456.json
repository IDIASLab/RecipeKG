Flavor was good - kind of has an enchilada flavor, but dry. I was concerned about the tortilla chips getting mushy when covered in the sauce - so I did tossed them quickly. However, they kind of mushed together when baked - so I wasn't very fond of the texture. If it had more sauce, maybe it would be better.  If I made this again, I would use fewer chips, increase the sauce and eat with a lot of salsa and sour cream. Also - if you already have shredded chicken on hand, that will save a lot of time!",
