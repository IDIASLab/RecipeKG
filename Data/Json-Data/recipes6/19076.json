I'm just reviewing it to note two things: First, the recipe is for jam, not jelly. Submitter uses the terms interchangeably, but to clarify, jam has fruit pieces in it while jelly is a puree, so be sure not to puree your berries when making it. Secondly, sometimes when preserving things, it's important to do just one batch at a time, but this recipe will work fine doubled, yay! I've calculated the cost of strawberry freezer jam and around here it comes to a little over a dollar per 12-ounce jar, not counting the cost of the jars themselves. That's well worth it to have the year-round treat of easy, delicious, homemade jam!",

I would like to clarify some statements that were made in previous reviews about the terms \"jam\" and \"jelly\" and how they were improperly interchangable.  It is important to know the differences of the two in that jam is  a product that has physical pieces of fruit in the finished product, Jelly is merely a product which is \"jelled\" using strained fruit juice...NOT an actual fruit puree which yeilds a distinctly different \"smoothie\" kind of end product; Also the Juice, Fruit, Sugar, Pectin ratios are also different so be careful about interchanging these terms or you could quite possibly have a less than desired non-congealed end product.  Incredibly simple preperation with a very extravagent outcome! What more could you ask!",
