I used blender on pulse mode to crush them.  some were still whole but that gives texture to pie.  Secondly, I used a trick taught to me years ago.  I kept the streusel topping as directed in recipe, but used the second crust to cut up into little squares.  It helps if you have it frozen before cutting.  Then mix the crust pieces into the streusel topping.  Now pour over your cranberry-apple mix.  You will be amased at the look and taste of your creation........ Thanks for a great base recipe Nils.",

I increased the sugar in the filling to 1 1/4 cups, as I like slightly sweeter desserts, and will do it that way from now on.  I had no difficulty smashing the cranberries using a potato masher in a large bowl.  It took a little time, but I had some, and I had some frustration to burn off, so it worked out well for me.  The only other thing I changed was the walnuts -- didn't measure them.  I probably used more like a cup.  I wanted a little more topping, as I was using my tart pan, which is a little bigger than a pie plate.  I liked the look of the picture posted with the recipe, and wanted that extra WOW factor.  The only other thing I want to say about this pie is that it's super simple to make, and if you have cranberries in your freezer year-round like I do, you can make it any time!",
