Use a ciabatta loaf or slice larger pieces of french bread.  Be sure to slice the tomato, sausage, cucumber very thinly otherwise you'll  have problems getting it all in your mouth!  Also, I think I would like to use more garlic (I love the flavor of garlic) and let it sit in the cream cheese/butter mixture for an hour or two so they take on more of the garlic flavor.  This is a great sandwich though and I loved how unique it was!",

I used turkey kielbasa sliced lengthwise and browned in a pan and we skipped the hard-boiled eggs (mostly because I forgot about them). We did this twice once with cold (but browned) kielbasa and once with the sausage right out of the pan; I'd recommend using it cold otherwise it melts the cream cheese mixture and you end up with an incredibly messy sandwich. We loved the cream cheese mixture although I think next time I might just mix the garlic with cream cheese and see if it's as good without the extra fat from the butter. All in all - great combination! Thanks! EDIT: Made again skipping the butter but including the hard-boiled eggs. I think skipping the butter did make the garlic spread slightly less awesome - it doesn't spread as smoothly and obviously tastes more strongly of cream cheese - but it's still pretty darn good. If you're not totally averse to eggs definitely take the time to do those. Adds a nice creaminess to the sandwich.",
