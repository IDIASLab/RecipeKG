I made some cream cheese icing for the top used 3/4 cup molasses instead of 1 cup and rolled them out to just a little bit thicker than the recommended 1/4 inch. My friends loved them and they were so fun to make:) The recipes does have a type-o in it. It calls for the use of baking soda in the ingredients and baking powder in the recipe. It was a 50/50 chance and luckily I chose the correct one which was BAKING SODA.",

I knew it was \"off the mark\" when I saw the cut out cookies with a sugar frosting on top!!!! A recipe for Joe Froggers first appeared in print in Eleanor Early's cookbook, \"New England Cookbook\"published by Random House in 1954. Here is an excellent blog on making Joe Froggers, which gives some great background on the cookie and its history in Marblehead, Massachusetts. http://www.katyelliott.com/blog/2011/12/recipe-joe-froggers-cookies-from-marblehead.html\nEleanor Early's recipe calls for rolling the dough to 1/2\" and cutting with a large round cookie cutter, suggesting a coffee can be used as such. Though named after Joseph Brown, a freed slave from Marblehead, the cookie is credited to his wife Lucretia Brown.\n\nMake them as written, and make no substitutions and you will enjoy a true New England classic.",

I probably added another whole CUP of flour as I was rolling out these cookies just to be able to get them up off the counter. I think I will play around with this recipe though because I really liked the texture of the cookie--firm yet chewy. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of molasses and substitute the other half with light corn syrup. I think I will also skip the cloves and add in cinnamon instead. I may even think about adding more flour to the dough to cut down on the stickiness and help with rolling out. For now this recipe only gets 2 stars but I will try again.",
