Toast the alomnds & sesame seeds in a saute pan (why heat the oven) Just put them both in the pan crank the heat to high and constantly stir.  Has soon as they start to brown turn the heat off and coninut stiring until golden brown. 3 min tops.  As for the dressing use rice wine vinegar and added 2T soy sauce. Since I used all 16oz. I needed a little more dressing. Instead of making more I used Good Seasons Asian Sesame with Ginger bottled dressing.",

I used 2-16 oz. pkgs of shredded cabbage, 3 pkgs. of Oriental flavored Ramen noodles, added about 1/4 c. soy sauce to the dressing (and thus, omitted the salt entirely), and tripled the almonds.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar since we are a family of diabetics.  Great recipe.  Next time I will try this as a summer main dish by adding some grilled chicken breast on top.
