The frosting should taste creamy not powdery.  Happy baking!!",

                "reviewBody": "I was SO prepared to give these a lacklustre review. \"Unadorned,\" they are flat tasting and not sweet enough.  My suggestions were to be to add  more vanilla, upped at least to a tsp., a little salt, maybe a 1/2 tsp., to make the flavors come alive, and maybe even a little more sugar.  They are tender and soft, with the characteristic light texture I've come to know that the combination of powdered sugar, oil and cream of tartar provide.  I was going to be generous and give them three stars - but as is I really didn't think they were even THAT good.  But then I frosted them. What a difference a little sweetness made, especially creamy, buttery sweetness! In fact, I would say this cookie is not  only better frosted, it is the *perfect* cookie to frost!  For the same reasons I had ambivalent feelings about them before they were frosted, are why I loved this cookie frosted, tho' I still would add a litte salt.  In addition to these being the perfect \"utensil\" for \"Butter Icing for Cookies,\" also from this site, they are simply gorgeous as well. The dough is quite soft (almost greasy, actually) so I chilled it for an hour or so before shaping it into cookies.  I used a medium cookie scoop and flattened them slightly before baking. Perfectly shaped when they went into the oven, they were perfectly shaped when they came out of the oven as well. With spring fever in full tow, after frosting I sprinkled them with pastel sugars.  These are just awesome 5-star good - WITH the frosting.",
