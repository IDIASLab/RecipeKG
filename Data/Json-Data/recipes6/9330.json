This was GREAT. I loved the smokey barbacue taste that she got from a slow cooker. I actually did not believe her when she said she put it in the crockpot.  She mixed the liquid smoke with the barbacue sauce and only added the dry rub onto the brisket.  She then after six hours took the brisket and put it on a grill pan to get the grill marks then tossed it back into the crockpot with the sauce.  This was just fork tender fall apart.  Excellent smokey BBQ taste.  I honestly thought that she had grilled this on the grill. When I got home she had this outstanding BBQ meal set on the table with candles and it's the best American BBQ meal I've had since being back home.  Tomorrow I will be sending her flowers.",

I did not add the BBQ sauce to the slow cooker because I had different types of sauce (Memphis honey Kansas City etc.) out for everyone to make their own favorite. I also made it Saturday shredded the meat and put it in a foil pan. I put the juices in a separate container to refrigerate overnight. On game day I took the fat off the juices and added them to the foil pan. Put the covered pan in a 250 degree oven and slowly warmed it up. It was fabulous. I am making it again next week for a different party and will do it with one sauce and add it to the cooker this time. I am sure it will be just as good.
