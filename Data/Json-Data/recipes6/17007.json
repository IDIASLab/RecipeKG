I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening but I think I'll try using all butter next time because simple recipes require the best ingredients. Initially I had some trouble slicing the slightly thawed logs that have been frozen. However the dough became less crumbly and sliced nicely after it thawed out a bit more. I sprinkled some colored sugar sprinkles on top of each unbaked cookie to make them more attractive. All in all these were good cookies and I will use the recipe again.",
