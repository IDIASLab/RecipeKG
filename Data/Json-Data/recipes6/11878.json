I've baked them three times in the last two days (see, I told you they're amazing!), each with a different balance of spices (once as written, once with the addition of some nutmeg and allspice and less ginger, and once with more molasses and the addition of nutmeg), all with spectacular results.  Some things I found helpful: 1) I baked them on parchment paper for exactly 13 minutes...perfect every time!; 2) I used a 1\" scoop and then rolled the cookies in sugar on the non-flat sides; 3) I used the back of a wooden spoon to flatten a bit before baking, and 4) the longer you beat the shortening with the sugar and egg, the crispier and more crumbly the cookie.  They do look exactly like the photo, and as perfect as something manufactured commercially, but with a MUCH better taste.  Thank you, Larry, for what is now probably my favorite cookie recipe!",

A few notes for those who are looking for that familiar degree of spiciness that leaves a bit of warmth in your mouth after the cookie is gone; add a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to your dough and mix well. You can also use ground white pepper. Many folks think they need to use more ginger, but 1 Tb is plenty for the size of this recipe. More ginger won't give you that zing, but pepper will. The recipe made 40 perfect little disks. I rolled them in sugar laced with more ginger, and flattened the balls slightly. They baked up nice and flat, looking much like the commercial variety, with a far superior flavor. Thank you SOOOOoooo much for this wonderful recipe. The one I've been searching for for decades!",

One note if you want them nice and flat once you put them on the cookie sheet flatten them slightly. Or when they have baked for half their time remove sheet from oven and gently \"drop\" or \"bang\" sheet on counter 1 or 2 times and cookies will flatten. I have used this recipe in a cooking class and it's always been a success.",

I roll them into tablespoon sized balls dip top in colored sugars & then flatten slightly on pan with a glass. This gives them the perfect crunch outside & slightly soft inner. Yummy yum yum!",
