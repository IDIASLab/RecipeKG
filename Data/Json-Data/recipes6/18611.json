Left out the oranges and lemons for the trial run (informal family evening). Simply made this in the slowcooker instead of cooking it and moving it to the slow cooker. IT WAS WONDERFUL anyway. It will certainly be a richer experience with the oranges and lemons but will probably make again with just the cranberries at times. This was a lovely change from other crockpot drinks we make in our crockpot in the winter (ginger punch chai tea cocoa mulled cider and a lemon-almond sweetened tea made using instant tea). I loved watching the cranberries gradually fall to the bottom of the slow cooker during cooking. With them being at the bottom they were well out of the way until people who wanted that last sip had to work for it - helping them savour the moment a little longer.... fun to watch the young ones willing to work so hard for one more drop! I guess we'll miss that if we cook this on the stove top first as indicated in the recipe.... hmmmm but will have to try that sometime.... This actually went faster than any of the other drinks I've made in the past. It might even become a holiday staple. Might try adding almond extract or some instant tea one of these times.... maybe.... it's pretty wonderful as is though.",
