I read how this wasn't very flavorful and too cake like.  That's why I added the extra pudding.  Everyone loved it.  I also didn't add the cherries, food coloring, cinnamon, or sugar.  Instead I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped pistachios and layered it between and on top of the bread mixture and swirled it through with a knife.  Came out great.",
