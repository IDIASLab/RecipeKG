                "reviewBody": "Coconut pie is my husbands favorite and I have used many different recipes over the years and have learned a few tips over the years that help cut down on the amount of time you spend standing over the stove.  When I make any custard style pie, I use a stainless steel mixing bowl that will serve as a double boiler, that will fit over a large saucepan, like an 8 quart pan.  Use just enough water so the the bottom of the mixing bowl is not touching the water. Bring water to a boil.  Using a microwave safe 1 qt measuring cup, heat milk until scaled (tiny bubbles around rim of cup). Be careful not to let milk boil.  Add sugar, flour and salt to the stainless steel mixing bowl stir to combine, set bowl over boiling water, add the hot milk and stir with a whisk until smooth.  It only takes a few minutes for the mixture to thicken and then you can follow the remainging part of the recipe.\r\nYou must be careful as the hot steam will escape for the sides of the bowl and you can get burnt if you are not careful. Use a pot holder or dish towel to hold on the mixing bowl while you stir it.  Since using this method, I've never burnt or scorched any filling that I was making and cooking time has been cut in half.",

I selected this recipe because it makes a bigger pie and I like to use a deeper pie plate.  My family (& especially my dad!) just love it.  I used whole milk and the filling is so creamy - really delish!  I increased the coconut to one & a half cups and felt it had plenty of coconut taste.  I used the 4 egg whites to make a meringue topping, sprinkled coconut over the top and browned it in the oven.  It looked great and tasted better.  Thanks Mary!",

If you don't expect a strong coconut taste, it is a very good pie. Be sure to use a non stick pan. I used stainless steel and the sugar burnt at the bottom, giving the pie a slight burned taste.

Of course, I am not the greatest cook, and I managed to bust the crust and cooked the wrong part of the egg (ha ha) before re-reading the recipe, but the filling ended up tasting incredible, despite the chef!  :O)  I also fixed some whipping cream with 4 tablespoons of white granulated sugar for topping.  I know that I am probably the ONLY person dumb enough to add the whipped topping right away (before the pie cools, in which case it melts into a cream), but just in case I'm not, a word to the wise:  WAIT UNTIL THE PIE COOLS before you add the whipped cream topping.  My pie wasn't really very attractive looking, but TALK ABOUT TASTY!!!!  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves coconut cream pies.  Now I have to go make my \"common sense\" notes so that I don't rough up the crust or mess up the eggs again next time I try this recipe.  It usually takes me two tries on a new recipe anyway. I guess we'll have to eat the practice pie tonight and try again tomorrow! OH DARN!! HA HA",

I made it with two cups skim milk and one cup cream and it was incredibly rich. You could only eat a small sliver. Next time I will use only milk and I think it will be plenty rich and creamy and lower fat. My recommendation is to make this the night before. Because the coconut is not cooked with the custard the custard does not have a coconut flavor right away. While it sits overnight the coconut has a chance to re-constitute plumping it up and infusing the pie with coconut flavor. I topped it with whipped cream and toasted coconut.",
