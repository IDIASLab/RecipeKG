I ended up baking this for an extra 15 minutes, and the consistency was crunchy on the outside and very soft, almost creamy on the inside. I\u2019m thinking  375\u00baF might be a bit better than 350\u00baF.   It is very rich, and the texture is somewhat like a souffle (it even puffed up when baking).  This was  good, just too sweet for us, but that just could be personal taste preference.  Certainly is easy to make, and it\u2019s always nice to get up in the morning and have your breakfast just waiting to head into the oven.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
