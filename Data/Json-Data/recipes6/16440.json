                "reviewBody": "I'm only giving this 5 stars because of the changes I made to it. I was a little nervous about the raw eggs and 1/2 c of coffee seemed like a lot too. These are the differences in ingredients that I went with: 3.5 oz dark choc cadbury bar 2 tbsp instant coffee granules just enough water to dissolve the coffee maybe a tsp didn't actually measure just got it wet did not use honey at all because I forgot but it didn't matter it was fantastic without it 6 tblsp butter Changes to the directions: In my countertop mixer I beat the eggs and sugar for about five min or until pale yellow. Using a double boiler (or make-shift one in my case) I put the egg mixture in the pot and started adding the chocolate a little at a time until it was melted and smooth then added the butter about a tblsp at a time until all smooth. Next I removed the mixture and returned to the mixer. I dissolved the coffee and added it to the mixture mixed then began adding the cocoa powder a little bit at a time until smooth. The mixture will be very thick at this time. I whipped the heavy cream until stiff peaks formed then tried to fold it it but it looked lumpy so I jsut took a whisk to it to get the lumps out. When it was smooth I put it in my lined pan and refridgerated for about 8 hours. It turned out perfect! I chose to put my in a shallow pan instead of a loaf pan so that I could use a cookie cutter to make a heart (Valentine's Day). Highly recommend this dessert!",

The flavor was excellent and I did not think the coffee flavor was too much even though I used espresso powder! I did have some problems with the directions. I could not get the butter and cocoa powder to combine and wondered if the directions should have read to combine the butter with the sugar. Despite the wonderful taste the finished product had small lumps of butter that I could not beat in and the sugar never dissolved leaving a grainy texture to the dessert.",
