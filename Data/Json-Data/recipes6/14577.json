Easy to roll out (even easier to mix since I used the food processor), rich and flavorful, thanks to the egg, butter and sugar; tender and flaky. A light egg wash of a beaten yolk and a little water gave this beautiful crust the beautiful golden sheen it deserved. One of the best and easiest crusts I've ever tried.",

I use this recipe to make Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings by Micki. If you're making pie crust for the first time, this is a good one to start with...you can't mess it up. It's super easy and super delicious. Your diners will be impressed. I used all butter...no shortening (my family can't have shortening). And when I cut the recipe in half, I beat one egg, and simply pour half of it down the drain. I use King Arthur all-purpose unbleached, unbromated white flour. Absolutely delicious! Thank you SO very much for sharing this recipe!",

Aside from being delicious it was absolutely the easiest pie crust dough I've ever worked with. So smooth! I rolled it out on parchment paper and used very little flour to prevent sticking and it didn't stick at all not to the parchment and not to the rolling pin. Shortening isn't fit for human consumption so I used lard and butter instead. I might try all butter next time. I used a frozen stick of butter which I then grated. The lard was chilled in the fridge before using. I also used my KitchenAid mixer with the whisk attachment to cut in the butter and lard then mixed the rest in with a large fork then by hand. This will be the only crust recipe I use from now on. Thanks for posting it!!",
