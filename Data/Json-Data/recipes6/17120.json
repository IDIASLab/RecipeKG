I think folks are getting cakey results when they add an egg or use some liquid other than the oil, as that will change the texture of any baked product.  The batter is very, very dry - almost too dry to call a batter.  But that's how it's supposed to be, the zucchini will shed it's moisture during the baking and you'll get superb brownies!!

I must say that I was VERY skeptical of these not only because of the zucchini/no egg, but because after I mixed the ingredients, they looked well, I'll just say..less than desirable (my zucchini may have been a bit \"dry\").  I had to \"press\" them into the dish, not \"pour\" so I was a bit concerned.   The end result was FANTASTIC, not to mention a great way to sneak in zucchini, the kids had NO clue that it was even there!  I left out the nuts, baby has an allergy, and added 1/2 cup of choc. chips.  Since there weren't any eggs either (allergy) he was able to enjoy!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, we LOVED them!!",

If you add an egg you will get a cake. I don't understand those that change the recipe and then give a bad rating.  The only change I made is that I only added 1/4 cup nuts.  Mine were done at 20 minutes.  The frosting is excellent but they really don't need it.  Thanks so much!!!  A keeper!!!",

And like other reviewers have confirmed it is a tad cake-like (no I did not add an egg which would have made it even more cakey) but in a very moist gooey way. As long as you underbake it slightly you should be fine. Use cocoa powder instead of flour for dusting the greased pan that way you won't get a whitish floury outside. Substituting applesauce for most of the oil worked out great - the brownies were still moist and tender. I grated the zucchini superfine so as not to have it \"chunky\". My little brother will never know he's eating zucchini and applesauce!",

The batter is dry to start, because the zucchini is the moisture. The batter will be quite dry when you put it into the pan, but if you followed the directions....it will bake perfect. It will be a chewy brownie if you do it this way.\n\nTo make it easier, I grate or puree my zucchini FIRST to let it sit for a while to \"sweat\".   This step allows the moisture to be released from the zucchini.  Then I add the zucchini(moisture & all)to the dry ingredients mix. It won't be dry at all...it will resemble a cake batter, and the result a bit more cake like brownie, but still divine. \n\nThis recipe is very easy & great way to use up extra summer squash ( yellow, crockneck, italian, mexican..etc...) from the garden.  I freeze grated summer squash in 2 cup portions so I have it in the winter when I want these.  I just pull out a container to thaw & ready to go....further extending my garden harvest. delicious :) I usually reduce the sugar to around 1 - 1 1/4 cup as my preference... :)enjoy! ",
