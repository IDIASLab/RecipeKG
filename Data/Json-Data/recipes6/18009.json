I used buttermilk powder rather than fresh buttermilk, which I have always found is a very acceptable substitute. I also used a combination of orange and lemon juice and added an extra 2T. of sugar to compensate for the tartness of the lemon. Thinking it couldn't hurt, I added the zest from half of a small lemon. My only criticism, and I believe noteworthy, is that if using 1/2 tsp. of the cinnamon mixture in the filling as directed, you'll end up with twice as much as you need! My suggestion would be to make half as much rather than add more of the filling to the muffins, but that may be just a personal preference.  These must be good because hubs, who doesn't care for citrusy stuff and doesn't like muffins much either, asked me to hold a few aside for him before I gave the rest away!",

However, on a bright note these muffins are so moist and full of flavor on their own that next time I would add some orange zest to heighten the orange flavor.  I made this into 6 Texas sized muffins and used turbinado sugar vs. white in the topping to give it an extra crunch. They baked up very nice and the extra cinnamon/brown sugar inside was a nice touch!",

A mistake I remember for all muffins/crumb cakes.  I use the mixture for the middle AND for the topping to do TWO batches.  I can't imagine using all of it for one.  Outside of that... wow is this quick and easy!!  I fill them to just about the top so there is a nice \"muffin top.\"  Not sure why all muffin recipes say only 2/3rd full or whatever.  Better if you go towards the very top!! Made 10-11 muffins in a normal muffin tin. :)  Also my oven tends to bake fast, so it only took 17 min.",

I also added chopped pecans into both the cinnamon swirl mixture and the topping it was very good added a nice extra and a little crunch. I will most likely make these again.",

I wisked together the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients seperately then folded the wet into the dry to prevent overmixing. I used a teaspoon measuring spoon to evenly distribute the topping over all the muffins. These baked up perfectly and everyone just loved them. I did not have any issues with dry muffins. I highly recommend doing what I did and using thawed orange juice concentrate and adding orange zest for more orange flavor.",

The texture and flavor were perfect. The orange juice adds a subtle flavor making them more unique. I accidentally put the cinnamon/sugar mixture in the middle and the brown sugar/butter mixuture on top...they still turned out great! The small amount of extra time they require is more than worth the terrific results! Thanks for submitting this recipe!",
