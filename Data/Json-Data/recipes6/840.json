Salted and peppered ribs, then quickly browned them on the stovetop on all sides. Cooked for 5 hours on high as directed. Ribs turned out perfect and the taste of the sauce is amazing. It had just enough sweetness though, so adding as much sugar and honey as recipe calls for would be too much. Thanks for a delicious recipe! It will become my staple.",

Also dijon mustard instead of ground because that's all I had on hand. The pork ribs just fell apart & were so tender & flavorful. My Aunt was in town & she was just amazed by how good they were. Only thing I would do differently was either boil ribs first or use a ladle to get grease off of sauce. Another way would be to put sauce in fridge until grease turns thick & scrape it out. We poured the sauce over the top but it was a bit greasy from the ribs. There was enough sauce to save for another dish. Perhaps on the bbqer? Served with baked beans & baked potato. Very good recipe! Thanks will use again. Maybe with chicken next time.",

I followed the recipe exactly as it called for and the ribs were delicious. There appeared no need to brown them ahead of time or boil them or broil them either. As someone suggested once cooled I skimmed the fat and threw it out. So if concerned about the excess fat I would suggest making them one day ahead. Everyone loved this. I even used the remaing sauce to make baked beans right in the crock pot! They were delicious too!! THANKS!",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe base that really lends itself to adjustments for whatever flavor profile you're looking for. However before dropping these ribs in the slow cooker you should really stick them under the broiler for 10-15 minutes to brown them and render away some of that fat. Otherwise the fat is going to end up dripping into the sauce and your ribs are going to be floating around in a loose oily base (see the one picture someone uploaded) instead of being the sticky thick beauts they should be. I skipped this step the first time around and had to reduce/skim the liquid in a pan afterward then baste the ribs with the fixed sauce. Still ended up working but an unnecessary headache that could probably be avoided by browning them first. At least I'm assuming; I haven't tried browning them first yet. You may still want to drain and reduce the sauce afterward if you're not getting that sticky texture.",
