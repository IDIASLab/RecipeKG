I always have several cans of spam on hand for emergencies, though I have literally never eaten it in my life.  I figured this was a good time to give it a try.  The pineapples kind of helped me decide.  Anyway, to my great surprise it came out really great.  I had to use a frozen mix of red and green peppers, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My son loved it!  I don't really eat meat..Not for any reason other than I don't like the texture of most meat, lol.  But I do taste it, and this actually was very good.  I made broccoli sauteed with butter and garlic, a touch of olive oil on the side.  All in all it came out great and was super easy.",
