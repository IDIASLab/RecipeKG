I didn\u2019t have an Apple corer so I did the wooden spoon method.  Next time I\u2019ll use a straight potato peeler. It will take some cake out.   With the spoon method most of the jam pooled at the base of the cake.  I really liked the way the powdered sugar glaze soaked into the cake.  Make sure to follow the recipe as it states in terms of cooling and moving the cake away from the pan.  It will stick if you don\u2019t.",
