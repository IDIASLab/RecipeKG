Will keep these in mind for days when there is simply too much zucchini in the house.  /  Though we love banana & chocolate chip pancakes or waffles, this recipe seemed a bit heavy for our taste...., *****but then again****, we might need to give them a second chance, since my family made these up for me on my teaching night...., and they used baking soda instead of powder - and yes, we made them as pancakes since that was easier for them (yes, we could taste the baking soda a tad more than I'd like, but overall, the flavor was nice in spite of the error).  Will try to post a follow up if we try these again with baking powder.  I am definitely saving this recipe, even though I'm not sure it's a high priority to want to eat these again, but mostly because it's a nice alternative for using up zucchini.",
