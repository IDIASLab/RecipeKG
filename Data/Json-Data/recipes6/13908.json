I'm only so-so on this salsa recipe but I also shared a jar with my extended family and they claimed to have liked it alot too. However it is MY opinion that it is too time consuming for the taste it produces. But if you like chunky salsa's and are willing to spend some time I'd say give it a whirl. Its not that I found this recipe \"bad\" - its just not my favorite. But then again - my opinion seems to be the minority (BUT THEY DIDN'T COOK IT EITHER - that's easy for them to say!:)) Thanks!",
