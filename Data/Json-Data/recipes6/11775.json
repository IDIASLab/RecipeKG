I added 12 oz of pineapple with the juice squeezed out and I used heavy whipping cream for rich flavor.  The directions aren't specific enough for the inexperienced candy maker though.  This fudge should be cooled til lukewarm without stirring. The trick it to not being crumbly is to beat it until it thickens somewhat and the color becomes duller and lighter than it was before you started beating it.",

Here's how I fixed it: I added an extra teaspoon of lemon juice and I drizzled in some extra heavy cream. Just enough to make it smooth when mixed. Mine turned out very well...very smooth. Of course there is that bit of texture but you expect that because there is pineapple in it and no matter how much you cook it pineapple will be grainy. It is very sweet though so I'd suggest cutting it in smaller peices than you normally would for fudge. I hope this helps someone. Have fun!",
