I made only half the recipe, cutting the cookies into 2 1/2\" circles. I wound up with 23 cookies instead of 12. Visually they are very pale. An egg wash or even a sprinkle of sugar before baking would brown them nicely. If I ever make these again I will roll them out and cut into 4\" circles, place filling and fold over, empanada style.

I think raisins are the worst prank ever when you bite into a cookie thinking it\u2019s a chocolate chip and discovering it\u2019s just an elderly raisin. That being said, this rating stems largely from him. He deemed them \u201creally good\u201d. I followed the recipe as is, subbing oat milk for the heavy cream as Mr. LTH is eating vegan. Dough was a touch crumbly and next time I\u2019ll likely skip the refrigerating step (likely had to do with the lack of fat in the oat milk). Simple enough, post chilling, yielding only 17 cookies (using the smallest round biscuit cutter I could find). Also, how does one chop sticky raisins... Thank you, for the recipe!",
