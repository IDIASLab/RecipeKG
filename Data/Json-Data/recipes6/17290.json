I absolutely love pot stickers, but have only eaten them at restaurants and at home, by way of using pre-made frozen ones from the store... I was so excited to try this recipe when I found it, and I haven't stopped using it regularly since. I do, however, use different fillings, depending on what I have in the fridge, but the pot sticker dough this recipe yields is just fantastic... everything tastes good in it! As for some reviewers saying that these were too \"doughy\", well I thought I would point out that pot stickers are meant to have a soft, chewy-doughy texture, not meant to be crispy like eggrolls or wantons, etc. I've never felt this recipe to yield pot stickers that are too doughy because I always roll the dough out thinly... they look and taste absolutely delicious, and I've found that they are just as good as ones from restaurants.",
