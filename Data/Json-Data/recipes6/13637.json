I think with these modifications, people will find that \"something\" they thought was missing.  \r\n\r\nI used 3 vine-ripened tomatoes and one large sweet or vidalia onion.  I simmered the tomatoes and onion and spices like it said.  Just before it was done simmering I did step 2.  Before adding the mixture from the other pot, I added a large can of crushed tomatoes.  Then I added the mixture of tomatoes, onions and spices.\r\n\r\nI kept adding salt and pepper to taste.  Towards the end I also kept adding parmesan(sp?) cheese to taste.  You can add milk and/or water to make it creamier or soupier.  \r\n\r\nYou might want to go ahead and add another tomato or so if you want an extra tomato taste (I mean, in the begining, when simmering, not at the end of making it! haha)  \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would change is I would boil the tomatoes to remove the skins prior to simmering (at one point I thought there were worms in the soup, but it was tomato skin!).  Also, it would be good served with a dollop of sour cream on top.  \r\n\r\nThis was very yummy, I will be using it over and over!!  Hope this helped!",

That may have contributed to the onion flavor being stronger than anticipated. I'm going to reheat the leftovers and garnish with bacon crumbles and maybe some croutons and see if that livens it up. (...I just changed my rating to 4 stars it was very good the second day! Much more mellow. I'll make this again.) My advice DON'T add canned tomatoes or sauce then it's not FRESH tomato soup and it will be very acidic. Run the solids through a food mill or blender to get the most flavor.",

After the onions were soft (12-14 mins) I pureed the mixture in the blender half a batch at a time. I rinsed the pot then melted the butter added flour and milk and cooked for 5-7 mins stirring constantly so the milk wouldn't burn until thickened. Then I added the pureed tomatoes and onion and heated through. Serve hot with a garnish of goldfish crackers a handful of shredded cheese and/or parmesan. Made 4 medium servings. Great with a grilled cheese sandwich.",
