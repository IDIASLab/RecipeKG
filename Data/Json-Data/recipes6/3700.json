You can't go wrong when you serve these beans at a potluck, barbecue, family gathering etc. These are a great accompaniment to burgers and hot dogs. My family even loves these during the holidays with spiral ham and potato salad and or macaroni salad. The secret to this recipe is following the directions and using brand names mentioned. All who try these beans rave about them and typically ask for the recipe.",
