I use 3/4cup dark brown and 1cup white sugar and real vanilla extract (i dont like artificial flavorings). I let the water come to a boil in the pot, then add the sugars and simmer gently for about 5 mins. I check the consistency with a metal spoon and let it cool to see if it has the appropriate 'feeling' to it before removing it from the heat and adding a 1/4cup of honey and then transferring it to a glass jar. I keep mine in the fridge and have never had a problem with it crystalizing. I warm up the syrup before serving if it has been in the fridge and use it for waffles and pancakes. I will be experimenting with other types of extracts and using it for smoothies/ice cream etc... in the future. Will try with splenda as well. :) VERY cheap to make compared to storebought!",

Like the others I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also double the maple flavoring and add some butter flavoring as well. Also I add 1/4 c of corn syrup. This thickens it up a bit and adds a store-bought consistency to the syrup. When I cook the syrup I have it on medium heat and I allow it to boil lightly for 10 minutes or so. Then I remove from heat and allow it to thicken up.",

I'm currently living overseas and the country I live in doesn't use maple syrup despite the fact that they sell real American pancake mix go figure. Recently we wanted pancakes so I prayed to the culinary gods in hopes of finding a recipe on here and was soooo happy to find this. The only downside was it's need for maple extract (yep can't get that either!) so I thought maybe using vanilla would be okay but I was still worried. I was THRILLED to see so many others saying they used vanilla instead! Indeed using the vanilla was great! I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar (didn't have any dark brown sugar) and I also added about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of real butter. Yes it's true; the end result will not lead to a thick syrupy texture that many are used to but I don't know of many normal people who drink the left over syrup off their plates anyway. I cannot thank you enough for this recipe it's allowed me to hang on to a few of my comforting American foods.",

I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar and it made it the brown color that store bought syrup is. The taste was awesome I may have put just a little more maple flavor in because I didn't have the right measuring spoon. To thicken it I used 1-2 ounces of corn starch/water mixture threw it in the freezer for about a half an hour and then to the fridge. This morning it is about the right consistancy.
