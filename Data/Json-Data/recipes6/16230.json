I'd recommend these changes:\n1) Use about 1/2 a cup of extra strong coffee, instead of a full cup of regular.  Brew with the same amount of grounds, just half as much water.  This mimics espresso.\n2) Use a lot more milk.  Starbucks mochas are mostly milk, with espresso added.\n3) Do use the full tablespoon of both chocolate and sugar.  \nWith these changes it came much closer to approximating a Starbucks mocha.  I enjoyed it!",
