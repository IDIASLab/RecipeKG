I removed the chicken when half done and sauteed chopped white onion in the pan juices per another reader's suggestion. When the onion was soft I deglazed with chicken broth added more Sazon and spices. Added the chicken back in. When the sauce reduced I coated the chicken pieces and added the bok choy. Served it all on a bed of rice. So tasty and so easy. Thanks for my new chicken and rice dish!",

I went with about a tablespoon and that was good. 3. The recipe doesn't say how long the sugar step takes. I'd say it was between 10 and 15 minutes of stirring. 4. I didn't have bok choy. I used cut up summer squash and zucchini. It was great! 5. Saffron rice made a nice accompaniment.",
