They loved it!  In fact it was so well received I never even got a piece.  Why this poor little recipe has been languishing so long is a mystery to me.  It was so easy to make, I never even pulled out my mixer - I did it all by hand in no time flat.  It took about an hour to rise to the top of the pan but my kitchen was sort of cool.  I did increase the cinnamon to 2 tsp, but that was my only change.  Thank you Annette!",

I have been searching for some years for Raisin batter bread that I loved as a kid made from the school cafeteria. This one is still very yummy but a little different in taste as I remember the school cafeteria raisin batter bread was more buttery and the glaze was sweeter.I think I will make it for Christmas morning using a orange glaze next time I make it.",

I reduced the yeast a little so I could let it rise overnight in a cool room (around 60 degrees). All in all the rise took 10 hours from the time I put it in the pan until I put it in the oven and it was perfect. Baked for 36 minutes and we were VERY pleased with this breakfast bread. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing the recipe!",
