What's so interesting about this cake is that it has no butter oil or shortening! It goes by many names but no matter what you call it it's moist delicious pineapple-y and mixes up in no time. I think I like my frosting better tho'...only 1/4 cup butter which I believe really gives it more of a cream cheese taste and 2 c. powdered sugar.",

It took me all of 3 minutes to put together. Just dump everything in one large bowl and mix together. Be sure to keep an eye on this as it tends to bake quickly. If it starts browning to much around the edges before the middle is set just lay a peice of foil on top until it's done. I didn't use the cream cheese icing because I didn't have any cream cheese. Out of desperation I found a birthday cake icing on this site and used it. I did find me another 5 star recipe so everything worked out for the best. Thanks Marie.",
