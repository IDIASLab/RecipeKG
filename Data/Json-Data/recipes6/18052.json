Usually with Yellow cake mix, but i've used White and Vanilla and it's been about the same each time--always a hit!  I usually don't invert it, but it's great either way.  And definitely even better with a dollop of whipping cream.  \n\nAlso, i mix about 3/4 cup of the cake mix into the pumpkin mixture--I think it gets rid of that mushy texture the pumpkin otherwise tends to have.  \n\nI made half with pecans (was out of walnuts) and half with no nuts.  Everyone agreed it was much better with the nuts.  \n\nI used 4 tsp of Pumpkin Pie seasoning, and it wasn't too much...could have even used more.  and i only used 6 tbsp of butter-it was plenty.\n\n",
