I used a food processor to chop up my veggies, so it was super easy!! While my first load of veggies and stock was cooking, processed the zucchini and broccoli and placed in a bowl with the dried basil and pepper, then processed the spinach and placed in second bowl.  I used a spoonula for stirring soup as well as scraping my processor bowl. Seasoning was perfect, remember to use ripe veggies for full flavor!! This is a keeper, I'll be making more tomorrow! :) ",

I sauteed 1 onion 2 cloves of garlic and a tsp of grated ginger with 1 tbs of butter then added in the celerys stems of broccoli and potato until tender before adding the broth. It was a tad too thick and salty after blending (but tts bcos i put in 1 tsp of salt not knowing tt the chicken stock was rather salty!) so i added 3/4 of water and 1/2 cup milk before bringing the pureed soup to heat. This created a nice balance of flavours. The soup had a nice lightly spicy kick to it!",
