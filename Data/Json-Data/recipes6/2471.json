I did sub out some of the pretzels for peanut butter chex cereal I had that I wanted to use up. It was a nice variation. I always stir my peanuts in with the sauce after it has cooked with the baking soda. That way the peanuts seem to adhere to the other ingredients and aren't straggling around at the bottom of the bowl. The candy corn and M&Ms made it very festive!",
