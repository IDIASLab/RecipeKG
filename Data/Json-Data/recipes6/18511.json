I can't possibly imagine using 1 1/2 cups of sugar! And I added cinnamon to the peaches and allspice to the batter. Also I used soy milk instead of regular milk. I cooked this recipe in a glass pan and it took about 20 minutes longer than what the original time calls for. The next time that I make this I think I'll add vanilla to the batter like one of the other reviewers suggested. I tasted the batter before I put anythiing in it and it tasted to dull. So play with your spices and doctor it up a little!",

In addition as my husband is a diabetic I substitued granular Splenda for the sugar - just followed the online Splenda info source (www.splenda.com) to add 1/2 tsp. of extra baking powder for every cup of Splenda used instead of sugar and checked for earlier cooking time. It turned out really well except that the outcome was a little \"paler' than it would have been with real sugar. I suppose I can always sprinkle some sugar on top to add some color. Also I added a tsp. of ground cinammon and vanilla as suggested by earlier reviewers. I will definitely make it again.",
