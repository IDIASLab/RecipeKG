To try to make it more healthy I substituted 1 cup of white flour with 2 heaping tablespoons of milled flax seed and then filled the rest of the measuring cup with whole wheat flour. It was a gloppy mess after the dough cycle ended so I added a small amount of white flour (2-3 T) and gently worked it in; let it rise in warm oven for about 20 minutes and continued onward. I also increased cinnamon to 1 t (we love cinnamon) and omitted the raisins. It did take a little longer bake 4-5 minutes maybe and as suggested I lightly covered it after 12 minutes of baking. Not a hard a recipe -- machine did most of the work. Thanks Marylyn! P.S. No one noticed the flax or the wheat:-)",
