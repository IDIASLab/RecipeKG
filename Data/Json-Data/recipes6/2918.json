I replaced the honey with maple syrup . I also added onion powder. The original recipe is basically a fantastic base to build your own next level sauce . Try out my take on this one and you won't be disappointed :)",

I substituted 1/2 cup of water (1/4 or the called for water) for 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, because I used half of it as a marinade for my chicken, before thickening the rest. \n\nI served it mixed with the chicken that I cubed and marinated with the sauce and cooked with sesame oil. If you are new to using sesame oil, it has a very low flash point, so use half sesame oil and half some other oil. I use canola.  After the chicken was cooked, I added a can of pineapple chunks, drained, and half of the thickened sauce and simmered for about 3 minutes, just to get everything hot again (pineapple was room temperature) and incorporated, stirring once or twice. The other half of the sauce had on the side. \n\nThis was all served over white rice, cooked in chicken broth with a little ginger added.\n\nEverybody loved it, even my son's girlfriend, who is a very finnicky eater.",

Afterward, I stir fried up some cabbage and carrots and then threw it on some thin noodles I had lying around.   Easy and quick recipe and this sauce was delicious.",
