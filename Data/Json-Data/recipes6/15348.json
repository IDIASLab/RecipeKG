I did everything almost exactly as the recipe called for except I added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee powder along with the dry ingredients.

A delicate crisp on the outside and a soft chewy inside. They remind me of the double chocolate cookies at Panera's.",

I would suggest freezing the dough for a few hours or putting it in the fridge overnight before baking. Then roll into to tablespoon balls and flatten into patties after putting them on the cookie sheet. Try using butterscotch chips too! Great combo with the chocolate. I also added marshmallows to the center of them. Don't mix marshmallows into the batter though as they make the cookies impossible to get off the cookie sheet.",

Ten minutes was a perfect amt of time to bake them but I only let them cool for three minutes and that worked well.  They were firm & easily removed from the baking sheet. \r\n\r\nFor the first dozen I had only put in one cup of the choc chips because I thought I wouldn't want anymore but once I tasted one I felt that it could use the two cups.\r\n  \r\nThe recipe didn't indicate what size spoon to drop the rounded spoonfuls but I used a regular tablespoon and they came out a nice size, not too big nor too small.  \r\n\r\nAnother thing, I definitely needed a glass of milk with each cookie or atleast a half glass!",
