I topped with sliced almonds and a sprinkling of brown sugar and put it under the broiler for a minute after it was done. I wanted to find out if it was good chilled but it didn't last that long.:) thanks for the quick easy and elegant recipe!",

This recipe is pretty exact and I have found that if I try to mess with this recipe in just about any way it turns into a normal cake without the moistness and meringue top. When I have changed the bread crumbs or mixed too much air into this recipe or tried to half this recipe I am ususally dissappointed (I think halving the egg is tough and too much egg makes it dry). But give this cake a try and be exact the first time through. It is Elegant and fabulous alone or with Breyers French Vanilla Ice cream Hazelnuts and strawberries on the side",
