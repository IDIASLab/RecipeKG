They instantly became one of my favorite cookies! I did tweak it just a little. I used 1 teaspoon of cinnimon instead of /1/2 teaspoon and I used about a cup and a half of pumpkin instead of a single cup. I liked how they turned out. Another thing use just a teaspoon full of mixture on the cookie sheet to ensure the cookies are fully done at the 12 minutes and I liked how they tasted when they were just outta the oven versus letting them sit a while then eating them. I haven't yet tried how they are when re-heated. Hope everyone enjoys them as much as I did.",

Not knowing anything about American Holidays we choose Thanksgiving. Part of the assignment was to cook something that was typically eaten on the holiday. After searching for days for a recipe that seemed reasonable we came across this one. Being from Australia we took one look at the ingredients and my friend and i both thought the exact same thing: \"Man Americans are weird..! Putting Pumkin in cookies..whats next!!?\" But curiosity and desperation got the better of us and we eventually made the cookies. They turned out beautifully and our teacher even took some home with her! They're very easy to make and taste great!",
