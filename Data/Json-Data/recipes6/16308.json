I also use double action baking powder for all my baking as I find it better than the regular b.p.\nEnjoy!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Like many others this was my first attempt at au upside down cake and I have to say the recipe is very straightforward and easy to follow. Unfortunately my pan was not up to the task. I had bought a new 9 1/2 inch Wilton springform pan for the occasion and failed to test it before using it. When I melted the butter/brown sugar (which I doubled after reading earlier comments) in the pan the butter leaked out of the bottom of the pan and all over the foil I keep on the bottom of the oven. I have since read you should test spring pans to make sure they hold water before use and this one definately didn't so I will be exchanging it. Despite this rocky start however the cake turned out quite well. Not as pretty as the recipe pic probably because of the topping fiasco but very tasty. I did increase the flour by about two tablespoons so I could throw a handful of chopped plums and a handful of blueberries into the batter and that worked very well. I also added 1/3 cup of walnut pieces to the batter for a little more texture. I took a couple of pics before and after baking and will see if I can post them. In any event this is definately a recipe worth trying and I will be making it again.",
