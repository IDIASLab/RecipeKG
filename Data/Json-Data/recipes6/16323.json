Sugar cookies should be tender and soft, in my opinion.  After turning down the heat to 350 and baking for only 6 minutes, these were perfect.  I prefer sugar cookies using powdered sugar instead of granulated- I think it makes them more soft and tender.  Frosted with luscious buttercream frosting from this site.",

They weren't terribly difficult to make and the dough was easy to work with (with a well-floured board and rolling pin) but this recipe only made half the amount I thought it should. The taste was okay--a little bland but better with frosting. They also spread too much during baking and did not hold their shape very well at all! I don't think I'll make these again; they're just too bland and crumbly. I've tried several sugar cookie recipes from this website and one of the reviewers said she'd stick to the recipe in BHG for sugar cookie cutouts. Then I tried that recipe as well. I agree with her 100%--BHG's were exactly right just what I was looking for!",

I topped with buttercream icing and they were terrific I love the almond flavor. I'm not sure why some have had problems with this recipe but I would say to make sure the powdered sugar you measure is already sifted rather than taking a cup and a half of packed powdered sugar and THEN sifting it or you could end up with too much. And to keep them soft make sure you don't roll them out too thin these do need to be rolled out a bit thicker than most sugar cookies. The only problem I had was that this didn't make anywhere NEAR as many cookies as the recipe said it would but the ones I did have were fabulous!",

The powdered sugar in the recipe makes the dough easy to work with and the students can roll the dough many times without it becoming stiff. I always chill the cookie dough over-night for my classes but it can be placed in the freezer for 15 minutes and will roll out o.k. If it is too stiff to roll when you remove it on day two pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds so it is workable. (You may have to do this a couple of times.) I work with a small amount of dough at a time and leave the rest in the refrigerator. After it has been rolled once push the left-overs back together and roll again.",

I wrote it down on an envelope and lost it this past year and have been trying to find it again since it has been a family favorite! I have used this recipe for numerous projects at school for Valentines Day as a room mom soccer parties at home for any given holiday and bake sales etc. I have found that it is better to use the dough directly after mixing due to ease of use. It is a firm cookie when baked but flaky. It is a GREAT cookie for kids to decorate since they are not \"soggy\" in texture and hold up very well to little hands. They have wonderful flavor! I also bake my cookies for 12 min. instead of 8 or until the edges are a golden brown. We like the golden edges better and have noticed that they have almost a \"spritz\" like flavor. This is one recipe that I am happy to have back! Thank you!",
