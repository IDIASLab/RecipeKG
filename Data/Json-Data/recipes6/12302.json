They don't have a whole lot of flavor, though; I added some extra vanilla and some almond extract, though, and it turned out fine.  Because they are a little flour-y, I would recommend rolling them out in powdered sugar instead of flour (if you do it on a silicone mat, it is easier to get the powdered sugar spread evenly).  Also, be sure to refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  If the dough isn't well-chilled, it is kind of sticky and hard to transfer from the countertop to the cookie sheet.",
