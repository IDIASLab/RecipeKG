Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was better than average but not great. I decided to try again and increased the blueberries to 3 pints used 2/3 C buttermilk and put in 1 t vanilla. I used all the topping (it's a lot but people loved the topping). It was great warm with ice cream and I also used it for breakfast and got rave reviews. The recipe needs a bit of tweaking but now I will be using it often in the summer. I think you could put a teaspoon of almond extract rather than vanilla and get a different but very nice coffee cake too.",
