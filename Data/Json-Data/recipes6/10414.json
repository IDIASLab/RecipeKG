Her recipe had you adding the water a little at a time when you added the flour. She also baked the bread in clean vegetable cans she saved to make mini loaves for gift giving. I use mini loaf pans instead. I also pair up the bread with a small container of home-made honey butter to make a great sweet treat gift! My friends and family love it! If you want, you can also include a small chees spread knife.",

Far better then any recipe Betty C. ever gave us - it takes a bit longer to cook then it says - I baked it at 350 along with a banana bread I was making and it still took a little over an hour.  You might also add to the instructions add the date mixture (water/soda/date) instead of just adding dates -my 10yo daughter was helping me make it and she couldnt figure out how to get the dates out of the water w/o getting water into the batter until I told her to dump the whole thing in =) Thanks Peggy!!!!",

At an hour the inside was still doughy, so I covered it with tinfoil to prevent anymore outside darkening, and it was done about 15 minutes later.  An added cupful of raisins (or chocolate chips) goes wonderfully in the batter as well!",
