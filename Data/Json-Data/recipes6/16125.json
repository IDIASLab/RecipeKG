I agree with the previous reviewers - because of the way the recipe is written, it's easy to make a mistake with the corn syrup, and add too much to the cream cheese mixture. But if you follow the directions carefully, you will end up with a fabulous, fluffy pumpkin pie, enhanced with chunks of sweetened cream cheese. One other note - I used homemade pie crust, and only needed a regular 9-inch pie plate. The recipe calls for a deep dish crust, which seems a little excessive for the amount of filling.",

The pumpkin pie flavor simply overpowered the cream cheese. This pie was good but was like any other pumpkin pie I have ever had. With this recipe I expected a positive twist on an old favorite. I brought this pie to a family dinner for 6 adults and had over half of it left at the end of the night. I did make the crust from scratch with plain graham crackers sugar and butter. I highly recommend anyone making any pumpkin pie use a hand made crust. It was the best part of this pie and not difficult at all.",
