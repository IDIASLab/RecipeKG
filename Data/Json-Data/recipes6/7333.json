I pulled it off, sprinkled on more  mozzarella, and cooked for about another 8 minutes, until it was just starting to brown.  In the future, I would cover this casserole with foil for half the time (at least), remove the foil, and then back into the oven, allowing the cheese to melt.  Better yet, I think cooking this at 375 would be even better but, again, covering it with foil for part of the time, so the cheese doesn't burn.  I added the Italian seasoning to the sauce rather than sprinkling on top of the cheese.  A lot of water cooked out of the zucchini, and the bottom of dish was pretty deep with water.  I just poured it off, and then cut into serving sizes.   The Greek yogurt mixed in with the marinara made a really flavorful sauce.  A few tweaks, but it did end up tasting really good.",

I did add sausage to the sauce as we have teenage boys who want meat in everything! Make sure you check it after about 15mins because it does brown rather quickly. I threw a piece of foil over the top at 15mins and kept it in for another 15. This is a winner and will be a staple for years to come. Thank you!",

I sliced the zucchini with my mandolin and saut\u00e9ed it on my cast-iron stovetop griddle.  The next time I will either slice the zucchini thicker or do a double layer between the sauce and cheese, so that it has more structure.  I also added some ham, because I thought the carnivores in my family would be more open-minded to the zucchini noodles that way.  Everyone really liked it!",
