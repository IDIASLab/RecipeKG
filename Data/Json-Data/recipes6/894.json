Doesn t say what kind of almonds to use (whole slivers sliced) but I used the slivers and probably will try with pecans the next time. For the dried fruit I used a combo of cranberries cherries and apricots. I wanted to be sure that the chocolate chips melted a bit so I mixed them in after cooling the granola for 10 minutes rather than 20 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
