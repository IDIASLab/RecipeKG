I made both bread and muffins(doubled the recipe) and they were sooo moist!!! After reading other reviews I read the proportions of ingredients and was quite perplexed as to how this was going to turn out. There did seem to be a bigger proportion of dry ingredients to the liquid. The adjustments I made were: I added the sugar and salt to the apples first to leech out the juice. I also added just a splash of orange juice (maybe two tbsp) and grated some orange rind. I immediately wrapped the bread when it cooled and put in fridge and put the muffins in a plastic container with lid. I couldn't resist the muffins so tried them about an hour later; the bread in the fridge until the next day. Both were so moist and there was no crumbling at all. I think alot depends on the type of apple. When I started slicing into what I had(red delicious) they were quite juicy so I am sure that helped. I also added a bit more cinnamon and a half tsp of nutmeg to the DOUBLE batch I made; would use a quarter tsp. to the single recipe. I also added a tsp of vanilla. I have this bookmarked as I will be using this one again. Presentation is also beautiful with the whole cranberries and chunks of apple.",

Very flavorful and attractive presentation. I'm not sure what the reviewers are doing wrong who believe it needs more liquid. This recipe makes a very stiff batter rather than a soupy one, but coming out of the oven, it is perfect! Next time I'm going to try a little extra cinnamon and about 3/4t salt. But that's just my experimental nature! :-)",

I had to add more and even then there was way more fruit and nuts than \"batter.\" Perhaps the secret lies in letting the apples sit in the sugar for a long time thus drawing out their juices? Maybe that's the secret and why it works to freeze this recipe before baking. That would give enough time for the apple juices to saturate the flour mixture. Definitely a wierd recipe. The bread itself tastes fine but doesn't hold together all that well. I still only give this recipe one star if left as is. If somehow more liquid were added or instructions were added to let the apples and sugar sit for a hour or so I'd give it more.",
