That said, you should know that I \"modified\" it a bit. I used approx 3 Tbsp of lime juice, no zest, 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no garlic (husband hates it). The pepper flakes were a nice touch and you could also use Chinese chili (red) oil for some heat. To make it a dinner salad, I took precooked chicken, tossed it in some soy sauce and about 1/2 tsp of grated fresh ginger and added that, along with a couple of finely chopped green onions. I served it on a bed of chopped romaine lettuce. YUMMY! Thanks so much for the dressing - you made my day.",

I followed it almost exactly except I added sesame seeds instead of the peanuts, honey instead of brown sugar, Asian chili sauce instead of peppers, and some grated ginger.  I also threw in some edamame along with shredded carrots.  Just as good, if not better then the restaurants. UPDATE: two days later and its AMAZING!!! Definitely let it sit as long as you can.

I like more vegetables in this salad. My favorite it to add julienned daikon radish and whole sugar snap peas. I have also added small pieces of aspragus, although they are not so oriental. If you add too many more veggies, you need to make a little more dressing, though. I have made this recipe with salmon, doubled the dressing recipe and used it to marinate the salmon to have the flavors pull through in another dish. It was wonderful!",

I love lime and garlic so I increased it to 3 cloves, and made sure to include all the juice and zest of 1 lime despite other reviews.  I also added a little more cilantro than called for.  It does make a lot, but for a party I would probably double it.  I only put in 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, and that gave it just enough kick for me.\nUpdate- I made this again, with soba noodles found at my local grocery.  They were ones made from buckwheat flour!  I added a little more rice vinegar and soy sauce because I remembered it needed more moisture last time, but the soba noodles don't absorb as much as the angel hair, so there was too much liquid.  It is still delicious though!  I added some green onion this time too, and omitted the nuts.",
