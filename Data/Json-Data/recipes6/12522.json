I made half the recipe (otherwise we would eat them all) and still got many cookies. I used rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats. Instead of adding each individual spice I added 3 tsp (6 in a full recipe) of pumpkin pie spice which comtains; cinnamon ginger nutmeg allspice and cloves. I also added about a cup of raisins. These cookies were gone in a matter of hours. YUM oh and as others said....8 minutes did it for me too.",
