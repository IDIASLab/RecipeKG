It turned out perfect, was soooo simple and fool proof. Works great to spread, pipe or pour. I made this one 7 seperate times before writing review and all were perfect. The taste was right on, it poured over my bundt cakes beautifully and hardened enough to cover within 20 minutes.(cool your cake completely beforehand). The other batches were made for decorating cookies and they too were perfect each time.  One batch is more than enough to lightly spread and generously pipe 2 dozen average sized cookies. ",

I really think that there is a typo when it comes to the milk, it should be tablespoon rather than teaspoon.  The corn syrup is a nice extra if you want it to set nice but it does make it a little too sweet (I love sweet things) I would decrease the sugar to 1 1/4 cup if 1 tbl of corn syrup is added.  It really needed extra vanilla.  I used 1/2 tsp but I would even double that.  It really did need at least 1 tbl of butter.  I would add more.  If you do decrease the powdered sugar take it easy on the milk and add as you go, you can always add more later but there is no way to fix a soupy mess unless you want pure sugar.",

Ensure the cake is very cool before the glaze is drizzled on. The first time i made it it melted off somewhat. I guess i was to impatient and just wanted to eat the cake. I learned my lesson though and it really does turn out fabulous.",
