I bought a little over 3lbs (exactly 6 oxtails) and it fed 2 people with very little leftovers. I did trim my oxtails a little so that I would not end up with a pot of grease. Also I slightly altered the recipe (I always end up doing that) by adding 2 cans of beef broth, doubled both the Greek seasoning and season all, used a little worcestershire sauce in place of browning sauce, and doubled the garlic. Oh and I cooked for 3 hours(TENNNDER). The gravy is sooo good. I served this with Jamaican style rice and peas and fried plantains (from this site). I will post a pic soon of this wonderful dish. It certainly is a soul food blast from the past. Thanks so much for posting this!!!",

A few  tips...BEFORE adding garlic, onions and dry seasonings in step 1, bring the oxtails to a boil and skim off the gray scum that comes to the top, then add seasonings.  This makes for a clearer, purer tasting broth.  Also, if time permits, refrigerate broth overnight when the oxtails are cooked.  The next day the layer of fat will have hardened and can be removed completely...so much healthier and and the flavors marry overnight for better taste.  I also omitted the additional teaspoon of seasoning salt since my broth was just fine with the 1 tablespoon of salt.",

It is best to boil them first, to get rid of some of the fat. They will still have fat on them. Add tomatoes if you like or whatever! Normally, it ends up \"stew-like\" because of the cooking time and gravy. The meat should fall off the bone when eaten. I would love to hear other variations as far as gravy or sauce. I myself can't help but eat oxtails swimming in gravy! If you are overly concerned about the fat...don't make it. Thanks! Great recipe!",

I'd like to share at tip from a Julia Child cookbook -- place oxtails in a baking pan, add 1 carrot, 1 rib celery and 1/2 onion with skins - all chopped coarsely.  Place on rack in top third of oven preheated to 450 degrees.  Bake for 40 minutes, turning and basting every 10 minutes.  This eliminates the browning in oil and spatters.  Drain and pour off fat, deglaze pan with water or red wine and proceed with recipe.",
