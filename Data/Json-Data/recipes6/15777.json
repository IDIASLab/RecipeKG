The recipe using the Kings Hawaiian Bread came out perfect. The sweetness of the bread complements the recipe perfectly and the bread is also dense enough to absorb the juice from the pineapple and thick enough for cubing. This recipe has become a staple at our Thanksgiving table year after year. We omit the salt and pepper when served with ham there's plenty of salt.",

Only diff in recipe is about 3/4c. brown sugar instead of white 1 stick butter (really should be butter not margarine for ultimate flavor) and no seasonings. We melt butter in bottom of dish mix everything else and pour over the butter. Because of it's richness and my lack of self-control this is a rare treat when it's not for social functions.",
