The bread is wonderful and is very attractive to wrap in cellophane and give in a gift bag.  I tweeked the recipe a little, at the suggestion of some other readers.  I used 1 1/2 cup of RIPE bananas.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  As a finishing touch, I mixed a tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of sugar and about 1/4 cup of oatmeal flakes and then sprinkled them on the top.  It is delicious and moist!",

Use lots of extra banana, especially if you are generous with the nuts - they seem to cut a little of the banana-ness from the flavor (I doubled the recipe and poured the first loaf without nuts before adding them to the batter for the second loaf. The no-nut version, although the very same batter, was much more banana-ier!).  I also followed the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and sprinkled the batter with extra oatmeal before baking - what a pretty touch!  We will definitely use this recipe again.",

My old recipe turned out a dense, drier type of loaf that usually ended up too brown and too crumbly.  I surfed onto this recipe and gave it a shot.  WOW!  This is an awesome bread!  I love the texture as well as the taste. The addition of the oats is a big plus too.  I added a bit (1/4 tsp.) of cinnamon to my batter, and topped it with a brown sugar/oats/cinnamon struesel type of topping.  It turned out great, and I am making another loaf in the morning!  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  It is quick, easy, and sensational.  Thanks for the recipe and God bless!",

I added twice the nuts (a full 1 cup).  I took the suggestion of some and turned the oven down to 325*F.  I made muffins and after 23 minutes they were perfect!  I also used the topping another reviewer suggested: 1/8 cup oats, 1 tbsp brown sugar, and 1 tsp cinnamon.  They were soo pretty with the oats on top!  Thank you!",
