The drying overnight allows for the cookie to develop a crust on top so it crisps when baking. Looks kind of like a stubby mushroom after it is baked. Texture will harden as the day goes by. Reminds me of a German Springerle cookie.",

When I make them, I always line the cookie sheets with aluminum foil, but it's important to put the shiny side down so that the cookie sits on the dull side.  Otherwise, the shiny aluminum will reflect too much heat and burn the cookies.  If you do this, you don't need to grease your sheets and the cookies will easily peel off the foil once they're cool.  Thanks for sharing a great old recipe.",
