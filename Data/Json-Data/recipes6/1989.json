                "reviewBody": "I made this but instead of individual tarts i did so as one pie-sized tart. The taste is delicious but with the increased size/ and the high altitute I live at I had to compensate as the tart was far too liquidous if following the recipe and would never set. I increased the baking time to 37 minutes on the lowest oven rack with the crust shielded to prevent over-browning. if done in pie-size I recommend using a glass pie tin (not a aluminum one) use shortening/crisco on the pie plate and sprinkle with flower before putting the crust down so the bottom crust isn't soggy and pulls out when served easier. to help it set 2 tsp of cornstarch will do the trick. Also if your blackberries are sweet rather than tart i'd recommend mixing some cranberries in for tartness (about a cup) and using 1 tsp of vanilla instead of a tablespoon otherwise it's too sweet. let set at least 2 hours overnight is better. Also When I made it I did not mash the baerries and lemon zest together as the recipe suggests i stirred gently it ends up for a prettier (and more colorful-if you add cranberries) tart and has a better texture I think.",
