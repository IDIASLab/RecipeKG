From apple cakes to pumpkin cookies to cranberry-walnut cupcakes, this is my go-to frosting to capture the flavors of my favorite season. I like to top it with chopped walnuts and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Be warned, however, that it's extremely sweet, so it's best paired with low-sugar baked goods. A little goes a long way.",
