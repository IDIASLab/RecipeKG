I doubled up on the sauce and added a cup of chicken broth, because I used real marsala wine and using that alone gave it a real strong liquor taste.  I also used a combination of fresh mushrooms and baby portabella mushrooms.  Instead of cornstarch, I used Wondra flour for sauces that you can just sprinkle in to thicken it.  I also pounded the chicken to make it real thin.  We have an Italian restaurant near us that we always go to to get this dish and my daughter raved that mine was even better.  I served it with penne pasta with marinara sauce.  Thanks for this excellent recipe, I know I will be making it alot.",
