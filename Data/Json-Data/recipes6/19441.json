Next in the Ninja a cup of no fat milk and three tablespoons of natural peanut butter then added it to the saucepan with the spinach buttermilk. I didn't have cumin seeds so I used powdered also I didn't have serrano peppers so substituted one teaspoon of powdered Mexican arbol peppers. I tried cooking the powdered cumin and peppers in olive oil but in hindsight would have just added them to the saucepan with one tablespoon of olive oil. I mixed the corn starch with the water then added that with the sugar to the saucepan. I stirred constantly to boiling expecting the cornstarch to make the soup somewhat thicker. It was a little hotter than my wife could stand so again in hindsight I would bump the pepper down to half a teaspoon.",
