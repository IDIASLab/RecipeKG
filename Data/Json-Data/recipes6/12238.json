This sounded like it could taste close to the ones in the grocery store....and BOY does it! I did however add 2 cups of raisins which I boiled for about 5 minutes and \"sqooshed\" the water out of. This is a definite keeper! VERY YUMMY!(A warning about the icing though....don't overcook it!) Next time I will do the icing correctly and I think I will throw on a few chopped nuts for decoration. Thank you so much!!!",
