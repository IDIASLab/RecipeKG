                "reviewBody": "Using this for teacher gifts.  Was planning on using my favorite recipe from the Fanny Farmer Baking Book for the bread, but noticed that the ingredients were almost identical so I used this one instead.  I omitted the cloves (don't like them much) and after reading from another reviewer that the bread had tasted a little too spicy.  Cut back a little on the cinnamon too.  I also used cooking spray to grease the inside of the jars.  After filling half-full I placed the jars directly on the rack (as another person suggested).  They came out perfect and the recipe is delicious!  If when taking them out of the oven you noticed that they've popped out of the jar a little you can carefully (with gloves of course) press the top of the bread down gently so that the sides are away from the seal.  I made sure that the rim was clean and even with them being quite full they all sealed perfectly.  Found the pint-size wide mouth jars by where I live for only 5.99 for a dozen at Big Lots.  Plan on decorating them with 7\" round pieces of material with ribbons and will print out gift tags to attach with a note to heat for less than 30 seconds in the microwave so they will slide right out and be ready for slicing.  Will definitely make them again, plan on buying more mason jars and storing them for holiday baking!  Hope this review helps...all the others did for me as well!",

I found the jars at Wal-Mart, since I know a few of you were having trouble finding them. I also reduced the cloves from 1 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. Like another reviewer, I scaled the recipe to make 12 jars. As an experiment, I cooked 6 jars at a time, the first time with a cookie sheet, the second time without. The bread cooked with the cookie sheet turned out just fine, however, the ones cooked without the sheet look more golden brown on the outside (the others were darker). Also, HELPFUL HINT!!, I figured out a super easy way to get the batter into the jars: pour the batter into a heavy gallon freezer bag and cut a small hole in the corner of the bag. This way, you can pipe the batter right into the jars. No mess! Thanks, this recipe is great. Can't wait for gift-giving this year! Next time I'll try pumpkin.",

In heaven from eating some still warm slides after dinner! It was very easy to pipe batter into the jar with a gallon size bag with a hole cut in the corner. I used 1 cup of batter in each jar and it cooked perfectly up to the top without going over in about 45 minutes. After about 10 minutes being sealed I heard the \"ping/pop\" noise that it's supposed to make. Haven't tried getting it out of the jars yet, but it doesn't look like it'll be a problem. What a fun idea, thank you! I will definitely make the banana bread and give these out for the holidays.",

I greased the insides of the jars with shortening,filled them half way up and they baked right to the top perfectly. The only change I made was that I used cinnamon pecans. The bread slides right out of the jar when cooled. Oh so easy, oh so good. Will be baking more of these again soon. Oh, and I have read about baking in jars. Some places claim you can keep them as long as normal jarred items (like months and years!). This is incorrect. You must eat just as  Linda states, within a week. Fun gift and presentation. Thanks for sharing Linda!",

This is a WONDERFUL recipe for banana bread! I have made two batches so far to give away as gifts. I cut a 7 inch circle with pinking shears out of a fabric with Christmas designs. I unscrewed the jar ring (after completely sealed and cooled) and laid it on the lid and screwed the ring back on. A ribbon or raffia bow tied around the ring with a gift tag is all it needs to complete the presentation of the gift.",
