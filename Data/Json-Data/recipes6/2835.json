My only issue with the recipe, is that it was way too thick for me--I don't think it needed to simmer 10-15 minutes at the end as stated, half that time would have been fine. I ended up adding almost another full cup of milk to get it nice and creamy again. I also thought it needed to be a tad sweeter and added another tablespoon of honey. Thanks so much for the idea of mixing rice and quinoa--I will definitely try this again!",
