The only thing I would change is that I wouldn't puree everything.  We like our chowder a little chunkier, so I'll leave corn, potato and onion chunks aside when I puree next time.  But I'll definitely make it again.  My husband is a very confirmed meat/dairy eater and he had no idea this was vegan.  I served it in bread boules for the adults and made mini-boules for the kids out of rolls.  Fun, easy and warm/spicy on a cold New England night.",

I didn't have red chilis so I subbed a small can of green chilis. I will definately make again and drain the corn and half the broth.",
