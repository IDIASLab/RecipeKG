Next time I will buy the spiciest pepperoni I can find (maybe even pepperettes) because once mixed with the dough the meat loses a lot of it's flavour also would be good with a few sun dried tomato's and more garlic. I used the bread maker to the second rise and then removed the dough divided it and it made 24 dinner rolls (let it rise again) - baked at 350 for 20 minutes and everyone loved it. P.S. Tried this a second time with turkey pepperettes (the little individual pepperoni sticks) and did not like it as much. I cut them in 1 inch pieces and they did not disintegrate like the previous try but instead the thick skin of the pepperettes stayed in tact while the meat disolved overall not appealing. I will stick to the regular sliced pepperoni and just get the spiciest one I can find.",

Next I beat it down and allowed it to rise again. After allowing the dough to rise the second time I rolled it out and covered it with sliced pepperoni a little more shredded cheddar and bacon bits. I rolled it together pinched the ends and allowed it to rise in the loaf pan and then baked it at 350 degrees. I used a garlic and herb cheddar cheese it was so flavorful!",

After the 2nd rise I rolled out the dough into a rectangle sprinkled the cheese and pepperoni ( I only needed 8oz could not imagine 16) then rolled the dough up pinching the ends under. The dough was then placed in a lighty greased 9x5 loaf pan to rise again (45 min). This bread was baked for 15 minutes at 350 I then took the bread out and topped it with a little cheese and pepperoni for decoration. Placed the bread back in the oven for approximately 7 minutes. Can't wait to make again.",
