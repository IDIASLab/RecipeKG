Making this even better, I had fresh ripe, sweet pineapple.  I put it in my food processor and then squeezed it out using 2 coffee filters and that worked better than the collander.  I used 1 packed cup of pineapple.  I added to the batter:  1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. rum extract, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  This made 6 Texas-size muffins baked at 37 minutes.  *careful though, these really poof up, so next time I will use less batter and make 7 giant size muffins.  This would also be great with a few marichino cherries chopped with the pineapple, almost like an upside downcake concept.  The streusel topping is great.  I didn't have enough butter for both topping and batter, so used oil in the batter.  They were not dry at all.  They look oh so gourmet.  I also didn't melt the margarine for the streusel, just cut it in with a pastry blender. These really have a bakery look.",

I did not bother saving the pinapple to spoon over the top, I folded the pineapple in the muffin batter with the rest of the wet ingredients. This recipe turned out a very pretty muffin that was quite moist, though a little on the sweet side for us. The crumb topping was quite good with the pineapple flavor, we just didn't care for the combination of cinnamon and pineapple. That's not the recipe's issue, it's our own personal taste. I'd like to play with this recipe a bit and see if I can't cut back on the sugar, add a little more pineapple and maybe make this a little healthier as we all really liked pineapple in a muffin. It was quite tasty! EDITED: I have made this three times now without the cinnamon the last two times and we really love these muffins. The flavor is almost like an upside down pineapple cake only without all the work!",

Mine turned out having almost the texture and taste of a cupcake. I didn't change much but after reading the other reviews, I sliced about 2 Tbsp pineapple chunks which I added to the batter and didn't melt the butter for the topping but used room temp instead. Thanks!   **Update - I made these again and without thinking, I melted the butter for the topping like the instructions say. The tops of the muffins came out hard and crunchy but when I used room temp butter the next time, the tops were soft and came out just perfect. So it's the melted butter that makes the difference.**",

Given some of the reviews that led me to think these muffins might be mediocre, I was unsure of what I'd end up with but I needn't have worried - I was pleased. Also given that some reviewers had a problem with these being dry and/or sticking to the muffin liners, I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the batter which apparently took care of the problem because the liners peeled off easily to reveal a light and fluffy muffin that was moist, pleasantly sweet and delicately pineapple flavored. I did add the pineapple to the batter as I didn't like the idea of plopping it on the top, preferring the pineapple flavor to be in the muffin itself.  The topping is a little different, crunchy but not hard. Next time, however, I think I'll skip melting the butter.  A really delightful muffin and quite refreshing for \"I'm Sick of Winter\" malaise.",
