When I was serving the stew though the bottom half of the pumpkin was still hard and not fully cooked. Make sure to check the pumpkin near the middle.",

Try adding pumpkin seeds on top. Thanks!",

You must either use instant rice or precook your rice otherwise it wont be done. I cooked it for the full 3 hours. Also I used a carving pumpkin because all the pie pumpkins we very small and this makes ALOT! You should also use a very deep pan to cook this in bacause the pumpkin gets very soft and there is alot of juice. One sugesstion was to use 1 cup crushed tomato and 3 cups tomato sauce instead of the juice which I did and I think it turned out better that it would have with the juice.I have to say though it is VERY YUMMY I will make it again!!!",
