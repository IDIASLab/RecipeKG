There were a couple of tips from previous reviewers that are worthwhile for any fudge recipe from scratch: heat it to boiling slowly over medium or med-low heat; let it cool all the way before you begin beating it; wipe down sides before you beat it. I would add to these suggestions - make sure you don't cook it past the soft-ball stage or 234 degrees (I found boiling for 5 minutes was just a tad too long) and after it's cooled don't beat it too long - you can go past that perfect fudgey texture to something grainier if you do.",

The second time I did cover the pan and must've cooked it past the soft ball stage because it ended up dry and I had to throw it away. I found the reviews for this and the other old fashioned recipe helpful concerning avoiding sugar crystals and when to stir and not to stir. Also I tested for \"soft ball\" stage the old-fashioned way; it doesn't really form a ball by itself - you have to form it into a ball in the water but you can easily flatten it when you remove it from the water. After this I ran out of unsweetened chocolate so I tried the other old-fashioned fudge recipe (the one using cocoa powder) and it took forever. I will make this recipe again!",
