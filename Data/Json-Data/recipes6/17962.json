Love the contrast of the tart cranberries with the sweet ice cream. It is time consuming especially over the holidays but I have found it can be easily parceled out over a few days. I'll make & freeze the crust on Monday do the ice cream layer on Tuesday add the whipped cream & nuts on Wednesday and sit back & enjoy it after the turkey dinner on Thursday. That way it's just 5 - 10 minutes per day - much easier to fit in during a hectic time of year.",
