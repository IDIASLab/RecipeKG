I substituted rolled oats to quick-cooking oat just because I prefer the nutty flavor from rolled. Also, I increased butter to 1/2 cup because after mixing the ingredients together, the topping wasn't crumbly enough to my liking. I decreased salt and used a pinch instead since I don't cook with much salt. \nOh one more thing; I used a fresh pineapple therefore not too much juice so what I did is added 1 tbsp. of pineapple juice from a container...don't do that! I had to cook it much longer on the stove top to reduce the liquid. Next time, I won't add any juice at all and let the fruit extract their own juices instead.",
