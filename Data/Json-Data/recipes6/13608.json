                "reviewBody": "This recipe makes very authentic tasting pies, although I did alter the applesauce recipe because I like mine to be really chunky and spiced with nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  I also used brown sugar (1/2 c. packed dark brown) in place of white sugar.  The applesauce has a slightly spicier and richer flavor this way.  I also would suggest piercing the pies with a fork before frying to help aid in cooking the whole way through and preventing steam from building up inside and creating large air bubbles.  Making good pie crust is essential to having a good pie.  Butter crusts usually have a stronger, flakier flavor and texture if that is what you prefer.  Make sure you don't overwork the crust or mix it too much or it will become tough and bland.  Add the water a little bit at a time (about a Tbsp at a time), just until there is enough water to hold the dough together.  Also make sure the water is ice cold to help keep the butter or shortening from softening up.  Anyone who had difficulty getting the crust the cook the entire way through without becoming very dark and crisp on the outside should try rolling the dough thinner.  An eighth of an inch is less than you might think.  If you have made the dough well it will roll out and hold together.  However, keep in mind that the more time you roll out the dough, the tougher it will be once cooked.",

I melted butter in a stoneware pan, coated the pies on both sides and baked 5 minutes on each side.  They turned out awesome, they were slightly buttery and less fattening.  My husband said they were just like his mother's, which was the result I was looking for.",

They also free from all the preservatives, flavor modifiers and colors those guys put in.\r\n\r\nI made some changes to the filling - I added 1 tsp butter to saute apples and at the end I added 1 tbs of flour mixed with 1 cup of water. I cooked that down on low heat for 5 minutes and got that nice, cinammony goopy sauce that pours out when you bit it!\r\n\r\nEverybody in the family ate two.. wanted more but they were gone.\r\n\r\nhappy cooking :)",

After making two loaves of bread I wasn't in the mood to make yet another dough, so I took out a can of Grands flaky biscuits, rolled each one out and filled with the apples. I also used two tablespoons of butter while cooking my apples, didn't mash them and used more cinnamon. These were absolutely incredible! I think I'll try this recipe with peaches next time. Thanks for a great idea!!!!",

I've been looking for a recipe to make similar ones at home and here it is! \nThese pies came out DELICIOUS!!!\nThe pie dough came out perfect! They were golden and crunchy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. I used butter instead of shortening though for extra flavour.\nI changed the filling recipe to the mock McDonalds one - chunky apples, with more cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, lemon zest and a touch of cornstarch with lemon juice for thickening.\nI'm DEFINITELY making these pies again!!! Even better flavour and at a fraction of the price of the McDonald's ones :D Thanks to the author for this recipe!!!!",
