I will make a couple of changes next time: one can of coconut milk and half a can of water (rather than 2 cans of coconut milk) I will use fresh veggies and only yellow red and orange colored ones - I had some green veggies in my frozen mixture and they turned the soup a slightly unattractive yellow/brownish color. Otherwise my kids enjoyed this as much as I did. I served it with fresh biscuits.",
