Next time I'll try the topping as 1 cup semi sweet chips & 1 cup milk chocolate chips and see if that's closer to the taste. Good recomendations of others- spray dish w/ pam have crackers ready in the dish and refridgerate after assebmling to have it set. Very easy & very yummy everyone at my office loved them.

I used rectangular Keebler Club\u00ae Crackers and the milk/semi-sweet choc. combo as suggested. It seemed like a lot of chocolate as I was pouring it on top but it really needed that thick layer to balanced the bottom layers. Be sure to press the cracker layers together to keep it from being crumbly. I kept them in the fridge for days and  the crackers didn't get soft at all. (Note: I made these again for a different crowd, this time using ritz crackers. The layers didn't stick together and nobody liked them. They were a crumbly mess and crackers were soft on the second day.)",
