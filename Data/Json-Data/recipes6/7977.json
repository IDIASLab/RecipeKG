I ONLY USE FRESH LEMON NOW AND CAN REALLY NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS SPREAD IS PERFECT FOR A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G!!! USE IT ON STEAK SANDWICHES (I SLATHERED SOME ON TERA'S PHILLY CHEESESTEAK SAMIES), CRAB CAKES, FOR DIPPING FRENCH FRIES - YOU GET THE POINT! Pretty good! Made this to \"slather\" on Meatball Sandwiches (BIGGUY728). A fast food join my fiance and I frequent makes a GREAT meatball sub. What makes it SOOOOOO yummy is the garlic spread on it. This was perfect for that! I was worried about using 2 1/2 T lemon juice (thought it was a typo), but went with it and am glad I did. It really perks this up! This was so good, I can't WAIT for my next excuse to whip up a batch lol. Thanks for sharing your FANTASTIC recipe, Jeff and Justine! :-)",
