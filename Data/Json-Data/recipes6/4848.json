Had a chile pepper I had to use up so added that too.  My substitutions:  Used lite coconut milk and 1 can of black beans and 1 can of white beans (all I had).  I found the flavor outstanding and the beautiful thing is that you just throw all the ingredients in the pot and more or less walk away until it's done.  So simple.  Will add this to my regular repertoire.  Thanks for sharing it.",

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the amount of spices.  I was concerned with the large amount of ginger, cumin and turmeric in such a small batch of soup, so I erred on the side of caution and ended up using about 2tsp of each spice instead of 1 tbsp.  Even though I used less, the spices were very overpowering.  I couldn't taste the ginger, however the cumin dominated everything and the turmeric made the soup bitter.  I would highly recommend starting out with 1tsp of each spice and adding more later if necessary.  Someone else suggested adding lemon juice and I think that would be a great idea.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Becky. I think with a few spice tweaks, it would be quite tasty.",

I didn't have the tomatoes, so I added 14 ounces of salsa and 2 ounces of tomatillo sauce.  I diced up 2 medium size carrots, and I also added the juice from 1.5 limes and a sprinkle of dried red chili peppers and sprinkled some chili powder in it.  It turned out great.  This was such an easy soup to make and will be a regular in my kitchen.  If I could give it a higher rating, I would!!!",
