It was too sweet for my taste too gooey (when I cut the cake the goo oozed down the sides instead of remaining firm) and there was just too much goo for the amount of crust. I'll definitely use the crust recipe in the future but I'm still searching for the perfect goo. I suspect most bakeries here in St. Louis use a cream cheese variation.",

The \"goo\" is very tasty but was way too runny. The crust made by the goo on the very top was excellent though.
