I added an extra scoop of sour cream trying to reduce the amount I had left. I also added in a pinch of cinnamon and pumpkin pie because I read it was kinda bland. So the cake was very moist. The chocolate chips went to the bottom so I flipped the piece of cake so the melted chips were like frosting but on the inside. Will be making it many times!!",

I didn't want to look for another recipe so I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder and about another 1/3 cup of sour cream. Mine turned out nice and light and chocolatley and not crumbly like alot of cakes. I did not do the topper on here either. Since it was cupcakes I made a cream cheese icing. Was sooooo yummy with the icing.",
