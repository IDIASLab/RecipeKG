Tip1: Seeing as there are some users who found this recipe too sweet make sure you taste your marshmallows before you use them so you can adjust the sweetness of your icing. In my case I used really sweet ones so i lessened the sugar to 2/3 cup and omitted the corn syrup. Tip2: follow the procedure as written and make sure you cook the egg whites sugar and water over the double boiler till it peaks. Beat it continuously as instructed. If you add in the marshmallows too soon it'll be as flat as hot marshmallow fluff from a jar... Tip3:you can add another cup of marshmallows if you wish... I used 30pcs of the big ones. I know it doesn't measure the same but i'm pretty sure it's more than a cup. In my experience more marshmallows = better viscosity especially if you want to pipe it on. So overall this recipe was exactly what i was looking for but the sugar level needed a little adjusting to my taste... mmm fluffy marshmallow goodness... cheers!",

I halved the recipe but then I got confused and used 2 egg whites anyway. I also didn't have any marshmallows so I used Fluff instead (I compensated by using a bit less sugar because the fluff is sweet). Then I misread about cooking and whipping it over rapidly boiling water I just had it over simmering water. But even so it came out very nice and fluffy I was so surprised! And it wasn't too sweet either. I absolutely loved it and it is perfect as a low-fat filling for a low-fat whoopie pie recipe that I've been working on. Thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic! definitely not too sweet (as one reviewer complained). Butter cream icing is far sweeter. This is just gooier and fluffier - I loved it! It can be flavoured too - eg. I used 1tsp of orange liquor (instead of vanilla) and also added about 1 Tbs of orange zest while it was boiling and used it to ice a round double layer 9\" chocolate cake - Yum! Next time I will make 1.5x the recipe though as it would have been nice to have a thicker layer of icing. One tip: if you are icing a double layer cake allow the middle icing layer to set for 5-10 minutes in the fridge before putting on the top layer. Put a lid on the icing in the pot and leave it over the hot water (without the heat on) so it doesn't set while you're waiting.",
