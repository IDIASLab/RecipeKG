I have a tangerine tree in the backyard that is overflowing with fruit right now so it's a perfect time to make this decadent cake. I'm sure you could make it with fresh oranges but tangerine juice will take it over the top. I squeezed 4 medium-sized tangerines and baked the cake for 50 minutes. Use a toothpick to poke holes all around the top of the cake and be patient in pouring the syrup over the top of the cake. Let it soak it and then repeat until it's all gone. This is what will make your cake so moist it'll nearly melt in your mouth.",

The batter made 4 mini bundt cake pans sprayed with pam plus 10 mini muffins. I did take the mini muffins out sooner than the other cakes. I also used the tangelo juice with \"powdered\" sugar and not granulated sugar as a glaze. I brushed this on after they cooled and popped the cakes out of their pans. Next time I will grease and flour the mini bundt pans to get a better release. The small amount of overflow batter on the edges of the panx made them a bit tougher to get out (it took some time but I did). Will definately make these again since they were light moist and very tasty!",
