All the other recipes I tried were made with brown sugar and didn't have that true butterscotch flavor you get from caramelizing the sugar with the butter and cream. It took about 15 minutes of stirring to get that nice brown color but it was well worth the time. The filling set up nicely overnight in the refrigerator and sliced into nice pieces. My father and I both thank you for posting this great recipe.",
