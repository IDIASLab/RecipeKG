Whip up some of this simple adult ice cream, crawl into a hammock, close your eyes, and you just might feel like you are somewhere in the Caribbean. Okay, maybe not, but it's worth a shot and the ice cream is delicious. The hardest part is the wait. Argh, matey! Garnish with additional cubed mango or other fruit of your choice, if desired. Hmmm...we only have one kind here. I used Kensington Pride mangos (green skin). They are about the size of a large pear.",
