The recipe says to take them out when the edges turn a light brown, but in my experience the edges never changed color.  I was afraid I was going to underbake them so I kept waiting for them to change and they didn't.  I finally took them out and the overbaked product was crumbly.  With the next batch I just took them out at 9 minutes and they turned out great.  So watch your time, not the edges!",

I followed other people's suggestions and did the following:\n\nUsed 3/4 cup oats in place of 3/4 cup flour.\nUsed both wheat and white flour.\n1/4 cup honey to substitute the brown sugar.\nPressed fork crisscross into cookies 7 minute into baking.  Let bake 2 minutes more after that.\n\nThe cookie dough is much runnier than regular pbutter cookie dough, but don't worry!  It is supposed to be that way.  Because of this you really cannot \"roll\" them.  You just have to place them by rounded teaspoons onto the pan.  \n\nAside from what I wrote above, I followed the recipe.  I know someone else mentioned that they used butter, but I used margarine (SmartBalance) and it worked fine.\n\nThank you for this recipe! They are soft and delicious.",

After cooling they are crisp on the outside soft on the inside. They do seem like they could become crunchy cookies in a day or so though.",
