After the cake came out of the oven I poked holes in it using a toothpick and then poured a mixture of brown sugar and butter over it.

I made this cake a few days ago and unfortunately I dropped it on the floor as I was taking it out of the oven, so I was not able to make the topping or even taste the cake(even though my kids ate the parts that was still in the pan and raved over it.) But I made it again tonight following some of the additions from previous reviews. I followed the review that suggested using heavy cream and vanilla in the topping, which was fantastic. However I also mixed my apple pieces with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon then let them sit while I prepared the cake mix. I only added 1/2 cup of coconut because I was concerned that the cake would come out dry and crumbly as stated by another review...oh and I substituted pecans for the walnuts and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to my batter. At any rate I was more than thoroughly pleased with the results. The cake is very rich and moist, and because I love warm cake I poured the topping  on while it was warm and tasted a piece..FANTABULOUS! The only thing I would say otherwise is that maybe my apples were too big,the recipe calls for two apples and I felt that maybe I could have used one, but my fiancee' who loves apples disagrees.",
