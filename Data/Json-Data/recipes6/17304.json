I didn't use anything to top it, but it would be great with a cream cheese frosting. I will do that next time. My husband took some back to work with him to share with his work buddies.

I had some old (we only eat crunchy) apples laying around and I peeled them cored them and threw them in the crock pot with some spices and OJ for a couple of hours mashed with potato masher and had applesauce galore. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I always try to cut down on the sugar and the oil. I used half the sugar (raw) and half the oil (coconut) as well as replaced one cup of white flour with whole wheat I found in the freezer. It turned out sweet enough. I made a double batch and 5 kids devoured it. The texture was airy and cake like moist and absolutely a keeper on anyone's healthy dessert or breakfast menu. Easy to assemble the day before (at least dry ingr) and very forgiving. Enjoy it!",
