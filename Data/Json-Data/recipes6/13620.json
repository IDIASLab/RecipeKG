Since I didn't have the time to work with fresh cherries, both times I have made this I have used 2-3 cans of Oregon Fruit Products\u00ae pitted red tart cherries in water. Make sure you drain the cherries thoroughly. I also opted to use Pillsbury\u00ae refrigerated pie crust. The pie got rave reviews, and people were astonished that the cherries were canned and the pie crust was not homemade - that's how fresh this pie tasted. Last but not least, using the canned cherries and a ready-to-go pie crust made this recipe a snap to make!",

If you transfer the cups to pounds, you'll have a perfect pie. Thanks Beth!",

I used 3 cans of Oregon Fruit tart cherries and drained them really well.  I omitted the extract entirely.  I used Pillsbury pie crust which made making these a snap.  You really have to boil the filling or it won't thicken.  This tends to mash up the cherries, so I might add the third can late in the cooking process to keep some of their shape.  I can hardly wait to make this again!  Yum yum!",

I used a cup of almond flour (available at health food stores & Trader Joe's - or just grind almonds with a little powdered sugar or cornstarch in order to get it as fine as you can). I always use half butter, half Crisco in my crusts. I doubled the filling, because I like a big fat pie. I cooked 3/4 of the cherries & juice, and stirred in the rest of the raw cherries afterward. I used a good Kirschwasser instead of almond extract because I realized I had run out of extract. Made a lattice crust. Served with lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream. Gorgeous.",

Also since I don't have alot of counter space used Pilsbury crust, so brushed it with egg white mixed with sugar and apple pie spice.  Made the crust shiny and added some flavor.

Glad I used this recipe thanks to all the reviews as well. I only made 2 modifications to the recipe: Definitely need to get more cherries than the recipe calls for. I used 3 14.5oz canned Oregon tart cherries in water plus added a handful of frozen (but defrosted) dark sweet cherries that I had in my fridge for making smoothies. Next time I will use 2 cans tart cherries and 2 cans (or equivalent) sweet cherries. The sweet cherries added the punch of sweetness needed to balance the tartness. Drained the cherries well to take out any liquid since it produces a lot when cooking. Used 1/2cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar to taper the sweetness (since i added sweet cherries). And used my favorite pie crust: Ruths' Grandma's Pie Crust which I brushed with egg wash (on the bottom crust and top). Also, when the pie was done, I brushed the lattice weave top crust with a light corn syrup wash sprinkled with granulated sugar and put it back in the oven to set for 3 mins (per tips from allrecipes). It came out beautifully AND everyone loved it! Even people who never liked or had cherry pie raved about it! So proud of my 1st cherry pie! I only had a sliver, it was gone before I knew it! And that sliver was DELISH! 4 stars because of modifications and needing to figure out the right amount of cherries to use.  ",
