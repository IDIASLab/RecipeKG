The pesto was delicious using nutritional yeast. I did not feel like I was missing the parmesan cheese.  I felt it was a little too salty though and would cut down on the amount of salt next time. I wanted a little more garlic flavor and would toss in an extra clove next time as well. Both of these changes aren't significant though as it's just a personal taste preference and easy to modify. Overall, delicious recipe for Spaghetti Squash and the Pesto is one I would make again. Thank you for the recipe!",
