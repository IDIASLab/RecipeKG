I chose to use hot breakfast sausage.  Next time I would probably double the green chiles and add them to the egg mixture rather than to the top.  I also might consider adding some saut\u00e9ed onion or cubing the bread and pouring the egg mixture over it rather than just lining the bottom.  Minor suggestions, though, and this was an all-around solid breakfast choice.",

This was a simple, easy to follow recipe that is quite satisfying. If you like doing \u201cbreakfast for dinner\u201d this would also be a great idea. Adding some salsa to the top was a hit as well. I was a little nervous about not preheating the oven. Have no fear, in 1 hour, your casserole will be cooked through and ready to devour once it\u2019s cooled! Thanks for a great recipe!",
