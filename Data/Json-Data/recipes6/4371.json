When assembling the dish, distribute 1/2 the cream sauce over the pasta on the bottom before adding the layer of meat sauce (then add the rest of the pasta and cover with the rest of the cream sauce).  I find that at least a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in the meat sauce gives the dish a more traditional flavor, although in reviews of other versions on this site suggest it is challenging to those having it for the first time.",

I made this for dinner last night and she said that it was excellent!  I thought that was a great compliment coming from a Greek!  Everyone loves this, even my picky husband and teenage son and they are always looking for any leftovers.  My son requests this and now I can make it myself just like Yiayia's!  I used Muellers ready cut ziti pasta.  When assembling I mixed all of the pasta with the meat sauce and poured into the pan, then topped with the cream sauce.  I sprinkled the top with fresh ground nutmeg.  This definately is worth the effort and everyone does love this dish!  This is a family favorite and I will be making this often!  Everyone should try this dish!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!",

And it smells fabulous!\n\nI did make a number of changes - Reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese and egg added to the pasta at the beginning (didn't miss it); Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the meat (highly suggest doing this); Increased the amount of garlic added to the meat (my MO for almost every recipe); Used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and used dry parsley instead of fresh (didn't notice either change); Added feta cheese to the cream sauce (I have no idea if this made a difference, just following a reviewer's suggestion). I also followed a reviewer's suggestion and tossed half the pasta with a little bit of the cream sauce and tossed the other half of the pasta with the meat sauce. Then first put the cream sauce-tossed pasta in the dish, then the meat sauce-tossed pasta, and finally the rest of the cream sauce. Came out great (seemed like a logical suggestion to me, thus why I followed it).",

It's not my favorite version; I found the cream sauce way too starchy and pasty. I also thought tossing the pasta with butter & parmesan made it a little too heavy and rich-tasting. I prefer making a cream sauce using feta cheese, and tossing half the pasta with that; toss the remaining pasta with the meat sauce (like another poster, I also recommend using ground lamb or half lamb, half beef). Layer the cheese-sauced pasta in the bottom of the baking dish, top with the meat sauce layer, and spread the remaining cream sauce on top. Sprinkle with more crumbled feta and bake.

Well I am glad I made it-sooo delicious. I used the meatloaf mix(beef pork and veal) instead of all ground beef and used only 1/2 of a large onion and 3 cloves of garlic for the meat sauce. For the cream sauce I did use 2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream-hey it is a fattening dish already-why not completely clog the arteries! And made the rest as stated-although I did forget the final sprinkle of parmesan cheese at the end-oops no big deal. Made the night before and just cooked the next day and it was so worth the efforts. Lots of compliments and lots of people wanting the recipe. THANKS!",
