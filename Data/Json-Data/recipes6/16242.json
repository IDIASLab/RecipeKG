I gave it 4 stars because the muffins weren't as flavorful as I had hoped but still pretty good. The next time I make them I will try adding 1/2 cup of sugar and increase the cinnamon to 2-3 tsp. With those minor adjustments I think this would easily be a 5 star recipe! These were really simple to make. If you use muffin pans instead it will take longer to bake than most muffin recipes but I forgot to watch the time so just watch them closely.",
