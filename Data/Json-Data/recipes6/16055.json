You can mix and match they type of chocolate you use depending on what you have on hand. I used milk chocolate chips instead of cutting up the squares. They have a fantastic consistency both chewy and crispy so good. UPDATE: Had to come back and say that I made these for Christmas cookies this year and they were the biggest hit out of everything. I just rolled them into 1\" balls and baked for smaller cookies to add to my cookie tray. FANTASTIC!",

I used milk chocolate chips instead of a bar and chopped up some whole almonds I had on hand. I made a batch with no almonds and the rest with almonds. I like them much better with the nuts it balances out the chocolate flavors. I think it would be safe to cut back on some of the chocolate in the future a little bit of each. I will make these again if I ever am in need of a super chocolate fix!",
