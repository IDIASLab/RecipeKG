It must be an acquired taste - almost everyone's first reaction was \"these are okay \" and then they'd finish the cookie and say \"they're growing on me.\" Half the people continued to pick them up and after three or four cookies I was hearing \"you know these are pretty addictive - I think I really like them because they're just so different!\" The flavor definitely evolves from the first moment you put them in your mouth to the aftertaste. I really liked the aftertaste but I didn't like the initial taste. If I make these again I think I'll decrease the sugar by about 2 tablespoons and see how that goes.",
