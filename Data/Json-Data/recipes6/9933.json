The flavor was fantastic, and the leftovers were even better the next day.  I found pork chunks, marked way down at the grocery store and didn't want to pass up the deal, but wasn't sure what to do with it. So glad I found this recipe, sure will make it again!!",

I had to adjust the recipe because I didn't have the amount of meat it called for. The meat and vegetables were very tender but the only disappointment was that I felt there wasn't enough broth. Also, after adjusting the recipe, it said it would serve 6 or 7 (I don't remember what I adjusted it to). There's no way unless you're serving other items with it. It turned out to be about 4 servings. I will definitely make this recipe again but I will add a little more of the liquid items to make more broth.",
