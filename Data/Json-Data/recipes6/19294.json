I double dipped them in the flour mixture (flour milk flour) and allowed them to rest for about 30 minutes before cooking them. I cooked them in an iron skillet with only 1 TB of olive oil but I did spray the pan liberally with Pam first so it would not soak up all of the oil. They cooked for about 6 minutes on each side for a 1/2 inch thick chop. Wonderful!",
