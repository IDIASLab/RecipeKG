I used a regular 9\" and had a lot left over and my pie spilled over as I transferred it into the oven making a big mess as it spilled onto the cookie sheet and later burned filling my kitchen with smoke and setting off the smoke alarms!! I did substitute the white sugar with light brown and the light corn syrup with molasses as one of the other reviewers suggested. I added 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and ground cloves. The pie was delicious. The pumpkin filling is indeed very thin and I wondered if it would thicken. It did beautifully. My baking time was exactly as the recipe called for. Don't forget to turn your oven down to 325 after 10 minutes and cover the edges of the crust with foil. I forgot this step and my edges burned. I learned a lot from baking my first homemade pumpkin pie in many years. I have enough fresh pumpkin frozen for 10 more pies. I'm sure the next one will be much improved.",

The only thing I changed was using brown sugar instead of white.  The taste and texture of this pie almost made me swoon and I can't stop picking at it.  Shoot, it hardly needs whip cream it is so good. \n\nI would like to offer a word of baking advice: it's a CUSTARD and as such the best test for doneness is, after an hour in the oven, I jiggle it. Just like I would a cheesecake or creme brulee.  It should be set around the outside and have a little jiggle in the middle.  If you bake it until it doesn't move, the pumpkin pie tastes dry and gets those really ugly cracks in the top.  It should be smooth, creamy and silky.",

It took 70 minutes and I had to treat it like a cheesecake by turning off the oven and leaving it in for another 20 min.  Due to the extra time, foil is needed for the crust, which is not needed in most pie recipes nor is it mentioned in this recipe.  Using a deep 9-inch pie shell, I wasted a lot of pie filling after filling it.  Again, this is a delicious recipe, it just needs to be revamped.  The next time I use this and double it, I'll use three regular-size pie shells to avoid wasting such wonderful filling.",
