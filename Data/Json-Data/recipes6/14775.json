I'm a lousy baker(who tries hard)who tends to get dry cakes even with so-called 'foolproof' boxed mixes; I'm not sure why this worked so well, but it's certainly simple, and it was so delicious one of the layers didn't last long enough to be iced--it was devoured by us right out of the oven. I used 2 9\" round pans, and that was a perfect fit, too.  We have a 55 year old, tempramental, uneven stove and it took 25 minutes; if I'd used a box or another recipe I'm sure the layers would have been fried-but these were light and fluffy.

I also added a dash of salt and baking powder to the flour. The resulting cake was wonderful with or without frosting. A good basic recipe. I'm by no means an experienced baker but I was very pleased with the results. I'm keeping this one! One note of caution - the cake comes out on the heavy side. It is not light and fluffy like the boxed mixes. If you appreciate a thicker more pound-cake like texture then you will love it.",

I made this as cupcakes, baking about 20 minutes, and frosted them with White Cake Frosting II, also from this site. This will, for sure, be one to go back to.",

Since my cakes are always coarse and grainy I figured even I couldn't ruin this recipe. Initally it was dry and coarse. My 2nd try produced a slightly better texture. On the 3rd try I switched to the \"One bowl quick method.\" I put all my dry ingredients in the bowl first then added the butter and a little liquid;throughly mixed the batter. Then added the eggs flavoring and remaining liquid. That did the trick. I acheived the texture that I wanted moist and velvety. As for the flavor my family raved over it even on the 1st two tries when it was coarse and dry. I thought the flavor was just okay. It is a good basic cake recipe and I will use it again though I agree with Susan it is not the perfect cake recipe. I will continue my search. Thank you for sharing this recipe it is a keeper.",
