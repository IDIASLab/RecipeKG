For the sake of presentation I kept the pork tenderlion whole (instead of cubing it as the recipe suggests). I cooked it in the oven for between 1-2 hours (you need to monitor it since ovens differ). I also couldn't find any butternut squash so I omitted that completely. Finally since I didn't want to go out and buy cloves and mace just for this recipe I used Allspice instead. It was fantastic! I'll definately be making this one again!",
