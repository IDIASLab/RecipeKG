I used soy protein powder instead of soy flour which I'm sure altered the result (although that made them even higher protein so I guess that's good). I also added a dollop of crushed pineapple (with juice) to increase moisture. I baked them for about 6 minutes and they stayed nice and soft -- in fact I think they tasted even better the next morning after sitting in the fridge overnight. I think a dash of vanilla extract might be a nice addition next time. In any case these were a compact and very satisfying on-the-go breakfast perfect with a cup of coffee. Thanks for sharing!",

I also had to cook them longer than 5 mins (8-10)but I think it was b/c of the fresh pumpkin being so moist.  Very good though!  I've already had 3 tonight!! Oh! Also put in walnuts. ***True test of goodness: Husband approved! He is a big health nut and doesn't like/eat anything with too much sugar in it.  He LOVED them! Merci!",
