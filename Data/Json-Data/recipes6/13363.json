That is a trick my Grandmother taught me whenever you want to reduce the \"juice\" in a fruit pie. Also I stopped using flour in fruit pies ages ago...I only use cornstarch and get a better taste. Also I have found that a 1/4 tsp. of almond extract brings out the flavor of many fruits...give it a try. Over all I liked it!",

I doubled the flour and found it was still runny at the required cooking time. My crust was pale and no bubbling in the pie. I cooked it 15 minutes longer (55 minutes) realizing the temperature has to be hot enough and LONG enough to make the 'thickener' work properly. At the end of 55 minutes my crust was golden and the pie was bubbling all over. I removed it and let it cool about two hours. It was thickened to perfection. Another thing that might have helped was adding the tomatoes to the flour/sugar mixture in a large bowl and stirring to coat the tomatoes. My husband and I were happy with the flavor even though there were a few strings coming off 'my' tomatoes in my pie.",

In that mindset I tried this pie and I have to say it's good. A little odd but good. One wouldn't think it's apple but it's quite nice. I used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and I had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown. I would also decrease the spices next time-- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much. But it's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes! I'll be making this again next year.",
