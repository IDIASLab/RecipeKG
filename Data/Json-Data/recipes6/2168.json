Recipe says 24 servings, but using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop, I ended up with 62 cookies (maybe she was thinking 3/serving?).  But that\u2019s OK because they\u2019re really good!  There are only two people in this house, so I\u2019ll be moving some to the freezer to be enjoyed later.  Followed this recipe to the letter, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  It does have a lot of ingredients, but it\u2019s worth the effort to pull them out of the pantry and then put them away.  In between batches, I put the cookie dough in the refrigerator, and they ended up shaped much better with chilled dough.  I know I\u2019ll refrigerate the cookie dough for 15 minutes before even starting to place them on the baking sheet in the future.  The recipe submitter describes them correctly, because they are more cake like, and they\u2019re soft rather than crispy.  And that works for me!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
