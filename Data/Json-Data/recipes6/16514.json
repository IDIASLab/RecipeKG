I was thrown by the instructions to put an 8-inch pie pan on top of the pan with the crust pressed into it. I didn't know whether to set it on top upside down like a pot lid or to flip it over and nestle it into the crust. After consulting with my mother in law we decided the point was to keep it flat while precooking it and so we nestled it into the crust. It turned out fine!",
