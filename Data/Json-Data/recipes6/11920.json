The filling is classic ingredients with standard amounts and ratios of ingredients. The crust is rich, light and flavorful, and the nuts, which I chopped finely, gave these another dimension of flavor.  I doubled the filling mixture and was happy I did.  I used the lemon juice called for and it was perfect, especially since I swirled blueberry preserves through the filling before I baked it.  This is creamy and delicious, and my addition of swirling the preserves throughout gave this a little flavor boost. I can't wait to make flavor variations with this!",

Also, as every cheesecake-baker knows, the cream cheese will blend better if softened.  Don't melt it, as one reviewer suggested.  This is pretty easy and good, but I don't really love the lemon flavor and would probably leave it out if I made it again.  My family didn't agree with me however, my mom in particular loved the lemon. So it's all a matter of personal preference!  Just note that it IS a noticeable flavor, so if lemon's not your favorite, definitely omit it.",

                "reviewBody": "Here are a couple tips for cheesecake beginners: 1) Make sure that all the ingredients are at room temperature before mixing. 2) Cream the cream cheese first, then add in sugar. Mix just until smooth (NOT fluffy!). 3) Hand-mixing is more preferable than using an electric mixer, because this way you can avoid incorporating too much air into the batter, which results in bubbles and cracks in the final product. However, if you insist on using an electric mixer or a stand mixer, keep the speed on low (with the exception of medium-low for creaming the cheese) and scrape the bowl frequently. 4) Well grease the pan before baking in order to prevent cracking. 5) When pouring the batter onto the crust, pass it through a sieve and use a rubber spatula to break down any lumps. 6) If you want to double the filling as some other reviewers have suggested, bake at 300 degree F for 35 - 40 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set 2 inches from edge but the center still looks a bit wet. Do NOT open the oven door while baking. Take the cheesecake out of the oven immediately after it is done (do NOT leave it in the oven like you will do with a regular cheesecake) and cool on a wire rack. It tastes best after being refrigerated for one day. I hope these tips are helpful for you!",

One thing I did that I won't do next time is I pressed the crumb mixture down in the pan pretty hard, making it harder to remove the bars when they were done. Once I got them out, though, they were fantastic!  Another thing I'll do is cook them just a tad longer, maybe 5 minutes.  They were a little soft unless I kept them refrigerated until right before serving.  Not much of a problem, though, since they disappeared so quickly!! This one is a keeper for sure!",

I wasn't overly fond of the pastry bottom or the filling itself as it was not as rich and decadent as a good cheesecake is. I did double the filling- and thank god I did because it still didn't seem like enough- I can't imagine how thin these bars would have been as written. My advice- don't make them without doubling the filling! Were they easy- yes! And that was their saving grace. I needed a dessert in a hurry and they did come out of the pan beautifully. I served them drizzled with a Mango sauce which helped dress them up. A good recipe in a pinch but not as satisfying as a real cheesecake.",
