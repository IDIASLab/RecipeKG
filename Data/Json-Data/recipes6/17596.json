I used an extra 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and substituted melted butter for the vegetable oil to give it a buttery flavor.  To compensate for the moistness I knew would be lost by using butter, I also added 2 T. of vegetable oil.  I used a full pint of blueberries. Most of that tell-tale cake mix was gone, the butter added rich flavor, the addition of 2 T. of oil contributed the moistness I was after, and the cake was just bursting with plump, fresh blueberries.  I used a specialty, swirled Bundt pan and the cake was just beautiful as well as delicious. I drizzled the cake with a shiny, white glaze of 2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 T.corn syrup and 2 T. hot water. A commercial bakery couldn't have turned out a finer cake!",
