I read the Cook's Notes but I don't think you can tell what the consistency is going to be until you bake them. I packed them firmly into the dish and actually baked them an additional 5 minutes. Followed the recipe except for using white chocolate chips (what I had on hand) and roughly chopping the pecans. Good but the fact that I can't just pick one up and eat without crumbs all over the place is a disappointment.",
