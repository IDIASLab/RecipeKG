I think maybe the cookies were dry and crumbly for one reviewer because there are a couple of ingredients missing. Along with the butter sugar extract and flour try adding 2 egg yolks. I would also omit the 1/2 tsp salt. Chill dough about an hour. After shaping dough into balls roll them in egg whites before rolling them in sesame seed. I think this recipe has potentials and would yield great cookies with some adjustments.",

However while mixing I found that the dough appeared to be very dry and crumbly which made me a little nervous. I had tripled the recipe so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it but to be on the safe side I added in two eggs which added enough moisture to work with the dough. Two tablespoons of sesame seeds wasn't nearly enough for even a single batch so I increased that by quite a bit. The end result was a beautiful little festive looking cookie that just melted in your mouth. Delicious and thank you!",
