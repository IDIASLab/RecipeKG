The sugar and butter mixture bubbles up and oozes out of these as they bake and rise in the oven; so much so that it oozed all over the oven bottom and caused an oven fire in my home. These would be fantastic, but the instructions should be in bold face: YOU MUST PLACE A LARGE COOKIE SHEET UNDER THE MUFFIN PAN TO CATCH THE DRIPPINGS. \n\nPlease, anyone trying this recipe, note this and do this to avoid any fires in your kitchen.",

I can mix them up in the KitchenAid and let them knead while I clean up the   kitchen Saturday night.  Roll them up, put them in the muffin tin (I spray the tin well with cooking spray) cover with plastic wrap (also use cooking spray on plastic) put them in the refrigerator overnight and they are ready to go.  I just let them set out on the counter for 30 minutes before putting them in the oven and this recipe has never failed me.  I usually substitute the brown sugar in the filling with white sugar and add whatever spices and zests I feel like.  These are so good there are never any left!!  Thanks for a great recipe!",
