The dough was easy to make and mix and the measurements given are exactly right. I measured the dough by the teaspoon-full and then rolled the cookies into balls and dipped the tops into raw sugar. They spread beautifully into perfectly round cookies. Fresh out of the oven they are soft and fabulous -- very buttery. Once they have cooled completely they get crispy, though the flavor is still very good. The recipe made about 48 cookies. This is a definite keeper.",

They remind me of Pecan Sandies only better. I have made them with both walnuts and pecans. I made them with pecans last because that is what I had on hand. You could also call them 'Butter Pecan Cookies' this way; it sounds a little more appetizing than Vinegar Cookies. I love how this recipe requires only a few ingredients most of which you will already have. The only cons that I can think of is that the dough can be a little crumbly and dry so I had to work the dough into flattened balls by hand before putting them on the cookie sheet(but it's worth it). They also seem to cook faster the closer you get to the bottom of the bowl so I would look in the oven at about 15 minutes. They are also a delicate crispy cookie so you need to store carefully if you are going to gift these. These are definitely gift-worthy cookies!",
