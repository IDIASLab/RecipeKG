I've used this recipe for years (without the chocolate chips - it's the Betty Crocker one) and they are fantastic!  There are two important steps to getting these to turn out right - first, you have to chill them thoroughly - either the four hours in the fridge or one or two in the freezer - or they'll turn out flat.  Baking time is super important and took years for me to get down!  They should be still squishy but not glossy - they'll firm up to be chewy on the inside with a crispy shell.",
