They weren't over powering anything just tasty. I did not have any ginger but other than that followed the recipe to the \"T\" (using reduced sodium soy). These probably will grace our plates again at the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe karebare! (Photo will be added once I'm able to upload to AR...)",
