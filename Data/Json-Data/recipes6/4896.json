After looking at many recipes on line and in cook books, I decided to try this one. There was only one ingredient I didn't already have in my cupboard and it looked in line with other recipes I saw. My husband and I loved it. We ate it solo just as a snack (it really tastes that yummy), we made pan fried coconut seitan balls, taco filling, and used the left over bits and broth for a soup...so it is also versatile and able to take on flavors of many types of cuisine. My only complaint is that I should have doubled the recipe!",

No offense to your recipe; obviously you and plenty of other folks have found success with this; I guess I just failed. I've tried 4 seitan recipes in the past 3 months, and I'm at my wit's end; all 6 test batches have turned out horribly. And, not to toot my own horn, but I will: I'm a really good cook. But obviously I really really suck at seitan lol. Can you (recipe writer) or SOMEONE out there send me the secret tip? Is there something I'm missing? Is it in the kneading? Does the water need to remain below/above a certain temperature (I've kept it at a relatively steady simmer, but sometimes it bubbles too much and other times it stalls for a few minutes with no bubbles)? I've tasted restaurant seitan and it's AMAZING. All the recipes I've tried (including this one--no offense) have been absolutely DISASTROUS.",

I followed the recipe as best as I could substituting a veggie broth powder and soy sauce. I am very happy with the results. When I would make a different recipe back in the states it would crumble into bits. This held together very well. I found the dough easy to work with and reshaped it after it was chilled to get the right log-look. Something I learned from my grandmother: the same spices you put into the broth you put into the gluten steak dough. You can play around with it as much as you like. I remember once my grandma made a mistake and fried the steaks in a chili oil and they were the most delicious! Thanks for the recipe!",

I also used Coconut Aminos and added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning. I formed it into a 8-9 inch log, wrapped tightly in aluminum foil, and steamed for an hour. This makes for a more dense seitan, which I prefer. Slices nicely for sandwiches...I can dice and use in a mock chicken salad. I can also bread it a fry it in oil for a 'fried meat' type dish.

Cooked covered for 70 minutes checking every 20 or so to make sure it didn't stick. Turned out excellent! Other attempts at cooking in a pot had \"blubbery\" results this was perfectly firm. Flavor is a little bland but that can easily be remedied next time. I was so pleased with the texture! More like \"tofurkey\" than the seitan I get a lot of times in thai restaurants. I feel like I have finally perfected the pot cooking technique (as opposed to steaming or baking). Thanks!!",
