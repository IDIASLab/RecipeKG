It was a bit too sweet for me so I would hold back a little on the sugar but it worked well with the salad as written too. The recipe makes a ton of dressing - I halved it and still ended up with quite a bit so you may want to cut it to 1/3 until you are sure you like it enough to use on more salads. Excellent fruit/nut/veggie/bacon combo! Thanks for the recipe!",

I did increase the mustard and used about 1/3 the amount of sugar called for and it was still plenty sweet. Also slivered some red onion into the salad instead of using them in the dressing. We loved the taste combination of ingredients and the color was terrific. Worked well with both grilled chicken and steak. Rounded out both meals with brown and serve sourdough bread. I think it would work to also add some feta cheese if you wanted a heartier salad. Thanks Sarah for sharing Glenda's recipe. It is terrific!",

I also cut way back on the sugar and still decided to give it 5 stars because we are just fans of less sugar in pretty much all recipes and I believe a lot of people would not think the dressing was too sweet made with the original sugar amount. I used sliced red onion in the salad instead of adding reg. onion to the dressing. Will make this again for sure.",

Also added raisins n tortilla strips for a more crunchy taste. I made recipe for 12 servings but did cut back on onions and sugar. To save me time I cut the lettuce the night before placed in covered dish made dressing in separate bowl as directed too but didn't add to lettuce until this morning. So colorful!",
