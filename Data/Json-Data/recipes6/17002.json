To make this easy recipe even easier, I just melt the butter on the stove in a big saucepan, take it off the heat, and dump in all the other ingredients, mix with a whisk, and pour it in the pan.  It takes me like 5 minutes to make these when I do it this way.  Since these brownies get a \"film\" on the top of them when they bake, it's best not to frost these.  They are so rich anyways, they don't need frosting.  Instead I just add chocolate chips, toffee pieces, nuts, or whatever else right into the batter.  I have also added instant coffee powder, rum, and butterscotch sauce.  Everytime I make them, they turn out so good and are so easy.  Thanks for the recipe!",
