I added fiber by substituting prunes for some of the berries, and substituted Stevia/coconut sugar and coconut oil for the brown sugar and canola oil.  I also added chopped nuts for some crunch.  When my grandson complained about the \"brown bits\" (chopped prunes), I blended them with the applesauce in a food processor to hide them.  We keep these on hand constantly by making a double batch and freezing the extra muffins.",

The only change I made was to use frozen mixed berries. Although the batter was  a little runny the berries did not fall to the bottom.  As a personal preference, it was a little strong on the nutmeg, while my family prefers cinnamon.  As a result, the next time I make these I will cut the nutmeg in half and add a little more cinnamon.",
