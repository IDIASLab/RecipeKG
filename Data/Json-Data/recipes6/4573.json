I found it wasn't enough broth so I used two cans of veggie broth and two cans lite coconut milk and the juice of half a lime. I added 3 teaspoons of red curry paste and a ton of ground red pepper. (i decided against the whole lemongrass etc infusion because all those flavors are already in the paste and not available in markets here!) I dried my tofu (paper towels cutting board and a big squash as weight) then cut it into small cubes. I bought a \"mushroom mix\" at publix had fresh oyster shitaki and some other kind in the package. I also added some sliced baby bells. I then shredded some cabbage added it and cooked it all only about 15 mins on around mid-high heat. I spooned it over white rice and topped with fresh bean sprouts. It was fantastic my boyfriend and his sister (both non-veggies) loved it. The whole pot went in one night! They ever asked me to make it again! It was a great dinner and all together only cost about 15 bucks!",

My husband thought it a tad bland though but poo on him it was awesome! I did work with the more ordinary ingredients I had on hand: I skipped the first step altogether because the Thai red curry paste has all of those obscure ingredients anyway. I upped the curry paste to 2 T and it might even have been better for hubby with 3. I added a few green onions used any old brown mushrooms and it was delish. Plenty of soup as it's served over the noodles anyway (I probably used more like 8 oz) and I used firm tofu drained and it wasn't slimy at all. Don't use silken if you don't like slimy. And I added it in the last 4 minutes only for fear of the sliminess. You'll love this recipe if you love Thai soups.",
