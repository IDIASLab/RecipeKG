Instead of boiling water, I microwaved the apricots in orange juice.  Second time was with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Again, I softened them in orange juice.  Last time I made them with bananas and walnuts.  Each time I had to bake them for 20 minutes, not 15, but that may have been because of the added ingredients.  This is a great recipe as a muffin base and you can add anything you want!!",

I was a little worried because I don't like cakey muffins, I like them much more dense. Well, I added some dried cranberries in place of half of the apricots, and also added about 1/2 cup of walnuts. THEY TURNED OUT SO DELICIOUS! Perfect consistancy. I should note that I totally forgot to add the 1 egg, but I wonder if thats why they were the dense consistancy I liked. Still good minus the egg and less fat! I'll continue to do sans egg.",

The combination of butter vegetable oil and buttermilk drew me in as I knew I could expect those buttery rich moist results. I felt no need to add any spice and I'm glad I couldn't be tempted by other reviews to do so. I wanted an apricot muffin not a spice muffin and that's exactly what I got with these. The ingredients directions and cooking time were all spot on. I did have a little extra batter leftover but muffin tins do vary in size. I meant to top these with demerara sugar (turbinado sugar sugar in the raw) before baking but forgot. Once they came out of the oven and I tasted them however I found it didn't matter a bit. Hubs will be taking these to a breakfast meeting tomorrow and I have no qualms about that at all with these. Nice recipe.",

I was a bit sceptical about this recipe inspite of the good reviews since I'm not a big fan of apricots. But these turned out wonderfully soft and moist and extremly tasty. Of course I did a little bit of tweaking. I added a handful of raisins to soak along with the apricots. I also added a handful of shredded coconut and about 1/2 cup of orange juice. I made about 6 muffins (17 minutes) and baked the rest in a loaf pan (35 minutes). My husband loved it. And to my surprise so did I! I guess I'll be making it again:)",
