Also, this definitely needs to chill for several hours and overnight is even better.",

I also added 1 chopped green onion and it was fantastic! My husband was very impressed.  I served it over a bagged meditarranean salad mix from the grocery store. Excellent!",

The number of choices is mind-boggling, so at some point one finally has to say STOP looking, this is the one.  I stopped with this one and whether or not I could have found one better I neither know nor care.  I was completely happy with this recipe which I prepared with no changes, using Gorgonzola, an Italian blue cheese.  I tasted this right after making it and loved it already.  I can\u2019t imagine how much better it will be by suppertime, when the flavors have melded and it tops a green salad with bacon and tomato!
