I had to use vanilla Greek style yogurt instead of plain as that was all I had on hand and I added only chopped walnuts because I didnt have any raisins. Otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved them.  Made a second batch today and decided to go a little healthier by using half whole wheat & half white flour and threw in about 2 TBSP ground flax seed. Also replaced the oil (previously used Canola) with 1/2 cup applesauce and added 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp cinnamon. I let the bran soak in this mixture a little longer to make sure it was thoroughly wet before adding the dry ingredients. These were even better than the first batch. Still came out moist and delicious and no one noticed the healthy changes. (Love it when that happens:). Will definitely be making these again. Thanks so much for sharing.",

I used both raisins and pecans. For the flour I use Chef Brads Wonder Flour mix which is equal parts of spelt brown rice and pearl barley. I also add a part of soft white wheat as well. These are mixed and ground together into a fine flour. I love this stuff works as well or better than regular flour and is whole grain and so much more nutritious.",

I have been making other bran muffins lately and 400 deg seemed a little high for 17 minutes but I went with it anyway. I think that is why they are dry that is too long or too high. Most other muffin recipies bake 375 deg for about 17 minutes. My fault I should have watched them more closely while baking.",
