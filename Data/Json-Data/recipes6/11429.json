So that's good if you have lots of figs and not much time.\r\nWe ended up splitting the layers, toasting them in the toaster oven, and adding butter, to eat the cake like a slab of a scone.  Amazingly good with your morning coffee.\r\nNext time I will make a lighter batter, probably substituting oil for the butter, and I will puree the figs (and double the amount to 2 cups in the batter!) with a little of the evapourated milk before blending the figs with the batter.  That would change this recipe from something of a coffee cake or scone-like creation to more of an after dinner cake, which is more what I'm looking for.  Again, it's a good recipe, wonderfully sweet and satisfying!",

                "reviewBody": "This cake turned out to be a pleasant surprise! I used 1 lb. of fresh figs which equaled 3 cups needed for this recipe. The figs are in season towards the end of summer and are around $5.99 a pound. The deepest darkest purple figs are the ripest and juiciest. I chopped the figs up, with skin on, and combined them into the batter as well as the filling mixture. I used buttermilk in place of evaporated. The change I made was to bake this in a bundt pan. I placed a thin layer of batter in the greased bundt pan, added the cooled filling, then topped that with the rest of the batter. I baked this at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.  I enjoyed the sweet smell of the figs baking up in the oven. The cake cooked thoroughly and I placed it aside for 35 minutes until it was luke warm/cool to the touch. The cake is a nice light golden color with brown edges. It is a moist, tender and flavorful cake with the right amount of everything! It is somewhat dense and I had a mouthful of sweet figs in every bite. The edges have a slight tender crisp to it and I can see the layer of fig filling in the cake when sliced. This tastes like Nabisco Fig Newton Bars, only BETTER and TASTIER - and in a cake! We ate more than half of the cake up while it was still luke warm. It is not often I come across a \"fig cake,\" and I am glad that I did because this turned out to be a real treat for all of us.",

                "reviewBody": "Although this cake did not come out quite right when I made it, it still tasted delicious.  I suspect most of my problem was taking the advice of other reviewers.  As I wanted more of a dessert cake than a coffee cake, I took the advice of the two reviewers who suggested increasing from 1 to 2 cups of chopped figs in the batter and pureeing those figs with the evaporated milk before adding to the batter.  Unfortunately, this made the batter so dense, the layers hardly rose.  Plus, I burned the outer edges and bottom while trying to get the middle to cook.  Every time I stuck a toothpick in the middle, it came out with crumbs so I kept baking until I realized I'd ruin the cake if I kept going.  I had to cut off the sides and bottoms to get rid of the burnt areas while the middle was still mildly soft.  I don't think pureeing the figs is such a bad idea, but I'd leave it at 1 cup in the batter, not 2.\n\nI still made the filling/topping, layered the cake with it, and just cut the cake into bars so as not to waste it.  Despite all my troubles, the bars were still delicious.  I'd definitely make this cake again, but will stick closer to the original recipe and ignore the reviewers!",

I think the variable juiciness of fresh figs may give different results each time, so you have to be flexible when making it.  I leave out the water in the fig topping and use a little more lemon juice, sometimes some zest. Wonderful recipe!",
