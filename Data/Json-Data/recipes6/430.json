I tried to rescue it by adding 2 chopped apples and more brown sugar and butter and still wasn't happy after baking about 15 more minutes. I put it in a container overnight and put it in the fridge. I had a flash of inspiration to make it into a quick bread. I found the recipe Summer Squash Bread on AR and used that as my starting point. I made the bread per the directions adding half a cup Greek yogurt cut the oil to a quarter cup anning a half cup applesauce and a cup of chopped pecans. It made a large loaf and a smaller loaf and the texture was like coconut had been added from the spaghetti squash. Wow it was a big hit at my house and it made me feel so much better because I was able to salvage the squash and apples and my time and come up with something delicious.",
