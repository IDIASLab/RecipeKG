Mine took quite a bit longer than etimated, and used more liquid, but I made it in a deep skillet rather than a saucepan, which may have affected the speed of evaporation/absorbtion...I don't know. Anyway, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I followed it exactly (which includes the 'as needed' and 'until' parts of the recipe) and it worked like a charm. Risotto is not at all hard to make, but it is certainly boring and time consuming - so it probably won't happen often at my house, but was definitely worth trying. Thanks for the recipe!",
