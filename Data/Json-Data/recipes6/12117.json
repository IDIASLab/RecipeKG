I'd say I did them for about 8 minutes or so and they were browned on the bottom and light on top. They are pretty crisp and have a distinctive spiced flavor which I was surprised my six-year-old actually liked. These are pretty good definitely different though I prefer a more \"standard\" sugar cookie flavor. Thanks for the recipe!",
