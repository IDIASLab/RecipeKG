He said \"those really thin pancake things you put strawberries in and stuff.\" So always enjoying the health benefits of a vegan diet I came across this egg less recipe. It was glorious. Tasted great! We couldn't wait the two hours in the refrigerator so we iced the liquid portion of the batter after mixing in the butter. (yeah the butter solidified but didn't affect the outcome at all). The challenge was to get the batter thin enough in the pan. Don't let the pan get too hot and smooth out the batter with your scooping spoon very thinly before it sets up.",

I have almost no cooking experience and found the recipe easy -- and my wife liked them better than real crepes! Make sure the pan is HOT before adding the batter and spread the batter very thin very quickly (swirling pan as per the directions). The result is really light and crispy crepes. A little powdered sugar on top makes them look great and taste even better. The only problem is that I can't make them fast enough to keep up with how quickly they're eaten!",
