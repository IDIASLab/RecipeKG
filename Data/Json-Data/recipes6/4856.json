This is the best risotto I've ever tasted, and it was improvised by my wife Amanda from scratch. I forced her to write down the recipe. And here it is, so the entire world can enjoy the sheer brilliance of great risotto in a fraction of the normal time. Don't say I never told you how awesome this stuff is.",

The covered-bowl-on-steamer-rack method in the pressure cooker didn't work at all so we ended up having to finish the rice in a saucepan. Also: three tablespoons of garlic is insane. I love saffron risotto and I love porcini risotto but somehow these two lovely flavorful ingredients cancelled each other out. And then shrimp adds a whole other competing flavor.",
