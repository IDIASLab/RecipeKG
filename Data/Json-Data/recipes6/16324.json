Maybe I should have taken them out of the pan before they cooled because they stuck to the pan and I had a horrible time getting them out. Will make this again but will do something different with the sauce maybe pouring over after 20 minutes of baking or just remove dumplings before cooling. Anyone has an idea please let me know.",
