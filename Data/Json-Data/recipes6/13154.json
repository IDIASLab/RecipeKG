I rolled the dough balls in sugar and the cookies did turn out pretty. I had no issues with them being flat or with cracking. The problem is they just don't taste that great and the texture is rather disagreeable as well. I expect a chocolate cookie to be chocolatey! These suffered in chocolate intensity. The crumb while moist is not of the chewy consistency you'd expect. While hubby and I don't always agree we did on these cookies right down to giving them only 2 stars. The bottom line is the most flavor came from the chocolate kiss! Without it these would have been pretty much tasteless baked dough balls.",

(first time i had butter stuck on my ceiling. oops:P). the came out much better. i skipped out the egg white addition at the end as they were sticky enough to hold the sugar on them. plus. i found the egg white made them stick to the pan and made the sugar not look so appealing after baking. the second batch looks exactly like the picture. yay!!:)",
