The custard makes it less traditional but it's still fantastic. I made 2 of them for a small dinner party- enough for everyone to have some and some left over which was greatly appreciated. It got rave reviews. I like others also used three apples in each one plus some apple pie spice with the apples (and more cinnamon) and I also added a little cinnamon to the glaze which added just the right extra touch in my opinion. Try this- you'll love it. Oh- and warm each slices in the microwave about 25-30 seconds. It's so much better that way!",

The custardy filling and the spiced apples combine to make something so wonderfully delicious, and the plain old pie crust could be a dessert by itself when you add that delicious sugary glaze on top. I highly, highly recommend this recipe. A couple of suggestions: 1) The recipe suggests serving the pie cold, but try it at room temperature, or slightly warm (30 seconds in the microwave should do it) 2) One more apple will add a little thickness, and 3)The thinner your apple slices, the better!

People fight over seconds. - slice the apples very thin or precook them if you like thick chunks of apple. Try it with pear and/or peach. Adding walnut pieces is a nice variation. Use aluminum foil at the end of baking to keep the crust from getting too brown. A little extra cinnamon or lemon zest in the glaze is good. (I use an extra deep dish make a lattice top and extra custard and glaze.) Make 2 and hide 1 if you want leftovers. Delicious!",

He said this pie was \"O.K. but don't make it again.\"  I agree with him.  I think it all boiled down to this...... If you are a die hard Apple Pie lover, try another recipe.

I used 3 apples and chopped and saut\u00e9ed them before spreading them on top of the cream. This pie is the best!!
