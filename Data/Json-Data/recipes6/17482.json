I didn't use pecans on top because my kids wouldn't eat them anyway. Instead of brushing the frosting on (I couldn't figure out how exactly to do that) I turned the cookies upside down and dipped the marshmallow portion into the warm frosting. Then I allowed the excess frosting to drip off before placing the cookie back on the cooling grid right side up. They're very nice looking cookies. The frosting has a nice sheen when it cools. I think I'll make some for the holidays and put some sprinkles on top while the frosting is still 'wet.' This recipe is a keeper for sure!",

I actually looked up the ingredients hoping to find these because my friend's similar recipe just said \"put a marshmallow on top.\" And I didn't know if it meant a large or small one. (I made large cookies and put a whole large marshmallow on top. My family loved it but I am not big on marshmallows.) I think a halve of the large is perfect. As for the frosting: with the trouble everyone is having try substituting the 1 cup of white sugar with 3 cups of powered sugar. (As my friend's recipe calls for. Here is the exact frosting recipe: 1 square unsweetened chocolate(or 3 tbsp. cocoa and 1 tbs. shortening or oil) 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup milk 3 cups powered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Melt chocolate. Add butter and milk. Bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Stir while boiling for 1 minute. Sift in powered sugar. Mix well. Add vanilla and stir in well. After you let cookies cool frost them.) Do not overcook. I tried 10 minutes and they were too dry. Stick to 8 minutes. Good luck!",

It was just a couple mixing bowls measuring cups and a baking pan and some beaters to clean up just like any other cookie! I say make them for sure. I used mini marshmellows (2) since I didn't have any large and topped some with chopped nuts and some without. These are chewy and chocolatey like a brownie but with something \"extra\". As for the icing brushing it on did seem like it may make it difficult so I just drizzled in on with a small spatula and they looked fabulous! You can't eat just one of these:)",
