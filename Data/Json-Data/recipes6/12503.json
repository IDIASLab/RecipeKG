This recipe makes old-fashioned, delicious, soft cookies.  One tip in making these come out great:  rather than drop them onto your baking sheet using spoons or a scoop as you would with chocolate chip cookies, roll them into 1 1/2 inch balls, then roll through a small bowl of white sugar, then place on the baking sheet.  This makes them perfect!  ",
