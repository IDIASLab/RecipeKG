Some people like just heat; but if there's no flavor then it's no different than a mouthful of fire. I didn't change anything at all since it was my first time making it. But maybe next time I will use just 10 habaneros so some of my friends will be able to eat it without bursting into flames! Thanks for a great recipe.",

The taste was wonderful but there was only a little heat. Then it hit me. Wow! This stuff is fantastic! I love it and it was a huge hit in my house.",

Melt a stick of butter with a cup or so of sauce and simmer. It tones down the heat a little which is not said as a good or bad thing because obviously people who make this sauce LOVE hot food it's just simply a fact. It just happens to be that it is an amazing combination warmed with butter and is fantastic on crispy wings or as a dipping sauce for tenders or grilled chicken (or pork). Trust me try it. Use as much butter or sauce to your liking-you can't go wrong. Also this stuff is amazing straight up on mac and cheese! Wow! We are addicted to that combo. Definitely 5 stars!",

My husband likes the hot sauce in the family and I usually stay away, as most are just fire in your mouth.  I made this and it was accepted by everyone.  I did not use Habaneros, I have a garden and tons of hot peppers ( 5 or 6 kinds) and was running out of things to do with them - this was fantastic.  I really think the Mango and green onion does something for these hot peppers, we have had it on chicken, fried pork chops,  with chips, I made a curry meal and we ate it with that.   My husband took it to work for others to try, it is gone and I am ready to go and pick some more peppers.  You will not be unhappy.  Thanks for a great receipe. NOTE: I tried to make this and process it in a pressure cooker like I do other things, it did not taste the same, it was not bad when we opened the jars, but it seemed to be fermenting - tiny bubble inside, not sure why, or what was reacting with what - but it altered the taste, much better fresh  - will try freezing some next time I make a batch and see how that does. WE REALLY LIKE THIS SAUCE.",

I blended mixed and even put it through the grinder to try and \"thin-it-out.\" The concoction was still very thick. I put it in some chili to see if I mixing it with food would eliminate the smell and add some flavor. No way! The overpowering MUSTARD taste and smell was still present. Think about it a quarter cup of Dry Mustard. Perhaps if it was eliminated the recipe might be good. I didn't even use the entire quarter cup because I ran out. The mixture tastes like a Vodka Mustard Schnapps.",
