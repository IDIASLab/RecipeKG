The calories were also quite high but figured I could split the servings. Either way I tried the recipe as is but cutting the yogurt amount in half. I thought it had a pretty bright red color and actually tasted like a pb&j. I could taste the peanut butter. Then for some reason I tried it with the additional 1/4 cup of yogurt as suggested and it lost the peanut butter flavor and the red color turned to pale pink and making it a little more artificial looking. I would definitely try it with half of the amount of yogurt suggested. I liked the idea anyway.",

My husband was a fan because he loves peanut butter. I thought it was just ok. I prefer a fruitier tasting smoothie. This is a very thick smoothie due to the yogurt so if you like it thinner you will need to add some additional milk or maybe some juice. I did use splenda instead of brown sugar but other than that made exactly as the recipe stated.",
