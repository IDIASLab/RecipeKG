I'm going to taste test again when the cream cheese mixture has sat for a bit and see how they are then. I would use more pesto the next time no bacon drippings and I think they would be fine without the added turkey in there also as a quick appetizer. Would be very easy to change this up with adding almost any seasonings. Nice recipe thanks Windy! The flavor does develop more after sitting. The guys went crazy over these and I couldn't stop eating them.",
