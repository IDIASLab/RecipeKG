The only two things I did differently were increasing the cocoa to almost 1 cup; and using 1/4 c. mix per serving (which is what the canister from the grocery says to use). Previously I have made this with confectioners' sugar instead of regular white and it tasted bad. It needed salt and vanilla when served. But made this way with only dry milk white granular sugar and cocoa it needed nothing! Little sis was happy that it didn't leave residue in the bottom of the cup too. We added whipped cream on top when we drank it but it didn't need that. I might give this as gifts this Christmas!",
