I made the mistake of using dry instant pudding mix and once I placed it in the bowl, I realized that the only moisture was from the eggs!  So, I had to go and rebuy all of the ingredients again!  \r\n\r\nBut, the other reviews were right when they said that this was easy to make!  I suggest using a mixer (the recipe just said to \"combine\").  It filled my house with a wonderful fragrance and looks  and tastes delicious!!!",

Anyways I thought I'd point out for others who don't know the sugar and the chips won't completely melt they will carmalize so don't think you've done something wrong. Also if you pour all this into a 13 x 9 cake pan it will take about 30 - 35 min. in a 350 degree oven. Everyone who tried this cake loved it. Someone suggested using chocolate cake mix chocolate pudding and chocolate chips. Now there's death by chocolate! Enjoy!",

It was SO moist and good. And no one will realize you cheated and used cake mix either it tastes that decadent.: ) Great recipe thank you so much!!
