I did change the egg amount--it was asking for an egg and a half what I did was omit the half and up the applesauce to an additional quarter cup. Everything else I kept exactly the same. I did make muffins out of this recipe. I got 12 biggish muffins out of this not ten. They baked up nicely and are very moist and on point for sweetness. For my husband and I I don't know that we liked the cocoa powder in this recipe (the kids inhaled it between the both of them they ate FIVE muffins) but really that's not a deal breaker. I think it would be just as good without just add an additional 2 tablespoons of flour and omit the cocoa powder next time. But that's really a personal preferance not reflective of the recipe. The zucchini bread with the cinnamon chips is a winning combination. VERY good. NOTE: I used Hershey's cinnamon baking chips in this recipe.",

The zucchini whole wheat flour and applesauce make it a healthier alternative. The first time I made it I was not able to find cinnamon baking chips so I used chocolate chips. I finally found the cinnamon chips at another store. It was great both ways. This got rave reviews from my family! Thanks for sharing the recipe Angelina!",
