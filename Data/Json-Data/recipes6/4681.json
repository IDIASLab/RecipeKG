I also would not saute the vegetables prior to making the roux. I always make my roux first then saute the garlic onions pepper and celery and finally the broth whatever other veggies you care to add spices and gradually bring up the cayenne to your desired level. Finally if you use that much okra you really don't need file powder. They both serve the same purpose thickening the gumbo. All minor comments about a very nice recipe.",

I don't love okra that much anyway - a little less cayenne as others said and that worked for me. Used about half - wasn't enough salt for me so i added another teaspoon or so Two issues were: - there was no way i could (or would) continuously whisk the roux for 15 minutes. It would have cooked down to nothing. I did about five minutes and it was perfect already - too much broth called for in this recipe for me. I like my soups and stews a bit heartier/thicker so i used five cups and there was still a lot of broth.",
