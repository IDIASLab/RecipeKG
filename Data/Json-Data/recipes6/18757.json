Make sure to grease the mold well and don't forget the lid. I didn't grease my lid and when the pudding puffed up it stuck. Then again I doubled the recipe because it didn't look like it would make enough to fill my mold. I didn't expect it to puff as much as it did. I guess it's all that baking soda.:) Once again WONDERFUL. This will be a part of my holiday table from now on!",

I have imagined a bite of the pudding in \"Scrooge\" that sounds so delectable to the anticipation of the \"Cratchit family\" in story. I followed this recipe precisely...even down to the whole cranberries and am I ever glad I did. Perfect but you must have the warm sauce to pour over. This may appeal to perhaps a more grown-up palate but maybe not though. Warning this is very rich and I can see why people make it for the holidays (only) as a special treat.",

I thought she was doing magic I cut back on the baking soda (1 &1/2 TBS) and I used a Nordic Ware pull apart pan (snowflake design) and my turkey roasting pan as the steamer. Both covered with foil. It was DONE in 1 hour (I probably could have pulled it at 45 mins.) I have to admit that I depended on the Teflon coating more than I should have next time unsalted butter thick coating. It's Okay for us but... I'm also thinking a silicon form would work well for the release... Mom's coming over and I can't wait to surprise her! Merry Christmas memories.",
