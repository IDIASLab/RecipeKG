Subtle hints of chocolate and coffee and, love it or hate it, it is definitely evident there is liquor in the cake. I didn't care for how thin the glaze was, though it might be nice as one of those glazes that coats and soaks into the cake.  I just added enough powdered sugar to get the glaze of drizzling consistency.  Overall, a rather average cake mix cake.",

I don't understand why the recipe doesn't call for a chocolate cake mix. I'll try that next time. The only other thing I did was use all Kahlua instead of any water (1cup Kahlua no water). I also ditched the glaze mix because that sounded like a big mess. I used the glaze recipe from the rum cake from this website. It's cooked butter and sugar. I subbed Kahlua for the rum. The glaze soaked in and made the cake verrrrrrry yummy! Again a chocolate cake would make this truly \"mocha.\"",
