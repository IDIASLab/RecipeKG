I didn't get syrupy and thick in the pan, I cooked it for about 45 mins. and the yams were done but there was no syrup - just water and seasonings.  So - I put it in a corning ware dish and popped it in the oven with all the liquid.  I let it cook at 400 degress for about 40 mins. and it turned out great!!  Everyone loved it and said they hope I make it for Thanksgiving!  I added a small amount of nutmeg, cinnamon and swirled some molasses on top while it was cooking!  It was a true success !!",

I must have used four really big yams because it looked like there was hardly any water in the saucepan so I added more and ended up with a lot of the syrupy stuff at the end but thats was alright....I just added some more cubed yams and cooked them again. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar and mixed the yams at the end with a hand mixture for a smoother consistency. Maybe I am just partial to butter and sugar...but these were terrific and easy to make. Thanks!!",
