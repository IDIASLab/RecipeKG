        "description": "A hearty, vegetarian soup perfect for warming the belly on a rainy day. My first foray into making a completely vegetarian soup, and I can say I didn't miss the meat component at all! Goes great with a crusty bread. Good for a large gathering of people or for plenty of leftovers! My original recipe yields a large pot of soup, so I always share with my parents and still have plenty left over for lunch or dinner the next day. Please note it is important to add salt with or before the beans so that the beans can absorb some of the salt, otherwise they can taste a little bland. The soup gets better with a little time and tastes awesome the next day.",

Used baby bella mushrooms (which gave it great texture and thicker broth) and also substituted a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh spinach for kale & swiss chard. I don't usually use vegetable broth so I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor but I would caution the amount of salt. Also would use a bit less rosemary -unless your really love it!! Thanks for the recipe - will be one of our favorites!!",

For a little extra depth of flavor I added 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.  Oh, and here's another little thing that I do.  After soaking the beans overnight, the \"husks\" of the large white lima beans mostly detach and float to the top.  These \"husks\" are not yummy.  I take about 2 minutes to fish them all out.",
