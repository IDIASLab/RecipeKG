Definitely not tender enough after about an hour.  Also, there is no need to warm the beans ahead of time just throw them in the pot about five minutes before the soup is done.  Make sure you rinse and drain the beans first or you will get a pastey taste.  You don't need chicken granuels if you don't have them.  Use 3 boullion cubes.  Same thing.  I actually used chicken \"stock\" (not broth) for more flavor and additional liquid.  I served this with all the toppings mentioned but added Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream and crushed lime flavored Xochitl tortilla chips.  These chips are very thin and crispy. Excellent!!",

Our grocery store did not have serannos, so I used jalapenos, and I cooked the onion with the meat- only because we don't like raw onion.  It was really yummy. We had it with a salad with avocado dressing and sliced avocados.  I liked it alone, but the rest of the family ate it with corn tortillas.  I honestly didn't think combining the beans with the meat mixture would taste so good, but it was.  I will make it again for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)",
