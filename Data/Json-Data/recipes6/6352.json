                "reviewBody": "This was excellent. I made a few tweaks that I think contributed to the success. In addition to the onion and celery I sauteed two hatch chiles (could use anaheim peppers) to give a little heat / flavor. I used 2% milk instead of half-and-half -- there is enough fat content already and the flour creates all the thickness necessary. I then used 3 cups of chicken stock instead of the 1/3 diluted ratio suggested which reduces the amount of salt needed but adds a lot of flavor. I used two large roast chicken breasts for the chicken. For the hot sauce Frank's is a must for authenticity though it is not particularly hot so 1/2 cup was about right for me. I would also advise that you wait until the soup is essentially 100% done before adding hte cheese and then add it in small batches so that it melts in evenly. All in all an excellent soup and one I will make again.",

Also top the soup with a little crumbled blue cheese for even more authenticity. Other than that the recipe is perfect in it's ratios. Yum!",
