It's often called \"poor man's lobster\" because its firm flesh and delicate, slightly sweet flavor are similar to lobster. Served with a balsamic, garlic, and sun-dried tomato topping, this recipe comes together in a snap.",

The only changes I made were to cut the monkfish into medallions because they saute more evenly and quickly (and get better sauce coverage!) and I also reduced the oil to a bare minimum, at least by a third, maybe even half, and it still tastes rich.  Highly recommend!",
