I have never made meringue before, and I thought, \"How could 2 egg whites possible make 48???\"  So I doubled the recipe.  I never did get \"stiff peaks\" so I dumped and started over, this time following the recipe...mostly.  I didn't have candycanes, so I used peppermint extract and green food coloring.  I followed one other poster's advice and used a ziploc baggie with a corner cut out to pipe out perfect little hershey's kiss sized meringues.  I got at least 48!  I found that after cooking for the 1.5 hrs, I only had to let them sit in there for about an hour more, and they were perfectly done.  Very easy, no fat, probably could be done with splenda to be low cal as well.",

                "reviewBody": "As a long time meringue maker and daughter of professional bakers, let me share a few tips.  First of all, check your oven temperature.  Put a thermometer in your oven and see if it's running hotter than your set temp.  Never put meringues on foil, always use parchment paper.  They slide right off.  Never, ever let any egg yolk get into your egg whites.  They will not stiffen properly if even the smallest amount of egg yolk gets into your egg whites.  Make sure you add the sugar slowly, beating well in between each addition.  Don't try to beat egg whites by hand, always use a mixer.  You need that extra speed and the air that gets into your whites with a mixer.  Using a whisk will not achieve that result and a mixer is so much easier and quicker, too.  Bring your eggs to room temp before trying to beat them.  It just works better.  Adjust the baking time based on the size of your meringues.  Never take the meringues out until they're completely cool.  Once they're cool, humidity shouldn't affect them at all.  Meringues are so versatile and you can play with the flavors which makes them so much fun to make.  They're really one of the easiest cookies you can make but you do have to be careful and you do have to follow the directions or they will be a flop.",

By adding a little food coloring you can make these year-round (green for St. Patrick's Day red for Valentine's Day etc.) Instead of lining the cookie sheets with foil I used parchment paper with great results. A regular meringue cookie maker told me to never make meringues on a humid or rainy day because they will flop. You may want to keep this in mind when making them. I'll be making these again. They were impressive yet so simple (and inexpensive) to make!!! Great for low-fat dieters also!!",

THE MORE SUGAR THAT YOU ADD THE CRISPIER THEY BECOME. ALSO YOU CAN SPINKLE THESE WITH COLORED SUGAR CINNAMON AND SUGAR OR EVEN FLAVORED JELLO (ALSO YOU CAN PUT JELLO IN THEM FOR FRUIT FLAVORED MERINGUES) FOR FUN COLORS AND TASTE ADD MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS KIDS LOVE THEM. ALLOW TO BAKE FOR THE FULL 90 MINUTES AND THEM SHUT THE OVEN OFF AND LEAVE IN OVEN FOR ANOTHER HOUR. IF COOKING MORE THAN ONE TRAY ADD ABOUT 10 MINUTES COOKING TIME FOR EACH TRAY AND ROTATE TRAYS 1/2 WAY THROUGH COOKING. THIS HELPS FOR ALL THE MOISTURE TO BE EVAPORATED. MERINGUES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CRISP ALL THE WAY THROUGH NOT CHEWY IN THE CENTER. CAN PIPE THESE THROUGH A PASTRY PAG WITH LARGE DECORATIVE TIP TO MAKE FANCY MERINGUES.
