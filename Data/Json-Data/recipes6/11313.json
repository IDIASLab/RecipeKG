Very easy to make.\n\n\nI wish we had the ability to reply to reviews on this site, since we can not I'll make a few comments to some of the reviewers here.\n\n\nSpread the cake in the pan all the way to the corners with a spatula.  Smooth it evenly throughout the pan.  If you dump it all in the center of the pan, it will not spread out to the corners in the oven by itself.\n\n\nSpray the pan with regular Pam, line it with wax paper, spray the wax paper with Pam for baking (with flour) and the cake will be easy to remove from the pan. \n\n\nRoll the cake in a towel (or as another suggested, use a pillow case).  This is done to let the heat and moisture escape. Rolling it in wax paper will trap in moisture from the hot cake and make the cake soggy.  \n\nHope this helps.",

We put our wax paper on the table, lightly coated it with powdered sugar then when it came out of the oven we put a small amount of powdered sugar on top of the cake and then rolled it up and put in ref. to cool down. It unrolled real good. We also added 8 Tablespoons of Cool Whip to the filling and it really gave it a good taste. We have more orders to fill for Christmas.lol. So you can see it is a very good recipe.",

I varied the way I prepared the pan each time based on reviews here.  Here's what I found...the first time I made it I just sprayed the pan then poured in the batter.  It came out fine.  The second time I did the same - and it stuck!  Same pan but for some reason I was not as lucky as the first time.  The third time I lined the pan with parchment, sprayed that then poured in the batter.  That seemed to work best but I found out why you spray the pan also *before* you put the paper in...some batter leaked under the paper and stuck to the pan a bit. It stil turned out okay.  I think I have learned: DON'T TAKE YOUR CHANCES ONLY SPRAYING THE PAN.  Lastly, IF YOU CRACK IT BEYOND REPAIR: I broke it into pieces and used a trifle bowl to layer the pieces and the cream cheese mixture (with 1 cup cool whip mixed into the cream cheese).  I topped it with more cool whip, nuts, and a dusting of cinnamon.  It was a good rescue and looked great!",

                "reviewBody": "My mom and I make these every year.  This is our exact recipe, but I do have a few suggestions to make this experience much better for you!  Make them five at a time.  One large can of PURE pumpkin is exactly enough for five rolls.  Cook them on parchment paper but make sure you fold it right into the cookie sheet.  When you pour the batter in, the folded paper helps to prevent the edges from burning.  Wait until they cool completely and then spread the cream cheese frosting.  Leave an inch around all four sides w/o frosting. it will spread when you roll it. Make them at least a day or two before you need them.  When you have them rolled, wrap them as tight as you can get them in saran wrap. Even if they have cracked, the saran wrap will fix everything. After wrapping them put them directly into the refrigerator.  I usually make 20 in one day near Thanksgiving and freeze them to give as small gifts over the holiday season.  Not to mention that my husband then has access to them all year long!!! ",

It's just a pain to peel off afterwards. Instead of putting it on a towel you can put some saran wrap down and sprinkle it then use that to roll it up after it cools a little. We forgot to turn it over though before we put the cream cheese mixture on the ugly side that way the nice smooth side is up. We also put cool whip in the filling but one cup was a bit much. Neufch\u00e2tel cheese also worked fine (it's healthier). We also used splenda in the cream cheese filling in place for half the sugar. Enjoy! Very tasty",

                "reviewBody": "Everyone loves this one! All that rolling sounds a little complicated, but it's really pretty easy. I want the nuts on the inside of the cake so I grease  the pan, use parchment paper and grease that also. As soon as it comes out of the oven, I run a butter knife around the edges, flip it onto a sideless (?) cookie sheet and flip it again onto the powdered sugar tea towel, roll up and chill. 3/4 of a cup of walnuts works best for me. Edit: After making this recipe many, many times now, I decided to change  pans and wondered what took me so long. I make other cake rolls and I use a 13x9 jelly roll pan. It was perfect!  It isn't a big difference, but I liked the looks much better. It was just a smidge thicker.",
