        "description": "I have watched the TV chefs use black truffle in dishes for years and have always wanted to try it. I couldn't locate whole truffles, but found truffle-infused items like salt, butter, and oil. This was more economical and still imparted that black truffle flavor. This was my first taste, and results were amazing. I am now a black truffle fanatic for life.  This recipe below is one I am extremely proud of and I hope you will take the risk and try it for yourselves. Yay for the black truffle!",
