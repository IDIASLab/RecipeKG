I used my large pressure cooker without the pressure cooker attachment thingy because it was large enough to hold my bundt pan.

I then made a sauce using Bailey's Cappacino Liquor and whipped cream. Amazing. Thank you for such a wonderful dream cake...",

I didn't have a pot large enough to put the whole bundt inside it so I rested the rim of my bundt on the rim of the largest pot I had which fit perfectly. I put foil over only the bundt at first and then toward the end of the boiling I put foil over the whole pot to get the top of the cake done. It was moist and delicious but not too rich. We also used a chocolate glaze that worked perfectly. Enjoy!",

Instead of using a rack I did it in a square Bundt pan that was inserted into a round pot so that the edges overlapped and it was held up by the rim of the pot. I filled the bottom two inches of the pot with water and covered the top with the pot lid (with the pan inside). Seemed to work great but took much longer than anticipated about two hours because some of the steam was escaping. Thanks for a great cake!",
