So when I blended the spinach mixture it came out really liquidy & less pesto-y. It's also possible the the potatoes I bought were smaller than what the author of the recipe used. Overall though the taste is great but my mashed potatoes came out more like a thick soup (we cooked out a lot of the liquid though by keeping it on the heat a little longer). But it tastes good & I'll try it again next time w/more exact measurements & maybe less veggie stock to start off with at least. I would also suggest sauteeing the garlic for a better flavor before adding it to the spinach mixture.",

First I didn't have red potatoes so I used russets cooked in the chicken broth. While the potatoes were cooking I made the spinach pesto in the food processor - garlic spinach & olive oil - pulse to get it moving then let it run. Then added the Parmesan to the food processor. When the potatoes are tender - drain but reserve the cooking liquid (broth) mash the taters with a hand held potato masher - adding a little bit of the reserved broth. Add the spinach pesto - mash - add more broth if needed. They are really delicious and low fat too. If you don't want the garlic flavor - just leave it out. Perfect for St. Patrick's Day!",

My pesto like the previous reviewer's came out too liquidy maybe because I used fresh spinach that I had on had measured out in cups yet might have messed up in the quantity conversion.
