At first, the kids didn\u2019t even notice there were lentils instead of meat. The only thing I will change next time is to omit the broth and simply use broth powder. The extra liquid made cooking time a bit long as it took a long time to reduce risking to over cook the lentils. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.",

I made this recipe as written for that guest the day before my company since I felt the flavours would meld better after being reheated. As I taste tested it there was something missing so I added about 3/4 of a tsp of salt in addition I added 2 or 3 tbsp of tomato paste as I wanted the bolognese to thicken up as I found it quite loose and watery. The bottom line was that my guest loved it. Since there were leftovers the next day I added some italian sausage chunks baby quartered potatoes and beef broth and made a lovely soup for dinner for my husband and myself.",
