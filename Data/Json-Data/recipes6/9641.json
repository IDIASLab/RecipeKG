I used Lakanto granular monkfruit sweetener instead of Splenda (personal preference, I do not like the aftertaste from Splenda). I love that this is low carb. I do think it's very vague to state 3 \"squeezes\" of lemon juice, so that was a bit of an estimate. It turned out really good though and I would make this again to use up fruit. A pinch of salt would really bring out the flavors.",
