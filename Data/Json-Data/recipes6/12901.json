Since this recipe did not specify how big the dough balls should be I shaped mine into 1-inch balls. I ended up with enough for five dozens. If you are going to roll them into 1-inch balls DEFINITELY decrease the baking time. I baked them for only 10 minutes and they turned out quite dark and very crunchy. If I use this recipe again I may try baking them for only 7 to 9 minutes. Also when I first looked at this recipe I was surprised by the amount of salt that it called for. I decreased it to 1/4 teaspoon. Later I found another recipe on this web site called \"Chewy Peanut Butter Cookie\" that had the EXACT ingredients with no salt at all. Since my family prefers a softer and chewier cookie I will probably go back to my old recipe. Yet if you like a crunchy cookie this recipe may just fit the bill.",

I followed the recipe exactly except used margarine instead of shortening and I only baked for 10 minutes exactly. They were chewy and soft and WONDERFUL. So depsite all the reviews and the posters insistence that these aren't a chewy cookie mine turned out perfect. Perhaps it was the shorter baking time. I highly recommend this cookie.",
