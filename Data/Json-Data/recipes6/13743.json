I reduce the sour cream to 3/4c as others have suggested, reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp, add black pepper, and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder with the salt & sugar. I use a large can of french fried onions and mix 1/4-1/2 can into beans, the rest I crush with the cracker topping and extra melted butter.  I add extra cheese (like most cheesy recipes I use), and mix some into the beans.    This can be mixed together ahead of time then thrown in the oven 30 minutes before serving.",

I made this for Christmas exactly as the recipe is written, as I always try to do first, and then I made this again today, as a request by my husband for his regional meeting luncheon.  The first time was really great with simple go to ingredients, but the second time with a little extra energy and personal preferences added....was to die for.  The serving dish at the luncheon was all but licked clean.  My husband even found one of his crew scraping the serving spoon to ensure all that was to be had was had!  Too funny.  The second time I made some minor changes.  I used approximately 2 lbs fresh green beans which I steamed just shy of perfect since they were going in the oven as well, I used two 8oz blocks of Cabot (absolute hands down best cheese ever) seriously sharp cheddar (whatever reviewer said there was too much cheese would not be able to survive living at my house!) mixing about 4 oz into the beans, I minced my onion so there would be no large bites in my finished casserole, I added several turns of course ground black pepper, added about 1/2-1 t of garlic powder and finally used the French's Onions at my husband's request.  The casserole was loved by all and I was finally not the one taking food home from a covered dish!  Thank you so much Amy this is my new go to favorite for holidays AND covered dishes!",

Then add sour cream and 1/2 the cheese in the saute pan. Pour this mixture over the beans in the casserole dish, add the other 1/2 cheese, then the crackers & butter.
