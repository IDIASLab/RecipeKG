I didn't have Mrs Dash or alternative so I used some garlic powder and some Herbs de Provence and made my own garlic/herb blend. Used dried dill weed too. Hamburger buns instead of French Bread and butter instead of olive oil for the toasting bread. This was great with Monteray Jack cheese and bacon bits. This had a nice mild flavor that was tasty. I am definitely making this again! Thanks so much for the yummy grilled chicken sandwich. My taste buds are dancing. YUM.",

Excellent sandwich with the ciabatta roll. I still toasted them in a pan to get the extra flavor. Definitely a sandwich to make over and over.",

I used A LOT more chicken than this recipe calls for because I am typically feeding 6-8 people. I used 9 chicken breasts the last time. Also I don't have Mrs. Dash on hand so I used this chicken rub recipe Chicken Seasoning Blend on Allrecipes in place of it and all the other spices since it had all the same stuff in it and more basically (except dill which I don't like). I cut the chicken breasts in half. I let the chicken sit for at least 30 minutes in the marinade one time I had a lot of time so I did it for 2 hours. (I think that's better but 30 minutes for a quick meal if you don't have time) I pounded down the chicken to try to make them even thickness (they cook better that way and less time). Toasted buns and serve my family was very happy to have a new menu item...",
