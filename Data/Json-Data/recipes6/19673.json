Everybody wants the recipe! I need to stress like another reviewer it's an absolute must to wear gloves to protect your skin from the Capsaicin the irritant that makes the peppers hot. It's also a good idea to ventilate your work area so not to breathe in the vapors. Especially if you use the footnote suggestion on how to take some of the hot out of the peppers before using them. The vapors are pretty wicked when you open the microwave door & also while rinseing them with warm water. I followed this recipe exactly & they were perfect each time. The footnote says you can repeat the process with the milk if you like but I found that just one time was sufficient to take any overbearing heat out but left a perfect amount of burn effect! My husband normally doesn't like anything hot but he loves these cookies! He can't seem to get enough of them. Thanks again for this keeper!",
