It has a nice sweet flavor and almost tastes like a mix between carrot cake and banana bread, but definitely still a banana bread in overall flavor and texture. I was confused by the 2 loaves suggestion. I changed the servings to 9 to make one loaf in-case that was an issue. Next time I will make the recipe exactly as is. I baked the reduced version in my 9x5 pan and it was a little short. I think that may be a misprint. The carrot amount is equivalent to about 1 large carrot. That was the most consuming part of the recipe, as the walnuts I had were already chopped. The one I made I baked for about 50 minutes, in a pan sprayed with Bakers Joy. It came out nicely. I sliced it with my bread slicer and got 16 slices. ty, I would make this for others as a food gift as suggested.",
