I mixed 1/3 cup flour into the sugar (of which I replaced half with Splenda) and mixed into the fruit. The result is a never-fail smooth lightly firm filling when baked. I used one 20 oz can of Dole crushed pineapple. Because rhubarb is out of season I was forced to resort to the Publix frozen variety. It's less tart than fresh so I also pepped up the tartness quotient with 1 Tb fresh lemon juice and the grated rind of one lemon. Added a dash each of cinnamon and mace. An unconventional combination (my daughter called it weird but that was before she tasted it!) but it works - quite well!",

Because I like pies with texture I did not mind chunks of pineapple but for someone who does pinapple tidbits instead of chunks would be a good compromise. Great with vanilla ice cream.... Just a thought: Could the reason why some cooks are having trouble with the tapioca not dissolving be that they need to use the INSTANT tapioca instead of the regular??",
