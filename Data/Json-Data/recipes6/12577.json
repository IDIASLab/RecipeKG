I followed the recipe exactly as it read and the dough came out more like cake batter. I had to add about 1 1/2 - 2 Cups more flour than the recipe originally called for then had to refrigerate the dough for about 20-30 minutes for me to be able to work with. I rolled out the dough and while it was baking I just threw the raw dough in the refrigerator to keep it nice and cool and easy to work with. Other than that little snag these cookies turned out amazing! They are really moist and fluffly!! My husband Loves them and so do I! We highly recommend them! I'll definately be making these again!! =) I made these cookies again and hand mixed in the flour/cocoa powder mix instead of using a mixer and they came out fine. i still chilled them for about 20 minutes or so and used a cookie scoop to scoop them out and they came out fine. They would still be a little to sticky to work with if you were to use your hands so i would still recommend adding a bit more flour to make the dough less sticky. But i still love these cookies and highly recommend them =)",

I used Candy Cane Hershey Kisses (a peppermint kiss with a tiny bit of crunch to it) and I swear I think I might leave my husband for these cookies. My kids who normally don't like chocolate cookies very much could not stop eating them. They got up at 5am to sneak the container of cookies into their room and pig out. I made a few with Hershey Hugs also (ran out of Candy Cane Kisses) and it was equally delicious. The mint is really perfect with the chocolate though. Love this recipe!",

I now have 78 of these yummy lovely brownie-like cookies waiting to attach themselves to my hips.:) I made the dough balls smaller (about 3/4\" diameter) and they look perfect!
