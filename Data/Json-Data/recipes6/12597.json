Well they're like shortbread cookies. They are good as basic butter cookies go. These would be wonderful with a cup of hot tea. If you do feel they need dressing up easy enough to do. I rolled some in cinnamon sugar at the suggestion of someone else here. Some others I made a deep well (don't just use your thumbprint - they spread too much) and added a dab of raspberry jam. Delicious variations! These are versatile little cookies. Eat them as is or try adding your own twist.",

My cookies had to be light brown (like the bottoms usually are) all over to get the dough cooking. Overall loved it. Would be great with tea.",

That being said I fed them to my 19 year old boys (who tend to be brutally honest) and they really liked the cookie as is. The rest of my family did too. So there you have it. It is one I would make again because it was well received by my kids. I think I will add some butter extract though and try that.",

The dough is great for cut out cookies too. I rolled it out (probably would be easier with a little refridgeration) and had wonderful little heart-shaped wafers. Reduce baking time to 7 min. in this case. I don't like the consistency when baked in \"balls\" like orig. recipe said - too cakey. Shape should be flatter. Another great shape for kids is make a snake and curve into an \"o\" shape connect and flatten a bit. Add 1/2 - 1 tsp. cinnamon for more flavour. I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 cup white - next time I think I'll try leaving the white out - they're a little too sweet.",
