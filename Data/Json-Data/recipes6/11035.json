I think I found a solution for the reviewers who didnt have enough cake batter and or too much filling left over. I only filled the liners about 1/4 for the bottom layer. I used alittle over a tablespoon of the filling. For the top layer, I only filled the liners to 2/3 full. I got 24 cupcakes, and had no batter or filling left. the amounts were perfect, for me anyways. Mine came out perfectly moist and sooooo delicious to say the least!Another thing was that I only left mine in the oven for 18 minutes , exactly so mine werent burnt on the bottom. I had no problems with the filling sinking to the bottom and that is probably due to how long I whipped it with the mixer. Very light and fluffy. I used a Devil's Food cake mix and a Chocolate Fudge frosting. \r\nIf I could I would give these a 10 star rating.\r\nThanks for the great recipe Star!!",

When I made the cupcakes it made 24 regular and 18-24 mini.  Normal box mixes make 24 but I fugured that with adding the filling, the rest of the mix had to go somewhere.  I get more compliments on this then anything I make.  I will definately try other's ideas on alterations!",

I made them for my Father-in-law's 60th b-day, and they were a huge hit! I followed the directions accordingly to measurements. I did however make the task simpler. I poured the cake batter into a ziplock and piped small amounts into the cupcake papers, so I would not overdo it, before I could get the cream chz in there. I also put the cream chz in a ziplock and did the same. Topped them off with another squirt of cake batter and popped them in the oven. To keep them from burning, Take them out when they still seem a bit jiggly. The cream chz needs time to cool, to set up. These again were awesome. And even better when they have had a few hours to cool off. I topped mine with pecan and almond frosting. Thanks for a great recipe.",

I filled about halfway full w/ cake mix, added a small tbp. of filling & then topped w/ just a bit more cake mixture. It didn't completely cover the flling but it spread while cooking & did. The filling did settle more towards the bottom but I didn't get the pit in mine that some reviewers had problems with. I did use the Betty Crocker butter recipe mix & thought they tasted great. I sprayed my muffin papers to aid in removal but not sure it was necessary. I got about 20 cupcakes & still had a little filling left over so I followed the example of other reviewers & poured it into mini-muffin tins & baked them at 300 degrees for about 30 minutes. I was transporting the cupcakes out of town so I did not frost them...I just sprinkled them w/ powdered sugar.  Thanks for a wonderful treat...everyone enjoyed them!",

I made a few changes: substituted Neufchatel for the cream cheese and made the filling with Splenda instead of sugar. I also used mini-chips since the first time I made these the filling sank to the bottom. The mini-chips work better. I used all the filling except a Tablespoon or so and had about 3/4 cup of cake batter leftover. I will do it this way next time it's better if you use lots of filling (like half batter half filling almost) then just drizzle a little more batter over the top. This makes 24 cupcakes not 12.",
