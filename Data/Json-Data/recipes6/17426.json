I took the advice of some of the previous cooks and saut\u00e9ed the kielbasa and one whole onion until golden brown. I did not use two onions that would have been way too much for us. Once sauteed I added the kielbasa and onions with the celery carrots cut in quarters and the red potatoes to the water in a big pot. For seasoning I added about 1 1/2 to 2 tsp. of dill parsley minced garlic pepper crushed bay leaves about 1/4 tsp salt and 3 cubes of bouillon. Once served I topped it with some DUBLINER cheese by Kerrygold. Its a cheese imported from Ireland so I don't know how easy it is to find I just happened to come across it... but it topped it perfect. Thanks for the recipe!",

I didn't use 2 pounds of meat I only used one pound of kielbasa which I sauteed with one chopped onion. To the pot I added the bag of baby carrots celery 4 red potatoes (chopped) one sweet potato (peeled and chopped) and 1/2 cup red lentils. I used chicken stock and added Mrs. Dash and salt and pepper. Big hit as the lentils thickened it up and added extra protein without breaking the bank. I cooked it for about 2 hours at simmer and it came out really good. I was tempted to add spinach or peas some more color but I am glad I left it as is. Great last minute meal maker.",

I found myself wishing I had. Though the soup was still okay the water seemed to tone down the flavor a lot so next time we will probably try broth and sautee all of the sausage and onion first.
