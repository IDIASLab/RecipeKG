Found this recipe and was so excited! This recipe is not bad, not exactly restaurant-style, but almost close. The portions are not right or something is missing. I can't figure it out yet. Me and my roomate agreed that it was a bit tangy (she wouldn't have it) but my husband absolutly loves this sauce and begs me to make it occasionally. I think if you add a little less rice vinegar (like 2 tblspns) and use sweet paprika it tastes better. Just adjust the portions and it will come out the way you want it.",

I moved to a new area about 6 years ago because I thought the resaurant I once frequented back home was Chinese and they served this delicous shrimp sauce. Well when I moved I figured the Chinese resaurants would serve the same. Every one I went in I asked for it and they just looked really confused brought the red sauce you sometimes dip shrimp in. Well I thought I'd make my own if I could find the recipe. Typed in the search engine on the computer and there it was. Easy as pie. Anyway I dont mean to be long winded but I really appreciate you posting the recipe.",
