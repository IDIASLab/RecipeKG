The butter really needs to be melted and mixed together with the suger before adding to the graham crackers,or it will not hold together for the crust. The Cream Cheese MUST be soften. Just leave it sit out for about 20 minutes,then while still in the inside package,lightly knead with your fingers.  I added 1 -2 T of Lemon Juice to the filling so it tasted more like a real Cheesecake.  Thank you for sharing.",

Mom usually uses cool whip.  And for the person that said the whipping cream made it too runny- did you whip  the cream first? It is a must.
