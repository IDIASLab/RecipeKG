And I used Thai chilis because you can't get jalepenos where I live (in Taiwan). I do have to say that the cold salsa seemed a little out of place with the fresh-from-the-oven salmon. It was also quite pepper heavy which would be a turn-off for people who are undecided about peppers. I would also let the salsa sit in the fridge for an hour or two before serving so the pepper essence can soak into the juice a bit more. I'll most likely make it/a close version of it again. Yum.",

I've made this twice now and the first time i was a little nervous of using 2 jalape\u00f1os because my mom really can't do spicy food so I only used one and absolutely no spice or heat could be tasted. The second time i used both jalape\u00f1os and its was MUCH better. The heat really wasn't much but it was just enough to give the dish a little zing. Will definitely be making this again!",
