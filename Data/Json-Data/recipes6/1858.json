I pulsed a whole (5.25 oz) box of Anna's Ginger Thins in my food processor, cut the butter to 5 tablespoons, and pressed the mixture into four (big) ramekins (because I also made a pecan crust). Amidst the multi-tasking Thanksgiving prep, I forgot to pre-bake the crusts before filling the ramekins, so I just baked them at 350 (placed ramekins on a cookie sheet) until the filling was done. Next time I would pre-bake (to add crispiness), but everyone still enjoyed the unique twist on pumpkin pie. I didn't have any problems with excess grease, but it may be because I used Anna's instead of a heavier gingersnap. I would love to try this crust with a Banana Cream Pie!",
