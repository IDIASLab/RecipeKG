I prefer my substitutions: frozen pineapple and agave nectar (sub for canned pineapple), chicken thighs (I personally prefer thighs), molasses (sub for brown sugar), fresh sliced ginger (plus ground ginger as per recipe) and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I also added sweet mini peppers and red onions to the slow cooker; both items caramelize in the delicious broth, plus add wonderful flavor to the chicken.  Try this recipe!  The original recipe as-is is a solid 4 star recipe, but my additions make it 5 star (IMO).  Bon appetit!",

I used two large full bone-in chicken breasts to serve three of us.  The only thing I found is that the chicken was dry.  I would suspect my crockpot runs hot.  It didn't matter to me though, because of the lucious juice that I soaked my chicken in.  I did not thicken the sauce, but I suppose some might want to.  I served with a 5-grain rice blend and no leftovers.  Chicken was all gone.  Thanks nanny. Next time I will just be aware my slow cooker is a tad warm and cook less time.",

I used 6 chicken breasts. I also cooked brown rice and when it was almost done stirred it into the crock pot about 2 hours before I was going to serve it. I always find that brown rice needs to cook a little longer than the directions state but I didn't want it too mushy. Overall it was good but next time I'll add more red bell pepper and a green bell pepper (I didn't have one in the house today and was too busy to run to the store). I'll also cut back on the Brown Sugar and/or honey. This was a little too sweet. I'll either add a little more soy sauce or some chicken broth. All in all it was very easy and a good meal.",

I used two breast halves and two thigh quarters.  The dark meat was moister (as expected) than the white meat, although the white meat was still wonderful.  I served this over white rice and served \u2018Ken Shoe Green Beans\u2019 on the side.  I strained the juice to get out the little pieces of bone that came off the chicken while cooking, and we poured the juice over the chicken and rice.  This is a winner, nanny.
