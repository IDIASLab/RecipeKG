My boyfriend was skeptical of the apple in the salad, but he ended up having seconds and so did I. The creamy avocado, tangy hearts of palm and sweet apple blend together so well.  I used extra avocado and cut the apple down to one. I think it would also taste good with some crumbly cheese like bleu or goat cheese.",
