That being said I\u2019d reduce the amount of molasses; I think it\u2019s a good flavor in the bread, but it\u2019s a little overwhelming. I also think I\u2019m going to add crushed pecans into the batter next time for some more texture. On the icing, I added more butter than requested having tasted it as I went.",

I sprinkled some extra ginger on top before baking since I like ginger *a lot.*  It was pretty good on day one, and downright delicious on day two.   Next time I make it, though, I'm going to try to remember to make the glaze...oops.\nUPDATE 04/05/20: Made it again, this time with the glaze.  Lacking corn syrup, I used honey in its place and am very pleased with the results.  Also added a touch of ginger--maybe 1/4 tsp? Didn't actually measure--to the icing.  :::kisses fingertips::: Delicious!",
