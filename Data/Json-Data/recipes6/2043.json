Use butter and once the ingredients come to a full boil DO NOT boil for more than 1 minute. It won t hold the puffed wheat together and set well.",

I made 1 1/2 recipes of the goo for the 8 cups of puffed wheat and honestly I can't imagine what it would taste like with only one! Next time I will double the batch of goo as it still wasn't quite as gooey as I had hoped even with the 1 1/2 times the goo. I loved the cinnamon addition to it as well although only added 1/2 tsp as recommended by some other reviewers - I didn't have cloves to try in it. Great recipe but if you like your squares gooier just make a larger batch of the goo or add less puffed wheat for a smaller pan.",
