There are a few tips that will ensure your brownies are not cakey. I do not use a mixer because you can overmix your batter and whip too much air into the eggs. This makes your brownies have a cakey texture. Mix everything by hand in a bowl and lightly beat your eggs before adding them to the mixture. Gently stirring everything together makes them turn out better as opposed to franticly beating the mixture. Hope this helps, because I will NEVER buy brownie mix again.",

The problem with the frosting is that you need to halve the amount of powdered sugar and melt the butter.  This makes a glaze that you can spread on top.  It hardens into a beautiful, shiny frosting.  I thought some of the info in the reviews was conflicting, so here's the scoop:  1.  These are neither \"cake\" brownies nor \"fudge\" brownies; they fall somewhere in between.  If you must have one or the other, then this recipe is not for you.  2.  Yes, the frosting is sweet.  If you like frosting, then add it, if not, leave it off.  3.  Yes, these are homemade brownies and do not taste like boxed brownie mix.  I can't understand why anyone would prefer a mix to homemade, but if that's your thing, then stick with the mix.",

Just mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon in the same pan as you melted the butter, about 50 strokes, just until good and combined. The frosting is glossy and smooth if you melt the butter first and add about 1 T. each of corn syrup and half and half. Cutting these with a plastic knife, even the disposable tableware variety, works great!  Cuts cleanly, and not a crumb sticks to the knife. Had to try 3 of the brownies as soon as they were cooled, just to be triply sure they were good.",

No need to beat with mixer.  A wooden spoon to mix the batter until everything is wet works just fine.\nI used the frosting recipe which was very fudge-like and thick.

Mama Cass hit the nail on the head saying this was neither a \"fudgy\" brownie nor a \"cake-like\" brownie, but both - that's what made it so awesome.  I didn't have the honey for the frosting so frosted it with the best chocolate frosting IMO - boil 3TB butter, 1/3 c sugar, 2TB milk for a minute, remove from heat and add 1/3 c chocolate chips.  Yummmm!  Doubt anyone will read this after 1,000 some reviews, but just realized this recipe is similar to one a use for waffle cookies - only I melt the butter and cocoa powder in the microwave together and it mixes together much easier.
