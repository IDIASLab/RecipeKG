                "reviewBody": "I've made this recipe twice in the last 3 days.  Here's my strong suggestions:  DO NOT soak the rice.  The milk needs the starch from the rice in order to properly thicken.  If there isn't enough starch, the pudding will be thin/runny.  \n\nUse GROUND RICE!  In your blender or food processor - grind about 3/4 cup rice as much as possible - there will remain some coarsely ground grains - this is perfect!    \n\nWhole milk works best.  However, if you're looking to  reduce fat - I discovered that using a combination of 2 c. whole milk and 6 c. 2% milk is good.  Just increase the rice a little bit to avoid a slightly thin pudding.  \n\nSubstitute a scant 1/2 tsp ground cardamom for the pods.  However, I strongly suggest increasing the rose water a bit because the ground cardamom will drown out the rose water. \n\nCUT WAY BACK ON THE SUGAR!  No more than 1 cup unless you want very sweet pudding.  I preferred the taste using only 3/4 cup sugar.  \nQuicker preparation:  Bring milk to a boil; reduce heat, add ground rice and simmer 25 minutes (stir occasionally).   Add cardamom & sugar; simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat & add rose water.  Almonds can be optional... top pudding with chopped pistachio nuts.\n\nWhen the pudding cools pour into a ceramic bowl, or individual ramekins; refrigerate until cold and set.  \n5 stars with alterations - otherwise a 3+/4-",

                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe! I had Kheer for the first time yesterday at an Indian restaurant. I liked it so much that I immediately came home and started looking for a recipe. I used this recipe and it was just as delicious as what I had at the restaurant. I made it almost exactly like the recipe except for just a couple of minor changes. For example I only had cardamom seeds in my pantry so I crushed these and added approximately 1/2 of a teaspoon in place of the cardamom pods. This worked out very well and gives it a delicious flavor. The rose water is a very nice and subtle addition but I'm sure the Kheer would still be delicious if you don't have any on hand. I noticed that a previous reviewer thought that it needed more rice but I think this is probably the correct amount. The one that I had at the restaurant didn't even have this much rice in it. It was almost soupy enough to drink which I presume is the way it is supposed to be. Since I was somewhat rushed I didn't take time to soak the rice but just rinsed it a few times in cold water. That seemed to be sufficient and I don't think it made much of a difference. I cooked mine uncovered as I was afraid that it would boil over and I couldn't watch it the whole time. I just kept it on a low simmer and stirred it now and then. This is a very sweet dessert and you can safely reduce the sugar just a tad if you prefer. I used sliced almonds which had been toasted lightly. This is good warm but is even better after",

I worried that the kheer was too thin so I raised the heat and boiled some of the milk off. However when the kheer cooled it was too thick. So I think the rice/milk proportion stated in the recipe is correct. Also the rose water has a very strong flavor; I was not very careful measuring it and so the rose water overwhelmed the cardamom flavor. And I mixed in raisins & slivered almonds in the end. Overall this is a very good recipe.",

I also cut back on the sugar a little...I used 1 1/4 cups. The recipe as it is scaled makes a lot of pudding...it doesn't cook down much since there is no boiling involved. Next time I will scale down by half since I am the only one in my family who likes pudding (I just don't get it)! Shazia I make your Pasanday often and now this will be a regular treat too!
