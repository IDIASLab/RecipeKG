I made one big mistake and realized that my can of black beans was really a can of dark kidney beans. The dish still came out really well though next time I'll be making it with the black beans (which are my favorite!) For a little more flavor I'll add a diced jalapeno as well. My only complaint is the amount of sauce! So much as just sitting at the bottom so next time I will reduce that not quite by half. Thanks for the great cold NO COOK bean salad!",
