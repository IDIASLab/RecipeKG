Baked first and then after adding the marshmallows and chocolate chips put it under low broil for a few minutes, watching it the whole time and removed when the marshmallows turned to a golden brown.  Super easy, quick dessert enjoyed by all!!",

I don't mind it because that's what you expect from a good s'more. Just have a glass of milk handy and cut in small squares. Mine also didn't brown at the normal temp - I was using my convection/toaster oven so I set it to toast to get the brown on the mallows and that did the trick. And a note if it's helpful to anyone - 9 graham cracker sheets was the right amount for me not squares. I always get confused about which a recipe means. This took a full sleeve of graham crackers for the crust. I pulsed up the crust in the food processor and microwaved the butter to melt it and it took no time at all. The only thing I might change next time is I would try dark chocolate chips and maybe a light sprinkle of sea salt and I'd reduce the butter slightly. I don't think it needs quite as much as it takes.",
