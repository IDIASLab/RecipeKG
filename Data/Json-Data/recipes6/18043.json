                "reviewBody": "This recipe is sometimes called Eskimo Cookies. But this seems to have less sugar & butter. I made this with my 7th grade Home Ec class. During exam week I had an extra period with one class. I needed something fun yet educational & could be done in a regular classroom. This was a perfect recipe! I changed the yield to 18 so the recipe would use 1 stick of butter (we used margarine). The only change I would make is reducing some of the sugar. Many students liked the recipe as is but since I changed the yield the sugar measurement is a bit wonky (1/2 cup 1 Tbsp). I would take the 1 Tbsp out and see how it works out. For teachers: 90-min block with a lunch period in the middle. I chilled the cookies during the lunch period but there is plenty of time even without. If I had a 45-min period I would (or have the students the previous class) pre-measure the dry ingredients so all they have to do is dump it in a bowl add wet & mix. Then put in freezer for 10-15 min & eat. I used this as an example of something to do when baby sitting children (not too young & always ask the parents). It is a good recipe because it is has some redeeming nutrition (fiber- but we also discuss the high sugar & fat content) has no peanut butter (since many kids have allergies) doesn t need heat (oven or stove) & kids can use hands to mix ingredients.",
