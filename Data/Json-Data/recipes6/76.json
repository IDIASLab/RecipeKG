This is our version of their sage cream sauce (even though we don't use sage in our recipe). It is basically all the sweetest tastes of Thanksgiving in a ravioli dish. If you prefer a thinner sauce, add a little more cream.",

I did add 1/2 tsp. sage as others suggested (if you like it, which I do); I took others' suggestion and only added 1 tsp. brown sugar instead of 1 tbsp., and used 1 c. skim milk plus 1/2-2/3 c. half and half. For the finishing touch, I thought \"wow, I have a bottle of whiskey just sitting there, I wonder how that would be??\"  So I added 1/4 c. whiskey....Let me tell you, that was the best way to finish this sauce!! Terrific! We served it on Trader Joe's Butternut Squash ravioli with grilled chicken breasts and fresh butternut squash chunks.  Amazing!!",

This is actually what i was hoping for... and i should have stopped and scooped some of the sauce out for my dinner here but i kept on with the recipe. Version 2: add the creme this had me concerned because first it thickened up almost into a paste... but then once i got to a certain point of creme ( 1 full cup?) it turned back into a fluid sauce. I only had 1 cup of creme in my fridge so i didn't use the full 1 1/2 cups in the recipe. This also tasted great and had more body than version one. I DID scoop some of this out and save but it was enough for 3 ravioli. Version 3: i added in the final ingredients... nutmeg cinnamon brown sugar. (no salt or pepper as i don't use them often anyways). After taste testing i thought it was good but not the sauce i was hoping for. Too sweet for my more hearty craving (although it would be great for a sweet craving). However once I put it on the raviolis it actually worked GREAT!!! All three variations are delicious Personally I'll probably stick with v1 or v2 depending on whether I feel like eating a light or heavy sauce and only use v3 around the holidays",
