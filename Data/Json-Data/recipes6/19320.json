However after marinating the asparagus overnight I decided to ad lib the final touches. I tossed the marinated spears onto the grill at the last moment. After plating the beautifully grilled spears I added the green onion and sprinkled them with slivered almonds that had been toasted in the oven. THEY WERE DELICIOUS!! I will make this dish again and again!!",

My parents both loved it...in fact, my dad raved about it for the entire weekend.  I only marinated it for a couple of hours, and it still was divine.  The next day, I'd left it in the bag with the marinade, and it was even better.  Will be making this recipe again and again--a permanent favorite.",
