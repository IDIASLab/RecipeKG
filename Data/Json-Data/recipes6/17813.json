Using a pan for tartes is good because you get a good piece of cake, but the thickness won't be too much.)  Be prepared for the sweetness of it because there is a lot of sugar in the cake.  Also, I would recommend refrigerating the cake for longer than 1 hour because the colder the cheesecake, the better it will taste and also, the easier it will be to get out of the pan.\r\n - I was able to make this recipe living in France, where they have no such thing as real cream cheese or real sour cream.  They have similiar variations which proved to be just fine.",

I think it was caused by the confectioners sugar. So if I try this again, I will omit the sour cream topping and use only white sugar in the cheesecake (and cut the sugar down to 1 and 1/4 cups max). Then I will put fresh blueberries on each slice right before serving. I also found that I had to bake it for almost an hour rather than the 25 minutes stated in the recipe. It hadn't set at all at that point.",
