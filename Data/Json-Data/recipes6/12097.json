I ended up adding about 3 1/2c flour and to get it out of the mixing bowl and then had about 1/2c on the counter for rolling etc. I also added some lemon extract. Was a great little extra taste that you really couldn't taste in the dough but the finished cookie was awesome. I frosted them with royal or butter cream icing and they always are a hit.",

The recipe worked great and since kids were already Hyper enough for me we decided not to decorate them and it was perfect. It wasn't over sweet and it tasted great. I recommend this for any mom trying to find something with less sugar for their kids to eat.",
