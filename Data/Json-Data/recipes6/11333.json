The first step that uses butter should say to melt only half the butter to fry the coconut - it doesn't say that but later says use the remaining butter.  Don't mess up this step otherwise you'll have really greasy coconut.  I had to drain mine twice on papertowels.  Otherwise, it was good.  The frosting didn't make as much as I would have liked so I'd double the frosting.",

Both the cake and the frosting were a disaster. I only deviated from the recipe in that I omitted the nuts. The cake was nowhere near fully baked after 35 minutes - I had to put it in again for about another 20 minutes at least...and then it was super crumbly. I think there was too much egg in the batter. The frosting was impossible to spread smoothly which made the crumbly cake fall apart even more! In hindsight this is not too surprising - there is not much of anything moist added to the cream cheese in order to give it a cake-frosting consistency. I am not a novice baker so I probably should have followed my instincts a little more but I guess I was fooled by all the glowing reviews this recipe recieved. No one said they changed anything. I have a hard time believing that following this recipe exactly could yield a good cake...anyway there are a lot of other coconut cake recipes out there so next time I'll try a different one!",

                "reviewBody": "This cake is very good!! But... I did make a couple of changes. I used 3 Jumbo eggs 1/3 cup oil and omitted the walnuts. I toasted the coconut in a 350 degree oven for about 10 mins before adding to the cake mixture. Also a couple of points the recipe does not point out.... The 4 Tbsp. of butter is divided 2 Tbsp for the toasting of the frosting coconut & 2 Tbsp for mixing in the frosting itself. I used 2 round non-stick dark cake pans and one regular round cake pan. The non-stick dark layers were a bit overdone at 30 MINUTES and the regular pan was perfect. So be sure to watch your cakes closely as 35 mins seemed too long when you are dividing the cake mix into 3 round cake pans. As for the frosting it's very yummy but I had to add 1/2 a can of vanilla frosting to make enough for the whole cake. Next time I will 1 1/2 the recipe! You will not be disappointed just be sure to watch your baking time!! YUMMY!!",

                "reviewBody": "I scaled this recipe down (from the original 12 to 9) which was the perfect amount to make 12 standard size cupcakes. I baked them at 350 for 20 to 25 minutes and they turned out great - just make sure to bake until the tops are dry although the cake will seem firm when the top is still sticky. I'm a pastry chef and I work for a cupcake exclusive bakery in Austin TX so I suppose this is kind of my specialty. As for the cake mix if you don't have a box of cake mix then you can always make your own using \"Cake Mixes from Scratch\" recipe on this site. Half of that recipe will be just enough. As for the icing it is absolutely divine but it needs to be refrigerated for 10-15 minutes before you use it. Toasting the coconut was a lot less complicated that it's made out to be. I put it on medium heat and just kept the coconut moving the entire time and then I poured it out of the pan onto a paper plate with some napkins. Make sure your cakes are completely cooled before you try to ice them as cream cheese icing is notorious for melting easily. If you get impatient then just throw them in the fridge for a while like I did - you definitely do NOT have to worry about these drying out. I think the pudding is really the key to all the great moisture but it makes the texture a bit heavier than a regular cake. Either way it's a wonderful recipe and a great deviation from the standard variety of cakes.",

I basically followed the recipe except for a few minor changes. I used pecans instead of walnuts and I added some a bit of crushed pineapple to the batter. I used a 9 x 13 in. glass pan. Also I made sure to mix the everything for at least 4 mins so the pudding mix would thicken. I did have to bake it for more than 30 mins - maybe 35-40. The frosting was delicious and the toasted coconut was the perfect final touch. Thanks for the recipe.",
