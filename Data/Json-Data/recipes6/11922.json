I did bump the flour up to 1 cup - everything else was great. I have found that ANY COOKIE baked until the edges are golden are ALWAYS too done and end up hard. I figure when the start to firm up when you touch the tops - just like cakes - they are done. A trick a friend of mine shared with me (from her Grandmother) is when cookies get hard put them in a plastic bag with a piece of white bread. I don't know the science behind it or how they figured it out but IT WORKS! Soft cookies again. I added 1/3 c. cocoa and yummy. I got 33 cookies. Thanks for sharing.",

I read the comments and changed the ingredients accordingly using 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1/2 1 cup flour instead of 3/4 1/2 cup margarine instead of shortening and 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of nuts as well as baking for 8 minutes. There didn't appear to be much batter in the bowl so I wondered how many it would actually make and it was very very moist (probably because I melted my butter). I rolled them into balls with my hands as I like to do though I made them small and widely spaced apart in case they flattened. They actually didn't flatten at all! And because I used small bits of batter to begin with I found out they puff up quite a lot so you could get more cookies if you used less batter. All up it made about 20 cookies so still not a whole lot but a decent amount. The coffee grounds give a sort of crunch to them as if I had put nuts in them and it's enjoyable. Next time I make them I'm considering dissolving the grounds in water first to see how that turns out.",

I also used a single serving packet of Starbucks instant coffee - which I just happened to have and I think because STarbucks is normally strong coffee one packet worked (compared to 1T v. 2T.) I didn't have nuts which I think would have held the cookie together and kept it from spreading. I always double the vanilla. I also added 1/4 C flour like the other reviewer suggested. The cookie tastes great! The batch made 30 cookies. I only spooned the 1t as the recipe suggested. They spread a lot! They are thin and waferlike but like I said I think the nuts would have held it together better. 8 minutes baking time was perfect as well. I topped them off with Halloween colored sprinkles for interest. I would definitely make again! YUM!",
