First I didn't mix the parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs but sprinkled a little on top after frying. Also I breaded a whole bunch at one time and put them on cookie sheets and stacked them up and froze them for a couple of hours and then put them in freezer bags for later use rather than breading them every time I want some. I also use ranch dressing instead of spaghetti sauce and Mozzerella cheese. They taste just like fried zucchini that I used to get at Coco's restaurant in Tucson. Wonderful side dish. UPDATE: I now use only panko bread crumbs. I also add onion powder and some dried parsley to the bread crumbs. I tried to dip them in flour prior to putting them in the egg as some have suggested but then I had trouble getting the egg to stick to the zucchini. The egg sticks to the zucchini just fine without the flour.",

Just without the parm and seasonings; flour salt and pepper did the trick. I made this recipe AS IS but adding Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs and it is fantastic!! I did try the 'cover with flour' technique but usually when i do that i add cornstarch just to make it even more crispy. Still made it taste great! Plus my 2 yr old son wouldn't stop grabbing them off my plate. Definitely a permanent keeper for my book.",

Having the oil at the right temperature is important in this recipe...too hot and it will burn quickly not hot enough and the zucchini just sits and soaks up oil. I used more oil and kept it at 350-375 degrees frying just a few pieces at a time. Can't wait for next year's zucchini crop to do this one again.",

I first sliced the zucchini into 1/4 inch slices and let them dry out on a paper towel on the counter for about a half hour. I then coated them with flour mixed with salt and pepper. Then I dipped them in the egg flavoured with a little hot sauce. I then mixed bread crumbs with fresh chopped parsley and cajun seasoning. I then put them on a plate single layer and refridgerated them for about an hour or so. I then fried them up about half a dozen slices at a time. Once they were golden brown I added just a touch more salt and pepper while they were still hot. I didn't have any cheese on hand or tomato sauce but I can't see those ingredients adding anything but more yummy flavour! These turned out amazing! I can't wait to make this again and next time I will add the cheese and tomato sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!",
