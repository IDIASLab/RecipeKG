If you have a loquat tree, wait until the loquats are yellow before picking. Once the jam cooks long enough, the loquats turn a lovely orange-pink color. This is wonderful on buttered toast, but my favorite way to enjoy it is with some salty cheese.",

It is very sweet, which is to be expected, since the fruit is very sweet to start with.  Mine did not turn pink, but it came together well, and retains a good fruit flavor.  Will make again next year when the loquats come in.",
