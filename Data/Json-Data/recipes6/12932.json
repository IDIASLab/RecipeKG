I ruined a few dozen cookies trying to figure out the trick to this recipe. Follow my advice exactly and you shouldn't have a problem. 1) DO NOT make these cookies without either a silpat or parchment paper. Greasing the cookie sheet is not enough. The cookies will still stick like cement. 2) These cookies spread - A LOT. Place only 9 teaspoon-sized drops on a standard sized sheet. Any more than that and they will spread together into one big cookie. 3) Bake for only 9 minutes. They won't look done but they are. 4) Follow the instructions of leaving the cookies on the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a rack. Any less time and you will completely mutilate the cookies. Don't let my comments scare you away from this recipe - the cookies are fabulous!",

The only things i will add is 1)dont necissarily bake them for 9 minutes i took mine out at that point and they were a little tiny bit but enough to spoil them raw in the middle i went with 10 minutes. this will depend on your oven. 2)the recipe calls for toffee bits and then the directions say to add the chocolate covered caramels i didnt know what was accurate. i used the toffee bits. turned out great. i will make them many more times thank you",
