I used one cup of butter instead of the shortening and I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 3 tablespoons lemon juice and put it in a one cup measuring cup and then filled the rest of the measuring cup up with milk (a buttermilk subsitute) and the cookies turned out great. The only thing that surprised me was that the recipe stated that it makes 2 dozen I ended up with over 40 cookies and had to triple the frosting (and the cookies I made were very large). That's okay because I had plenty to give away to family. Overall it's a very yummy and soft cookie that I will make again.",

My advice - if you are looking for a traditional \"eat it plain\" sugar cookie - this is not it. If you're looking for an dense cakelike base cookie to add a sweet frosting - awesome!",

The cookies are also really bland so frosting is the only thing that adds flavor to them. This is the recipe for you if this is the type of \"cookie\" you want. It seems like the cake you would use for Boston Cream Pie or a sponge cake filled with strawberries. In fact I think serving these topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream would be delicious. If you're going to use these as cookies I suggest substituting real butter for the shortening to add more flavor and baking them for 12-13 minutes to create a little more of a cookie texture but they're still going to be little sponge cakes!",

The prep time for us only took about 15 minutes...we used a measuring spoon to scoop the dough...it worked like an ice cream scooper! And we lightly sprayed the cookie sheets instead of using parchment paper. The 1st few batches we made we added sprinkles before baking...the last couple batches we added the icing and then set them in the frige to harden. In less than 2 hours we had all the cookies made and passed out to our neighbors for the Holidays! And they all loved the cookies!!! So thanks so much for a great easy and fast receipe!!!!",
