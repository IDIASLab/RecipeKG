I prepared ingredients as instructed but I did a few things differently:\n\n1.  I removed the chicken from the wok as soon as it was cooked so that it wouldn't get dry, and then I  put it back int the wok once the broccoli had cooked for a few minutes (had turned a slightly emerald/deep green).\n\n2.  I put in most but not all of the soy sauce mixture (into which I had also add fresh garlic/ginger and not powdered).\n\n3.  I only added about half of the cornstarch/water mix.  I suggest adding a little at a time \u2014 if you are cooking at a med high/high heat you will be able to tell when you have enough.\n\nThese little changes really helped and allowed for moist chicken, crunchy but well cooked broccoli and a not-too goopy sauce!",

I also added minced garlic and ginger to the soya sauce mixture.  Once I mixed up the chicken with the sauce I added hot sauce (since I love my food spicy).  It came out great.

Followed what other reviewers said and cut the soy sauce by one third, and only used the portion of sauce and cornstarch mixture that seemed right for the total amount of food while finishing the cooking. But first I cooked the chicken and onions with some minced garlic, then set aside the chicken pieces do they would not over cook, added and fried the broccoli, and added then back the chicken before adding the sauce and corn starch. And, because I love red bell pepper and had one, I added it in a 3/4 inch dice. Another variation I may try in the future--add whole cashews near the end. Would go perfectly in this.",
