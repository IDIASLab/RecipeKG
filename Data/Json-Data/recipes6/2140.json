I like the idea of a Worcestershire that is fish free too. The only thing iI didn't care for was the cinnamon. I thought that was too evident. I ended up making a second batch without the cinnamon completely and I liked that so I mixed them together. This was better for me. I also added a bit of tapioca powder to help it thicken. This is definitely a sauce to keep handy. Thank you mlally for your recipe.",
