The second time I made some chages that I think made it better:  I used a pint of grape tomatoes cut in half, 1 red onion, and a green pepper.  It gave it a little more color and texture.  I also used bow-ties, which made it a little easier to handle, the macaroni is hard when you don't have anything to hold it together, and doubled the ground mustard for extra flavor.  Very refreshing and perfect for a summer party!",

I also used a whole english cucumber instead of the 4 the recipe called for an entire bunch of green onion instead of 2 regular onions and added about a half of a green pepper as well. It's just delicious and I will definitely definitely make it again.............soon.",
