It will be a much more gooey soft center. Just use plenty of dough around it so it doesn't leak. It takes a few to practice but they'll turn out great.

I used the smaller sized rolos though that you can buy in a bag so maybe I was using less dough? They look just as big as in the picture though. Freezing the rolos for an hour or so beforehand is a good idea - I did this and no caramel leaked out.",
