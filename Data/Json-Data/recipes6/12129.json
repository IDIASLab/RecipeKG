The key to making these soft and chewy in the middle is to cool them on wax paper rather then a cooling rack.  Cooling them on a rack allows cold air to circulate around and through the cookie as it cools, which causes them to become crunchy.  If you cool on wax paper no air gets THROUGH the cookie so they stay warm longer and doughy inside.  This tip works well for Chocolate chip and sugar cookies too. Try these, they are wonderful!!!  ",

Used 1/2 c. each of brown and white sugar.  Added some vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I like things very spicy, and although I used slightly heaping measurements of the spices, I didn't double them and they were perfect and in the right proportions.  These somehow have a buttery taste to them.  soft but not a cakey cookie, crisp around the edges, the molasses flavor comes through nicely and is not covered up by spice.  you can tell the molasses is in there.  thanks so much for this wonderful recipe when one doesn't have enough butter or shortening. I should add that I have found in the past that a cookie made w/oil will tend to get a bit hard or crisp by the next day.  Just stick a slice of bread in the cookie jar to keep them soft.",

I will definitely add these cookies to my repertoire along with snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies. I didn't change anything (even though I was tempted to) other than taking them out after 10 minutes and doubling the recipe. I would definitely recommend doubling the recipe as you will undoubtedly have the demand for them. I have since made a vegan version using egg replacer and these cookies were equally good.

Only diff in mine is I use no cloves and there is a bit of salt added. Oh...and never never would I add vanilla to this cookie - the molasses and ginger and cinnamon are the stars here. Also the bake time is a bit long here - I never bake for more than 10 minutes and usually take them out at 9. We like these soft and chewy so if you do as well then you won't want to bake them for over 10 minutes. This is an AWESOME cookie and has always been a favorite in my household. EDIT This recipe identical to the Ginger Crinkles recipe here except for these have cloves. I would think that both cookies would be deelish - but the cloves would provide a bit of a spicier cookie. You can't go wrong with either one!",
