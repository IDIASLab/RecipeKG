I worked with this just a little and came up with a dessert that three people nearly devoured completely at one sitting and made a cheesecake lover out of one of them (that would be Hubs, who insists no cheese of any kind belongs in dessert). I reduced the butter to 5 T. in the crust and the sugar to 2 T.  - graham crackers, of course, are already sweet!  With the fairly standard rule of thumb for cheesecakes in mind of 1 pkg. cream cheese to 1 egg and 1/4 cup sugar, I added an extra package of cream cheese to the filling, along with a teaspoon and a half of vanilla.  The topping is just fine as written, I just subbed frozen, sliced strawberries for the blueberries in order to use what I had available. Real whipped cream was the finishing touch.  Absolutely delicious.",

Also, the picture was of a PIE....not an 8x11 glass dish.   I opted for the glass dish (8 1/2 x 11).  I also used 12 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream and a dash of vanilla.
