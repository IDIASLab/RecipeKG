I like using McIntosh apples as they are an excellent baking apple with not too much liquid, but other types like Lobo can be used. This is a super easy recipe for apple pie and makes a spectacular presentation at a dinner party.",

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and still found it a bit too sweet for my taste. I think I will reduce it to 1/4 cup next time. That might also prevent the excess brown sugar from leaking out of the tart, but it's basically caramel and tastes really good!",
