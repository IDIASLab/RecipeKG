I used gorgonzola cheese & loved the flavor it added & I topped the salad w/ some leftover grilled chicken. This did make wayy to much dressing for the salad put it is a good dressing that can be used for many other salads...it was kinda reminiscent of French dressing but lighter. Served the salad w/  gewurztraminer (a white wine that pairs really well w/ both chicken & pears) & some club crackers & it was a very nice, Spring meal that was super easy.",
