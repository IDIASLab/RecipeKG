The trick to a nice pocket is to not over handle the dough too much. I learned this from a friend who is Israeli. We love pita and I will be using this recipe again...it's a real keeper. For those of you without a bread machine, proof dry yeast in warm water with the sugar. When foamy add oil and pour into the flour that has already been mixed with salt. Knead by hand or machine until it's smooth and elastic. You should have a moderate dough (not soft and not firm, in the middle). Don't worry if it's a little sticky. You'll need to roll it out with a little flour.",

I rolled the bread into 4-5 mm thick circles and cooked each side for about 1 min or so until there were small lightly brown circles on both sides ,(heat knob turned half way). \r\nThey were 1000 times better then the ones u buy from the shops and whole family loved them.",

As I do not have a bread machine, I had to do it by hand by first proofing the yeast with the water and sugar for 10 minutes,then adding the rest together and kneading until smooth, letting it rise for about 1 1/2 hours, until it doubled, then continuing with the rest of the instructions. I did not need to add any more or less flour as with most other bread recipes. It was beautiful!! I also added about 1 tsp of dill weed and some cumin seeds during mixing. It puffed up perfectly in the oven, and I had no problems with it being too hard or crusty. I used the pitas to make falafels, and the finished product was amazing!! I would definately recommend this recipe.",

I don't have a breadmaker so I disolved the yeast in warm water, added the remaining ingrediants and mixed and kneaded for apprx 8 min (or until it felt right). I let it rise for 1.5 hours (until dough had doubled in size) and then followed the recipe per instructed. My oven produced 8 beautiful pitas that are pretty tasty and were easy to make. Just as good as store bought! I used these for \"Pork Sausage & Cabbage Pitas\" from this site and lunch yesterday was delicious! Thanks Sandy!",
