I find that if you melt all of the chocolate chips and beat them into the batter, the cake turns out much creamier, smoother, and with a more even, pleasing, delicious taste, and it looks better as well.  With the chocolate chips, they turn into hard crunchy chocolate pieces once the cake is cool, but if you melt and mix them the cake is completely creamy and has a better flavor.  It did have a few cracks in it, but those might be eliminated by placing the springform pan in a roasting pan of boiling water while it bakes.",

I did make a few modifications: used chocolate graham crackers(crushed) mixed with some oreo crumbs for the crust(no need for cocoa). I also added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips into the batter-1/3 didn't seem like enough. Using fat free condensed milk & 1/3 reduced fat cheese worked amazingly to save on fat & calories.  This will be made again for the holidays!  Thank you for a good recipe!",

Just wanted you folks to know, leave the cocoa out of the crust, and omit the chocolate chips, and this is a great basic cheesecake recipe from which many variations can be made. My current favourite variation: replace graham cracker crumbs with crushed shortbread, omit cocoa, add zest of one lemon to the batter, and swirl melted seedless raspberry jam on the top with a toothpick prior to baking. Tomorrow I'm going to try adding lime zest to the batter and topping the baked, cooled cake with a layer of store-bought key lime curd. The possibilities are countless! I'm so glad many of you enjoy the recipe!",

Of course you can use plain graham cracker for the crust, omit the choc chips and top with fruit for an alternative. EITHER WAY, THIS IS THE ONLY CHEESECAKE RECIPE YOU WILL EVER NEED! 5 STARS!",

I prefer a little tartness to my cheesecake, but this is perfect for those that want a smooth and creamy texture and a traditional taste. By the way, it doesn't matter what you do to the chocolate chips, they're going to sink to the bottom. Also, I strongly suggest baking this in a water bath - set the cheesecake pan in a larger pan that has water in it. That's the only way to bake anything that has a cheesecake/custardlike texture. If you don't, it'll crack and can dry out. Follow the baking directions to a T and you should be fine. Use an oven thermometer because all ovens vary. You should have a flawless looking cheesecake you'd be proud to serve to anyone. ",
