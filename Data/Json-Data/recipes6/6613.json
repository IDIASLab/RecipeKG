It is a mild tasting casserole that is perfect for kids who dicriminating palates nix all veggies except corn! I added a tsp. of worshshires(sp?) sauce & the cheese on top is really not needed.

I saw others' comments about the recipe being bland and I think that is because the recipe is very light on the spices. A \"pinch\" is not nearly enough of any of the spices. I used a generous 1/2 tsp each of the onion powder garlic powder and salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. I also used more evaporated milk than the recpie called for because it was really really thick. With extra milk the consistency was great. We loved it and I will definitely make this again for a super-quick and easy weeknight meal.",
