I used all butter rather than shortening/margarine and left out the baking soda (by accident at first but then I realized that the cake layers came out flat and thin i.e. easy to stack and ice without the soda). When I made the two-tier wedding cake I doubled the recipe to make the bottom 12\" diameter tier and I didn't have to adjust the baking time or anything. HIGHLY recommended including the frosting. Even avowed pineapple haters liked this cake.",

I tripled the recipe made it in 2 14\" square pans. The changes that I made were using 2 large cans of crushed drained pineapple. I cut the amount of pecans in half in the batter. Left them out of the frosting and coated the outside wall of the cake in crushed pecans. I decreased the sugar by one half of a cup. I also added a package of dream whip to the batter. It really was very moist and delicious. I may use this recipe for my friends upcoming fall wedding cake!",

The icing was smooth and perfect..so smooth in fact that I couldnt bring myself to mix in the chopped pecans but instead sprinkled them over the top and sides of the cake as a garnish. I also prepared it as a two 9 inch layer cake, instead of the three 8 inch layer which worked very well. My whole family loved it, even my sisters 3 yr old son :) I would defintely recommend this cake!",
