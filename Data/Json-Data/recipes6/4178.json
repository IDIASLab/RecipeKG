Wasn't sure about the \"chorizo chopped\" - I'm assuming it is supposed to be Mexican chorizo but that kind needs to be removed from the casing and cooked/crumbled in the pot so that's what I did. It can't really be \"chopped\" before cooking. I didn't have garlic juice on hand so I just used 3 garlic cloves minced. The only other changed I made was to add in the onions to the pot as the ground sirloin was almost done browning. The chorizo cinnamon and chocolate really make this chili so don't leave them out! So much depth to the flavors. I can see why this recipe one so many chili cook-offs! Looking forward to leftovers!",

I added another oz. of chocolate, which was good, and chopped up 2 poblano peppers. The whole thing is a thick delicious chili with tons of depth.
