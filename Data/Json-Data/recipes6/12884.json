I sized the recipe down to 6 servings which is easy on the AR app for hubs,and I to enjoy a sweet treat on a Indian Summer evening. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla after being puzzled as to why it wasnt on the list of ingredients, since it's a standard brown,and white sugar butter cookie dough which always include vanilla extract. I also added chopped pecans because I had them and wanted some nuts to balance out the M& M's. I also turned down the oven to 300 degrees as the cookie bars started to brown around the ages too rapidly. The cookie bars took about 25 minutes to bake and they came out of the oven very puffed and golden. We liked these candy Bar squares better than a candy bar brownie recipe found on Allrecipes.",
