The original Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe from Quaker Oats is usually found right under the lid of the canister of Quaker Oats. The recipe is exactly the same except for one ingredient the original recipe calls for cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice we think the cinnamon taste much better in the cookies of course the raisins and nuts are optional that s up to your taste. If you do use raisins try softening them before you put them in the cookies it keep the texture more moist I like to make mine a little bigger and don t over bake them keep them nice and soft. I always use butter never margarine but that s also your personal taste.",

Additionally I used dark chocolate chips and chopped mixed nuts. SOOOOOO yummy. Next time I might substitute apple sauce for half the butter to make it a little more healthy.",
