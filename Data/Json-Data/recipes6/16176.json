Even though I used chilled butter as called for it wasn't until I added two tablespoons more of both brown sugar and flour that I got a true streusel consistency. As written the streusel is too heavy with butter. Had I used the streusel as is while I'm sure it would have been acceptable it would more than likely have somewhat melted into the muffin rather than being the crumb-like streusel topping I was after. Once I \"fixed\" it (at least to MY liking) all was fine and I had a perfect blueberry streusel muffin.",
