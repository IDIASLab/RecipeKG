My hubby and son liked this but we all thought it was really salty. I even used low-sodium soy sauce. I cannot imagine how salty it would be with Spam (or similar) in it too. I didn't even add any salt (rarely do). For leftovers we nixed the sauce and used Heinz 57 for sauce. It was much better. So I'll make this again but without the sauce. Neither my son nor my husband could tell this had raisens (I used golden ones) and they loved the pickles in it! I'll have to ask my Filipino neighbor how authentic this is.",
