I chilled my Kitchen Aid mixer and beater attachment for an hour or so before whipping the cream. As I was whipping the cream, I gradually added one packet at a time until I'd added them all. This was a wonderful dessert--the kids and I thought it was incredible. I was so tickled that I pulled it off using orzo and Truvia! I can't get over how easy it was. I think I might take one of the other reviewer's suggestions and try using chopped mandarin oranges and maybe a little unsweetened coconut in this dessert next time.",

I have 6 kids and all 6 of them raved. hubby and I prefer the orig. recipe but here are some of the variations we tried. I added some chopped coconut to the second batch and it was pretty good the kids also asked for chopped bananas to go with the coconut. I also tried cooking the rice in coconut milk and using it that way. (That was really good too.) so we had the coconut flavor with out the coconut its self. Also we just used the directions on the bag of rice for how much water to cook the rice in.",
