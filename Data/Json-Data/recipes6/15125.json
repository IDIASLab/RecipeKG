                "reviewBody": "Before I made this dessert I read practically every review written and therefore, made the following changes: used 2 cans of apple pie filling mixed with 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, whipped 8 oz of reduced-fat cream cheese with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon the mixed with the apple pie filling mixture (which I coarsely chopped with a knife and fork), reduced the water to 1/3 cup, added 1 Tbsp. cornstarch to the sauce along with 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I use five tortillas (that's how many mouths I'm feeding) and put the extra filling on top of the enchiladas. I found that even though the sauce looks thin after 3 minutes of cooking it thickens quickly as it sits. I usually put this together ahead of time in a 12x8\" rectangular baking dish (and it just barely fits) and about 1 hour before time for dessert (my family likes to wait a little while after dinner) I pop it into the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes on the top rack. The result is a a thick sweet sauce and yummy crepe-like apple-filled dessert. Make sure to serve warm with vanilla ice cream it really complements this dessert. Anyway thanks for posting:) I've made this twice already and even with my changes it's incredibly easy to make and yummy.",

The only difference i made was: adding a mixture of cream cheese and sugar into the middle of the tortilla before the apples. When we tried it, the cream cheese in it was soooooooo delicous! ive made it WITH and WITHOUT the cream cheese mixture, and its way better with it!! Also make sure to cook the enchiladas for a little longer than usual so that it gets a crispier crust. I highly recommend this!!!",

I have made it with both canned and fresh apples. Fresh apples are much better. I just sliced 4 small granny smith apples into small chunks and mixed them with 1/2 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of flour. Divide the apples between 5 tortillas and sprinkle with cinnamon before rolling them up. I also make this recipe with 1/3 cup of water and bake them at 350 for 40 minutes. The tortillas get nice and crunchy on top. They are great hot out of the oven with ice cream. We even love them the next day even though the tortillas get a little soggy on the bottom.",

To keep the sauce from separating on standing, boil it longer than 3 minutes.  Turn off the heat only after everything has obviously melded and your sugars have broken down.  I made the sauce early in the day and re-heated just before popping in the oven.  I also prepared my enchiladas early in the day and then lay a damp paper towel over top (to keep the tortillas from drying out) and covered with saran wrap. I also baked for at least 40 minutes until they were nice and crispy.  This definitely tastes and presents like it is more work than it is!",

I took the advice from the other reviewers about the filling being bland, so I seasoned the canned apple filling with cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter, and it turned out great.  Like others, I also baked it with pecans on top, and used corn shells for some of them, as I ran out of flour shells.  The corn shells didn't taste as well as the flour, but it was still ok.   The only problem is that it was a little sweet, so next time I will use less sugar for the syrup that goes over the desert.  The flour tortillas didn't even taste like tortilla, but more like a crepe.  We had a Mexican fiesta, and everyone raved about it.  I have more flour tortilla shells, and apple filling, so I will make it again next week.  Thanks ReDonna for a great recipe.",

The tortillas made this dessert a little plain.  It is very easy to put together, but out of 6 of us, none of us liked the end result.  It was also too buttery and I don't think water is needed.  It would have been better gooey instead of runny.  Sorry.",
