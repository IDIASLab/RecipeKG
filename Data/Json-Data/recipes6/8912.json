I changed the recipe to 8 servings as my crockpot was 2.5 quarts instead of 3.5.  Had a hard time telling if the bread was done and over cooked it a little and the bottom edge got very brown.  Will try mixing it up the night before and keeping it in the refridgerator, punching down in the morning, keep refridgerated until my lunch break and put it in the crockpot then to serve for supper.  Thanks for the recipe.  Also, my crockpot doesn't have a bread or cake baking dish, just the removable ceramic insert with glass top.  Worked great!",

                "reviewBody": "Overall, I really enjoyed this bread. It's the perfect whole wheat sandwich bread, with a great texture and flavor. I replaced 1 of the cups of milk with water, since milk is a bit tricky to come by at the moment. With that said, I had some issues with the method of making this. Following the measurements according to this recipe, I had a batter instead of a dough. It was really soupy. I used at least another cup of whole wheat flour before it came together into an actual dough. I also kneaded it for about 10 minutes before resting it, because it was sticky, and I wanted the gluten to form better. I also could not get a loaf pan to fit into my crock pot, so I nixed that. For me, this recipe made enough dough to fill 2 8x4\" loaf pans. There was a lot of dough, and it wouldn't have worked/fit in the slow cooker for me. So I baked the two loaves in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Since I was in a bit of a hurry, my loaves didn't rise as high as I wanted--but that's my fault, not the recipe's. I would make this again, as it's a wonderful bread, but I would alter the method to make it work better for me.",
