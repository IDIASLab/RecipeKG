Also, this recipe isn't very salty, so you might want to add more soy sauce or salt to it so it isn't so bland. This recipe is a good starting point, but it seems to be lacking a lot of spices and flavor.",

I use pork loin roast instead of ribs and - for the rich flavor some reviewers found lacking - I reserve and strain the par-boil water and use it to simmer the recipe. Do not boil longer than 3-5 minutes or it dries out the meat. You want it to simmer in the other flavors until fully cooked. I often substitute the green onion with sweet onion slices, as that's what I have on hand. Use one T. ground ginger if you don't have fresh ginger - it's just as good - and I double the cinnamon. The 1/4 tsp. pepper may be a bit hot for small kids. Both my grown sons, who've never cared for pork, really love this dish. I serve it with Sesame noodles and pea pods as sides, for a great Asian-style meal.",
