I have to admit I'm one who believes that you taste with your eyes first - so instead of following the directions for baking I used my cupcake pans to get the desired 'Tandy Kake' effect. Once they were cooked I removed them from the pan and spread some peanut butter on top of each cake. I melted my chocolate in a double boiler and spread it over the cakes plopping a largish 'blob' on top of the cake. Then I quickly spread the chocolate over the cake to the sides and 'frosted' around the cake to the edges. Be careful not to mess with the top too much if you are going to use this method because the heat of the chocolate melts the peanut butter and it tends to bleed into the chocolate a little bit. Once they were 'frosted' I popped them into the freezer for 3 minutes to 'set' the chocolate. They were MOST excellent! Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe!",

I used a regular size cupcake pan but poured 1 tbs of batter in each and baked for 10 min. I repeated this until all of the batter was gone. I then used honey peanut butter (to add some extra sweetness). Once all tops werebspread with peanut butter inlaced them in the fridge for about an hr. I then melted 2 bags of regular chocolate chips (1 bag at a time) and dipped The top of the cakes (the peanut butter side down) wih the chocolate and placed them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and placed them back into the fridge until hardned. Talk about delicious I thought I was eating an actual tasty cake.",
