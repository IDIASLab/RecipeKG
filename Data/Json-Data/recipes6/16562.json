I used the Keebler mini Graham Cracker Ready Pie Crusts with the same recipe for the 9 inch pie and it filled about 18 of them. I baked them for 60 minutes but that was too long for the graham cracker crusts. I would say try baking them for 45 minutes and see how they're doing and add 5 minutes until they're done. The recipe above was good and I would say you can reduce the sugar just slightly if you don't like things too sweet. I also substituted So Delicious Coconut Milk instead of regular cow milk and it worked grreat. I would make this again and I think I would try a different sweetener like coconut sugar to see how it tastes. We generally don't like super sweet desserts.",
