I think that if I'd stopped after tossing the fruit into the cooked dressing it would've been fine. However the whipped cream made it way too creamy. If you use marshmallows I would advise cutting the amount in half at least. The whipped cream and the marshmallows totally overpowered the fruit. I will try it again just using the cooked dressing and tossing in the fruit.",

I left my family recipe at home so I checked here - I'm sure that there are other names for it but I've always known it as 24 Hour Salad. However mine is a bit different I melt the marshmallows in the egg mix because it helps thicken the salad overall and many people are not fond of the texture of marshmallows. I added a bit more than it calls for as I go by taste. No poppy seeds in mine! I also used a bit more whipping cream as well (maybe a quarter cup extra). Be extra careful when folding in the whipped cream to the rest of it or it can become sloppy. This is a hit every time.",
