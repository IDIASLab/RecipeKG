I could not find it anywhere so I used the Extra Firm Tofu that I had. I cubed the Tofu and then marinated it in an delicious sauce called \"Soyaki\" that I bought from Trader Joe's. I highly recommend this sauce for Tofu fish and stir-fry's. It is a mix between Teryaki and Soy sauce but it is thicker and has ginger and sesame in it. After marinating the Tofu for 15 minutes I sauteed the Tofu in some olive oil and Soyaki sauce for about 25 minutes turning the Tofu to coat both sides. While the Tofu cooked I chopped up some green pepper yellow pepper garlic ginger eggplant carrots 1 vidalia onion and half a jalapeno pepper. I took the Tofu out of the pan when finished and used the same pan with olive oil to sautee about 2 tbps. of Garlic and 2 Tablespoons of fresh grated ginger. After about 5 minutes I added the green and yellow bell pepper and 1 tsp. of minced jalapeno. We like our food on the spicy side! I then added the sweet Vidalia onion and carrots along with a few splashes of soy sauce (as called for) and several more Tbsp. of \"Soyaki\" sauce (instead of teriyaki sauce). Since carrots always take longer to cook I simmered this concoction for about 10 min. before adding the cubed eggplant. Unless you like really sweet food I personally think 3 Tbsp. of honey is too much so I only added 1 Tbsp. and found that it was still very sweet. I",

I used the veggies as indicated plus 1 yellowneck squash a little bit of diced green peppers jalapeno red onion and sliced carrots. Basically I cleaned out the fridge. Marinated the veggies for a little while then sauteed them and let them simmer in the marinade for about an hour. Very good! Thank you!
