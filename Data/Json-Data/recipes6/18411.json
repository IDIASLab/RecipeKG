First:  I added in cinnamon to the flour/sugar/butter mixture (1/2 tsp and could have done more).  Second:  I used buttermilk.  Third:  I added in almond extract to the cake batter part (about 1/2 tsp).  Fourth:  I used more blueberries than called for.  It was divine!  I did have to cook it a touch longer, could have been due to more blueberries, but I don't mind.  It's SO good!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

It was easy, didn't have any complicated ingredients (I had everything in my kitchen and it's not even that well stocked at the moment), and tasted so good. We had it with coffee this morning. I made it for Father's Day breakfast. It had a simple, old-fashioned very slight sweetness, not the sickening sweetness of store-bought blueberry muffins, for example. I did as someone suggested and added a little cinnamon to the topping, but I suspect this would have been just as terrific without that addition. This is one of those recipes I'll grab when I need a tasty dessert for a party, potluck, housewarming, or whatever! Infact, my new neighbor is 9 monthes pregnant and I can't wait until she has the baby so I can rush over with some Blueberry Boy Bait and say Congratulations :) :) :) Thanks so much!",

Take advantage of the short blueberry season for this, no matter how hot it is outside, and use an entire pint box of blueberries.  Really good \"coffee cake\" style product, I only added some Mexican vanilla to the liquid ingredients.  I'm sure this would be good with raspberries or blackberries also.  It was excellent served warm with a scoop of homemade blueberry ice cream, too, but can stand alone just fine.  Thank you, Hannah!  PS:  Best recipe name I've seen!",
