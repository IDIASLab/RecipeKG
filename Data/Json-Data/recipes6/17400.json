I used about 3/4 of a package of Pecan Sandies with 1/4 cup melted butter for the crust, baked that for about 7 minutes then followed the recipe exactly. I set the cake pan on a double layer of foil and wrapped it around the outside, that kept all the butter and/or rhubarb juices in the foil, not all over the oven!  Then I baked it for 45 minutes at 350*,  shut the oven off and left the cheesecake in for another 15 minutes.  \nThe whole family loves it and we will definitely make it again and again!\nThanks for the great recipe!!",

This cheescake was the best of the 3 I made AND I brought all three creations to work and again this cheesecake was rated the best of the three.  I had to make probably 15 copies of this recipe to give out.  It was SUPER easy to make.  I had one minor problem....when I baked the rhubarb mixture for 15 minutes as directed, the liquid created by the rhubard leaked out of my sprinform pan and into my oven and that gooey stuff turned rock hard on the bottom of my oven.  Oh well...the final result was sooooo fantastic, this little mess was well worth it and I'd do it again!!! Thanks!!!",

That was also my first impression when I put it in the pan but I didn't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong. The rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb. As a whole it didn't have that strong rhubarb flavor I was looking for. The sour cream on top was just fine though I was not sure I wanted to add it I'm glad I did. I'd probably make this again adding more rhubarb.",
