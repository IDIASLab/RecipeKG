I like the pineapple in this--gives it a nice sweetness and flavor.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I used a Christmas bread that my godparents send us every year for Christmas.  It's an eggy bread with candied fruit in it, so it was a good combo with the pineapple.  We had it for breakfast this morning with some whipped cream.  Thanks for the recipe!",
