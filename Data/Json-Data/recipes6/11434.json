If I serve it for breakfast I serve it as is sometimes w/ butter. For dessert I make a powder sugar or cream cheese glaze (depends on what I have on hand) and pour on top of it while it is still warm (not hot)- this is my husband's favorite way to eat it. The glaze makes it more of a \"cake\" but still not overly sweet like regular frosted cake. Thank you Sandi for a great recipe!",

My bananas were really ripe if I hadn't it would have been way too sweet. Nice basic banana bread recipe. I got 12 medium sized muffins out of this recipe. 350 for 20 minutes was just right.",
