I used 2 cups of strawberries that I tossed with 2 Tbsp. of sugar and just let them set while I made the batter. For the batter I used 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of white sugar that I creamed together until light and fluffy then added the eggs and 2 tsp. of vanilla. I also used added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder along with the baking soda and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon with the nutmeg. I made these into 6 Texas sized muffins and topped them with turbinado sugar for some extra crunch on top. I baked them at 400 for 25 minutes. They were so moist and full of flavor - I will definitely make these again!",
