The mixed salad greens and fresh herb provided the perfect blend of flavors. I made my own taco salad bowls and served the taco salad in them. Thank you ciheins for a great recipe and and changing my mind on weeds.",

Not sure if we weren't in the mood for taco salad but thought it lacked the punch that a taco salad usually serves. I added diced tomatoes avocado and jalape\u00f1os to the mix. It is good salad and healthier than a beef taco salad so your family should give it a try.",
