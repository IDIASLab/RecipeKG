The powdered sugar on top added a little more sweetness. I was a little concerned when I added the eggs to the butter and sugar as the mixture started to separate and looked more like cottage cheese than creamed butter eggs and sugar. I tried to fold in the flour and cocoa as is advised in so many Madeleine recipes but it took quite a bit of stirring to get the mixture blended. I thought the batter looked like it needed more flour but as you will see it did not. I did as the recipe instructed and placed rounded teaspoons of batter in the Madeleine pans (I used Bakers Joy - two short bursts per mold and blotted any huge globs with a paper towel or brush) and it was exactly the right amount of batter. I preheated my oven and checked the temperature with an oven thermometer. I baked the Madeleines for exactly 12 minutes. I turned the pan over and they popped right out on the rack with a little whack. I wish these were low fat because these are a tasty way to get your daily allotment of heart healty cocoa!",

A day or two later they taste great dunked in coffee. These have become an instant staple in my house. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!",

I also found them to be a little on the bittersweet side which is fine by me but some people do prefer their chocolate goodies to be sweet rather than bitter. Mine turned out a little bit too much like mini muffins as well. I'm not sure whether that's because I over mixed the ingredients although I did fold the dry ingredients in and only just until they were all blended.",
