(i baked it exactly as the recipe said, i didn't lower the temp.) SO READ THIS IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS RECIPE.... WHEN YOUR CAKE IS DONE BAKING AND HAS COOLED........IF YOUR TOPPING IS KINDA RUNNY/GOOEY/NOT CRISPY ENUF FOR YOUR LIKING( you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first) COVER A PAN IN FOIL AND PLACE CAKE ON PAN (topping up) and place cake in oven on BROIL for a few minutes (depending on how crispy you want it) the pineapple will get a little brown also, but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious!",

I followed the recipe as is. I did add a little, too. After I put the brown sugar mix in I sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design. I made two cakes and after they cooled I stacked them. SIMPLY WONDERFUL -  especially the cake's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy. Someone said they didn't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant. When you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so. The egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny.",

I thought the batter was too runny when it went into the oven but the cake turned out great anyway and it kept for several days in the fridge. I had zero problems with this recipe. I never figured out what \"Beat the whites until stiff bu not dry\" meant. The egg whites never got stiff they did get foamy (kinda like soap foam) but never stiff or dry. Oh well. I used canned Dole Pineapple slices 1 can for the pineapple rings (I used 5 rings) and the 3/4 cup of juice. Other substitions: I used margrine instead of butter and I used cheap-o vanilla flavoring rather than vanilla extract. This recipe rocks a perfect Pineapple Upside Down Cake!",

For those of you who had a dense cake, you did not beat the egg whites to medium-stiff to stiff peaks, or did not fold in the egg whites into the egg yolk and flour mixture properly. The way the egg whites are whipped and folded into the batter is the key to the cake's fluffy texture. The cake part is supposed to be the  texture of a chiffon cake, something quite light and fluffy. (As this pineapple cake contains the separate foaming method.) Also, you have to get the egg yolks to a creamy or \"lemony color\" consistency as well.   Pineapple upside down cakes are not supposed to be dense bricks everyone! Fluffy is the key to happiness!",

With my KitchenAid it took about 10 minutes on speed 8. If you have a handheld mixer...it'll be about twice that. If you are using a whisk...heaven help ya, it ain't gonna happen easily.  When folding in --- take 1/3 of the white and mix into the batter, no need to be gentle. It lightens the batter. Then dump in the rest and fold in gently til all incorporated.  Note: you need a deep pan else don't put in all the batter!  Also - put some foil around the bottom curled up to catch brown sugar dribbles :)  YUM!",
