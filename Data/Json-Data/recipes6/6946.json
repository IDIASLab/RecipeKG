Used only about 2 lbs of meat and it was all ground venison. I also added a chopped bell pepper some chopped carrot and some beans to it. The addition of the masa harina was unexpected too. It made the chili thick and added a little bit of corn flavor to it--I really liked it! I really enjoyed this chili; and I almost think it tastes better the next day!",
