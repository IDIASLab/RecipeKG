It was easy to prep (I even prepped the marinade the day before so I could just douse the salmon when I got home to let it marinate while I worked out) and the 2-3 minutes per side cook time was spot on for me. I found myself preferring the heavily glazed bites so I think I'd marinate longer and use even more whole cooking next time. THANKS for the recipe!",

Who would fuss over 2/3 of a TEASPOON  in a sweet marinade with almost no other sweetener? It surely must be 1/3 cup. I did more of it than 1/3 cup, and a bit more honey, but I usually like things such as a maple or sweet and sour-type salmon to be more on the sweet side.",

I probably used 2-3Tbsp honey and 1Tbsp brown sugar (I eyeballed it though) Served over saut\u00e9ed broccoli and carrots and with white rice (forgot I had brown). I made another batch of the sauce recipe so I could toss the veggies with it before spooning over the rice. Yum!",

The glaze is actually a very tasty marinade that I would use again - maybe it had too much soy sauce because it was very wet. I added extra honey to thicken it and it helped a little. Overall this is a very tasty dish and I'm happy that I have a new marinade to use on other meats and possibly even use as a salad dressing. It's that yummy! But this is not sweet glazed salmon it's more of a savory dish so I'm looking forward to trying out other recipes here.",
