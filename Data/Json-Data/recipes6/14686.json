Mine came out less like crepes and more like really thin pancakes but it's not supposed to be as paper thin as a crepe anyway- if you want crepes look up a recipe for crepes and make CREPES but don't make a Swedish Pancake recipe and then be disappointed b/c it's not a crepe! Consider the Swedish Pancake a middle ground between crepes and regular pancakes. To me the batter consistency is PERFECT because they were super easy to flip and I've gotten frustrated with crepes before but these were no more difficult than \"regular\" pancakes and not as heavy to eat. I had mine with a little bit of sour cream and blueberry preserves rolled it up and Mmmmm!!! We made these with Dutch Babies II and although that one was better IMO these were stil 5 s all the way. Seriously if you love pancakes YOU MUST try the Dutch Baby. I might not make \"fluffy\" pancakes for a long time I think I'm more partial to these \"flat\" ones now =) Update: Wanna know the BEST thing ever? these Swedish pancakes with Bluberry preserves and sour cream rolled up inside and then topped with LEMON CURD... OMG!!! A-MA-ZING!!!",
