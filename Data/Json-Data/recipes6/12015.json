The only tip to pass along is to be sure to chop the nuts into smallish pieces, they are much better if they kind of blend into the texture of the cookie rather than stand out. I am so happy to find this recipe. My local bakery sells these for an arm and a leg, and my husband loves, loves, loves these. He loves these cookies so much that he came home from work ate four of them and then helped me with laundry- without me even asking him to help. These cookies have special powers! ",

I had to bake five times in my oven because there were so many! The second time I baked I made them smaller and now they were crisp which I like better. Cutting the cookies didn't work for me so next time I will only cool the dough and roll SMALL balls.(because they spread a lot) Dipping the fork in milk and flatten them works fine as long as you dip after each flattening. From now on I will only use half or a third of the recipe. update: I forgot to put the nuts in and also forgot to dip them with milk and they were delicious!! My daugther keeps asking for another one..and another...",

They came out delicious and my husband and toddler did not want to stop eating them! I'm glad I divided the dough into six rolls and froze some of them. I like making my cookies on the smaller side so 1 roll yielded 10 cookies. Even with them smallish I had to bake them at 10 minutes because I dipped the fork in milk each time I flattened. The cookies were crispy along the edges and a little moist in the center... This oatmeal cookie recipe is a keeper.",

I crumbled the 2nd roll and added 1/2 the flour measurement in small amounts kneaded it and baked the most delicious cookies. This is a very forgiving recipe. I did press on top of each cookies before baking a few larger pieces of walnut. I think that put it a little over the top. The crispy flat first batch was crumbled and saved to sprinkle over puddings cereals etc.",

I made the dough into a roll and stuck in the fridge and found they were falling apart when I went to slice them and put them in the oven.
