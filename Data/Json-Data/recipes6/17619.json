Melt in pan on stove or microwave. Add 3 cups powdered sugar. Mix well by hand. As soon as cake is out of oven poke it all over with a toothpick. Pour the glaze over and it will melt on the cake and dribble down those holes. The top will shine. Cool and cut into bars. This seem to keep forever (if it lasts) when refrigerated.
