They are tender, just the right amount of sweet flavor, and are buttery, even though I didn't use real butter, but instead used margarine, like the recipe called for.Don't soften the margarine before you make them (the recipe DOES NOT say to, but a lot of cookie recipes do, so I just wanted to note that).  Also, to cut down on the stickiness of the dough, I recommend chilling the dough a bit, but not too long (just until it is no longer extremely sticky).  I made one batch before I chilled it, and more after and the batch before the chilling spread out more and were a little flatter and maintained their chewy centers better.  I would not recommend cooking them for 15 minutes; they will be WAY over done.  I cooked mine for 9-10 min and did not allow them to brown at all.  Then I left them on the cookie sheet before taking them off to finish cooking a little more. I recommend these highly and will make them again!  I especially liked that they did not need to be rolled...who has time for that?",

I always use soften butter to make the cookies-the taste is incredible.  When I double the recipe, I usually add 1-2 extra tbsp of flour (depending on the humidity). Also, I have found that chilling the dough for 1-2 hours, or even overnight, prevents the cookies from flattening out.  Clients really like when the cookies are rolled in a sugar/cinnamon combo--very yummmy.",

As promised the cookies turned out crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. If you are looking for a \"all-over\" chewy cookie (not crisp at all and more soft) then this recipe is NOT for you. Also if you are looking for a sugar cookie to roll and cut-out this may not be the recipe. The dough is awfully sticky. I did change a couple of things: I used butter instead of margarine and after the first batch I quit rolling them in the sugar (it was too sweet for me!) Otherwise the cookies turned out deliciously buttery and the texture is still the same on the second day. Good tips from others: if the dough is too sticky to handle refrigerate it. My only beef is that the cookies are fairly thin; this recipe would be even better with if it produced a super thick chewy crispy sugar cookie.",

These are nice and soft. Make sure you don't cook them too long, they are done when you just start to see a little color, kind of a yellowish color, but very slight, don't worry they will harden! The dough and the cookies themselves taste kind of like the Break 'n Bake that you can buy in the grocery stores! So, thanks so much, Cindy!\r\nIt's been a couple of weeks since I posted the above statements--I made both this recipe and Cracked sugar cookies I and compared them. I took one bite of one and then one bite of the other--this is definently the best sugar cookie recipe I have EVER tasted. There is no lack of flavor, these are so awesome! They look good, taste good. You don't even need frosting. They kind of remind me of Sugar Cookies that you can buy at Subway. I just want to encourage anyone looking for a chewy, soft, yummy sugar cookie to TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!! \r\nI give these ************************* 25 stars!!!! I wonder what they would be like with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts???? I might try that...if I do, I'll let you know...",
