I did not add the elbow pasta I cook it separate from the soup and add it to the bowl then add the soup. The aroma of this cooking was wonderful and made my kitchen smell so very good. Reminded me of my mom s kitchen growing up..I did not add the cheese(dietary issues) Will definitely make this again. Thank you Buckwheat Queen for this delicious recipe. November 18/ 2018",
