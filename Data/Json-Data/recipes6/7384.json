Splenda in dough and 2 Tbls. in raisin/nut mixture. I divided the dough wrapped in Glad Wrap and chilled. It was very easy to get the 16 triangles and they practically rolled themselves! I rolled each 1/4 of dough between sheets of waxed paper. When I had each round the right size I carefully peeled back the wax paper dusted with flour layed each round on cookie sheet and chilled for about 10 minutes before I layered fruit and nut mixture. I too brushed each with fruit spread just as they came out of the oven. It's nice because I prepared raisins/nuts mixture put in plastic bag; then later stirred up dough and chilled it; then later on I made the cookies. This makes it seem less labor intensive. Thanks for this recipe. It is the greatest!",

Instead of margarine, I used 1/2 stick butter and 1/2 cup applesauce then added milled flaxseed for the pastry.***UPDATE*** I made this again but I didn't have cream cheese.  I used sour cream and plain yogurt with a bit more flour, I had to bake it twice as long and it still came out awesome!!  This is my favorite recipe, I will make this more often, maybe fill it with other things like tomatoes and mozzarella. ",

However don't eat this if you are a diabetic nor prepare it for someone who is a diabetic. There are way too many carbs in it for the diabetic. Carbs turn to sugar. Even if you substitute whole wheat flour there will be a problem with carbs. So many diabetics think that if something doesn't have sugar they can eat it but if there is flour in it you can't.
