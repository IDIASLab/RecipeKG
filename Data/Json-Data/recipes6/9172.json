        "description": "Every spring I do a crawfish boil and every year I think there has got to be an easier way. It takes 30 minutes to get the stockpot full of water to come to a boil and then the crawfish require 30 minutes of soaking, which results in overcooked potatoes and corn. This year I was determined to simplify the process and set out looking for an Instant Pot&reg; method online. There were plenty of recipes that called for frozen crawfish but I couldn't find one single one that used live crawfish. Challenge accepted!",
