One downside, it definitely needs something for sweet pies, it is a very savory crust as is.  I usually add 3 - 4 tablespoons of sugar, or add honey in addition to the sugar.  If I prebake it, for things like pudding pies, I even sprinkle some white sugar over the top to bake in during the 10 minutes.   I made one mistake when I used it for my pumpkin pie(I baked the crust first, then added the pumpkin), but I just made another pumpkin pie('tis the season), without prebaking it,  and the crust was PERFECT.  If you double the recipe, it even works for making a 9x13 pie(I feed a LOT of people at times).  Thank you for a recipe that always pleases, and always gets asked for.  Probably will never stop using this...lol.",

UPDATE: I am changing my rating to a 5 star - which I do not give out very often.  I have made this crust MANY times now and I get raves EVERY SINGLE TIME.  So, this pie crust deserves 5 stars based on taste and texture alone - not to mention simplicity!",

This will be the only pie crust recipe I will ever turn to. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. \nUpdate: I use this recipe all the time for pies and quiche, and even some cream soups. It is great with Cream of Carrot soup, Chicken Pot Pie soup or any type of tomato soup. Each time I serve it to guests, they want the recipe. Even my mother wanted it. This is the best for people that avoid butter, margarine and shortening. If you use canola oil, that is much healthier for you. I always make this for a serving of 10, it gives a nice thick crust. ",

I used this for a lemon meringue pie. will make again but using less oil and perhaps some sugar or some sort or splenda. would definitely be better 'as is' for a savory pie rather than sweet.",
