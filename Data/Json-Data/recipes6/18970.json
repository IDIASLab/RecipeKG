I didn't even want to see another cookie by this point!  But the smell was lovely and the taste amazing.  This is THE shortbread.  There is none better.\nI did roll the dough into a log and after refrigerating for several hours I sliced into cookies.  Much easier than rolling out and cutting with a cookie cutter. I also used about 1 1/2 tbsp of almond extract for a little bolder almond flavor. This is a super simple recipe to make.",

I don't think it needs frosting at all as long as you really turn up the extract. I will make these again and Im not the biggest fan of baking.",

I used the glaze recipe suggested by one reviewer (Linda I believe) and they were close to the Voortman Almonette cookies that my husband loves. In the future I'm going to roll dough into log in wax paper and then put in fridge. The dough is very hard when coming out of fridge making it very difficult to 'drop by teaspoonfuls' so I'm going to treat as an icebox cookie. That way you can slice the dough into circles instead of using the bottom of a glass to squash. It'll save time that way.",
