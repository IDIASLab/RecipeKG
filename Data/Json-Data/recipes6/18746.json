Like previous reviews have said this is basically Sloppy Joes with a bit of a tang. I only had small hamburger buns so this made 8 buns' worth plus a few more spoonfuls. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it came out pretty saucy. (The main picture on the recipe page seems to show it as being a lot drier.) If I made this again I probably would cook it longer in order to get rid of a lot of liquid in the sauce. The sauce was pretty sweet to me maybe a little too sweet. Also celery is one of my least favorite vegetables (I find it boring and tasteless not awful). Since I'd never really cooked with it I thought I'd made a mistake when I brought \"Celery Hearts\" home but then I learned that they're just the innermost ribs of the celery so they were probably okay for this recipe. I was surprised that all the cooking left the chopped celery still crunchy. I'd personally skip that ingredient next time.",
