I knew from looking at the recipe beforehand that 2 tbsps of red pepper flakes would make this inedible--so only used 1 tsp and that was still plenty enough heat for us. I also made this in my pressure cooker to cut the time in half. I sauteed everything added the ingredients cooked it in the pressure cooker for about 30 minutes then uncovered it added in the masa harina and simmered until thickened. I think it's much faster and more straight-forward that way. It's a great chili and like most tastes better the next day. I served it topped with some chopped green onions and some cheddar cheese. I would make it again. But my advice is to make sure to adjust the seasonings to your taste and be aware of the heat-factor.",
