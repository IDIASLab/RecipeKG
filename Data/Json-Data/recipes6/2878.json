I added the whole 3 T of oil, and in combination with all the sugar, it was a sticky, oily mess. After 10 minutes, I took them all off the pan and put them on a new pan with parchment paper. I cooked for a total of 45 minutes to get as crispy as I wanted. I added some salt with the mixture, and the cinnamon and curry flavor combo is fantastic.",
