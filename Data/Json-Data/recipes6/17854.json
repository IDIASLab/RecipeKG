                "reviewBody": "This is better than pre-packaged mixes. Omit the flour in the mix. If you'd like to thicken your chili, use refried beans instead--no one will notice-I promise! Use 1/4 cup at a time until it's as thick as you'd like it. Use the seasoning mix as follows: for a small batch of chili use 2T of mix with 1 lb meat of choice, any other veg additions and 1 can of drained/rinsed beans (or about 6-8 oz dry beans, cooked), 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can reg sized can tomato sauce. For a bigger batch use about 4T of mix with 2 lbs meat, 1 pound of dry beans (cooked) or about 3 cans rinsed/drained beans, 2 cans reg sized tomato sauce, 1 (or 2) cans diced tomatoes, and some water if you'd like to thin it. This is only to give others an idea of how much mix for the beans/meat/tomato ratio. It's very forgiving. This makes a very very good plain ole fashioned no frills chili. Also, if you want this just warm...decrease pepper flakes to 1 tsp--it's still plenty warm for those who don't like it hot (like me!). I did jump up the chili powder amount to 2 level TB instead of 4 tsp. This is a well-rounded mix--I was not left with that..'there's just something missing' feeling. It was ALL there! Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
