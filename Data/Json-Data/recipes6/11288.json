For this recipe I will ALWAYS use this exchange of wheat flour because both flavor and texture are SO much better! White sugar & brown sugar 1/2 cup each. Baked in 10\" tube pan about 45 minutes. Sprinkled powdered sugar on top rather than ice it. I cut a slice posting a photo to show how it looks. The only \"after taste\" is a good flavor -- and not too sweet since I cut back sugar. Will add a bit more cinnamon next time. This does NOT taste like \"corn bread!\" I don't know how anyone could say that.",

The cake did turn out moist - however it took me 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe directed. Could be 'cause I used a glass baking pan instead of Metal/Cast Iron. Overall I would probably give this recipe 3 1/2 stars but it only allows me three. It's a decent cake but not incredibly good.
