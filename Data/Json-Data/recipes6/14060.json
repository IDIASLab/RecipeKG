Also I layered as follows: graham cracker crumbs banana slices 1/2 of the pudding mixture a layer of vanilla wafers the other 1/2 of pudding mixture another banana slice layer then the whipped topping. I used more bananas than the recipe called for because my family loves them! My husband said it's his new favorite dessert!",

I couldn't understand why the whole mess was not going according to the directions until I read one of the reviews.  Because I was already \"too late\" in the process, I ended up putting the whole pudding mixture in the blender to get it to actually break apart and congeal.  Even then it was runny and I had to let it set a bit before pouring it over the crust and bananas...and then I had to let it set a bit more before adding the next layer of bananas.  Could've been prevented if the directions had been a little more clear for those of us not accustomed to using cream cheese in such a way.  But now it looks great and from what I've sampled, it tastes great too!  Still I wanted to START my review with the cream cheese alert so that if you are just glancing over the reviews, hopefully it will catch your attention! :)",

As for the reviewers that had problems with the cream cheese becoming creamy.. always bring your cream cheese to room temp when making a recipe or pop it in the microwave on defrost for a minute or two if your in a hurry. Thanks Kathy for the awesome recipe!",

I used a prebaked (homemade) pie shell in place of the graham cracker crust but followed the recipe for the filling exactly. What I got was a banana pudding pie. I might try to use one package of vanilla pudding and one of the banana instead of the two and I may add more cream cheese. By the way my cream cheese didn't mix into the batter too well (and I used a kitchenaid mixer) and I was a little concerned about it's appearance but once it chilled overnight it seemed fine. I also made homemade whipped cream instead of the cool whip stuff - so that helped with the taste.",
