INSTEAD OF 3 CUPS OF FLOUR I USED 2 CUPS OF FLOUR AND 1 CUP OF OATS. I PRESSED DOWN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLOUR/OAT MIXTURE INTO THE BOTTOM OF A GREASED 9\" X 9\" PAN AND USED A MIXTURE OF HALF ORANGE MARMALADE AND APRICOT PRESERVES. WITH THE REMAINING FLOUR MIXTURE I DROPPEED TEASPOONS OF THE DOUGH ONTO THE FRUIT LAYER. THIS WAY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ROLLING OUT THE DOUGH IT FILLS IN AS IT BAKES. I BAKED IT FOR 30 MINUTES AND WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE OVEN I DID A VERY LIGHT DUSTING OF CINNAMON SUGAR. WHEN COMPLETELY COOLED I SIFTED A FINE DUSTING OF CONFECTIONERS SUGER ON TOP. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP THOSE WHO WERE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE TOP LAYER. I BAKE EVERYDAY AND SEND THE \"GOODIES\" OFF TO WORK WITH MY HUSBAND. IN THE EVENING I ALWAYS ASK HOW THEY WENT OVER AND TO THESE THE ANSWER WAS \"GREAT\".",

I have made it twice.  I eliminated the spices for the second batch because I couldn't taste the marmalade.  Very good recipe.  It would be good with any flavor preserves.  Oh, and don't cut back on the marmalade; the moisture is needed.  Thanks Allrecipes!",

Both were great! I think it would also be good with apricot jam, raspberry, or peach--though I think the orange marmalade was my favorite. As mentioned in an earlier review, the dough is a little stiff and hard to spread. So I rolled out each layer of dough with my rolling pin a bit to make it work.",

I made minor adjustments--used 1 cup of flour and 0.5 cup of instant oats, and grated whole cloves instead of ground cloves--and the bars turned out nicely. I think I might omit the cloves next time, or just use less. The almond flavouring in the crust is very nice. Unlike some other reviewers' experiences, I did not find the dough hard to manage; I just pressed the bottom layer firmly in the bottom of the dish and crumbled the remaining mixture for the top layer to evenly cover most of the marmalade (there were some gaps). Then, I pressed down lightly on top with a spatula. In the oven, the top layer spread out and covered the marmalade completely. By the way, the bars do go very well with coffee.",

The recipe didn't make for much dough in order to correctly fill my brownie pan I needed to make a double batch. Then when the whole thing came out of the oven it fell and was pretty mushy on the bottom. Not very easy to cut and serve. The flavor of the marmelade goes well with the cookie-style dough; I think the recipe needs to work though to make the final product easier to handle.",
