Also, I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the peaches and their juice. Baked it at 350 for 1 hour uncovered and it browned nicely. If you are looking for a crispy topping, this will not be the recipe for you, rather the cobbler reminded me of a warm and gooey pie inside! It was excellent with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream and/or whipped  cream! So easy to prepare and of course- to eat! Thanks for the recipe - this will be a repeat recipe for our family.

Let me share with you my favorite peach cobbler recipe so far this summer: melt one stick of butter in an 8 x 8 pan, mix 1 tsp of lemon juice with 1 cup of sugar and about 4 cups of peeled, pitted sliced peaches (5 peaches) together; put this mixture on top of melted butter. Sprinkle cinnamon to suit your taste over top. Then mix together 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of milk. Place this topping all over the top of the peaches. Do not stir. Let bake at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes. Enjoy!",

By then end of baking the milk mixture rises to the top and makes an awesome topping.",

I used the 29 ounce can of peaches instead of the smaller can (the 15 ounce can just wouldn't be near enough fruit for me!). I used about half of the juice. I also added 1 tsp vanilla flavoring 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. And like some of the other users I had to eventually up the temperature to 400 degrees and cook a few more minutes. Next time I think I'll try 1/8 tsp nutmeg and use just a little more juice from the can. Serve this up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! A very tasty dessert!",
