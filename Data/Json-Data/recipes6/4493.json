I also add some garlic ginger and chili mix I buy in jars from the grocery store. I always double the batch and freeze half of it. Lovely to look forward to on a chilly fall or winter evening.",

I peeled my tomatoes and did NOT core them. I put the zucchini tomatoes garlic onion and chili pepper in a roasting pan(covered in olive oil ) and roasted at 425 for about an hour turning them a couple of times. Roasted veggies are so much more flavorful. When they were done I transfered them to the food processor and pureed. I then put them in my \"soup pot\" on the stove and added my herbs. I added the vegetable broth not using as much as the recipe called for. This is a wonderful fresh soup that can be served rustic or very elegant to guests. Thanks to Susandon for posting!",
