Only she used BBQ sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce, and added she didn't precook the bacon, but laid the raw  bacon strips on top the beans and let them cook in the oven. The trouble with that, obviously, is everyone would fight over who got the bacon! :P After while, she would cut the bacon into pieces so everyone got a bit of bacon. Then one time, she was making her baked beans and realized she had no bacon, so she tried substituting the bacon with slices of Hillshire Farm Polska Kielbasa... everyone loved it more than the bacon! So that became her new recipe, and every function she made it at, church potlucks, family get-togethers with her side of the family, dad's side of the family or with my sisters... there was never any leftovers!!!",
