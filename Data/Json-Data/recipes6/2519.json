If you do not have all the spice rub ingredients, just get creative and use what you have. It will still turn out great. It is always a party-favorite. Enjoy.",

I had all the ingredients and mixed them all together. I then made sure I rubbed the pork really really well with the seasoning.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of water. I seared the pork in the pan just like the recipe says. That gave the outside a really good \"crust\" of seasonings. After six hours on high in my slow cooker it just fell apart. We are going to use it for carnitas and for pulled pork sandwiches for the week of work lunches. I highly recommend this! Very,very tasty!!!",

I'm not a big fan of meat cooked in the crockpot but it is too cold to bust out the smoker right now. I really want to try this rub on some ribs once the weather gets warmer. Overall easy and good recipe and one I'd make again.",

The flavor was very good, but a little mild for me in round one, so the second time I put the rub on and wrapped it overnight before searing and putting it in the slow cooker in the morning. I also pulled it apart and let it sit on warm for about two hours after the 6 hours on low. Perfection!! Also, to make it more healthy, I used a pork tenderloin each time and LOVED it.
