If you want to make this recipe as is, just work milk powder into the soft dough by kneading until it is solid enough to hold a ball shape without flattening. Do divide the dough into 20 balls even though they seem small. They are very rich! Also, let your oil cool a bit before adding the second batch by removing it from the heat for a few min. It is important to make the syrup in a large fry pan so there is room for all your little donuts to soak. Cheers!",

After adding what felt like a ton more powdered milk (as recommended by another reviewer) I added more flour and it set perfectly but DO NOT DO THIS. The balls came out beautifully shaped but tasted like rose water bisquick pancakes lol. I recommend slowly adding nearly double the powdered milk called for and testing the dough frequently until it becomes manageable. Also to make galub jamun the traditional size (so they stay moist) your dough balls need to be the size of ping pong balls regardless of how many you produce. Best of luck!",

After resting on the counter for 20 minutes the dough felt almost like rubber and I was concerned but it turned out great! I also added two cinnamon sticks and a pinch of ground cinnamon to the syrup. Also when you first drop the dough balls into the hot oil they will stick to the bottom - I used a wooden spoon to get them off the bottom and they floated pretty quickly. Just move them around for a few minutes and then follow the recipe until the end. I expected these to be mediocre and they were AMAZING. (note: I didn't add any of the optional ingredients).",

I changed a few things. Instead of the all purpose flour and the baking powder I used a half cup of bisquick. Also instead of adding all the milk at once I suggest adding it a little at a time until a medium hard consistency is created. I then separated the sticky dough into about 18-20 sections. I covered it with a slightly damp kitchen towel and let it sit for about an hour. After about an hour I was able to roll the dough into little balls without much problem. The key is not to add a lot of milk and to let it sit in order to form the small balls. I then followed the rest of the recipe as stated. The syrup makes them a bit sweet but not too bad. I received positive comments on this dessert so I will probably try making them again.",
