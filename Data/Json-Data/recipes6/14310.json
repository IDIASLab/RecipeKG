You can certainly create a lower fat version by using lite cream cheese, fat free vanilla wafers and lite cherry pie filling. I have used blueberry and strawberry pie filling as toppings too, however the cherry remains the most popular. It's a very nice presentation to do a variety of toppings however, and there are endless possibilities. One tip I have is to make a day ahead of time and refrigerate overnight (without any topping) and then add the cherry pie filling after thoroughly chilled. Just seems to work better and it is easier for you (or your guests) to remove the muffin paper. I don't add sweet cream cheese or whipped cream to the top, they are flavorful and PLENTY sweet enough as is. Love that this is a nice individual serving, sure to get rave reviews ~",

I made over 100 of these for a benefit and they were eaten quickly. I used 1/2 package of graham crackers for the crumb mixture and used 1 rounded tbs. of crumbs in the bottom of the paper liners. I also sprayed the liners lightly for easy removal. Then, topped half with cherry pie filling and half with semi sweet melted chocolate. If you want to serve individual cakes, use larger muffin tins, skip the crumbs and freeze the cakes until serving. The paper peels off the frozen cakes easily. I did bake about 8 minutes longer the suggested time. When they start to crack open on top, they are done.",

I have not read thru all the reviews but I have a few alternatives that I have tried with much success. First I never use lemon juice, I substitute vanilla instead. Add 1/4 cup cocoa to the mixture and use crushed up oreos for the base then top with 3 white and milk swirled choc. chips when they come out of the oven, so cute and satisfied the chocolate lovers in the family. I have also baked the fruit filling right in the mix because I made these for cookie trays for people at work and was worried about them tipping over and making a mess. One more, use ginger snaps as a base add 1/4 cup of pumpkin, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice ( or equivelent) and top with small dolops of whipped cream.",

After they cool, I brush the tops with a little more Irish Cream, and no one can get enough! Of course, the fruit topped minis are lovely, as well, made according to directions.  They can be made chocolate by sprinkling the bottoms of the papers with crushed Oreos, eliminating the lemon juice and stirring 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips and 1/4 tsp vanilla into the filling. To dress those up even further, I have been known to top the Oreo crumbs with 1 tsp hot fudge sauce, then pour the topping in. Also lovely is a grasshopper version, using the Oreo crumbs, and in place of the lemon juice, add 2 Tb green creme de menthe and 1 Tb creme de cacao. I will sometimes even fold mini chocolate chips into this one. The possibilities are literally limitless. Simple to make, even simpler to eat! These freeze like champs. A+++",
