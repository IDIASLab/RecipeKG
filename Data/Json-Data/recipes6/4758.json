Couldn't find the correct pasta, so used salad macaroni which worked fine.  One note:  10 minutes at medium high heat was much too much for the onion and garlic (the mixture started to brown after 5 minutes at medium, at which point I proceeded with the rest of the recipe).  Healthy and very tasty!",

I made as written except that I waited until the last five minutes to drop my zucchini in because I like it crisp. The next time I make this I will wait to put the peas and green beans in then too but that is just a personal preference. I find this works better for me when the leftovers are reheated as well. All the veggies hold their bright green color that way. This one is a keeper!",
