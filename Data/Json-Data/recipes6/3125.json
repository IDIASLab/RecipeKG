After reading comments I grated lemon peel and skipped water and used lemon juice. Also added cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Alas, I found them a little dull too. I do agree they need more sugar. So I sprinkled some on the tops of others. I needed much more time for mine to cook.  Not sure if it was bc of changes or my oven. I would make them again. Just need a bit more sweetness.",
