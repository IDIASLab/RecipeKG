So many salads are forgettable but this one stands out; everyone loved it. For maximum dresing flavor be sure to drain the artichoke hearts really well. I placed each piece upside down on a paper towel and pressed down lightly to remove as much liquid as possible. I also added some mozzarella fresca (fresh marinated mozzarella balls) just before serving. This one gets a rave review from my family!",

I made a few changes as suggested by previous reviews.  I used olive oil instead of canola, added more veggies (and definitely more garlic), marinated the carrots and black olives with the artichokes, added gourmet mozzarella cut into bite size pieces and put more grated Romano cheese on top of the salad when serving.  I wasn't too sure about \"chopping\" the lettuce, so, I just tore it into bite size pieces. I am making it again today (one week later) and will add more artichokes. This is definitely a recipe I will keep, but with the changes.",

                "reviewBody": "Very Nice! For those wondering about tarragon vinegar Heinz makes a very popular brand. But if you can't find it you can make your own but it can take between 2 and 3 weeks. Recipes can be found for it if you Google it. I don't think It'd be as good with plain vinegar. To up the spiciness that everyone said it lacked I did add about a 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to just the oil 4 days before putting together the salad. It certainly added to the \"spiciness\" and it has one heck of a kick! I probably could have gotten away with just 1/4 tsp or letting it sit for fewer days. I will do that again when I make it the next time! I also added Yancy's Peppadew cheese (a local mildly spicy sweet pepper cheese) mozzarella and capocollo ham. We did leave out the carrots because we don't care for raw carrots. It might be really good with roasted red peppers and maybe some mushrooms and a couple of shakes of Italian seasoning in it too. Can't wait to taste this after it has sat for a night! I'm hoping this won't get gobbled up tomorrow this is one dish that won't get tossed out; I'd love leftovers of this! WOW! OK.....UPDATE: NOT A GREAT LEFTOVER MEAL!!!! It did taste wonderful that day. This salad doesn't get better as it gets older. if it doesn't get ate the day you add the lettuce you will only ending up tossing it out. So think about how much might get eaten that day because it might just end up being a waste of money!",

I don't care for tarragon vinegar or canola oil and I had a lemon to use so I made my dressing of olive oil fresh lemon juice the fresh thyme dry mustard garlic. salt and pepper following the measurements as directed in the recipe. I did not include the sugar which never appeals to me in a salad dressing. I grilled fresh baby artichokes and skipped the step of marinating them in the dressing. Regardless of insignificant individual modifications to this recipe it is one worth trying.
