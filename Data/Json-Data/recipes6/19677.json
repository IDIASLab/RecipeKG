I followed recipe to the \"T\" and I got a wet mess. I cut them in the pan and took out a few even if they were rolled in sugar they would have been a sticky mess. Plus using the size pain indicated they were only maybe an 1/8th inch thick. And I did come back to a full boil in between each addition and then boiled for a minute after each addition. I'm sorry this just didn't work for me. Perhaps using light corn syrup instead of apple sauce and bringing to a hard ball stage 250-265 degrees might develope something that would work better?",
