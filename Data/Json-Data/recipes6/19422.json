What I learned is: Yes, the texture should be like a pancake (so I did have to add more water to mine because it was thick) BUT in addition, once it's put on the cookie sheet, it should NOT be like a pancake but more like a crepe. You've reeeally gotta thin it out with a spoon. Too thick and it'll break. You know you've got it thin enough when you pick it up and it feels like you're flinging a piece of rubber around. If it feels like a thin cookie---too thick still.",

Making them less pancakey.Using the back of a spoon to spread them out before cooking gives them more of an even consistency. Bake a little longer till about a forth to a third is golden brown. Fold them in half lightly grab the top and use an edge of a glass or bowl to get the horseshoe shape then put them in a muffin pan to cool. We made two on a pan and rotated the pans. It sounds complex but once you get the motion in order they are so easy. Thank you for the great recipe.",

If you are planning on popping fortunes in these, wait a few seconds to insert the paper, otherwise it will stick to the cookie and your fotune will be 'You will eat a piece of paper and choke.'",

Spread dough out THIN bake 4 minutes flip cookies over bake 30 seconds more. Work really quick and these look just like the real things!",

I thought these would be so difficult but that was not the case. She wanted to make them for a friend who is leaving town. They turned out so nice!!! We only did 4 at a time to ensure time to fold before they started to crack. We let them get good and brown on the edges folded then placed in a mini-muffin tin to hold the shape. Just wonderful and tasted so much better than store bought. Thanks Babycakes!",

I also added water to make it thinner. It was much easier to spread. Try to get the middle as thin as possible as it tends to be cake-like and breaks apart or cracks pretty easily. I found that I had much more time to shape them then I thought I would and could make four at a time. You might need a towel to shape them as they stay very hot for awhile. I also must have made them larger then intended because the recipe only made 20. I'll be making these again!",
