I made the dressing a day in advance to make sure there was plenty of time for the sugar to break down the mayonaise.  Also, I found that it's much cheaper to buy sesame oil and sesame seeds at an Asian food store rather than the grocery store.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I sprinkled the chicken with a pre-made Schezuan spice mix before pan frying. I thought the dressing was too heavy with mayonnaise so I cut the mayo to 2/3 cup and increased the sesame oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I added sliced celery mushrooms and almonds and garnished the salad with sesame seeds more almonds and crispy chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles. Mix in the dressing a little at a time so you don't put in too much and overwhelm the taste of the veggies. Interesting recipe a great mix of flavors and very filling.",
