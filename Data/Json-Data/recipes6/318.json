The only real changes I made were to use ALL the vegetables I had (onions, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, and a green bell pepper.)  Other than that, I had to use all fish sauce since I was fresh out of oyster.  I also used fresh garlic, sauteed with the veggies, instead of garlic powder.  I'm fairly sad I was out of eggs, because I think they would be a great addition to this dish.  Luckily, I have plans to make it again, so I'll let ya know!  This was great and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch...if they make it that long.",

I used a variety of vegetables, basically what I found in the fridge: red bell pepper, zucchini, onion, broccoli and bean sprouts, but a recipe like this isn't fussy.  Use whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand or what you prefer.  I didn't use the garlic powder, since fresh was superior and already called for.  I didn't use ginger because I'm not a fan of it,  nor sugar because I didn't see the need for it, let alone as much as directed. The fish, soy and oyster sauces are integral to the recipe in my opinion, and should not be omitted. (My photo may look \"off\" because I used those fake noodles you find in the produce department, good for the most part because you save a ton of carbs and \ncalories)",
