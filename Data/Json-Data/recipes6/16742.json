Glaze: 1 cup of sugar 1/2 cup water 2 Tbsp. Butter 1 tsp. coconut flavoring For Glaze combine sugar water and butter; bring to a boil. Add coconut flavoring. Pour hot glaze over top of loaves while still they are still warm. Let sit in pans 4 hours before removing. Also the oven temp should be 325 degrees. This recipe does make 2 regular loaf pans(bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes) or 3 small loaf pans (bake 55 to 60 minutes) and a bundt pan will hold this recipe. We just love this bread toasted and buttered.",

It turns out very well by replacing the 1 c oil with 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce or by omitting the oil all together and using 1 c applesauce (unsweetened). It's a chewier texture but very good if you're looking to cut some calories.",

I baked the loaves for the stated time and temperature and the middle of the loaves were very raw...ended up baking it for another half hour. Crust was burned but the center was salvagable. I will try this just one more time before admitting defeat. UPDATE I made this once more and was disappointed again. Tasty but other recipes are easier.",

Most muffin recipes that fit into my \"Texas\" pan call for 2 cups of flour so this kooky cook made 2/3 of your recipe. They were delicious. I thought these muffins would rise high so I used Pam sprayed \"skirts\" to rest on top of each muffin hole. By skirts I mean old canned tuna or pineapple tins that I've removed both sides of the lids and use just for muffins. Superb chewy dense textured muffins with a big cocoanut flavor. Keep on cooking and posting Susan! Best wishes Jeff",

I baked them at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes. I plan to freeze them til the reunion and and then put a light coconut glaze on them. They were very easy to make and didn't take up alot of time. (If some of you didn't know there is a product on the market called Cultured Buttermilk Blend put out by Saco so you can make just the amount of buttermilk you need instead of having to buy a whole quart of fresh buttermilk) Thanks for the recipe Susan...I'm sure I'll be making these little gems often.",

I noticed the edges getting way too brown about half way through cooking and bumped the oven down to 350. Keeping the oven at 350 for the whole time would make for better bread I think. My boyfriend is from Guatemala and keeps talking about coconut bread. It's excellent toasted with melted butter for breakfast. Would definitely make it again.",
