I am not very good at rolling out pie crust to begin with and do have some problems getting this monster crust on this but I have solved the problem by making a little extra dough so I don't have to roll it out so thin. I also add about a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg and a dash of cloves for a little extra flavor. There is way too much frosting for my taste so I cut the frosting in half drizzle it and then add a few sprinkels of cinnamon sugar before the frosting sets.",

I ended up putting the crust in a smaller cake pan. Also I had special ordered from back East spy apples as in my experience this is the best apple for baking. However it seems they cook up faster than others as in 50 minutes my apples were too mushy. So would I make this again. I just don't have the energy and a basic apple pie is faster. I did substitute some lemon juice to add to the xxxx sugar and I think that's preferable to the vanilla. Adds a hint of tartness. Good luck to everyone who tries this pie.",
