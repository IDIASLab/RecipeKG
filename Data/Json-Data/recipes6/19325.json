With that said this was quite worth the time and the ingredients to make - it turned out extremely rich and flavorful. I did not use \"standard\" American butter cookies for this dish however as the holes in the center wouldn't have allowed them to lay properly in the pan. You will need European style cookies for this - they are square. I used a brand called LU Petit Beurre - it can be found in any large-scale supermarket. The rest of the recipe I did \"as normal\" and it worked perfectly fine. Very rich and delicious indeed. It's well worth trying. Just watch the booze!!!!",

At first I put six cookies on the pan bottom and stood others around the pan's edge. But I could then see the dessert would be less than an inch deep in the center with the tall rim of cookies so I removed those around the edge and used them as more layers. Still I didn't have as many layers as pictured. I have to take this to a gourmet club's Oktoberfest dinner tomorrow.",
