This is definitely chewy due to the coconut which adds to the pleasure of eating this. I recommend 1.5C of coconut 3/4C butter (the 2 extra T isn't necessary) 1/2C of pecans (they're softer than walnuts which is why I wouldn't substitute) and I used a medium scoop which produced 30 cookies at 10 min. I am not sure why some users had trouble with the oven temperature because it's perfect. I'm thinking they cooked a lot longer or made teeny weeny sized cookies.",

I used a little less butter 1.5 cups of the coconut pecans and chocolate chips and I used glazed pecans instead of regular ones. They were an instant favourite! I got 39 cookies out of it. I actually made them again a couple days ago. I cut out a little more butter added more fillings this time. They're still really good but I think I preferred the 1.5 cup fillings more. Cutting out butter doesn't affect the greatness for me. I made them slightly bigger and got 36 cookies. For me for my oven 8 minutes is PERFECT. Just lightly golden brown on the bottom tiny bit of goldenness on the top soft moist and chewy.",
