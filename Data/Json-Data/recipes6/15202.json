Rather than a can of stewed tomatoes, I used a can of diced, seasoned with basil, garlic, and oregano.  Doubled the tomato sauce because I just wanted to use the whole can.  I'm glad I did, because even with the extra tomato sauce I couldn't use all of the pasta I cooked, it would have been too dry.  I guess I used about 2/3 of the 16 oz box that I cooked.  No big deal there.  I also cooked chopped onion with the turkey.  As the sauce cooked, I sprinkled all kinds of spices in...it was a bit bland for our tastes without it.  I added seasoned salt, paprika, red pepper, italian seasoning, extra basil, and a bunch of chili powder.  So, so good, I've been thinking about the leftovers all evening.  Not a fancy meal, but wonderful and filling.  Thank You!  (Would have been great with a salad, as suggested)",

To rev up this recipe I added 1/4 chopped white onion, 1/4 chopped green pepper, 1-2 chopped cloves garlic and 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper to the ground turkey before browning.  This ensures the flavors will get cooked into the meat.  I stuck to the original recipe to finish out the dish, but added more basil than suggested.  This is a regular in our house now.",

I added some paprika, chilli powder and italian seasonings along with some salt and pepper. I also ended up using a whole 10 oz can of tomato sauce which is more than 1 cup(what the recipe calls for).  I finished off the leftovers for lunch this afternoon and it tasted just as good as it did last night for dinner. Thanks I will definately make this again with of course my added spices of preference!!",
