Also I happened to have all the ingredients this recipe calls for. I goofed following the directions since I was trying to hurry. I put the sugar in with the flour etc. and I did not sift but stirred with a wire whisk. I'm glad it still came out good. Also in my oven it only needed to bake 30 min. Even then it looked a little dry but it was very light not at all dry on the inside. It cut beautifully. On my 1st bite of the warm cake I thought it might need to be sweeter but I changed my mind as I finished eating it after all I was enjoying it without icing. I will make this again since it was good easy and forgiving of my mistakes. Also I'm eager to try it with semi-sweet chocolate chips added!",

The photo I submitted is actually this recipe made low sugar using the Splenda brand for baking called \"Splenda Sugar\" it is a blend of Splenda and sugar and is heavy like sugar. I'm a diabetic and it made for a FABULOUS 30th birthday cake for me--everyone swore up and down I bought it.
