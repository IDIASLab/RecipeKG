We also use less sugar (about 1/2C of brown sugar) and I substitute the oil for apple sauce strait across. We usually double and make a pan of 12 muffins and one loaf of bread. The muffins cook in our convection oven for 25 min and the loaf usually 45-50. Love this one and almost have it memorized!",
