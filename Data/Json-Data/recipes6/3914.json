I swapped maple syrup for the brown sugar and used 2 whole eggs in place of the egg whites. I think the only other change I would make next time would be to add a little fat (either oil or melted butter) for flavor and maybe an extra teaspoon of baking powder because I would have liked the bread to rise just a bit more. I also used an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2\" loaf pan and it needed 60 minutes to bake. I would definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!",
