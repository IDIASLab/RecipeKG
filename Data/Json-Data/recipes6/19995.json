As the directions specify: serve immediately! No advance baking on these I'm afraid... UPDATE: some tips on keeping these closed... the less cheese you use the less likely they are to open; use a fork to \"seal\" the edges; time is of the essence when working with puff pastry - don't let the dough dry out! Allow the dough to defrost to the point of being manageable but make sure it stays soft/moist. If you need to let it sit out longer than you expected cover it with seran wrap to keep air out.",
