I sliced the zucchini with a mandolin slicer so it was paper thin, but I think I'll try regular slices next time, for more of an \"apple wedge\" kind of texture. I will also try to use smaller zucchini to avoid some of the seeds, but no one seemed to notice. I microwaved the zucchini for a few minutes and added it hot to the sugar/cinnamon mix.  It does taste just like apple pie (or apple crisp) and I am looking forward to trying it with splenda to make it a little more diet friendly! Thanks for a great recipe Sonya!!",
