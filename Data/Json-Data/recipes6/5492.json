Then added cumin chili powder chili flakes and some chopped jalepeno. And salt and pepper. Added the beans and cooked a little longer. You now have a sort of paste that spreads on the tortillas. Push down a little and it flips perfectly. For those of us who can't use a whole can of beans at once. I cook up a big pot of black beans till just done but firm. Drain. Put them on a cookie sheet and cover with plastic. Freeze. In the morning put them in a big freezer bag a freeze till you need some. You can just grab a handful anytime you need them.",

For instance 1 cup of cheese (if you're making 6) is way too little. Also you'll note that many other reviewers were adding other things. That's because on it's own it lacks character. Next time I'm going to add some jalepenos or crushed red pepper. As far as the frying I don't see why it was necessary. I spritzed the pan with some olive oil before putting the tortilla in the pan and it worked phenomenally well. Nice golden and crunchy. Forget a quarter cup and just squirt some olive oil into the pan before each quesadilla goes in. Like I said a very good start and I will make this again with a number of revisions.",

Also, I love refried beans and salsa, so I added that also, and had a chunky paste to spread on.  Instead of taking the time to assemble these then try to move them, I just assembled them in the pan. I put the tortilla in the heated pan, carefully spread on the filling, sprinkled with cheese, then flipped. Not a bad start, but I think it would be pretty plain without the refried beans.
