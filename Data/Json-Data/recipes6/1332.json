I cut the recipe in half and it made 2 good sized servings. Originally I planned to follow the recipe and cut the brown sugar in half but realized it badly needed the full amount of brown sugar. I bought a seasonal box of crackers that had some almost homemade tasting honey graham crackers. I used those. Whipped cream and honey graham crackers were a good compliment. I just wouldn't put this smoothie in regular rotation due to the added sugar but was different to try. ty",
