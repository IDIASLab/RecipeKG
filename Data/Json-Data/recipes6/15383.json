I knew what they looked like but when I pulled up this recipe I was surprised to see these had a glaze and white chocolate chunks in them. I made them and they are one of the best tasting cookies I have baked in a long time! And oh so cute when I drizzled the glaze over them. They took some time to make but I would say it's worth it. My advice is to try this recipe and you will be delighted. They are soft and tasty. (Oh yes the recipe didn't say how to prepare the pan. I found out you must grease the baking pan or else they will stick. I sprayed mine with cooking oil.)",

However these are a lot of work for sure and I had a bit of a hard time with these at first so I have the following tips: 1. refrigerate the dough so it is easier to handle before you bake the cookies 2. in my opinion the best dough to jam ratio is 1/2 tbsp of dough to 1/2 tsp of jam 3. using my fingers to make the indents didn't work for me so I used the back of the 1/2 teaspoon making sure there is enough dough left at the bottom so the jam doesn't seep through. Give yourself lots of time to make these and then enjoy the delicious result!",
