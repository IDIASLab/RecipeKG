I did have to do a few substitutions based on what I had available to me. The grocery did not have any large flaked oats so I substituted rolled oats; and I also could not find any unsalted pepitas anywhere so I substituted sliced almonds instead. The recipe still turned out great! These cookies do keep their shape exactly how you form them so make sure to flatten them fairly well before you put them in the oven. I got 39 cookies out of this recipe and they were perfectly baked in 13 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",
