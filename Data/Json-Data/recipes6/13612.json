I had a 24 oz container of cottage cheese that was close to the expiration date so I used it all, w/o draining it, 4 eggs separated, decreased the milk to 1c, used 3T. cornstarch instead of flour to keep it gluten free, and 1/2 fresh lemon instead of 1t. I'm guessing my version comes out quite like the original and they are both good. Quick, easy, light dessert........I recommend giving it a try.",
