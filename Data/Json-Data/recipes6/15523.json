I changed the number of servings to 8 and then made a couple of small other changes after reading the reviews and needing to use what I had on hand.  I used butter in place of the margarine, decreased the water to 2 cups, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (and that amount was plenty!), used 3 TBS of cornstarch and added a good dash of cinnamon to the peach mixture.  I also used half and half in place of milk.  These are wonderful! The dough is easy to work with, the recipe if fast to throw together and the combination of flavors and textures is perfect.  My family can not wait for me to make them again. Thanks for sharing!!",
