I'll admit my expectations were very low and I did not expect an eggless cake to be able to compare with normal cakes but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I am so glad I did this cake was better than boxed or any other recipe I've tried. I used this recipe again two nights ago even when I had eggs because it is so easy! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I did have to double the amount of cocoa powder I put into it.",

The texture was great and yes it is moist. Sift the flour then sift all dry ingredients again together. Add viegar last and you will get a nice textured cake but the subtle soap flavour sort of kills it. I would experiment again and see if I can get rid of the soapy taste.",

ADD THE VINEGAR LAST OK TO MIX WITH ELECTRIC HAND MIXER. after it is mixed it very runny(watery)it looked as if it would not rise in oven but it did wonderfully. kids really love this cake..im going to make it again tomorrow. it was fairly easy to make. COMES OUT VERY MOIST. i sprayed the pan with pam....NOT TOO MUCH OHTERWISE THE EDGES GET CRUSTY.",

People now beg me to make cakes for them. Notes: I leave out the cocoa if I want to make a chocolate-free cake no problem. I make a different frosting because I am addicted to cream cheese frosting. And I have found that it rises more if I let it sit in the pan for a few minutes before I put it in the oven. Bottom line: This cake is fail-proof and awesome awesome awesome.",

The only alterations I made were the previously recommended extra 3 tbsp of cocoa I also had no cake flour and used AP; and to my horror I was out of white vinegar. I decided to take the chance and use apple cider vinegar which made no difference (whoo! I was going to eat it anyway)! I also added a capful (about 1/2 tsp) of vanilla to the frosting for extra lil sweetness. After poured the frosting over a still very warm cake it looked so good and I couldn t wait any longer. I sliced a piece and it was like eating the most decadent lava cake from the best restaurant!! I'm super surprised an egg-less cake turned out to be so wonderful; I was excited to try it out! I will most definitely recommend and use this recipe from now on whether or not I have eggs!!",
