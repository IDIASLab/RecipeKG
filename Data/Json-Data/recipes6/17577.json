Based on observations of other reviewers who said this cake was \"dry\" I added a 1/4 c of vegetable oil and also added 1 c of raisins. I cooked this in a bundt pan for 55 minutes. Cake is delightfully moist and full of spicy aroma and flavor. It doesn't need any kind of frosting though I suppose a little powdered sugar would be a nice addition. Thank you for this lovely submission!",

It should be rewrapped after cutting and stored in a cool place or the fridge. We serve it with whipped cream or just by itself.",

I reduced the amount of allspice and cloves. The amount just seemed too much for our preference. I also made my own buttermilk with sour cream apple cider vinegar and a little bit of almond milk. To frost I made a blackberry buttercream by adding blackberry jam to the buttercream I was making. Turned out pretty good - and I will definitely be sharing at the office tomorrow!",
