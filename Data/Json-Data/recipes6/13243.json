The chocolate is much better when it doesn't have to compete with other flavors. 2) I added four egg whites instead of three to the mousse part to make it more airy. 3) I made my own crust out of chocolate graham crackers. 4) I also added gelatin to the topping to stabilize it and I doubled the recipe for the topping because it wasn't enough the first time around. The gelatin creates an almost mousse-like consistency to the topping. Add some chocolate curls to the top of this pie and it will look like it came out of a fancy bakery. With these few changes this pie is perfect.",
