I did kinda make a change to the ingredients ... only because i didnt have any rootbeer. But... i did have \"Not Your Father's Rootbeer\" on hand. I figured we are both over 21, so no harm. I think the rootbeer flavor definitely makes the difference!\nAlso, I dont have an instapot,  I have vintage pressure cookers, so I used my Presto fry pan  pressure cooker and set the weight at 15 lbs. I will certainly make this again. Its my new go to for ribs.\n\nUpdate:  We both liked the flavor so much that I decided to try the same process with chicken.  I cooked both white and dark meat.  I think that the dark meat turned out better as the white meat pieces seemed a little dry.  But, both my husband and I prefer dark meat chicken so that may be the reason for this opinion.  Certainly a very versatile recipe and technique.",
