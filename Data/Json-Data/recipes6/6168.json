The cinnamon is very important as it plays a huge part in the flavor. Best to use a few pieces of cinnamon stick rather then powder.  \nAlso you really only need 1-2 chipotle\u00b4s from a can depending on how hot you want it. A whole can would be VERY hot!!\nI would also add some chicken stock, for more flavor.",

If you are not accustomed to eating very spicy food begin with 1 or 2 peppers and some sauce. Taste it, if you want it hotter, add more! Also, someone mentioned using cinnamon. They do not use cinnamon in it where my in-laws are from in Mexico. I got the recipe from them. Remember that mexican food is very regional. It's taste varies from state to state. Thanks to everyone that took the time to try this recipe and rate it!",

However, it tasted really nice after everything simmered together for a while. I used a couple teaspoons of the abobo sauce and only one of the peppers as I was worried it would be too spicy for my wimpy tastebuds. I did throw a clove of garlic in the blender when I pureed the pepper and tomatoes and followed the suggestions of adding a cinnamon stick while simmering. I served these with a little bit of a shredded Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, and chopped cilantro on top. We really enjoyed this recipe, thank you!",

I'm looking at piles of laundry and tons of dirty dishes right now (ugh!) and knowing myself, there's nooo way I'll be spending much time preparing dinner because of it. Freda's tinga met my needs exactly - it's cheap, easy / quick to prepare and delicious! I've actually had this recipe in my in-box for quite some time, but it wasn't until my recent trip to Cancun that made me anxious to try it. The resort my hubby and I stayed at had tinga on their buffet. I gave it a try and LOVED it! Fredda's recipe was just as good, if not better. :) The addition of cinnamon (I added a cinnamon stick, broken in half) made this ever so slightly sweet, but in a good way. My only other changes were subbing a shredded rotisserie chicken for chicken breasts and adding a couple \"glugs\" of chicken broth halfway thru the simmering step. NOTE: I found 2 chipotle peppers / 2 t sauce to be spot on. Served on tostada shells with Boston Bibb lettuce leaves, shredded cheddar cheese, fresh pico de gallo, salsa verde and a dollop of crema (the BEST!) and Mexican rice / pinto beans on the side, this was a SUPERB and eye-appealing meal (the green lettuce, tinga mixture and bright pico looked lovely, almost Christmas-like!). Authentic Jarito's sodas were a perfect accompainment. My hubby commented that I should make this again - SOON! Thanks for sharing, Fredda O! :-)",
