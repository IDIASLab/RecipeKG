You will need more than 2 cups flour - I added additional flour 1/2 cup at a time, using a total of about 3 1/2 cups.  Also - you really do need 4 large onions.  I used the food processor to thinly slice the onions and then slowly carmalized them using 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil.  You will need to bake longer than 10 minutes - mine took about 15.  Next time I am going to add grated parmesan to the inside of the dough along with the onions.  Thanks for a fun project.  UPDATE:  I just noticed that this is supposed to make 24 rolls - I made 12 - used a muffin tin and they worked out great.",

Baked at 375 for 10 min. Then went up to 400 for another 6 minutes. This has the potential to be a great recipe it just needs some tinkering. Went over well at the dinner party.
