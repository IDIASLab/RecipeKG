I had only 1 tablespoon Chia seeds so added another tablespoon of Flaxseeds. Another main ingredient I did not have was Wheat Flour instead I ground 2/3 c. Bran Flakes. Instead of applesauce I cook and mashed ripe pears to make 2/3 c. I didn't add any of the optionals. I DID add an extra tablespoon of coconut oil thinking the bran flake flour would absorb more than the wheat flour.When I mixed all the ingredients I formed small balls and baked them as directed. They came out DELISH! My family loved them as well. Next time I will double this recipe.",

I weighed them before baking and each weighed 33 grams (approx. 1 ounce). I also had to add a TBSP and a half more applesauce than directed. Evidently my GF flour needs more liquid than regular wheat flour. I used all purpose GF flour in place of the whole wheat. I didn't care for the baking soda flavour and they didn't really rise so next time will be leaving that out for sure. I added the chocolate chips but not the shredded coconut. It took me 25 minutes to prepare everything then the cookies took 15 minutes to bake so figure in a bit more time than 25 minutes in all. Kids liked them. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
