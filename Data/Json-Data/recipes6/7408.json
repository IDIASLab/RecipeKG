When mom sent a can of Spam over for one of the boys, we were on that thing quicker than he could crack the can.  And when he did...that block of ham lying there cooking in its own juices like a ceviche in hell.  Anyways, just lifting back the top to another glorious chunk of Spam was just spectacular for me.  I did cry for three hours thinking about the good old days, but that's neither here nor there.  Signing off, General Jaybirds",
