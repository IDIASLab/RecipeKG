I don't know if I'm just too dumb to make this recipe correctly (I don't think I am), but it was an absolute disaster from the time I turned on the mixer.  First of all, I didn't know what speed to use.  I used a KitchenAid mixer with the wire whisk attachment, and tried to ascertain from its directions what speed to use (based on other, similar recipes), but that was not helpful. The mixture looked too thin in the beginning, so I tried mixing it at a higher speed.  Then the butter never mixed in (it floated on the top in clumps), and finally I ended up with a bunch of little wads of . . . butter?  egg? floating on the top of the liquid.  When I took it out of the oven, it looked like an oil slick--the top moved when I tilted the pan.  I have obviously done something wrong, because everyone else who rated this recipe thinks it's perfect.",
