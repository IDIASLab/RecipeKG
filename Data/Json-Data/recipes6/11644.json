Next time I'll try at least another 20 minutes. It looked done but then sank in the middle and was raw and doughy everywhere but the edges. However I baked it in stoneware and perhaps this made a difference. I would still highly recommend this recipe. I served them hot with Vanilla Ice Cream and \"Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce\" (also from this site). Awesome!",
