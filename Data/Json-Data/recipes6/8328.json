This comes together really quickly and rolling it out is a breeze but if you want to use the pasta cutter you need to add far more flour. Fettuccini was what I wanted but the dough stuck to the cutters.  My solution was to go back to the roller, add more semolina and fold the pasta sheets like an envelope and pass it through the roller several times unit the texture was dry enough. I find that bread and pasta recipes usually need adjustments, less or more flour, depending on the humidity in the air. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again and again.  Thanks you!",
