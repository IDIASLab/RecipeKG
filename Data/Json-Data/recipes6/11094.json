This is not really a torte to me although it's not really a cake in my opinion either. With more peaches it would end up more like a cobbler which might be a cool idea for next time. This is plenty sweet even without the full amount of sugar and it's easy and fun to make. The topping sort of absorbed into the peaches so I might not do that again--I might do a cinnamon sugar layer instead. Thanks for the recipe!",
