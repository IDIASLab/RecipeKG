I did sub fresh blueberries and raspberries for the lingonberries only because my store didn't offer the lingonberries. Also I doubled the extracts as that is how my family always prefers the use of the extracts. While it was still super delicious the vanilla and almond were right on the edge of being too much. While my family loved the stronger flavor many people won't. I would recommend NOT to follow in my footsteps on that. The beauty of this desert is the subtlety of it and the author of this recipe mastered it. Don't tweak as I did.",
