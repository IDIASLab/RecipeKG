This is very similar to my grandmother's old country recipe and it passed my father's taste test.  I followed the recipe as is with one note:  I do not stand and stir the lemon cheese the entire time....it takes entirely too long for that!  I keep an eye on it and stir it every 5-10 minutes with my whisk.  It does take about 30 - 45 minutes for the lemon to thicken, so be patient, it will be well worth it!  Remember, the lemon cheese will continue to thicken as it cools.  I also cut each layer in half and poked holes so the lemon cheese filling would ooze through the cake.  It is extra good!",

I don't have a clue why she called it \"lemon cheese cake\" and refers to the filling as \"lemon cheese filling\" when there is no cream cheese whatsoever in either the filling or the cake itself. Despite the misleading title the cake itself is extremely moist. The filling is very good and lemony the consistency and appearance is like a lemon meringue or lemon tartlet filling. One person remarked that it was \"too tart\" but everyone else who ate this cake said it was perfect. The cake was devoured which says it all. =) FYI I frosted the cake with a cream cheese/whip cream frosting and patted coconut all along the side I think it was a good mix of flavors. Overall this is a very good recipe.",
