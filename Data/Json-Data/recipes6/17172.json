I did brown the pork in about 1/2 Tbsp of oil with 1 tsp of butter.  For the sauce I mixed 1.5 cups beef broth, 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar, 3 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of white sugar, 1 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of salt (since the beef broth is pretty salty), 1 tsp each of garlic power and onion poweder, 1/2 tsp each of paprika and dry mustard, about 1 tsp of Frank's Red Hot and a dash of worcestershire.  I layered about 8 medium red pototoes (peeled) on the bottom of the crock pot, covered with onions, then put the browned roast on top.  Then I added baby carrots all around the sides.  I cooked on high for about 1 hour, then turned down to low and cooked for another 5 hours.  After 5 hours, I sliced the pork into about 10-12 pieces and put it in the bottom of the crock pot so it would be submerged in the juices.  I cooked for 1 additional hour and then removed all the veggies and pork and kept them warm on a platter.  Then I poured the juice into a pot, added a cornstarch slurry and brought it to a boil to make a gravy.  It was AWESOME!  And pretty healthy too!  Thanks for the great start, K :)",

I scrubbed some small red potatoes and put them in the pot whole with the pork steamed some asparagus to go with it and voila an easy and healthy dinner. I made two very minor changes to the basic recipe. I used raw sugar instead of white and substituted some chili infused vinegar for the red wine vinegar. This is one of those really good basic recipes that you can make so many little changes to and use over and over again. I'm going to try using hoisin then teriyaki in place of the ketchup to see how they change the taste.",

I omitted the salt, but added 1/4 t. ground ginger.
