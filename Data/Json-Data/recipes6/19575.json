Even using double the amount of coffee that this recipe calls for it wasn't overkill. I'd recommend increasing the coffee granule amount to 2 tsp if--like me--you love the flavor of coffee. I also used a few more ice cubes so it really was a shake-like consistency. This drink wasn't as sweet as some of the coffee-shop versions probably because of the use of vanilla rather than the vanilla syrup that the shops use so I'd probably increase the sugar a bit next time too. This drink was great topped with whipped topping drizzled with a bit more chocolate syrup.",
