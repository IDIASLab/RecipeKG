But baked as cupcakes with my own flavored buttercream frosting, these were some \"D\" good cupcakes.  I used a half recipe for 12 cupcakes, filled half full.  A generous amount of both shortening and buttermilk should ensure moistness, but still be careful not to overbake.  For this half recipe, I made this buttercream:  2-1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup butter, a capful of Watkins caramel flavor, several good shakes of apple pie spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, or pumpkin pie spice would have been good too) and enough buttermilk to get it to the consistency I wanted - didn't measure, just added dribble by dribble.  These are light and fluffy with a deliciously delicate caramel-spice flavor. This current Africa hot weather, and this recipe made me in the mood for fall and fall baking!",

I baked this in two 9\" square pans and they took approx 23 minutes to bake. For the icing I used 2 cups of confectionery sugar (instead of 3) and less than 1/4 cup of butter milk (to keep it to a spreadable consistency). I didn't find this dry in the least. But I think not over baking this and keeping your buttermilk consistency a little thick is the trick!! Also since the recipe for the icing doesn't mention it i added 'only a pinch' of nutmeg into the butter. I liked it but add nutmeg only if you want a little extra spice otherwise skip it! Oh and by-the-way the cake has a real Christmasy feel to this too... so it's a good idea for a Christmas Platter!:) Thanks for the recipe Ginger!:D",
