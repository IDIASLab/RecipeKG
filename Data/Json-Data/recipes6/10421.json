It definitely has a chocolate flavor but I was disappointed that there wasn't much of an almond flavor to it and I even added 1/2 teaspoon more of the almond extract. The bread was nic and soft in fact it was a little too soft when I cut it it was kind if crumbly. I may make this again and add a little more almod extraxct next time. My kids and husband liked it so if I make it again it will be more for them.",
