I omitted the sugar, and used some of the pineapple juice instead, and I also added a good splash of Fish Sauce for more of an authentic Thai flavor. Finally, I didn't bother cooking my noodles separately - I just added them to the soup, and let them soften in the broth. This was absolutely delicious, and something I will definitely make again.

I also omitted the tomato and celery added a generous helping of rice vinegar (about 1/2 cup) and used a LOT MORE soy sauce than what it called for (about 1/4 cup or so). (I like my soup salty and sour!) This was really good and filling. For those on Weight Watchers: as made 1 serving equals 4 PlusPoints. Delicious. Thanks Kathleen!",
