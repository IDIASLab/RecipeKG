I've made it several times, and it always comes out perfectly.  Just be sure to cool the cocoa and boiling water before adding them to the machine, or the heat will kill the yeast.\n\nI will agree with other reviewers that you can't expect a brownie or a piece of cake when you eat this.  It's less sweet, less dessert-like.  It's especially great for when you want something special and different and interesting, but not sugary.\n\nIn the words of one of my friends: \"This doesn't know if it's bread or cake.  I'm eating food with an identity disorder!\"  I love it for that, but apparently not everyone does.  Definitely worth a try though!",

More or less followed the given directions of mixing the cocoa and water and the yeast and water, but instead of just throwing everything together, I added 1c of the flour to the yeast water after it sat for a bit, then added the sugar, salt, and oil.  After mixing that, I added the chocolate, mixed and added two whole eggs.  Then I started adding the rest of the flour, about 1/2 c at a time, until I hit the 3c mark.  It was still a little sticky at this point, so I added a few T more, until I could handle the dough.  Kneaded the bread as much as I could, but not as much as usual. I put it in a loaf pan and let it rise in a warm oven until it had more or less doubled, then preheated the oven to 375 and baked it for about 25 minutes, although there is a small amount in the middle of the loaf that seems like it didn't cook completely through, and the top is rather dark, so maybe 350 for 30 minutes would have been better. Definitely would try this again!",

I placed in my bread machine according to directions and then put it on the DOUGH cycle. When completed I took the dough out punched it down on a floured countertop (it was quite sticky) split it in half (makes 2 smaller loaves or one big loaf) placed in greased bread pans in a warm oven for 30 minutes. Warm oven up to 350 and cook for 25 minutes. I made this this morning and my mom and I have already eaten half a loaf because it is SO good. While it certainly does not taste like brownies it was moist filling and has a delicious chocolaty after taste! It also makes the house smell amazing... I will certainly make this bread again with the changes as it will be AMAZING with a peanutbutter banana sandwich!",

I used slightly less sugar (about 1/2 cup) and left out the one egg yolk. I froze the second loaf for later. The chocolate and sweetness are subtle. Don't expect it to taste like a brownie.
