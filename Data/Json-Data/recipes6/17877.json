                "reviewBody": "Delicious recipe!  As other reviewers have mentioned, the amount of sauce is very scant in proportion to the meatballs (this made about 50 one-inch meatballs).  If you're serving as an appetizer, I'm sure the single batch of sauce is fine.  But if you're serving as a meal and like enough sauce to flavor your rice as well, you'll definitely need to double the sauce recipe.  I did so (using 4 TBS cornstarch) and it made just the right amount.  I think I will increase the oven time for the meatballs to 20 mins next time since I believe they'll hold together a little better in the sauce if they're cooked just a tad longer in the oven first.  I added the pineapple chunks during the last 5 mins of simmering as suggested by another reviewer.  I'm sure this yummy sauce would work well with just about any kind of meat.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! :-)",

However the amount of sauce indicated isn't nearly enough to allow for a proper simmer so you should probably make 1.5 times the amount or double it. If you are in a hurry (or wish to confirm that the meatballs are thoroughly cooked) you can let the meatballs bake a little longer (additional 5 minutes) while you prepare the sauce. FYI - The finished product will almost fill a 9\" x 13\" container (depending on the amount of the sauce).",

I was referred to as the 'meatball girl' and they have begged me to share the recipe with them. I am telling you - this is a great recipe for meatballs!\r\n\r\nWhen I was done making these meatballs, I transfered it to a crockpot and left it on low and it kept them nice and warm for the party.

I still stand true to MEMBER81872's sweet and sour meatballs. They were the first I ever tried (I stumbled upon the recipe in the Allrecipes cookbook I received ages ago) and are by far the best - EVER!!!:) Lana's MB's were mediocre in comparison. It just goes to show you that sometimes the overlooked recipes on here are the real gems (Member's recipe has only 24 reviews). I usually find myself tweaking new recipes but didn't make any major changes this time. All I did was substitute a red bell pepper for the green one called for (happened to have one handy) and halve the MB portion. I don't consider either of these modifications drastic enough to significantly alter the recipe and they in no way swayed my rating. I kept everything else as is and am glad I did. I had plenty of sauce to cover my MB's and veggies with. Served atop steamed white rice with Hawaiian rolls on the side this was an allright meal. I'm glad to have given your recipe a try but the vote at my house is no repeat (sorry!). Thanks anyways Lana!:-)",
