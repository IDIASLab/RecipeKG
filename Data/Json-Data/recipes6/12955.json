                "reviewBody": "What a great filled cookie!  Here are some suggestions for making it easier.\n1. A regular size canning jar ring is a perfect size for the circles.\n2. The dough is very soft to handle.  Try doing only a small amount at a time, enough for 6-8 circles.  Keep the rest of the dough in the fridge until you are ready for it.  Use lots of flour, stopping every couple rolls of the rolling pin to move the dough around and add flour if necessary to keep it from stick to the work surface.  \n3. Raisins are very sweet in and of themselves.  I cut the sugar in the filling back to 1/4 cup.  Next time I'll eliminate it altogether. I also eliminated the nuts.  \n4. I chopped the raisins in my food processor, along with some of the water for the filling.  It worked like a charm.  I'll probably make 1 1/2 batches of filling next time for 1 batch of dough.\n5. For a slightly fancier look, use your fingertips to crimp edges as you would a pie crust. To go simple, just press edges together.\n6.  If you want the filling to show through, cut a small x in the top circle of dough before you place it on top.  \n7.  And...a piece of advice, from my experience...this is a recipe to keep until the kids are in bed.  Don't try it with a 3 year old wanting to help, and a sick, fussy 8 month old to hold!",

I did use the filling recipe however and boy is it ever a sweet eyes-rolled-back-into-your-head filling. Very good indeed! I put my raisins into my blender to grind them but they quickly became gummy so I added the water which worked like a charm. You do have to watch it carefully as it will quickly become very soupy. Pulsing with a food processor if you have one would probably be an easier choice. A wonderful cookie for those with a sweettooth!",

I could tell as I mixed it that it might be too soft so I added approximately 1/4 cup. I had to put it in the freezer rather than the fridge as I needed it quicker. You still need to have flour on the table as you roll it out but you'll have less trouble if you add a little more flour while you're making the dough. My batch made 3 dozen cookies. I made a few with strawberry jam filling just to add variety for my family. I'll make these again as they are a favorite of my husband's.",
