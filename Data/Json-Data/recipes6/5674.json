I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I'm not a fan of onion, so I left that out. I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so I chopped up three roma tomatoes and added a bit more water to make up for the lack of tomato juice. Instead of using frozen corn, I used an ear of fresh corn and sliced off the kernels. I also added a jalapeno to give it a little bit of kick. Overall though, a good recipe! I can't wait to see how it will fare for lunch tomorrow. UPDATE: My boyfriend loves this recipe so much - it is now my go-to chili for him. I  had to bump it up to 5 stars. I used a can of diced tomatoes with habeneros, and it gave it just the right amount of spice.",

I added some salt and some garlic salt because I wasn't using the seasoning packet from the box.  My entire family loved this, including a 1, 3, and 6 year old:)",
