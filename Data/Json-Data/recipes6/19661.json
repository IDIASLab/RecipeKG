If I made it again however I would make a couple changes: I would make 3/4 the amount of prune filling as they were VERY pruney. I would use a greased 13x9 pan rather than a cookie sheet to contain the large amount of streusel. I would let the dough rise 20 min before adding the filling (I missed that addition below when I made them). And I'd bake them longer -- I'd try 20-30 min as they were a bit doughey with the current recommended time. I would still recommend this recipe though. Definitely a yummy way to eat prunes!",

These little things are awesome! The filling is absolutely spectacular. I was afraid it was going to be too spicy as it cooked on the stove- but once blended WOW! I had leftover so I am saving it for a spread on my morning bagel- It is SO good. I had some troubel getting the dough out of my bread machine- it was really sticky so i had to flour my work surface and hands and i dumped the dough out and ended up cutting my \"eggs\" with a knife molding them on the pan. The dough came out fine. I made some on a metal pan (smaller- cooked 5 minutes longer than recommeded) and some in a casserole dish as another reviewer recommended (big ones- 10 minutes longer than recommended). Make these- they are very good.",

For the prune filling, I don't follow a recipe since I learned from watching my mother but is pretty much the same, I never used lime juice before but I think that may be something I will try.
