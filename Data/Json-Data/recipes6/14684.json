It will be nearly cool and ready to spread by the time the other ingredients are assembled.  If you want a more \"true\" eclair taste, use honey graham crackers instead of chocolate.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to butter the pan first, and you do not need a full package of graham crackers.  I counted about 20 in my 13x9 pan.  \r\n\r\nTake the time to make the chocolate sauce.  It tastes much better than canned, and doesn't have all that heart-clogging palm oil in it.  Also, the sauce needs only 1/2 t. vanilla in my opinion.",
