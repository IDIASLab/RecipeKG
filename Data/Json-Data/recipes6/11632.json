It's not a gourmet recipe so it doesn't have a lot of complex flavors or textures-- it's a straight forward stick to your ribs kind of side dish that adults and children both enjoy (my family calls it a cornbread which it kind of resembles). As weird as it is I've noticed different people can follow this exact same recipe with significantly different results. For example when my sister tried to follow this recipe it came out looking like mush-- I have no idea why. In any event I agree with other reviewers that if you are using the Jiffy mix to cut down on the sugar (I use half the recommended amount). I also increased the baking time but every oven is different so just remember to check on it a couple times while it's baking.",
