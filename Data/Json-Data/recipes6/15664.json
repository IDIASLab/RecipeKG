I doubled the punch only adding one bottle of rum and found that to be plenty!

I brought it to my family's Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! In fact I should have made more!",

I like adult tasting punches but this was way too strong and I even cut back on the rum. Even after adding Sprite I found that it tasted like the rinds of the fruit and the bitterness of the carbonated water did not help the situation. Like the previous reviewer says if you add a ton of fruity sweet additions you may be able to choke it down. I would not make this again or even try to alter it. Big disappointment!",
