I did read these reviews closely, at least until the general techniques that make this good recipe even better began to become apparent. I  added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and allspice to the dry ingredients, substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and added 1 cup of golden raisins to the batter. I also doubled the frosting, and had plenty to frost the cake plus a little left over. Then, since I'm baking at an altitude of 8,000-feet, I increased the flour to 2-1/4 cups, decreased the baking powder to 1-1/2 teaspoons, decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, increased the baking temperature to 375F and decreased the cooking time to 40 minutes. I made 2-9\" rounds (parchment/grease/floured, of course) and they came out perfectly. Guess I better start a cake section in my home recipe book, because this one will be made a few times a year! Thanks, Linda! And thanks to all those real bakers who take the time and effort to make such great suggestions for us neophytes!",
