I used more dried cranberries and walnuts. I also toasted the walnuts as suggested. I also didn't have white vinegar on hand and so I combined balsamic red wine and rice vinegar all together. They really worked together well. I used 1/2 as much oil and less sugar too. I also didn't want to buy dry mustard so I used dijon mustard instead. It was so delicious and I paired it with a pumpkin soup from this website also for a nice fall dinner. The slaw holds up really well too in the fridge. Just delicious.",

Use organic ingredients, if possible, which is not only healthier, but more flavorful.  \n\nMakes good leftovers for days, remaining crisp.  I made only slight variations.  They are as follows:\n\n1) Chopped organic green & purple cabbage (16 oz)\nNOTE: Using shredded may result in the wilting that some cooks have complained of.\n2) Unsweetened cranberries - the corn sugar and/or syrup that is often added is unnecessary.\n3) Sauteed walnuts w/ olive oil.\nNOTE: Olive oil is not heat stable and should never be used over medium or higher heat.  It should really only be used over low heat to avoid toxic gases.\n4) 2 Tbsp sugar\n5) White wine vinegar vs. distilled\n6) Olive oil vs. vegetable oil\n7) 1 shredded carrot\n\nView the photo that I've added to see the resulting festive appearance.  Yum!",
