This seems to work fine for me and no it is not too much yeast nor does the dough smell yeasty. I also used 1 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp called for in the recipe. I found that it accentuated the sweetness without the calories. This is truly the best recipe ever for bolos l\u00eavedos. If you use a kneading machine 10 minutes is enough. Make sure you save about 1/2 cup of flour from recipe to add in the end so that the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. It makes it easier on the machine. I used King Arthur's flour for bread making and it works. There is no comparison between these bolos l\u00eavedos and the store-bought ones. I have been making this recipe every week. I freeze the bolos in zipperlock bags and thaw one at a time. Thanks Titia Deolinda! P.S. if you are watching what you eat and if you make 16 bolos (not hard at all) out of this recipe each bolo is 5 Weight Watchers points. Good size bolo too...",

These were a favourite treat growing up when my mother brought them home from the shop and now they are going to be a favourite of my daughters (and husband) when I make them at home.  \n\nI read through the reviews and my experience was so different from many of the others.  Although we all seemed to love the results, it seems that some put way more effort in than I did.  I placed all the ingredients at once into my Kitchen aid and let it go for about ten minutes.  Then I let it rise in my oven with the oven light on for an hour or two.  This resulted in a nice, elastic dough that I kneaded lightly and cut in to 16 parts.  With a rolling pin I rolled (only three rolls in total) the dough balls into flat circles.  I let them rise again on a well oiled parchment paper and gave them an extra coating on top to make sure they didn't stick.  \n\nWhen they were ready to cook, I heated a cast iron griddle on med-low heat and gently placed each patty on to the pan and cooked for 2 minutes a side.  They were perfect.  \n\nHonestly, if I spent more than hour of actual labour on these I would be surprised.",
