I never heard of sour milk, other than milk gone bad in the fridge, so I googled it:  1- Place 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice or distilled white vinegar in a glass measuring cup. 2- Add in milk (2% or richer) to equal 1 cup. Stir. 3- Let stand for 15 minutes until it looks like its beginning to curdle or slightly curdled.  Worked like a charm! I didn't peel my apples either because most of the nutrients sit under the skin of fruits, so if I'm going to eat something not so good for me, it may as well have some nutritional value...lol. Mostly though, I'm lazy. Tasted great peels and all. ",
