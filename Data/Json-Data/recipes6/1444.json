El Pato is available in my area in the spicy Salsa de Jalapeno (green can) and Salsa de Chile Fresco (hotter) in the yellow can. I had the Salsa de Jalapeno on hand so that s what I used. I followed the instructions tasted and we wanted something a little spicier. I added some more of the tomato sauce and even a good sprinkle of cayenne as well as some salt and pepper. Don t think for a minute traditional sloppy joes otherwise you may be disappointed. We didn t and we weren t and they were good!",

I did not have the Mexican tomato sauce so I substituted it with 8 ounces of canned tomato sauce and 8 slices of pickled jalapeno slices (chopped). I added 4 tablespoons of tomato paste and about 1/2 cup water. (You may have to adjust the amount of water.) I cut back on the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. I increased the chili powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Now my husband likes it much better.",
