You can also add thinly diced onions or red pepper flakes to the batter if you wish. I like to serve these with jalapeno jelly for breakfast or chili for dinner, and sometimes I eat them with barbeque sauce slathered on top.",

I did mix all the ingredients together and then fold in the egg whites instead of starting with the whites because that's how I think waffles are made.  I used my waffle bowl maker and served a waffle bowl buffet with bacon, chicken, cheese, etc.  Delicious!",

I did take a nibble but left the verdict up to the husband. I didn't care for the corn but he liked it. The one thing we agreed on is that it could use a tad bit more sugar. Other than that this was perfect! These are super fun and make a wonderful presentation.",
