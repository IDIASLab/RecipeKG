I am always horrified by the amount of eggs and oil in these breads, so I made some easy substitutions to make it even healthier, but SHHHH, I don't tell anyone when I give it to them!  I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of regular flour and put one of those little containers of applesauce (approx. 1/3 cup) in the 1 cup measuring cup before filling it the rest of the way up with olive oil. NO, you can't taste the difference.  I also replace the cinnamon/nutmeg mixture with 1 teaspoon EACH of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, and I used LIGHT coconut milk too.  Toasting the nuts and adding coconut flakes is unnecessary. ;)",

The flaked coconut is completely uneccesary, and I didn't toast the walnuts and it turned out perfectly.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves for an extra kick and using Light Coconut Milk gives the same great results.  I've made this 3 times in less than two weeks and my husband can't get enough.  Great for giving since it stays moist for so long! **2nd UPDATE** - I've substituted unsweetened applesauce for ALL of the oil and and coconut milk (which has a lot of cholestrol and fat!) and it turned out phonomenal!  The applesauce kept the bread SUPER moist and you can't taste it at all. Due to the wetness, it did take an extra 5 min. in the oven. Will never use oil/coconut milk in this  again.",
