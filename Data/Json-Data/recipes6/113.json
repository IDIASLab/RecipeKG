I made a larger (2.5x) batch for work and added in a lot more bourbon almost triple which was needless to say a bit much. Sending the hubby out for more ketchup to mellow the sauce out a bit I finally came to a good ratio and everyone at work loved them. Unfortunately I don't have an exact amount for the bourbon I used but it was at least twice as much. Because of my experimenting I was left with a bunch of sauce that we froze and plan to use later for more smokies and salmon.",
