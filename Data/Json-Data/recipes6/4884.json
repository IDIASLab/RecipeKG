Unfortunately the juice from my 2 lemons was too much - it was way too lemony and sour. My lemons were med to large large in size and very juicy. Unless you have small lemons I would start with one and you can always add more. Secondly I had little egg white bits in the soup which I think was the result of adding the hot soup to the egg / lemon - it just cooked the eggs right away. It didn't bother me but I know that's not how it's supposed to come out - maybe I will ladle some soup and let it cool off next time?",
