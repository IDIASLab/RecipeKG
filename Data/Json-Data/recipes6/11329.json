LOL\r\n\r\nMy only comment would be that I used a 9 X 13 pan and that was plenty big.  The cake was less than an inch tall using that pan.  I've never seen a 13 X 15 pan, but I can't imagine it would have given me a very thick cake if I had used one.\r\n\r\nWe'll definitely be making this again!\r\n\r\nThanks!",
