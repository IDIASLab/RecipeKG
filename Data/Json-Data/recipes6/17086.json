I even added some malted milk powder to the chocolate part and it didn't help. I think the brownie base was too strong that it covered up the malt taste in the frosting (which by the way tasted great and \"malty\" by itself). Everyone in my family said the bars were very good but really rich. However they didn't even know that they were MALT bars until I told them (they thought that the frosting was made from condensed milk not malt). I think next time I will double the frosting recipe spread it over a light cake instead of the brownies and still sprinkle it with the crushed malt balls. I'll keep looking for the malt recipe that makes my dad say \"Wow!\"",
