Then, pour part of the hot glaze into the pan, put the cake back into the pan, and pour the rest of the glaze on top.

I followed the recipe exactly, with a few minor variations: used butter instead of shortening, and increased \"cake\" cinnamon to 1 TB and \"topping\" cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.

The cinnamon syrup is what makes it really tasty and unique. My only word of caution - the syrup pools around the bottom of the cake. I don't think it would keep well. If you are not planning to serve a group and finish the whole cake at once you may want to just spoon the syrup over each slice instead of pouring it over the whole cake at once.",

I had hoped the icing would be more like a glaze and not as runny but that may be due to my lessening the butter in the icing to 3 tbsp. I also altered the actual recipe since I don't like my cakes really sweet and I thought the amount of butter originally called for seemed to be a bit too much for this amount of cake. I changed the recipe from 2/3cup butter to 1/2cup (or 1 stick) butter and from 1 1/3cup sugar to 3/4cup sugar. The cake still turned out great according to my tastes and I'll continue to use this recipe for a breakfast cake to go along with my morning coffee.",
