I left out the nuts and coconut out of personal preference but I really don't think they're worse off without them. The texture is somewhere between a pecan sandie and a good crumbly peanut butter cookie. While they don't have a greasy appearance or mouthfeel once you pick one up you'll be looking for a napkin to wipe your fingers on. I halved the recipe and made the cookies small and got 55. I've already eaten an embarrassing amount of them so I don't think I'll make them again until I have somewhere to take them so someone else can eat them too. Thanks!",

Instead of adding 1 cup of vegetable oil, i would only use 1/2 cup of oil and substitute the rest for water. This made my cookies less greasy and not as fattening. Also i replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips because i am not a fan of nuts.  I would definitly recommend these cookies for any occasion.",
