It was fairly easy to roll, and I only ended up with one crack which I disguised by tucking under. There was extra filling left over, but it was tasty and I used it for something else, so no harm was done there!! \r\n\r\nThe cake was moist and wonderful. I changed nothing in the recipe, and shall make it again!",
