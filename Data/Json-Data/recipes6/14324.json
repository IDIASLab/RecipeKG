The only thing negative about this pie (except the fact that it disappears too fast!) is that the \"custard\" almost always goes over the plate during cooking even with a deep-dish one!! I think the trick to overcome this difficulty is to put the rhubarb in a conic shape so there is more room for the custard. Once cooked it is all \"leveled\". I also tried to put 2 eggs instead of 3 it worked fine but you still have to do the conic shape.",

After 50 minutes the pie was nice and brown and looked done so I took it out of the oven and cooled for 1 hour and 20 minutes. When I cut into it it was still liquid inside. I had no choice but to throw it back into the oven to try and salvage it. I baked it for 30 more minutes and much to my surprise it was still wonderful. Next time I will bake it for at least 60 minutes no matter how brown it looks. Also this fit perfectly into a deep dish 9\" pan although it came right to the top.",
