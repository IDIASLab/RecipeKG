Of course it didn't cream real well and I thought they were ruined. But as soon as I added the flour they were fine. Also I did not have ground cloves so I ground whole cloves in a coffee grinder. This made the clove flavor a little strong. I'll just use a little less next time. They have a great soft chewy texter and hold their shape when they cook. I didn't even bother with the frosting since they were very good without. Great recipie.",
