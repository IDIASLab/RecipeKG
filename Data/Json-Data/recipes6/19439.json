First, don't beat the zucchini with the oil, sugar and egg. Just add it to that mixture, then stir in the flour mixture till blended. I used a full tablespoon of lemon zest, and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Once the bread was done, I let it cool in the pan 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I made a glaze of 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I heated it till boiling to dissolve the sugar, then removed it from the heat. I removed the bread from the pan and brushed on the glaze, continuing to reapply it as it was absorbed. (Didn't poke holes in the top as I didn't want HOLES in the top!) This glaze made a beautiful, shiny top, and infused the bread with both moisture and incredibly delicious lemon zing! Outstanding.",

Used whole wheat flour in place of white, instead of the oil and white sugar, I used 1/4 cup honey (gave it a wonderful, homey smell and taste), 1/4 brown sugar (a little less...I don't like it too sweet) and added chopped pecans. I have also tried adding 1 1/2 cups shredded carrot, which also turned out great. Fool-proof, delicious and easy to make substitutions. I love it! Thank you for sharing!",
