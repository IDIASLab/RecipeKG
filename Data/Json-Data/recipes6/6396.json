If making a bunch of wings, heat the oven to 275 and hold the wings in the oven while you do the next batch.",

                "reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe and nearly halved the salt. The chicken wings came out looking beautiful and their texture was pretty good although I do feel they could have been crunchier. This may have been my fault though since the oil - especially during the 2nd batch dropped in temperature to around 320 or so instead of 375 which I think may have contributed to things. I ate most of the chicken wings without any sauce since I can't have too much sodium and I felt they had virtually no flavour. I may make again in the future being sure to keep the oil hot and perhaps adding more salt but I think I prefer baking chicken wings as deep frying is always so messy.",
