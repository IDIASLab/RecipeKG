In my opinion this recipe needs three major adjustments: 1. Double the amount of chocolate 2. Add the chocolate mixture just before blending the flour & sour milk; the recipe instructions give no indication of WHEN to add the chocolate. This could be disastrous to a novice cook. 3. Use a 9x9 pan (9x13 is way too big as the cake will turn out very flat)",
