To those users I'd like to say that your cream was not bad but simply, you whipped it for too long.  Heavy cream that has been whipped for long periods of time will eventually go past that beautiful \"stiff peak\" stage into a less appealing state of ..... you guessed it, butter!  Hence the butter churn from days gone by.  The milky substance that accompanies the butter is known as buttermilk. (thanks grandma) I hope other users have found this information helpful and to those who already knew this..... my apologies!!  Otherwise, great recipe Tom!!",

I want to mention that I used heavy whipping cream instead of just heavy cream(not sure if it makes a difference)I used it on a Duncan Hines strawberry cake(2 layers) and it's a great contrast against the sweetness of the cake.If you want it a little sweeter add an extra 1/2c. powdered sugar.",

Here's what I did different, based on other reviews:  chilled bowl, whip, and whipping cream in freezer for 10 minutes before whipping it up;  used 1 pint whipping cream, 1 pint HEAVY whipping cream;  used approximately 3/4 cup powdered sugar in place of granulated (measured it first, then sifted into cream cheese mixture).  SO!  It was yummy and I will be making it again!  I highly recommend this recipe if you are looking for something nice and light-tasting (but not light calorie wise!)",

As someone with lots of cake decorating experience, I would say this is a wonderful filling, but is not suited for frosting (unless you just dollop it on top).  This recipe is VERY soft, and does NOT firm up upon refigeration like a buttercream.  I made a double batch to decorate a large cake and ditched that plan shortly after I started decorating.  I froze this double batch until I thought of a use for it (decided to add it to leftover white rice, added a bit of milk, cinnamon, and a touch more vanilla... it was the most delicious rice pudding imagineable).  I might use it as a tart filling sometime, topped with seasonal fruits.  Really delicious stuff.  PS - I read that it piped well, but I have enough decorating experience to tell that was not going to be the case.",
