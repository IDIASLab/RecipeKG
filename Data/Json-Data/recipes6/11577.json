After tasting it, however, I'm certain I'm going to make it again, as it is some of the best chicken I've ever had. This is an ancient Roman recipe from the book of Apicus, so some ingredients are hard to find or I am uncertain as to what they actually are.  For Saturei I used dried rose petals, for Liquamen I used 1 cup wine plus 1 tbs salt, and instead of Defritum (fig syrup), you can use sweet and tangy steak sauce.",

If you cannot find it thyme is a close substitute but dried savory is lighter than dried thyme and has a slight lemony smell. This would eliminate the unecessary hassle of drying rose petals! I had a kitchen garden and grew many herbs including summer savory (annual) and winter savory(perennial). Liquamen was a Roman salty fish sauce. You could probably use Thai fish sauce or anchovy paste as a substitute. I have not made this yet but am looking forward to it.",

For my own part I made this dish for Valentine's Day. The meal was good and tasted very exotic/unique/classy. However the ingredients were expensive and the taste in my opinion didn't make up for the cost and the preparation time (drying the rose petals chopping all the spices & veggies). Also I found the fig syrup totally unnecessary since it didn't even taste like fig just like sugar. Also I have no idea what to do with the figs now. The meal was fine and we both liked it but I wouldn't make it again. PS: I used Cornish game hens instead of a chicken and the meat was succulent.",

I had no problem finding dried rose petals (very inexpensive) at the local health food store and substituted fresh dill for 1.5 tbs. dried and the leek with onion (only because I didn't have any leeks in the house at the time. Canned figs aren't that hard to find in the grocery store but instead I used honey with this again b/c I had forgotten the figs. Figs however are great on toast in the morning - I grew up eating them this way as my grandmother always had homemade fig preserves around the house (where the best fig syrup can be used).",
