I put my chopped rhubarb in the saucepan and usually I toss in 1/2-1 c raspberries for color.  Once tender, rather than draining and blending I just use my immersion blender.  Then add the remaining ingredients (but only HALF the SUGAR) and I always use Brandy instead of Gin.  Its so quick and easy - and delicious.\n\nUPDATE:  I made this tonight with Blackberry Brandy and Grape juice concentrate instead of Orange (again 1/2 the sugar).  Delicious!  I think this might be my favorite version now.",
