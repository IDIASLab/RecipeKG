I can't describe exactly what happened when the spices hit the oil, but I can tell you that it felt like my lungs had collapsed.  My kids literally ran screaming from the kitchen and I finished cooking with a dish towel over my nose and mouth.  I really think the heat is too high on this because I made something similar later on at a lower temp and didn't have anything like this happen.    I'm still giving this four stars though because this is the best tamarind chutney I've ever tasted.  If you don't have access to tamarind paste (I'm talking to you, my fellow rural Iowans!) then you can make a delicious substitute using 1 tablespoon each of dried, chopped apricots, dates and prunes.  Pour boiling water on them and let them soak for fifteen minutes and then drain and puree them with one tablespoon lemon juice.",

I used olive oil instead of canola (it's what I had), and I made sure to heat the spices in the oil for long enough to really smell all of those spices.  If you add the water too soon, you'll lose some of the flavor.  I used onion powder in place of the asofe...(spice I can't even spell).  Like some of the other reviews mentioned, I couldn't get the sauce thick enough without a little cornstarch.  I actually simmered it for about an hour to reduce it, but still ended up adding a little cornstarch (teaspoon dissolved in hot water?), which made it a perfect consistency.  Seriously, you can't buy stuff this good.  ",

I had a tamarind \"block\" so I probably used twice as much tamarind as the recipe calls for. Tangy, sweet, spicy- perfect: had it with onion pakora's as a start to our Indian meal. Of Note:  recipe states makes 1 & 1/4 cups of chutney. Cook it down to this point and you wont need any cornstarch or such. Also use the cold plate method to check for consistency. Simply put a saucer in the fridge, when you think your sauce is done, put a small amount (1/4 t.) on the cold plate and place back in fridge. Wait a minute and check. If it is how you like it, pull from the heat or cook longer. Thanks for a simple recipe addition to my Indian arsenal, one more sauce I will never have to buy again. PS: Tamarind is a popular ingredient in Mexican cooking. Try those grocery stores for it. Hing or Asafoetida is an Indian staple, if you can't find it add a 1/4 t of garlic powder as a sub.",

I recommend using medium-low heat; the spices are very aromatic and really can be overwhelming on a higher heat. I found the 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper was a bit lost once the chutney was cooled and served. If you like spice increase to 3/4 or 1 tsp. Instead of 1 1/8 cups white sugar I used 1 cup jaggery and five pitted dates. I too used about a tsp of corn starch dissolved in a few tbsp of water to thicken the sauce but the next day the chutney was more jelly-like than I'd have liked so I recommend using 1/2 tsp of corn starch or omitting it altogether. I used onion powder instead of the asafoetida powder and I omitted the fennel seeds because I don't care for fennel. I also found it would have benefited from a quick run through the hand blender as it was quite chunky and near the end was a little difficult to use as a sauce and was more like a jam.",
