Maybe it a little cream cheese was put in the mix it would be better. I made them way tooo big. These are very sweet. Next time I will make them the size of an oreo not the size of my hand. My 7 year old son had one and finished about 3/4 of one and started to feel sick from it being so sweet. It made about 16 large pies which I froze 8 of. I ran out of syranwrap so I put 4 pies in a dish placed wax paper over them and put 4 more on top put the lid on the dish and froze them. I'm looking forward to trying them frozen.",

But judging from other people's reviews and Mr.Wiki I pretty much managed to figure what these would turn out like. They were good I did lessen the sugar to 3/4 cup (I half the original amount)because some said it was really sweet. I also added cinnamon and all spice for extra umph (I was a bit sick of the plain chocolate taste). The consistency was thick enough to be piped so that you'll get a more even shape ( I figured that out half way baking 'em - duhh!) Didn't make the filling used peanut butter buttercream instead and they became super-super good! Will make them again!:)",
