Even my ten year old who hates breakfast foods of any kind loved these. My neice who says she doesn't like waffles had two plates.

I was a little concerned about them being too eggy so I only used three eggs. We really liked the light airy texture yet crispy outsides. We ate them with butter and syrup or apple butter but I can't wait to try them with strawberries and whipped cream! My waffle maker must be a little smaller than the recipe author's because I got 6-1/2 waffles out of this recipe. The leftovers went into the freezer for a quick breakfast another day!",

My husband couldn't even tell the difference. But they were still really good. I just don't know if they're different enough to make the prep time worth it. Also if you're looking for a crisp waffle this isn't the recipe But I like mine soft. I made it the night before and let it rise in the fridge-still turned out fine. It did make more waffles than the recipe indicated which wasn't a problem! I made the rest up and froze them. I tried one today after popping it in the toaster and it still tasted great! I would probably make this again but only if I have time to kill.",

The first time I tried this I followed the recipe...excellent. The 2nd time I tried it I didn't have the time or all of the ingredients...turned out great also..here is what I did the 2nd time. I didn't have time to whip the whites so I just added them whole. I also ran out of vanilla so I used immitation rum extract. It gave the waffles an awesome flavor. Also for the milk I always use non-fat milk so I added the sugar to the warm milk then sprinkled the yeast. It frothed up better that way. Kids thought these were the cream of the crop. Oh..I also had my waffle iron on 6 (hottest setting). Happy waffle making!",
