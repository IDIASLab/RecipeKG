Whenever I order the meat from the meat market, I order ground ham and pork from a local meat market premixed. I order triple the meat required, packaged into three packages, give one to my mother, use one, and freeze one to use later. Serve these with horseradish.",

Also used bread crumbs instead of crackers. Used a generous 1/3 cup measuring cup to make consistent loafs to get 14. Next time would use 1/2 cup. The smaller 1/3 loaves I flip at one hour and tested temp and they were already done. I left in oven so glaze could caramelize on both sided. Then popped under the broiler to brown.",

The one change I made was I brought the glaze to a boil on the stovetop before adding it to the raw meat. I saved part of the glaze to add after the meat was cooked and basted 2-3 times while the meat was cooking. This is a delicious recipe that my family really enjoyed. I served this with Spinach and Sweet Corn Mashed Potatoes another AR recipe and a simple salad. I ve made ham loaves many many times but this was the first time I formed them in mini loaves. I liked it better than making 1 large loaf. Thanks Deb for sharing your version of Ham Loaf.",
