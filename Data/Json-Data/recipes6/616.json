(Watching our sugar intake) However with that said, I replaced that with apple pie spice, dried fennel seed, and a touch of paprika. Those spices have natural sweetness to them. Since ground turkey can be dry due to the lack of fat, I patted the sausage out and allowed them to rest in the refrigerator over night to tenderize and soak up all of the flavors. The sausage came out great!!! I cooked them on a non-stick griddle with a touch of EVOO and they came out yummy!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!",

Also we included a teaspoon of McCormick Maple Smokehouse seasoning as well as their Cajun seasoning. Instead of pan frying we lightly spray greased a an oven sheet and baked them, flipping occasionally. \nOverall this recipe was terrific! For a large family who is transitioning to much healthier choices this was a recipe that satisfied everyone. I'm convinced that we won't be buying sausage anymore",

I used regular 85/15 ground turkey, added garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, ground savory, Mrs Dash lemon pepper, and ground ginger. I also upped the rest of the herbs. I do think it's a bit sweet so next time I'll cut back to 1 tsp sugar and add 1 tsp molasses. I may add some ground sumac, and ground mustard, too. \nThose of you with dry sausage may have a couple of problems:\nUsing ground turkey *breast*. There isn't enough fat to keep the sausage moist. Add some oil, or softened butter, and you'll be back in business!\nGiving in to the temptation to squish the patties down while cooking. Never do that, with any kind of party! If it's not flat enough then fix that in the forming stage, not the cooking stage. It squeezes all the juices into the pan :-(\nOr you could be simply overcooking it. Make sure you keep an eye on these, and use a timer if you have to. I have two little kids, so timers are common here!",
