You should prepare the pan were you are going to bake the flan (caramelized) and in the blender mix the rest of the ingredients.  Pour the mix over caramelized pan and bake.  It took a litle more than one hour, but is is worth it.  It is delicious!!!",

I bought mango pulp that comes frozen (Goya brand carries many fruits this way) and it was about 1- 1/2 cups of fruit rather than 2 cups. Other than that, I followed the recipe for the flan including the rum. I do make my caramel differently. Over the years I've found that making it in the microwave in a Pyrex glass measuring cup is way easier.  Add 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup water to the Pyrex dish and heat on high until it turns an amber color. Do not let it get too dark or it will taste burnt. This usually takes about 7-10 minutes. Pour that caramel in your pan and distribute it evenly in the bottom and sides of the pan. Do it fast as it will harden, but that's ok. I added all the flan ingredients in a blender and mixed them up there to create a smoother consistency. Then I poured the mix in the pan that had the caramel. I did the Bain Marie as indicated but had to bake longer than 45 minutes for it to set. It took about 60-70 minutes instead. Cool down, put in refrigerator and flip on to a platter when ready to serve. It looks gorgeous!!",

Flan is more of a custard than a pudding. Important note!! This (and all Flan) recipe is mediocre at best if served warm fresh out of the oven. Make sure you chill it at least one day in the fridge before serving and you will have everyone asking for seconds. I switched the rum for Amaretto and used key lime juice instead of lemon juice. Also I used much less sugar for the caramel than it calls for and it turned out great.",
