I made it for the 4th of July and luckily it was just family who tried it as I honestly would have been embarassed to serve it to guests. No one wanted another piece or to take any home so I'll end up throwing what is left away. I read other reviewers comments prior to making it so made sure I increased and made larger holes but it still was very dry and tasteless. I would recommend making more liquid as there seems to be an insufficent amount of liquid topping for the size of the cake. If making this for company I'd recommend giving it a trial one on yourself first to be on the safe side.",

Two words of caution; 1. make sure you grease the pan thoroughly including the top. Mine was so fluffy that it actually rose above the top of the pan and stuck. 2. Make sure you have plenty of clearance in your oven for it to rise. I have one of those stoves with the double ovens and mistakingly used the small one on top. Not a good idea! (Was baking bread in the big oven) All in all a winner. I will definately make this again!",
