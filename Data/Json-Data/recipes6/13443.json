The crust is so good you can't have too much of it! I tried the recipe once with 1 chocolate and 1 vanilla pudding and again with 2 chocolate puddings both were yummy. Also instead of chocolate shavings on top I just set aside a few chopped nuts and sprinkle those on top. You can't go wrong with this recipe!",

For one the crust could in no way cover a 9x13 pan no matter how hard I tried, so I moved it to a 8x8 pan and it was perfect, but I like a little thickness to my crust, especially this one as it is like a shortbread. The other thing was not to put whip cream in the cream cheese mixture because it really dilutes the flavor. Also, if you toast the nuts before adding them to the crust really makes a difference. Excellent end result!!!",

The only difference is that instead of a chocolate garnish we to toasted coconut, it's really yummy. Also our crust is slightly different: 1 c. Flour, 1 c. Nuts, and 1/2 c. melted butter. melting the butter makes it much easier to press into the pan! Just reduce the baking time to 15 minutes to compensate.",
