I was going to frost it with Rick's Buttercream but with the lack of chocolate I changed direction and put a french silk frosting on it. I also think the method was a bit off and I should have followed my own instincts. The fats should be creamed and then the dry and the buttermilk should be added alternately till blended. The resulting chocolate cake was pale and looked like a beige colored cake. I think it needed 1 more oz of chocolate too. Thanks for sharing.",

Didn't have quite enough coconut - maybe 3/4 cup which was plenty - but it came out very well. I tossed in a little more chocolate because we're a family of chocoholics and frosted it with chocolate buttercream. Will make this again!",
