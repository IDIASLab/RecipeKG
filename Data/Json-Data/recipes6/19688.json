I made this in my Ninja blender and I didn't have any issues with it being \"bits\" of apple in milk. It was smooth and even frothy on top. I liked it okay and my 2 year old loved it. However then I put it back in the blender and added about 9 oz of vanilla yogurt. Now that was what it needed to give it some \"depth.\" I'll make it that way again.",
