For those who think the layers do not go together, please note that after these have refrigerated thoroughly to set up, let the bars come to room temperature before eating.  The top chocolate layer should soften slightly to the touch.  These are very rich, but they will melt in your mouth. Every time I have made them I am asked for the recipe.  I have had more success by baking these in a standard 13 x 9 pan instead of using a jelly roll. This is because the bottom cake layer yields a small amount and will be very thin in the jelly roll pan, and too easy to over bake.  Be sure NOT to over bake the cake layer, remove before the edges become too crisp. To make this easier and for a smoother middle layer, use a jar of marshmallow creme instead of regular marshmallows. Enjoy! :)",

I did have to bake the cake layer about 5 minutes longer than specified. Also if you keep the bars in the oven the full 3 minutes to soften the mini marshmallows it is no problem to spread them. It doesn't have to be perfectly smooth either so don't worry about how it looks because when you spread on the choc/pb layer it covers up any imperfections. It takes quite awhile for the bars to set up in the fridge but once they are firm they cut into beautiful squares. this recipe is fairly time consuming but worth the extra effort. I was able to get 48 1\" (approx)squares from the recipe using a 13x9\" pan.",
