I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect as is and I even live in high altitude. I didn't have any problems with it setting or anything else. The step where you mix the egg yolks separately in a bow is necessary so that the eggs don't cook when you add them to the hot chocolate mixture, if they cook as you add them then you will have lumps of egg yolks in your filling. Having them in a bowl and adding some of the chocolate mixture to them slowly takes the temp down a bit so this doesn\u2019t happen.",

Everything else followed exactly --and nope the Saran Wrap doesn't stick cool huh? Pie set for 24 hours in the fridge but still came out loose (we even used whole milk). Consistency of thick pudding -- excellent tasting pudding mind you but not quite thick enough to truly be a great cream pie. We'd cut a slice put it on a plate and it'd would blob into a gooey puddle that looked like pudding as soon as your fork hit it. Big no no for a pie. I may try this again and add a little more corn starch to see if that firms things up. I'm not a fan of pudding pies - pudding is good just not in a pie shell. If you dig instant pudding pies are content with that sort of gooey consistency and are looking to get a bit fancier than ripping open a box and dumping some milk in you may really dig this recipe. If you're not a pudding pie type this probably won't be for you. If you're just looking for a great rich pudding this is a great recipe sans the pie shell!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great base recipe, but it needs a couple changes in order to make it perfect.  First of all, DO NOT use chocolate chips.  Chocolate chips contain ingredients that can cause items to be soft-set.  Instead, I substituted 6 oz. semi sweet chocolate and then the 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate already called for in the recipe.  I suggest using whole milk simply because it will yield the best results, but I'm sure you could sub. lower fat milk and it turn out just fine.  I also used a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the normal pie crust.  Once your milk/chocolate mixture gets warm, temper it into your eggs.  This essentially means to whisk constantly to ensure the eggs don't curdle.  Add that mixture back to the pot, and whisk constantly until it boils.  You want it to boil for a good minute and make sure you whisk during that minute.  Pour into a pie shell, cover with plastic wrap and chill.  For those who complained about it being lumpy, it could be you didn't temper the eggs correctly and you're tasting pieces of egg.  If it's grainy, you likely didn't cook it long enough and you're still tasting the cornstarch.  I'm sure using a store-brand chocolate chip can also yield lumpy results because they just don't melt the way toll house does.",
