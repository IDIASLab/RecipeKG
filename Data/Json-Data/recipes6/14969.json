Tomato Florentine soup is not the same thing as plain Tomato soup and usually I like Tomato Florentine broth a bit thinner and more seasoned. My husband enjoyed it but I think if I were to make this again I would cut back on some of the tomato ingredients (most likely the paste) and add more chicken stock for flavor and consistency. I would also recommend adding some of your favorite soup seasonings to spice it up a bit. Not a bad soup just nothing amazing.",

Well I had no Campbells and was craving grilled cheese w/ tomato soup so here I am. The baby & I both enjoyed this for lunch today. It was great because I usually add pasta to his anyway (so that it is easier for him to eat) and he didn't seem to notice the veges so that was a plus as well! I cut the recipe to 2 servings so I skipped the tomato juice & paste BUT I used 1 can of Rold Gold \"thick & rich tomato sauce\" (which by the way is REALLY thick so it made up for the juice & paste). Next time I will leave out the carrots I wasn't to fond of the taste they brought on. Good soup I will use this again for sure! Thanks Karen!",

Broth was too thick vegetables not cooked enough even though I added water seasoning and cooked for much longer than called for in the hopes of a pleasant soup! I even held off adding the pasta with my former experiences of knowing that pasta breaks down if left to simmer in soup too long. With complete respect to the receipe submitter I question the ingredients and the method to this soup!",
