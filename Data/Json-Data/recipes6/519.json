Of course, I took up the challenge when he asked and was able to come up with this recipe. He states that he's never seen his mom take two helpings of dessert and that its taste and texture is perfect. The pie crust is my mom's recipe. This is a very sweet pie and I have found that a good quality maple syrup is essential. You can also add raisins or currants for a little bit of a switch-up!",
