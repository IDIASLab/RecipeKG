Since the spice rub had cardamon, I served the pork with Sauteed Apples (also on Allrecipes.com) to compliment the sweetness in the rub.  I was more than happy with my choice - it was a GREAT combination!  We didn't grill the pork, but baked it at 500 for 20 minutes to seal in the juices, then at 350 until it hit 160 degrees.  Yum, yum, yum!",

I grilled it with indirect heat for about 20 minutes until it reached an internal temperature of 155. I then pulled it off the grill and lightly tented it with tinfoil and allowed it to rest for five minutes. This allowed the internal cooking to finish nicely. My husband and I loved the flavor. The cardamom and cumin were present but not overpowering. Next time I will decrease the salt though. We both love salt but thought it was too much for the smaller roast. This will be a staple in our household for years to come. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

I prefer my pork a little more medium than well (and everything is dead above 140 anyways). Served with the apples and onions from the apple and onion pork chops from this site with roasted potatoes.
