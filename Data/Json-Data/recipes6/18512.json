The graham crust was delicious - I plan on using it with other fillings. The topping turned out rubbery for me but again I was rushing and may not have beaten the egg whites long enough. Next time I would skip that and just put the remaining crumbs directly on top of the pudding. The flavour was subtle and sweet - good desert for a heave meal.",
