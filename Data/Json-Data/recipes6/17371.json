I made mine alittle diff. because I didn't have some things on hand.  I used oil instead of butter(I'm sure butter makes it better.) I omitted the lemon extract for 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1 TBL of good van.(That's what gives pound cake the traditional lb.cake flavor.)  Also, I only had french vanilla cake mix.  I also used buttermilk instead of the 2/3c of water.  You have to make this cake a day ahead to appreciate it.  Do not eat it warm because it still tastes like cake mix.  Trust me, next day!!  I also wouldn't ice it or glaze it unless you like you cake super sweet.  We found it was wonderful with a cup of coffee.  This would make a great base for s.c coffee cake.  I think I will use this as my new lb. cake recipe-because it is so easy.  However, next time, I will use butter and butter cake mix.  I think that prob. makes it!  You can still use oil- it was still great! Just use butter flavored cake mix.",

The BUTTER yellow cake mix makes a better cake than just the regular yellow cake mix. I have experimented a lot with this recipe and it is very versatile.  As a pound cake, I top it with any type of icing. It also makes a great sheet cake.  I use this same recipe to make chocolate sour cream pound cake, using Duncan Hines BUTTER chocolate cake mix , eliminating the lemon flavor and adding more vanilla. Top with chocolate or white buttercream icing.",

No matter that this recipe doctors up a cake mix nearly to the point of its being a scratch cake; it tasted like, well, a yellow cake mix - a dry, yellow cake mix. Better to have skipped the cake mix altogether, since all the rest of the ingredients for a pound cake were there. In addition, the baking instructions state 60-80 minutes - mine was a tad over baked at 55 minutes. As previous reviewers remarked, this has a coarse crumb, and is not nearly as moist as it should have been. My suggestion, if you are a fan of yellow cake mixes to begin with, is to simply bake a yellow cake mix according to package directions, or look for a doctored cake mix recipe that includes sour cream and pudding. Otherwise, skip the cake mix and make a scratch pound cake.",
