I used fresh raw corn (8 ears) and 1/2 clove garlic plus 1/4 tsp sea salt instead of garlic salt. The only change I'd recommend is to cut back on the olive oil--I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty (just make sure you adjust the lime juice and cider vinegar accordingly so it's not too sour--I eyeballed it and then added a drizzle of juice from the pimentos). I only had about an hour to let it marinate and that was just fine.",

I deleted the zucchini and opted for a couple each of sweet orange and red peppers for more color. Added a small amount of Cilantro and used a can of black seasoned beans rinsed and drained. It is delicious. Going to try Dill next time because some of the family does not care for the Cilantro. Will definitely make this salad alot.",
