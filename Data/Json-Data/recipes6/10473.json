I also reduced the oven temp to 325 as well as cooking time. Larger muffins 35 minutes smaller muffins 25 minutes. I left out the dates (didn't have them). I used organic crazins (dried cranberries) for the add-in. I only used a handful of chopped nuts (daughter not fond of them). The orange flavor is a great addition to this muffin. I will definately make these again!",

Instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar I used 1 c white sugar 1/2 c brown sugar. I omitted the orange zest because I didn't have any and am glad I did because I wanted the pumpkin flavor really to shine. For the cinnamon and cloves I just added an equal amount of Chinese 5 spice powder. And for the walnuts and dates I added an equal amount of raisins and fresh cranberries. Mmm this bread was so delicious! I don't know if it has anything to do with elevation and where this recipe orginated but my bread took any extra 12 minutes to bake. I live outside Athens GA which isn't below sea level or at a high elevation. GREAT BREAD!",

So I used freshly baked pumpkin instead of canned used Splenda for the sugar and increased the orange zest to 3 Tablespoons. The orange accent is a perfect match for pumpkin recipes. I will be preparing many mini-loaves of this bread for the freezer to enjoy through the winter months. Thanks for the recipe Carol.",
