I followed it but mixed my shortening & sugar then put in my eggs mixed and then the rest of the ingredients only adding flour a cup at a time. Because some said it was dry I added an extra tbsp of milk and this dough was perfect for a roll out cookie. I only left it in the fridge for 2 hours bec I was short on time. If you were mixing the dough and see it was getting crumbly why would you continue to add flour? I stopped at 3 cups. The taste for a plain sugar cookie is comparable to other recipes. I also used butter flavored crisco. I think you should give this recipe a second chance.",
