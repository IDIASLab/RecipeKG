I have never been a fan of scones since I always felt they were too dry but this recipe has changed my thought on that! I substituted white chocolate chips for the hugs since it is what I had on hand. I melted them with one teaspoon of butter and gradually added the sour cream mixture to the melted chocolate. I increased the lemon zest to 1 tablespoon. In place of the cinnamon chips I chopped 1/2 cup of pecans and placed in small bowl with 1 teaspoon of butter and then sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon mix well before microwaving for 30 seconds. Mix again and cool slightly before adding to partially mixed dough. The secret is to not overmix the dough or the scones will be tough instead of moist and tender. I cut the dough into eight scones brushed with the cream and then sprinkled with raw sugar for an added crunch and baked for 20 minutes Do not overbake. For the topping I melted 1 cup of white chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon of butter and the juice of 1/2 lemon. I added 1/2 cup of powder sugar and enough milk to obtain the right consistency frosting hardened nicely on scones. The lemon flavor with the chocolate is a nice combination. Wonderful recipe!",
