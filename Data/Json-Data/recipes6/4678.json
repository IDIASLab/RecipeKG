Since several people noted that it was rather bland I kicked up the spices adding turmeric and paprika along with 1/2 a head of garlic.

To give it a little extra flavor I did 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper a dash more of the turmeric 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/2 teaspoon extra of the minced garlic. By doing that I think it brought out more flavor without having to go overboard in anything. It was excellent. Super delicious and healthy vegetarian dish that's rich in flavor.",
