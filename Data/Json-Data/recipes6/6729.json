And don't go for the super lean turkey. You'll want a little bit of fat to make them juicy. Top with your favorite cheese and garnishes. Serve on your choice of bun or lettuce wrap and enjoy.",

Next time, I will try a non-stick skillet and maybe slightly less mayo, or a bit of bread crumbs to help bind them together better. I also had to cook them longer to get to an internal temperature of 165 degrees. We topped ours with sriracha-mayo and guacamole. Overall, a nice, flavorful burger recipe, and one that I'll make again. Thanks for the recipe!",
