I added two boneless/skinless chicken thighs (diced which I cooked with frozen black eyed peas instead of canned then I rinsed the black eyes peas and chicken). This would also work with pre-cooked/grilled chicken breast. I also added avocado and sweet corn. I cut the sugar in half but it was still a little too sweet for me - next time I would use either sweet corn or sugar but not both. To cut the sweetness and add spice (I didn't have any jalapenos on hand) I added about 1 tsp of hot sauce some red pepper flakes and I squeezed some lime juice just before serving. This was yummy and a beautiful colorful presentation for an outdoor summer/spring evening dinner! I also made a kid-friendly batch with no onion garlic or peppers which 2 out of 3 of my kids enjoyed.",
