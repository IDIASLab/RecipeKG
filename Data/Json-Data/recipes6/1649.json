                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe, especially if you like to tweak recipes, like I do.  \n\nHere's what I did:\nFirst, I grated my zucchini (peel on), then dried it really well in a tea towel.  Next, I mixed up my PP Spice, which is 4 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  \n\nI doubled the recipe, using 2 cups unbleached white flour, and 1 cup of oats, which I measured and packed, then ground in my mini food chopper; I didn't grind to a flour, but almost.  I whisked grapeseed oil, 1 tbsp. vanilla, and the 4 eggs together, then dumped in a 15oz. can of pumpkin puree and blended.  I whisked the dry ingredients, then dumped them into the wet and gently folded until no more dry flour was seen.  I then folded in the zucchini, 1 cup chopped pecans, and 1 cup craisins.  \n\nI baked them in a stone muffin pan which I preheated in the oven, let cool slightly, then sprayed with oil- I did not use liners.  I baked, turning the pan 180 degrees halfway through, until there were just a few crumbs on the toothpick.  I ran a knife around the edges, then dumped the muffins on the counter.  Do not do this- they  are very delicate.  Definitely let them cool a little in the pan if you can- I can't with a stone pan, or they'll over-bake.\n\nThe texture is amazing- very light and delicate, and the flavor is perfect- not too little, not too much.  They are also super moist.  By doubling the batch, I got exactly 24 muffins, and plan to freeze half of them.",

I followed the conversion instructions on the bottle but the pumpkin pie flavor was a little strong for me. However that may be a result of using the liquid version. These are not super sweet. I'd probably prefer a little more sweetness but that would detract from the healthy idea of the muffins. Nice way to sneak some veggies into my picky toddler.",
