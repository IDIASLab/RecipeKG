I use olive oil instead of butter, fresh oregano from my garden chopped instead of parsley, 2 t. garlic cloves crushed instead of powder, and splenda instead of sugar.  I put almost everything in the warm water first than the flour than the oregano and yeast go on top.  The taste with these changes is excellant.  (I tried it to the letter first and didn't like it.)  If you find the bread doesn't raise very much just use the \"scale this recipe\" to adjust it.  I find that 16-18 servings uses my 2lb. machine to capacity better than leaving it at 12 (the original setting on the recipe.)  Good luck!  ~jllebow",

                "reviewBody": "Overall, I'd say this recipe was very good, though I did take the advice of other reviewers and ended up modifying mine somewhat.  First of all, I omitted garlic powder altogether and instead used three pounded cloves of fresh garlic-- you can most definately taste the garlic, but it is not overpowering.  I also did not have any powdered milk, so I used 1/4th cup of condensed milk-- I think adding actual liquid instead of powdered milk improves this bread because others have complained of it being too dry.  I added 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp rosemary, and used vegetable oil instead of butter.  I always hate the look of bread baked in a bread machine, so I set my machine for a dough cycle and finished the bread in the oven.  When the dough cycle was completed, the bread had not risen very much at all even though the yeast was fresh.  I turned the dough out onto a cookie sheet, covered and let rise for another half hour, then baked at 300 degrees for about 50 mins, brushing the top of the loaf with more oil before baking and again halfway through.  When it was done, the bread was VERY soft and dense, the crust was perfection.  I had friends over, and the entire loaf was eaten by us with just butter.  Everyone loved it!  I will be making another loaf tomorrow :).",

But i find the amount of garlic powder in the recipe doesnt give it enough of a garlic flavor.",
