At 30 minutes it was still really jiggly and at 35 minutes my knife came out totally batter coated. I ended up baking them for about 45 minutes. The insides were very moist but the top and sides came out very hard and as a result crumbled when I cut them. Nevertheless they tasted great and the kids loved them.",

We use about 1/2 to 2/3 of the Nestle bag depending on how rich you want them. Every time comes out perfect...never too sweet. YUM!",

A couple of good brownie techniques also make these a standout: 1. Toast the walnuts first. 2. Add in about 1/2 tsp salt and maybe 1 tsp espresso powder/instant coffee to pick up the flavor. (This may also help the person who thought they were too sweet.) A DEFINITE make-again.",
