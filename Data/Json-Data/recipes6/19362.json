I only used beef neck bones for a nice clear broth. I didn't use the radish.  In cheese cloth I used Anise seed, ground cinnamon, ground peppercorns, and a lot more cloves. I about doubled all the spices as I'm used to very aromatic pho. I added the tablespoon of fish sauce and sugar and simmered for the 6 hours. Paper thin sirloin was great! Loaded it with only cilantro and green onions and noodles just like in Hanoi and this dish was delish! Thank you for such a great recipe to play with!",

                "reviewBody": "This was my first time making pho and it was really good! BUTTTT I have some recommendations that I think will make a load of difference. My soup didn't really have the \"pho\" flavor entirely, so I had put some \"pho beef flavor\" bullions into my pho. I just added one cube at a time to taste. That really brought out the pho flavor. (and these cubes are super cheap! 79 cents :) !!!) I also took my onions, cut them in half, wrapped them in foil, and put it on the stove to cook them a bit. Also, I ended up finding a packet of \"pho seasoning\" that had star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and other ingredients in there so I got that instead. It came with a seasoning bag too that you can throw right into the soup base. I also used an extra slice of ginger. Also, I could not find beef knuckle, so a nice vietnamese lady told me to get beef bones instead and it worked out great. Oh and you MUST get the fresh noodles that come in the regridgerator section, this will make a HUGE difference in the taste of your noodles. I originally bought the dried flat pho noodles and I did not like them at all. My boyfriend (who is vietnamese) told me to get the fresh ones from the cold section and those were like the ones you get from the store. =) Hope my review helps some folks! =)",

I have made pho before (even using the predone cube sachets and beef broth to try to spice it up) and it has turned out miserable and tasteless.

I used some large meaty bones from the butcher at the local asian market and they were perfect for a half sized recipe. I followed everything else to a \"T\" and it was well worth the 6 1/2 hours it took the broth to cook and it smelled wonderful (after I added the spices). Even my picky roommate loved it!

Good pho is all about the broth - it should be rich but light meaty but fragrant; crumbling a beef bouillon cube into some hot water and tossing in a sliced onion isn't going to cut it! Personally I omit the oxtail because they're just too expensive and I use whatever meaty beef bones I can get at the store. Like any good stock the key is simmering it slowly for as long as you can - I aim for 3 or 4 hours. I personally don't make it with daikon but I don't think regular radish would be a bad substitute. You can't beat pho from a genuine Vietnamese restaurant but this is a decent recipe to satisfy a craving! Thanks!",
