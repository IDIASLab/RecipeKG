I browned the meat, onions and garlic together & then drained. I tossed in the remaining ingredients in IP. I added a can of tomato paste bc I mistakenly opened that instead of the tomato sauce so I added both so it wouldn\u2019t get wasted. I tossed in a can of rotel also bc it felt wrong making this without some type of tomato pieces. I added fresh carrots & potatoes but frozen green beans and corn. Frozen veggies tend to work better for pressure cooking so they don\u2019t get too mushy. The corn isn\u2019t in the recipe but my kids LOVE it so I tossed in about a cup. I did a 7 minute cook and a 15 minute natural release. The veggies definitely weren\u2019t mush but next time I\u2019ll probably cook for 5 minutes instead so they will be a little firmer. I added the flour mixture after cooking it. I got lots of compliments from my picky eaters.",
