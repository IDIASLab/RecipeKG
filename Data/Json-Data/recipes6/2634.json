I like a little heat in my food but my husband does not, so I omitted the chili peppers and I don't use peanut oil so that was left out as well. There was enough heat in the red curry paste to add some zing, but even my husband didn't mind because the taste was so amazing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. To make sure I got all of the browned bits out of my frying pan, I deglazed it using the beef broth and added that to the pot as well. I would also recommend breaking up the beef once it's cooked to a more \"shredded\" consistency. That's easy because it's falling apart anyway! That way you can incorporate more of the sauce as you spoon it over the rice. \nWe liked this so much that I have just finished putting all the ingredients in the pot to serve to dinner guests this evening. \nI was frustrated trying to find a recipe for beef that was not a stew or pot roast. This turned out better than I had expected and will now be my \"go to\" meal when I want to serve something especially good and a little different. Thank you for the recipe!",

My husband and I love Thai food and eating out, so this recipe seemed great because it was simple. This is nothing like what you'd get at a Thai restaurant. It was pretty bland and not really flavorful at all (I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste). This is more like something my mother-in-law from the midwest would consider an exotic Thai dish. It tasted fine overall and was edible, but I wouldn't call it Thai. This would require major tweaking for me to make again.",

It did not take the full amount of time recommended .   Only about six hours on though he in the crockpot .     I did not add any hot spicy things like jalape\u00f1os and I dumped in more brown sugar then was recommended .      I dredged the beef in a combination of flour curry and salt  and five Chinese spice blend before Browning .      My beef teriyaki was plenty thick and super savory .       I ended up watering it down significantly to get the right. Consistency .   Since I don't have coconut milk I used extra beef broth and a half cup of old shredded coconut I found in my baking cupboard.  It seemed the other three reviews mentioned that the flavor was not as strong as they would like and that it was too watery so I added Chinese five spice and a lot of curry powder instead of curry paste because I don't have any curry paste Also I will use lemon juice because I don't have lime.               I should add that I had no peanut oil and just used canola. This was so amazing I doubled the recipe and I'm very happy that I did.",

It was amazing. Next time I might try cooking the meat in corn starch as a previous commenter suggested and see if that doesn't thicken it while it cooks so I don't have to add the slurry at the end.
