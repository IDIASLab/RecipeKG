In other words, you need to spread it on carefully and make NO corners or edges are left out where the jello layer can seep in.  If your pretzels turned out soggy (mine did the first time i did this recipe), you didn't spread the cream cheese/Cool Whip on properly.  When it comes out right (with crunchy pretzels), this recipe is delicious!",

One tip -- if you buy the larger container of whipped topping you can spread that on top of the strawberries for and extra layer. AND if you're feeling even more adventerous slice fresh strawberries on top. NOTES: 1. cut the water back to 1 cup -- the frozen strawberries will add the extra water. Otherwise your gelitan will be too soft. 2. make sure you seal pretzel crust with the cream cheese / whipped topping layer. Otherwise the liquid will seep into the pretzel layer and make it soggy.",

I do the jello/frozen fruit layer differently however....I pour the package of jello into a bowl and add 1 cup of boiling water to it. Then I use the quick set method on the side of the jello box by adding 1 1/2 cups of ice water to the jello and refridgerate for about 20 minutes then I add the frozen strawberries/raspberries. I wait until the jello is half set before pouring it over the well-sealed cream cheese mixture. I hope this helps some of you - I've never had my pretzel layer get soggy this way.",

Ive made a different version of this...The final product itself though (when done right) is awesome! I just think that there are some mistakes on the directions themselves. These are the changes I made: 1 cup melted butter rather than margarine 1 1/2 packages (16oz) frozen whole strawberries thawed 1 plus 1 partial (6oz) package strawberry gelatin I started the jello right away since I knew that it would need to PARTIALLY Set in the refridgerator while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. I did use the 2 cups of boiling water but I also added about 1/4 of the 2nd package of jello to ensure it sets correctly. Once I added the strawberries (which were mostly thawed I used a potato masher to crush them a bit). I transfered the entire saucepan of jello into the fridge and began the next steps. It is also very important to complete the baking process as well as sealing off the entire layer of pretzels to prevent the jello from seeping into the pretzel. HOWEVER the seeping wont be much of an issue if the jello is partially set (like jelly/jam texture almost) and the cream cheese layer is well chilled after you layer it. Pour jello over cream cheese layer and chill at least a few more hours to set properly. The directions make it seem like this is a fast quick step process. But each step takes time in between for setting chilling and setting!",
