They walked into the kitchen as I was preparing it and had to leave because of the cooking aroma. They also found it too sweet even though I cut the sugar by half as other reviewers suggested. Other than the sugar, I followed the recipe exactly as written. Unfortunately when I open my instant pot and inserted my meat thermometer, the pork was nowhere near cooked (was 32C instead of needed 65-70C). So, with no other option I had to close the pot, and pressure cook it a second time as instructed in the recipe. Although the pork came out somewhat juicy, it was tough. Pork loin is one of my family\u2019s favourite meats, but not done this way. Sorry.",
