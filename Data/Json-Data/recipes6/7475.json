        "description": "This dish started after the Korean War when food was in short supply. Canned ham, hot dogs, and beans were taken from American military bases and mixed with traditional Korean kimchi, vegetables, noodles, and spicy seasonings to create a delicious spicy and hearty stew. I first had this dish in a Korean restaurant near my home. It was so good that I went on a quest to figure out how to make it for myself. My version is pretty traditional and fairly spicy. Find a Korean/Asian market for the kimchi, pepper paste, and powder. It is worth it.",

I also added a bit more Gochujang and Korean pepper powder. \nAnd, lets be real, I used the noodles from Cup O Noodles.",

I could not find the Korean red pepper powder or the red chili paste so I substituted Cayenne pepper and Indonesian Sambal sauce so mine wasn\u2019t authentic but it was good. I used three different types of leftover sausage that I had in the fridge and that was kind of useful. Next time I may add more kimchi and cube the Spam before putting it in the pot.
