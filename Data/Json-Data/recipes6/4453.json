                "reviewBody": "A tasty dish. The trick is to have everything hot at once so my advice is to make the pesto first. Then start the barley. I used Penne Rigate Pasta and put it into the prepared water when the barley had 11 minutes left to cook; exactly as long as the pasta took to be al dente. During those 11 minutes I recommend transferring the pesto to a microwave safe dish and heating it just before pouring it over the cooked pasta and barley. Last of all add arugula and tomato halves. I could not find arugula so baby spinach leaves worked perfectly. I forgot to read the reviews before making but think the lemon juice might be a good addition. If you have a meat lover some cooked hot turkey sausage in slices is another idea although it kills the calories and the vegetarian presentation. Don't hesitate to try this one. It is a keeper!",
