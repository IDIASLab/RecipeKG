All the guys at work raved about it, and suprisingly, they could even taste the apple. I did modify this recipe slightly, using a 4 lb pork roast/loin (cut into about 6 slices) and used 1 1/2 apples. The apple did reduce the \"zing\" from the sauerkraut. I like the \"zing\", so maybe next time I would probably only use the 1/2 apple that it called for. Otherwise, it cooked up great-meat was tender, and I served it like everyone else seems to, with mashed potatoes and applesauce. Oh, also, I used the sauerkraut that somes refridgerated in a bag, found it back in the meat dept.",

I used a bottle of Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic and that made for a wonderful tasting roast. If your roast came out dry my suggestion would be to use the entire 12 oz. of beer otherwise there will not be enough liquid hence the dry roast. Good recipe Bianca served with mashed potatoes & applesauce as suggested = yum. Thanks! (Hi Manda the point of the apple is to take the tart out of the sauerkraut. Happy Cooking better luck next time;)",

I didn't cube the roast either I just cut two long slits lengthwise and stuffed them with sauerkraut then broke broke the roast up as it cooked.
