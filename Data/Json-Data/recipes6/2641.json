Recipe is awesome, but I found out rather quickly that I am not a cold uncooked oatmeal fan. Second time: Prepared again with old fashioned (not quick) oatmeal (same as before) and the changes I made were to use a brown sugar blend and unsweetened almond milk. The next morning, I poured this into a microwavable bowl, stirred in an additional  1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk and cook for 3-4 minutes, removed and topped with another 1/4 unsweetened almond milk and added Stevia, to taste. NOW we are in business!!! I definitely will make this again and again, but not as a grab and go breakfast.",

Not too sweet and just the right amount of seasoning. I did add 2 tsp slivered almonds to it also and the extra crunch was worth it. This was actually about 2 servings too, I couldn't eat it all in one sitting. Very good and worth making!",

As with the previous reviewer I know now I am not a fan of uncooked oatmeal. I heated it up in the microwave and it was marginally better after adding more milk and some extra sugar. I thought the amount of spices was a bit over- powering in particular the ginger. FYI rather than make up all that spice mix and potentially have it sit around for who knows how long here are the ingredients for one serving: 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon ginger and allspice and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and cloves. Personally I would cut the ginger to 1/8tsp also if I was to make this again.",
