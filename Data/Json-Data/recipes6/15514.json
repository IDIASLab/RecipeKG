I ended up adding more buttermilk and some dried dill weed.

This is one of those recipes that's SO dependent on \"seasoning to taste\" and it's so easy to adjust that! If you like more or less of something just do it and please your own tastebuds! In my case I basically flip-flopped the amounts of buttermilk and mayo and added a little sour cream - nothing drastic but it worked better for me. I eliminated the sugar not because it shouldn't be there but because it's my preference. I also added a little garlic powder and some fresh dill - again not because the recipe necessarily needed it but because I wanted it. This is a good start for what will be a great dressing if you just tweak it to suit you. We loved it with my changes. Make this with YOUR preferences till you get it just right and you'll love it too!",
