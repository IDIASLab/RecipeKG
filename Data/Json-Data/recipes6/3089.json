Changes: Sadly I could not get to the store and had to use Sriracha and a shake of red pepper flakes instead of the gochujang paste. I also used dried thyme. The big change however was serving these as tacos with small flour tortillas sriracha mayo thinly sliced radish chopped green onion chopped purple cabbage chopped cilantro and fresh squeezed lime juice. It was very colorful and easy to make. Will definitely make again!",
