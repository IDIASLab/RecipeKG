This one makes cream by blending cashews with broth. If not told beforehand many people eating this soup would not identify cashews being used as the taste is surprisingly subtle. Perhaps it shouldn t be surprising as almond or soy milk might work fine here if subbed for cashew cream. For us this soup seriously needed seasoning. Having made that adjustment it was pretty good but more tinkering is needed to take this up a notch... like a glug of dry white wine. Overall a healthy choice but we used a low sodium broth and omitted the salt given the relative high sodium content for just one bowl of soup. Nakkeya thank you for creating this recipe.",
