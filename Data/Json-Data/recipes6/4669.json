My son has severe food allergies and cannot have any dairy or egg - so I created this to satisfy his craving for soup!  I make it a point to create recipes for him that the rest of the family is also thrilled to eat and this definitely meets that criteria. It tastes a little more broth-like than traditional chowders, but was very comforting nonetheless.",

Or you can always use hand blender too. I used only 1 tbs of parsley, 1 no-salt vegan bouillon instead of broth, added couple cloves of fresh garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1/16 tsp of cayenne, 2 stalks of celery (chopped), 1 tsp of Old Bay and only used 1/2 tsp of salt.

I agree with the author that it does have a more...creamy broth taste as opposed to a full out cream taste but I appreciated that as I'm not the biggest fan of cream soups. Definitely worth a try!
