After the pie was chilled I poured a chocolate ganache over the top (simply whipping cream melted with chocolate). I decorated the top with a circle of small peanut butter cups. So easy especially for a cheesecake. The second one I made I poured caramel on the bottom of the pie and blended chocolate chips and pecans. So it was a Turtle version.",

I cooled it on the counter a few hours before putting it in the fridge to cool completely. It turned out just as I hoped!
