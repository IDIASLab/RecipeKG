I did make a couple substitutions: instead of sugar and hot sauce I added about 1/3 cup ketchup and chili pepper flakes I also didn't have wine in the house so skipped that. I did add the corn but will probably go with garbanzo beans next time to cut down the sweetness. I forgot to add the parmesan probably because it tasted so good I didn't think it needed anything else. I'm already excited for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!",
