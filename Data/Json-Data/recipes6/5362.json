Wasn't sure if I'd like lemon soup so I customized it with a few tweaks - added ginger and fenugreek in the beginning but turns out coriander is the best flavor. I loved the cashew cream but also stirred in two tempered beaten egg yolks. I also used collard greens rather than spinach which take longer to cook so my lentils dissolved. This is a great kitchen sink soup so next time I'll add sweet potato rather than the regular potato I tried.",
