They are small, one bite, and I expected (and would like) a little larger cookie, so I would use tablespoon size instead of teaspoon in the future.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a little orange extract to the glaze since I could taste no orange flavor at all.  These cookies are somewhat rustic-looking, and the cranberries and the cashews give them a slightly chewy texture.  These may not be the prettiest cookies I\u2019ve ever made, but they are tasty.",
