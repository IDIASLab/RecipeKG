It's almost like a flavorless sugar cookie that doesn't have enough sugar in it. I followed the instructions with the exception of sprinkling a little bit of sugar on the top for decoration. The dough is very sticky I knew it would be a plain cookie and I didn't want to change it by using more flour so I used a cookie scoop to portion it on the cookie sheet and then used the bottom of a lightly floured glass to flatten it. It's just really boring and the best thing I can say is that it makes a pretty cookie. Maybe better with frosting. Sorry.",
