I lightly smoked one all day in an electric smoker and came out awesome.  I placed the rest of the  marinade in a cup and basted it several times during the cooking process.  I had a water pan underneath the shoulder and filled it with hot apple juice, water and white wine.  This kept the meat very moist plus it caught the juices from the meat. When basting, check the water pan and add more WARM liquid. Pull out meat at 175 Degrees. Let set for 20 min. covered with tinfoil. Very, very moist and tasty. Used BBQ sauce on this one.  The oven one was a little dry and didn't retain the flavor of the smoked one. Same for the oven one. let stand for 20 min covered then slice. We used the juices from the oven one and heated it up in a pan added a 1/2 cup of Chardonney Wine and a little corn starch to thicken it . Made a great gravey for the oven pork shoulder.",

I figured I'd just try it anyway to see if it still works. I put the marinade in an iron skillet and cooked it medium heat till bubbly, then I put the meat in the skillet and seared both sides. Then put it all(covered with foil) in the oven at 400 degrees using the meat thermometer to check for doneness. I also added 2 extra onions to the marinade. I did not have any garlic to add so I doubled the amount of garlic powder. It was still very good. It was even better on sandwiches the next day. This is a keeper for sure. Thank you Glenn for this outstanding recipe!",
