I decided to leave out the serranos after tasting it with the chilies--it was plenty hot for us at that point (and we love spicy food). A note on roasting the chilies: These don't peel like roasted bell peppers; because the flesh is thinner they fall apart and it's difficult to find the edge. I found it works best to work from the inside and scrape the pepper from the peel rather than trying to pull the peel off the pepper. Also I'd suggest wearing gloves--my fingers were still burning this morning. I'm usually a snob when it comes to using fresh vs. frozen/canned but this was so time-consuming and tedious I'll try the Bueno frozen chilies next time. (And there will definitely be a next time!)",
