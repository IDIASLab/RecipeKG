I saut\u00e9ed peppers, onions, and mushrooms in butter, salt and pepper and served it over white rice!  If you like Chinese food,  YOU WILL LOVE THIS! It is so easy!

I also added a 1/2 Tbsp of molasses because I only had light brown sugar.  The steak marinated for a few hours in a glass Pyrex  Then, we transfered it to a cookie sheet to get an even cook. Make sure the sheet has depth because the marinade gets absorbed into the steak and once cooked the juices come out. Add in your favorite veggies, steamed or stir fried, and serve over rice. \n\nNext time I will try this in the wok.  The marinade and juices released when the steak is cooked are so good that you end up spooning it on your veggies anyway.  we also added Sriracha for heat.  YUMMMMY!

I cooked it on the stove top in a very hot pan and tried not to over cook the meat.\nNext time I may marinate the steak and grill it and then cut it into strips afterwards to leave it a bit rare. This was good with green beans but would also be good with snow peas and water chestnuts for some crunch.I also might try throwing in some garlic cloves next time. \n I doubled the sauce so I'd have enough and their was plenty.
