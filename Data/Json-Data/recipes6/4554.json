I may try adding a little heat with some red pepper flakes. Overall this was great!",

I had ground ginger from another recipe so I didn't buy fresh; I doubt it made a difference. It's wonderful served with harira (soup) and warm batbout (pitas).

I did however make a few changes which I think improved the dish overall: I added more vegetables - a whole yellow pepper whole red pepper both green zucchini and lots of yellow zucchini sliced leek (I had it on hand) and more mushrooms. I omitted the lemon - it's not a quite a fit for this dish if you ask me... Plus I added 2 cans of drained garbanzo beans - incredible - and now a complete meal!! Instead of instant brown rice I used some already prepared brown rice (I cook big batches and freeze it in small portions); I used about 3 1/2-4 cups of rice total to absorb the liquid - the rice is wonderful in this dish. I doubled the cumin and used ground ginger instead of fresh (I got lazy). A little pepper and (quite a bit) of salt to taste. The pineapple (I used canned instead of fresh) was my husband's favorite part.",

I used white rice I\u2019d already cooked and wanted to use up.  Had canned pineapple chunks in the pantry. I added some curry seasoning in addition to the other spices already in the recipe.  I also used a cup of chicken stock and a can of coconut milk in mine as the rice was already cooked.  I added some white pepper, and chopped fresh mint and cilantro.   For veggies I just used what I had I. The freezer with was a red and yellow pepper and onion mix, green peas, and broccoli.",
