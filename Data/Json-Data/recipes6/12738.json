Also, I usually push the peppermint patties into the first layer of mixture, then top with the rest, so they won't poke through in cooking.

I always make them in a metal 9x12 cake pan and I only put enough batter on the bottom to cover the pan (thick but less than half the batter on the bottom) -- it always seems to require more than half the batter to cover the peppermint patty layer. When in doubt undercook! You can almost never get an accurate toothpick reading because of the peppermint brownies so I generally take them out when the edges start to crisp and the middle is set when I give the pan a giggle. I also think it helps not to overbeat the batter. Too much time in the mixer or the oven will make them dry and cakey at which point they're really not worth eating. But a good gooey center underneath that crisp flaky top layer? Absolute heaven.",

The edges were burned and the patties oozed and stuck to the sides of the pan. Having said that this time I lined the long side of the pan with parchment paper sprayed the paper with cooking spray and greased the short sides of the pan. Melted butter worked better for me (for the batter) and I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder as this was all I had. It takes a little care to spread the bottom layer of batter on the paper in the pan but is doable and I made sure that the patties were positioned 1/2-inch in from all the sides. I placed a sheet pan on the rack below the brownie pan in the oven; this helps with heat distribution and has prevented burning. The brownies took the full 55 minutes in my oven and they were perfect---no burned edges and the middle was cooked but not dry. The Special Dark cocoa makes these extra-rich. Now that I know that with a few extra steps these are a success for me I'll definitely make them more often---especially for gifts or pot lucks.",
