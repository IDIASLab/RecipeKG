Why tell someone to preheat the oven and then go on to direct the cook to use a double boiler for 20 minutes? my oven was on all afternoon. I also could not use the pastry bag or a cookie press. The recipe was runny and only the liquid squeezed out. It never thickened as the recipe stated. This seems like a very laborious way to make macaroons compared to all the other recipes out there.",
