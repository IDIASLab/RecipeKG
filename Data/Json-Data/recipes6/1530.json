                "reviewBody": "I sauteed my onions and mushrooms before adding it to the mix since I don't like raw onions steaming in a meatloaf. I also added 2 small cloves of minced garlic & some black pepper to the mix - this is just my personal taste. After adding all of the ingredients-the mix was so wet it wouldn't even form into a loaf. I gradually added additional bread crumbs until it was just able to form into a loaf. I needed to add over 1/2 cup of extra bread crumbs. Since the recipe stated it should take about 5-6 hours I didn't check it until about 4 hrs and 20 minutes at which point I figured I would add the glaze. The meatloaf already registered 200 degrees! My fault that I didn't check it sooner I suppose so I strongly recommend you check well before the 5 hr. mark. I decided not to leave it in any additional time for fear that it was already a hockey puck so I put the loaf on a cookie sheet topped with glaze and broiled about 5 minutes just to heat and get lightly sticky. I was surprised that even after cooking to such a high temperature the meatloaf was moist and had a perfect texture (thanks to the addition of more bread crumbs). I do think it could use some additional seasoning-maybe a little ketchup or steak sauce. Due to the changes in cooking time & the need for additional bread crumbs I would rate as a 3 but a few changes would make it 5. Excited to learn though that I can make this successfully in a slow cooker!",
