First there is too much milk in this recipe causing the fudge to not set up properly. Another recipe I have that makes a 9 x 13 pan also uses 2/3 cup milk. This recipe only makes an 8 inch square pan. Secondly there is not enough chocolate and or butterscotch chips to give the fudge flavor. The marshmallow creme dominates and while it is fluffy the result is fudge that is too creamy almost to the point of being sticky. The fudge is a very whitish brown and has little chocolate flavor. I will not make this fudge again.",

Taste was a little too butterscotch for me so next time I would use more chocolate and less butterscotch. This fudge was very very soft and creamy and if you like your fudge that way then you'll love this recipe. I like my fudge creamy but a little firmer so I would suggest increasing the amount of chips you use to 2 cups. Will make this again but next time will try using Nestle milk chocolate/caramel chip swirls and semi-sweet chips to make a \"turtle\" fudge.",
