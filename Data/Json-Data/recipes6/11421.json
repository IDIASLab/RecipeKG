I'm not sure why others are having 'texture' issues as I found this to have the perfect texture! It has a great homemade taste and it's so moist. The champagne gives it such a great flavor. I made two 9\" round cakes (with a little bit of batter left over) which made a double-layer round cake. Make sure to drizzle champagne on them - I poked holes in the cakes and drizzled a bit more than the recipe asked for. This really added flavor and moistness. I can't wait to make this again!",
