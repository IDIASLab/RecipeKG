                "reviewBody": "Quite good! I used about 1/2 tsp of salt. \n\nA common problem I find in recipes is the promise that onions will 'brown' in a few minutes. So it is easy to undercook the onions and get a sharp taste. \n\nHere, once the cumin seeds and garlic are in, cooking the onions further will often get you bitter garlic and burnt cumin. So it is a balancing act. \n\nI toast my cumin seeds separately, cook up the onions properly by themselves (a pinch of salt cuts the time considerably), and then add in the toasted cumin, garlic and ginger at the end. Garlic has a lovely perfumed note that appears at about 30 seconds and is gone after  minute, so I like to 'quench' the heat in the pan with pulverized tomato/water to lock in optimal flavour.",
