I found that if using unsalted butter, a bit of salt makes them not taste so bland.  I used unsalted and added about 1/4 tsp but could have used more.  Upped the vanilla a bit.  all in all a good basic sugar cookie recipe.  I liked the ones better that were thinner and crispier...those seemed to have a better buttery flavor.  thanks for the recipe.",

Tasted just like the cookies from The Depression and WWII eras when sugar was a luxury item! JUST enough sweet to be a nice treat! Great for dipping into milk or coffee. It was very sticky no matter what I did. Least sticky just out of the fridge and a very light dusting of flour on both dough and rolling pin. So recommend breaking it up into fourths when chilling. Take out of fridge one quarter of dough at a time when ready to roll out and cut OR breaking off rolling into ball then flatten out a little for baking.",
