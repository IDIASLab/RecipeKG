I used 3 cups skim milk and 2 cups of chicken broth, then added my potatoes, corn (a mixture of sweet corn and regular corn), and spices. I sauteed the onion with cut up chicken breasts, then added that to the soup. I also added several dashes of thyme, oregano, and onion powder. If you let this soup simmer for about an hour, the potatoes become mealy and thicken the soup tremendously without having to use heavy cream as the thickener. I felt that it needed quite a bit of pepper, which was nicely offset by the sweet corn. My whole family enjoyed this chowder and I'll gladly make it again. ",

I sauteed the onion and shallots in butter in a soup pot, then added four chicken breasts with all fat removed, a 32 oz box of chicken broth, additional water to cover chicken (about 2 cups), and boiled until the chicken was cooked and tender. Then I shredded the chicken with two forks right in the pot. I added 2% milk to reach the desired consistency, and also added thyme, onion powder, scant cayenne pepper, and a dash or oregano; I upped the potatoes to 4, and simmered for 45 mins. to let soup thicken and flavors meld. We served the soup with finely shredded 2% milk cheddar on top. Not a true chowder but quite delicious, and definitely not a bad bet calorie-wise!",
