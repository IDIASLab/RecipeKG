                "reviewBody": "I like Morocca food but this recipe is a little disappointing. The concept behind this recipe is great; the excecution is not. First it takes a lot longer than about 45 min-1hr to peel and dice so many tubers not 1/2 an hour. Second 9 hours is so long that the vegetables get overcooked. Third there's so little broth that you run the risk of eating steamed vegetables rather than stewed ones. For the amount of vegetables there's not enough spice so it comes out rather bland. My suggestions: less cooking time by an hour or two double the spice and the broth (or mix in a second set of spices after you finish cooking) use only 3/4 lbs of each tuber and increase the amount of dried fruit. I suppose suggesting using chicken broth or adding meat would be a travesty but it would help make it more flavorful.",

In addition to doubling the spices the dried fruits and the liquid I used white yams instead of using turnips which added another sweet vegetable. I also reduced cooking time ti 6.5 hours on low and toasted a mix of regular and buckwheat couscous to go with it. The other addition that I recommend (suggested by a friend who ate this dish and also spent time in Morocco) is hot sauce to taste which can be added once the dish is served. A day later the leftovers tasted even better!",

Also the spices need adjusting and more salt is needed. Try using as many fresh spices as you can find (instead of powdered) and make sure the liquid covers the vegetables plus an inch or so. Using whole wheat couscous adds a nice taste also. This has become a \"regular\" dish at my house as it can be adjusted for spice levels and whatever root vegetables you can find at the greengrocer's. Nice introduction to North African flavours.",

I made the broth in 3:1 proportion but 2.5 or 2:1 would probably work better next time. I didn't have turnips but did have sweet potatoes so I used one large sweet potato and about 1/2 to 3/4 lb carrots and parsnips. I didn't have dried apricots but had raisins instead so I did that with the prunes. For time constraints I cooked it on high for 3 and a half hours. Turned out great and I'd definitely make this again!!!",
