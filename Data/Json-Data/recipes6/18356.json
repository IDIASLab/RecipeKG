                "reviewBody": "Great recipe! Used it to make a candy bowl!Tips on improving your luck with candy making.\n1. If it's still a liquid, you either added too much water or you didn't reach the needed 300\u00b0F to reach a hard crack candy.\n\n2. If your candy holds up but is kind of sticky when you eat it, you've made a soft-crack candy which forms at 275\u00b0F. Keep it on the heat longer.\n\n3. Temperature is EVERYTHING in candy making, be patient and let it get as hot as it needs to be. Investing in a candy thermometer is useful but not entirely needed. If you don't have one handy, try out the drop-technique. Dip a spatula or spoon into your boiling sugar and drizzle it into ice cold water. When the strands come out brittle and glass-like, you've reached a hard-crack\n\n4. Use a flavoring that's made for candy making! Not all flavorings are made to hold up at 300\u00b0 in fact, most burn off completely before that leaving your candy flavorless. Lorann Oils is a great brand for hard candy.\n\n5. DO NOT let uncooked sugar granules touch your candy before it hardens; it will cause the entire batch to quickly crystallize and become grainy. This includes the granules that splash up on the sides of the pot in the beginning! Keep those scraped down!\n\n6. For a quick and easy cleanup, fill your pot with water and put it on the stovetop to boil. You can also throw in any candy coated utensils you used along the way!",

I put in even a little more than the recipe called for and it smelled great and everything. But come time to break the candy and try it it tasted like nothing just sweet. Not even a hint of flavor no smell nothing!!! Bleh! Now another time I took another reviewer's suggestion and used one and a half packets of Kool-Aid dissolved in just a bit of water and this was much better... unfortunately I ruined the batch by putting it in a glass pan thinking I could cut it into squares before it cooled... dumb idea. Anyhow I will try this again using another flavor of some sort I'm not sure if it was the recipe or just that banana is a bad flavor to make candy with!",

While it was still hot but touchable I cut it into strips and twisted it around chopsticks to make ribbon twists and they looked great. If it is sticking in your teeth you didn't let it heat up quite enough try going all the way to 310 degrees using the (lowish)medium heat. This will normally take 20-30 minutes to heat after the boil is reached. If your burning it turn your heat down to the low side of medium heat and take your time it'll come out fine. Good luck!",
