I halved the recipe and to make it taste richer I used 1 can evaporated milk and then added enough 1% milk to make 4 cups and doubled the amount of vanilla. (for the full recipe of 8 cups milk it would be 2 tbsp instead of 1) I also added a handful strawberries that I crushed a little to the mixture just before freezing. The next time I make this I think I will decrease the amount of sugar just a little bit because I don't like super-sweet ice cream. But otherwise it's really really nice and guilt-free.:o)",

I like the light sweet taste. I did cut the sugar in half, but when I make this again I will use 1 and 1/2 cups sugar because I think I cut a little TOO much out. I also used 2% milk which worked great. It is after midnight and I am making myself go to sleep because I cannot stop eating the ice milk!!!",
