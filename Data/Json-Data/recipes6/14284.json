I'm a good cook who truly enjoys spending time in the kitchen...but there wasn't one person in my household of 5 who liked this dish. In fact it sat around uneaten for quite awhile and I ultimately threw away the last half. Considering how much we all like chocolate and desserts in general I was really disheartened. I can't help but wonder if I did something wrong. Or perhaps that's the way it's supposed to turn out...but it's just not to our taste. And considering the numerous trips I made to various grocery stores in order to get all the ingredients it was quite a letdown...for whatever reason.",
