On the bacon drippings I used maple bacon drippings and omg it was a nice twist.  For the brown sugar I did use light brown sugar just like one of the other reviews but I uped it even more and went with 1 & 1/2 tablespoons. And finally on the salt I went 1 tablespoon sea salt and 1 tablespoon garlic salt and bing bang boom there it is MMMMMMMM GOOD!",

The ingredients sounded intriguing so I tried them and was truly amazed how delicious they are. I didn't have dark brown sugar and didn't want to try to adlib since the recipe only called for 1 Tablespoon so I just added maybe 2 teaspoons more light brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe. I think using dark brown sugar would make them taste better/different but overall I am very pleased with them especially since I can't really taste the whiskey.",

I can't stop eating them and they aren't even done in the oven yet. I may have simmered mine too hard because I had nothing to drain... the whiskey had already reduced to a glaze when they were ready to go in the oven but I would do it the same way again. This glaze is AMAZING. I did also use cayenne as other reviewers have noted. I am so glad we bought HUGE pumpkins and I have tupperwares full of fresh seeds because I will be making many batches of these in the coming weeks.",
