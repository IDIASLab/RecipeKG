I remembered reading somewhere that you can cut almost half of the sugar out of any recipe without affecting the end product.  So I cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I also used fat-free plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I don't have a 10x15 pan so I used a 9x13 and cooked it for 30 min.  I got a nice, moist cake-like bar.  I also frosted it with a Chocolate Peanut Butter frosting made of 2C powdered sugar, 2T cocoa, 4T milk, 2T peanut butter, and 1/2t vanilla.  I really enjoyed these for a way to use up ripe bananas besides the standard banana bread.",

It's so great making a 'bar' recipe the comes out of the pan perfectly and makes a great presentation. I served them chilled because my sister has a similar recipe and for some reason it really brings out the banana flavor. I only used two really dark bananas but you could really taste the flavor; I added some cinnamon, too. For such a simple recipe it really does make a ton - an entire jelly roll pan... WOW! I made a softer frosting of one block cream cheese, 2 cups of powdered sugar, tsp vanilla and some milk to thin it out ever so slightly. Stop searching for recipes... turn off your computer & go make these. They are really delicious.",

Not too sweet either. For the record, a cup of bananas is equal to about 2 good sized bananas mashed up. And if they seem not ripe enough, break them up and nuke it for about 12 seconds on high until you can easily mash them up with a fork.",

I used 3 large bananas (probably was more then the 1 cup called for in the recipe), substituted 1 cup of cake flour for part of the all-purpose, and cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup. If you refrigerate the bars after you frost them until the icing is firm, you can then cut them into individual servings and store in the freezer between wax paper sheets. They freeze beautifully and are great to have on hand for a quick dessert.",

If you are bringing this dish to a fancy party or for some big event like a birthday jazz it up like I did. I dyed the frosting a very pale yellow and I put dark chocolate shavings ontop in fact it even looked like a BANANA!! Thanx again! YUM!",
