I guess I'll try it and see. Will post an update soon. FOR MY UPDATE: I'm sticking with the 4 stars. I had to use square wonton wrappers as none of my local stores carried round ones. Used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 ricotta as I was not able to find farmer's cheese. I was able to fit a hefty 1 tsp of filling into the wrapper and the square worked just fine. They came out great. I've never made a pierogi before but using the wonton wrappers was a breeze. Like others I had WAY more filling than I was able to use with my package of wrappers. I think the package had 50 wrappers and I had enough filling for at least another 25. No biggie I'll just get two packages of wrappers next time. I froze the ones that I didn't cook right away and am going to try them from frozen tonight. Can't wait to try a batch with some spinach worked into the filling.",
