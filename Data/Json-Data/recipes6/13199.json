Changes I made to the dish (taken from the other reviewers) use only 1/2 of the noodles called for (6 oz), slightly undercook them since they will be cooking longer in the oven, half the broccoli, mushrooms and onions, roast the chicken rather than boil the flavor out of it, add about 1 cup of chicken broth to keep it creamy, double the cheese and mix it within the dish,add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, sautee all of the veggies (onion, garlic, celery, mushrooms, and broccoli) in a tablespoon of olive oil until just starting to soften, top with something crunchy (I used potato chips). I also covered the casserole for 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15. It is a great recipe as doctored-probably just okay as written.",

I used frozen chopped broccoli (no mincing for me) and substituted a can of cream of chicken and broccoli soup for one of the chicken ones. I would recommend adding water like other reviews said and sauteeing the onion first (unless you like it crunchy). Before baking I added seasoned bread crumbs for a bit of crunch.

I used chicken quarters (it was on sale) but I forgot to use the broth as some other reviews had mentioned but I will next time as I agree the original recipe doesn't make as much as a sauce as I'd like. I added green peppers more cheese (my husband loves anything with cheese) and added milk twice through baking. I also didn't boil my noodles that long because I knew I wanted to cook it a little bit longer. I can't say enough this recipe is wonderful!",

I had made a couple of roasted chickens with gravy the other night so the gravy ended up taking the place of at least one can of soup. I agree that the recipe needed more liquid so I added a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and some fat free half and half. Again leftover broccoli mushrooms and egg noodles filled the bill. Only had horseradish cheddar on hand which worked surprisingly well. I also topped the casserole with a bit of parm and some panko along with a bit of seasonings. This was so good Joanne and I thank you for not only a delicious recipe but an easy one to boot that helps so much with my busy Monday and Tuesday nights!",
