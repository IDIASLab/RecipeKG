After about 24 hours, thinly sliced zuccini and radishes turned out wonderful in this marinade. However, shredded carrots were REALLY vinegary, and 1/4\" carrot slices were kind of bland. So monitor you pickles closely for flavor.\n\nAlso, I did not think the recipe made enough marinade for the number of carrots, so I would suggest doubling the recipe to be on the safe side.",
