If you're in search of that old fashioned deep, dense, dark chocolate flavor, this is not the recipe for you.I gave it a five because it is very delicious and easy.

My sister-in-law who is a pastry chef even asked for this recipe. A nice addition to this recipe is 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons cinnamon and Mexican vanilla if you have it on hand. The regular pure vanilla works well too. Also I lightly dust it with icing sugar once cool. I call this version Mexican Chocolate Pound Cake as Mexican chocolate often contains cinnamon. If you are looking for a deliciously rich dense and attractive cake this is the cake!! NB Don't bake this cake on convection setting as it will bubble over--on a regular bake setting this cake bakes beautifully.",
