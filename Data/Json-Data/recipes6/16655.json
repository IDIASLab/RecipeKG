I also made them with and without the walnuts, and they're much better with them. They're a great, unusual addition to my Christmas cookie baking and were a hit with everyone who's tried them.",

I wouldn't call these cookies--much more like little cakes--very moist--they were sticky the next day. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts and they tasted really good. The texture was odd, unlike anything I've ever eaten. When I placed them on the cookie sheet, they were in little mounds and I expected them to melt down and flatten as cookies do but they didn't. Whatever shape you place them in on the rack is the shape they will have when baked. The batter would work well in molds or rings to create an autumn treat. Good flavor but I added more cinnamon and nutmeg because I like these flavors. My husband's golf buddies ate them up!",

One thing I would say is that to me pumpkin cookies never taste as good the first day. The second day the flavors just seem to come together and the taste is much better!",
