I made 2 versions one with celery and one without celery won hands down. I did not add as much celery as I would for a traditional potato salad. I did not add the sugar. I substituted fresh chives for the green onions. The bacon was added at the very end to ensure it wasn't soggy. If you make it the night before be sure to leave it out for a little while before serving the sour cream makes the dish set up kind of hard. This will be made many times over. Thank you!!!",
