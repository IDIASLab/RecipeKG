We couldn't find white chocolate pudding so we used regular chocolate pudding mix. We also used a cinnamon sugar mix we already had made instead of just cinnamon. We ended up using 2 tins of biscuit dough and it filled up our bunt pan when it was cooked. This was a very sweet dessert but it was great. We ended up pouring the left over pudding sugar mixture over the top before we baked it and it made a gooey delicious mess. I think a scoop of good vanilla icecream would help cut the sweetness. We will definitely make this again but next time we will use just cinnamon and not pour the left over pudding sugar mix over the bread.",
