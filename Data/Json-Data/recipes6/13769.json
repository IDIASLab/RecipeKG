I did have to make a few changes though since partly into mixing I realized I didn't have everything! I mixed all my \"wet\" ingredients first along with oil (no shortening...) and then dumped the dry ingredients on top. (I do this with every single muffin recipe and it works perfectly every time no need for 2 bowls ever). When I then noticed I was out of nutmeg to:( I found some all spice and threw that in. No orange zest to be had so just skipped that. I also added 4 tbsp sour cream just to be sure they would be super moist and then FOLDED THE BATTER WITH A FORK GENTLY TURNING THE BOWL AS I CONTINUED TO BRING THE BATTER INTO THE CENTRE until it was just mixed. After spooning into the muffin pan I sprinkled with a crumble topping of brown sugar oats flour and butter. PERFECT MUFFINS EVERY TIME... BE GENTLE. (also no need to cut the cranberries up. They are wonderful whole as well. This is where people mess up their muffins. By beating the batter too hard with a fork (or worse a mixer) you are removing the air from your muffin which is what makes them so moist and rise perfectly when cooking. Keep it simple. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Then I grind the cranberries add the orange juice and orange zest. I freeze that on Thanksgiving day I then assemble these so they are fresh out of the oven. We love these muffins. I always do a double batch and bake them in jumbo muffin tins. We really like them for breakfast with a simple omelet too. THanks for sharing!!!!",
