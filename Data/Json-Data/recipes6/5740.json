I cooked according to the recipe but maybe I just need to cook long enough to heat the corn and take off. I have made a similar recipe on AR using fresh corn and it is wonderful but it is not easy to find fresh corn in the winter. I will try this again but just experiment on cooking times and maybe even try a different brand of frozen corn.",
