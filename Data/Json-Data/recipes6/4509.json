My husband had been complaining about me never serving meat so I skipped the cheese and simply sauteed 8 oz. of sliced knockwurst (my old stand-by) with the onions and garlic at the beginning of the recipe. Oh and I used olive oil instead of butter - keeping it kosher.:) My husband and daughter loved it. It's very hearty - a great recipe for those crisp autumn days.",
