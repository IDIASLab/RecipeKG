After the thighs were cooked, I took them out of the slow cooker and stirred in a little cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce, which worked out great. Served over Jasmine rice and with a side of 'garlic broccoli' also from this site. The family cleaned their plates, so that makes this a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

It was super easy, was made with ingredients I always have on hand, and it tasted GREAT with no adjustments necessary to the recipe! I used 8 chicken thighs & also 9 chicken tenders so I could free up space in the freezer and there was still Plenty of sauce! I put the chicken in a dish when it was done, strained the sauce into a saucepan, skimmed off the fat with a ladle & heated the strained  sauce with some cornstarch to thicken, and then poured the sauce over the chicken. I served it with brown rice & asparagus--Yum!!! Thank you for the great recipe! It will definitely be a keeper in our house!",

Serve over rice or noodles with a veg. or salad on the side and it is a flavorful and very easy meal.  If you have a couple more minutes to spare on prep, and a few more ingredients in your pantry - I find this makes it even better- but just as easy:  Prepare as directed (I find you can use up to 6 thighs and still have plenty of sauce, and I use skinless thighs that still have the bone.) Add one - or more - or all- of the following to the sauce before pouring over chicken:  1 small onion chopped, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  When done, if you happen to have any, add some fresh chopped green onion or scallions or parsley on top just before serving.  Some sesame seeds would also be a nice garnish.  But,,,,again, for such a simple recipe it is perfectly acceptable as is.",

I served it with rice pilaf with broccoli bits & slivered carrots & sliced almonds, & green salads as side dishes. Because of Asian type flavor, the only additions I made to this already perfect recipe were I drizzled a scant teaspoon of sesame oil over top and sprinkled about a half tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds over the top too about the last hour in the slow cooker & the seeds made it look really pretty & appealing & added a slight nice crunch.\nThanks for the easy & delicious dinner idea & recipe!",

I put the garlic but used minced bc i didnt have fresh. I also added 1/2 cup sweet baby rays bbq and 1/4 cup brown sugar. And i also added red pepper flakes. (Thanks to suggestions of others)Cooked as recipe states...maybe a lil less time wasnt exactly timing it. Prob 4.5hrs. I then took thighs placed in baking pan. And the remaining liquid in pan i put in saucepan with cornstarch to thicken it up. I poured a lil over each thigh. Baked 15 or 20min on 400 degrees. It looked exactly like the picture. It was not too salty. The meat fell off bone. Served over white rice with seasoned and roasted brussel sprouts which i all cooked same time as the chicken in oven. So everything was done at same time. And it was very good. Its not like an award-winning chicken dish but it was packed with flavor, relatively healthy, super easy to make, other than slow cooker time it was quick to make. I will def make again. My boyfriend rates the chicken an 8 out of 10. So for a quick wed night meal ill take it and def make again!",
