I didn't follow this exactly - I used 7 c. of fruit total - probably 5 c. strawberry/2 c. cranberry, 7 c. of sugar, one packet of pectin, the juice of two tangerines and one lemon and the zest of the tangerines.  The flavor is outstanding.  Mine is just coming to cool now (I did a water bath), so I don't know how set it will be with the extra acidic juice, but we use jam a lot in plain yogurt or on pancakes so we don't mind if it's a bit thin.  Really, really outstanding!!! Added the next day: the jam is cooled and is definitely set like a jam - not thin at all.  And really, really delicious!",
