I made a second batch using other reviewers suggestions; I exchanged a cup of the white sugar with a cup of brown sugar, and added my own spice mixture blend. The second batch was even deeper in color and stronger in spices then the first batch. I will stick to the second method. Also, let this sit and cool overnight. Next moring put the glass pint jars in freezer. Be sure and leave 1/2'' headspace in jar for expansion, Or freeze in plastic containers. Family LOVED this! Thank you for recipe.",

I probably used more pumpkin pie spice using my own blend so I'd guess I used an extra two teaspoonfuls. Came out really nice - maybe a bit looser than I was expecting perhaps due to my reducing the sugar but that's fine. That extra cup of sugar might have made this too sweet for me so I'm thrilled with my results. Thanks Bea!",

Well worth the time it took as well as the pumpkin-covered kitchen! Tastes AMAZING!",
