It was like being on one of those cooking shows where the judge is skeptical about too many strong flavors, then pronounces it perfectly balanced when it all comes together. I found it was helpful to work as a team in the kitchen on this dish, with so many parts and pieces going on. Even though the chives were fiddly they were very pretty for presenting the bundles and nicer than toothpicks to keep it together, but next time I may not bother boiling them. I was out of Dijon mustard, but yellow worked just fine. Leftovers were still good, and we saved some extra cheese mixture to use on bagels the next day.",

This worked really well, ... my husband is not a great fish lover but liked it very much and as well my mom loved it! I had ricotta cheese as a substitute and it worked very well. Fresh dill was great. Best served fresh I feel with the sauce spooned over but reheated pretty well too. Also I did use only one bunch of very large asparagus spears and had about 6 three inch pieces in each roll. I thought about two rolls person with a nice salad would be nice summer meal in the future.",
