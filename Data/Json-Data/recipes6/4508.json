I didn't have zucchini so I subbed some other veggies (like green pepper and mushrooms), and I also ended up cooking it for a little longer.  I also did water and vegan chicken bouillon for the noodles.  I did ginger powder because I had it, but I think fresh ginger would be great...maybe cut the amount of spices (I did 3/4).",

I also cut the curry powder down a little though not by much. The only other change I made was using 6 oz. coconut milk instead of evaporated milk and coconut extract. My family loved this and I'll definitely be making it again. Tastes even better served with a pot of coconut rice!",
