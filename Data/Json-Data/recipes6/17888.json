To cut back on the sweetness and on the juice, I used NO added sugar in the fruit.   I used orange marmalade for the preserves and froz peaches in place of raspberries and there was plenty of juice and it was quite sweet.  (Sugar draws juice out, so it will have more liquid with the added sugar!)\r\nAlso, I used Fuji apples which have less tendency to turn brown, and added the apples last so that they could be stirred into the other fruit to coat the apples.  I had NO browning that way.\r\nTo save time with  the chips, I first sprayed 4 tortillas at a time with butter spray, front and back, and then cut them with the pizza cutter.   Then I put the sugar mix ...1 c sugar to 1 t cinnamon,,,into a bowl and dredged the chips 2 at a time.   One batch of the sugar mix did 2+ batches of the chips.  I simply 'baggied' the remainder and used it another time.  I did NOT spray them after sugaring.  They don't need it if you spray both sides first.\r\nThey did best at about 9-10 minutes baking.   \r\nOverall, everyone loved this and neither the fruit nor chips were to sweet.",

It works great on strawberries!!!\nJust put Them in and slice them and then turn the other way and slice again. It dices them perfectly. I also use it for other soft fruits (kiwi, peaches etc. Just peel & cut into chunks first & use it the same way as with strawberries.",

                "reviewBody": "I have made this recipe numerous times & everyone ALWAYS LOVES IT!  It can take some time to make.  I recommend chopping fruit with a food chopper (pampered chef has an excellent one).  When I am really crammed with time I buy my cinamom sugar chips from Trader Joe's or if I'm lucky I sometimes find them at a grocery store.  When I make the chips myself, after thoroughly cleaning my sink out I put a dinner plate in the sink & stack all the tortillas on it & spray both sides of the tortilla (4 at a time) with I can't believe its not butter or some other butter flavor spray.  I then place the cinamon/sugar mix in the container the cinamon usually comes in (since it has the top with holes to sprinkle with) & sprinkle both sides of the tortilla BEFORE CUTTING it.  This helps tremendously with the mess!  Out of the sink on a seperate plate I cut 4 tortillas at a time with a pizza cutter.  I didn't follow the cooking time the recipe reccomends (my oven is old) I would tap a couple of chips & once they felt a little crispy & were golden brown they are done! (the chips turn crispier as they cool) I usually use apricot preserves, & granny smith apples or fuji apples.  As previous reviewers recomend, I cut the apples last to prevent browning.  I sprinkle cinnamon & sugar to my taste for the salsa mix (I cut out brown sugar...to skip a step) I thought with the chips the recipe just didn't need as much sugar.  This recipe is very versatile so play around with it!  I hope this helps!",

After a few shakes all the chips were coated on both sides and I just layed them on the pans.  Worked a lot easier than doing it one at a time.  Overall, it was a miniature version of a fruit salad.

The fruit salsa was very soggy and the cinnamon tortillas were just so-so. My dad liked it and it's the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. It turned out to be pretty expensive and created a huge mess. I wish I could have liked it as much as everyone else:(",
