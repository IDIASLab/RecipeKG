In the years that I have made it I have learned a few things but I cant figure out how to modify the recipe on here. 1. I always mix the onion broccoli and raisins with the dressing the day before I serve it. This allows the acid in the vinegar to \"cook\" the veggies to reduce the raw flavors and the raisins will soak up a little of the flavor of the dressing. I try to stir the salad a couple times throughout the sitting time to redistribute the dressing and make sure everything is well coated. 2. Right before serving mix in the bacon and cashews and stir well. This will keep the bacon and cashews crunchy and salty. 3. There are may choices out there for salty/crunch instead of cashews you can sub with peanuts sunflower seeds etc. 4. I prefer raisins because they re-hydrate a little while they sit in the dressing but you can choose any other sweet dried bits to add such as cranberries. To me they add a different element because they arent sweet and they dont plump up like the raisins. I recommend trying different combos of add-ins You could even add some diced cheddar cheese or shredded Parmesan. I've added shredded carrots (when my shopper bought a bag of pre-shredded broccoli/carrot mix thinking he was saving me time)",
