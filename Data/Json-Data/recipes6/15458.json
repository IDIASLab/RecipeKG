I used the basic recipe but then tweeked it to suit my tastes.  I used a oreo cookie bottom and then added some homemade rasberry/blackberry sauce. I put the ice cream on top and instead of using whipped cream I crumbled a chocolate cake on top mixed with toasted peacans and some ice cream chocolate sauce.  Then I drizzled the top with butterscotch ice cream topping.  This cake was divine.  I will never need to buy an ice cream cake again.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can keep it simple or make it complicated and it is still incredible.  ",

I made 2- 9\" round chocolate cakes and layered with the chocolate ganache recipe here and crushed oreos. Froze this then topped with this ice cream mixture. Froze again til stiff then frosted with whipped topping ganache and oreos. My husband loved it for a birthday cake and wants more! Very rich can;t eat a huge slice. Way cheaper and better than dairy queen or Brusters.",
