I did make the mistake of serving them alongside some empanadas which were very sweet. The sweetness made these seem bland. Today I tried it again and wow!!! They were wonderful. I also wonder if the flavor blended more the next day? I had a mom in my daughter's class (who is from Mexico) try one and she loved it. She said her mom would also sprinkle powdered sugar on these for looks. I really didn't find them to be any more labor intensive than making sugar cookies. When others find out that you soaked anise seeds in rum they label you as a great cook! I think I'll take that title and run with it! I will def. keep this recipe. Thank you Ruben!",

Followed the recipe except ran out of all purpose flour so had to use 1/4 whole wheat flour to make the 2.5 cups and had to flour my board w/the wheat flour and they still came out beautiful! Didn't have ground clove so had about 1/2 tsp. allspice left in my container so used that. Soaked the seeds last night and by this morning they had absorbed all the rum. The anise is not overpowering but yet it is there. Made these into hearts for Valentine's day and going to ice them \"Sugar Cookie Icing\" (submitted by Janice Brubaker here on Allrecipes) and add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the glaze so as not to 'steal' anything from the taste of this wonderful creation. I am the world's worst cookie 'roller' and these rolled out beautifully and cut well. Very sturdy cookie. These are just the best! Reminds me of a good pizelle. Could leave out the bit of clove and still have the best cookie. This is probably the best cookie recipe I have ever tried on here and I have tried many good ones. thank you so much for a recipe that I shall use for years to come.",

I used real butter so the dough was quite stiff after being in the fridge all night. I bet these would be great rolled into a log and sliced off. They were easy to roll out and baked off beautifully. I sprinkled a little sugar on top for sparkle as another reviewer suggested. I found out that \"Borrachio\" or \"Borracho\" means \"drunk\" or \"drunken\".
