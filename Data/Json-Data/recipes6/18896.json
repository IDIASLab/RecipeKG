Well, it turned out I wasn't settling because it turned out fantastic, and I normally don't care for smoothies much. I used a bunch of different fruit, but kiwi is the main fruit here and the smoothie has a nice slightly tart, tangy, and sweet taste. I use soy milk, but non-fat milk would taste the same. I also used tangelos because that's what I had, but oranges or tangerines would work just as well.",
