This was so easy only three ingredients.  I will never cook another pinic ham any other way....my family agrees :). probably will never cook another spiral precooked ham ever again either. PS: used a slow cooker with a temp probe which worked well, set the cooker for a 10 1/2 lb ham to reach 160 as this recipe stated, the packaged ham said to reach 145 degree, probably should have split that temp degree but still this is a 5 star recipe.",
