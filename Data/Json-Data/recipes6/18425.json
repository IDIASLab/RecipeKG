I was told from a customer at an old job that \"avocado cheesecake is the best kind of cheesecake you'll ever have\". I suppose I should have looked at other recipes before trying this one. It is not a traditional New York-style cheesecake but rather an avocado cheese cornbread. I baked it for a few extra minutes because it did not turn \"golden brown\" and even then it only cooked about a half-inch through while remaining a gritty mush underneath. However I believe I have learned a valuable lesson and am looking forward to making an actual avocado cheesecake.",
