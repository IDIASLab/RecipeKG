My advice is to dab only a small amount of the egg wash on top of the batter, using your fingertips, rather than trying to brush it on. The egg wash was thick enough that blobs of it fell into the muffin tin cups. I removed as much as I could and stored the remaining wash in a closed glass jar in the refrigerator, then used it next time as part of a quiche. I appreciate the contributor posting this for others to share but it was not worth the effort to have only 5 muffins.",
