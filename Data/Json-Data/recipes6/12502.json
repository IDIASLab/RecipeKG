Can't stress that enough. You can sift the dry ingredients to be sure those get mixed well and then USE A HAND MIXER when you add in the wet ingredients prior to adding the chips. Don't use the mixer when you add the chips. The cookies should be puffy when they come out of the oven and then flatten as they cool.",

This cookie is everything you'd want it to be--chewy, gooey, chocolatey, pretty, and sinfully good. I, too, added 1/2 tsp. salt, but not for height, as one reviewer suggested, but because salt makes flavors \"come alive.\" This is one great cookie!",
