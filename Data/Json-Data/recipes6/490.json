It baked up crunchy, chewy, sweet, salty and delicious.  Due to a time crunch, I started the squash in the microwave with the cavities filled and microwaved for about 6 minutes.  This made my small halves almost completely cooked.  I then put them in a toaster oven at 350\u00b0 to finish baking, about 15 minutes.  My son ate the second half for his lunch the next day and I received a text that read \"That squash was awesome!\"  Yep, that pretty much summed up the taste of this squash - awesome!",
