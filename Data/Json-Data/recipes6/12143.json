While it seems like just a basic cookie dough with add-ins on it surface, it is so much better than just that.  Full of flavor, a variety of textures, not too sweet, chewy middle, crispy edges, just wonderful!  I followed the recipe with no changes save for using chocolate chips instead of the raisins - the combination of the semi-sweet chocolate and the coconut was a perfect match.  I couldn't decide between the Rice Krispies or the Special K Protein Plus ( a flake type cereal) I had on hand and in the end the Special K won out.  This is simply a good, old-fashioned, cookie jar type cookie, a make-again for sure.",

They are a hearty not too sweet cookie. They didn't spread much; I was a bit surprised. I don't know what the bf did with my raisins so I used currants instead and I don't have coconut so I added in craisins. I'll try them again with coconut and I'm sure they'll be good with coconut as well. Thanks for the recipe!",

I only used 1/4 cup of margerine (didn't have butter) and 1/2 cup apple sauce. I didn't have raisons so replaced with slivered almonds and as suggested used corn flakes. 4/5 cause of the changes.

Other then that I followed the recipe exactly but was afraid that it was getting \u201cover beaten\u201d especially because I wanted to make sure the salt and baking powder were mixed in. The batter was loose and did spread but the texture and taste was delicious. I only wished I had increased the amounts of \u201cadd ins\u201d, especially the coconut, by at least a quarter cup and maybe add some nuts.  Will definitely make again.
