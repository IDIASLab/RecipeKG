I did think some of the ingredient amount seemed a bit off. I halved both the seasonings and used 1 cup of chopped spinach. I added 2 pinches of salt and 1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese. I realized it called for Italian seasoning after making them and so I rolled them in 3~4 pinches of Italian seasoning. I used 1/4 cup measuring cup to divide the mixture. It made 10 meatballs. I baked them on a foil lined sheet sprayed with cooking spray. I also sprayed the meatballs with olive oil. They took 30 minutes, to bake, turning about every 10 minutes. The meatballs came to 99 cal each as made.",

I used 1/2 c. though 1/4 would be great if you have to hide it from the kids, but 1/2 c. was not overkill. One review mentioned dryness so I cooked half the time covered with foil, then removed it second half to brown. I used an 8x8 baking dish and the result was 16 meatballs. They were juicy and tasty. These were even better for lunch the next day. Will be a regular at our house!",

I added a little Worcestire sauce, salt, pepper, dried parsley, dried oregano and Badhia all purpose seasoning. Kept the egg and fresh spinach as they were, and replaced the Italian Style breadcrumbs for Garlic and Herb breadcrumbs. Added half a pack of cream cheese, and about a 1/4 of a cup of three cheese italian shredded cheese. Baked it as it was suggested, covered half the time and uncovered for the remaining time. I finished them by cooking  for 15 min. in low temperature on a pool of  spaghetti sauce. They turned out AMAZING!!!!!!",

Additionally, I am not a fan of Italian seasoning, so I added a tspn of smoked paprika. The temperature I baked at was 400 and I followed a suggestion of another reviewer (to prevent dry meatballs, & they came out nicely moist): I placed the balls onto a piece of foil and covered with foil for the first half 12 minutes and then uncovered for another 15. The total cooking time was almost 30 min for me. I put in for longer bc I'm in the mountains (Denver) & also bc I made them large. As big as my palm. They do taste great and thanks for the great base recipe!",
