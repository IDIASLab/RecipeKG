The second time I made it I used a 9 inch cake pan. I lined the inside of the pan with nonstick aluminum foil and trimmed the excess to 3 inches above the height of the pan. There was no seepage and the tart removed easily from the pan. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg for extra flavor. All in all an easy recipe to prepare and quite delicious. Thanks for sharing.",

My friend made this for my birthday and then showed me how to do it but I did not have a recipe for the pastry part and could not replicate what she showed me. I also needed the reminder for slicing the apples thinly...it makes a difference. So let me share a tip about using an ovenproof saucepan. She melted the sugar on the stovetop in the same pan until amber color and turned off the heat and turned the pan to coat the sides and then layered the sliced and peeled apples and topped with the pastry. No mess no added butter and when you fill the pan to the top with apples (took 5-6 apples) it's easy to flip over and comes out great! Fresh whipped cream is a great final touch!",

Also DO NOT put this in a springform pan because it does not create \"drips\" in your oven. It creates an entire pool of melted butter and sugar that will stink up your entire house as it burns on the bottom of your oven! And I followed the directions (and then some) and put numerous sheets of foil under the pan in all directions and it still leaked everywhere!!!!! Beware and use a tart pan or pie plate for this but nothing with a removable bottom!!",
