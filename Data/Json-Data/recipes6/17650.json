There were two major recipe problems - one is that the ingredient list calls for chopped chocoloate, then the recipe calls for melted chocolate with no step for melting. The second problem was with the sifting instructions. It calls for 2.5 C of sifted cake flour, but then the directions tell you to sift the flour with the baking soda and salt. For recipe semantics this was hard - do I sift once, measure and then sift again with other ingredients or did it really intend for 2.5 C flour, sifted. For the wet ingredients I decided that 2.5 C flour was appropropriate, so I sifted after measuring, but after eating I decided that I should have done a double sift, which would have resulted in a lighter cake with more rise to it. The comma was truly important here and I wonder if many of the complaints about the denseness could have alleviated with some clearer sifting direction. Anyway - the tast was wonderful - I ended up with little slivers of the white chocolate (since I didn't pre-melt). I will make again.",
