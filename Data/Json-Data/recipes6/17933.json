It makes an excellent summer desert (well it's summer now in Australia anyway). When I made it I made a few alterations to the recipe. I used a can of coconut cream instead of the evaporated milk and essence (as my father had just gone and bought a large quantity of the stuff as it was greatly reduced -- so I had to figure out a way to use it!) I also used a little less sugar (just to suit my parents' tastes but others might prefer it to be sweeter). But all in all it is a great beautifully tasting recipe.",

Thsi held it's shape very well after unmolding w/out having too gelatinous a texture. It's texture was very similiar to an airy meringue....very enjoyable.
