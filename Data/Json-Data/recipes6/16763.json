I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and increase the butter to 5 tablespoons.  I also combine the flour and cocoa and whisk it before I add it to the butter.  Also, if you let the butter cool for a bit after melting it will decrease the chance for lumps.  Also, I add the sugar to the milk with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and stir to disolve before adding it to the butter/cocoa/flour mixture.  The original recipe makes a great cold chocolate pudding.",

I added an extra 1/2 T cocoa, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp salt.  It wasn't my cup of tea, but that's not to say that this recipe isn't good.
