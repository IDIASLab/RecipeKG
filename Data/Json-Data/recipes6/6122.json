Anyways she's a self-described \"marzipan snob\" and usually refuses to eat it. After some basic coercion and much begging on my part she agreed to try it...and said it was the best marzipan she's ever had. I made this in order to sculpt little bananas to top some banana-filled chocolate cupcakes I made. I brought the leftovers to my boyfriends house and his 10 year-old brother greatly enjoyed making figures out of it. It's a great activity for kids if your kids like playdough and you're okay with cleaning up the inevitable mess. As one might expect it's sort of a pain to work with (mine was really sticky and I didn't want to add too much sugar for fear of grainy candy) but the texture is perfect; not to dry as lots of marzipan usually is. The corn syrup really adds a lot. Overall there's nothing I would change and I'll definitely be making it again.",
