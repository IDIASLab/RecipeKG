The green onions didn't really mesh well with the rest of the salad (and two cups was WAY too much) and the anchovy flavor was just too much. It was also strange that the potatoes were cold and the sausage was hot. We basically just picked out the olives.",

                "reviewBody": "This is by far one of the better potato salads I have tried. The one negative is that there is way too much oil. I did change up one of the steps. I do not see the purpose of letting the potatoes sit in the dressing overnight. I mean I get it. You want the potatoes to absorb the flavor but this isn't the way to do that. The oil would solidify and you'd have to pull it out an hour or so before it was time to eat. As another reviewer mentioned too, cold potatoes and warm sausage don't go together. Here was my solution and it worked like a champ. When the potatoes were cool enough to handle yet still warm on the inside, I chopped them up and put them in a large bowl, poured the dressing over them, put the lid on, gave them a good shake, and let them come to room temperature for an hour. I then added the cooked sausage and the rest of the ingredients and gave it another shake. With the exception of too much oil, this turned out perfectly. You could always use the full amount of oil and drain it off but why waste oil? I will start with 1/2 cup next time and go from there. Oh and the two cups of green onions must be a typo. That would be overkill. I'm assuming it is supposed to be just two green onions.",
