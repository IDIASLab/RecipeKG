I added some rum-soaked raisins and used diced candied cherries as I couldn't get maraschino cherries when I needed them. I also couldn't find the flavoring so I used a mix of vanilla almond and a bit of maple flavoring. Wonderful blend if you have the same problem. My family is Polish and we will definitely be adding this to the dessert list...awsome!",
