Other than that, we really like this recipe.  My changes:  cut down on cumin (to 2 tsps.), added the can of black beans for protein, drained the corn, used 3 8oz. boxes of veggie broth  and 2 cups of water (makes it cheaper to make and you don't notice the difference!).  We also added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end (didn't have any lime), but I will definitely add more lime juice (1/3 cup of fresh squeezed) next time along with less chile peppers!  This has the potential to be a great recipe, though, so I gave it 4 stars.  Loved using the frozen peppers/onions...didn't know that product existed until this recipe!  PS--I made it again using the lime juice and it was great!  Also, substituted 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes for the crushed ones and we liked that better, too.  I think we have finally found our veggie tortilla soup recipe!",

I used 2 T. of cumin, 2 cans of chopped green chiles, 2 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes (one plain, one with sweet onion), a 32 oz. container of organic vegetable broth and 14 oz. of water with 2 vegetable bouillon cubes, one can of black beans, and about 1/4 of a bag of frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn.  Everyone loved it and my husband had some at 10 pm because he couldn't get the taste out of his head.  Great as is, but when you serve it with Chile Lime Tortilla Chips and the avocado and cheese, it takes it to a whole new level.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I've been craving vegetarian tortilla soup for almost a year now....and I found it! The soup really is so simple and DELICIOUS! The cumin is key to the authentic tortilla soup flavor. I added some chopped fresh mushrooms (just because) at the last five minutes with the corn, and I added a rinsed & drained can of black beans as well. I also topped it with a healthy squeeze of lime and some chopped fresh cilantro before serving. Thanks for the recipe!",

I do reccomend using less cumin though - we used half as much and it was plenty I think more might have blotted out the flavors of everything else. We also used only 1 can of peppers - 2 might have been ok but again I think three would have been too much. I like that this is a very quick meal and it tastes wonderful. Next time I'm going to try using pan toasted tortillas  - instead of chips - to cut down on the salt and fat. Will also add black beans next time and maybe some chicken for the non-vegetarian in the household.",

I think I may try roasting the peppers and maybe adding a little chili powder. I'm thinking stewed Mexican tomatoes blended up would be better than crushed tomatoes. I also put in one can of black beans it would even be good with two. So its definitely worth your time to make (its very simple) and then you can modify to your tastes. I've come back two days later to add to my review. This soup definitely tasted better the next day and I also pureed the rest in the blender and liked it even better!
