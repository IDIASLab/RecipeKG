So when I made it I substituted the cake mix for a box of brownie mix and prepared the brownies according to the package directions for \"cake-like\" brownies. I also didn't have espresso so I just put already ground coffee into a grinder and processed it on the fine setting. It worked very well. I followed the rest of the recipe and dipped them in dark chocolate. Very yummy!! It yielded 24 servings.",
