Then microwaved and strained the peas. I sauteed onion jalapeno and spices in skillet for 3 minutes then added sliced asparagus. Cooked until asparagus was done to our taste at which I tossed in peas and couscous couscous. Mixed it all up in the skillet for a moment and then served. We tried the mint but picked it off and added parmesan cheese. I think the flavor would be pretty much the same since I used all the ingredients except the mint. Mint was just weird for us. Will make this again just the way I did. We really liked the flavor.",

I usually use whatever herbs or veggies I have around at the time. I will often trade the mint for basil cilantro or parsley depending on what is fresh in my garden. I will also use any vegis in my refrigerator that are leftover from previous meals..Carrots zucchini green beans etc. You can't add to many vegetables if they are diced small. I almost prefer to have a half vegis to half pearl couscous in the end. Is a wonderful accompaniment to shrimp fish chicken or vegetarian alternative meats.",
