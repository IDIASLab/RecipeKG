Also, by using the pumpkin puree you are really getting quite a bit of fiber in your dessert. Great tasting AND somewhat good for you too. This is my new favorite cake.

                "reviewBody": "Given that many GREAT pumpkin bread recipes call for a can of pumpkin, 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil, unlike most other reviewers of this recipe I did not reduce the amount of oil.  I prepared it as written, with one cup oil and was quite pleased with the delicious result.  I did, however, make a few other minor modifications.  First, I used a French Vanilla cake mix which I always prefer over yellow any day of the week - it has less of that artificial cake mix taste yellow cake mixes are so notorious for.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, again to camouflage that tell-tale cake mix taste and, rather than the spices called for,  I used a \"one serving\" recipe of \"Pumpkin Pie Spice I,\" recipe also from this site.  I confess I don't know what the baking soda was for - I did add it, but I'm sure the cake would not have been compromised without it.  I added 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter, but not the pecans.  I baked it in a Bundt pan at 350 degrees, about 55 minutes.  When cool, I glazed it with a cream cheese glaze: 4 ozs. cream cheese, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3 T. half-and-half.  Finally, to pretty it up a bit, I sprinkled it with chopped pecans. This is a beautiful and nicely spiced pumpkin cake, made easy and quite satisfactorily with a humble cake mix.",

It could be a little spicier but I made for guests so I think it's perfect for the occasion. Made in a bundt pan baked for about 45 minutes. Frosted with homemade cream cheese icing...pulled out a little frosting and put green food coloring in it. Put orange food coloring in the rest of the icing then spread the orange icing all over the cake. Put an edible ice-cream cup (that kids eat ice-cream out of) in the hole of the bundt cake and frosted that green. Piped some green stripes down the side and 'voila!!!! Made a literal pumpkin cake that looks like one too!!! Had just enough batter left over to make a couple of mini-loaves and that's what I just ate...it is awesome. I saw where some reviewers messed with the amount of oil but I think it's perfect!!!",
