Instead of preparing as suggested I swirled together the peanut butter and chocolate dough to create a marbled effect. These cookies are much better the second day. Make them at least a day ahead of serving. Over time the chocolate part seems to absorb some moisture from the peanut butter part and the flavors meld together.",

I made a number of alterations after reading the reviews. 1 - Used butter instead of shortening (thought we were out). 2 - Used 2 eggs. 3 - Used 1/4 teaspoon salt. (I would have used 1/2 but wanted to be careful as I was using salted butter. They didn't seem too salty.) 4 - Used 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder- they were still a little flat but not horrid. I will try full TBS next time. 5 - Used 1/2 cup peanut butter. I would have used chocolate chips if I'd had them... rather if I'd known we had them. They were still tasty with out I just happen to be very partial to chocolate. Also I made them small- as directed and it made the full 4 dozen. Thanks for the recipe!",
