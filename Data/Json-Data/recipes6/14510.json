                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe, I used vidalia onions which made it pretty sweet--that is even after leaving out the sugar. I did CARMELIZE my onions, though, as I feel this is what a true FRENCH onion soup should be.  Carmelizing actually causes a chemical change to many vegetables in that it changes a complex carbohydrate to a simple carbohydrat--therefore, sweetness!  Carmelizing also makes things taste richer.  Therefore I spent over 30 minutes frying my onions instead of the recipe's 10 minutes.  There is no hard definite time in carmelizing as it depends on your cookware--I use a 9\" cast-iron dutch oven because again the cast-iron provides depth to your food.  I would also recommend using butter if you possibly can because margarine and oleo are oil whipped with water, so it will change your outcome and your amounts should probably be adjusted if using those.  Butter has a personality of its own and when it is cooked and part of the carmelizing process it adds a whole different dimension of flavor and richness that provides a heady sumptuousness about it that oil just can't match. If using very sweet onions like I did, I would suggest not adding the sugar and using a wine that was dry and not sweet also a more bland or aged cheese or a cheese like swiss to counter the sweetness of the onions.  Enjoy it like I did and Happy eating!!",

I substituted one red onion for a yellow, because reds give this soup an excellent complex flavor.  Slipped a few tablespoons of sherry in when adding the beef broth and didn't dilute the broth with water.  This has to be the best onion soup I have tried, and I have had many over the years.",
