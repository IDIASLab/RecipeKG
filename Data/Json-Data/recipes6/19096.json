This reminded me of the 1950's in Florida when a pop-up frozen desert - Lily Dily- was sold at grade school for a nickel. From a timing perspective a little tricky getting the frozen consistency just right 2 hrs. in freezer a liquid mush; 3-1/4 hrs. about right around the edges; next morning rock hard. Next time I might add 2-3 tablespoons of alcohol like vodka (neutral w/o modifying flavor) or cointreau (orange liqueur flavored with the peel of sour and sweet oranges from Curacao and Spain) since alcohol doesn't freeze.
