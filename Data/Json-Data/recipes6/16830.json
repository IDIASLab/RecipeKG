The second time I didn't let it get to this point but the resulting glaze was too watery. This stuff is my fault. I'm sure that making a caramelized-glaze is one of those things that I should have learned in home ec. But there are major problems with the ratios of ingredients. The orange actually overpowers the wasabi! I increased the wasabi by 5 times and the orange was still overpowering. I would probably only use 2T to 1/4 c of orange juice. Also the sauce is much too sweet. At least in these proportions the sugary-orange wine glaze does not compliment the wasabi taste. The orange/wine glaze is really delicious though. I gave the recipe two stars because this combination is so unique that I'm sure that just a few changes could make this a really wonderful dish -- just not in its current form.",
