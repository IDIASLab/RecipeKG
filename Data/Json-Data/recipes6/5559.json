As soon as I served it to all my family members they couldn't stop raving about how amazing this soup was. I have to agree. I loved the Southwestern Flair; it reminded me of home. I follwed this recipe to a tee and will do so again and again. I can see why this recipe was featured in USA Today. It'd be a great idea if you need something to make for LOTS of people since it is a HUGE amount of soup. Even with four of us eating there was enough left over for all of us for DAYS. And it's just as good reheated.",

I did saute onions celery & red bell pepper in EVOO to soften for a few minutes (I also sauteed the cumin & chile powder for a minute or two to help draw out their flavor) before adding the broth & chicken so I think it was pretty comparable to Pam's soup base. From that point I followed the recipe except I omitted the cheese & garnished w/ a tbp of low-fat sour cream & a lime slice. Love your recipes Pam!",

I received big complements on this very hearty soup and even though it was made at the last minute it was still delicious! I cook without wheat avoid added salt love spicy food (but have a wimpy husband) and except for chicken broth I cook without meat. Saut\u00e9 1 chopped onion and when it starts to brown add 2 stalks of chopped celery cooking until tender. On low heat I added only one tablespoon cumin and one teaspoon chili powder (feared it would be too much in the original recipe). I have fresh lemon thyme so I stirred in a bit of that in also. After the spices are warmed a bit increase heat and add about 3-4 cups of water and 3-4 packets of sodium free (and gluten free) chicken broth (Herb-ox). Add tomatoes and corn (I didn't have any jalape\u00f1o) and cook for a few minutes. My husband walked by and suggested adding leftover rice to it to get it out of the fridge (it was a good idea). I then added the rinsed beans at the end (so not to overcook already soft canned beans) and stirred in a little fresh cilantro and ground pepper before serving. My meat eater added chopped ham to his serving. Sprinkle each serving with low-fat Mexican cheese and top with a dollop of fat-free yogurt (or sour cream). Someone was in the baked corn chips so I was only able to determine they would have been a very good addition.",
