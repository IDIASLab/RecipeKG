I made half using gluten-free flour for some of my takers, and they are just as good as the others.  I did get a dozen from the whole recipe, and that way the crunchy top is the star!  Thanks for the recipe, Misty!  PS:  don't skip the step of spraying the liners!  EDIT:  I've now made these several times, the last few using gluten-free flour from King Arthur Flour.  I made half a recipe using my mini-cupcake pan and my small cookie scoop, spraying the pan with TJ's coconut oil spray, baking them for 15 minutes at 350.  I guess you could call them Pecan Pie Mini-Bites.  I like the gluten-free flour best because of the consistency it gives them.",

Without spraying, the brown sugar adheres to the liner like glue. It does NOT peel off easily. Lesson learned! SPRAY THE CUPCAKE LINERS. (You're welcome.) Other than that flub, I followed the recipe exactly and loved the end result! Very yummy! Prep was fast and easy. I'll definitely make again  I plan on doubling the recipe and baking in Texas size muffin pans. With recipe as is, I filled 18 cupcake liners about 2/3 full. Baking time for my oven was 18 minutes.",
