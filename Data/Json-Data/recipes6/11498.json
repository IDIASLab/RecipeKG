I add lots of other stuff - cinnamon and whatever fruit I've at hand that would be good in a muffin but most importantly a heaping spoonful of runny honey mixed in with the sour cream. I've made these muffins for lots of people and they've all been amazed that they're so moist and tasty without any eggs - plus they stay good for a day or two after baking (that's thanks to the honey).

Thanks to the person who provided this recipe for giving me the inspiration to try an eggless muffin for the first time. You really couldn't tell it was eggless!
