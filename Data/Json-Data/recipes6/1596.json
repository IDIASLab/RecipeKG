It was very watery and just fell to the bottom of the plate. I didn t have any rice noodles and accidentally cooked fettucine instead of linguini so the noodles were a little fatter than they should have been. That could have accounted for the fact that I thought there was an awful lot of noodles in relation to the salad. I mixed up the dressing tasted and added more Sriracha since we wanted it a little spicier. I did all the prep work in the morning. I marinated the shrimp grilled it and then into the fridge. Mixed up the dressing chopped and sliced all of the veggies and into the fridge. Right before dinner I assembled the salad for an easy evening dinner with an easy clean-up. I wouldn t add the dressing until you re ready to eat or you ll have a soggy salad. This was good but there are a lot of ingredients and a lot of chopping and slicing. Wouldn t say it s my favorite Asian noodle salad recipe on this site but we enjoyed it.",

I used olive oil in place of water in the dressing; bagged coleslaw mix in place of Napa cabbage cooked pork tenderloin in place of shrimp regular cucumber in place of English cucumber and cashews in place of peanuts in the salad. I initially rated four stars...but given that I didn't have any of the fresh herbs...and subbed the veggies...I'm sure that this salad would easily be five stars with fresh herbs and the specified veggies. Notes...#1 Follow the directions on the box for cooking the noodles. #2 As I'm cooking for one and knew I wud have leftovers I sprinkled the noodles and the pork with the dressing before assembling my salad at dinnertime and putting the leftover of both into the fridge for the next night so I did make more dressing the next night. #3 I mixed the full amount of carrots and cabbage for my leftovers but added the green onions and cucumbers at serving #4 I'll prolly increase the green onion next time...and might put a layer of salad greens or just plain iceberg under. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe! PS: Also didn't use bean sprouts...haven't been available around here at least not on a regular basis since the contamination scare a few years ago.",
