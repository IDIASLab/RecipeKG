I used half butter and half shortning so my cookies wouldn't spread into pancakes. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown so that they would be a little softer. Doubled up on the vanilla to put back the moisture lacking in the shortning. After this they turned out perfect. They spread a bit but are still nice and puffy with no crunch at all! Excellent recipe with a few mod will be making again.",

Ugh I really thought they would be good but my first batch spread so much that the whole pan was a big cookie so when i took it off it wasn't even totally cooked. So for the next batch I made the balls smaller and I cooked it for 2 minutes longer. They turned out as flat crispy \"cookies\". My family tried them and said that they were too rich and buttery. They were easy enough to make but cleaning the pan was a nightmare. I would not reccomed this recipe to any one with tastebuds.",
