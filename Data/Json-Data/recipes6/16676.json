I have been making it ever since and get great reviews from it. It works great in a cookie bouquet I have even had someone tell me that these were better than the Cookie by design cookies ( I think so too). I haven't tried the frosting recipe though because I already have a special frosting I use but these cookies are to die for. One thing to keep in mind when making these cookies is using the right amount of flour. If you use your flour after you have fluffed it up then it won't be enough but if you pack it in the cup it will be too much put just enough into your measuring cup. Thank You so much for these fantastic cookies!!",

I used real butter and used 3 sticks and only 1/4 cup of shortening. Over the time I have tested cookie recipes I have discovered when you have baking powder in recipe change it to cream of tarter. I am telling you this makes the cookies. Also if you soften your butter on the counter verses in microwave your cookies are much softer and fluffier! I also used vanilla verses lemon. Will try lemon next time.. I love love love this cookie recipe!!!",

I REALLY liked these sugar cookies. I made them with vanilla instead of lemon juice because I wasn't looking for a lemon flavor for Christmas cookies. They were very yummy even without icing. Or should I say especially without icing. I found them to be a dense cookie instead of what folks might call light which I really liked. They had a good crunch and wonderful flavor. When baked they held the cookie shape very well. I made the dough early to fit my schedule and put it in the fridge for several hours only because I wasn't ready to cut and cook when I prepared the dough. I found that it took warming the dough by simply playing with it a little bit before I could easily roll it for cutting. I will make these again and again and for no special occasion. Although Santa will be getting them from now on!! I look forward to trying the lemon juice.",

I do however us an ice cream scoop to place them on the cookie sheet a flat bottom glass which has been dipped in a sugar and cinnamon mixture to flatten out the cookie to my desired thickness and size. I have refrig my dough between batches to keep the dough from becoming too soft.
