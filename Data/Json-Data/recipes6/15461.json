I used one or two slices of peach per roll, depending on the size of the peach slices. I used the leftover juice from the can, which ended up to be about 1/2 a cup of juice, and used cranberry juice to fill to the rest of the 3/4. This was fantastic, and made my house smell delicious! Will definately make again!!",
