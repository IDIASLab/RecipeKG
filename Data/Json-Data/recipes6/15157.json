It is nessesary.2 I think you will fall in love with pecan pie all over again if you use a teaspoon of cinnamon in the filling. 3 Try using a shortcake cookie crust instead of the traditional. Keep this crust moist as it will cook for 40-45 min when you bake the pie. You may also put a cookie sheet under the pie to reduce the chance of an over cooked crust.4 the last tip. If you find that your pecan pie is a bit sticky instead of having a slightly firm body add one Table spoon of all purpose flour to your base or filling mixture. I hope that these tips are helpful!! Try them you will be in for a real Treat!!!!!!!!",

Oh I also covered top with tinfoil after 30 minutes of baking so the top wouldn't scorch. I unfortunatelly am forced to use an electric oven that has a heat coil. This coil has murdered many a meal at my house. So for any of you who have the same kind of evil electric oven tinfoil can save you too:)",

I had to make 2 pecan pies so after reading the many reviews I decided to try one pie according to the recipe and one with the flour vanilla and cinnamon additions. Both pies tasted very good. I did prefer the pie with flour added because I personally don't like a pecan pie to drip with syrup as the one without flour did. The vanilla was a great touch. I didn't find the cinnamon to be necessary though. I sure did like all the extra pecans this recipe calls for!",

I'll just tweak it a bit with chocolate chips or dried fruit if I ever feel like a slightly different taste.  I made it because I liked how the other reviewers pointed out how nutty it came out.  I don't like too much pale colored, sloppy \"goo\".  I used dark corn syrup because I like the filling a little richer.  Instead of placing the plain pecan halves on top, I mixed them in a sauce pan with honey, butter and brown sugar.  I put the honey crunch mixture on top during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I highly recommend doing that.  Everyone died for it--so amazing!  Thanks Ingrid!",

Sugar\n1 cup light Karo syrup\n1/4 teas. salt\n1/2 stick melted butter (Use real butter!)\n2 teas. Pure vanilla extract\n1 1/2- 2 cups large pecan pieces\nPour this mixture into unbaked crust and bake at 350 degrees for 45 min.- 1 hr. (Middle should not jiggle.)\nIt is also a good idea to cover the edges of the pie crust with foil after about 30 min. So they do not get too brown.\nYou can serve this pie hot or cold.",
