Taking some other reviewers' advice, I took the bread out at 45 min. to glaze and then returned it to the oven for the last 5 or so minutes.  I also altered the glaze- I used one tablespoon sugar and one tablespoon honey to make the flaor more interesting.  In the batter, I zested an entire lemon, so there was no shortage of lemony flavor.  In addition, I cut the sugar to half a cup, used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour just for kicks, replaced the milk with the same amount of pureed orange (more citrus, yum!) and replaced all the butter with applesauce.  With so many alterations I was a little unsure when I popped it into the oven, but boy was I wrong to doubt.  This recipe is excellent, thank you so much.",

Didn't use the walnuts.. this reminds me of one of my mum's recipies.. I also substituted finely grated orange rind instead of lemon but I would recommend actually cooking the orange/lemon rind in the glaze mixture before adding it to the batter. Orange can be a bit bitter. Still its a great recipe with a few simple ingredients. Love it!",
