I used extra broth though as well, (40 oz). The squash took 10 min to cool, probably could have microwaved it for less time and nexttime I'll prick squash to make some vents. Overall this tasted really good, even though I didn't have fontina cheese and used Marsala wine.",

Couldn't find fontina cheese so I used jalape\u00f1o gouda, oh and more cheese please, about 1/2C each. I prefer to bake my squash and make my own broth, so this takes me about 2.5hrs but it's so worth it!! I made it for the 2nd time today and added fresh peas for myself and fried up some pancetta for the hubby to top it with. Good ideas all around. Will make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!! Well done!",
