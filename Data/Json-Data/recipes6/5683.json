I simply fried it with the vegetables, adding 1 large chopped carrot. I also used evaporated milk instead of the cream as I had planned to freeze some of it for later use. My friends on the Buzz recommended the canned milk as it won't seem curdled when I reheat the chowder from it's frozen state. I shared the soup with my sick brother and he loved it too. He was able to eat two ladles full and relished every bite. Now, that's success! Thanks again!",

We like our chowders a bit thicker so I used a cornstarch slurry just to tighten it up a little (I had no creamed corn on hand).
