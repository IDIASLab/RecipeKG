Doubled the vinegar and halved the oil.  Added some fresh basil, lemon zest, zucchini (yellow and green) and red bell pepper.  Excellent refreshing side dish for a summer meal.  My daughter and wife both went for more.  I served it with the catfish cakes I also found at allrecipes.com.   ",

They are a little easier on your tummy that way but still nice and crunchy.  I changed up the veggies a bit to use up a few things I had on hand - skipped the mushrooms, added green and kalamata olives, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, celery, and pepperoncinis. I also added some pepper and crushed red pepper to the dressing. I would definitely make this again - and maybe try adding feta cheese and chopped pepperoni. Yum!",
