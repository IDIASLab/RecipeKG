I had leftover cooked chicken and some mushrooms in the refrigerator that I needed to use. I had pasta in the pantry, but alas, no cream, so this dish kind of \"grew like Topsy\" with ingredients I already had on hand--a partial bottle of white wine, frozen peas, and parsley right outside the door. My son said, \"Hey, this is almost like carbonara,\" and the name was born!",

I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and halved the recipe since it's just the two of us. I found the seasonings and chicken to pasta ratio perfect. Randy suggested adding oil-packed sundried tomatoes to the dish next time. We always have a jar in the fridge or pantry for my sun-dried lovin' husband!\n I'm looking forward to leftovers of this tasty 'pantry pull'! Well done, my friend!",
