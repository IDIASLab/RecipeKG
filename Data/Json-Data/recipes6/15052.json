I was pumped to try this! I figured a recipe this well-recognized and that has stood the test of time has got to be good. But it wasn t for me. While the flavor really was quite good I found this heavy as a brick overly sweet and soaked with butter. I had plans for a nice finish on this cake but it didn t happen as I ended up tossing it. For those who still would like to try it keep in mind that certain brands have sneakily reduced the volume in the box of a vanilla wafers from 12 ounces to 11 ounces. To make up the difference you may want to do as I did and add 2 T. of flour. (I noticed that Vanilla Wafer Cake IV also from this site is essentially the same recipe but calls for 1/2 cup less of both sugar and butter and just might be a better bet)",
