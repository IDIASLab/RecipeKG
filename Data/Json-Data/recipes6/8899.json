( they have visible flecks of butter in them). It's a 14 oz. can. I used the entire can. I tore them into large pieces  and scattered them on the bottom of the greased pan. I used Pioneer brand Country Sausage flavor gravy mix and shredded Co jack cheese.  Loved it! I will try Sharp cheddar cheese next time just to try it.\n**UPDATE**. This was a huge hit on Christmas day! Everyone devoured it. Some said they went back for 3rds.\nI made 2 pans the night before up to the gravy point then I stopped. I covered the pans with saran wrap and refrigerated them overnight. While the oven was preheating the next day I pulled the pans out of the refrigerator and set them on the counter. Then I made the gravy, poured it on top of the casseroles and baked. After they came out of the oven I let them rest for 10 minutes before serving.\nI also used tin throw away pans you buy in the store for easy clean up.",

It becomes more like a biscuit casserole rather than a gravy casserole and doesn't have that wonderful creamy gravy you want in this dish. Use regular biscuits (I used a 12 oz. can of flaky). I used Jimmy Dean 1/2 hot and 1/2 regular sausage. I also made my own gravy with 4 tbsp butter heated with 4 tbsp of flour and slowly poured in 2 cups of milk , brought to a boil until a creamy consistency and added salt and pepper to taste. I assembled everything in a 9X12 glass dish the night before except for the gravy. The next morning I warmed up the gravy, poured it over the top and  cooked for 38 minutes (after the 3rd time, I found this to be the perfect time)  SO much better! When I used Grands, my company liked it OK, but when I made it again, they sucked it up with rave reviews. Next time I'll take the suggestion to add the sausage drippings to the gravy. Yum!",

One can of biscuits only covered half the casserole so I used two cans, and I used 7 eggs instead of 6. Otherwise I followed the directions to a tee. I used Grands biscuits and they rose so much that my casserole nearly overflowed. Will definitely make again. Gravy gave it a nice creamy texture that you don't get with more traditional breakfast casseroles that only have potatoes, sausage, and eggs.  **Made this second time using Grands Frozen Southern Style  biscuits and it didn't turn out as well.  It tasted okay but the biscuits rose toward the sides and created a crater of sorts in the middle, causing the gravy to pool in the middle.  We still ate it all but I'll just stick to the refrigerated kind like the first time I made it.",
