They baked beautifully in 24 minutes, and gave me exactly 24 cupcakes! I liked the simple vanilla flavor, but I may add more vanilla extract with a touch of almond next time. I served the cupcakes with whipped cream and some macerated berries for an almost shortcake-like effect--and they were wildly popular! Thank you so much for the recipe!",
