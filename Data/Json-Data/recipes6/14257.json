Having said that, I do have some changes to make this recipe a definite winner!  First, use brown sugar. I have tried it with both types of sugar, and white not only tastes different, but the end product doesn't even LOOK appetizing.  I use normal saltines, not anything fancy. Do not overcook your sugar/butter, it WILL burn.  3 minutes is plenty. Do not overcook in the oven...5 minutes is just fine.  I have tried different flavored chips (Reese's, milk chocolate, etc) as well, and have learned to stick with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Just sprinkle onto the hot crackers after removing from the oven, and let them sit for a couple of minutes....they will melt enough to spread over entire pan of crackers from corner to corner. Here is a trick of mine that works for an easier, prettier finished product: Once they have cooled slightly in the pan, score slightly with a knife right down the dotted lines of the cracker edges to make squares.  Once they are cooled completely, use the scored lines to cut into neat squares! I have never failed with these, even when they weren't as \"pretty\" as I'd like...they still taste wonderful!",

                "reviewBody": "I highly recommend making the toffee layer with light brown sugar.  It truly gives the candy a Skor taste.  The first time I made this tasty treat, it didn't turn out quite so tasty.  I had used white granulated sugar and followed the recipe exactly.  The consistency of the toffee seemed odd even after 5 minutes.  I decided not to rate the recipe based on that experience, since I'm sure I was largely at fault.  I saw a recommendation for brown sugar and decided to try it out.  The end result was absolute perfection.  Make sure that you use the salted saltines.  The saltiness helps to balance the sweetness of the toffee.  I only used one cup of chocolate chips and it was enough for me.  I prefer more toffee anyway.  I also used crushed, toasted almonds.  One very important thing...make sure to lay wax paper under the crackers.  The toffee soaks through and was a pain to wash.  Let the candy sit for about 10 minutes on the counter, then slide it into the freezer for about 20-30 minutes.  Pick the candy up by the wax paper and break away pieces.  Store the candy in the fridge or place a few pieces in the freezer for 20 minutes for extra crunchiness.  Yum!",

It is excellent made w/ the white sugar ( tho' many seem to prefer brown who rated this). MY RECIPE of it directs you w/ specific times for EVERYTHING! You LINE a broiler pan w/ foil and arrange your crackers ( my recipe called for unsalted saltines). Melt butter and sugar and boil for \" 3 minutes\". Pour over saltines and bake at 400 degrees for \" 5 minutes\"..Immediately sprinkle the choc chips over this evenly..pop back in oven for 2 min or less. This spreads the chocolate very easily over entire top of candy.. Sprinkle your choice nuts on top. FREEZE.. ( have to FREEZE them solid)..then break into pcs and store in airtight containers. The odd shapes they come out when broken up make them even more interesting. I always make these for Christmas baskets w/ a copy of the recipe attached. EVERYONE loves them. Oh...and when you take them out of freezer.. lift foil sheet out.. invert and peel candy off foil. Put pan away.. hey i'ts clean!",
