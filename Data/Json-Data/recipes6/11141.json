You have to use parchment for this recipe.\r\n\r\nThird, the cakes do not rise.  Italian cream cake is NOT supposed to be this dense.  This was like a dry, greasy brownie.\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n1.  Use 1/2 tsp of salt, not 1 tsp of baking powder and, most importantly:  \r\n\r\n2.  THE EGGS SHOULD BE SEPARATED.  Blend the yolks in with the butter, shortening, and sugar, but don't add the buttermilk until you add the SIFTED flour, alternating both in small batches.  \r\n\r\nOnce the batter is mixed, beat the remaining egg whites until stiff peaks form, then fold this mixture into the batter gently.  You may also add chopped nuts to the cake batter.\r\n\r\nThese solutions will then fill three PARCHMENT LINED 9-inch cake pans, and when baked at 325 for 25 minutes, will turn out a true light, springy version of Italian Cream Cake.\r\n\r\nIf you like the original recipe, that's great, but please, just don't call it \"Italian Cream Cake.\"  Because it isn't.",

                "reviewBody": "Hi there,\nI made this tonight. It was really good and much admired by the crowd.  I made the following changes:  I added 1/4 cup oil to the batter based on the \"thick\" comments I read on other reviews.  On the icing, I forgot that others said that it wouldn't cover the whole cake easily, so I doubled the icing recipe, except I only had 8 oz of cream cheese so I got it the right consistency by adding cream till it worked well instead of an extra thing of cream cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time is possibly 1.5 the the recipe so that the 3 cake pans were fully loaded.  When completed, I cut it like the restaurants do, so the pieces in the middle were all yummy and perfect, but the the perimeter pieces were a little dried out as they were too thin and got a little more done.  It really was quite good.  \n\nI found this review in the saved file, I just made it again on 8/26/08, again it was very good.  I would say though, about the negative ratings, as a cook it always bothers me when people take a recipe, remove ingredients and then give things a bad rating.  I know people who don't share their recipes for just this reason.  If you *do* get their recipes, they have one motto:  Make it exactly how it says in the instructions the first time, then after that do anything you want.  It's a soapbox, but it's only fair.  ",
