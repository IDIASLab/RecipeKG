I soaked my raisins in just enough wine to cover them (3/4 cup instead of 2 cups) and soaked them overnight. If you get the raisins that are moist packed just for baking you will need even less wine to soak. I cut the cinnamon back to 2 tsp but 2 1/2 tsp would have been fine. I used lemon extract and no vanilla. I would make these again.",
