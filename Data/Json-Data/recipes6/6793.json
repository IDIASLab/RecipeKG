Parsley does not need to be your only spice.  I used a Sicilian blend that I got from an oil and vinegar store which has onion, oregano, red pepper, green pepper, basil.  Next time I'd like to try these croutons and replace the butter with my pesto oil or Tuscan oil.  The time for the air fryer was spot on and they look and tasted great.  I cut the crust off of my bread and the dog enjoyed it...lol.  So much easier to make croutons this way!",
