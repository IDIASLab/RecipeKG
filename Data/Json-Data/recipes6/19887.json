I just disolved the pectin in it before adding it to the grape juice.  I also did the plate in the freezer trick to ensure it was ready.  Place a plate in the freezer during cooking, when sugar is disolved take the plate out and drop a half teaspoon of the jelly onto the plate.  Wait one minute and push it with your fingernail.  If it wrinkles, it's ready to jar!  Great recipe!",

I have read that liquid pectin produces a fresher fruit taste. In any case homemade grape jelly is the best!!!",
