Since I have never seen pasteurized egg in the grocery store I mixed 2 eggs with 1/2 cup of the icing sugar and cooked it over the stove until very hot then added it to the other hard sauce ingredients.

Super tender and moist and the blueberries just pop with every bite. The amount of the hard sauce seemed excessive to me since I knew that we simply would be drizzling it on the top so I cut the sauce amounts in half used Egg Beaters for the pasteurized egg s cutting back just a bit on that and even reduced the amount of the confectioners sugar a little. Ended up with a very very good dessert which I wouldn t hesitate to serve to company.",
