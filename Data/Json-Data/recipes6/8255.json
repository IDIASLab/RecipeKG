Skipped the seasoned salt and used salt and pepper and also added it to the gravy. Put in a few cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon of Thyme. Served it with rice and steamed broccoli for a balanced meal. Will probably try this with cubed steak or stew meat and use beef broth instead of chicken. 5 stars as is!",
