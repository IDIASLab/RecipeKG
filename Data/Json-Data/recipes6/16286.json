This recipe is great. The only thing I did different and proably everyone else knew to do this - but I have never, ever cooked cabbage - I did add salt and pepper and covered it to help wilt the cabbage faster.  Not for too long and when thoroughly cooked, it was still a little crisp and delicious.  I loved it and my family did as well. I am 67 y/o and considered to be a good cook in my circle, but this recipe absolutely tops all of mine.  Thank you so very much.  A fan!",

I would not omit the vinegar, as in such a small amount compared to the volume of cabbage, i dont feel that it could be offensive. but i do think it adds a subtle and important flavor. I also suggest increasing the amount of bacon to your taste. I mean, its bacon, so the more the merrier. i used 5 slices. also, this is one of those dishes that makes for leftovers that get better and better.\r\n",
