                "reviewBody": "Nice flavors in this recipe and a time saver instead of baking the potatoes for an hour in the oven! My husband enjoyed these too and asked for the recipe to be a repeat! I lost 1 LB Yukon Gold potatoes and only had about 1 1/4 LB potatoes to use. Although I scaled the recipe in half, I still used 1 cup of water (I was concerned if the IP would come to pressure with less than 1 cup in it). The potatoes were perfectly tender and not mushy. I left all other adjusted ingredient amounts the same. I subbed heavy cream with unsweetened almond milk and used Cabot LF/GF White Cheddar Cheese to accommodate my dietary restrictions. I may have used slightly more than 1/4 cup cheddar on top as I manually grated my cheese, which was more of a fine grate. The end result was a little too much sauce, but it was not an excessive amount and can be easily rectified by not adding all of the sauce if you use less potatoes. My only real change would be to stir the potatoes a little to ensure the potatoes are evenly coated with the sauce, which is what I did. I\u2019ll definitely make this again and as written with 2 LB potatoes, but I think the amount of sauce will be perfect. I\u2019ll be sure to update my review though if the result is different. Overall, an easy to make recipe with delicious flavor and easy to adjust if you have any dietary restrictions. Definitely will make this recipe again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I live at 800' altitude, fwiw.\n\nGreat recipe, thanks!",
