I've never had one turn out soupy or rubbery.",

I thought this was absolutely delicious... with a few adjustments :) I followed the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and sliced my strawberries (they were from the farmer's market, so they were different sizes). I also added a lemony cream cheese layer on the bottom which was a fantastic counterpoint to the sweetness. One more thing- homemade crust and real whipped cream are an absolute MUST with this recipe. Store bought crust and Cool Whip just won't cut it... Everyone was absolutely raving and wanted the recipe immediately!",

I thought I had completely screwed it up, as the glaze mix quickened very quickly (came to a boil very fast and I didn;t mean for it to) but then was runny after I added the jello. So I heated it back up again to thicken it. Heating it the second time seemed to help it set quickly; it seemed to be setting as it cooled so I just poured it over the strawberries and refrigerated. It was very set and I had no problems with it not gelling. I did as some reviewers suggested and doubled the sauce. Not sure if I like it that way; it did almost overflow the pan. Very good, and everyone at the bbq I went to tonight liked it.  ",

The crust is just exceptional with this pie. Yes as other reviewers pointed out the filling does become slightly rubbery in the second day - but it would take more than a little consistency change to keep me from eating it. If you love strawberries try this recipe - you won't regret it. It rocks! Addendum: It's been three years since I last prepared this. I don't remember not having enough glaze the first time but when preparing two pies--ABSOLUTELY double the glaze.",
