I deleted the butter-flavored extract because I don't like having to use artifical ingredients (plus I didn't have any!):-) I also added about a cup of raisins. The tea bread came out dark spicey moist on the inside crunchy on the outside. Careful though! Test it well before taking it out of the oven. I had to bake my two loaves for 65 minutes. Perhaps because the temperature was 325. Nevertheless it is a delight! Oh yes...I also used my leftover jack-o-lantern to make the puree for this tea bread. I'm glad I still have some puree left. Think I know what I'll do with it!:-)",

I also use only one and a half cups of sugar and leave out the mace and butter-flavor extract entirely as I cannot get either of those ingredients.
