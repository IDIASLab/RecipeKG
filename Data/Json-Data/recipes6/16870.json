Several people went out of their way to say that they don't normally like cole slaw but loved this recipe. I did make a few changes however. I increased the blue cheese to give it a little more bite...about 1/2 cup in the dressing with additional sprinkled on top. Also I added salt and pepper (maybe this addition is just sort of \"understood\" but it wasn't in the recipe). Finally I added about 3/4 cup of toasted coarsely chopped pecans.",

Also instead of using just a cabbage cole slaw I used a \"stir fry\" mix which was basically cabbage carrots and zucchini. Served it with steak and it was absolutely perfect! See picture.",
