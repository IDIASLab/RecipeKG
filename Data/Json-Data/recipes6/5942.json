I've made it since with increasing/decreasing ingredients leaving different ones out or adding new ones in - as long as I am using the main flavor ingredients it's a very forgiving recipe. Lots of fun to tweak in different ways! When I use italian sausage I use tomatoes with italian seasoning and serve with garlic bread and when I use chorizo I use tomatoes with green chilies (ro-tel's the most flavorful!) and serve with homemade cornbread. Like I said - very versatile!",
