You might think with all the butter it's sure to taste amazing, but I've made better recipes before with less butter and they tasted just as good, some even better.

But there is one very misleading ingredient here...6 sweet potatoes. 6 of the small thin tubers...or 6 of the huge almost football size that I buy locally that are still tender to the skin? I quickly realized that 6 would feed half of our small community and dropped it to 4...then could only get three into my large pot. I weighed them and they came to 3 lbs. So 3 lbs. of sweet potatoes is much more accurate. Those pies sure disappeared quickly and deserved every one of those stars!!!",
