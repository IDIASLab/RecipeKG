But this has got to be one of the top two kofta recipes I have had...and since the other is a secret...the only one I can now personally make at home. Thanks Bob & Chef John for bringing this one to us. I pared the Kofta with Briam (Baked Zucchini and Potatoes - search recipe on this website) and the combo made a perfect Mediterranean meal. BTW...if you can't find the Sumac or Aleppo Pepper in your local store, both are available online.  They do make a difference and are worth the effort.  Enjoy!",

I had a larger group to feed, so I used two pounds of lamb and one of ground pork, which worked out really well. I think the flavoring was just about perfect with a nice crust on the outside and plenty of juicy texture inside. I'll definitely be coming back to these kabobs and I'd like to try a few different sauces to accompany them as well. The sauce here was a very simple one, and quite tasty, but I'd like to see how this pairs with a tzatziki or aioli. Great recipe as usual, Chef (and Bob)! I just wish I had taken some pictures before we devoured it all.",
