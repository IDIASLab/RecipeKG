So simple full of flavor and the perfect dish for a hot summer day. Very light and refreshing. The only change I might make next time would be to use a little less lemon juice in the marinade because the chicken seemed very lemony to me. However once all components of the salad were put together the flavors seemed to balance. I used mixed green salad blend as that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for another fantastic recipe Bren!",

I love souvlaki and tzatziki so I checked this recipe to see if it offered an sort of unique spin that might be worthy of changing my tried and true recipe.  \n\n\nThis recipe is inadequate, IMO, because it calls for two items with no explanation, tzatziki sauce and \"Greek Seasoning\".  \n\n\nI know in some stores you can find pre-made tzatziki, but it isn't all that common in my experience.  It isn't hard to make and is good on many things.  The recipe would have been more complete with instructions to prepare this. \n\n\nAnd what is \"Greek Seasoning\"?  Yes, there are several spices that are common in Greek cooking, but saying Greek Seasoning would be like a recipe for Tiki Masala including, \"Indian Seasoning\" or Crepes Suzette calling for \"French Seasoning\".",
