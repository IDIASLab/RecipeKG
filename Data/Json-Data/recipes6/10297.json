I ended up using 4 packets of Rapid Rise Yeast because that's all I had.  All purpose flour worked fine as well. I let it rise for an hour in between each step and the cinnamon rolls rose an extra 35 minutes while the bread baked.\n\nMade 2 nice loaves and a big batch of 18 cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing. YUM!\n\n We ate a whole loaf with Peasant soup for dinner and had a cinnamon roll for dessert! I am so full! \n\nNice tangy taste and wonderful texture, don't miss out TRY IT!!!",

But if you add 3tbl of gluten flour, a tablespoon of vitamin c and an egg, they act as preservatives and keep the bread soft and fresh for longer than a week. I never buy bread anymore, and the daycare kids LOVE this recipe.     I did just about everything wrong with this and it still is the best bread recipe I've ever made.  I didn't let it set a sponge, I added 1/4 cup oil (reading too fast) didn't let it rise until double and it made the BEST ever cinnamon rolls and pizza.  This is fool proof, as I have proven.",

My son loves to cook and was amazed at the process and simplicity at making the perfect homemade white bread-think I have a budding chef! I have been looking for this recipe all my life! I wanted an EASY bread -not from a breadmaker -(there's nothin' like the feel of kneading fresh dough!) I am sooo pleased! As others have said it freezes so well (I am going to attempt freezing dough, after 1st rise, so we have fresh from the oven...!) If you want a simple, delectable and versatile bread (rosemary/thyme, cinnamon/raisin, cheddar, etc..), the possibilities are endless-this is your bread!! I actually got four good sized loaves!! There should be 10 stars for this one! P.S. to Ms. Sim-I met a lady a long time ago who had a 'secret' family recipe from her grandmother for the most delicious homemade olives I have ever had (and I DON'T LIKE them!) Anyway, she would be a little self centered w/ the attention whenever asked for the recipe (many did). She died a few years ago along w/her family olive recipe. She had no children or siblings. So her grandmothers wonderful recipe is lost. I am TRULY grateful to you who share these family treasures. I hope Grandma Van Doren is pleased w/ all the VERY happy children she is feeding!! My best to you!",
