Use a \r\n     food processor to expedite this part of the recipe.\r\n2.  make sure that the oats are ground completely.  I usually empty the\r\n     blender and add them again.\r\n3.  I find that people are just as happy without the nuts, and some people\r\n     either can't eat nuts or hate them in cookies.  Leaving out the nuts will\r\n     improve overall acceptance.\r\n4.  It may be obvious to people who really know how to cook, but these\r\n     cookies turn out much better when you hand mix the ingredients.  Ok,\r\n     maybe it's my own superstition, but I really believe this...stick your bar\r\n     hands in there and really \"feel the dough\".\r\n5.  I always cool the dough before rolling into balls...it makes it easier to\r\n     roll into balls, and the slighty chilled dough seems to improve the final\r\n     shape of the cookies (no idea why, but seems to work).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I cut the recipe in half--I don't need 52 cookies My boyfriend doesn't like nuts so I omitted them and doubled the amount of chocolate chips (cut chocolate chips by 1/2 instead of 1/4). Powderizing the oatmeal was a great idea--it lends a unique and very subtle flavor to the cookie. I made the entire process much easier by adding in the chocolate (not chocolate chips) with the oatmeal instead of grating it by hand. I also threw in 1/4 C of almonds while powderizing the oatmeal and chocolate-the texture is subtle enough that my boyfriend didn't notice. I also added 1 teaspoon EACH of cinnamon nutmeg and ginger. It lends a slightly spicy taste that pairs very well with the grated chocolate. Please follow the cooking time--10 minutes for a smaller cookie 12 minute for the larger ones. Grease the cookie sheet WELL and wait at least 5-10 minute for the cookie to cool before removing them from the sheet--otherwise they crumble. After they are cooled however they're not very crumbly and can easily be packaged and shipped.",
