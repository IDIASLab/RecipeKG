We're vegetarian and it's difficult to find a black bean soup in restaurants that's not made with chicken stock or doesn't have bacon.  Now I can make the black bean soup that my husband loves so much right at home.  Upon other reviewers suggestions, I saved one cup of beans to add whole, I added 3 teaspoons lime juice, triple the cumin, 1 teaspoon garlic, freshly chopped cilantro and 1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper.  I also used the immersion blender and blended the soup right in the pot (talk about a great invention!).  The soup came out perfect and tasted great with quesadillas.  Next time, I'll probably saute some onions and add some corn for a different taste in the soup.  Thanks very much for this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!!",

We linked that ingredient to a more generic vegetable broth, and it seems to have reduced the sodium.

I used 1 can low fat low sodium chicken broth and 1 can Rotel instead of the salsa.  I also sauteed some sweet Vidalia onion and garlic before adding beans, broth, and Rotel.  I added cumin, dash red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder.  Then I used a hand held blender (Emeril calls it the boat motor) and blended until I got the consistency I wanted.  Then added the reserved whole black beans.  I left lid off pot and let it simmer to reduce the amount of liquid and concentrate the flavors.  At the very end I added the juice of a lime.  It was delicious.  Great base recipe to add your favorite flavors! When serving I added a dollop of no fat sour cream and some chopped green onions. A meal in itself! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I was disappointed and threw the soup away as it was inedible. Someone in the house thought it could be salvaged as a dip but I have better recipes for that. Still looking for a good vegetarian Black Bean soup.",
