I selected this sancocho recipe because it was vegetarian and I was familiar with all the ingredients except yuca which I was able to find at my regular not-particularly-fancy grocery store (and was able to cut with my not-particularly-sharp knives.) I thought it would end up being a bit bland because of the lack of spices but IT WAS DELICIOUS! Five folks ate with us and everyone loved it. I meant to take a picture of it so I could post it here but forgot. Sorry. Served it big shallow bowls with a scoop of plain white rice (in the same bowl) and sprinkled with cilantro. It plated very nicely and the corn on the cob chunks gave it a special flair. I'll definitely make this again. Thank you for posting lllilliputian!",
