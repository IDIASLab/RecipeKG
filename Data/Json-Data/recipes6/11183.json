The batter is very thin so you want to either make sure the crust is pressed up the sides of the pan at least 2\" or place foil around pan to catch any leaks. Also one hour in the oven at 250 did not do it at all. I have a new oven and it took at least 90 minutes. I tried 2 different toppings; one fruit and one chocolate but the cake has a strange consistency. Not sure I would make it again.",

We made a plain crust instead of gingerbread. I think the caramelish flavor would be a lot better with gingerbread for a winter treat. Did not taste good with blueberry topping. We also learned not to try to bake a cheesecake on pizza night...not compatible in the oven. This was a somewhat complicated recipe. I would not do this again. But I cannot fault the recipe itself. We did not read carefully enough before we started.",
