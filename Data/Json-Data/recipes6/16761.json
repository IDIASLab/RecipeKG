These rolls are the best.\r\n\r\nWhen slicing the logs into individual rolls, use dental floss instead of a knife.  The rolls don't get squashed and the cut is cleaner and easier.  Use about 18\".  Put the floss under the roll.  Holding each end of the floss, bring them up criss-cross over the log and pull in opposite directions.  Kinda like a tonsillectomy, I'm told!

Make certain you do not boil the caramel, or else the caramel mixture will harden!  Do as the recipe says, and stir in the corn syrup after the mixture has been taken off the heat source.",

I read the reviews and noticed a couple said it needed less butter, so I skipped putting the butter on the rolled out dough. Next time I'll make it exactly as directed. Also, I made my rolls in 3 round pans, and did only one with pecan halves because so many in our family say they don't like nuts, next time I'm going to make them all with the nuts, everyone grabbed for those first and it seemed to protect the rolls from browning too much. I also used parchment paper in the bottem of my pans because someone suggested it was hard to clean, but I think if you just pop the pans right into water for a few minutes after removing the rolls, you won't have any problems with cleanup. Great recipe, thanks Andrea.",

I also added 1/2 a cup of toasted chopped pecans into the filling. I learned a great technique to make a warm area for the dough to rise: I put the dough and a coffee mug of freshly boiled water into the microwave (don't turn it on). The hot water makes the inside of the microwave the perfect tempertature and humidity for the dough to rise perfectly! I didn't wait overnight, I just let them rise a second time for 30 minutes in the micro again and then baked right away. Mine only took 25 minutes in the oven. EXCELLENT!!!",

I lightly greased two bundt pans, put finely chopped pecans and a handful of coconut in the bottom. Then I made the caramel sauce and put that on top of that. Then I took the dough and divided it as specified and made little balls and put that on top of the sauce. Then I followed the directions after that... covering, putting in fridge and baking in the morning, instantly flipping it out to let the sauce cover that rolls. \nIt is beautiful and tasty! ",

Seventeen accomplished cooks and bakers raved over these and requested the recipe!  I made a double batch (four dozen), and made a couple changes. One inadvertent one was that I used cornstarch instead of baking powder by accident (the red Rumford cans look the same!). It didn't seem to hurt the finished product one bit, though.  I also doubled the amount of the caramel for each recipe at the suggestion of others here, and was glad I did. It was just the right amount and wouldn't have been enough if I hadn't doubled it.  Also, I generously slathered the dough with a \"cinnamon butter\" made with the cinnamon, butter and BROWN sugar instead of the white. The cinnamon I used was 2 percent oil, too, so had a nice strong cinnamon presence. Combing the three ingredients was easier.  As to the pan cleaning? Use disposable medium-weight foil pans sprayed with Pam. The rolls slip right out when inverted (leave the pan on for a few minutes to allow all the caramel to run over rolls) and the pan gets crumpled up and tossed away!  I'm going to make them again for Christmas morning. Great recipe!",

They were overcooked and dry so that is the first thing to watch for. I also didn't think there was enough caramel topping and that it wasn't thick enough. If I make these again I'd probably double the topping and make it thicker with more brown sugar/butter ratio.",
