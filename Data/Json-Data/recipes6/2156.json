This had just the right amount of sweetness for me, and the juicy blueberries just pop in your mouth.  A great, tasty breakfast and a filling one, too. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

It is not as sweet as other recipes (though I still might cut a bit of sugar next time, just for personal preference) and it cooks up quickly.  I believe this would also be a very adaptable dish.  I used frozen berries and it was phenomenal and I'm sure it would awesome with whatever fresh or frozen fruit you have on hand.  The chia seeds give this a special texture and I love that it is a decent serving of whole grains.  Wonderful!",
