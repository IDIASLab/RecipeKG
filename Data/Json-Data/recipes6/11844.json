The walnut crust is way too thick and just tastes dry and crunchy not flavorful. The \"cheescake\" filling is anything but it's more like a suggestion of what cheesecake could taste like. Lemon? How can you taste a hint of lemon flavoring when the whole thing tastes like nuts? This recipe was baked by me and tested by my husband and a friend. They both hated it but not as much as me. I wasted my evening baking time cleaning dishes including the one left after I threw these things away. Sorry they just suck.",

I increased the amount of cream cheese to a full 8 oz. package, and I was still wishing there had been more filling. I also added cinnamon to the crust/topping, and used pecans instead of walnuts. We ate them, but I'm sure that there is a better recipe out there. Sorry. :-(",
