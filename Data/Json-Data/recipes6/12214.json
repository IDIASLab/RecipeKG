If one would use an ice cream scoop to drop the cookies on to the sheet and a flat glass to flatten them (which has been dipped into a sugar and cinnamon mixture)the process is easier than rolling. These cookies just barely have time to cool and become crisp before they are gone. There have been times that I have had to put the dough in the frig on warm day or when the kitchen is hot between baking time.",
