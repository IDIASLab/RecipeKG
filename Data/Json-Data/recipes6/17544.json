She called them oil cookies because most of the recipes had lard in them and this one used oil instead. This is a recipe that is called for on every cookie tray at holidays or gatherings. Brush cookies with a basic powder sugar and water icing and while wet, sprinkle colored jimmies to match the occasion. Let dry completely before storing. These cookies freeze great UNFROSTED.",

I found it took an extra cup of flour to even get it remotely stiff enough to shape and that it didn't really rise very much(maybe because of the extra flour). With no butter to cream it was a very quick dough to make and my 4 yr old was able to roll them in to \"snakes\" and after they were cooked I brushed on the glaze and she dipped them in sprinkles. We glaced and covered them with sprinkles and the kids loved them so I would definitely make them again.",

Great group activity for baking with friends or kids because you can make whatever shapes you want out of the dough (and there is a LOT of dough so the help would be nice!). I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because I made a few adjustments and I think as-is it would only be a 4. What I did that made them GREAT was: 1) I added about 1/2 a tablespoon of almond extract along with the vanilla. 2) I ended up having to add in about 1.5 extra cups of flour... it was still a little sticky but with floured hands it was workable/rollable for shapes. 3) GLAZE! You definately need to take the advice in the recipe and glaze. The cookies are a bit bland by themselves but made complete with a little sugary goodness on top:) I used a vanilla glaze and it was the perfect pair but I bet they would be great with any other glaze or even jam! Thanks so much for this recipe I'll definately make it again:)",

I like the simplicity of this recipe and the comment that they are like scones is right on! They are a softer texture but for little teeth this is good. I just dusted them with icing sugar and while the kids made wild shapes I stuck with spirals and pretzels that looked charming when done. The taste might be bland but a solid base for whatever your imagination can create - admittedly I near tripled the vanilla since I love that flavour.",

So I very gently boiled down some 2% milk until it was reduced to half. I made only half the recipe. I put the dough in the freezer for about a half hour. Next time I will refrigerate it overnight. I put a piece of saran wrap down to roll the dough on. I dipped my fingers in flour each time I took a tablespoon of dough. Since I had some cinnamon sugar left from another cookie I made I used that rather than glaze. I ended up making knots and they looked really cute. I got about 3 dozen cookies. I baked them longer than the recipe stated because I wanted them to have more color. I'll definitely make these again. Thank you for taking the time to get measurements from your grandmother.
