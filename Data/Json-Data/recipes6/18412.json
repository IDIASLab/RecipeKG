Next time I think I'll use a 9 x 13 pan and get a thicker bar. I did use more raspberry preserves than the recipe called for, and added about 1 cup of flaked coconut to the preserves. Next time I make them, and there will most definitely be a next time, I will spread the preserves to about 1/4 inch from the edge of the bottom crust. I spread them all the way to the edge this time, and it made getting them from the pan a little tricky. For such amazing flavor and texture, this recipe was amazingly quick and easy.

I have made it no less than four times in the past three weeks for various holiday events. I always double the recipe. I pretty much make it as-is written with just a touch more flour (just enough that my batter is nice and thick). I've found that this reduces any chance for \"butter fingers\" when you're eating them. Also be sure that when your baking the bottom crust layer you get it good and golden brown.....this prevents a the jam and top layer from turning the middle of the bars too gooey. Funny that with all the white choclolate there is no white chocolate taste.....unlike other reviewers I would not make this with other kinds of chocolate.",
