I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tsp of real vanilla extract to the sauce part before I poured it over the batter. I also used fresh peeled diced peaches instead of apples and nuts because I had peaches on hand. The larger pan took 45 minutes to cook but turned out like a yummy bread pudding with rich caramel sauce.Pretty tasty! The peaches were great in this. I will try it in the fall with apples and I might try using apple cider instead of water when making the sauce to make it extra apple flavored.",

I made it twice, once as written, and once with a cut back to about 3/4 C white sugar and 1 1/2 C brown sugar. Both came out excellent with the second time being just a little less sweet. Baking for 35 minutes was perfect. I think some of the variations in oven cooking temperatures have a bearing on how the results turn out for some. I calibrate my oven to a digital thermometer occasionally to make sure it is working correctly. This recipe was quick and easy to make with ingrediants that are usually available in every kitchen and tastes like a lot more work than it is, my kind of recipe. Yummy!!",

I had my parents over for dinner and after dessert my Mom said \"this is a keeper\". I think I will modify the dish slightly next time I make it. I will double the apples and stir them into the batter rather than leave them on top. I didn't have any problem with the sauce boiling over I used a square pyrex dish and it was just the right size. Also it's not as good at room temperature or reheated as it is warm from the oven so plan accordingly.",

Mind you I substituted whole grain flour for the white and I added 1/4 cup bourbon to the sauce just before pouring it over the batter. I used apples no nuts and we served it with ice cream. Fabulous. Next time I'll make more sauce to have for the ice cream because there's no sauce left for the leftovers. Your grandmother was right (aren't they always?) This is a very easy to make keeper. Made this again on 4 Dec but had some problems. Now I understand some the previous negative reviews. It is very important not to overbake this as the sauce sort of turns to jelly not very appetizing. I added some sweetened dried cranberries Craisins doubled the amount of apple and put them in with the dry ingredients. Baked it in a larger pan but I should have taken it out at the 35 minute mark instead I left it for 40 and the sauce was not very nice.",

I'd never heard of pudding cake so I didn't know what to expect I just went from the reviews. It seemed weird how the ingredients (no eggs no oil) could turn into some kind of cake but it sure did! I gave it a shot and it's OUTSTANDING. It kinda reminded me of a big warm muffin with sauce. I didn't have any fruit but I think I would try to add them if I made this again - just for the variation.
