I use a cooking stone (as I always do) and they cooked evenly and they were chewy and yummy. My husband and I ate all of them within 2 days. They were great the next day too. They had alot of chocolate in them just as I like so if you don't like too much chocolate in it I would use maybe 3/4 cup of chocolate instead.",

I also replaced 1/2 a cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour.
