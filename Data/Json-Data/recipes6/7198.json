One thing that I do is rinse my corned beef after removing from the package mainly to remove the blood.  I use Boyle's Corned Beef.  After eating for supper and fixing leftovers for lunches for the next day never have anything left.  Everyone has seconds when this is served!!  Thanks Cindy!",

I had to do in a slow cooker while I was at work, but with a few changes, it still came out very good.  I put EVERYTHING your recipe called for (including some red potatoes)in a slow cooker and cooked for about 7 hours on high.  The meat was a little tough still so, I boiled on stove (about an hour) with meat and juices only, to finish. Great flavor and the potatoes and carrots (I used baby)were actually perfect (not too overcooked)The cabbage however was overcooked;which was okay because I only added half the called for amount(for the flavor).  I added the other half of fresh cabbage to the meat as I boiled the extra hour and it worked out fine. Thank you so much for the recipe!",
