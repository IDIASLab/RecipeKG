If you don't have any available press the next batch onto parchment paper and slide that onto the warm cookie sheet.

Unaltered this recipe may work best using a cookie press with a type of icing tip (instead of the design plates). To make this work with the cookie press design plates I added 2 1/4 cups flour. This made the consistency perfect but really weakened the flavor. So if adding more flour you may want to also add a little more sugar salt and extract. I've found that working flour into the dough with my hands is the best way to judge the consistency of the dough. Once my hand comes clean easily I've gotten a batter just stiff enough to keep shape. To get a finer almond grind use a mortar and pestle.",

Other reviewers were right in saying that this recipe is NOT a spritz recipe. The dough is way too sticky and will not hold it's shape once you run it through the cookie press. I added an extra 1 cup of flour allowed it to chill in the fridge for 8 hours and it still was difficult to press and completely lost its shape in the oven. I even tried rolling it out onto a floured surface and cutting with a cookie cutter... the dough just pulled apart and stuck to everything. BUT... all of that became no big deal once I tasted the finished cookie. DIVINE! They taste like no other and are absolutely amazing. I ended up using a spoon and dropped them onto a cookie sheet and baked as directed. I'm thinking about drizzling them with dark chocolate before serving them.",
