First. the only addition that I added to this cake was Lemon Pudding Mix in the Cake mix. There are many versions of this cake and this one I chose to make. IT WAS AWESOME! I thought I had died and gone to heaven. When I made the glaze for the top of the cake I was sure this cake was not going to work. But I was very wrong. This cake looks really sweet. But it truly is NOT. The glaze melts the brown sugar in the cake. I also poked holes in the cake before I spread the glaze on top of the still warm cake! I brought this to work the next day and they ate it up! I will make this recipe again. Just Great!",

They served it with the whipped topping and it seemed far too sweet (I have a sweet tooth) and it seemed to take away from the cake so I left that off. My husband is a chocolate cake man and loved the taste of this. I did not have any evaporated milk and had to make my own by reducing down a 1 1/4 cup of milk to a 1/2 cup and I guess that worked because the cake turned out great. I probably would not have tried this combination of ingredients had I not tried the finished product ahead of time. They make for a tasty moist rich cake. Thanks for sharing.",

This cake will be baked at my house many many more times!!! Thanks!!",

I wanted a bit more fruit so I added in a small can of drained pineapple as well as the fruit cocktail. Yum... Also... I increased the topping (Brown sugar & nut's) to 2/3 cup, each. ( It's dessert, RIGHT !!! ) This is a cake worth being called a dessert. Very refreshing from the chocolate and other 'regular' cakes.\nMake this cake and I Promise that you WILL be asked for this recipe. Also I have served this alone, with vanilla ice cream, (my favorite) as well as with more chilled fruit. Thanks for this recipe. I'm already passing it along... ",
