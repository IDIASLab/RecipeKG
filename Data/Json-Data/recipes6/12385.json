They all were able to roll these cookies after making the recipe with no modifications ... except for substituting water for coffee, just because they'd all say, \"Ewww!\" To make rolling easier, wash your hands every time the batter builds up on your fingers. I made them in January and had absolutely no problems with stickiness. I made the recipe with the coffee at home and it barely registered anyway. I have also done this adding a third of a cup of peanut butter and it is fabulous! The first time I used \"Old fashioned\" oats. It was fine, but the oats stick in your teeth. Now I only use 'Quick\" oats and the texture is much finer. The 5-star is from the Brownies. They loved it!",
