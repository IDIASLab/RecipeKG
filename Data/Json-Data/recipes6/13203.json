Though you can't really taste the pesto,  it really adds another layer flavor.  I did change a few things.   First, I browned and crumbled some sweet Italian sausage, then added some fresh mushrooms.  Once that was all cooked, I add two cans of plain spaghetti sauce and almost a whole container of pesto.  Once the pasta was cooked,  I threw it all in a casserole, topped with cheese and baked for 20 minutes or so.  My husband doesn't usually comment on pasta dishes - this one he did, repeatedly!",
