The differences, while minor, are worth noting in this old, classic recipe.  Add 1 tsp. baking flour to the flour/pudding mixture.  Use melted butter as it is easier to incorporate.  I use a 16 oz. can of sliced peaches, reserving 1/3 cup of the liquid.  I chop the peaches before sprinkling them atop the batter.  Add the 1/3 cup reserved peach liquid to the cream cheese.  Finally, I use an 8x8\u201d square pan and in so doing I find I need to bake this a little longer (directions say 45 minutes).  Fond memories on this one.",

I can't help but feel that this portion could be improved somehow.\n\nAlso, I think it is pointless to put packaged pudding mix in a from-scratch recipe.  What does this save me, 30 seconds of measuring out corn starch and vanilla extract?  The point of packaged mixes is the quick convenience of getting a finished product out of the box.  If you're using it as an ingredient in a from-scratch recipe, you might as well save money and just add 3 Tbsp corn starch, 1 Tbsp sugar,  1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of salt.  There, I just saved everyone who makes this a dollar or more.",
