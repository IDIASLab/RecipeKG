So I proofed my yeast in the bowl and added the oatmeal mixture ( which required over half an hour to cool enough to not kill the yeast ) Just reading the recipe I knew there was too much sugar for our tastes so I reduced that to 1/2 cup for half the recipe. After adding all the flour the dough was still far too wet and I lost track of how much more I had to add. The final result was worth it yielding 15 generous size rolls with just the right degree of sweetness.",
