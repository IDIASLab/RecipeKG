                "reviewBody": "this is wonderful and so simple. I made this as a Ramadan dessert treat for my DH and his friends. I upped the coconut by 1 tbsp. Decreased the sugar in the syrup by 1/4 cup and just boiled it a bit longer to get the right consistency for simple syrup. I had homemade rosewater my sister in law made and it is a bit stronger than store-bought. I still upped the rosewater by about 1tbsp. I just taste-tested the syrup after it was finished and adjusted accordingly. The flavor was not overpowering and was just perfect. Orange blossom water can also be substituted. You may see semolina flour packaged as \"cream of wheat\" in a Middle Eastern or Indian grocery; it is the same as semolina flour just a different name. Even though mine got a little too brown on top it did not affect the flavor. Next time I'll only do 1 minute under the broiler. As it cools it will absorb the simple syrup. These are also just as good served cold. Thanks so much for this wonderful simple recipe that will become a staple for my husband's sweet tooth!",

I'm not a big fan of rosewater so I used lemon juice. The other basboosa recipe on allrecipes uses lemon juice. I used Cream of Wheat because I couldn't find semolina flour and it worked. I broiled the cake for two minutes and it was overdone. Next time I'll reduce the time to one minute.",

I don't think that alone would have caused such a terrible outcome. First of all 20 minutes 3 minutes of broiling was far from enough time to cook this basboosa thoroughly. The top was browned very nicely so I added the syrup. When I cut out a square I realized the inside was raw and uncooked as ever. So I returned it to the oven for 22 more minutes (total 45 minutes)....still brown on the outside but raw on the inside.",
