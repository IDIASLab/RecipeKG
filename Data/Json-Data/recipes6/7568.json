And the cheese was a Mexican mix. As that it was amazing and delicious and will definitely do again. If I were making it from scratch I\u2019d have to do something to kick up the chicken a lot.

It came together rather quickly and I have to admit I was skeptical about layering the ingredients over the rice but it came out wonderfully.
