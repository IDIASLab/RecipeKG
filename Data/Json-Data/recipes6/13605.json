The only thing I changed was that I discarded the grape skins after removing the pulp. The grape flavor was superb hard to believe that it was so 'grape-y' just from the grapes almost as if someone infused concentrated grape extract into it. I guess that's the difference between Concordes and other grapes that distinct flavor. I suspect that this recipe would work well with other kinds of fruit especially peaches. Thanks!",

First I just used a regular food strainer to separate the pulp from the seeds and while I didn't get every drop of pulp I certainly got most of it. And yes the pie was a bit soupy when it first came out of the oven but after cooling overnight it thickened beautifully. I took the pie to work and it was a great hit. I will definitely be making this pie again.",

But after using three different types of strainers and squishing with a spoon and then frantically with my fingers I have learned for myself that grape pulp does NOT pass through a strainer. I was fishing the seeds out with my fingers until I gave up and called a neighbor to borrow her food mill. I still wound up with more juice than anything I could classify as \"pulp.\" If I had not added the skins back in I would have had nothing to make a pie WITH! I now have two messy gooey (yet tasty) pies that more closely resemble grape cobbler. This receipe gets a 3 for flavor ONLY. The effort required was not worth it and I will not make this again.",

The first one I used Concord grapes and I must say I had not problems at all with removing the seeds it was very easy actually and I followed the recipe exactly as well. If you boil the grapes long enough the seeds come right out. I used a potato masher to kind of help the grapes go through the strainer and I just used the kind of strainer that you would rinse noodles or fruit in because I didn't have anything else. Still no seeds went into the mixture so it worked for me. The second pie I used Niagra grapes and I cut the sugar in 1/2 but again no problems what so ever and I have never made a fruit pie like this. It tastes wonderful!!",
