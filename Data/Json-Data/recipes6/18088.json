Leave it overnight loosely covered with foil.  Must be completely cool before cutting otherwise you end up with odd shapes.  I used the straight edge of my cutting scraper to get even cuts (that you scoop cut veggies etc with).  The purpose of the potato starch is to keep the edges from sticking to everything.  Go EASY as it masks the flavor of the mochi.  I \"spank\" the excess off so they are very lightly covered.  I've baked in both types (metal and glass) and prefer the pyrex as the edges don't get as hard.  Plus the edges soften overnight and are fine to keep.  I added a picture to show how lightly to coat and how neatly the shape turns out when you wait for it to cool (on the yellow plate).  I also grew up in Hawaii and found this to beat out all my Hawaiian recipe books.  Thanks for the post Dewny!",

(About a dozen 1.5 inch pieces will sell for $5!)  So I decided to find a recipe and make it myself.  I've made it three times within a week and each time it has come out perfectly.  \n\nI will share some lessons.  For some reason, some stores only have 13.5 oz (not the 14 oz in the recipe) cans of  coconut milk.  It was not a problem.  Also, if you let your kids help you with the potato starch dusting, make sure they go easy.  To them it looks like powdered sugar so they think, the more the better.  I ended up individually dusting off the excess from each piece.  I agree with the previous reviewer to make sure the pan is completely cool before removing so that it keeps its shape.  Lastly, trim and discard the hard edges.  (The sides get crisp as it is against the pan.)  \nI shared the results with many different people and they all said it was the best they ever had.  Thank you Dewny!",

And all turned out fabulous.   It's so easy to make, too! I just dump everything to food processor and process it for a 10 or 15 seconds before pouring it into the lightly greased pan. Fool proof.  Also try substitute half coconut milk with non dairy whipping cream and you will never look back.   Some tips: a) I bake mine in water bath, bottom rack, for about 1 hour to avoid the crusty edge problem. b) Let it cool down completely at least two hours, overnight better, before flipping it out of the pan. c) Use lightly greased plastic cake knife for easier cutting. d) For safer option, toast the coating starch without oil for few minutes and cool it down completely before using. e) For the neat coating, put coated mochi in a big strainer and shake the excessive starch off.   Excellent recipe! The only bad thing about this mochi is that I can't stop eating them!!  Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Dewny!",

Just be patient and let it cool completely. Best is to make it a day ahead and let it cool overnight, then cut in pieces the following morning. Much easier to handle and slice. Also used the trick of wrapping a plastic knife in saran wrap. I never used that method before and it made the cutting soooo easy! I used potato starch to coat. Wonderful - just like the old japanese grandmas used to make for me back home. Followed the recipe to the \"T\". Can't go wrong. ",

It seems a bit over cooked and doesn't have the texture that store bought mochi has. the bottom and sides have all crusted slightly. I might give this another go but cutting some of the bake time in the recipe.",
