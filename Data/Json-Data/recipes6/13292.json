I bake apple pie's for the holidays every year, and they all turn out great. This past holiday, I decided to try something different, and I was sorry I did. It was wayyyy too tart, soggy, and not at all what I expected.  I was EMBARRASSED because I brought this one to my future in-laws, and they were polite but I could tell it wasn't the best pie they ever had. I sometimes read these reviews and when I read a negative review I think, \"Aw, that person just doesn't know how to cook!\" But I've been baking for YEARS, and I LOVE to bake, and my family looks forward to my pies every holiday, but this one- never again!\r\n",

My non-apple- pie-eater couldn't resist and really enjoyed this! I added a little bit more flour in with the sugar/cinnamon mixture as well as a little bit of ground tapioca. I also brushed egg on the crust first just to be on the safe side.:o) I wasn't sure how the topping would turn out as it just didn't seem right. I added a tblspn more each of sugar and flour. Maybe it was because my butter was cold. I don't know but it turned out great!",

I used white parchement from wilson's which has a heat of 400 max... so I lowered the temp and baked it 10 mins more.. with a cookie sheet that was bigger than the pie dish and the paper did not touch the rack or sides etc.. I think that in the receipe for people who do not register to see the ratings you should tell them that there is possiblity of fire... at the high temp... you can cook a pie at a lower temp just have to cook it longer... this is a safety factor that should be addressed.",

Nonetheless, it still was a wonderful pie.  I used white parchment paper, folded seams, and stapled the seams.  I made sure all the staples were accounted for when the pie came out of the paper!!  My husband and 4.5 year old just loved it.  Easy to make (as far as apple pies go).  I'm going to try something similar with blueberries.  (Oh, I baked it in the middle of the oven on top of a cookie sheet.  The parchment paper caught the spills, so cleaning the cookie sheet was a breeze.)  Thumbs up!!!",
