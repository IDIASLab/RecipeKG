What a great combination of ingredients that resulted in a uniquely flavored dish and the visual appeal was second to none. My friends just raved about it and it literally was all gone in a number of minutes. Thanks for the great dish. P.S. I am preparing it again today for a Pittsburgh Steeler party at a friends.",
