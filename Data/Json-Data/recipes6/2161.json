I didn't have the serrano pepper but the cayenne gives it a nice kick. I used frozen tri-color peppers and two frozen garlic cubes. I didn't use the tomato sauce but there was sufficient liquid. I just let it simmer for a shorter amount of time 10 min. I gave a few squeezes from a tube of refrigerated cilantro adding with the tomatoes. I had this as a one-dish supper topping with a Mexican blend shredded cheese and microwaved for about 15 sec. Served with a few round tortilla chips. This could be served over rice in a burrito taco etc but having it by itself was just fine! Thanks for the great recipe!",
