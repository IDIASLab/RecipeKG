I did reduce the sugar by half and it was exactly the right amount lending a taste of sweetness but not so sweet that it tasted like desert. The burgundy provided a twist which is hard to describe but welcome nonetheless. It did not leave any sort of liquory flavor and did not overwhelm. Highly recommended. Authentically Italian.",

I had leftover burger patties I put them in a bun with cheese and then the sauce in between and on top of the bun with a little bit of grated cheese.  They were good.",

I wasn't sure what \"beef sausage\" was being an experienced cook. However I used 1/2 lb of sausage and 1/2 lb of beef and it still tastes very good. I skipped the step of cooking the onion and mushrooms in olive oil and just cooked them with the beef/sausage. I used shiraz wine as many others suggested. I can definitely taste the uniqueness of the wine in the sauce. Thanks for this great recipe - its one I'm sure I will use again! Oh one other thing - it is a sweet sauce. I like the sweet but if you don't like sweet spaghetti sauce you might want to cut down on the sugar a bit.",
