The directions do not tell you to put the beaten egg whites into the pie plate and to \"mold\" the eggwhite edges upwards to hold in the filling after the shell is baked. I have made a similar pie before so I knew to do this. I did not use a bouble bolier as the instructions said but just cooked the egg yolk mixture over medium low heat until it was thick and began to boil. Be sure to cool both the shell and the lemon mixture completely as the instructions tell you. I used two cups of whipped cream and added a little vanilla and powdered sugar to the whipped cream for a hint of sweetening. I garnished the top with a few fresh red raspberries on each piece. I will definately make this recipe again as it is a real winner. I served this for company and everyone loved it!",

Not only does this lighten it up, it also gives the base a velvety feel to the tongue. Garnish with lemon rind curls & you've got a winner.",

No need to use a double boiler--just cook the lemon juice sugar (reduced to 1/3 cup) and egg yolk over medium low heat whisking constantly until thick. When the lemon curd has completely cooled fold in 2 stiffly beaten egg whites and 1 (8 oz) container Cool Whip. Pour into meringue shell and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Then top it with real whipped cream and garnish with lemon peel. This is a great Spring/Summer pie! P.S. Always use a glass pie plate and spray it well with cooking spray before putting in the meringue. This will make serving the pie much easier.",

Baked meringue is very fragile and I had a heck of a time getting a slice out in one piece. So for presentation unless you're a whiz at cutting meringe I'd only give it a 3 but the taste is definitely 5-star. The lemon is delightfully tart and is balanced by the sweetness of the meringue crust. I see no need to sweeten the whipped cream as it seems the dessert is sweet enough without it. I was concerned about the relatively small amount of lemon curd compared to the other ingredients but the intense flavor carries through even though the amount is small. This is a wonderful alternative to lemon meringue pie. 4/12/09--I shaped individual crusts on parchment on a cookie sheet. This worked well and I didn't have the mess trying to cut it that I had when it was a whole pie.",

When I make this again (probably today) I will try piping the whipped cream topping to make it prettier. This deserves a place of honour in your recipe box.

It is important to mold the egg whites so that the sides are thick and high. If you leave the bottom thick it will stay more on the foamy side and not crisp/harden up like the sides do. I do not like to layer the whipped cream and the lemon curd rather I fold the lemon curd into the whipped cream. I keep some of the whipped cream on the side because that way I can control the tanginess of the filling better. I prefer the filling to be more tangy than perhaps the recipe may portions show so I fold half the whipped cream into the lemon curd and add the more whipping cream to my taste. It is beautiful garnished with thin lemon slices coated with sugar crystals. I give this recipe a 5",
