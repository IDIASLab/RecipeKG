                "reviewBody": "I think the serving size listed for this recipe is incorrect.  It says: serves 6.  Two pounds of spinach is a huge amount, even as the main meal, this would probably feed more.  \r\n\r\nAssuming you're serving it as a side salad, this recipe (using 2 lbs of spinach) should feed about 24 people.  \r\n\r\nI scaled this recipe back to get the correct amount needed for 6 people (I would allow one egg per person though).  It worked great.  I would strongly suggest that you make your own croutons using the GARLIC CROUTON recipe submitted by Cathy Hofmann.  It's wonderful!!\r\nTime saving tips: 1. don't use a blender, put everything into a wide mouth bottle (like a 16 oz Gatorade bottle) and shake it up.  No blender to clean and you can toss the bottle! \r\n2. use REAL bacon already cooked and crumbled at the store.",
