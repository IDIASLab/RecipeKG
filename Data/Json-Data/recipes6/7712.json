And I would use the diced shredded in the future.  The topping was crispy, the casserole consistency is good, timing was spot on, but the flavor is a bit bland.  It definitely needs some seasoning, and I just might try Pepper Jack cheese next time which should elevate the flavor.  Easy to prepare, few ingredients, and it will feed a crowd!",
