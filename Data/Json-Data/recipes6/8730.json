Dill has little or no flavor after being cooked for that long a period of time and especially so when using dried dill. I suggest using two or three pinches of chopped fresh dill weed instead. Also a word of caution about placing a baking dish under a broiler and especially if it's Pyrex brand because they often cannot withstand that high of heat and will shatter even if it had already been at oven temperatures. I learned that first hand and felt like a fool when reading the bottom of my other Pyrex baking dish afterwards; \"No Stove Top - No Broiler\". It took not only losing a baking dish but also all the yummy food that was in it:-( I am adding an answer to RckyMtnGirl's question of how someone could have originally rated this recipe on March 3rd but she didn't see the recipe posted until March 6th. Well it was originally posted early Saturday morning of the 3rd and I tried it that afternoon;-)",

So good that I am making it again tonight and will add afew scallops to try.\nThank you for sharing your friend's recipe.\nI am sorry for your loss and will always make this in her honor.\nHere's to Chele!",
