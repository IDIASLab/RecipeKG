I did make two small changes based off of what I had on hand. I used russet potatoes instead of yukon and frozen peas instead of frozen corn. Peas work great too so when I make this again I'll use 1 cup of peas and 1 cup of corn for an even more colorful bowl. Thanks for the super simple flavorful soup!",
