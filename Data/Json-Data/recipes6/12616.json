Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips I used 1 cup of chocolate chips plus 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of coconut. For the frosting I used the following recipe: Combine 1 egg (lightly beaten), 1- 5 ounce can of evaporated milk, 2/3 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan. Cook and stir 10-12 minutes over medium-low heat until slightly thickened(don't turn the heat up too high or you could end up with some sweet scrambled eggs). Stir in 1 1/3 cup of coconut and at least 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. After the cookies are done I drizzle them with chocolate (chocolate chips in a Ziploc bag microwaved 20 seconds at a time until melted). Delicious and pretty!",
