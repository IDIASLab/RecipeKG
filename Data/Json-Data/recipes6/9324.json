This recipe calls for kosher salt and due to it's crystalline structure calls for a greater volume as opposed to finer sea salt. Even different brands of kosher salt vary. Diamond Crystal is what most seasoned chefs prefer and so 3 tablespoons is appropriate for this recipe. If using fine salt you should use 1/3 the amount but it's harder for dry rubs. Fine salt is for boiling applications. Never use iodinized salt either as it makes foods taste metallic.",

You mix the ingredients together to blend and then add them into the salt shaker.  You shake the shaker into the steaks and then follow the directions.  It also says kosher salt NOT table salt.  I think the problem some of the people thought that the 3 tablespoons of salt were actually being put on those poor innocent steaks.  Yes folks, 3 tablespoons of salt will kill you if it is being put on one or two or four steaks.  It is meant for many, many times of use.  So if you want to eliminate some of the salt, so do it.  This rub is meant to be used many times, not won time.  Good blend of spices compliment the steak..",
