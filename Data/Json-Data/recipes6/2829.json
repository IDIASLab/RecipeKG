I don't know if it was that all the flavors didn't mesh - because the ingredients are fantastic - but it tasted awful. I followed the recipe to a T with one small exception - i used chardonnay vinegar because i only had sherry wine (and the wine is not a sub for vinegar), but I can't imagine the chardonnay vinegar would've altered the flavor of the marinade that much because of how much hoisin it calls for. I'm a huge fan of Chef John's recipes but this marinade just didn't cut it for me and was a no go for my family as well.",
