It actually got me so curious I just had to try it. I followed the recipe for both the biscuits and the gravy to the letter. Measured everything (which I rarely do anymore). I must say this turned out to be exactly like so concoction my mother would have made when I was a kid. What is the point of the poultry seasoning? What is poultry seasoning? And the nutmeg! Why am I putting \"Nutmeg\" in my sausage gravy? Let's not forget the biscuits or were they rolls? If you simply get rid of the yeast and butter your looking at buttermilk biscuits that take about five minutes prep time and 10 minutes in the oven. I don't want to wait 2 1/2 hours for my B&G in the morning! If you really want a decent gravy in the morning try \"Bob Evans Sausage Gravy\" on this site. It has great reviews and too simple to make.",

I realize that it does come out a bit thick but I add milk as needed to make it come out just right. The \"unusual\" spices give it a nice twist on something that normally is a bit on the bland side. UPDATE....8/12/2011 although I have for the most part memorized this recipe(Thanks again for submitting Debbie!!) I just can't help but comment on some of the really nasty comments left here. There are plenty of pre-mixed packages of garbage that you simply add water to or if feeling a little daring substitute milk. This recipe can take many different directions that's the beauty of it and for people who are not family with poultry seasoning maybe they should become a little more educated in the kitchen before writing such a nasty review.",

Increase the flour; I use 4 1/2 tbsp and then use 4 1/2 cups milk. But always use the same ratio of flour to milk. I use 1 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning since I increased the liquid. Nutmeg is optional.
