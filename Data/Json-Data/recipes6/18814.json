Well since I'm lazy I decided to make Apple Charlotte because it was mentioned in the book. There are 18 people in my class and no one ate the bread. They smothered the apples with whipped cream and I would be surprised if they could taste the apples. The bread wasn't mushy but the outside was toasted and the inside was flabby. My teacher liked it becaused he said it wasnt too sweet like normal pies. I would suggest using ladyfingers in lieu of bread and maybe a different filling like cherries or strawberries because they produce more sugary juices when being cooked.",

Because the previous reviewer said this was mushy I adjusted the size of the pan. I used a 9x13\" glass pan. This required using an extra half loaf of bread. My family said this tasted like slightly toasted bread with cooked apples. They felt it was way too much bread and way too little apple flavor. I imagine there may be other ways to adjust this recipe to make it better but I'm not game for wasting more bread on it. Sorry I can't recommend this one.",

                "reviewBody": "This royal time-honored recipe (hello -- Downton Abbey -- Mrs. Patmore's near-disaster!) turned out beautifully with the following changes: I melted a stick of butter then brushed it onto about 8 stale hamburger buns (split of course). Then I peeled and quartered 5 granny smith apples then rinsed them and put them into a saucepan with 2T caster sugar and 2T butter over low heat. After about 30 mins of stirring occasionally they became pulpy (next time I'm going to try out-and-out caramelizing them!) so I put them in a bowl and mashed them up. I then added another T butter 3T sugar and 1/4C cream cheese and about 2t each ginger cinnamon nutmeg allspice and pumpkin pie spice. This was not too much spice considering all that bread! Then I buttered an 8in. round casserole and pressed one layer of stale buns on the bottom VERY hard then added half the apple puree then another layer of buns pressing very hard then the rest of the apples then a final layer of buns. I put it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 mins or until the top buns were VERY dark. Then I turned it upside down on a plate and gave it about 10 mins before we dove in. My brother agreed -- heavenly!!! And it held it's shape very well even the next day cut like a pie! Not at all runny! A definite hit a unique mix between a cake and a pie! Next time I might experiment with a different stewed fruit or maybe a custard. Served with ice cream -- the BOMB!!!",
