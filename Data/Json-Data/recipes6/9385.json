The fresher it is, the better this works, so I do this as soon as I get home from the store (also makes weeknight cooking quicker & easier when I am ready to make).  I also like to line the baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up.  Instead of tossing with olive oil I spray with cooking spray after the asparagus is spread in an even layer on the sheet.  I promise it tastes just as good.  Then I sprinkle with coarse salt & fine pepper (sprinkle from up high to more evenly distribute the seasonings).",
