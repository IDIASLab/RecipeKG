I really like my recipe better wich is basically changing the flour to 1 cup and take away an egg or two depending on size. I also usually substitute 1/3 of the flour to whole wheat flour. We also usually eat our pancakes with strawberry jam or other kind of jam. I make them in a 10 inch pan with low edges with a long spatula I bought at IKEA. Just use your wrist to turn the pan to spread the batter out. If it gets stuck just use som butter on the pan. This recipe can also be used as an oven pancake if you add some fried bacon pieces in an 9x13 bakingpan and bake in the oven at 450 for 25-30 min and serve with lingonberries.",

I think the recipe my great-grandmother brought from Sweden was something like: a bunch of eggs, then flour until it's thick, then milk until it's thin.  Not being the greatest cook, I need a more detailed recipe to follow.  This one definitely works.  \r\nA helpful hint I learned from watching my mother make them: use a medium sized frying pan, when it's hot, hold it in your hand, pour a small amount of batter into the middle of the pan then use your wrist to turn the pan and swirl the batter around to make an even layer in the pan.  You don't need to use much batter--these pancakes are supposed to be very thin.",

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very yummy and how I remember them to be.  Still looking for the secret ingredient to make them as magical as the Stockholm Inn's.",

I expected the batter to be runny having made crepes many times over the years. My only concern was the butter that then congealed a bit in the metal bowl so I gently heated it on a burner and stirred with a wisk. You have to be patient with this recipe and not try to mess with the edges of the pancake until they begin to pull away from the pan or until the very edge begins to brown a bit. I had my pan on a bit high so they didn't quite look like the IHOP ones I love but they tasted awesome! I was able to work a silicone spatula under them to the middle and flip them without cutting. When done I folded them in quarter and put them on a plate in a 170 degree oven until I got all of them made. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and heated apricot jam. Do I plan on keeping this recipe? Heck yes! I'm going to try it next time with vanilla or maybe try the OJ suggestion too for a change. However the recipe is really great as is. The right tools will help keep the frustration at a minimum.",
