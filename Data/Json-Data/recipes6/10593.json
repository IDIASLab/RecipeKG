In fact it's about as close as I can get to the dresdener stollen I buy from Germany! It does appear too dry when mixing at first but I mixed it in a kitchen aid with the bread attachment and once I poured in the fruit/nut mixture with the excess rum it did what all of my other bread does balls up around the bread attachment and kneads itself against the bowl. I hand kneaded for about 5 minutes followed the rest of the instructions and I couldn't be happier with the result. Now with the yeast I mix it all up with a chop stick and put the bowl by my wood burning stove until very very frothy but I do that with all breads. The key is this is not a cake it is a bread and must be treated like it. Hats off to this stollen. Best I've ever made!!!",
