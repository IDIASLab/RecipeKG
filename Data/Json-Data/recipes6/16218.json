If made properly this cake will be moist but it is important that the batter is beat for the full 4 minutes that the recipe calls for in order to activate the pudding in the cake mix. Since there are no liquids added to the cake mix other than the oil the batter will be thick. I bake my cake for the full 75 minutes at 325 as directed on the recipe and it comes out just right every time but not all ovens are the same. The only thing I have changed on this recipe is to toast the almonds. If you like coconut this is an exceptionally good and easy recipe. Thanks Jennifer for a great recipe!",

I used 1 teaspoon of coconut extract low fat sour cream and used a whipped cream frosting and browned some coconut flakes to put on top. I also cut the sugar down a bit and made them into 24 muffins. Everybody loved it! Very moist! This went perfect for my Hawaiian themed birthday party.",
