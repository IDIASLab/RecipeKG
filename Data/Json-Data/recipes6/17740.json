This recipe is so close that I'm calling it a match. I can't tell my co-worker...I'm afraid I could end up with concrete shoes in the bottom of the river! The dough is very soft so I set it in the fridge for 30 minutes and used a Pampered Chef small scoop to form the cookies (approx 1 tablespoon), then placed on parchment paper. They did not spread much so 2 inches apart is more than sufficient. These cookies are not golden (until you lift them off the pan). They are done when they don't look wet/shiny. Make sure to allow the cookies to rest for 5 minutes before removing them from the pan. You won't be disappointed! I ended up with just over 50 small rounded cookies.",

I agree with a previous reviewer that you really have to check these because you don't want to overbake them.  They don't look done at 8 or 9 minutes, but they probably are.  Check the bottoms to make sure they're a light golden brown color.  Thank you, Pam for this recipe.",

We used to order yummy tiramisu cupcakes but our baker retired...so we searched at the last minute for a little sweet morsel to serve and these cookies were perfect! I changed the servings to 96 and we made up a great batch for a crowd (we made them a bit smaller to stretch it a bit). I did add a bit of lemon zest which added some nice flavor. Tonight I'm going to make them again (not 96 of them though!) and I'll add a dash of limoncello. Delizioso!",
