Reading the other reviews , I made the following suggested modifications:  used deep dish pie crust, the amount of filling turned out just right that way; cut down bourbon to 2 tbs and sugar to 3/4 cup; and laid down a single layer of chocolate chips at the bottom of the crust (did not measure, it was maybe 2 oz of chips) instead of mixing them in the filling.  This was the first pecan pie I ever made, and I make desserts rarely, but this was easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  If you want a nice pecan pie with a twist (that is not overpowering), try this one.",
