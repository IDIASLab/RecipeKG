In the past the shrimp or whatever I fried would comes out of the fryer nice and fluffy but by the time the entire batch was done it would get soggy. Not with this one! The original that were pulled out of the fryer were just as crispy as the last batch out of the fryer. This will definitely be my go to for tempura batter. The dipping sauce was good too. A little on the salty side but still good. I made one change and that is that I used green onions instead of shallots and green onions work just fine too. Thanks for sharing Marcy!",
