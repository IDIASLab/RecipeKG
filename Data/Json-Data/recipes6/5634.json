I did not have shallots or red onion, but yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic tasted fine to me.  No corn oil either, so I used extra virgin olive oil.  I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth.  No frozen corn on hand, so I used 2 cans of the green giant super sweet niblets, drained.  I still reserved one cup, but pureed the rest, which was about 6 oz more corn than the recipe called for.  But really, what can more corn hurt?  :)  Right before serving I put in somewhere between 3/4 and 1 cup of heavy cream.  Not exactly sure as it was whatever was left in the container and I didn't think to measure before I dumped it in.  It was good before I did that, it was over the top after the cream!  I was wishing I had some shrimp to throw in there too, but not this time.  Oh, and I just realized I didn't put in the parsley!!!  Oh well!!\n\nDefinitely a keeper and good enough for company.  One suggestion is to roast 3 sweet potatoes, because they were good enough to eat like candy so not all of them made it into the soup.  Oops!",

I used about 1.5 sweet potatoes (mine were huge!) and they took about 30 min to roast but next time I will probably chop them into smaller cubes which should reduce the cook time.

I agree with the other reviewers who said that something was missing... I might try to take what's left and add a lot more stock and maybe some other veg in effort to cut the sweetness down. UPDATE: I made the recipe to a 'T' and wasn't happy with the results so the next night I browned some fresh good-quality chorizo (from pork shoulder) then added two cups chicken stock crushed red chili flakes chopped cilantro and the juice of 1/2 a lime. I simmered that for about 30 minutes. I then added the remainder of the original soup to my new mixture. The result was fabulous we all agreed and I would make the second version again. I understand however that this is nothing close to the original recipe!",

It wasn't even like a stew it was more like a hash. It tasted pretty good (I agree w/ the first review that it was missing something couldn't figure out what) but it just tasted like a bowl of potato and corn hash browns to us. I will probably play around with the recipe adding more broth perhaps creamed corn instead of frozen and maybe some half and half. Thanks for the great idea but we didn't love it.",
