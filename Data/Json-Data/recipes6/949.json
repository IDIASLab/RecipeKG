I've never had these before - really impressed with the flavor and so dang simple.  We made them tonight as a snack - just to test the booze dogs out.  Oh snap! So good, my husband is polishing them off as I type this review - thanks so much. Cooked a little longer (as recommended by another review) - delicious.  I'm sure this will be a hit this holiday weekend!",

This works best with less dense hot dogs like turkey it holds the flavor better and once the dogs \"puff\" and deflate while cooking the texture will be perfect and the flavor will be infused.
