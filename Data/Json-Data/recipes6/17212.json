These waffles were SO different I knew I had to try them. I actually used semi sweet mini chocolate chips b/c they would melt quicker. I didn't make any changes to the recipe - but please note they will NOT get crisp from the waffle iron but once they are plated they will. This recipe has great potential if you're the type to play w/ recipes;) A quick swap to white chocolate chips and some fresh raspberries or if you want 60% cacao chips and mandarin oranges - the combinations are endless:) Thanks to allrecipes for correcting the info;)",
