It has become a much anticipated family custom. It's best to make your own pie shell instead of using the ready made kind because they aren't deep enough. This recipe is easily doubled.",

I will also use all brown sugar to bring out the spices. I found it was (too?) sweet but needed more spice to give it that pumpkin pie warmth we expect from a pie.",
