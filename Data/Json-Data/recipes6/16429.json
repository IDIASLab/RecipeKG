It really does have the taste and feel of a croissant though so that satisfies me! I only baked 8 croissants and am freezing the rest so I can have them freshly baked when I feel like it. Just freeze them in their croissant shape and then on the day you want to bake them take them out a couple of hours ahead of time to thaw and rise. Also beat 1 Tbsp of water with the egg before brushing it on... it makes a better glaze.",
