I can't believe that to date I am only the third person reviewing this and the first since 2006! Hubby had been requesting \"something like a chocolate chip cookie but with chocolate covered raisins too and something a little different.\" When I came up with this for him he with a mouthful of cookie signaled his approval with an \"m-mmmm\" and two thumbs up. He said it was everything he had imagined only better! The Rice Krispies provide an interesting and unexpected texture and the exclusion of brown sugar was a nice change. I prepared the recipe as written only using chocolate covered raisins as hubs requested. You could certainly use half brown sugar and half white for a more golden cookie with a hint of butterscotch flavor but these are great just as is.",
