I used a few variations: add some spice with dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg; use dark chocolate chips for more intensity; and coffee liquore instead of bourbon.  I know these variations may make it less \"traditional\" but this recipe overall is a genuine 1st Place Winner.  Thanks, Judi!",

The only ingredient alteration I make is adding a little extra bourbon and vanilla. After everyone loved the pie, I made these in bar form for a picnic: they turned out GREAT!  For a 9x9 pan, I used 1.5 times the recipe.  One circular pie crust still covers the bottom of the pan - I cut off the excess crust about 1/4\" up the sides. Baked for 30-35 minutes. COOL COMPLETELY before you cut them into squares.  Next time, I'll double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan.",
