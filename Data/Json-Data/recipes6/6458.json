They came out great except that I had a hard time getting the sauce to stick to the wings. I found the best way to do this was cook them as instructed in the Instant Pot, then coat them in the sauce, broil them for five minutes, coat them again, and broil them for three minutes. This gives the wings a saucier flavor and allows for easy dipping as they are no longer \"wet.\" All in all, these turned out great and were a big hit!",
