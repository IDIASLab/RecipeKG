Instead of any instant I used real Turkish coffee which is ground to the finest grind possible even finer than espresso! The coffee has about 10% cardamom powder added so it is strongly flavored with it. (Some Turkish coffees have clove added instead or no spice.) I basically made a Turkish coffee by simmering 3 Tblsp. of fine grinds in only 3/4 cup water with the sugar. The amounts of cream & sugar remained the same but no more water was added the milk was increased to 2-1/4 cups & the yolks reduced to 4. I know! I've changed the original recipe enough & made my own but it all started with this recipe. Thanks Marilyn Perzik! I highly recommend this unusual ice cream!",

Next time I will use less heavy cream as it does tend to coat the spoon and roof of your mouth. Not sure what the person did who said it tasted like ice... but mine was great! The ice cream was a little soft so I'll try using a little less sugar as I've been told the sugar will soften the ice cream. It is plenty sweet so using less sugar will not adversely affect the taste.",
