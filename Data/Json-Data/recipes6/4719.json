My husband loves this soup so much he planted kohlrabi in our garden; it looks like a small green turnip. The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter. Serve with your favorite bread.",

I used 1 cup of skim milk powder to 2 and 1/2 cups of water instead of milk (didn't have any reg. milk). Skipped the orzo (didn't have that either) but we truly didn't miss it.",
