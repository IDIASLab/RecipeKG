My portion didn't even fill up my small glass halfway, and that's after I doubled the water because as written there wasn't nearly enough liquid to get this to blend. I ended up pouring it into a mini mason jar (jelly jar size) to get it presentable for a photo, and it didn't even fill that up.  I also thought it was a little heavy on the green tea/matcha, so you might want to back that down to 2 tsp. Other than that, the flavor was really good, and I really enjoyed the green tea/blackberry combo.",
