My minor changes were that I cooked at 350F for a total of an hour and ten minutes, didn't add the butter and I did not wrap the ears in foil.  The bacon I used was extremely thin, and very fatty.  The corn was not overdone, was plenty tasty with just the rendered bacon fat, and the bacon was truly super delicious!  This was easy, and I don't think I can have out-of-season corn any other way from now on.",

After 45 minutes my corn was getting to the point of being overdone and as you can see from the picture my bacon was not near done enough. I really liked the flavor combo and I think this recipe has potential however wrapped up in foil the bacon never will crisp up. I plan on experimenting with this again. Next time I will pre-cook my bacon some pin it onto the corn with toothpicks and then grill it over open flame instead of in the foil.",
