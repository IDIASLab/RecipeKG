Used a touch more corn starch to compensate. I too used store-bought frozen meatballs (Swedish -as they have the least overpowering flavours vs. Italian style for example. Made if for High school boys hockey team Thanksgiving dinner as a meat side dish. Son says will be well received! Edit: nov 28th cooked these in dutch oven on stovetop. Kept near frozen over 2 nites. Reheated today (stovetop same dutch oven they were still in) to transport to dinner location and then ladled into preheated CrockPot. As one reviewer said they taste better the next day (less catsup-y). Will definitely reuse this easy recipe!",
