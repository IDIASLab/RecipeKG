Strayed from my usual grocery list to acquire Gorgonzola cheese & arborio rice but it was worth it to create this risotto dish! (BTW Thanks for the additional tip regarding the USA & Italy versions of Gorgonzola being very different products). We opted to throw the radicchio in early so it would have extra time to cook down just in case we d find the taste too bitter. But next time I probably will try following the recipe exactly to see if we like the radicchio taste standing out a bit more. The balsamic glaze really is a must. Thank you!",

If using the dry variety often found in America you may need less than written. Also if you prefer the radicchio to be a bit more tender saut\u00e9 it with the vegetables at the beginning.",
