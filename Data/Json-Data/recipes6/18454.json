I also used whipping cream instead of powdered milk and water, and increased the vanilla 3 fold...which gave the cake a great flavor. I was so impressed with the ease of making this, and how few ingredients and items on hand are in pantry. My husband and I ate the whole thing. I also used a rectagular glass pan which worked well. I baked mine for 40 minutes. I also had one small peach which I added to the apricots, added 3 times the sugar with cinnamon, and it was so good. DEFINITELY a coffee cake for company!",

I also spread half the batter in the pan, then topped the half with a mixture of cinnamon sugar, added the other half of the batter and proceeded with the directions for the topping. Baking took exactly 45 minutes, and when the cake had  cooled slightly, I added a powdered sugar and milk icing. Tangy and sweet, this coffee cake really wakes up your taste buds! I will definitely make this again. Fresh apricots are difficult to find here, but I am sure that well-drained, canned apricots could be used.",
