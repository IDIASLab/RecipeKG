Either way, we really love these. I did a few things different. I replaced over half of the butter with applesauce and I used brown sugar as well as white and added in some walnuts for crunch. I think the applesauce, oatmeal, and bananas makes it a good cookie to give children. It's a little healthier than your normal chocolate chip cookie! Thanks Jenny!",
