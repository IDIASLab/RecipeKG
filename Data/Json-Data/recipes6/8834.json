After sauteing the onions and garlic, there is no butter left in the pan to whisk the flour into. You will definitely need to add more. I also think you should take advantage of the pan juices from the pork chops to make the gravy because...hey, more flavor! If I were to make this again, I'd saute the onions, garlic and mushrooms in a pan, then place them in a bowl. I'd then saute the pork chops in the same pan until browned on both sides, then remove to a plate. I'd then scrape up the browned bits in the pan, with a little added fat and the flour to make the roux, add in the broth to make the gravy, then add everything back into the pan and simmer.",

I didn\u2019t have a large enough pan so I juggled 3 pans !\nI added allot more seasoning and 3 onions and much more garlic.\nI don\u2019t do well following recipes so I was praying for guidance!

Many were helpful (France C in particular, but I'd reverse her suggested order next time, Pork chops 1st, onions, garlic - & mushrooms- why not saute them? next then the gravy & simmer.) Also, you shouldn't need more that a T of butter for the pork chops, maybe as much as 2T for the veggies (but you can never have too much butter), then when it comes to the gravy, use your judgment, the fat has to match the flour to get a smooth roux. Also the comments on lack of flavor were dead on, but they could not have tasted the gravy before starting the simmer, it was too obvious! It will take a LOT more salt & pepper, and I even added some Worcestershire sauce & beef bullion cubes to my (superb!) homemade chicken stock.\n\nGiven these adjustments, I served with rice & green beans. The gravy & rice was the best part of the meal, we all agreed.",

The sauce is very creamy and thick, the chops were very moist and tasty, and you have room to play around if you want more or less of the onion or garlic.  I did not use the mushrooms because I can't stand them but this didn't need them at all.  It is simple to make and, to save pans, I fried the chops ahead of time, then made the gravy in a skillet later and added the colder chops to it.  1 skillet, no fuss.  Using coarse ground black pepper gave it an extra mild kick.  As mentioned in the recipe, it is best to use thinner chops and keep all of them the same size to ensure even cooking.  Loved it and will make it again and again!",
