Plus, it made the muffin more appealing to my picky 3 year old, who might have been discouraged by the carrot chunks! 2 cups= +/- 3 medium carrots\n\nUPDATE- For those doing WW, this is 10 points each if you make 12 muffins and copy the recipe word for word. If you omit the walnuts (10.5 points) and use 1 cup of applesauce (2 points) instead of 1 cup of oil (57 points!!!) that will bring each muffin to 4 points, and it's still just as delicious. I love grabbing one of these for a healthy breakfast just before running out the door. :)",

Using the review advice, I substituted half a cup of applesauce for the oil, which worked great.  A word of warning though if opting not to use the oil; do not sure paper muffin pan liners, as they will stick to the muffins.  Also cut sugar in half, and it wasn't missed.  I got creative with add ins, adding in some dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  These were amazing! Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!",

However I think I may have forgotten the salt -but??... can that be it??? Actually I followed the recipe and I'm a pretty good cook....so why?..even have fresh baking soda.. and they sound SO good! Since I have to rate let it reflect my attempt not the recipe. I'm a pretty good cook w/lots of experience...and actually followed the recipe-(my baking soda is new ) the one thing I did screw up on was the salt I forgot to add (I think)",
