I used a fresh jalapeno removing the seeds which didn't provide enough zing to the dressing. Next time will use the prepared jalapeno and maybe add some cumin or cilantro to pep up the dressing. I used white vinegar which was a little strong for my taste. I will either cut down on the amount or use rice vinegar for a lighter taste. Also needed some crunch so chopped bell pepper or even celery would be a good addition. And cheese is kind of unnecessary added calories but not much taste...",
