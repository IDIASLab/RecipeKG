I was looking for something that used no eggs nor oil, and I found this one.  I was a bit skeptical but decided to try it anyway and it came out of the oven about 20 minutes ago.  YUM!!  My 7 year old (mr. picky)is eating some now.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to the reviewer that had a bad experience with it, to try again.

I used butter not margarine, and baked it for 45 minutes.  I thought the batter was very stiff and was a little worried, but it came out perfect.  I used the ingredients exactly as listed.  I dusted it with powdered sugar when it was still slightly warm and served it.  They all loved it including the grandchildren.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'll use it many times I am sure.",

I used whipped cream cheese frosting fromthis site on it. perfect combo. Try this you will love it!",
