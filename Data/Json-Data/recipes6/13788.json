Altered the recipe a bit though after reading the other reviews: Used butter flavored shortening (and a little extra) instead of plain ol' shortening; put in a little over a Tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons... I think that the butter flavored shortening helped tone down any extra floury taste. I also had to cook it a little longer than suggested. Was a hit at work and at home... Even with the adjustments would recommend eating with a favorite beverage on hand (mine turned out a tad bit dry the first time... second time though PERFECT!) Thank you!",
