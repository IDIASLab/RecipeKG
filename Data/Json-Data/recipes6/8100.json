        "description": "I ate a lot of instant ramen noodles as a kid and still enjoy them now on occasion. As an adult, I started experimenting with them to try different ways of eating them other than the package directions. This one isn't the most feasible but it was a lot of fun to make. The bun is seasoned and crunchy so it's like you get the burger, bun, and chips in every bite. I like to top mine with Sriracha mayo, red onions, and baby spinach but feel free to use your favorite toppings.",
