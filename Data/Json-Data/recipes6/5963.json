I'm glad that I did because it added flavor but the soup was still bland. This needs more than just salt and pepper to season in my opinion. I ended up adding several different herbs and that helped a great deal. It didn't have much eye appeal so I threw in a handful of frozen peas and carrot mixture for some color. I ended up making it work but as written this is extremely bland. Sorry.",
