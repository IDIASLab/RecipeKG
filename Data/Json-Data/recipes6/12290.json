The flavor is just perfect. I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice. And after the 15 minutes cooking time my filling was still just as soupy as when I started. So I increased the heat and brought it to a quick boil and then removed from heat. It thickend right up. I would have liked it to be a little firmer so maybe I will increase the boil time when I make again. I live at high altitude so maybe that is why it didn't thicken right. Will definately be used again and again. We love lemon!",

Then I also topped these with a meringue to make them like mini lemon meringue pies. The crust worked wonderfully and was the perfect amount for 24 tassies. After baking I used a teaspoon to re-indent the cups and they were ready for the filling. Everyone at the party really enjoyed these and they were gone quickly.",

As a result we had lots of extra filling! We put the rest into a small pie crust. This recipe still gets 5 stars because it was so yummy!",
