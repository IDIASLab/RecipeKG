I also found the poking with a fork to not only be unnecessary, but actually causes juices to escape from the chicken.  I would also season BOTH sides of the chicken before putting it in the skillet. You will also need to cook this at a higher temp. Low is not really going to brown the chicken.  I started mine at medium, then lowered it to medium-low for 7 minutes on the first side, and 5 on the second. I had pounded the chicken breasts down to an even 1\" thickness before starting. The breasts came out juicy and I liked the added lemon flavor.",
