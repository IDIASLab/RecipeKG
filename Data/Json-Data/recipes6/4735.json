I just got it for a present and was excited and a bit scared (that pressure thing kind of freaks me out, but anyway).  I was skeptical that carrots, which take FOREVER for me to cook, would cook in 7 minutes.  They so did!  Awesome!  As for the recipe itself, I added some more curry and salt and pepper at the end.  I did leave out green onions (didn't have) and subbed sweet potatoes (already cooked, courtesy of my mother) at the end instead of potatoes, which I don't have.  And as we are in the middle of a hurricane, I felt it was prudent not to go out in it for potatoes.  I also didn't have cream, so I just put in half the amount of milk.  Worked well--maybe not as thick as it would be with cream, but it was nice.  I served with Wheat and Barley bread I'd made for dinner, and it was a nice, warm dinner on a cold, windy and rainy evening.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Sorry to say that I made a few minor changes they are as follows: I did not use heavy cream (coffee cream was all I had and I didnt use quite as much as the recipe called for maybe 2 cups?) I did not put in the green onion as there was enough with the original chopped onions in base and I added a little cumin with the curry. I also grated in about a 2 inch knob of ginger root and only used about 4 cloves of garlic but probably could have been braver and tried using all 8! I was a bit afraid of it being overwhelming. It pureed beautifully and was a warm and hearty soup! Also if you enjoy a garnish....we swirled some yogurt that had been mixed with a bit of curry on top. It added a nice swirl of colour to the orange hue of the soup. Culinary and visual art! It was a great dish and could be a hearty meal with some rustic bread or croutons. I keep forgetting to use my pressure cooker and this soup worked amazingly well in it. Quick and easy.",

I didn't have green onions, so just chopped one large regular onion and used half-and-half (2 cups) at the end.  Mashed sweet potatoes were also on hand, so I added them once the carrots were done cooking - I was also surprised that the carrots were done in only 7 minutes.  I chopped about 7-8 large carrots, and did not need additional cooking time.  Because I like my soup a bit spicy, I added some cumin and cayenne at the end.  Very yummy - I will be making this often during the cold weather!  thank you!",

Both ways are 5 stars.  \n\nMy changes are doubling the curry powder, skipping the potato, and using a can of coconut milk in place of the cream (I have an electric pressure cooker, so I always do a half recipe).  It's thicker with the potato, but I prefer the taste of the soup without it.  Substituting coconut milk does not make it taste like coconut, but it makes it healthier.",

It was very bland; maybe my carrots were flavorless to start with I don't know. It just tasted so boring. Roasting them first might have helped. Anyways I wasn't going to let that much soup go to waste so I ended up adding some extra things to make the flavor brighter (doubled the curry added at least 1 T. of dill 1 tsp of ground ginger and about 2 T. of white vinegar). Even with my additions I will not make again but I at least thought it was all right. I got the ideas for ginger and dill from the food network website.",
