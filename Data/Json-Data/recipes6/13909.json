It is supposed to read ONE TABLESPOON onion juice, not a whole onion!!!!!  No wonder some people said it was too onion-y!  Honestly, I don't believe I submittied it that way, maybe a typo when Allrecipes posted it.  So sorry it came out that way!  It really is a great dressing.  Additionally I've found it gets by very well with only 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup.",

I added a little balsamic vinegar (the brand I use is strong and rather sweet) for a bit more flavor. I mixed this in the blender adding the oil in a small stream so I ended up with a mayonnaise-like dressing and then added the poppy seeds. On baby spinach with fresh raspberries and crumbled blue cheese it was an ideal summer evening salad.",
