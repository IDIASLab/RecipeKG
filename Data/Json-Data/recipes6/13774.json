I have fed this casserole to practically everyone I know, and not one person (NOT ONE!!) has failed to say that it is delicious, unbelieveable, amazing, etc. Every time I make it someone asks for the recipe. Here's what I do differently: instead of regular fried onions I use the cheddar kind. I use salted butter (don't substitute margarine, please!), and the most important change - use crushed Club brand crackers (white, rectangular, buttery crackers) instead of bread crumbs. Makes all the difference in the world. I also use less cheddar cheese because I can't make it all fit in my dish. This is wonderful. Try it.",

Pretty much kept to the recipe except for substituting the bread crumbs for the Club brand crackers.  To be quite honest, I will just use the recipe ingredient as is next time.  With the mayo, butter, cheddar and French fried onions, I think there is enough taste (and calories) in order to just stick to the bread crumbs.  However, THIS MAKES A LOT OF FOOD.  I should have read the recipe more closely when it said that I needed a six quart casserole dish.  I halved it (or more precisely, made two batches) and had more than enough for our little family of four.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I preferred sauteeing the squash in the butter and I added about a 1/4 cup of wine and seasoned well with salt and pepper.  I beat the eggs in another bowl and added the mayo, sugar and cheese to it (I added some parm too... I just love parm flavor).  And instead of breadcrumbs, I crushed some Ritz crackers and sprinkled them on the bottom and the top.  It was a MAJOR household pleaser!!  Thanks so much!",
