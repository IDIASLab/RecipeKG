Apply liberally to meat and let sit overnight for best flavor. The brown sugar helps make a nice bark. Makes enough to cover two 8-pound pork butts or 6 racks of ribs.",

I'm not a big fan of the \"bark.\" I know this is sacrilege for bbq but it usually tastes burnt to me. The bark on this pork butt had a wonderful depth of flavor. It had a sweeter taste without the deep char flavor. It really added to the taste of the pulled pork. Recipe note: used paprika not smoked paprika",

They had the perfect balance of smokiness and sweet thanks to the smoked paprika and brown sugar. The sight of the bark made my mouth water and first bite in did not disappoint  Only doing half rack of ribs I had some leftover so I ran out and grabbed a pork butt and 2 cornish hens. Perfection on those as well. 5 star rub and one I will definitely use again. Brisket is next and I cannot wait to fire up the smoker again!",
