I never had corn pudding before, but saw the recipe on Chef John's website before Thanksgiving and made it as one of our side dishes exactly as written.  On the video, he recommends using a blender to break up the corn as much as possible.  My blender was broken and I did the best I could with my old food processor to break up the corn, but ended up with plenty of fairly large sized kernel skins. Although it tasted wonderful, the skins didn't enhance the texture IMO. Despite that, the pudding turned out so creamy and moist -almost delicate- even with a lovely browned crust.  It just barely held its shape as it was scooped out of the pan, and fell apart in the mouth.  It would taste great with a summer BBQ and anytime really.",

That being said, the ingredients with heavy (whipping) cream, butter, six eggs, 4 cups of corn, well, its expensive and calorie dense!   This dish although delicious, is simply not worth the effort and cost.  All I really needed was some corn bread and that costs 10 times less and the taste is as satisfying.   This is the only reason this is rated as 4 vs 5.  I think eggs, butter, and whipping cream are better reserved for a fancy soup or deserts.  I wont be making this again for that reason.",
