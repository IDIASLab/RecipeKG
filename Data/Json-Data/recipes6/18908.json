I modified ingredients based on what was available and came out excellent probably not quite as spicy as the original as the bird chilies weren't to be found. Makes a great sauce for pork or chicken when mixed with plain yogurt can be used as a stir-fry sauce and was yummy just plain on top of smoked oysters. One thing that seemed nice was to toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a dry skillet before blending. Next time I will add the chilies after blending the rest so that the sauce is slightly chunky instead of pureed.",

I will double the recipe next time. I used jalapenos. As a professional chef I knew that the Bird's Eye peppers (AKA: Thai Peppers) would be too hot for my family. If you have a Caputo's Store near you they often carry Thai Peppers. I did add 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. To those who found it too salty it depends on what kind of salt you are using. Table salt kosher salt & sea salts have different levels of flavor so start with half of what the recipe calls for and go from there. Keep in mind that depending on what kind of peppers you use the sauce will be green yellow or red. Thanks you for a wonderful recipe. We will showcase this recipe at our restaurant in the near future.",

We literally couldn't taste anything but salt which totally ruined this for me. I tried to mellow out the sodium by dumping half of the batch and adding more of every other ingredient but the flavors still weren't balanced; it just tasted like a spicy very salty pesto. I made a last-ditch effort at using the harissa by mixing some with coconut milk and adding it to a simple garlic reduction I was making for chicken. It was passable but no better than that.
