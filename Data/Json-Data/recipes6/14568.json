The bread did get brown long before the inside was done; 40 minutes in I turned the temp down to 325 and gave it another 15 minutes to cook it all the way through. The taste is great though just the right amount of cinnamon and apples. UPDATE: Made this again using the exact ingredients as the recipe states. I put some in muffin tins and they took about 15 minutes to bake.",

What a wonderfully delicious cake like bread. I chose to make this in 1 Bundt pan rather than making two loaves. I added just a sprinkling of nutmeg to the batter. Then I sprinkled with confectionary sugar after baking. Baking time in the Bundt pan took 45-50 minutes at the 350 degrees. I set my timer to check with a cake tester 5 minutes earlier to help prevent drying out and over baking. My first slice I tried plain loved it. The second slice I tried with peanut butter. YUMMY! This bread went perfectly with a cup of coffee. I decided to send a sample slice of this bread and recipe to the people I pass the starter onto. After trying this recipe I decided to keep a starter for myself and start over so I can make this bread again and also freezing a starter to use at a later time. For those that don t have the starter you can find the recipe for Amish Friendship Bread Starter here at All Recipes.",
