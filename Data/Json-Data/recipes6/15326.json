With the double boiler I can stir and monitor it more and I leave the water simmering when I take the top pot off and dip the cookies. Then if the chocolate gets too stiff I just put it back on the boiling water for a few seconds and stir. Be careful not to get ANY water or moisture in the chocolate!! It will SEIZE UP and be totally unusable. (Ask me how I know...)",
