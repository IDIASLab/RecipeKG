Traditional Japanese mochi is made from sweet rice flour  mixed with water, steamed, and formed into small patties filled with sweetened red bean paste and lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar. This butter mochi cake is a westernized version of the traditional mochi, for it incorporates butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla and is baked.",

I on the other hand have always enjoyed the Japanese variety in food (as well as many other cultures) and have become accustomed to dishes containing such things as nori (seaweed) red bean raw fish wasabi (green horseradish) and other aspects. If you are not one for meals other than medium-rare meat and potatoes then you definitely will not cherish such a recipe. But if you like your tastebuds to soar on other not-so-common levels then you really should try this recipe and others like it!;) Brandi",

Also I think I might cut back on the butter next time or not grease the dish as there was butter literally pooling on the top of the cake when I took it out of the oven. The texture and flavor were spot on and I will definitely make this again with the tweaks mentioned.",
