I did not use one today and some of the chips were not crispy in the middle but burnt on the ends. I ate the most anyway but the kids would not eat the dark ones. I also used canola oil. I served this with a maple yogurt dipping sauce from AR (equal amount of yogurt and maple pinch of salt mix). Thank you for the recipe will be making this again.",
