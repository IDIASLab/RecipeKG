It is soooo good! Highly reccommended! Original review: I saw this recipe on the community reviews and just had to try it! It is simmering on the stove and making the house smell so good! So for smell alone, I am rating it 5 stars. Will update about taste. Thanks for the great autumn recipe! Taste update: This was great! I poured this into an afternoon cup of coffee. Wow! A taste sensation! Try this, you won't be disappointed!",

I didn't think there was enough \"gingerbread\" flavor in the beginning so I crushed the ginger a little and that help release more flavor.

We used this in our coffee along with some half and half and it made a nice treat. Thanks for sharing.",

I think I tripled the ginger rather than mashing it or grating it as others suggested because I don't have any coffee filters or cheesecloth to strain the sediment through. It's good but the sweet to flavour ratio means that to get a good flavour in a cup of coffee you need to have it pretty sweet. I need to play with it more. I am thinking of adding more ginger to it and then mixing some of the syrup with lemon and brandy as a cough remedy. Ginger pepper cloves and cinnamon are very healing.",
