You don't cook this one. It's called a sauce but it's more like juice. Being raised in eastern NC this \"sauce\" is used on pig smoked outdoors. It's great on a lot of things but you'll have to understand what this is to appreciate it. It's more like a spicy seasoned vinegar - traditionally used at pig pickins (google it if you aren't sure what a pig pickin is)",
