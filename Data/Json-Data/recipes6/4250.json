But not really knowing much about harissa, I wasn't sure if lemon juice was acceptable and I didn't want to possibly ruin it.  So I looked at another recipe in Bon Appetit and sure enough they added white wine vinegar and lemon juice to their recipe.  So I went ahead and added 1 tsp of white wine vinegar and 2 tsp of lemon juice, gave it a whizz, and it was delicious!  So thank you for providing the base recipe to start with.",
