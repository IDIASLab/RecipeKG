We wanted something a little lighter to stray away from the heavy Christmas cookies and sweets and this was just right. I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour (omitting 2 tbsp per cup as recommended by this site) and used lemon yogurt instead of plain. It has the right amount of lemon flavor and doesn't need a frosting, I just sprinkled confectioner's sugar over the top. A great cake and one to add to my recipe box for the future, thanks.",

It is so moist and light and down right delicious. I drizzled some thin icing/glaze over the top as well as a slight dusting of powdered sugar since the cake on its own was not as sweet as I usually like but other than that it's perfect! Just a tip...Don't Throw Away Your Yolks!! I am so used to separating my eggs and discarding the yolks for making white cake and I wasn't paying attention when realized I had by habit thrown away the yolks instead of using them for the first part of the batter...Ughhh!",

Everyone loves it. These are now my tried and true tweaks to this recipe: Do the step of beating the egg whites and folding them in LAST. Make it super-lemony by using 1/4 cup lemon juice and the zest from two large-ish lemons (for a full recipe). Use only 75% of the sugar (reduce it in the egg yolks mixture of course not the egg whites). If possible use Greek yogurt. This cake is HUGE. Easily 16 servings or a bit more or less depending on preference. Depending on what I had on hand I have used all butter; margarine/oil /applesauce; margarine/oil; golden shortening. This cake needs no icing! It's delicious by itself.",

This did not end up anything as dense as a pound cake. Also I used the zest of two lemons and it turned out perfectly lemony. My suggestion is to make sure you whip the egg whites properly. Wash all the utensils/bowls properly so there is no residual grease on them. Don't start adding the sugar until you have achieved soft peaks. Keep whipping until stiff glossy peaks and if you rub the foam between your fingers you don't feel the sugar. Also mix in about a third of the egg whites to lighten the stiff batter before trying to fold in the rest. A five star recipe. EDIT I've made this recipe again substituting sour cream for the yogurt and I think I like it that way even better! I halved the recipe and it made 12 lovely cupcakes.",
