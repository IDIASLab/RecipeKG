I used 4 more tablespoons of butter and thats it.  I live in the Carribean so things like cake flour are hard to find for household use.  This yields a softer and more tender crumb.  If you want an orange or lemon flavored cake, substitute the water for orange juice or lemonade and add grated rind to the butter sugar mixture.",
