However I'm on a low sodium diet and I think the dish suffers a great deal by leaving it out (my fault of course not the author). For others in the same situation I suspect that if I doubled down on the spices per serving it might be enough to bring out a stronger melody of flavor rather then sharing with the boiled potatoes.",

I didn\u2019t add any extras but did count calories when making this.\nI used 600g of Russet Potatoes (I had to hand at the time) and around 100g of very finely chopped yellow onions.  I used the suggested amount of oil in recipe and same for spices.  For my family this stretched 4 servings and worked out at 225cal per serving.  Hope this helps!\nThanks for posting this recipe, we all really enjoyed it!",
