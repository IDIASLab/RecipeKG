For people without machines, this recipe couldn't be simpler.  Warm the milk and add the sugar and the yeast. Stir and let sit for about 15 min. to proof (the yeast will foam). If it doesn't foam, your milk probably wasn't warm enough. Then add the foamy yeast mixture to the rest of the ingredients and mix.  This dough is easy to mix by hand so you really don't need the KitchenAid.  The dough will be sticky. So after mixing, cover and let it sit in the bowl to rise 1-2 hours. Punch down and let rise again or form into rolls at this time.  Super quick and easy.  If you want a sweeter, richer bread, increase sugar to 1/2 cup and add one extra egg yolk. If makikng one large loaf, bake for about 30-35 min. at 375.",

I use butter instead of margarine. The first few hundred loaves I made I used Red Star bread machine yeast and the results were better than with regular yeast. The difference is a bigger fluffier loaf of bread.  I used Mediterrainian sea salt a few times but it seemed to make no difference.  I have made this with cold egg and milk and it comes out the same as having the ingredients at room temperature.  The loaf comes out big and my biggest problem was storage of a gargantuan loaf of bread.  A couple of things worked out.  First, you can slice it up and put it in a couple of zip lock bags.  Second, you can\r\nstore it in a Renolyd's oven cooking bag.  This bread makes excellent toast(oh,yes), French toast, stuffing, sandwiches, and bread crumbs. It has a sweet flavor.  It is addicting, so be careful!",

I proofed the yeast with the sugar and warm milk in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, added the egg and melted butter, then all the dry ingredients. This dough needed another half cup of flour, I just added it by leveled 1/4 cup until it formed into a ball and jumped on the bread hook. I kneaded it with the hook for about five minutes, then formed it into a ball and let it rise on my warm oven in a greased bowl, covered. Once it doubled, I thought I'd be creative and make a Cinnamon Swirl bread. I rolled it out into a long rectangle, then sprinkled brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon over the dough, then rolled it up. I made sure the edges were sealed and set it to rise on the warm oven in the loaf pan for another hour or so. I baked this for about a half hour or so in 350* oven, or until it smelled done. After that, I set out to make a batch just as recipe stated. Either way, it's a wonderful bread with just a touch of sweetness and richness. Very soft, close to a bakery bread in texture. Amazing bread. This one's a keeper, no matter which way I choose to use it. THREE DAYS LATER: I've now made this bread six times and we just can't get enough, either in cinnamon-swirl form or regular. Outstanding!",
