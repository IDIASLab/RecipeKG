The ratio of water to lentil/rice is 2:1.  After reading all of the reviews, clearly the amount of liquid is one issue, so I upped it to 3:1.  It could have used more, but oh well.  Also, reviewers complained about blandness.  Well, this is a site where everyone tweaks things according to their own preferences (aside from those who substitute raspberries for jalapenos and salmon for beef and peas for potatoes, decide to cook it on a Coleman instead of the oven and then say it was terrible).  So I added chopped sweet peppers, cumin, red pepper flakes and italian seasoning and used all chicken broth instead of water.  Length of cooking time seems to also be an issue, so I only cooked it 4 hours on low which was enough.  It turned out to be a fine lentil and rice dish.  It is by no means soup, but it does taste good. Whether or not I will make it again, I do not know.  It does make a good side dish or quick meal.",

I believe this recipe has a misprint; the dry lentils and rice should only be 1 cup each or maybe even 1/2 cup each. I used 2c lentil and only 1c rice and there was no liquid left after 7 hours of cooking. I salvaged the soup by transferring it to a stock pot added 6 cups of chicken stock that I had been thawing anyway plus more water til it was a soup consistency. I simmered it on the stove for another half hour to soften the lentils that didn't cook through added a little Polish Sausage and it was pretty good soup but I've got a gallon of it now! I actually will try this soup again using a half cup each of lentils and brown rice.",
