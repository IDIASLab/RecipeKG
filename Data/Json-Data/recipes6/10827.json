Also, there were chocolate swirls in the baked cake even though I mixed the cocoa/food coloring paste well and beat the paste thoroughly into the shortening/sugar/egg mixture. The frosting was nice--I hadn't tried that before and liked it.  The 2nd time, I modifed the recipe based on a suggestion of another reviewer.  I substituted 1 cup oil for 1/2 cup shortening and 2 cups sugar for 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Also, I added 1-2 extra tablespoons of cocoa powder.  What a difference!  The cake was very moist with a stronger flavor (more traditional).  The color was gorgeous.  I split the layers and frosted with a double batch of cream cheese frosting.  Yummy! Everyone went nuts over the 2nd cake.  I have a small dessert business and I received 2 orders (for the holidays)for the 2nd version of the cake after friends/clients tasted it.  Thanks for the suggestions.",

Not sure why so many think that \"cream cheese frosting\" belongs on a red velvet cake.  I'm so delighted that this cake has no cream cheese frosting -sorry but cream cheese frosting is NOT the traditional frosting on red velvet cake.  Kudos to you for posting a recipe that is *Almost* like my family recipe, ours calls for 3 Tbsp of cocoa, and no vinegar. The vinegar is un-necessary, especially when the recipe contains buttermilk.",

I used one cup of oil instead of the shortening, two cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups, and an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder.  Also, I only used 1 ounce of food color because that's all I had and it gave it a nice red color.  I think 2 ounces would be overkill.  I did make the mistake, though, of sifting the cocoa powder together with the flour, and the food dye with the buttermilk, thinking it made more sense to do it that way, but I ended up with some brown swirls.  \nThe second time I made this, I did everything except I made the cocoa powder and food color into a paste like you're supposed to and the color turned out an even red color.  Also, the second time I made it into cupcakes and baked them at 325 degrees for about 25 min.  The frosting is to die for!  I'll be using that on most every cake from now on!

                "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful traditional Red Velvet Cake recipe and the frosting puts it over the top. Having read through the comments I think this recipe is problematic because people have made modifications that effect the chemistry of the cake. RV cake gets it's rich red color from the baking soda reacting with the Ducth processed cocoa. Vinegar and buttermilk are the acidic ingredients that are the catalyst for the b. Soda. This leavening reaction creates CO2 which effects the cakes volume along with the taste texture and color. Substituting baking powder can cause the cake to be crumbly overbrown and bitter. It's also not recommended to exchange solid fats - shortening with liquid oils. Solid fats when beaten with sugar hold air bubbles making the cake moist.. Oils don't hold the air bubbles this makes the cake dense and dry. The baker's rule only substitute like for like. If you don't want to use shortening then you can sub butter so long as the fat content is at least 80%. For 1/2 cup shortening sub 1/2 cup butter 1 tbsp of water. Also when greasing the pans it's best to use shortening butter or oils can be absorbed into the batter as the cake bakes causing it to stick to the pan.",

I did not use the frosting recipe because I wanted a cream cheese frosting and even though this one is advertised as cream cheese, it does not contain any.  Instead, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was divine (with modifications).  Thanks for a good bare bones recipe but do make modifications before trying it yourself!",

                "reviewBody": "Very Yummy.  And I am not much of a chocolate fan. I added the one cup oil, instead of the shortening.  I also added 2 cups sugar, total. And increased cocoa to 4 TBSPs. I didn't make a cocoa food coloring paste.  I added the food coloring to the buttermilk and the cocoa to the butter sugar mixture.  The color was beautiful, no swirls, and the flavor was amazing. I used a store bought vanilla frosting.  This is one of my favorite cakes.  I think next time I will use 1 TBSP of vinegar, as most other redvelvet cakes call for that amount, even the other one by Eleanor Johnson (who did this recipie too.)",
