The day of the shower, I took the punch from the freezer about an hour before serving to let it thaw a little. Put it in my punch bowl and added the ginger ale.  It made a delicious slushy punch.  I will definately use this recipe again in the future.  Thanks for sharing!!",

I've used cherry flavored drink mix packets and with the pineapple juice the punch tastes like a liquid version of the 'Big Stick' popsicle sticks I used have as a child. The first time I made it I froze it (before adding the ginger ale) and took it out about 2 hours before my party. Unfortunately that was not nearly enough time and the punch was still frozen. So my husband spent a while with an ice pick chipping away at the frozen ice punch block. The end result was a very nice slushee punch which everyone enjoyed but I highly recommend taking it out at least 7 hours before your party. That's what I did this last time I made the punch and the result was perfect. 2/11/05 I'm amending my review. I made this today for a baby shower (half recipe) and as another reviewer had suggested I put only 1 cup sugar 1 quart water and 2 liters of ginger ale. It turned out perfect! That's how I am going to make it from now on. Yummy...",
