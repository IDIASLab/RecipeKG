I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out as I expected - it looked beautiful. I served it for Christmas dessert and it was such a disappointment. It was ok at best - don't get me wrong it wasn't bad it just wasn't anything more than mediocre and for the amount of time and steps it took it definitely wasn't worth it.",
