I used salted butter (omitted the salt) fat-free yogurt and semisweet chocolate chips since I had them in the house. I live at about 6000 ft. and didn't make any adjustments for that but it turned out great anyway. This is tasty the way it is but could also carry a glaze nicely. This cake is best when still warm. Keep it tightly wrapped or in an air-tight container and eat it within a couple of days as it has a tendency to get firm and dry.",

Great way to get rid of yogurt and cream cheese... I was at the verge of throwing out.",
