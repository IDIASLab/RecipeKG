I have used different kinds of jello some I have liked better than others but it is always a great dish. I also finely crush pretzels and sprinkle on top. The sugar & sweet is Y-U-M-M-O! One thing to caution is this may not be good for a picnic or potluck if dish will be out for a period of time only becuause jello will melt. If you have a ice cooler with room no worries... otherwise consider this if dish will be out over an hour. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!! One of my very favorites!",
