I followed the ingredients exactly (used 1% milk since it didn't specify) but I baked the pudding in 4 (10 oz.) ramekins. It set up perfectly. I think maybe the people that had trouble with setting up didn't cook it on the stove long enough. You have to bring it to a full rolling boil and stir constantly until it is very thick almost like oatmeal. It took the full 10 minutes of cooking to get thick enough. If you miss that step no matter how long you bake it in the oven it will not set up. This was a great comfort food and I will absolutely make it again.",
