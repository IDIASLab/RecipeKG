This recipe is versatile, can easily be doubled and more veggies and ham can be added as desired. It is a great way to use the rest of that spiral ham; just be sure to trim all the fat. Adjust water and stock as needed. Especially if reheating, more stock or water should be added. Serve with crusty bread and enjoy!",

I prepared as written with the exception of using two medium sized potatoes, peeled and diced, and about half of the carrots called for.  I added them in after the boil down to simmer, and just let it go for a hour and a half.  Delicious.  Perhaps not as \"hearty\" as the submitter intended, but excellent none the less!",

I'm sure great as written but here's what I did differently: in place of the onion sauteed a full container of Trader Joe's Mirepoix (celery/carrots/onion) for a looong time until the onions caramelized (the 2T oil was ample); used half yellow & half green split peas (because that's what I had); finally when adding the last of the potatoes & carrots (to an almost full pot with no room for any ham) added 2 tsp. Smoked Paprika 1 tsp. coarse salt & one 14.5 oz. can chicken broth. With some buttered rye bread it was a perfect meal...can't wait for lunch tomorrow. Thanks Jan:)",
