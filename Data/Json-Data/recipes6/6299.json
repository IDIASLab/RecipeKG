That said, the recipe was really not good and I don't believe that it would have been good had I not burnt them. I did add about twice the broth and 2 cans of coconut oil. I also only had powdered curry, I don't know if it was the kind she specified. Because we are in the middle of the COVID hunker down stage, I could not just throw out the dish so I salvaged it by adding a bit of lime juice (maybe a tsp, to help resolve the bitterness) and about 1/4 C sugar. I also added about a T of red curry paste and a tsp of salt. The good news is that the chicken was very tender and easy to eat. I'm sorry to leave such a negative review. I hope others find it better than we did.",
