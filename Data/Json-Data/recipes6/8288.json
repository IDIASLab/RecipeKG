I'll make it that way again tonight.  I'm going to add 1/2 c. of Kalamata olives too because we love them and I think they will go well.  I can't wait to eat this again!!!",

First I would definitely add more clams about 3 cans more. I also would saut\u00e9 all of the ingredients in the white wine before adding the tomato sauce to infuse the flavors and unless you like your pasta with barely any sauce. I would add the spaghetti noodles to the sauce as you go. I feel a pound of noodles are too much as my noodles absorbed all of the sauce. So the next day I made another batch of sauce this time adding a teaspoon more of the anchovy sauce and more clams! Thanks for this recipe!",
