I also used a couple of different types of preserves. I don't have apricot so I used a prune plum jam (not the best since it had HUGE pieces of fruit in it) and a cherry raspberry jam I'd made earlier this year. Although both tasted good the cherry rasberry was the best for keeping in the jam itself. I'd recommend a jelly or a jam with very tiny pieces of fruit or seeds--otherwise the fruit oozes out too. Also be careful with the amount. You don't want it to ooze too much...I baked on alum foil bc I didn't want to scrub my pans for hours. Thanks for the recipe!",
