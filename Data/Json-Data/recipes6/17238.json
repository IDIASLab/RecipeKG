She used brown rice in place of the basmatti and used brown sugar instead of white. Somehow the rice never cooked. It never absorbed the water. My guess it that the sugar coated the rice so much that it couldn't cook. She cooked it for at least 45 mins and it was still hard. We tried to eat it- but it was very very sweet- and the cashews were soggy. Seems to me the cashew and the raisins could be added last- instead of cooking them with the rice. - and use add less sugar- as the previous review suggests.",

The method of cooking the rice and adding the ingredients doesn't really work. Use your usual method add the saffron to the water and let it cook together with the rice then add the rest of your flavorings as soon as you determine all the water is absorbed stir it all in cover tightly and allow to rest for five minutes or so. There is enough heat and residual moisture. I cut the sugar to 2 tbs. And last fishing for the cloves is a nuisance I just used 1/4 tsp ground cloves and left out the whole. I just wish I knew if this is meant to be a sweetish side dish or a very mildly sweet dessert. Either way it is very tasty!",

First 1/4 cup of sugar seems way too much so I only used 1 tablespoon. Next time I'll try it without any sugar because the raisins provide plenty of sweet. I also used regular butter and just threw everything together into the rice cooker at the same time although I did let the saffron soak a few minutes first. Much simpler and a delicious result!",
