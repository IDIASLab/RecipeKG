I don't have a bread machine, so had to give it a shot without but it turned out great.  In lieu of milk powder I modified the liquid to 3/4 C Water and 1/2 C Milk.  I proofed the yeast in my Kitchen-Aid bowl with warm water and 1 Tbsp of the sugar.  Once that was ready I mixed in the remaining ingredients, let the dough hook knead for awhile, then put the dough into a well oiled bowl and covered to rise for about an hour until double in size. Punched it down and then split into 6-8 balls of dough for flatbread and let those rise about 30-40 more minutes. Rolled each one out and oiled and grilled per the instructions (only takes a couple minutes per side).  I topped with cooked chicken, bacon, cheddar, tomatoes and ranch dressing.  The bread really made the sandwich!",
