I rolled them into large walnut shaped balls and pressed a fork with sugar in a crosscut pattern.  I baked them for almost 15 minutes and they did not burn.  I asked Husband to rate them.  For him it was a definite 10.  I then proceeded to ask each our our four sons who also gave it a 10.  After the first batch I decided to flatten them more and sprinkle with sugar.  They cooked much quicker.  I have found with this cookie cook them till the top turns slightly white.  let them cool for 5 minutes then transfer to plate or platter.  Ours made 20 cookies.  I ended up making another batch a little later in the evening and made a BIG cookie with chocolate chips pressed into the cookie.  It made 1 pizza pan sized cookie.  Thanks for the great and easy Recipe.  I will definitely make this one again.",

Peanut butter is probably my favorite food but until today, I never much liked PB cookies because of their dry, crunchy texture that left you gasping for milk.  This recipe was PERFECT and SOOOO easy!!  I felt like a snack today so I halved the recipe-- used 1/2 cup sugar and PB and used only the egg WHITE from an egg (cut out some extra fat and cholesterol).  I rolled the dough into balls and then smooshed them with a fork in the classic criss-cross pattern, baked them for 11 minutes at 350 and let them cool on the sheet for like 3-5 minutes (more like three because I couldn't wait to try them).  The half batch made 9 decent-sized cookies-- perfect for two people.  I'll only use this recipe from now on... it was moist, peanutbuttery and QUICK!  THANK YOU!!",
