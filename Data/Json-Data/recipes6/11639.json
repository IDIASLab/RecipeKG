I made it with 3 large potatoes (a bit more than 3 cups) and used 2/3 cups white sugar and about 1/4 cup maple syrup (I love it in just about everything!) Next time I would make less topping about 3/4's because that made it too sweet. But I love the consistancy with the eggs and the topping is yummy with coconut and pecans! Thanks! It's a great recipe to work with:)",

I did cut down on the amount of sugar in both the potatoes and the topping because all I had were canned sweet potatoes and they were packed in a light syrup. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet. I used 1/2 c white sugar in the potatoes and 1/2 c brown sugar in the topping. It turned out perfect! This will be a staple at every Thanksgiving now - SO much better than the boring old marshmallow topped sweet potatoes!",

Very very similar except for the top layer. Every time my mother would make it it'd be slightly different. Raisins are a standard filling however sometimes she ll substitute pineapple sliced walnuts chocolate chips or marshmallows. Had to come here for the recipe to surprise my family. After tasting we all agreed it was really close however there should be brown sugar instead of white sugar as well as more cinnamon and butter. If you want to create an absolutely unforgettable dish add a graham cracker crust!",
