The change I made to the recipe is I beat the eggs. Put a bit of the hot chocolate mixture in a separte bowl and whisk the eggs into the bowl of chocolate to prevent the eggs from cooking (the \"scramble\" effect), pour the remaining hot chocolate mixture into the bowl of chocolate/egg mixture, whisking constantly, until throughly mixed. Then I will add the vanilla and salt and pecans.  I probably use more that 1 cup of pecans.",

I was too busy and too full to try the dessert and when cleaning up the kitchen I decided to pack up the few leftovers and send it back home with her husband (I was trying to save space in the fridge). When my other guests learned that I had returned the remaining pie they were sooooo disappointed saying it was the best pie they had ever eaten and I was crazy to have given it up. When I tried the pie a day later I have to admit that it was fantastic. I should let you know that she mistakenly used 1 cup of butter (instead of only 1/2) and I don't know if that error added even more to its \"fantasticness\". I can't wait to make this myself! update: I made this last night and made the terrible error of adding the eggs to the hot chocolate mixture and taking my time before mixing it all together. What happened? Some of the eggs cooked resulting in chunks of scrambled eggs in the pie! Gross!!! I picked out the chunks of egg ruining the look of the pie but it still tasted fine. How does this pie taste hot out of the oven? Ugh. How does it taste after a night of chilling in the refrigerator? Deeelish.",

It was a quick and easy dessert, though, and my kids enjoyed it.  If you aren't really, really into a chocolatey taste, then I'd suggest cutting back on the cocoa powder a bit.  It wasn't an overpowering taste, I just felt the pecan pie taste was lost in it.\r\n\r\nEdited to add:  I just pulled this out of the fridge to try it again, and it was SO much better after it was chilled for a few hours.  The middle became a lot more creamy and smooth, almost a hot fudge consistency.  I will make this again but make sure it's been well chilled before serving.",

I normally find pecan pie (and any chocolate varieties) far too sweet for more than a sliver but this recipe makes a delicious chocolate pecan pie.

I used 1 stick of butter instead of margarine and used a refrigerated ready-made pie crust. Simple and delicious!",

I read some reviews and just couldn't believe some people expecting this pie to taste like a regular pecan pie, it is NOT a regular pecan pie , it is not supposed to taste like one. I used pecan halves instead of chopped ones. I heated up the mixture in MED/LO stirring constantly, it takes a little while but you'll know it is ready when the mixture thins, it will not thicken up like pudding and such things do. I let it cool for a while and then i put it in the refrigerator overnight. It might be kind of watery otherwise. Enjoy!",
