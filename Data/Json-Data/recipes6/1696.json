I used homemade shells instead of store-bought frozen shells as I usually have a dozen stashed in the freezer for those quick butter tart baking days. I found the recipe a bit liquidy but decided to forge ahead without any changes to the recipe.(there would be ample opportunity for that next time) After the allotted 12minute cook time they still jiggled to much for my liking. Back to the oven for 3 more minutes. Once cooled time for a drizzle of chocolate. Overall a nice change in a butter tart. I did like the combination of the sweet and the chocolate. A keeper recipe for sure",

The combination of the sweet butter tart mixture really compliments the bitterness of the unsweetened chocolate leaving you with an incredibly ooey gooey chocolate surprise! I cooked these at 400 for 15 mins because i already had my oven set to that temp from dinner. This is a great recipe especially for the chocolate lover. Thank you MommaBear for this recipe!",

It's exactly what the title says: a chocolate butter tart.The bottom half is pure chocolate. Then there is a layer of butter tart filling on top.The only thing I did differently was add a bit of butter to the melted chocolate drizzle so it would be more flexible.This is a yummy recipe but next time I would try adding a few pecans to give it a \"Turtle\" effect.Would definitely make again.",

I used pre-made tart shells baked at 450 for 12 minutes some of my tarts boiled over but just barely. The brand of shell I used were a little more flaky than I would prefer for a butter tart but once it was in my mouth no complaints!",
