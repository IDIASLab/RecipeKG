I'm glad to have found this recipe, it's one I've been looking for after tasting them at a potluck a while back. My husband would eat the entire pan! I chopped the apples rather than sliced, they distribute through the batter better in smaller pieces. I don't melt the butter, Ijust cream it with the sugar and beat in the egg. Don't be scared if the batter is stiff and it seems like it is mostly apples, that's how it is supposed to be and it will turn out fine. Also, when you take them out of the oven, sprinkle cinnamon sugar generously over the top...HEAVENLY!",

Also top the batter with 3 T. softened butter, 1/3 brown sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon mixed together until crumbly. For me, it seemed to take closer to an hour to bake it Vs the 35 minutes stated in the recipe. Baker Jim, this is a wonderful recipe and thanks for sharing it with us!",

I creamed the butter with the sugar and eggs, added 1 t. vanilla, cut the apples to 2 (really 1 1/2 because mine were large), diced the apples and added them last to mixture.  I also used the topping of butter, br. sugar and cinnamon (spread the butter then sprinkler with sugar/cinnamon mixture) and baked for 45 minutes.  They turned out pretty moist, but have a delicious flavor; by no means a flop! I think cutting the apples to 1 cup or so(diced) might be key in getting more of a bar/brownie consistency that can be held in hand. I will make these again, I'm sure.",

I followed this recipe with a few minor adjustments - doubled the batch, 2.5 medium Granny Smith apples, a teaspoon of nutmeg and some dried cherries (about a half cup).  I too as many others had to increase the backing time to 55-60 minutes.  Started check at 45 minutes and the toothpick came out wet even at 60 minutes.  But, after the dish sat over night, it did come out a bit more sturdy but still more like a cobbler than a brownie.  Second try hit the mark.  Creamed the butter with the sugar instead of melting.  Added the eggs, dry ingredients and the apples and cherries last after combining all the others.  This turns out more like a dough than a batter and baked for 35 minutes.  Worked like a charm.  Apple brownies that are sill moist but cut like a brownie.  My test subjects liked both and I can use either depending on how I want to serve them.  Happy baking!",

I wanted these for a work function, where dealing with a too moist cake that doesn't stay in one piece wasn't an option. While the flavor is good, there's a fine line between being pleasantly moist and so moist it falls apart and borders on soggy.  I would call this an \"excessively moist\" apple cake, not an apple brownie.",
