As a matter of fact it is....bring on the Kimchi.  The contrasting textures are AMAZING.  This dish has me blown away.  The only concern I have is the leftovers.  The pork doesn't really stand up on it's own to well.  A 4 pound roast makes for a lot of leftovers.  I also think I'd add some garlic on the next round.  I'd make it again for sure.",
