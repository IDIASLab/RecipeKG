Because of my food sensitivities I omitted the black and cayenne peppers; left out the fines herbes because I didn't have them; doubled the fresh ginger; and used a bit of cumin and garam masala in lieu of curry powder. I don't know from two pounds so I used one bunch of my csa baby bok choy. It was my one-course meal. I ate the garlic and ginger slices for dessert. next time i may try for a sit-down meal and have a very simple fish or chicken filet minimally seasoned (the bok choy says it all) to accompany.",

I didn't measure the spices - just sprinkled with salt tumeric curry basil three cloves of garlic (for one big head of bok choy) and drizzled with olive oil. Took a bit longer than 10 minutes for some of the thicker stalks to become tender and most of them were pretty chewy despite the leaves being crisp. I liked the contrast of textures though.
