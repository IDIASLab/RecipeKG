The sauce does come out sticky, just as the title states.  We had homemade rolls,  'Cran-Broccoli Salad', 'Buttery New Potatoes with Leeks and Parsley' and 'Rhubarb-Raspberry Crunch' to go with the ribs.  All the recipes are found on AR.  We had an awesome meal.  Thanks SUNKIST2, for sharing your recipe.  It will be used again.",

However I cooked this in the slow cooker, about 6 hours on low, since I know for sure it will fall off the bone that way.  Once done, I removed the ribs, and placed the sauce in a pan, skimmed off the fat and boiled it for about 30 minutes to thicken up.  Then added some cornstarch slurry to really thicken it up, and poured back over the ribs.  Will definitely make again.",

I have made the sauce an entire 24 hours ahead of time, refrigerated, and then spread it over the ribs prior to baking.  If you follow the time instructions, your ribs will come out juicy, tender, and delicious.  I have tried broiling them for the last 5 minutes to give them a crusty top and that seems to make a good dish even better.  Great recipe, thank you.",
