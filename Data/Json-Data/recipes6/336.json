He told me he had learn to make when he was working down in Mexico in his younger days. It is easy but it does takes time to cure between steps. We have had mango sangria, peach-mango sangria, or pear-pineapple sangria. You can garnish with blueberries, mint leaves, or fresh peach slices if you would like.",

I used wonderfully sweet peaches in season and followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn\u2019t peel the peaches and used a submersion blender.  I didn\u2019t have triple sec, so I used Gran Marnier.  I didn\u2019t strain the juice since I like the pulp.  Also, I didn\u2019t feel like going out to get sparkling wine so I just added some Fresca for a single drink.  Its very potent even without the sparkling wine!  Will definitely make again - this needs to be shared w friends and family you like!",
