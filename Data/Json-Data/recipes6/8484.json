The night before Xmas dinner- took them out of the freezer & into the fridge then the next morning I warmed the meatballs in about a cup of simmering chicken stock in a covered fry pan for about 20 minutes added the rest of the glaze ingredients (plus another splash of stock) and heated thru and then put everything in a crock pot set on high for a little more than an hour when I tested a meatball & since it was cooked thru I put them out to be served. They were a big hit & got several compliments and a couple of recipe requests (especially when people found out that they were low-fat). If you're going to finish them in a crock pot add a little extra broth or stock (or I would think orange juice would work too) and keep an eye on them because the glaze WILL thicken",

Bring to a boil for about 45 minutes then let simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool. 3. I added paprika pepper flakes and juice from pickled jalapenos. 4.
