The only thing I did differently was that I used candied cherries and chopped them finely. ONLY because I had run out of maraschino cherries! Today I have to make more since they got eaten up immediately!! Thanks for sharing.",

Even though they are not baked they are a bit labor intensive as rolling into balls and coating with coconut and then I bag each cookie individually and tie with a ribbon. Worth it. My coworkers loved them too. I suggest having two bags of coconut as you might need extra for rolling in.",
