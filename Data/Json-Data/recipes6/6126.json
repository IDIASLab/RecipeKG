I whisked the egg whites until frothy, and then mixed those into the rest of the ingredients by hand, rather than using a blender.  Once it was sticking together, I just kneaded it on my countertop like I was making bread, until it was of uniform texture and well mixed.  To grind the almonds, I used my food processor, it worked really well.  I really wanted a strong almond flavour for the recipe I was making the marzipan for, so I doubled the along extract...next time I will probably add a little more.  All in all, this turned out really well, even with my changed.  Had a smooth, firm texture, nice colour, and great taste!  Will be making more this weekend for my Christmas baking projects!\n  *****As a side note, please read the directions and ingredients before making this recipe!  If you have issues with using raw eggs then use a different recipe!  It's not fair to rate a recipe low if you do not like the ingredients called for, just pick another one to make, there are plenty of recipes to be found online!*****",
