I looked at some other versions and they called for boiling so that is what I did. They turned out fine. I would also maybe put them in a 9 inch pan next time rather than a 9x13 and halve the chocolate topping. They were very thin. I would make them again and probably leave out the peanuts or even the chocolate as well. The cherry fudge layer was much better than I had expected. I made it for a lady at work who had requested it and I expected it to be disgustingly sweet. Turned out pretty good though.",
