Yes, I did saute the potatoes too along with the onions.  Used whole peeled marzano tomatoes instead of chopped. Just cut up the tomatoes a little with scissors to keep them chunky.  Also used flanken ribs instead of beef chuck because of the bones.  Makes a better broth.",

I usually make the recipe exactly as shown, but I made very minor changes to this one based only on my taste and heat preference.   On both the chili pepper and chipotle chili I used well-rounded teaspoons when measuring.  For the green chili, instead of canned, I used the roasted Hatch green chili found in the freezer section (I thought would be a little fresher taste).  That is it, everything else exactly as the recipe states.  My husband and I found this to have a rich spicy flavor without the heat.  Served with a little grated cheese and chopped green onions on top.   Even better the next day, or frozen and re-heated.",
