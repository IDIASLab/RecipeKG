Loosen the cake in the pan with a knife and place a plate over the pan then flip it over and tap a little on the bottom of the pan. Some of the chocolate chips stuck to the bottom of the pan I just stuck them back on the top of the cake lol. I made a simple glaze out of powdered sugar cinnamon and milk and it was a great addition. This cake is very moist and delicious although I don't know about calling it a \"chocolate\" cake it tastes more like a spice cake with a little chocolate in it. Either way the flavor and texture is great. Don't unmold while still warm!!! It will crumble and fall apart. This one is staying in my recipe box.",
