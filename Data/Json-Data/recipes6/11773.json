One year, when I was ten and we were pretty poor, this was the only gift we gave to those beyond our immediate family.  It was well appreciated by friends, teachers, and acquaintances.  We made different colors and flavors - Peppermint was pink; raspberry red; spearmint green; wintergreen blue; lemon yellow etc.  We placed them in small decorative jars and tied a ribbon around the neck of the jar.  Very fun!  It's been many years since we made this recipe.  Grandma says this one is an exact match with hers, except with hers you used 1 whole cup of Karo instead of 3/4 cup.",

Things I learned from them: 1)Remember - always use Cane Sugar - Beet sugar is a tiny bit different and doesn't harden the same way. 2) We put 1/2\" of confectioner's sugar onto luncheon trays made troughs with a dowel connected the troughs in a continuous line and poured the candy in an \"S\" in the troughs. When cool enough to handle cut and toss in more confectioners sugar.",

But it did take FOREVER to get the candy up to 220 degrees so I pulled up a chair and \"watched a pot boil\". I couldn't figure out how to cut the candy while it was still hot. But where I come from people pour the candy into a cookie sheet and smash it with a hammer so no one noticed. Be careful because between 250 and 300 degrees the sugar heats up very quickly. Also I had another recipe from the flavoring insert and it said to put the coloring in at 250 degrees and NOT with the flavoring. Other than that no alterations were made to this recipe.
