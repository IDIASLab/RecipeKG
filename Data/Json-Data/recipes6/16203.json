I always use a pizza cutter (the wheeled tool) to slice the dough strips.  3.) I got 12 huge rolls out of the recipe this way, using a 9 x 13\" pan.  Your quantity will vary depending on how thin you roll out the dough, how many strips/rolls you cut out of the dough, and what size pan you use.\r\n 4.)  The filling listed is not nearly enough to flavor all of this dough!  For the filling, I mixed together 1 cup white granulated sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, about 3 tablespoons of cinnamon, and some chopped nuts, and added that to the buttered dough, then rolled up the strips to form rolls.",

A few adjustments were...I used milk intsead of water and I put 2 tsp. vanilla in the egg/oil mixture.(it makes the dough a little more flavorful...less like plain bread.  I did these as a big rolled out \"sheet\" and smeared soft butter before my cinnamon/sugar.  I keep a tub of sugar/cinnamon/flour that I use for my cinnamon rolls and fruit pies.(1/2 C. brown sugar, 3/4 C. white sugar, 1/4 C. flour, and 4 TBS. cinnamon...the four helps keep your filling inside the cinn. rolls, and works to thicken the juice in your fruit pie)   These are also great if you spread diced apples on the dough before you roll it up...YUM!!",

I also drizzled on a confectioner sugar/milk topping when they were still warm. The dough can sit over night in the fridge in place of the 40 minutes if you wish.",

One thing might be to sprinkle crushed butter (or regular) pecans on top.
