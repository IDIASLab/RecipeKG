Bacon more cheese sour cream splash of sherry....something. The ease of prep was fabulous but it was just a 'meh' dinner experience for us.",

I made one slight change which was to replace the butter with bacon grease (okay maybe not the healthiest but it gave it a great flavor). My husband is a garlic lover so I added some minced garlic as well but I think it would have tasted fine without it too. Otherwise I followed the recipe as instructed and the soup turned out great I'll be doing this one again.",
