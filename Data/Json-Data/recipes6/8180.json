In addition to the ingredients listed, I added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms, a can of green chilis, an extra shake or two of red pepper sauce, and a can of hominy corn (Great al dente texture!). I also added two large pinches of sugar to help round out the flavor. Probably could have used 1-2 more cans of diced tomatoes for moisture. When I served it, I mixed in some pasta shells for variety, and I sprinkled sharp shredded cheddar cheese over the top. Absolutely delicious! If you consider yourself to be a chili aficionado, then you absolutely HAVE to try this recipe! Can't help but wonder what a little dry red wine would do for this recipe. Please let me know how it turns out if you try it.",

I did change a few things based on what I had on hand.  Instead of frozen corn,  I put in the frozen mixed vegetable.  Also, instead of black beans,  I substituted garbanzo beans.  My can of Bush pinto beans had jalapeno's mixed in it to add a little spice  Overall,  a true success.  I cut half the recipe for 6 servings, which really to me was like servings for 10.  My kids loved it.   We all went back for seconds.   Thanks to the cook who submitted this wonderful recipe.  I'll be making this again in the near future.",
