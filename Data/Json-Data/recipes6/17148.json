I read the reviews and added a TINY bit of extra flour like some people suggested. It was fine. As soon as I added the dry ingredients in it thickened and was perfectly normal dough. I just didn't let the butter melt while it was \"softening\" in the microwave and I stirred in everything as much as I could. The cookies are a little \"pancakey\" as someone else said but really still very good. My family loves them.",
