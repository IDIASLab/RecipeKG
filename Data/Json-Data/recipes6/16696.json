The taste may come of strong to others so what you can do is reduce amount of ginger or cut down on the molasses (maybe 3/4 cup?). If you decide to go on with the orginal recipe make sure you put a thick layer of marshmallow frosting so that the sweetness of the marshmallow cuts through the gingery taste of the cookie. Really good cookie!! Very soft and that marshmallow frosting is a nice touch!",

Nice cookies although I don't think a half hour is enough to chill this dough. I made the dough around 5:30 am and went to bake the cookies around 8 or 8:30 am and it was difficult to work with as cutouts so I ended up doing only a pan of cutouts and the rest as drop cookies which I smooshed with some sugar and the bottom of a glass. I then had hubs try to see if he felt they needed the frosting and he didn't think they needed it. I agree; they are sweet enough and if you like gingerbread cookies you will love these. They make a ton and my mixer was straining a bit with this mix. Thanks for the recipe!",
