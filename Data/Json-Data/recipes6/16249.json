                "reviewBody": "Excellent. A couple of minor flaws however. (Let's get that over with first then let's talk about how good these are) First the recipe calls for 4 egg yolks and 1 egg white. Since they're all beaten together it would make more sense to read \"1 egg and 3 egg yolks.\" Second unless perhaps you're using a mini muffin pan there's no way these would be done in 15 minutes - 22-25 min. is more like it. Check them at 20 min. if you must but be aware that if you check them too soon you risk them falling or caving in on you! Now for the good part. There are just so many ways you can describe a cake and after awhile it all sounds the same. Yes these are MOIST. Yes they are pleasantly SWEET as well as LIGHT and FLUFFY not heavy and dense as I saw them described unless you didn't beat the batter properly or are comparing them to a cake mix. Interestingly they taste kind of like a sugar cookie and they even have a crackly somewhat crispy top like one too. The almond flavor is noticeable but pleasantly so. But how to distinguish these from a million other cupcakes described the same way?... How 'bout this - I ate two of them hot right out of the oven. Knowing they're not at their best that way they have to be plenty darn good to eat a second one the same way! And tho' I vowed not to I had a third right after I frosted them (with a vanilla buttercream - take your pick from any of the wonderful recipes on this site). Now that's good.",

I saw Naples' review yesterday and decided I had to try these. I usually just stick with a boxed cake mix after trying a few scratch cake recipes that just didn't turn out. This one also calls for almond extract- my favorite flavor. The dough reminds me of a wetter Spritz cookie batter. And these are definitely light and almost sponge-like instead of dense. I was able to get 24 mini and 9 larger cupcakes out of this recipe with a little left in the bowl for me to lick clean. Will definitely use this recipe again and again. Thanks!",

My mom ate them plain for 3 days, the rest I frosted with a strawberry cream cheese frosting, topped with fresh strawberries. Still really good, just not the best yellow cake.",

The recipe was easy as cupcake recipes go and these didnt taste bad. The draw back is that the tops get hard and taste like sugar cookies and the center is chewy. Again they didnt taste bad at all its just the hard exterior and chewy interior. If you like that then you will like this recipe. For my purposes I am still on the hunt for the best vanilla cupcake that is moist throughout with great vanilla flavor. This wasnt it. If anyone has one please share!",
