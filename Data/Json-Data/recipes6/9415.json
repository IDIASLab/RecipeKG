I made the cheese sauce exactly as written, but with no thickening agent, the sauce was creamy,  but just runny. I added considerably more cheese (adding more fat and calories), but ended up adding a cornstarch slurry to thicken it a bit.  I found the Mexican cheese just too mellow, so in the future, I\u2019d change the cheese to 2 cups x-sharp Cheddar and 1 cup Mexican cheese, but that\u2019s personal taste. If I were to make this again, I\u2019d start by making a butter-flour roux, next add the half-and-half (but less of it) stirring until thickened, and then add the cheese.  The sauce definitely needs some salt and pepper, and I think a buttered breadcrumb topping might give it some nice eye appeal, as well as making it more like baked mac & cheese.  It tasted OK, but the texture is just wrong,  I know I\u2019m the first reviewer and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying, but this just didn\u2019t work for me.",

Substituted coconut cream from the pantry, added a healthy dab of Dijon mustard and plenty of ground pepper. The sauce melted beautifully.  Whatever survives tonight will be yummy for lunch tomorrow! \nIn future I will add a bread crumb topping to make it pretty and do the last baking step, but tonight we were hungry.
