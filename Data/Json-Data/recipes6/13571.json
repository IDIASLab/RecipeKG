                "reviewBody": "This is a great pie and only requires a few preparation \u201cmust dos\u201d go guarantee it turns out perfect. I think the texture of the sugar (or lack there of) is critical. As other reviewers noted, the pie may have a \u201cgrainy\u201d texture if regular sugar is used. You do not have to go out and purchase \u201cextra fine\u201d sugar if you have a food processor.  I put regular sugar in a food processor and let it go for 7-10 minutes and the result is perfect texture sugar. Check the sugar and process it longer if you detect any graininess at all. I agree that the butter and eggs should be at room temp before mixing. I disagree with some reviewers who cut down on the egg mixing time from the recommended 5 minutes per egg.  I believe the 5 minutes is an absolute minimum to obtain that smooth/fluffy texture. I would stretch it to 6 or 7 minutes if you have a hands free mixer. Also, NEVER make this without pasteurized eggs. Even though the chance of salmonella infection by using non-pasteurized eggs is slim, why take the chance?  You may not find pasteurized eggs in most \u201cchain\u201d groceries, but they can usually be found in specialty groceries. Finally, the first time I made this, I used a graham cracker pie crust. Sweet overkill?  Maybe, but you be the judge. Whipped cream is a must to cut the sweet taste a bit. Garnish with fresh mint leaf. UPDATE 12/23/10. I used extra fine sugar AND I put the sugar in a food processor for 2-3 minutes. Kitchen Aid free standing mixer for eggs @ 7 min. each. Perfect!",

The first time I made this pie, I beat each egg for almost 5 minutes.  I have made this many more times since then and have decreased the time to about 3 minutes with the same results. I didn't have the chocolate baking squares so to equal 4 (1 oz) squares, I mixed 12 Tbls of cocoa powder with 4 Tbls of vegetable oil.  Perfect! I used regular sugar but could see where \"superfine\" would be better.  I don't mind the little grittines it had because the taste made up for it.  I've never made a creamier or richer chocolate pie and I highly recommend this for those who have a passion for chocolate.  Will definitley make this again.   Many thanks Joan.",

The pie is very firm due to refrigeration but the texture is as smooth as silk and it melts in your mouth like a rich chocolate truffle. To avoid a granular texture you have to devote a little extra time. First you need to let the butter come to room temperature (the eggs too!). Be sure to whip the butter and sugar really well and then let it set for 5 10 minutes. This will give the sugar extra time to dissolve. Then whip a second time before adding the vanilla and warm melted chocolate. I used my KA and beat each egg as directed. I used a standard pie plate and the filling went all the way to the top of the crust making for a thick mouth watering piece of pie.",

I used standard granulated sugar and beat 8 minutes after the addition of each egg; there was no hint of graininess - I see no need to buy a special sugar or to process the sugar if one follows the original instructions on beating time. I would also alter the ingredients to specify 50% unsalted butter. A bit of salt accentuates chocolate flavors but there is too much in a full cup of salted butter. With a stronger chocolate and less salty flavor I think I'd happily rate it a '5'... but not as the recipe is now.",
