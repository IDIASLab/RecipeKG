                "reviewBody": "I turned it into a lower calorie version by:\nNot adding sugar to the cookie base, and used only 1 cup cookies rather than 2 c (plenty!). Used only 4 tbs butter. I used 1/2 pint of cream to melt the white chocolate in. With the other half pint I made topping of whipped cream dollops with just a touch of sugar and a dash of vanilla (don't need a topping but it looks pretty). I DID NOT add whipped cream to the mixture at all (totally unnecessary calories!). I also added only a 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Trulia rather than 1 cup sugar to the cream cheese mixture. Trulia does not have that \"diet\" after taste and it's much healthier for you. I used the low fat cream cheese and cut it down to 2 1/2 8 oz. packages instead of 3. The white chocolate and lime juice gives the flavor and the cream cheese is the  texture. You need to let it sit overnight for the rich texture to set in. I dare you to be able to tell this is a lower calories version. My family had no idea and said the texture and taste was like it was purchased from a bakery. I did not use any lime zest (didn't want the texture). It would have been pretty with mint leaves to decorate but since I didn't have any I added some colored dots instead only on the whip cream dollops, but added them all over on one slice just for a better photo presentation. (see photo above). This should be called a key lime cheesecake. It's probably the best I've ever tasted! \"Just the right tartness and not overly sweet\" is what my family said.",

I cannot begin to tell you the look on people's faces when they enjoy this dessert - I used it as a dessert special in the restaurant where I work and it's been going over amazingly well. People rave! I use a tad more cream to make it a little lighter. And the only comment I'd make is to chop up the zest if you end up with longer strings...it's unappealing otherwise. I also should say I stuck with graham cracker crumbs since some people have an aversion to gingersnaps (I personally love them and think they'd go perfectly with this recipe!)
