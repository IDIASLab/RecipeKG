She came to ask if I left off the salt as an ingredient when I typed it up so I came back to check. There is no salt in the ingredient list but it's mentioned in directions. I decided to check reviews to see if someone else caught it but saw the two disaster reviews instead. If the recipe is followed the cream cheese and condensed milk will set it. The liquid ingredients are used for the glaze not for the pie itself. Maybe that's the reason for the other cooks \"runny mess\".",
