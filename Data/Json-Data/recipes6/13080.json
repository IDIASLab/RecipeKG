I recommend baking them at a lower temp (160 degreesC) for 30mins for the first baking as this ensures the insides dry out thoroughly without the top browning too much. these were so delicious - i added a little more almond extract some chopped dried apricots and a handful of white chocolate chip and they were wonderful! next time i think i'll try forming the dough into three or four loaves to make smaller biscotti as two loaves makes each one quite big. this really is a great recipe.",

There're healthy and delicious and I can't make enough of them. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

Just put some parchment paper on your sheet and spoon it on in a three inch by however long section until you get as many of these as it takes. Kind of ice it into a biscotti shape. Bake it and then cut it and then bake it for about 8 more minutes. It is great!!!!",

Unfortunately I can't decide what exactly is bothering me about the flavor. I can say that it was very easy to prepare. One of my logs was ultimately bigger than the other and therefore I discovered while slicing it that the dough was still raw. I cooked those slices a bit longer than the others and they were absolutely fine in the end. I also like the consistancy of this biscotti. It's hard but not so hard that it's tearing up your palate. Next time I'll probably try it without the orange and with more almond extract. Anyhow happy baking! Update-I made this again but I replaced the almonds and orange with approx 3/4 c. coconut and 1 tsp of vanilla. I like them more than the first batch but I think I know the underlying problem now. The background tastes like egg. I'm going to search for a recipe with fewer eggs which is a shame because the consistancy of these are very nice - hard but once they're dipped they soften perfectly.

I baked on parchment paper but they spread out very much (side to side) and were only about 1 inch thick. Other biscotti turn out much taller and more of the shape I'm used to.
