While making the top layer I combined everything in a large bowl then used my immersion blender to 'whip' the batter to a smooth consistency elminating the 'gritty' texture of the ricotta. End result a nice smooth moist coffee cake type dessert. Absolutely perfect! I did double the lemon extract as per other reviewers saying it didn't taste lemony enough. Next time I will try it with butter in place of the shortening. I also used reduced fat ricotta.",

It browned in one spot in the middle of the pan and about an inch out all the way around the pan but the rest of it kinda remained uncooked looking. We tasted the parts around the edges that actually looked like it was the way it was suppose to be and it was ok. A little bland. I still have leftover blueberries so now I'm going to try my luck with a Blueberry Buckle recipe that I found on this site.
