                "reviewBody": "2.5.16 IMO there are some problems with this recipe. Step #2 simply doesn t make sense using biscuits. After 8 minutes @ 350 they were not even close to being done so the 8-minute recipe title even is misleading. Added another 2 minutes still not done so I bumped up the temperature to 375 for several more minutes. Maybe it would be 8 minutes @ 375?? You need much more than a pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon otherwise what you ll have are flavorless cinnamon rolls that taste just like a crescent roll. Finally I mixed 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar (not 3/4 cup) and still had quite a bit left over after drizzling the icing. On the positive side they are extremely easy to make pretty tasty and my 3-star rating is based solely on how they ended up after the changes I made. Really think the recipe should be revised for the benefit of anybody who d like to make these rolls in the future.",

However despite the low effort required to make them I felt kind of silly buying a can of crescent rolls which were sitting directly next to the canned cinnamon rolls. While these were good I don t feel they outshined the canned Pillsbury cinnamon rolls. Next time I will save myself the extra steps and just buy the canned cinnamon rolls if I want an easy breakfast. If I want more complex cinnamon rolls I will find a recipe in which the main ingredient is not a ready-made prepackaged item.",
