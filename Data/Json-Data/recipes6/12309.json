As taste goes, JUST because I'm me, I'd give these a \"4\" ... but to be fair, as Gingerbread goes these are the best I've ever tasted, and thus deserve a \"5\".\nInstead of Lard, I used Canola Oil.  Did the trick!  And I chose Fancy Molasses, as my other choice was Black Strap.  Fancy is less bitter, thus I knew would give the cookies a better taste.  They are not very \"spiced\" as some gingerbread ... may be why I like them (I usually find Gingerbread has to much spice for my liking).\nMy daughter is mad for them.  Trying to steal them before they;re even deocated.\nAs far as shape goes ... they cut well, they cook well, firm outside, soft inside ... nice cookie!  And they don't take forever to cool!  Definite bonus for decorating purposes!  ;)\nI forgot baking soda ... but they taste excellent anyway!  And didn't rise much, which actually help them keep their shape better compared to other cookies I've made!  I may always leave out the baking soda!  I really liked how they turned out!  \nGoing to make a great Christmas cookie!  Thank you so much!",

This will help to avoid \"headless gingerbread men\" as they are very easy to handle when cool. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",
