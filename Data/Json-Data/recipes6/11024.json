I did expect it to be a little moister but that will probably get better as I practice this recipe more. I also added shredded coconut and pecan halves to the bottom of each cake pan before pouring in the batter. That and the icing really made this cake! I took it in to work today and even though cakes aren't normally a big hit at my office this one was completely gone at the end of the day. All the guys were ready to propose to me! haha",
