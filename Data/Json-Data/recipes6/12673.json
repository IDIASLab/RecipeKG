Lucky for us because these are wonderful - nice and soft but with a bit of crunch. I did make a confectioner sugar icing and topped it with toasted coconut which the recipe does not call for but added so much. This is a great recipe especially if you are looking for something just a little different.",

Also the recipe calls for salt but doesn't say when to put it in. I added it with butter/oil step and I also added the vanilla at this step NOT at the end. The recipe says to stir in the oatmeal coconut cereal and flour. That seems kind of odd so I added the flour after the oil/butter etc was mixed NOT at the end. Then I stirred in the oatmeal coconut and cereal. My husband thinks I should add some white chocolate chips. Maybe.",
