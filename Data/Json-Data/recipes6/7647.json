A significant change I made was to use fat free cream. This made it much healthier but, believe me, the flavor was still outstanding.",

The bisque was so amazing that my husband (and I) are a little worried I may never be able to duplicate it? These are my additions: when I added the broth corn and bay leaf I also added a about half of a small jar of pimentos because I thought they would give a nice touch of color and I think many crab bisque's I ve eaten at restaurants have something red I wasn t sure if it was a red pepper or pimento but the pimento worked very well and was soft and tasty in the soup.. When I added the milk cream and liquid crab boil I also added three splashes of cooking sherry. By the way I had no idea what liquid crab and shrimp boil seasoning is. I searched the spice aisle of our best grocer and found superior touch better than bouillon lobster base and hoped for the best. This seemed to work quite well. I am not a Cajun cooker but a friend gave us Tony Chachare s More Spice seasoning as a gift and three shakes of this Cajun spice resulted in a bisque that was not spicy until after swallowing when a mild spice (I have young children) emerged. This was wonderful I hope I can re-create it!",

I was worried about the statement that it would taste salty so I didn't add additional salt (the recipe doesn't call for Old Bay seasoning so maybe that's where she went wrong). However it was not salty at all. I also didn't add the shrimp/crab boil because I didn't have any and didn't know where to get it. I used a can (6 oz) of lump crab meat and a 1/2 pound of fresh small shrimp (size 90-110). I followed everything else to the tee. Thank you!",

I will keep the recipe but I won't add the Old Bay or additional salt to the bisque. I did add finely diced carrots dried parsley (towards the end) ps: Old Bay brand crab and shrimp boil (liquid) was used. _____________ EDIT 5/9/16...tried it again...as I didn't see my first review (as I wasn't logged in) hehehe but saw other posts about salt\". This time...I added just shy of 2 tsps. of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and the Worchestershire but left out the additional salt and the Old Bay (frankly don't care for the taste anyway)....MUCH better!!!
