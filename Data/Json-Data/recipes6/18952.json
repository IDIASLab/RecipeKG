I didn't have any yogurt to use so I replaced it with sour cream and had to add a bit of milk because it was a tad too thick.  I used 1 whole egg in place of the 2 egg whites. I filled my muffin tins half full and topped each one off with a sugar crumb topping that follows:  Mix 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup flour, 2 tsp cinnamon and enough softened butter to form a crumbly mixture... about 5 TBLS.  Bake as directed.  Yummy!!",

I live in a very rural area with limited grocery selections.  (When I get out of town, I hit the super markets like other hit the mall.)  My local grocery did not have lemon yogurt, or rasberries.  They did have blueberry yogurt and frozen blueberries.  I made these 2 substitutions, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The muffins were awesome.  I loved the lemon/blueberry flavor.  I can't wait to try it with rasberries.",

The batter came together nicely -a little fluffy, and I did not overmix, just enough to combine. I filled 16 muffins tins about 2/3 full. I also took the option and sprinkled raw sugar cane on top of the muffins for decoration. The muffins were baked in 16 minutes flat. I like the light yellow color of muffins with red bits of raspberries peeking out as it is very eye appealing. I could see the sugar decorations on the round muffin top as well. And the muffins smelled lemon-y. The paper liner came off the muffins easily. The muffin itself is very moist, light and tasty. I was pleased it was not \"too\" tart and not \"too\" sweet - just right. I normally don't like super sweet desserts but in this case, the sugar works well with both the lemon and raspberries because it offsets the tartness with its' sweetness. Next time I may add just a little more lemon juice for that stronger lemony flavor (personal preference). A very light, fruity and refreshing muffin! This recipe leaves room to substitute the fruit for others like blueberries, strawberriee, etc.",
