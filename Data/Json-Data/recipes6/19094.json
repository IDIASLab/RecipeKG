I mostly followed the recipe but only cooked it for 45 min (1/2 batch) and added only 3/4 cup sugar. Then I strained the rhubarb pulp out. This left me with a beautiful pink colored liquid. The cubes were delicious in tea and great in lemonade as well!!! Thanks Stephanie great idea!!!",

Use a spoon to get it out of ice cube tray. Stays on the bottom of the glass and melts then there is all the rhubarb pulp. Better off putting the cooked rhubarb in a jar and freeze or refrigerate and use as a spread on toast or english muffin.",
