The honey and balsamic transform plain old brussels to a whole other level!",

I only roasted mine for about 7 minutes, flipped them, and roasted for another 7 minutes.   I added the honey and balsamic after roasting.   If you add the honey and balsamic before roasting, you'll want to reduce your oven temp and keep an eye on them or else they'll burn.",

The sweetness of the honey cooks off in the oven so don't be alarmed if the sauce tastes a little sweet.  The brittle little sprout leaves that fell off were so delicious that we were fighting over them before the end of the meal.  Next time i'm gonna add a little Parmesan cheese!  Thanks for the great recipe.",
