I tried them after 1 day and they were already delicious and addicting, but they got even better as the days went on. The spice-level was exactly how I like it. These make the perfect garnish for a Bloody Mary (or Caesar if you're Canadian!) I'm going to re-use the brine to make another batch, since the first batch disappeared so fast.",
