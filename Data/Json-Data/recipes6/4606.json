The recipe doesn't specify, but for color and interest I didn't peel them and added chopped fresh parsley at the end.  Don't be tempted to just boil the garlic along with the potatoes - you'll lose a lot of flavor!  I used the ground hazelnuts on half the filets, ground almonds on the other and Hubs and I agree the almonds were the clear winner. I love hazelnuts but in our view they're too sweet to coat fish with. I made my own fresh bread crumbs, seasoning them lightly with an Italian seasoning blend. I used grouper filets and brushed them with olive oil before coating them on both sides with the nut/bread crumb mixture. Because my filets were thin I didn't bother to finish cooking them in the oven - a few minutes in the skillet on both sides cooked them perfectly.  The browned butter was a nice touch, but we agreed we could have done without it. I don't think it makes that much a difference in taste and all that extra butter just wasn't necessary.  Omitting it would not diminish the dish and would save a lot of calories as well as an extra step in the preparation. I served this with fresh asparagus which was the perfect complement and made for a beautiful presentation.",

I did almost exactly what the recipe says except I used only about 4 tablespoons of butter and for the broth I dissolved a knorr's vegetable bullion cube and used about 4 tablespoons of that. I wish I had used more broth it was very tasty with the browned butter. The recipe calls for 2 halibut steaks I made 3 so I thought I would need to increase the nut/bread crumbs so I made 1/3 cup of each it was way too much the regular recipe is enough for at least 4 steaks. Overall it was an excellent dinner; and it was so easy and quick to make. I will definitely make it again.",

                "reviewBody": "This review was based on the fish only as I didn't make the potatoes as directed. I also omitted the browned butter as I felt it wasn't really necessary. That being said this fish recipe was excellent. I made this for hub's birthday after he came home with 30 lbs of halibut from an Alaskan fishing trip. I ended up cooking the fish in the pan completely rather than finishing in the oven - this is partly b/c I don't have an oven-safe skillet but also b/c I didn't feel it necessary. I served with another garlic mash recipe from this site steamed asparagus and the beet salad from this site. We both LOVED it. NOTE: The recipe as written will leave you with a lot of extra bread crumb/nut topping. I kept the leftovers in ziplock bag and made this again a week later with following variations: preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray (easy cleanup). After rinsing filets pat dry and sprinkle w/ salt. Lightly dredge in flour then dip filets in milk then pat into nut mixture. Place nut side up on cookie sheet and place a pat of butter on top of each filet. Bake for 8-15 mins depending on thickness (ours took about 15 mins as they are close to an inch thick). This version turned out excellent too but was a little easier. I still had left over topping and used again for chicken (in the oven) - yum!!! Overall - fantastic recipe that will become a staple in our house!",

I don't normally like using seasoned bread crumbs only b/c they're rarely seasoned to suit my taste. I switched in some panko bread crumbs (same quantity) and added in 1/2 tsp italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. My fillets were rather large and they wouldn't fit in my saute pan so I lightly greased a casserole dish and then brushed each fillet w/ unsalted butter. I sprinkled the seasoned breadcrumbs on top and baked it for the same time frame w/ the nut side facing up. Since I added garlic salt to the breading I chose not to add garlic to the mashed potatoes.

Instead of mashing the garlic separetly I boil them along with the potatoes and just mashed them together in my opinion the mashed potatoes are a little dry so I added about 1/3 of a cup of fat free half and half. Used tilapia instead of halibut but I'm sure it's a lot better with halibut next time I'll use that and also didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. Overall an excellent recipe that we will be having many times in the future.Thanks Jas Bradley for sumitting your recipe. Elvira S.",
