First you're already a step ahead given the inviting array of ingredients - oatmeal chocolate chips pecans coconut. I figured these were going to be rich and delicious provided the dough turned out well and it did. No wimpy sissy cookie this! This is a hearty chewy flavorful cookie with loads of contrasting textures. This is a perfect old-fashioned basic lunch-box or cookie jar favorite. One worth making whether you're \"spring cleaning\" or not. I made no changes other than using half-and half for the evaporated milk- the recipe (and cookie!) is darn good just as it stands although there's plenty of room for improvising to include whatever's in your pantry. Just a word of caution - watch baking time carefully! I made fairly good-sized cookies and they were done in 10 minutes.",

I did make a few ingredient changes: Instead of using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening I used 1 cup butter; instead of 2 TBSP evaporated milk I used 2 TBSP 2% milk; and lastly instead of using 2 cups all-purpose flour I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. As another reviewer suggested I baked for approximately 10 mins. They were 'too' yummy; it was hard to stop at one cookie. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I overcooked the first sheet full but I tasted one of those and they were pretty tasty even over-browned. A very good balance of flavors and very easy to make. It helps to have a stand mixer that you can throw everything into instead of breaking your arm mixing it all yourself. Great cookies Lisa!",
