I didn't prepare these lofat...just looking for a way to get rid of some sour cream(full fat). Also need to use up some applesauce. They did bake up nicely...6 Texas size muffins but for 35 minutes in my oven. I used a mixture of some blueberries and a banana. I tasted the batter but it still needed something so added some cinnamon to batter and a cinnamon sugar topping; which didn't make them sink. As an afterthought some vanilla would have been good. It can be tinkered with with spices if trying to make a lofat muffin but if 'going for the gusto'...there are better muffin recipes out there.",

Please be aware that I halved the recipe. Most baked goods require some extract so I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons of allspice and cinnamon. The texture resembled more of a cake than muffin but it was delicious either way. For those whose fruit sunk to the bottom. Toss the blueberries (or any fruit you choose) in flour prior to folding into batter. I will be making these again when I finally have blueberries on hand!",
