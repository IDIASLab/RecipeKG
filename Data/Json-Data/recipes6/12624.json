The basic brownie flavor brings comfort while the white chocolate and macadamia nuts add a unique twist so it's not just the same-old dessert. I would recommend this recipe when entertaining. As with all cookies bars and cakes it's better to leave them slightly undercooked than to overcook them. If you are concerned about overcooking try taking them out a bit early and covering the pan with foil while they cool.",
