It is great for a tea or brunch served with strawberry butter (strawberry jam butter and a dot of lemon juice mixed together). I left the pecans out this time to make it more \"kid friendly\" for my children who despise nuts. Also I used whole strawberries instead of sliced and tried to chop them up after I added them to the batter. Big problem there -- it also effected the baking so only used sliced or crushed strawberries.",
