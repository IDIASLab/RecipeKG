I would suggest that when you add the sugar, start with 1/4 c., add a little bit more sugar as you go along, tasting with each addition of more sugar. You can pretty much judge at that point how sweet you want it. I also added cinnamon. I also strained the apples before processing. There's nothing like fresh applesauce, thanks for this recipe!",

I added about 3 Tbs. brown sugar 1 tsp. vanilla a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Delicious!!!!",
