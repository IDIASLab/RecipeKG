UPDATE I just made these again using regular all-purpose flour (thought I had bread flour but didn't) which I sifted. I've never used bread improver because I can't find it in my area these STILL turned out wonderful. It's really hard to mess up this recipe!",

No one cared for them and didn't eat them.  They were heavy and overly sweet.  I decided to try them again since these got so many high ratings.  This time I made a bunch of changes and did a bit more digging into these rolls.  I switched out to All Purpose.  A much lighter and tender roll.  NO BREAD IMPROVER!  Bread improver is overly used by bakers who think that it \"improves\".  Truth is, you can't make an already bad bread better by using it.  I used whole milk, not canned.  1 egg, not two, 2 tsp of instant yeast.  I noticed in the first batch the strong egg and chemical smell was the first notes of the bread.  Used real, unsalted butter and Panko bread crumbs.  I think a good option might be a mixture of rice flour, yeast, a touch of sugar and water.. painted on the bread before the rise.  When it rises, it will crackle.. much like a dutch crunch vienna loaf.  The second batch came out much lighter, better and tastier.",

Apparently a sub is crushed vitamin c with a bit of water and it's to help proof the bread when you don't have time to do it. So...not really needed at all then! And these were fine without it. They are very soft and yes a tad bland but most pple eat rolls with butter or oil dip anyway so it's no big deal. I ended up with more rolls than stated since I'm not good at dividing up dough. The little ones were just as good though. thanks for the recipe!",

In my oven (two batches) 8 minutes was not enough 10 minutes was a tiny bit too much (but still divine). 2) I cut the dough as suggested by another reviewer. Easy and looked really spiffy. 3) 2 inches of unrisen dough I found made the pan de sal a bit bigger than you'd get in the Philippines. 4) size didn't really matter though as all rolls big and small turned out around the same time! 5) I used lightly salted breadcrumbs and in the dough a slightly heaping 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Not too salty I think just right. 6) Def no bread improver needed here so don't sweat that if you don't have it.",
