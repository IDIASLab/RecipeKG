I didn't put any chilis in, I didn't want it to be too spicy for my son. I did use 2 tablespoons of Sambal (Chili garlic paste) so I reduced the 10 garlic cloves to 8. Cooked for about 7 hours on low then cranked it up to high about 45 minutes before we ate. We topped it with green onions and sliced red chilies for my husband and I.
