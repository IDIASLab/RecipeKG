It's easy to make for those last minute cravings.  I used Cherry Berry frozen fruit blend (cherries, blueberries, strawberries). The flour can have a tendency to clump, so make sure you whisk constantly, or mix into a bit of water before adding.  A squeeze of lemon or orange would accent the flavors nicely.",
