But then I made it again a couple of days ago with the following changes: added about 2 teaspoons chopped garlic about 1/3 cup peanut butter and 2 tablespoons brown sugar and then divided it into two pans: with with less curry paste than the other. I then let it simmer for about half an hour while I cooked tofu and shrimp and then added one cut up cooked potato and about half a cup of peas. Prepared this way it was truly excellent and even better than the first time just like our favorite Thai restaurant. I'll try it sometime with zucchini which seems to be a common ingredient in curries at Thai restaurants.",

I checked the back of my bottle of curry paste before adding it and thank goodness... the bottle suggested 1/2 to 1 TBS (the recipe calls for two!). So I only added 3/4 TBS and it turned out PLENTY spicy! (The strength of the curry paste may depend on the brand.) Other variations: try adding 1 TBS brown sugar to the curry sauce. You might like to add some veggies while sauteeing the tofu; I suggest cauliflower (very small florets) and onion. You can also use seitan instead of tofu... turns out rather like a chicken curry. I like my sauce slightly thicker so I added a little cornstarch.",
