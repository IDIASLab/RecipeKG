That's not to detract anything from the original recipe, it's just catering to our personal tastes.  I doubled the recipe (3 lb pork butt) - it was very easy to dice the roast into smaller chunks by throwing into the freezer for a couple hours prior.  After doubling all the other ingredients I found it a bit bland so I *again* doubled the amount of spices (so 1/2 cup chili powder, etc).  Then I realized it was the perfect soup/stew to clean out the veggie drawer!  In went chopped carrots, my leftover lone zucchini, a couple stalks of celery.  About a half hour before it was done I threw in what was left in the orzo box - probably a cup or so.  I tell you what, I challenge you to find a more hearty meal than that.  So while I did stray from the exact recipe a little, we found something that is sure to be a family favorite for years to come!  Fantastic base recipe (the meat is to die for) that is wonderful to cater to your family's taste buds.  Sorry for the long-winded review.  ;)",
