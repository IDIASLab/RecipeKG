I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of \"ICBINB\" margarine and followed the rest of the recipe as is. Between the cup of shortening and cup of vegetable oil no need to grease the cookie sheets (allow them to cool for a minute for easier removal). For easy dropping on the cookie sheets I used a teaspoon size (probably slightly larger) cookie dough scoop which created nicely shaped even proportioned cookies. Please note that both times I made these the recipe made a lot more than the noted 4 dozen cookies so they are great for sharing and freezing as well as eating! Definitely a keeper!",

It took about 3 cups of whole cornflakes lightly rolled over a number of times with a rolling pin to make 1 cup of crushed cornflakes. I used a heaping soup-spoonful of dough pressed firmly which made 47 cookies each about 2 \" to 2 \" in diameter. I used a non-stick cookie sheet and there was no need to spray it first. 15 minutes baking time was fine with no burning. Sept 2017 update: I have made these a couple more times since my original post after noticing that the recipe states that it should make 24 pieces. I therefore use an ice cream scoop (size 16 in the culinary world?) and it produces 25-27 cookies. I up the baking time to 17 minutes and they still come out fine with no hint of burning. Let them cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes. They freeze well too.",
