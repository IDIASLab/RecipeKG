Also I am a Czech so I was intrigued that it was a Slovak recipe. Thanks so much to the poster for sharing it with us! It is absolutely amazing! I love both sauerkraut soups potato soups and mushroom soups. This soup combines two of them. I think next time I will try to add some potatoes - boiled separately;-). I used a real wild mushroom mixture - picked by my mom and dried by her. But I think I will be fine using a mixture of dried wild mushrooms which are now available in the supermarkets here in US. The dried plums/prunes - I was reluctant but they gave the soup an amazing slight hint of them in the final result. Smoked ham - I used a regular ham and added a bit of liquid smoke. Overall this soup was a hit! My husband now considers this my best recipe ever! It made a ton and it didn't really get old to us although we are only two people eating the whole batch.",

None of us thought it tasted too \"krauty.\" I used Andoullie sausage because I couldn't find Hungarian sausage. The mushrooms gave us a problem as they were gritty and we didn't rinse or soak them ahead of time which may just be a rookie error. This is definitely the start of a new tradition in our home.

I did not have Hungarian paprika or Hungarian dry sausage so I used Spanish smoked paprika and extra leftover sliced ham. I also used chicken broth instead of water. When I make it again I will not cook the ham for so long I might add more sauerkraut and prunes but there is no need to change anything else. I fully expect this to be a leftover favorite as well..",

I think spicy actually meant too \"paprilkay\" but who knows. Here is my opinion: Disgusting combination of sauerkraut and pork led to a greasy soup that was also very very - yes - sour. It was thoroughly unpleasant making a fair number of people sick. In the end a lot of wasted money on specialty ingredients. Would have been better off with borscht or something similar. Try it at a restaurant first.",
