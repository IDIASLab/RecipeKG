I did reduce the cloves to 1/4 tsp. so it wouldn't be too overpowering since it is such a strong spice. The ONLY thing wrong with this recipe in my opinion is that there is way too much sauce. You could easily get by with making only half a batch of the sauce. I ended up throwing a good portion away. My husband and I ate our first pieces with the sauce still warm and it was amazing. I then poured half of the sauce over the rest of the cake and my hubby took it into work the next day to share with his co-workers and it got rave reviews! I also choose to go \"natural\" and not add the food coloring to the sauce. The zest does give it a nice pale yellow color.",
