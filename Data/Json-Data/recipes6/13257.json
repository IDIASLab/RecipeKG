Everything came together as it should and the cooking directions couldn't have been more accurate. Unfortunately, this pie is only worth the picture one could take of it.   Weird texture, hard to describe, but somewhere between pudding and  brownies and failing at both.  While it looked like it would be chocolatey, it was not--in fact there was very little flavor at all, just simply like eating sugary mush. A major disappointment, as it looked so good we really were looking forward to our chocolate pie for dessert. ",

I think the mistake that user made was she didn\u2019t cook the mixture enough or stir it enough while it heated. I used granulated sugar and I heated my mixture before adding the egg. It was very smooth. I did make the mistake of not letting my chocolate mixture cool enough before adding the eggs though. So make sure your mixture is cool enough to add the egg. I went ahead and baked my pies though. With the strands of cooked egg throughout my chocolate mixture, but it still came out perfect! It was not runny and very smooth, and no one noticed any egg. I couldn\u2019t even find it myself. This is a very good chocolate pie. I will make it again =)",

If you read the instructions you see that you are NOT supposed to heat the mixture until after everything is all mixed together.  Some were talking about hardened pieces of egg, etc.  Do not add the eggs after heating.  Mix it all before and heat it all at the same time.  Then you will have this turn out as it should.",

To avoid spilling the pie filling while carrying the filled pie plate to the overn you can fill the pie plate after setting it in position on the oven rack. Also watch the meringue careful as when it starts to turn golden it happens quickly. Mine baked perfectly and set at 40 minutes. Try this recipe. You can't go wrong!",
