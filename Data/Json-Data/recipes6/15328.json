I used gluten free all purpose flour mixing sorghum and brown rice flour with potato starch and homemade almond marzipan and lemon zest instead of extract. I left out the food colouring. I shaped the dough into a square then refrigerated before cutting into shapes and baking. I have found that this helps the dough from flattening while baking. I dusted with powdered sugar before baking as well to keep with the Italian tradition. They were nice and they disappeared when the kids got home from school-always a good sign. Thank you Jandee for your recipe.",
