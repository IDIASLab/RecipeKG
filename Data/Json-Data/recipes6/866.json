The world didn't end!) I added celery, peas, carrots, sweet peppers, and asparagus - all chopped up super tiny. It was a lovely way to use a lot of leftover brown rice. This recipe seems so versatile and easy to expand (or contract).  Also- I used ground ginger- rather than fresh--- the result was a nicely spiced dish !",

This rice is sweeter than I normally make it given the teriyaki and added sugar. If I do this again those would be omitted/replaced with regular soy sauce.
