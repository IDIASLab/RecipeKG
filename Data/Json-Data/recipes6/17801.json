It gives the jam a slightly chewy consistency like cookies I get at the italian bakery. I like to make a couple of variations. I usually put a little of the almond extract in the cookies instead of in a glaze. Also for a more decadent cookie I also like to melt some semi-sweet chocolate and drizzle that on the cookies after they have cooled. The chocolate-raspberry flavor combination is delicious!",

I also skipped the icing and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the dough. I dusted the finished cookies with powdered sugar as did another reader making them look rather like old-fashioned Lindzer (sp?) cookies.",

I loved that I didn't have to refrigerate the dough and wait hours I could just mix it and roll it right away! Based on the other reviews I added the almond extract and it was perfect. I made the first batch into stars with the raspberry preserves but I am also going to make another batch and just decorate as a plain cut-out cookie. This is definitely a keeper!",
