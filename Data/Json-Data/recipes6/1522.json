I forgot to pick up peanuts so I used shaved almonds. They were good but I'm sure the peanuts will be even better. These took a lot longer to bake in our oven (close to 55 minutes) so be aware when you make these. THANKS for the recipe!",

I followed the recipe (with the exception of nuts...don't like them) and didn't have either of those problems.  They are slightly crumbly, but absolutely no one had a problem with eating it by hand - no need for a fork.  \nI'll totally be making these again.  The one problem - they are addictive!",
