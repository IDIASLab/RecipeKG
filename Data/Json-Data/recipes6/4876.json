This recipe is ridiculously bland. It desperately needs seasoning and acid. Kabocha squash is sweet. That needs more salt and acid to balance. I added a good bit of garlic, onion powder and salt. I also added some dried basil and rice vinegar. Add the vegetable stock sooner because water adds no flavor. Also if you aren\u2019t using the leaves of the leek then don\u2019t summer at first for an hour. Once I seasoned it, the flavor was good and I served with nice crispy bread.",
