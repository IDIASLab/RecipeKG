Followed the recipe to a T except I didn't have any chips left over to melt on top didn't need it anyway. And by the way 1 3/4 c chips was a 10 oz package. Watch your baking time since they're so thin they bake quickly. They're going to be a perfect addition to my Christmas baskets this year and years to come. Thanks for this recipe!",
