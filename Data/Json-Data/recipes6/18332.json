First of all don't use liquid pectin that is one of the problems with the recipe and it not setting. Second off don't use ball pectin use sure-jell pectin. I tried both this year to see which one worked best and the sure-jell cost 50 cents more but it's worth it. It started to jell before i could get it strained and into the jars. Which is a good thing The ball pectin did not set fully yet it's only been 4 days but the sure-jell set in 20 minutes. USE SURE-JELL not Ball Pectin!!! ",

I didn't change any proportions and otherwise followed the recipe to a \"t\". Turned out tasty and very pretty (the red bell peppers really helped keep the color nice and ruby) however I too had problems with the set and felt the vinegar was a little too prominent. My question here is what the heck was I supposed to do with the mint!? Although it appears in the list of ingredients the directions don't indicate what to do with it once you've got it. (I dropped a small sprig into each finished jar just for laughs but don't think that was the intent) Anyone?",
