Thanks for the canning jars idea!  My mom used to steam it in empty shortening cans, but shortening doesn't come in tin cans anymore and I'm not a coffee drinker!  I was at a loss as to what to steam it in since I don't have a steamed pudding mold.  I haven't had this in a long, long time.  I'll have to make it this year.
