I always use Hillshire Farms\u00ae Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (healthier), which is already cooked, in place of kielbasa, so I knew this wouldn\u2019t take 3-4 hours to cook.  I used my slow cook feature on my Instant Pot\u00ae with the normal setting, checked at 1 hour, and it was good-to-go, really just needed to heat up.  Bell pepper slices seemed like a natural with this recipe, so I did add some, and it just made more sense to me to use pineapple chunks rather than the rings.  The sauce did thin out, so I used the saute feature on the pot and added another cornstarch slurry to reach the consistency I was looking for.  Little on the sweet side for us (could just be personal taste), so I\u2019ll cut back the amount of brown sugar next time.  Nothing fancy here, we\u2019d call it comfort food in this house, and we enjoyed it.  Served with rice and a garnish of chopped cilantro for a pop of color.",
