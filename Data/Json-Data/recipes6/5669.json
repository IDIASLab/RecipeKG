I am first! :D This is an absolute EXCELLENT Vegetarian Chili option! with the inclusion of the quinoa, you do not miss the meat and it is SO healthy for you.  I made a couple changes, I used vegetable broth to cook my quinoa in as opposed to water (I always do and it lends a nice flavour to the quinoa), and used red quinoa as I prefer that over the plain.  I also used Ground Chipotle Chili Powder instead of regular chili powder as I love the smoky flavour it brings to the dish.  To make this even more healthy and to cut out as much sodium as possible, I used dried beans (re-hydrated) and instead of the canned/crushed tomatoes, I chopped up 4 large roma tomatoes, oops, one more, I left out the zucchini as I am not a fan of that vegetable. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly with all the other ingredients and it is spicy with the inclusion of the jalapeno and the chipotle, so adjust to your liking if you are not a fan of too much heat.  This does make a large pot worth, so I just divided it up into 2 cup portions and froze them, these will make great meals on the fly, just serve with some cornbread or a salad! Thanks Shauna for the great recipe! a clear winner here! :D",

The only thing I did differently was to add an extra can of tomato sauce because I wanted a saucier chili. This was my first attempt at cooking with quinoa, so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the texture of it in chili. But it was wonderful. It blended right in and added a heartiness to the dish. Great recipe! I will be making this again and again.",

I was rather reluctant as food texture is a big deal for me and I'm not a big fan of bell peppers. I'm so glad that we made this! Not only is the flavor excellent but the crunch of the bell peppers really added a lot to this dish. The quinoa was a different texture than I was expecting (I thought it would be more like couscous) and it turns out I really enjoyed it! This recipe is very filling and makes quite a bit so we were able to freeze several containers for future meals. Thanks! (Oh - and my husband LOVED the chili! He wants to make it again!)",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe takes a little getting used to as the quinoa adds a very different texture to the dish. I made this in an attempt to find vegetarian dishes that my family would eat. The flavors were good but the kids didn't like it. My husband just kept saying that it would be better with meat in it. Sadly as much as I prefer vegetarian dishes I'd have to agree with him on this one:( This will still be a standby recipe to use up food storage in the future.",
