After mixing the dough together I let it set in the fridge for a few hours before rolling it out and cuttting it. I didn't brush the biscuits with buttermilk but with melted butter during the last five minutes of baking. They come out light moist and fluffy. Plus they rise nice and high. Overall very good especially the next day with butter and jelly.",
