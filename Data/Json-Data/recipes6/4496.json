I'm giving it five stars based on how good it would be even without my changes!\n\nOmitted the mushrooms and carrots (didn't have any), chicken broth instead of veggie (what I had), probably doubled the cumin and used chili powder instead of the peppers (I'm a hot-spice wimp), and added a can of (well-drained) petite diced tomatoes.  I also halved the cheese -- 1/2 C mexican blend mixed in, then maybe 1/2 C on top -- to watch my middle!  (If anyone else tries with tomatoes, I made sure to spoon off the 1/2 C or so of liquid that they released.  It would have been soggy otherwise!)\n\nMy boyfriend LOVED IT, and I will make it again and again!  The best part is -- only $.60 a serving!!!",

I liked it a lot as well, but would probably change up a few things in the future.  First, it's called a brown rice casserole, but I didn't think there was nearly enough rice.  I'd double the rice amount in the future.  The carrot is also lost...not enough for flavor or even really color.  I'd either added far more or omit entirely in the future.  The swiss was good, but I think I'd like to try this with cheddar instead or in addition.  Lastly, I think the chicken could be easily omitted to make this a vegetarian meal if so desired.  This recipe is great as written, and I think it'll stand up to customization as well so I'm excited to try it again with my own spin.  Thanks!",

However,  I gave him a dish of it and he really thought it was good. Tip:  If you use canned black beans,  be sure to rinse them thoroughly - otherwise the sauce that the beans are in can \"discolor\" the casserole.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!",

We did however spice it up a tad bit more by adding 1/4 cup minced garlic, and using the shredded \"Mexican Four Cheese\" packs that virtually all cheese makers sell instead of using Swiss, plus we added extra cumin and cayenne pepper, and put sour cream on the servings.  Aside from the cheese, this is not only a filling meal, but healthy.",

I love the flavors I love the blending of such different ingredients...and when I first saw it I really thought it might be weird. The only part I didn't like was the prep work. I suppose if I used leftover chicken from another meal that would considerably shorten my prep time. But I tend to cook for EXACTLY who needs to eat with very little leftovers. And I really couldn't see there being 2 whole leftover breasts from any of our meals! I am actually pregnant right now & have been directed by my midwives to have some sort of hearty meal with plenty of protein & complex carbs (yay for brown rice!) ready to eat after I deliver. I am going to make this & freeze it. I wish there were MORE stars to rate with!! It is TRULY a fabulous blend of food groups & flavor!",
