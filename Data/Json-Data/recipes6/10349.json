I added the Rapid Rise yeast to all the dry ingredients except the cheese and pepperoni stirred it all together. Heated up the water and margarine to 120 and added it to the dry ingredients stirring together. Using my Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook attachment I kneaded the dough for a minute or two then add the cheese and about 1/3 cup chopped up pepperoni and kneaded another minute or two just until it formed a ball. I removed the dough hook and covered the mixing bowl with a towel and let it sit for 10 minutes. I greased a 1-1/2 quart casserole and placed the dough that I shaped into a ball in it and covered for 1 hour. I sprinkled the top with some of the cheese and baked it for 45 minutes at 350 then removed from dish to a wire rack. Using just a little more margarine I coated the top. Not only did it look beautiful it tasted great. This is a keeper...and so easy!",
