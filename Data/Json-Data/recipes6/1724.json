Not only did they not look like a popover but the texture was very heavy and dense very unlike a popover. Not sure what happened because I followed the recipe to the letter didn't change a thing or substitute anything. And even if the appearance and the texture had been good they simply needed more pumpkin flavor. Sam Nemati sorry for the unfavorable review I had high hopes but these pumpkin popovers were a huge disappointment.",

I followed the revised instructions by Sam to cook at 450 degrees F for 20 but then I only cooked at about 10 minutes at 350 F after that because they seemed to be about done. I didn't have custard tins or large muffin tins so my popovers are a bit on the small side but they have that great eggy taste mixed with pumpkin. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used two dashes cinnamon 1 dash nutmeg 1 dash cloves and 1 dash ginger. These ended up being the perfect on-the-go breakfast. Thanks Sam!",
