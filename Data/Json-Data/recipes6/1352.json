To form the truffles, I used my tablespoon size cookie scoop.  I used mini-chocolate chips inside the truffles. Instead of using confectionery chocolate, I melted 1/2 cup of regular chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon of shortening in the microwave and dipped the frozen truffles. I sprinkled almonds and red and pink candy Valentine hearts over the tops of the truffles before the coating hardened.  Thank you, white_angel for sharing your delicious recipe!",

I used a wooden spoon and hand mixed and it was pretty difficult to mix in the flour. I had to use my hands to mix at the end and so I left out the last 1/4 cup of flour just because I was getting tired of mixing. They weren't too sticky when I rolled them into balls. I froze as stated and they were very easy to dip; I used chocolate almond bark. DS thought they needed a tad more salt to taste like real cookie dough. I made some 2 inch balls and some 1 inch; I prefer the 1 inch as they are very sweet and I like the smaller bites. Made for Recipe Group selection.",

Doing that did make these a little bit stickier to roll but they worked fine. Very easy to make and I really liked the little tang from the cream cheese. My little taste testers loved them! I'm not usually a huge fan of cookie dough things but I really enjoyed these and will def be making them again! Thanks for sharing:)",
