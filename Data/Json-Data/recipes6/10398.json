The pale pink color inside is lovely as well. I scaled down the sugar to about 1 cup (and used raw) and I used a combo of alternate grains (cornmeal rice flour buckwheat etc.)to substitute part of the whole wheat flour for variety. To add moisture and reduce fat I substituted applesauce for part of the vegetable oil. Adding a pinch of ginger spices it up nicely too. It's so good that I'm baking it for the teachers at my kids' school for their special luncheon. Thank you!!",
