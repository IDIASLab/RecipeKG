UNFLAVORED GELATIN to improve the set-up. Eureka! This was the perfect firmness and kept its shape in a mold. Flavorwise this is mildly flavored not overly sweet or tangy and has a bit of fizz sensation. The cream cheese does stay slightly chunky (even though I mixed it with the CRUSHED pineapple in my Kitchenaid) but is fine. I was extremely skeptical of adding nuts but feel they added greatly to the flavor and texture. Last tip: BE CERTAIN that the gelatin is COMPLETELY dissolved in the hot water-- you should not hear or see ANY grains or it will not set up. To speed set-up I did put this in my freezer for one hour and then refrigerated another two. It worked perfectly. The End:)",
