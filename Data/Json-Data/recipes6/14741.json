                "reviewBody": "STICKY FINGERS!!! This recipe makes a good cookie. They are easy to make but cutting up the orange slice candy is tedious and sticky but not difficult. I cut the regular sugar to 1/2 cup since the candy and the coconut add sweetness and sugar already. One trick that worked well for me was having the bowl of sifted dry ingredients handy when I cut up the orange candy. I dropped the cut candy into the flour mixture which prevented them from clumping when I mixed the batter. I dipped my fingertips in the flour and that helped to keep the candy from clinging to my fingers. I also added the coconut to the flour mix and tossed it all together before adding to the sugar/egg mixture. It's nice to have a cookie recipe on hand that doesn't have nuts since so many people are allergic to them these days. I like nuts myself and think that chopped macadamias would be good in these for some crunch and another hint of the tropics.",

My husband loves orange slices so I had to try it.  I'm so glad I did he LOVED them. I did use orange extract as others suggested, but forgot the zest and the coconut, it didn't matter because the orange slices gave it just the right flavor. I also took the suggestions of cutting the candies in sugar and tried flour.  The flour worked the best. After eating a few I started to think these might be really good with Spiced Gum Drops too.  And they are!!!  So I'm off to make my third batch in a week!!! Thank you so much for this recipe.",

I cut the orange slices up into raisin size pieces & then noticed that they wre sticking together (due to the unsugared parts after they were cut) so I sprinkled sugar on them & gave them a toss working the clumps apart. Tedious but worth it. These have great texture for an oatmeal cookie. I will use the base recipe & try other additives besides the orange slices. Not that they weren't very good but there is a lot of candies out there I don't want to play favorites. LOL Thansk for a wonderful cookie recipe Louise!",

I made half of these exactly as written and while they were delicious they were not as 'puffy' as I like my cookies to be so I added a bit more flour (about 1/2 cup) and the second half were perfection. Great tip by the way about sprinkling the cut up orange slices w/ sugar to keep them from sticking together. Next time I may add some macadamia nuts to these to give them even more of a tropical flavor. Great post!",

Maybe I didn't cut my orange slices up as small as they should have been because the orange bits sat there like lumps and biting into them inside the cookie kind of clamped my jaws together.",
