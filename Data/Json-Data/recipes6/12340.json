The ingredient list calls for one quarter cup milk yet the direction is for you to beat the egg in a cup measure and add milk to the one quarter cup line. That ended up being much less than a quarter cup of milk. The other criticism is that there is no time given for baking. We baked the cookies about until golden brown (25 minutes) and they came out too hard and dry. Not a bad cookie but I wouldn't go to the trouble again with the kneading and cutting.",
