I made it for my peanut-butter lover sons and they couldn't stop talking about it--AMAZING was the word I kept hearing.  I wanted to take a picture of it for the website but it was gone too quickly!!\nOne tip--when the recipe says \"chill\" on the crust, put it in the freezer for about an hour.  That makes it much easier to put the ice cream/peanut butter mixture in it.",
