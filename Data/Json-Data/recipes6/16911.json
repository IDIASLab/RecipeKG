It was very simple to make and didn't require added yeast as many others here do.  \r\nThe first time we used it, it wasn't quite right, but we've been using it for about 3 months since then with excellent resuts.  Its got a good flavor and the dough always rises without any help from store-bought yeast.\r\nThe starter itself is low maintenance and was completely unphased when I forgot to feed it for 4 weeks.",
