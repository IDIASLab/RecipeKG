This recipe says to use a MINI muffin tin. It says to open 12 mini peanut butter cups to put into the baked cookies. The amount of dough this recipe makes completely fills 24 mini muffin cups BEFORE baking. Of course I went ahead and filled the 24 cups thinking maybe just maybe the 12 PB cups were suppsed to be 24. Then after they'd been baking I started opening those cups. What did I see? a nearly identical recipe on the back of the Reese's bag. The only difference? Vanilla. Well vanilla AND the fact that the recipe (with identical amounts of flour fat PB and sugar) says it makes 40 cookies not 12. The baked cookies puffed over the tops of the mini muffin cups because they were so full to begin with. Wanna make these? Use TWO 24-cup mini muffin tins. Open 40 mini PB cups. Roll the dough into 40 balls and follow the recipe directions for other amounts.",
