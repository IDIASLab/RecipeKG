For the reviewers who may be unsure of what to do with the sauce and meat:\r\n1) Fry a pita in a small amount of oil to soften it (I just put mine in the microwave for a few seconds ~ it's just to make the pita pliable to wrap around the fillings), fry the donair meat in same pan to warm it, and then fold the pita around the donair meat, sauce and chopped tomatoes and onions for toppings. (I've also had them with mozzarella cheese melted in them ~ mmmmmmmmm).\r\n2) Meat and sauce make great oven-baked subs (same topping suggestions).\r\n3) Donair Pizzas ~ sauce, meat and whatever toppings strike your fancy, mozzarella cheese.\r\n4) The famous Donair Plate: fries topped with meat, sauce, chopped tomatoes, chopped onions, mozzarella cheese and baked in the oven. (I  order mine without the fries ~ personal preference).\r\nI can't believe donairs haven't really caught out outside eastern Canada ~ these are big business at the pizza shops here....I order donairs way more often than pizza ~ my 13-year-old has been an addict since he was old enough to pick off my plate. :-) Oh, and pizza corner rocks for donairs.",

The trick to the meat is to ask your butcher to put it through the meat grinder 2 more times to grind it extra fine. Medium beef also works the best. Also, absolutely no substitutes can be made for the sauce. You must used evaporated milk and you must chill the sauce before using. The cold sauce meets warm spicy beef is an important part of the experience. a warm pita is important too.",

I am vegetarian so I use veggie ground round for mine and just add the spices to it instead (without salt).  my hubby makes the meat version and it's turned out every time.  The sauce is also delicious and anyone who says otherwise is not making it right...it takes some technique...this is how we do it: -must use full fat evaporated milk -mix in sugar and garlic completely until sugar is no longer granular -begin whisking the mixture to get liquid moving and pour in 1/4 c of vinegar AT ONCE -ONLY STIR 3 or 4 more times and let the chemical reaction occur and the mixture thickens (on its own)...this is key!! The sauce turns out perfectly this way...so we recommend following the steps exactly if you want the same great results that we get! ***also make sure to wet the pita under the tap and sear it on a hot pan so that the pita is moist and pliable for adding the donair ingredients!",

So I desided to make them and home using this recipe and everything turned out wonderful. I now make 10lbs of beef at a time and freeze it in little ziplocks for individual servings and for friends who have moved here and miss the tastes of home. Again the sauce is perfect as long as you remember to blend the ingredient WELL before adding the vinager. We wrap ours in a steamed pita bread and top it with the sliced beef that we fry after it has been frozen or cooled and then add on diced tomatoes onions lettus and mozza cheese. We then wrap it in wax paper and foil and put it in a plastic bag like they do at the donair shops so it isn't that messy when we eat it. I hope that everyone else has as much success with this recipe as I did....enjoy!",

The important thing they left out of the recipe is how to eat it! after looking around the net First we tried it on fried pita breads. which was delicious but was messy and fried. so we then tried it with just dry pitas and opened them like pockets. with the meat and the sauce and tomato and onion. would be good with lettuce or cucumber too. would also be good on a premade pizza crust like boboli and the sauce and tomatos onions and cucumbers. Fabulous meal for something that sounds so gross. I will make this again and again. plus since the meat is so simular to meatloaf recipes... maybe ill try just making the sauce for that leftover night.",

The meat in this recipe is perfectly spiced and the sauce tastes perfect as well. You are a real donair expert!:)",

I found the meat to be dry first off. I tried to have an open mind about a milk-sugar-garlic-vinegar sauce (Oklahomans like their milk gravy but this mixture is TOTALLY unexpected..) I guess it's culture shock. Not something I'll make again.",
