In the morning I whisked the eggs and sour cream poured it over the potato mixture arranged the bacon on top and shredded the Velvetta. Cooked it and served for a holiday brunch along with a different breakfast casserole for variety. Everyone liked it a lot the only complaint was as it cooled the Velvetta had a slightly rubbery texture. If I had used shredded cheese that may not have happened and it was a very minor complaint. I have been asked to make it since and I think \"most\" people will really like it. I loved making this and the other casserole ahead so I had time to visit while they cooked.",
