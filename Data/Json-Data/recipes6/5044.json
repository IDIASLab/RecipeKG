I had never made a curry with tomatoes and cauliflower in it before, but the Hunt's Diced Tomatoes and the fresh cauliflower really made the dish amazing. My husband is already talking about making it again. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I do however recommend letting the lentils simmer longer at least another ten minutes before adding the coconut milk, carrots, and cauliflower. Because I followed the recipe exactly our lentils were on the crunchy side after cooking for the suggested time. We continued to cook it until the lentils had softened unfortunately the veggies were a little softer then we would have wanted. Even with slightly soft veggies it was still very tasty. It definitely had a small kick of heat, I might leave out the serrano seeds next time I make it.  I highly recommend this recipe.",

For our eating preferences this made 8 servings not 6. Loved the spicy flavors so much that I ate it with just a piece of pita on the side. Everyone else had it over rice but not necessary at all. The cauliflower came out perfectly cooked as did the lentils. Turns out red lentils are different and we love them.",

I didn t brown the cauliflower in advance as I didn t want it to be too soft - it was cooked perfectly. I added the juice from the tomatoes as I didn t see that till after the fact as a few others mentioned... but think the added juice helped in cooking the lentils fully. Used Jalape\u00f1os as I couldn't find the Serrano peppers. Also used only 3/4 of the coconut milk. This was a great dish and will make it again for sure!",
