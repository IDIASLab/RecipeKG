Ginger is the traditional spice and this hits the right note. A fabulous way to serve is to pour them out on the oiled baking sheet and when cool enough to handle form into a pyramid and place on a cake stand. Let guests break off bits of these sweet nutty-crunchy dough balls. I have taught this recipe to my high school students.",
