I used tart wild black berries and it was still a little on the sweet side, I would probably decrease the sugar by a 1/4 c.",

With family stretched across 5 southern states cobbler is a tradition, and this recipe certainly rates as good as, if not better than, most family recipes (don't tell Grandma).  Both me and my dad agree that this is a superb recipe.  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp. of freshly ground cinnamon to the dough, and another 1/4 tsp. to the fruit mix, and also a little extra lemon juice.  Nothing that would really change it.  Also, my new rangetop doesn't allow cast iron skillets :(  No big deal.  I boiled the fruit mixture in a large sauce pan and transfered to a casserole dish (uncovered) while still bubbling, and then added dough.  Voila!!  I don't think I'll ever need another cobbler recipe.  When the blackberries run out I think I'll try it with apricots.\n\nEdit:  I've since increased the dough mixture by 50% and reduced the sugar in the fruit mixture by half (with other member recommendations).  Much better!",

I doubled the topping recipe and added 1 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter. I used frozen raspberries and they worked perfectly. I used the amount of sugar the recipe calls for and the sweetness was on-point. When I tossed the berries with sugar I also added the zest of one orange and squeezed a little into the boiling berry mixture. I sprinkled a little more cinnamon and some coarse sugar on the batter after dropping it into the berries and used a toothpick to check doneness. ",

This year I decided to try this recipe and we just loved it! My husband especially thought it far surpassed the other recipe I have used. He liked the fact that it was made in a cast iron skillet. The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar. I used 1/3c in the batter and 2/3c in the berries. Also I use raw (turbinado)sugar. I think less sugar lets you taste the berries more. Thanks for a great recipe, it will be the one I use from now on!",
