I used frozen and alot of juice came along with the peaches. After they're thawed you may want to add some sugar mine we're very sweet. Each of my bags were 10 oz and I used two bags which gave me the equivalence of 3 cups so I used what another reviewer suggested and I added a cup of blueberries a very nice touch! Substituted almond extract for vanilla. The next time I make this pie I will add the brown sugar to the pie the last couple minutes of baking because the pie wasn't in the broiler for even a minute and the sugar started burning. Super easy pie to make my boys helped and loved the filling before we added it to the pie thanks for sharing this recipe!",
