I added about 1/2 cup of diced red onion one large clove of garlic finely minced and about 1/2 tsp. dried marjoram with the quinoa and vegetable broth. I added the chopped broccoli during the last 5-7 minutes of the cooking so it didn't overcook. I had some raw cheddar curds that I grated and added at the end. Be sure to thoroughly rinse your quinoa before cooking to eliminate the bitterness. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!",

My husband who is not the biggest quinoa fan I know said I could \"make this as a side any time.\" Don't forget to rinse the quinoa first to remove the bitterness. I also had to cook the quinoa a bit longer and took the advice of some other reviewers and added the broccoli after 10 minutes of cooking. Also just added a tiny pinch of salt because I used a vegetable bouillon cube with water as a substitute for prepared vegetable broth. Definitely will be making this one again and again!",

I served it with red pepper flakes, which was great, but next time I'll probably throw some cayenne in when I add the broth.",
