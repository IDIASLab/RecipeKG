The pastry turned out great although I had to triple the icing to cover the top as in my local towns pastry shop in UK I sprinkled coloured suger on the top of the icing. The custard was very thick when I popped it into the refrigerator I left it there for 2 hours before serving did I leave it in too long? The custard was sooo runny very disappointing. I will be looking for a new Vanilla Slice recipe to try and compare.",
