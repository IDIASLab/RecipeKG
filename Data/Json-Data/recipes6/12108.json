                "reviewBody": "This recipe is the closest on this site to the official Nanaimo City recipe (which I later found). The only major differences are: Almonds in the original recipe rather than walnuts. Also try using a total of 1/2 cup butter in the custard layer and use heavy cream in place of the milk. On personal preference I also use an extra square of chocolate in the top layer just so I know it will cover the whole pan. While I'm not a Canadian I am a native Northwesterner and my dad was a truck driver and we often rode the ferry to Nanaimo (to deliver boats) when I was kid. These are served on the ferries. It's really too bad that this is such an obscure recipe outside the Northwest becuase if people knew about it it would quickly become one of their favorite desserts. As for custard powder here is what I've found on accident. The Bird's Custard powder is in a yellow red and blue box. I hear it's easy to find in Canada but not so easy to find here in the US. I was shopping at some Asian stores in my area and low and behold there was the Bird's Custard Powder. Although I've used vanilla pudding I have to say it's worth a trip to some International markets to try and find the stuff. You can also find it in large grocery stores that carry lots of specialty and organic items (even though it's not organic). Rosauers carries it here in WA it's in a yellow/blue/red can in the baking aisle. You won't be disappointed. My mother and law also told me she has found",

Once the chocolate on top is hardened, take it out of the refridgerator and let stand 30-60 minutes before cutting into squares.  This softenes the chocolate just enough so it won't crack under the pressure of the knife. Chill after. Also if you want to make to impress, double the custard icing and add a drizzle of white chocolate(melt 1/2 cup white chocolate chips with 1 tablespoon butter/margarine) on top while chocolate is still warm.",

I made the crust and regretted putting in the full 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, it made it very dry and crumbly, not at all the consistency needed for a crust. The egg should have been whisked lightly before adding to the melted butter and chocolate (off heat) so that it didn't get all \"eggy\" or scrambled into the mixture. So, although Nanaimo bars are DELICIOUS, the ratios are off and the directions need tweaking in order to make them delicious. Sorry!",

I also use 1-1/3 cup of butter in the crust, with 2 cups graham crumbs and 1/2 cup crushed walnuts in a 8x8 pan.  Slowly add the crumbs to chocolate mixture to make for easy blending, and this gives a nice thick crust.  The directions should tell you to mix the milk and the pudding mix prior to adding it to the butter (a key step) for the frosting.  I personally make 50% more frosting.  The crust also works well with pecans and almonds... NO coconut thank you!!",
