Half-way through I realized I didn't have enough vanilla extract so for the bottom I used 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. imitation maple flavor and for the bottom I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 imitation maple flavor. After it was done baking I took some mini milk chocolate chips and microwaved them until they were melted and used that as a topping. It's delicious!",
