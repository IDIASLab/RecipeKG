Oh, I also couldn't find pastry flour, so I just use whole wheat flour for all of it. And I always use a different flavor of fat free yogurt instead of plain.  Also I mix the pecans right into the mix, and bake for about 17 minutes.  Perfection!  These are so low in fat & calories and totally moist.  I recommend them to everyone.  Great recipe!",

To reduce the sugar I skipped the raisins and maple syrup and instead used just 1/4 cup sugar as called for in the recipe and 4 bananas.  They were not bakery-cakey sweet that way, which I actually prefer.  Non-fat greek strained yogurt worked terrific (and added to the moistness--plus a protein boost!), and if you do that, you don't need sour cream - just use 3/4 cup greek yogurt for both.  In my laziness I also used one whole egg instead of the 2 tsp egg whites.   Don't skip the nuts on top!  I had walnuts on hand so used those. Makes them very pretty and appetizing.  I've tried dozens of healthy banana muffin recipes over the years but this one is a keeper!",
