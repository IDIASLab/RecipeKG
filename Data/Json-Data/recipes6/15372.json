However I made the following changes so that I wouldn't have to deal with the batter being too runny: Mix together with a beater 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup butter 1/3 cup milk 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1 egg. Then add 1 3/4 cups flour 1/2 tsp baking soda 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt. Fold in chocolate chips at the end. This makes it so that the recipe is really a drop cookie recipe. The flavors actually do blend well together ( I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first). Thanks for the idea!",
