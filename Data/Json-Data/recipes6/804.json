However I thought there was way too much butter. Perhaps the submitter meant 3/4 stick and not 3/4 cup. I followed the recipe not using the optional walnuts. Mine took 22 minutes until they were brown and pulling away from the pan. I thought they would set up more after cooling but they were still stickier than I expected. I would be willing to try this again but with a major reduction in the butter or an increase in flour. A change like that may make these turn out better.",

It wouldn't be a bad idea to sprinkle the top with a little kosher or sea salt to really make it pop. I also think this recipe is best served with some ice cream and maybe a little drizzle of caramel. This would even make a good \"small treats\" recipe for those of you who like Wilton's cake decorating for small treats. I plan to top these brownies with my homemade Irish cream or whiskey buttercream icing.",
