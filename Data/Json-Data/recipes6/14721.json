One thing the recipe doesn't mention is that to form stiff peaks in the whipping cream you need to also add sugar to that (about 2 Tblsp).  This also makes the recipe sweeter - We serve the whipping cream on the side so each person can make it as sweet as they like.",

The only changes I had to make was doubling the egg yolks( I agree with other reviewers without this it isn't eggy enough like eggnog should be). I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the eggnog itself because it was alittle too plain for how we like our eggnog. I didn't add in the rum but kept it as an option on the side so the kids could enjoy it also. With the changes I made it came out thick and oh so yummy. Everyone at our Christmas loved it. I also made this the night before due to time constraints the next day and it kept perfectly.",
