I only used about 4 or 5 cooked them in an 8x8 casserole dish completely covered with the cranberry sauce for an all over marinade--perfect. The extra sauce is excellent over top of rice as well. Also I used \"My Grandmothers French Dressing\" recipe from this site so glad I did--mmmm. Lastly use fresh chicken breasts it'll turn out better or at least it did out of the two times I've made this:) Thanks for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe!",

This mix gets poured over boneless skinless chicken breasts in a pan covered with foil and refirigerated overnight. The next night take it out uncover and cook for 45-60mins in a 350 degre oven.

But after the dish was done cooking, everything tasted wonderful!  I was worried that the kids wouldn't eat it because of the onion soup - but they loved it. My niece thought it was the plum sauce we ate at the Chinese restaraunt a couple days ago (which she loves). I will definitely make this again. It was too easy and too good not to.",
