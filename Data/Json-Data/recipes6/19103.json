Makes it much easier to mix everything, and it comes out more consistently. I would add at least five cups of fruit, because there is a lot of topping. I used frozen fruit; I just let it sit on the counter for half an hour, and it was still kind of frozen when I put it in the over. A little bit wet (due to it being frozen fruit I think), but absolutely delicious and fool proof.",

It surpasses the feeling you get when a sudden cool breeze rushes past you during a four-day heat wave.  It will make financial account managers take their shoes off and throw them in a dumpster. Quite simply, if everyone in the world had but one bite of this Triple Berry Crisp on the same day at exactly the same time, everyone on Earth would suddenly, magically, find they spoke the same language.  All barriers would collapse. Wars would cease.  And perhaps best of all, Hallmark Cards would instantly go out of business because we'd no longer need to rely on someone else to help us express our love for each other.  I kid you not.

There just wasn't enough berry flavor under all the flour and oats. Next time, I will leave out the nutmeg, even at a half teaspoon it overpowered the crisp (my nutmeg was very fresh).
