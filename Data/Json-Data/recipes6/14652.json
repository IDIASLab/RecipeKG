To my surprise, Mom informed me the other night that the recipe needs only HALF OF A CAN OF EVAPORATED MILK!!!  Apparently, you all seem to get good results with a whole can, and I have, too, but try it next time with half a can for a denser texture.  If you double the recipe, make sure to use only ONE CAN!!!!

I am a vegetarian and substituted the eggs with Egg Replacer and it still came out perfectly. I also experimented with a variation on this recipe. Instead of using evaporated milk I used an 8 oz block of light cream cheese. To make the cream cheese easier to blend in I used just enough evaporated milk to make it a bit more fluid, about a 1/4 cup. This substitution made for a denser pie, but the \"crust\" was more evident and it tasted like a pumpkin cheesecake. It was one of my better experiments.",

Also following suggestions made by others I did use the entire 12 oz can of evaporated milk (rather than half) pumpkin pie spice for all the others and threw it all together in the blender and blended for 1 minute.

I had no problem baking this in an 8\" springform pan and the whole thing keeping its shape when inverted.

Next time, I will use the full can & see which is best for us. I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie mix for the other spices. After it cooked, my first thought was, \"Dang! They were right... it is much more like  cake than a pie.\" But that was in appearance only. The \"crust\" (don't expect much...it is really only a thin cakey layer) forms on the top but underneath, it is very much like pumpkin pie filling. Hubby & I both preferred it over a traditional pumpkin pie w/ crust. Served it w/ a dollop of whipped cream. Thanks Betsy!",
