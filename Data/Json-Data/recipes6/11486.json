I don't like wasting anything and remembered that my mother used to make sour milk cake all the time. Only thing, I didn't have her recipe, and she passed quite some time ago. I prayed I would be able to find it in one my favorite places to go when I need a recipe. And, yeppers, there it was. I just love this recipe. Only thing I did didfferent was add more chocolate since that's my favorite food. And yes, I do use lard, cuz it makes it soooooooooo yummy. Just like mom's. Thank you again for posting this recipe, you're truelly heaven sent. :-)",

It tastes okay but it's nothing special. Bf did seem to like it. I had a container of store bought chocolate chip fudge icing so I put some on while the cake was still warm so it would melt over it. It added some sweetness and flavor. I also used a bundt pan instead of a square pan. This seems very similar to the Sour Milk Spice Cake on here which I may also try since I still have sour milk left. Thanks for the recipe!",
