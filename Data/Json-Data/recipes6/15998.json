I also added a little bit of dried orange zest to the dough. The only thing that I had a negative comment on was that the cookies came out slightly dry. The texture was great but my husband commented that he needed milk after eating a couple of them. I used my new battery operated cookie press that the dough was sooooo easy to work with! I was so excited after many failed attempts with a cookie press. Definitely a keeper and I'd appreciate if any other reviewer would comment on what I can do to help with the dryness. Thanks!",
