I altered the recipe a bit: Add (1) bay leaf, 1/2 C. chicken stock,(2) carrots, (2) celery, (2) potatoes, dash of oregano, and 1/2 canelli beans (optional).  Words of advice:  Sautee onions, carrots, celery, and garlic together.  And add the potatoes and the beans in the last 1/2 hour so they don't get too mushy. I like this dish served over white rice.

So with that in mind, cook today and SERVE tomorrow.  Crusty bread and white wine round out this hearty stew.",
