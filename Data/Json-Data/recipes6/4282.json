I used what I had on hand, so I had normal plain Greek yogurt (not fat-free), cheddar and pepperjack cheese, bacon (not prosciutto), spiral Bonza noodles (chickpea noodles), and I accidentally put too much cumin, and I added French's crispy onions and a shredded parmesan blend on top. \n\nWith all this said, the texture was a little grainy. The flavor was pretty good. The overwhelming cumin was not my favorite, but that is not the recipe's fault. The spicy level was perfect. The spincah was unnoticeable. It needed some salt. I probably won't make this again, but it was a good way to use up my yogurt!",
