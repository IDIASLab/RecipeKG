This recipe has so much promise but will need to be tweaked to arrive at a meal that doesn't turn into Lentil Porridge. I been using my Instant Pot for years now but never prepared a lentil dish in it. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the end result was a disappointment. With setting the time at 15 minutes and then allowing for the natural release caused the carrots, celery, and especially the lentil to completely disintegrate. The flavor was fantastic however, my husband & I were so disappointed in the final result. I will be keeping this recipe but next time, I will do a quick release after 10 minutes. Hopefully, that will allow the textures to remain intact.",
