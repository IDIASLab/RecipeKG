Flavor is good \u2013 I used fresh thyme (the equivalent in fresh is three times that of dried) and added some celery just because I generally do. I didn\u2019t bother cooking the vegetables first just because I generally don\u2019t.  There is minimal filler and I appreciated that.  I like the brown, crusty exterior on meatloaf so I shaped this as one loaf on a cookie sheet and baked it for 1-1/2 hours.  I did not use the brown sugar glaze as the sugar did not appeal to me so I served this with a simple brown mushroom gravy.  As this recipe\u2019s first reviewer I\u2019m happy to report that while there is much wiggle-room with this recipe to make it \u201cyour own,\u201d this basic, old-fashioned meatloaf is good  just as it stands.",

It is still the best meatloaf I have ever eaten and the finished product, if you follow the recipe for the glaze and baking time, does NOT look like the main photo shown above. It is much more pleasing to the eye. When I made my meatloaf this last week, I jazzed it up just a bit by substituting Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage for the pork and added a couple dashes hot sauce to the topping before stirring it together and spreading on top. It took this A+ recipe up to the next level. A++ I guess! \nP.S. I have tried to post my photo to this site and it always says, \n\"Not enough pixels\". My iPhone just doesn't do the trick. Guess I'm better in the kitchen than behind the camera?",

I never use loaf pans when I make meatloaf. Instead, I shape the meatloaf recipe on top of a foil lined jelly roll sheet. A 3 pound meatloaf with recipe ingredients approximates: 2\" high x 5\" wide x 10\" long. Pour the sauce/glaze on top of this Bigfoot meatloaf, roll up the sides of the foil a bit to hold in the sauce and pop it into your oven. Thank you for this great recipe, Leigh Ann. We thoroughly enjoyed it here in Texas!!",
