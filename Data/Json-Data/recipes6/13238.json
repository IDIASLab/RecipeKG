If you didn't like it, here's probably what went wrong- yes, the butter should be reduced by 2-3 tablespoons.  To keep the crust white/ golden brown, sprinkle the cinnamon on top of the peaches- putting it in the batter will make it too dark.  Finally, this recipe is best with FRESH peaches; canned peaches are so saturated with syrup and other stuff that they don't soak up the butter.  Additional juices/ syrup makes everything runny and the crust mushy, so if you have to used canned peaches, drain them really really well.",
