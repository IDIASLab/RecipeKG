That's when I started thinking that 1/4 cup liquid didn't seem like very much for a cake.  Since I had not forgotten anything and the other reviews were so good I baked it anyway, but was very disappointed in the results.

I made the recipe as directed but my egg white for the macaroon would not get stiff. So I tried again thinking the plastic bowl was the issue. Even in the glass bowl no success. So I added the coconut flour and vanilla and moved on. It turned out fine. Just not enough of it for our tastes. The chocolate cake itself was AWESOME! So chocolatey and moist (yes I added 3/4 cup water instead as suggested). I also ended up with an extra egg yolk so I threw it in there too. Didn't seem to hurt it at all. After all aren't recipes as much a suggestion as an absolute? Anyway overall this cake is a keeper! I will make it again and again. BTW - I used the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site for my glaze...FANTASTIC! You really should give a go. So easy and so yummy!",
