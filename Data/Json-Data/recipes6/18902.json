Then just chop up the tough outer segments into 1-2 inch pieces and throw them in you can pick them out before serving. Here are my changes but the recipe as written is certainly not bland and it IS advertised as a mild curry so it's understood that if you want a spicier dish kick it up a notch! My additions: I added 1-2 cups of organic pumpkin but it could be any winter squash. This is a great boost to the color & nutrition of the dish. I increased the cashews to 1/2 cup and added 1 more garlic clove. I used agave instead of sugar and sauteed the potato & pumpkin first in the oil curry powder & spice blend. Maybe 10 minutes to bring out the flavor and partially cook the veggies. Then I added everything else but I cut the coconut milk down to 1/2 can (not my favorite)and increased the water. I also added 1/2 an organic apple diced at this point (I used Fuji but it could be any red apple) for a little sweet and balance. Don't leave out the water! This is the most important part! Your curry needs liquid in which to simmer! I even topped off the water a few times making sure to keep the veggies covered until fully cooked. I also added the juice of a fresh squeezed lime at the end to round out the flavors. Yum!",

Actual stalks of lemon grass are not meant to be eaten. I've heard there is a lemon-grass paste available in some grocery stores so maybe that would work. Otherwise chop your grass into approx 10cm segments and add to the mix so it can be removed more easily. Also cut the water out completely. Adding a cup of water totally drowns out any flavour at all. If you like a thinner curry MAYBE add a bit more milk/coconut milk if you so desire. update I did find lemon grass chopped finely enough to actually eat in an Asian supermarket in Missasagua (one of the suburbs of Toronto Canada). Unfortunately it's really hard to find and even the biggest Asian markets don't seem to always carry it. You might find such a thing amongst the spices. Good luck!",
