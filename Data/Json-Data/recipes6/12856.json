The traditional recipe takes LARD and eggs (or just yolks... they're even better if u add a cup of wine). i tried to make this recipe just for a change and it was a huge disappointment. First of all the shortening ruins their flavor. If you try to make them from lard you'll find out how softer and flavorful it makes the dough giving them a special touch their distinctive sign. Actually that's why these are called \"MANTECADOS\" because their main ingredient is \"manteca\" (lard). I didn't like the anise flavor (better with cinnamon or vanilla extract). Another reviewer said their texture is very close to cookie dough and that's wrong i guess he/she was talking about \"mazap\u00e1n\" (another traditional christmas dessert here in Spain very thick). There are also a kind of little cakes called \"mantecadas\" not as crumbly as \"mantecados\" like a type of muffins but made out of lard or fat. In any case I think i'll keep making my old recipe will not make this again!!!",
