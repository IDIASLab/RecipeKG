I had a fresh orange on hand, so I zested it and added, and it made a difference (I love orange peel), but it would have still be great without it, as another user said.  I did cut down the vinegar to 2TBsp as recommended by most.  (I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup).  I was not sure which apples to use, so I asked someone, and they recommended MacIntosh (they break down better)...worked well.  Amazing recipe!  I loved it!  This will be my standard cranberry sauce from now on.  Thank you very much!!!  Those who did not try it because they dont like cranberries have no idea what they are missing!",

I substitued craisins for raisins, and used two whole cinnamon sticks, 10 whole cloves, a nub of fresh ginger and a sprinkle of cayenne for heat. I also reduced the vinegar just slightly, but don't think that is necessary. Once the chutney sits and the flavors meld, the vinegar flavor really mellows out. I'm making another huge batch of this for Christmas gifts today!",

I had to make a second batch to eat with the leftovers, it was so good.  I made it the night before, and it was very sharp tasting, when it was fresh, and still warm.  I was worried that it would be too tart, but a night in the fridge mellowed it perfectly.  Made it a bunch of times since, it's great just to eat off the spoon.  Thanks for a new classic recipe in my house, I highly recommend this one.\n\n***THREE YEARS LATER- We still use this as our traditional cranberry sauce on holidays, and throughout the year, and we still LOVE IT!!",

The only thing different is that I simmer for much longer than 10 minutes. It's more like 20 minutes and then I turn the heat off and mash it all together with a potato masher. It is heavenly! I just finished my Thanksgiving day batch just now. I may cheat and make a cold cut turkey sandwich just so that I can savor the warm sauce! Tomorrow it will be served at room temperature for all to enjoy. Cheers",
