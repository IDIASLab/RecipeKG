A Pannu Kakku recipe that I saw on another site said it was an \"oven pancake \" so I was expecting something similar to a pancake. (Which this was not). It was more like a slight sweet puffy egg custard. My husband liked this and I didn't care for it very much (though that may be more my personal taste than the recipe). I had to bake it a little longer than stated. I am glad I tried it if only for the experience of baking (and tasting) some Finnish food.",
