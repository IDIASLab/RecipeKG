I cut in 2 tbsp cold butter with the streusel ingredient which made a beautiful and thick topping. \n\nThe Mott's in this recipe was a really nice flavor add and I think with the changes its a 4-5 star recipe.

I used a combination of Tuscan and Orange/Cranberry bread. Both breads are dense so I allowed them to sit in the mixture for about 5 minutes to absorb the liquid mixture before baking. I do recommend adding some butter to the streusel topping because it was too dry and chewy for my liking.",

For the topping, I added almond flour and butter as well as nutmeg.  To take this over the top, we baked it in an iron skillet that had been prepared with melted butter.",

                "reviewBody": "Of the couple of times I did make bread pudding I remember it being dense and very sweet. This recipe is the opposite. I suppose the apple sauce takes the place of some of the fat and sugar in the classic recipes for bread pudding. I followed the recipe for the most part but I did add a splash of vanilla and dash of salt to the egg mixture. Even sweets usually have a pinch of salt. I used a walnut raisin bread I made in my bread machine. The walnuts were actually a nice addition. The topping also didn't come together like I know crumble toppings to do so so I ended up kneading in 2 tablespoons of softened whipped butter. That definitely helped. I was wondering why the main picture didn't show the topping unless it was optional. I ended up filling 6 oiled ramekins with 2 #16 scoops of filling and 2 tablespoons each of the topping. It divided perfectly. When done I liked it best slightly warmed with a little whipped topping. I think vanilla ice cream would be a nice compliment also.",
