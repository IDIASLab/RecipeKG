I actually cut all ingredients in half but still spread in 9 X 13 pan because I wanted thinner bars to use for fondue dipping. They were the perfect thickness even just for snacking so would make it this way again. I used a few different kinds of cereal on hand (Cheerios Golden Grahams and Rice Crispies.) I lined bottom of pan with was paper sprayed some pam around edges came out with ease! Yum! Thanks for an easy recipe that utilized ingredients I had on hand!",
