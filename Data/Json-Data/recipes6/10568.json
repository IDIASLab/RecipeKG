                "reviewBody": "I have to wonder if people leaving negative reviews expected boiled pretzels.  The leathery, really chewy taste of pretzels is usually because the pretzels have been boiled before baking.  It is essentially the same process for bagels as it is for pretzels:  boil water and baking soda, and boil the pretzel for approximately 30 sec-1 min in the boiling water, then transfer to a baking sheet and bake as directed.  That will get you the chewiness a lot of us expect from pretzels.  These are a decent, basic pretzel that are so easy bc they are made in the bread machine.  You could also make these in the Kitchen Aid mixer as well.  I like the slicing part of this recipe--I didn't even bother rolling the slices and they baked up beautifully.  I didn't want to do an egg wash, so I used water and then broiled for about a minute to get a darker crust.  These are pretzels you want to serve with mustard or butter for dipping--as written, they are a bit bland.  Thanks for the recipe!",
