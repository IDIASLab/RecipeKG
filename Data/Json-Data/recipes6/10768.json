My cakes have always ended up resembling something of the Leaning Tower of Piza or a crater in the moon - just ridiculously deformed and extremely creative \"works of art\" that all the icing and frosting in the world could never make level. I hate to sound like an infomercial but until I found this recipe I thought I was doomed to cookie baking for the rest of my life. This recipe was extremely easy and after reading the reviews I made a note to use only 3/4 c. of sugar since I was using a package of already sweetened coconut. And to avoid any of the grittiness that some of my fellow bakers experienced I made sure to use extra fine granulated sugar (try C&H's Baker's Sugar)- it should melt right in. To ensure that the icing wouldn't be runny I made sure not to overblend the filling and whipped cream and refrigerated the mixture for about half an hour while the cake was cooling. After everything was assembled the result was something actually visually stimulating and although I did an awesomely bad job at splitting the layers the filling does a wonderful job at concealing this fact since the color of the filling blends in with the cake. For once I ended up with a masterpiece that raked in so many compliments it inflated my ego. Thanks Kathy!",

Use this milk as part of the liquid in the cake. To open the coconut hit it with a hammer to crack it. Clean and wash fresh coconut and grate. You can use a food processor to grate the coconut quickly. Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the coconut in the cake batter. I used lemon curd (lemon pie filling) between the cake layers. I only used two layers. This can be purchased canned with the pie fillings or you can make your own. For the frosting I only used half a 8 oz. container of whipped topping 1/2 cup sour cream and sugar to taste -- about 1/2 cup. I added about 1 cup of the shredded coconut to the frosting mixture. Toast some coconut to put on top of cake. Freeze leftover coconut in small zip-lock bag for a future project. This is an easy recipe compared to my usual coconut cake and it got rave reviews.
