It is very similar to the \"Mexican chocolate cake\" on this site, except for the stovetop work. This cake is awesome and moist and delicious! My grandmother's recipe also included a pour-over frosting: melt 1 stick margarine with 6 tablespoons of milk and about 1/4 cup cocoa in a saucepan until it boils, then remove from heat. Beat in powdered sugar (about 4 cups, but I never measure) and 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Pour over warm cake. YUM!",

I usually add a bit of instant coffee to most chocolate cakes/brownies I make and I did to this one too - about 1-1/2 tsp. Really does a lot to intensify the chocolate flavor. Iced with a cocoa/butter flavor crisco icing and was really really good. I make a similar cake that calls for two sticks of butter - obviously that one is a bit more decadent.

I halved the recipe used margarine instead of butter and at least doubled the cocoa powder. I also added about a cup of mini chocolate chips and I'm glad I did because the cake itself didn't have a very strong chocolate taste to it. It took about 40 minutes to bake in a 8x8\" glass pan. I melted together about 1/4 cup butter 1/3 cup chocolate chips vanilla and 1/3 cup milk to make a frosting and after I pulled the cake out of the oven I poked holes in the top and spread the frosting over. I served it piping hot to an impromtu group of people and it recieved wonderful reviews; someone even said it was the best chocolate cake they'd ever had. I think a lot of the wonder of the cake was in the fact that it was warm which really wins desserts a lot of points for most people.",
