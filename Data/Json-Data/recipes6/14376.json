My mother has been trying various recipes for years trying to recreate it but it hasn't gone so well. I offered to try this year and used this recipe. Success! This was it! Based on several reviews I lowered the alcohol slightly (by about 1/4) and I didn't find it overwhelming. I think the full amount would have been fine. As it was with mine there was just a hint of alcohol. I am knocking off a star for the pre-made pie crust part of the recipe. That is unthinkable. Those things taste like dirt. Crush 24 Oreos 6 Tablespoons melted butter bake at 350 F for 10 minutes. Easy.",
