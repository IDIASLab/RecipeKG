A lot of people prefer a carrot cake with cream cheese icing, but at least try this one with the glaze. The glaze, in my opinion, is what really makes this carrot cake stand out from other carrot cakes. It's absolutely amazing! Every time I make this cake it is a huge hit. I have been asked for my recipe countless times. I also love carrot cake with cream cheese icing and did try it on my cake once. It was good, but not nearly as good as it is with the glaze.

Then as so many others have done I reduced the oil in half and added that amount of applesauce  instead. I also use l tsp cinnamon and l tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It sparks it up nicely. In our family it is called the dangerous carrot cake because it is so good it is a danger to all resolve to modration.",

As I was making this I realized my can of pineapple was 20 oz, so I just used it.  As far as texture, you could not ask for a more \"moist\" cake.  The changes I will make next time is add some raisins and a little more spice, just as that is a personal preferance.  I did not use the glaze.. we like cream cheese frosting.  I use 1 stick butter, 2 cream cheese, 2 cups of powder sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla for my frosting.  Thanks! UPDATE:: I just took a piece out of fridge this morning.. ok the spice sets in this totally rocks the second day even more!!  I just changed from 4 to 5 stars. ",
