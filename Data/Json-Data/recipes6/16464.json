Two changes I recommend - (1)skip melting the caramels, I use the Smuckers caramel ice cream topping, and (2)reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.  I use a 4 cup measuring cup, put all ingredients in (except pecans), and mix.  Once mixed, stir in pecans and pour into crust.  I use a convection oven, and my bake time is about 45 minutes.  Once the entire pie jiggles as one I remove and cool.  Absolutely delicious!  ",

I also took 6 caramels, a dash of milk and a pat of butter, microwaved about 30 seconds, stirred until smooth, and drizzled over the tops of the baked pies for a caramel topping.

Five to seven minutes over low heat is not long.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, may cut it a little more the next time.  The amount of filling was perfect for the 9 inch shallow pie crust--just handle carefully, and put a round pizza pan in the oven while preheating, and place the pie on the pan.  My friends and family raved about the pie.  I am 73 years old, an accomplished cook and baker, and will definitely make this again for special occassions.  Thanks Corwynn for sharing this recipe with us.  Chef Gordon.",

I made a cream cheese/shortbread crust:  beat 6 ounces softened cream cheese, 1 cup softened butter, 2 cups flour, 3 teaspoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Chill the dough for 30 minutes and then shape 1 tablespoon of dough into a ball, flatten and press into a mini muffin pan.  (My muffin pan is silicone.)  Fill the cups with 1 tablespoon of the caramel/pecan mixture.  I had enough leftover filling to fill 6 more cups, so you may want to decrease it a bit.  Bake at 325 for 40-45 minutes or until crust is very light brown.  Makes 36 tartlets.",

The only downside to it is the unwrapping all the caramels and cost of the nuts. I always use Kraft brand caramels though I have tried using cheaper ones a couple of times. I did not get as good a result so I would recommend only using the Kraft. Also I add slightly more pecans than the recipe calls for.",
