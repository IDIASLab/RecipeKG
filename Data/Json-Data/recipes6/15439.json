This salad was not as spicy as the one I was trying to achieve and far too sweet, however it was much better when I cut the sugar in half and added some diced thai peppers to the marinade.  I like it served over rice instead of lettuce.  One thing about the recipe was misleading and that is the time involved.  The recipe talks about preparation and cooking time but fails to mention the three hours needed to marinate the steak.  Unfortunately, I just glanced over the recipe the first time I made it and didn't allow enough time.  I really think that if a recipe requires time to marinate that should be in the heading area with preparation and cooking time.",

I think it makes a big difference to use the very best cut of meat you can afford. I used 1-inch shell steak pan-seared about 4 minutes each side. It's even better the next day after it's marinated for a while.  It's good as a salad or over rice (I chopped the vegetables extra small). I used more chili sauce and less fish sauce than the recipe. If you've never had fish sauce before, I really recommend that you start with just a little because it's quite strong.  I'm thinking about making this with tofu intead of steak next time.",

                "reviewBody": "I haven't tried this recipe exactly, as it is so close to the one that I use that they may have come from the same source.  The only difference is the addition of minced garlic to the sauce, and instead of sugar and sweet chili sauce, I use Splenda and ground chili paste.  \nI also like to marinate the meat before cooking for extra oomph.  I just use a bit of the liquid portion of the sauce and discard that after removing the meat.\nHere is a helpful hint about lemongrass - if you slice it very thinly and only use the tender white part, it makes a crunchy edible part of the salad.  I shudder to think about chomping on a one inch piece of lemongrass!\nAnother hint that this recipe includes is adjusting the flavor of the sauce.  When using fresh ingredients (lime, cilantro, etc.) there may be an extreme variance in flavors from one time to the next.  It is critical (IMHO) to taste the sauce and correct any imbalance before continuing.\nThis dish always receives rave reviews except from my quirky sister-in-law who doesn't like 'cold' meat.  I actually reheat some of the meat and sauce for her and she will eat it beside the salad.\nHighly suggested for anyone with an adventurous palate!",

I got mine from a Thai chef when I used to work in a 5-star hotel in Malaysia which have 5 restaurants, including a Thai. Almost all is the same except that mine has minced garlic, does not use mint leaves and replaces lemongrass with finely chopped ginger and white with brown sugar. You may of course experiment which works best for your taste. I always put a lot of cilantro, because that gives me the uummmm! They name it 'koriander' here, by the way.\n\nI always make this when friends and family come for the first time to our home here in the Netherlands, and I receive good comments EVERYTIME! They are most of the time surprised by the exotic combination of spices, expecially those who are not familiar with cilantro. Not everyone likes cilantro but luckily it combines very well in this concoction of flavors. They always request for it the next time they come. Thanks again!",
