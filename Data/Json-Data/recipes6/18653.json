My tip: do NOT generously butter every single layer, or it'll end up dripping butter -- not the ideal baklava.  I'll try spray butter next, or every 2 layers. Mmm!",

Just in case you don't have unsalted butter or almonds as I didn't no one noticed that I used salted butter and walnuts which I normaly do. My one son and husband couldn't get enough of it.
