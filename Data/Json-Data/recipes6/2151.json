I used homemade coconut milk and Uncle Ben's Basmati Rice (didn't have the Jasmine on hand). It cooks up exactly as stated. Where it says to use a non-stick bowl maker it's true.:-( I ended up with pieces of wonton wrapper stuck to the bowl. I used homemade gluten free wonton wrappers so this may have created issues. No one cared everyone gobbled it up and asked for seconds. It is also a very attractive dish. I went heavy handed on the red curry paste adding an extra tsp or two and then spiced things up by adding some fresh hot peppers. Thank you bd.weld for your recipe.",
