While the seasoning on the tilapia wasn't my favorite, it wasn't terrible. It's the avocado salsa verde that wasn't very good. As written, it was very bland - it definitely needed some salt to bring out the flavors. The salsa verde was good after I added the salt, but the longer it sat, it became incredibly bitter. Of course I didn't notice that until I had put all the tacos together. I'm not sure what could have gone wrong with it, but it just wasn't enjoyable.   I was able to scrape  most of it off, and ended up serving the tacos with a different sauce. I suggest you use fresh cilantro instead of dried.",
