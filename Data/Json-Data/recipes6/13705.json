The first time I made it, I used a food processor on the fresh cranberries and there was a lot of tart juice, which I didn't really like.  Now I freeze the berries first, then cut them into quarters.  It takes a lot longer, but it tastes sweeter, I think, because the juice isn't mixed into the yogurt.  Fabulous recipe!",
