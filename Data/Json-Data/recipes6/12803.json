To say \"it never did reach  hard ball stage\" is a ridiculous statement.  As with any taffy-type candy, it takes a while, but of course it will eventually reach that stage.  I made the popcorn balls this afternoon and they turned out great.  The only thing I may do differently next time is to take the candy to crack stage so it is a bit more brittle  (personal preference).  Thanks for this good old fashioned recipe, Lynne.",

I think those who tried this recipe and did not wait long enough for the sugar mixture to turn to hardball stage, just did not wait long enough. It did take quite some time to get to that point over a medium/low fire but it did reach the hardball stage. The end result was WONDERFUL and the mixture did not \"sugar\" after it had set for a few hours...they were perfect and tasted wonderful, just like Grandma's.\r\nThank you Lynne for posting this recipe.",
