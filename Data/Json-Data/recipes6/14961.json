I used 1 can reg broth and 1 1/2 cans of low sodium broth, cut up the carrots and added 1 celery stalk, chopped.  Also, right before the chicken was cooked through, I added 1/3 cup noodles.  By the time I was finished cutting up the chicken, the noodles were done too. The result was a thick soup that was pretty tasty. Sprinkled dry parsley overall. Thanks Deb.",

I also added a cup of frozen green beans at the end to give it some color. It was amazingly easy totally hit the spot and Dan loved it. Highly recommended!",

It wasn't the best chicken soup I ever had but I suppose that type of soup takes hours of slaving away in the kitchen. I also used fresh chopped celery instead of celery salt and a boullion cube base. We had some leftover pre-cooked spaghetti noodles from the dinner before which we added in the last 5 minutes and it made a nice addition. We had leftovers the next day and I actually thought it tasted better the second day after the flavors had more time to release. The vegetables/chicken/noodles had absorbed some of the soup so we added a little more boullion base and it was really delicious the second day!",
