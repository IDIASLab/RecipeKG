The sherry is necessary to provide the acid to activate the baking soda and to add liquid to make the steam that raises the bread so if you don't want to use it sub with apple juice concentrate or orange juice or strong Earl Grey tea that will do the same things the sherry does. You may want to sub powdered ginger or allspice for part of the cloves since for some so much clove may be a bit overpowering. The walnut oil is wonderful but the less expensive sunflower seed oil or peanut oil is almost as good.",

The only thing I changed was that I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand other than that this recipe is perfect. The walnut oil really gives it a wonderful flavor. I would not try to substitute it unless you want to use a different nut oil like pecan or hazelnut. I'm not a fan of sipping cream sherry (my mother told me it used to be her favorite drink over ice) but if you sip it while eating a slice of this bread the flavors just burst in your mouth - this bread is incredible!!",

I use raisins instead of nuts and my favorite trick is to soak the raisins in the sherry for at least 20 min before mixing up the recipe. I recently had to substitute some applesauce for part of the oil when I ran out and found it was just as good as ever... will probably do that from now on to cut down on the oil. (1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.) Thanks for this yummy recipe!!",

Used 2 cups chopped toasted walnuts (we love nuts) would be good with pecans or toasted pumpkin seeds too. Soaked 1/2c craisins in the sherry warmed in microwave for one minute to help absorb. Used half butter half oil little shy on the oil. Went half cup less on each sugar measurement. Add the eggs to the creamed mixture before adding pumpkin as with all baked goods. Baked 6 mini loaves (40min) and one dozen mini bundt (30 min). Perfectly baked no goopiness. I have never had good success baking full size loaves with most quick breads so I don't! Would have made 10 mini loaves without the bundts. I filled everything using a 1/4c/2oz disher (average icecream scoop) and one was perfect for the muffin size three heaping each was more than enough per loaf. Mixed warm softened 8oz creamcheese with 3T real maple syrup for a drizzle to serve. Not too sweet and very delicious. Heading out to take mini loaves to homebound elderly neighbors. Yay autumn!",
