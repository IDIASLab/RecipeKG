Left it out all night and then it was set. I did have left over filling because I didn't have a deep dish crust and I put it over ice cream. Amazing. I topped it with whip cream with a little chocolate Godiva liquor and a little sugar. I am certain it would have gone great with the pie. My dog ate the entire thing off the counter. Lame. I will have to do it again lol.",

I also have found that it sets up very well if you refrigerate it after it is cooked and has cooled just know that when you heat up a slice in the microwave it doesn't take very long. This is great served with vanilla ice cream! It really does taste like a prailine. My husband's favorite!",
