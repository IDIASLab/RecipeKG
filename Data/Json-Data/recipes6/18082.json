Traditional yakatori is sliced thin and threaded onto skewers. The meat is easily sliced when partially frozen. I make this dish for lots of parties and potlucks. It's always the first to go.",

I laid in a glass 9x13 dish and poured the marinade over all, flipping occassionlly.  You can always tell a good marinade by seeing how much steak sauce my family uses with the steak. Tonight, very little was used b/c the flavor was great!  Highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks Rayna!",
