The only reason it received 4 out of 5 stars was because after 8 hours in the oven, I had to put it in my dehydrator to finish up.  The lowest my oven goes is 170 degrees.  I started it, set the timer for 6 hours and walked away.  Apparantly because my oven is one of the newer models, it turns off the heating element when the door is open.  The fact that when I followed the recipe and stuck a spoon in the door to keep it open, it turned off the heating element and didn't bake the leather :(  A note to all who might have a newer model oven, check the users manual to see if it turns off the heating element when the door is open.  If that's the case and you dont have a dehydrator as a backup, this might not be the right recipe for you.  For everyone else, this is a great recipe.  My kids loved every bite and I felt good about giving them something healthy without all of the additives most \"fruit snacks\" contain.  Thank you for a great recipe!",
