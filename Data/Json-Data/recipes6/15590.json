Since there were 2 packages of jello I used a total of 4 cups of water. I think there were too many marshmallows. Half the amount would be plenty. I heated the jello added the marshmallows and melted them. The topping was very good but had a tendency to \"slide\" when the salad was cut into squares. The overall taste was good. I would make it again but with changes.",
