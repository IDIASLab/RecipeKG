I cheated and used the \"real bacon pieces\" instead of frying and crumbling my own. Put all together the night before and popped into the oven in the morning.  It was perfect!

                "reviewBody": "The first time I made this recipe, I liked the make-ahead convenience, but to be honest, the taste was very bland.  Also, I couldn't fit 8 slices of bread into a 9x13 pan without overlapping them (I'm surprised no one else mentioned this).  So I modified the recipe as follows.  I reduced the bread to 6 slices (even with only 6, they still went up the sides of the pan a little) - soft breads are good because they absorb the egg mixture and bake up nice and fluffy (I used a soft, fresh whole-wheat bread).  Then I greatly increased the cheese and meat (to 2 cups and 24 oz., respectively) and reduced the eggs to 8, because I prefer a less \"eggy\" taste.  I also used Dijon mustard (instead of dry mustard) and upped it to about 1/4 cup.  After these modifications, the result was much more satisfying and flavorful, in my opinion.  The generous measure of bacon, plus the added plenty of flavor to make your taste buds say \"Wow!\"  You could also use ham - anything that is very flavorful - just be sure to use plenty.  Normally I'm not a big meat or cheese eater, but in this recipe, you really need it or the casserole is very blah.  The original measurement of meat (8 ounces) just got overwhelmed by all the eggs and bread - I couldn't even taste it.  Increasing the meat, cheese, and mustard and reducing the eggs and bread made it much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I added 1/2 t. onion and 1/8 t. garlic powder and increased the dry mustard powder 1/2 t. and also substituted frozen hashbrowns for the broccoli (for my picky husband) and increased the cheese by about a cup or so. It turned out fantastic! I wasn't sure about putting the bread slices in whole- my other strata recipes have you rip the bread into pieces- but it turned out great and was one less step! I also cooked the bacon in the microwave which makes it even easier! It's also very kid friendly- my 3 year old daughter has been asking when we can have it again. Great recipe- thanks!",
