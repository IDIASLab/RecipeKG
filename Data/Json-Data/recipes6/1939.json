I will be trying this with chicken tenders soon, but we actually enjoyed this sauce with the potstickers better than our typical peanut or sweet & sour dipping sauces.  It has just the right balance of sweetness and tang, and mixes up in minutes with ingredients I always have on hand.  I can see this being used on many, many things, just flat out tasty!",
