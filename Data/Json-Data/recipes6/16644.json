I refrigerated 5 hours prior to topping with a sprinkling of brown sugar and diced walnuts and almonds.  I nice variation on using leftover grapes.  However, I think my green grapes were very tart and may use all purple grapes next time.  *UPDATE* I sprinkled a bit more brown sugar and refrigerated overnight...much better flavor the next day!!",
