I didn't use the carrot (no good ones at the store) or the okra (not a fan). But I didn't change anything else. The peanut butter gives the soup fantastic flavor and I love being able to use some of my turnips in it! Since I like things spicy next time I may add a fresh diced jalapeno. But the recipe needs no alterations as it is. I'll definitely be making it Again. Thanks Mary for sharing it!",
