I only used 1T of vanilla (that was plenty!), 3 extra large eggs, and added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I do think that the recipe is a bit vague when it came to the topping though.  My topping came out perfectly and here's what I did.  I let the butter come to room temp and cubed it.  I mixed it with the other topping ingredients until the butter was well blended, there should be no loose flour or sugar.  I baked it uncovered and had to let it go about 45 minutes.  At 30 minutes, the top was still watery.  You MUST leave it in until the topping is crisp on the edges and firm in the middle, that\u2019s what makes it so good.  I didn't see a need to double the topping recipe.  This recipe is perfect to make the day before.  Just make the sweet potato part, cover, and put in the refrigerator overnight.  Make the topping right before you pop it in the oven and it\u2019s perfect!",

I used my mix master fitted with the wire whisk attachment to cream all the casserole ingredients together and it worked really well. It turned out so smooth and creamy. I added about 3 tsp of cinnamon and about 2 tsp of nutmeg which I think was a really nice addition. I had a little trouble with the topping. Nothing serious it may have been my fault actually (I might have measured the butter wrong I later realized). It wasn't crumbly at all so I added extra flour and brown sugar until it got to the consistency that I was happy with. I mixed about 1 cup of chopped pecans in the the butter/sugar mixture and evenly sprinkled it on top. I then used 1 small bag (about a cup) of whole pecans and made a boarder around the edge. (The whole pecans got toasted during the cooking process and were SO GOOD!) I then sprinkled just a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg on top. I was able to make this in the morning and cover it and chill it until that evening when I put it in the oven. DELICIOUS! This will be added to the Family Holiday Faves! Thank so so much for sharing the recipe!",

I couldn't keep my daughter out of the pan.. she had a spoon in her hands the whole time and when you would turn around she was eating it... so if you are having many people to dinner you better make two of these recipes.. when I bought my potatoes I made sure I got all the same size.. then I cooked one in the microwave to see how much potatoe I would get.. it yields 1/2 cup so then I put 7 sweet potatoes in a 9x12 pan in a 400 degree oven for 1 1/2 hrs until they were well done then took out all the sweet potatoe with a spoon.. it was exactly 4 cups.. I used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar because I like the flavor of brown sugar in sweet potatoes and added 1/2 tsp salt to the mixture it brings out more of the flavor.. I also baked it an additional 10 min.. all ovens are different.. I was told I have to make another one today for the left over turkey...",

I used canned sweet potatoes to cut down on prep time and cut the sugar in half.  I also just mixed all topping ingredients without the butter, then melted the butter and drizzled it on top.  I also used only 1 egg, as I didn't want to take a chance on the dish being runny.  It was excellent.  Just sweet enough, and the vanilla added the perfect touch.  Will make this often.",

Oh I cut the vanilla back to one tablespoon it's plenty.I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt it really enhances the flavor. I've made this many times and I never used all the topping I like it to resemble a side dish not dessert. But everyone loves it and we have it numerous times throughout the winter months.
