This is the first recipe I've had that actually held together like a bar and didn't crumble. And it is really good! I had to substitute agave for the honey because I was out. so i put in a little less oil because agave has more moisture than honey. It turned out amazing. I'll be trying it again with craisins and or nuts as well! so excited to experiment with this one.",
