I'd also never used crystallized ginger before - it's fairly expensive I found. The combination with the green onions and marmalade was nice - my palate isn't sensitive enough that I really noticed the sugar vinegar or ginger. I didn't eat this on grilled meats as a previous reviewer suggested - that probably would've been good. I mainly just had it alone like a fruit cocktail. I probably should've also tried a bit of it served warm as suggested. It was a bit interesting though how some \"juice\" developed in the bottom of the bowl after the mixture sat in the fridge for a while. In the end I found this to be a fairly good dish. It didn't knock my socks off since I'm not much into peaches. But I suspect that people who love peaches and are a bit adventuresome will probably give this a 4- or even a 5-star rating.",

It was excellent for dipping some tortilla chips in and I think it would be fantastic on chicken beef or fish. My husband absolutely could not stop eating this salsa.
