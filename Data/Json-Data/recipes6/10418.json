Since I don't have a bread maching, I made some adjustments to make it by hand.  I used a yeast starter (combining the sugar, warm water, and yeast in a bowl and let it sit for ten minutes) and then combined the flour and salt in a bowl and slowly added the starter to it, mixing as I went.  I added a little flour in order to make the dough a nice soft consistency as I kneaded.  I let it rise in an oiled bowl for about 45 minutes and then punched it down, added fresh and pickled jalapenos plus 3 different types of cheese, all cubed.  I put it in an oiled bread pan, and let it slightly rise again for about 20 minutes.  I then baked it in the over and it turned out beautifully browned and fluffy white in the middle.  Gorgeous and yummy!  We ate 2/3 of the loaf as soon as it came out of the oven!",

Used more cheese than recipe calls for (3/4 cup) and glass jar jalapenos. I will keep tweaking because the cheese still melts into the bread & I want to be able to bite into a chunk.
