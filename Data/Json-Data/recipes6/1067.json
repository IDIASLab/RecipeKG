It's the only chili seasoning I use, it's fantastic. I only use the 4 tsp of onion powder and don't add the extra 2 tsp. listed a couple lines below. It might be a misprint. I make it exactly as written but sometimes omit the bay leaf depending on if I feel like digging it out when the chili is done. It's soooo much better than store bought. I also don't always add the full tsp of cayenne pepper if I want our kids to be able to eat it but I like it that way too.",
