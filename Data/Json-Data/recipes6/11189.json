She licked the spoon and decided it was worth carrying on. after pumping up the jam we moved on Livin Joy and added the powder topping with coffee.... to mix it up a bit we blasted 2 Unlimited and thought we would add a mars bar to the top powder layer. we really had given up with the idea of it working but after sittin in the oven for 35 mins we decided it looks and smells amazing!!! we havent eaten any yet but i just thought i'd share the moment.... techno techno techno techno UPDATE: this was the most vile thing i have ever had the misfortune to eat. out of 4 of us all 4 of us thought it was not good!! considering we are all hardcore chocolate junkies not even we could handle this!! i still feel like its attached to the roof of my mouth and we ate it literally a month or so ago. avoid at all costs!!!!",

I used half a cup of milk with three quarters of a cup very strong coffee and thought it worked very well. I also used a slightly larger pan because I have a weak oven that often won t cook cakes all the way through. Ice-cream is a definate must when serving and I also suggest letting it sit for about half an hour to an hour before hand this helps it set fully. Overall a big hit with my flatmates!",
