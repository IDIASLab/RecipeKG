I DID make two changes: I used butter instead of shortening (which I always do and have not experienced a problem before) and I added an extra ounce of baking chocolate. The flavor was pretty good but the cake crumbled too easily. I made a 12\" round cake and it was done in exactly 24 minutes. I didn't make the icing but used a rolled fondant icing instead. There is a chance that I made a mistake and it's not the recipe's fault but I don't think that's the case. I'll keep looking.",

Covered it with a mixture of 1 can vanilla frosting and 1 tub of coolwhip. Rolled it up and topped it with the recipe for Chocolate Ganache on here. It turned out like a marvelous yummy gigantic swiss cake roll and everyone loved it! If you are going to make a roll cake remember to roll the cake up by placing a towel well coated in powdered sugar on the cake and rolling it up around the towel and letting it cool this way. Then it won't crack up in the end when you fill it and roll it. Yum Yum!",

I used four ounces of chocolate because I was pairing it with a very sweet frosting and wanted it to have a deeper chocolate flavor I used cake flour instead of all-purpose and I used the suggestion of cream rather than milk.
