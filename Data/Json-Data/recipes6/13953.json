I used sirloin instead of tenderloin and marnited overnight since it's a slightly tougher cut of meat.  It turned out awesome.  I can only imagine what it must be like with tenderloin (my absolute favorite).  I did add a carton of sliced mushrooms and cooked them with the meat.  I also added a cornstarch and water mixture to the gravy to thicken it.  Served it with Uncle Ben's original reciple long grain and wild rice and broccoli.  Absolutely wonderful.",
