It was a little too overpowering. We tried this a second time and substituted a cubanelle for an anaheim pepper. It was good but still a bit spicy. I think next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes a bit. My two young children thought this was too spicy. I have made this many times and have made changes to suit our taste.
