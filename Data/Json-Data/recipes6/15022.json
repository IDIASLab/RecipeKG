A couple of tips that have made this even better: bake the loaf in a larger casserole dish and double the sauce recipe - it's the best part! Since the loaf itself is just average I use 1 lb ground sirloin and 1/2 lb hot italian sausage and I add about 1/2 cup or so of the fancy (thin) shredded sharp cheddar cheese. This has made a fantastic recipe even better. Also for parties I have made meatballs instead of the loaf baked them and then put them in a crock pot with the double sauce recipe - always a big hit.",

I've made a few changes though: I use 3 teaspoons of dried minced onions add 3 teaspoons of minched garlic and add a 1/2 cup of finely shredded cheddar cheese. Suggestions: When making the sauce add the mustard as the next ingredient after the tomatoe sauce. This will ensure it gets mixed in well. Prior to pouring the sauce over the top of the meatloaf be sure to drain out the fat. I love this recipe it is wonderful!",

Just a couple of tips:  after cooking for 40 minutes, drain the fat before adding the glaze, and secondly, cut back a little on the breadcrumbs if you like it a little firmer.  The next time, I will try substituting the sugar for Splenda.  All in all, this is a def keeper.  Thanks.",

The only difference is that we don't use the white sugar at all we mix the sauce cold and pour it over the meatloaf before baking and cook it all together at one time. Makes for a few less dishes and the taste is excellent. It also freezes well so if you have a small family you can make the meatloaf divide it in half pour the sauce over and freeze. Then all you have to do is thaw and bake.",

I don't like to cook meatloaf in a loaf pan because it traps the fat so I cooked on a broiler pan. I based the meat with sauce the last 15 minutes and served the left over sauce with dinner. It was really good. I am already trying to think of other uses for this sauce it was so tasty.",
