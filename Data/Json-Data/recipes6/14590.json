Simple recipe to make, relatively cheap ingredients...this one is a keeper.  \nI used a 1/2 cup of cocoa instead of the listed 1/4 cup and baked it in a 9\" circle cake pan that I lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  It took about 35 minutes to fully cook.\nFor a vegan 'buttercream' frosting I mixed together 1/4 cup softened margerine, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and about half a tablespoon soymilk or enough to make the consistensy spreadable.  Hope this helps someone! Happy Baking!",

For a great vegan icing, make a whipped frosting such as http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/WhippedFrosting.asp but substitute w/soy milk n' olive oil spread. add some cocoa. its great!
