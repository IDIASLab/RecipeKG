Mix it all together really well and crumble on top of the batter prior to baking. The topping cooks crisp and adds just what the bread needed.",

Extremely moist and really delicious. \n\nFor the second batch I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce as suggested by others.  Equally moist and delicious.  Being somewhat conscientious about using all that oil in the original recipe, I'll opt for the oil/applesauce combination in the future.  \n\nFor batch number 3 I used the oil/applesauce combo, and added the crumb topping suggested by others.  This is exactly how I will make it from now on.  Please note: before sprinkling the topping ontop of the unbaked loaves, you may need to squeeze the topping mix into little clumps, especially if you made the topping in a food processor.     \n\nGreat recipe and definitely try the crumb topping - a winning combination!",

However, I made a crumb topping of 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 Tblsp of butter, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup walnuts.  Mixed together and crumbled on top of loaves before baking.  Furthermore, like Patricia, I replaced 1/2 of the oil with 1/2 cup of apple-sauce.  I actually used a snack pack version with Mango.  You really don't miss the oil. Finally, I used about 2 1/2 cups of zucchini and I drain  / squeeze the liquid out of the shredded zucchini before adding it to the mixture.  Thank you again for a wonderful zucchini bread recipe.  Obviously the final version is a combination of several great ideas.  Good job.",

However I did change it up a bit according to other reviewers' suggestions so I cannot rate the original recipe. I rated the recipe based on the following changes: added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg added an extra cup zucchini used whole wheat flour. Added the crumbly topping as recommended by MarieClaire (I actually halved her recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions: 1/2c flour used whole wheat 1/2 c brown sugar 1 tbsp butter 1/4 c chopped walnuts 1 tsp. cinnamon).

For me it should be one of the more moist and darker in color of all the quick breads. The recipe I normally use only makes one loaf not two. I've found without fail that recipes that make 2 loaves generally are dry and too dense for my taste and this was no exception. That said I substituted applesauce like other did and this was just bland and dry not at all like the moist flavorful recipe I'm used to. I'm going right now to look for my Better Homes and Garden Cookbook where my favorite recipe is. Now THAT is a good zucchini bread and unlike this one you don't have to hide it under a sugary crust to jazz it up--it is healthy all on its lonesome. Sorry folks. I know this may not seem like a very nice review but I guess I'm usually extra disappointed when the reviews are so inconsistent with the results. sigh",
