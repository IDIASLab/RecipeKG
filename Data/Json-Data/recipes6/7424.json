I made it again after I fried the spam on each side until lightly browned and then grilled like a grilled cheese sandwich. Cut in half. All the kids I had over that day said it was the best so I will make it again for them! Cooked slices of ham would taste better with pineapple though. I generally fry (drained well) pineapple with cubed ham and then place on top of crescent for the adults.;)",
