                "reviewBody": "Very nice recipe. I cooked a meaty ham bone from the freezer in the crockpot overnight and used the broth from that in place of the water and chicken bouillon. I kind of reserved the method. I cooked the potatoes in the ham broth in a large sauce pan. I cooked the onion celery garlic and carrot (not called for in the recipe) in the butter. Added the flour and made a roux using 2 cups low fat milk. I added the seasonings to the roux / milk mixture. Once the potatoes were done I dumped them and the broth into the large pot and added the ham from the ham bone and the corn. If you like larger pieces of potato in your soup leave it as it. If you like a smoother more creamy soup use a potato masher to smash up the potatoes and broth before adding the the creamy vegetable mixture. The white pepper gives the a very tasty finish. If you are sensitive to pepper cut the white pepper back to 1/2 tsp. I garnished the soup with a little grated cheese and diced chives. Served with a crusty bread it made for a wonderful dinner. Thanks for a good recipe Cara.",

Chose this recipe over others on the site because of the cauliflower and when I went to the grocery store they were sold out of cauliflower! Since the soup was short a vegetable I added diced carrots. Omitted the salt reduced the garlic to one clove added sliced scallions and minced fresh parsley. Think it would be even better with the cauliflower. Good with or without shredded cheddar cheese on top.",

Since the holiday season was recently upon us there has been an over abundance of HAM in both our families dinners. I hate to be wasteful so I started off my day with a traditional English brekkie of Bubble and Squeak (which I highly recommend to anyone that has leftover veggies from a roast) and then this delicious meal for dinner. I actually added a bit more flour to the milk mixture because I enjoy thick hearty soups. We topped off our bowls with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and green onions. This was a fantastic recipe we will definitely use again. Thank you!",

I did use chicken broth in place of the water as others have done. The only other thing I did differently because the ingredients seemed kind of bland is I added a 1/2 tsp of basil 1/2 tsp of sage and a 1/2 tsp of onion powder. Don't really think those amounted to much. After the soup was made and I had a small bowl to taste and review I then added a box of gnocchi. I ate almost 3 bowls in one sitting!
