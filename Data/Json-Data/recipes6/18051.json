I would suggest making sure that when you add the fennel it is very thinly sliced, and after dropping the fennel into the pan, test it with a fork and don't add the other ingredients until the fennel has become a bit soft.  Muscles are delicate and the sauce should be too so as to complement them with a delicate sauce as well.  The first time I made this the fennel was still as crispy and I had realized my mistake.  The second time I let the fennel cook a bit and all around it came out spectacular.  A+  ",

As children in France we used the shells as spoons to eat the steamed mussels and the soup. It has to be mentioned that unopened shells MUST be discarded.
