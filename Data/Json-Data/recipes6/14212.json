I've had a hard time finding anyone that knew what I was talking about when mentioning this pie. I am very thankful to have found it! It tastes even better than I remembered. My husband helped me make it. So that right there tells you how easy it was to make. I ate one piece and my husband ate the rest.It was soooo good!!! Our two year old daughter liked it as well. It didn't even last a full 24 hours. I know that it's goining to be a favorite of the entire family.",

The cans specified are much smaller than those that are available at my grocery store so I had to measure out 10 ounces of each. The pie set right up within half an hour. If I'd put two regular sized cans of both types of milk in the pie would quite likely have been the runny mess others have described. But if you pay attention to the measurements you get something that tastes and feels almost exactly like the pies I remember my great aunt making in old-fashioned metal ice cube trays.",

If you try to freeze the filling for several hours it will get soupy when defrosted to eat. Some sort of reaction must take place between lemon juice and condensed milk and this takes \"TIME\". I will try to reduce pet milk and mix lemon juice and condensed milk first before adding ingrediants seperatly into the whole mix. Best tating lemon pie I ever ate and all my friends think so too! This is the only saving grace for this pie though.....",

Without reading the recipe I glanced at the photo and included a pre-packaged deep-dish graham cracker pie crust on my shopping list. Sure enough I had about 2 cups of extra filling leftover which I stored in seperate containers to be eaten like pudding. Who cooks a \"pie\" in a 9 X 13 inch baking dish? 2. It gets worse: FILLING DID NOT SET! This after 24 hours refrigeration. Obviously there is too much of a liquid ingredient which one I'm not sure. I was very careful with the measurements careful to correctly translate the outdated listed quantities (evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk are available today in 12 and 10 oz. cans respectively not 5 oz.). The mixture wasn't \"firm\" as stated. The end result was a gloopy mess less set than pudding. The leftover filling I had reserved never set either after days of refrigeration. The taste was good deepening the mystery of which ingredient was over-quantified. So many cooks have had setting failure with this recipe that it should be removed from the site.",
