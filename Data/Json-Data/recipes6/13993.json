Advice on the sugared almonds: Let the sugar start carmelizing just a bit before you add the almonds. Adding the nuts too early can make them toast too brown before the sugar carmelizes. Adding the nuts too late will mean the sugar browns before the nuts get toasted. You'll have to experiment a little to get this just right but it's worth it! I've use chopped walnuts too. Very delicious! My guests loved it too.",

In my dressing I also like to use a bit of lemon or lime juice along with the vinegar to give it a bit more zing. If I don't have any red pepper flakes I use a dash of tabasco sauce or some paprika and chili powder. And I always wait until I'm ready to serve to pour the dressing on!! Thanks for the recipe!!",
