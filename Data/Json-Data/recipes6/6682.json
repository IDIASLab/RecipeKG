The changes that I made were to use ground ginger instead of minced (what I had on hand), 2 cans of cut baby corn instead of carrots, sauteed mushrooms instead of the celery, and used ramen noodles in place of vermicelli.  I also added a little sesame oil to my bowl and had everyone else at the table taste it...they ended up adding it to theirs also!  I think the only change that I will make next time is to cook the noodles separately and put them into each bowl and then ladle the soup over the top.  Just a personal preference!",
