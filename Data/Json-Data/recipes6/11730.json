Reynolds brand even makes a heavy duty NON STICK FOIL that worked perfectly for me. For those of you who ended up with pumpkin caramel....you didn't cook it long enough...end of story. I used a candy thermometer, and cooking it on medium takes about 25 to 30 min. to get to the softball stage. If you cook it long enough then this recipe is foolproof. I did use an entire 12 oz. bag of the chips and the pumpkin pie spice. I have gotten rave reviews on this.",

Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down so it's just enough to maintain the boil and stir *occasionally* as the directions say, for 18 minutes.  You do not need a thermometer. I checked the temperature after 18 minutes and it was not up to soft ball stage.  I chose to follow the directions rather than my thermometer and the fudge is perfect. It is also good with chopped walnuts.",

I made this a couple of days ago and had multiple requests for the recipe. Very easy. The changes I made to the recipe were adding a full bag of vanilla chips and adding 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg so that way it would have more pumpkin pie taste. I didn't use a candy thermometer and the fudge wasn't dry or gooey. It set up perfectly. I highly recommend this recipe for a fun Thanksgiving treat.",

It took me three tries to get this right because I had never made fudge before---but once I used a candy thermometer (234 F) for the final boil this was easy as can be. Tips for those just trying it out: I replaced the cinnamon with Pumpkin Pie spice and I just sprayed my pan with a non-stick butter spray instead of using the foil. Other than that use a candy thermometer to get this right on the last step.",
