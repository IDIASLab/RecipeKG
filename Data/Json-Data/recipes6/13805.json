It reminds me more of Toby's Tofu Pate than eggless salad but it is at a fraction of the cost- which I love!

I'll hand it to Jill - this is pretty darn close to the real thing.  It is absolutely critical that this recipe sit overnight (24 hours optimal) to let the flavors combine.  I can't stress that enough.  I ended up substituting curry for tumeric, white pepper for black pepper, and eliminating the sweet pickle.   (I never put it in my regular egg salad anyway.)  Also per my traditional recipe, I topped with paprika, and added two full stalks of celery and a half an onion.  *AWESOME.*  Thanks, Jill!",

I slice mine in half wrap it in cheesecloth and set a plate with a 30 ounce can of something on it for at least 20 min often longer. That way it's dry and crumbly and able to absorb the flavors better. We upped the mustard a lot just out of preference as many others have done with spice/heat. But the recipe as is is as simple as a basic egg salad and just as good. My kidlet tried it right after I made it and loved it as-is even before letting it meld for a few hours. This is a great protein-rich sandwich filling perfect for school lunches. Oh and we use Vegenaise so it was completely vegan. This recipe is going in the permanent rotation.",
