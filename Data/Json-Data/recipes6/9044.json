I've known my husband for close to 15 years and have been cooking chicken for him about as long. He said this was the best chicken I've ever made! I did tweak the recipe by adding a tablespoon of sugar during cooking and then adding a 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch mixed in a little soy sauce at the end to thicken the sauce a bit. Yummy! I will certainly make this for guests sometime.",

I made a couple changes..I added just a pinch of ground ginger.. after I mixed all the ingredients I threw them all in a Ziploc bag along with some fresh sliced mushrooms and some chopped green onions..I let everything marinate for about 30 minutes in the fridge before I cooked it.. I used boneless,skinless chicken thighs so it only took about 45 minutes to cook.. My husband isnt a big rice fan so I just served it over some green beans and a nice salad.. I think the mushrooms and the onions made all the difference..\r\n\r\nKiki (Brampton,ON Canada)",

I added a little lemon juice to the sauce, and then marinated boneless breasts in it for a half hour before baking.  I baked for 45 minutes and that was plenty of time.  I put the chicken on a rack in the pan & basted frequently.  By then end the rest of the sauce cooks away and would make a mess on the pan if it isn't non-stick.  The chicken comes out quite good, nice for those who like orange.",

I marinated for 1hr 15min beforehand and used Lipton's Golden Onion soup mix (1 packet is 1.3oz which might be why the sauce was so thick.) I also added 3 chopped green onions.
