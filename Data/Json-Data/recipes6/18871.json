Smear dressing mixture over top and SEAL in the salad ingredients with the dressing from edge to edge. Now refrigerate overnight. Just prior to serving toss salad. Your veggies will be nice and crisp and fresh and the dressing will have developed properly.",

The dressing definately must be refrigerated to blend the flavors which in the original recipe included 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar. I do add 1/2 cup shredded parmesan and some shredded colby-monteray jack blend to the veggie mix. I think that REAL bacon makes a difference too as my recipe calls for 1 pound crumbled. This is not a low cal low fat recipe but for low carb fans it does fit if you use Splenda instead of sugar (a little less as Splenda seems sweeter). I also do chop the brocolli and calif. somewhat small and keep the lettuce just chopped. I'm bringing this tonite to our neighborhood party hope they like it!!!",

However I made it again but this time I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and I like it a whole lot more. It had a nice 'zing' to it. I kept the rice vinegar a splash of apple cider vinegar onion powder Parmesan and I added dill weed. It is sooo good! I use it also as a vegetable dip as well as for my daily salads. It's perfect now and guilt free. Try it sans the mayo and it will be much less greasy and caloric.",
