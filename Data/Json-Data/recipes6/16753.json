        "description": "The Vasilopita is a Greek New Year's Bread. It is made in honor of a beautiful act of charity by St. Basil to the poor and needy of his flock. In order to ensure that the needy would have money for life's necessities, and knowing that they were also proud people, St. Basil had the ladies of his church bake sweet bread with coins baked into them. In this way he could give them money without demeaning them at all. It is therefore traditional to bake a coin into the Vasilopita (St. Basil's Bread). The one who receives the coin is considered to be especially blessed for the year.",

Had a bit of trouble with the recipe because the first part instructs you to put milk yeast and some flour to rise but then it doesn't specifically tell you to mix it in with the big bowl of flour. My dough was almost too much for a 9\" round pan. The flavor is really good and it makes some of the best toast I've ever had! It's close to my grandmother's recipe which I've been trying to replicate for several years.",

When making this recipe I kept thinking \"This can't be right. This can't be right.\" The only flavor in this cake comes from cinnamon and nutmeg and a half teaspoon of each to over 6 CUPS of flour? The crust cracked and separated from the loaf (a symptom of overproofed dough yet the dough hardly rose during the 90 minute proofing time.) This vasilopita is one of the ugliest cakes or breads I've ever baked. The crust is extremely tough. I split the dough into two round cake pans (I can't imagine making this into just one gigantic cake yet the recipe simply says \"Put the dough into a pan \") and let it proof for close to 90 minutes (yet it hardly rose - no small wonder as there was a huge amount of dough.) When I put it in the oven it rose very tall. Despite rising so tall and being a rather voluminous cake/bread/whatever it's supposed to be it's a strangely dense fluffy... thing.",
