I followed the recipe exactly and got a fairly stiff batter which made 16 muffins using the large size muffin liners.\r\nWe also made another batch substituting 1-1/8 cups of mashed banana instead of the applesauce (make sure you measure it took 4 large bananas) and we added chocolate chips instead of the blueberries and believe it or not they were even better, I know that the chocolate chips are not as healthy as the blueberries but if the kids like them, they still have lots of fruit and fibre from the oatbran and banana so I feel they are still a pretty nutritious snack.  We will definitely make them again maybe even try almond extract with  fresh cherries and shaved almonds, these muffins make a nice breakfast treat especially good if you are rushed because they can be eaten on the go, just bring along a milk box or a coffee and you're all set.",

They turned out very moist and have good flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups of applesauce and didn't have blueberries so I substituted dried cranberries. I think blueberries or raspberries would really make these better. Also, I found that 18 minutes was too long to bake, try 15 minutes instead.",

Even a few days later these muffins are just as moist tasty and melt-in-your-mouth as when they were first baked. We froze the majority of them to have a quick breakfast on hand. Just defrost overnight in the fridge and throw them in your toaster oven or mircrowave in the morning. Definitely beats skipping breakfast!",

I added more cinnamon and also a touch of nutmeg and ginger and didn't use any nuts. This time I used frozen raspberries and bluberries and they were lovely!

So no major changes. The muffins were lacking flavor and I should have known they would be a little dry due to the batter being extremly thick. I'll continue to make the Blueberry Zuchinni Bread from this website instead its much better.",
