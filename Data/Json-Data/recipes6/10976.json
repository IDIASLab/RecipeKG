                "reviewBody": "I have made this cheesecake several times. This recipe was taken from Sunset magazine I still have the original. If your cheesecake is undercooked check to make sure that your oven is properly calibrated and heating evenly throughout. Also don't forget that the sour cream is for divided use. A great dessert. PS the dough is eggless to prevent salmonella as the temp of the cake never reaches an egg-safe level. I wouldn't buy/use a cookie dough with egg and use in this recipe. Take two minutes and make your own. _________________________________________ Back to edit years later: to clarify my original post Sunset magazine DIRECTLY addressed the egg-safe/salmonella element of preparing your own cookie \"dough\" for the cheesecake recipe - specifically to avoid salmonella contamination. The 1993 recipe states that the Sunset kitchens could not recommend the use of commercially prepared cookie dough (with eggs) because the temperature within the cooked cheesecake might not reach past 160 degrees F in all ovens. As far as I am concerned on a personal level - what is the big deal about making something yourself without eggs in two minutes' time? Are you really so lazy that you have to use a commercially prepared chemical-filled product in the place of something you can create with two brain cells rubbed together and a mixing bowl? After all - you're making the cheesecake from scratch. Why not actually make it yourself?!",

I let my 10 year old add the cookie dough his first cheesecake...so it was lumpy throughout the cheesecake...but still good! The consistency of the cheesecake is awesome! This recipe is cheaper to make than any others I have found and liked. For the crust I used 1-1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs 4 T melted margarine 1/3 c. sugar and 1/3 c. cocoa. I didn't prebake it just set aside. I made the cake and after 40 mins turned off the oven but left the cake inside to cool - do not open the door just leave for 45 mins. Then cool in the fridge - delicious!!!",

What this recipe omits is the key to making sure your cheesecake bakes all the way through but doesn't burn: Turn off the oven after the suggested baking time and let the cake sit in the cooling oven for 30 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR or your cake will crack. Another 30 minutes cooling on the counter away from drafts and only then should you put it in the refrigerator.",
