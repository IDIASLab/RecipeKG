Out of the 22 dough balls this recipe made only half were coated with the amount of chocolate I had so try using 1 & 3/4-2C for the coating. I didn't have any white chocolate to drizzle on top. I also wish the recipe indicates how many balls this would make. It says 15 servings... (I'm guessing 2 each=a serving) but I made 22 using a cookie scoop. I would make these again for an event but would increase the chocolate coating... and thin it out better (I did add a touch of EVOO but the chocolate was still thick).",

As for the recipe, it was simple, fun and delicious! I did not use the milk because I wanted to be able to keep these without refrigeration, but I really don't think it was needed. Also, for better chocolate chip distribution I used mini chocolate chips, which was perfect! I used my heart mold for Valentine's and got about 32 beautiful candies. I will definitely be making this again-yum! Thanks for sharing",

I made a few adjustments to this recipe, including toasting the flour first (not just for food safety reasons, but because toasting it gives it more flavor), reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and use 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips in the filling. The only thing I would do differently next time for the cookie dough would be to add a touch more salt. I also alternated between covering the cookie dough in dark vs white chocolate, and found that the white chocolate was much better with the cookie dough. The dark chocolate almost overpowered, whereas the white chocolate really complimented the cookie dough flavor. I also got 24 1-tbsp sized truffles out of this. Thank you for the recipe--I will be making them again!",

Here are my suggestions (although, I don't think it needs a big change): I think mini chocolate chips would be better in this just for the biting into it factor. This is an excellent base recipe to make other edible raw cookie doughs as well. I may try milk chocolate for the dipping next time. I used a homemade white chocolate for drizzling, and I think store bought would've melted better for decoration, but if you are having a hankering for cookie dough...just make this one and go for it straight! Well done!",
