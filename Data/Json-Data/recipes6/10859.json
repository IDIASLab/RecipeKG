I skipped the topping, added about 1/2 tsp vanilla and instead served it with strawberries and whipped cream.  Imagine a Twinkie with no chemical taste, fresher and more tender...that's the effect I got.  Be sure to mix with a whisk attachment if you have and mix very well as air is the primary leavening here.",

The only thing I did differently was to make 1-1/2 batches and put it in an 8\" x 11.5\" pan and cooked for 23-25 minutes. It has a great texture not too dry not too crumbly not too spongy just perfect. I did not make the topping but used as strawberry shortcake granted the strawberries have been put away awhile and I still cannot stop eating this cake with nothing on it. The only thing I would suggest is to make when the kids are playing.....my 2-1/2 year old thought that the 4 minute and 5 minute beating times were just way too long.:) Will be making again (maybe even in the next couple of days). Thanks for the great recipe. I will never make shortcakes for my strawberries again.",

It originally came from my grandmother or great-grandmother (can't remember which). Although this recipe calls for it to have a broiled topping & many folks here have indicated that they use it as a strawberry shortcake, in our family we frost it with a fudge frosting (the kind that hardens like \"fudge\"). It is a simple but amazingly delicious cake!! The only thing that I will tell anyone looking to make this is to be sure to beat the eggs the full 4+ minutes and to SLOWLY add the sugar, beating another 4+ minutes (in my experience, the slow incorporating of the sugar takes at least 6-8 minutes). For the rest, don't overmix the flour into the eggs, mix just until combined and the same with the milk & butter. Be gentle with this and you will have a devine cake!! Oh, I do add a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well. If I'm making this for a \"crowd\", I double it and make it in a 9x13 baking dish.",

I doubled the recipe to have enough to make two layers about 1 1/2 - 2 inches thick. While this cake was tasty it did not quite fulfill my \"light and fluffy\" hopes. If I were to make this again I think think I would separate the eggs from the yolks and maybe add a little lemon zest for a \"brighter\" flavor. Also this cake took about 40 minutes to bake in a convection oven.",
