I make these at Christmas time and every year before baking time comes I get requests in order to make sure that they'll appear on the plates I make up. This recipe is great if you like your gingerbread to be of the more old-fashioned variety rather than the sweet. I'm so very glad that I found this recipe.

It did much better on a floured pastry cloth and then transfered to the parchment lined cookie sheet. Also sprinkle on extra flour as you roll it out( i may add a little more flour to the recipe next time but you will still need some when rolling. I also added 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cloves and nutmeg with the other spices for a little more kick. They taste wonderful. Mine are possibly a little thinner than a 1/4 inch because I like a little crunch -but the thicker one a just a little bit chewy which is good too! I used minature tree and gb boy cookie cutters and they are so cute -one bite cookies. I did not use the raisins but used Sugar Cookie Icing from this site - using a #3 decorating tip to dot and drizzle the icing(you could also use a freezer ziploc bag with the corner cut out but you will have less control). I will be making these again - and if I could I would give them a 4 3/4 stars. My 20 year old son says he doesn't like ginger bread and he gobbled them up!",
