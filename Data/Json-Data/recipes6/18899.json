I can't say enough about them--my family loved them and ate them up faster than anything else--they are already begging BEGGING for more. Easy to prepare and EXTREMELY tasty! I do have to say though that the rice wine is hard to find if you are not used to cooking Asian foods. Rice vinegar is NOT the same as rice wine!! If you go to an Asian market though there will be a whole shelf devoted to different kinds of rice wine--just get the regular clear one. Also I omitted the sesame seeds and they still came out perfect. I also think I am going to marinade it a little bit longer than the 2-3 hours so I could let that perfect flavor soak in even more--to each their own. THANK YOU for this recipe!!",

I would rec using a little more that the norm on the following: garlic s.seeds s.oil mirin and of course allowing more time for the meat to marinade on the actual sauce. It is delicious!!!",
