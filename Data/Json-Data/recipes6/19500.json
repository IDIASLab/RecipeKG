I followed the instructions as I understood them here, and ended up with something that looked like boiled mini-baguettes.... After looking into it, leaving the dough relatively thin and wet, and working it through a colander or maybe a cheese grater, might be the way to go. I kept adding flour trying to get it to form a ball per the directions, which was a big mistake. The soup's flavor is good, and I'm going to try to rescue what's left somehow....",

If you roll out the dough and flour each side lightly, then roll it up and slice into noodle ribbons, that works.

My husband is a tried and true \"meat and potatoes\" guy, so I was a bit doubtful that he'd enjoy this meal of chicken noodle soup with warm applesauce on the side.  HE LOVED IT!  Three bowls later, he was to full for dessert :-)  This will be one of our cold weather staples!",

Very hearty but more like dumplings than spaetzle. The dumplings that followed this recipe were yummy. Be sure to roll the dumplings into somewhat small balls. Grease your ice cream scoop and the balls should be 1/2 the size. I made the mistake of using the whole ice cream scoop and they soon turned out like baseballs. This is also a somewhat time consuming soup but the soup is still worth the effort.",

This recipe is almost identical to the thickened chicken stew I make today having watched at my mom's apron strings. Our family is PA Dutch and I wonder if this unique preparation of spaetzle is regional... sometimes I will do the noodles on their own in boiling water straing them then fry until golden in butter.
