Once I removed my mixture from heat I still had the consistency of water. It wouldn't stick to anything! So I waited for the mixture to cool some in hopes it would thicken; and nothing. I wish I could contact the person who posted this recipe since the spoon tasted good just could not get it to stick on my apples.",

I think I timed it at an hour which is accurate to what the recipe suggests. I think the reviewer below may not have cooked the candy long enough. I loved the taste. The extra we poured out on a cookie sheet and broke apart. Thank you for sharing!",
