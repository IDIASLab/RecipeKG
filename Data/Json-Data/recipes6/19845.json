It will be thin when it's done, but if it can coat the back of your spoon, it's done. The curd will thicken up as it cools. The written recipe made almost exactly 3 half-pint jars worth. I used high-quality bottled lemon juice and it was a bit too tangy. I think using fresh juice would make a more mellow-tasting curd. Overall, an excellent recipe worth saving. TIP - strain the curd through a fine-mesh seive to remove all the white egg bits to ensure a perfectly smooth curd. **Update - The curd from the original recipe is quite grainy after it's refridgerated. I tested the recipe 2 more times and ended up with a wonderfully smooth, thicker, richer curd that can easily rival the ones you buy in gourmet stores. Use 3 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks and increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. It won't be two sweet but will mellow out the tartness. I still cooked it 5 1/2 min. and it was perfect. Try it.",

To the viewer who asked if Splenda works, yes it does, however, I added 1 1/3 cups of Splenda and 1 Tablespoon of corn starch just to make sure.  Make sure the corn starch is added to cold liquid. I added mine to the lemon juice.  Also, I left out the egg whites as they are unnecessary and thre is no chance of cooked egg whites in the cooked curd.  A great place to use the egg whites is in a great recipe for homemade marshmallows.  I found it on the the food network under \"Hot Cocoa and Homemade Marshmallows\".  They are really easy to make (no temperature gauge)and made by Tyler Florence, and are they wonderfully soft!!! I will try to post the recipe or hopefully someone else will if I don't get around to it.",
