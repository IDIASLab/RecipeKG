This is like the one on the side of a major selling cornstarch, but, since I buy generic, I was glad to find it on the web. I did not use the double boiler but cooked it over a low heat. For those that had a runny mixture, you didn't cook it long enough. Stir constantly and when it starts to \"boil\" like a \"lava\" bed, it will be thick enough to pour. The meringue also takes a long time to whip, so it is best to use an electric mixer. Also, egg whites whip better into meringue when they are at room temperature.",

Cook directly on the burner and whisk almost constantly, let the mixture boil for two minutes while whisking constantly so as to not burn (it takes a while). 2. Reduce the sugar to \u00be cup. 3. Increase lemon juice to \u00be cup. 4. Use 2 Tablespoons lemon zest.\r\nCooling the mixture before placing it in the crust is essential.\r\nThe four stars is for the recipe as written, before my modifications.",

Everything went well, the lemon thickened to perfection and the meringue was piled high and browned.
