I thought it would be an easy alternative to taking the fixings for real banana splits (which she loves!). Everyone loved it and requested the recipe. The co-worker liked it so much she took \"leftovers\" home for her children. The recipe is great but I made a few simple changes---less sugar in the crust mixture (cut to about 1/4 cup used \"light\" cream cheese to cut fat used fewer maraschino cherries and kept the crushed peanuts to about 1/2-3/4 cup. It was still great! I will definitely make this one again.",

I toast 1/2 cups of sliced almonds and sprinkle them on top rather than peanuts. Our family likes this variation.",

After pressing the graham cracker mixture(made from scratch) at the bottom of the pan I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes. I then let it cool off by placing it in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. 2. I used 3 (8 ounce) packages of cream cheese instead of 2. That change required me to use 2 1/4 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of 1 1/2. (I used more because it's a challenge to spread the cream cheese mixture if made with 2 packages over the prepared graham cracker crust without picking up pieces of the crust. Using 2 cream cheese packages is not enough in my opinion. Using 3 cream cheese packages was much easier and quicker for me to spread the cream cheese mixture over the graham cracker crust.) 3. Not a minor change but I used a 20 ounce can of drained pineapple instead of using a 15 ounce can.",
