I addded 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano to the sauce.  I doubled the amount of pasta (to 16 oz.) to serve all five people in my family. I crumbled 8 oz. of feta cheese and mixed it with the entire pasta/sauce mixture instead of just putting it on top.  I think it's great now.",

Saut\u00e9ed a little onion and 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added a little sherry and let it cook down. Only had plain canned tomatoes so I added a good Tbsp of Mediterranean seasoning 1 Tbsp of sugar black pepper and cayenne pepper to them. Added sliced black olives and had to use frozen spinach which I drained well and only used of the box. That worked fine. All I had was fettuccini so I tossed it with the tomato mixture and had to add a little chicken broth because it was a little dry. Excellent!",
