I had remnants of a rotisserie chicken so I made my broth with that and used what chicken was on it. Only used 1 potato b/c Honey doesn't eat them but my teens do. I didn't have evaporated milk on hand but I always have dry milk powder so I added 1/2 C of that instead. Also my pickies usually pick out carrots so cooked them in chunks making the broth and then buzzed them in the blender and then poured them back into the pan. Sneaky huh? I will probably make this again. Thanks for your recipe.",

I changed a few things around so here's what I did differently: 4 stalks celery 6 carrots 2-32oz boxes of broth (low sodium) no potatoes instead of the spices listed I used 1tsp McCormick's Gourmet herbs de Provence 4 cups chicken and added about 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 4 cloves fresh chopped garlic. I boiled chicken in broth and sauteed veggies in a deep sauce pan. I added a few cups of broth to veggies and let them simmer before adding to broth. I used 1 cup of the milk but I think next time I will use a little more. I never used it so I used the bare minimum. I cooked my noodles by themselves and added them to the individual servings instead of dumping them in the soup. It had a good amount of flavor and we both enjoyed it which is pretty rare in my house. This is my new go chicken soup recipe!",
