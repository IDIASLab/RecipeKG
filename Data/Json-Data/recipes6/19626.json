I lined a grill basket with tinfoil and put the chicken and some marinade into it and grilled the pieces that way.  I used dried rosemary and cut the sugar in half.  I also used low fat ranch dressing and completely omitted the salt because it just isn't necessary.  These were melt in your mouth MOIST and DELICIOUS!!  Even my 19-month-old and 3-year-old gobbled this up.  The marinade from the grill basket was also incredible poured over white rice.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!!!\nEDIT:  I've since made this recipe on the stove top and in the oven in order to use up all the marinade (which is INCREDIBLE on rice) and both alternate methods are good by the oven is a better 2nd choice as the stove top method tended to dry the chicken out a bit but still tasted great!  I bake it with all the marinade on 450 for 20 minutes.  Melt in your mouth moist!    EDIT AGAIN:  I tried another reviewers recommendation to use Trader Joe's ranch dressing...just not that good with it.  It might be slightly healthier for you but I'm willing to splurge for the little dressing that's used and use hidden valley ranch light.  Made a HUGE difference to my family and to guests who've had it both ways.  Cut back on oil...but use flavorful ranch dressing!",

We reserved a little of the marinade and added more ranch dressing for a nice dipping sauce on the side. UPDATE: I've made these so many times now because they're just that good.  You can cut down on the oil and substitute dried rosemary for the fresh if you don't have any on hand. I always use the sugar and 1 tsp. of salt vs. two. If you're looking to cut down on calories Hidden Valley Ranch Light Buttermilk Dressing works great with this recipe.  I usually marinate this at least 6 hours. No matter what you do - it's bound to come out moist and delicious.",

I made one batch of marinade for the chicken and another batch to marinate vegetables...onions, portabello mushrooms and quartered new potatoes (about 2 lbs). After you quarter the potatoes put them in a microwave safe dish and add 1/2 cup water. Microwave on high for 13-15 minutes, just stir halfway through cooking time. Otherwise the potatoes would never be done on the grill at the same time as everything else on the skewer! After microwaving let them cool a little and then marinade.  I marinaded everything in a couple of ziploc bags for about 2 hours.  We will definitely make this again and again! ",

It took a little time to thread everything on the skewers and a bit messy, but it was so worth it! Next time I'm going to try putting things on the skewers first, then marinate.
