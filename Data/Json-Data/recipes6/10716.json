The texture was perfect and it was easier to cut too. Also I used some spenda with the sugar to cut some calories and used lowfat cream cheese for the icing.

I used 1 cup sugar (rather than the 2 suggested) for the cake, as well as 2 tsp of cinnamon rather than the 1 suggested as I like a spicier cake.  I used 1/3 cup vegetable oil and 2/3 cup applesauce.  I didn't add any pecans.\n\nThe cake turned out quite moist still, even with the reduced oil.  I had a hard time getting it out of the pan, as parts of it stuck.  After a bit of prodding it was out, but I was a bit worried as it seemed too moist.  (I had baked most of the batter in a rectangular pan, and baked 1 small cupcake for tasting purposes.) But alas my fears were unfounded... Read below.  \n\nI used the Neufchatel frosting suggested, but made one change- used 1 cup of sugar rather than 3 1/2 cups.  Also- didn't mix the pecans in, but rather decorated the top of the cake with it.  \n\nAfter leaving it in the fridge for 1 day, I was pleasantly surprised when it tasted much better than the day before.  The gumminess that resulted from it being too moist the day before, was now a perfect level of moistness, and the frosting tasted delicious with the cake.  You could actually see bits of carrot, and with the toasted pecans on top, it was visually gorgeous.  Everyone loved it!\n\nI'd make this recipe again and again, but still use the modifications I've made above.  I suggest baking the day before, and refigerating.",

My hubby advised me late last night he had to take something for a potluck today (dont you hate that) and since I've been eyeballing this recipe my son and I went to the store and whipped it up! We saved enough batter to make 3 cupcakes so we could all taste it. It was SO fast to make with the food processer and it was devine! I followed previous reviews and used 3/4 cup oil used 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce upped the cinnamon to 3 tsp (we love spice) and added raisins. I decreased the sugar in the frosting to 2 3/4 cups. I put nuts IN the frosting and sprinkled a few more ON the cake (we're nut lovers too). The frosting was fantastic after the cake was frosted I had dibs on the bowl beaters knife you name it they were MINE!;-) Great recipe the pineapple was different but DARN GOOD!",

Continue adding small amounts at a time. # 2 Beat your eggs seperately till very light & gradually add to the sugar oil mixture. You are not incorperating the sugar & oil & the oil separates & will be on the bottom etc. Try this you will never have an oily carrot cake again.",
