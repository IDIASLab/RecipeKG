Too bad I really liked the idea of a sweet alternative to a seasonal favorite. Maybe I'll try again next year with a 275 degree oven...",

We prefer these seeds because it has that salty/sweet thing going on. But I do have a couple problems with the recipe. First be sure to to use a dark pan. I used one dark pan and one light colored metal pan and the dark one definitely browned the seeds better. Second way too much butter--the seeds were seriously swimming in it; I would cut it in half next time. Lastly the temperature is too high--I ended up cooking mine for 1 hour at 300. I did end up having to break them apart after I pulled them out because they stuck together like peanut brittle (although not quite as hard). But their redeeming quality is they actually taste good--although now I'm dealing with little greasy fingers! UPDATE 10/09: Made these again. This time I cooked @ 300 for 45 minutes. Taste great!",
