I was worried about the berries not getting thick with nothing on the berries but lemon juice.  And of course they didn't get thick.  They were runny and not very attractive at all.  The topping was odd also, after adding the water of course it made the batter topping smooth and again not very attractive.  All in all, I won't be making this again. Highly dissapointed. What a waste of great wild blue berries.",

Because of less sugar I reduced the amount of salt to 1/4 tsp.Since frozen berries were much more cost effective, I used those & reduced the boiling water to 1/2 cup. Delicious! One thing I will do different next time: I made this early in the day.It comes out with a slightly crisp topping. But when I reheated it for my guests it made the topping more cakelike. Still delicious, no one knew except me. I'd like to try it next time still warm & crunchy. personal preference Topped with vanila bean ice cream it was delish & plenty sweet.Thanks for the recipe!",

Cut back on the sugar a little bit, added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the crust but other than that I followed the directions exactly!  For those of you tempted to add more blueberries b/c you think that it doesn't look like there is enough in the pan.......don't add more or you will overflow when baking.  The blueberries plump up huge when they cook in the hot water mixture.  Now, I just need someone else to help me eat it!  :)",

She read the reviews first and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (in both parts) as others had recommended. That was about two weeks ago. It was so good that we made it with raspberries when we went to a friends house for dinner last weekend and we made it with some fresh-picked blackberries this morning. Heated and served with some golden vanilla ice cream makes it just that much tastier. My wife noticed that it bakes up better with the fresh berries (as recommended). There was a bit too much juice with the frozen berries (perhaps reducing the water would help). I thought it was great either way. Definitely a great summer recipe.",
