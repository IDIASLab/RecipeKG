Combines soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, dry mustard, garlic, as well as a few other simple ingredients to make a delicious sauce for sweet and sour cut ribs. Great over rice!

Instead of going from parboil/fry/oven, I just threw all the ingredients together to make a marinade, and put in the fridge for a few hours...(I also didn't have any dry mustard, so I just added a squeeze or 2 of prepared mustard)  Then I put the ribs and marinade in a glass baking dish and threw them in the oven @ 325 till they were done.  VERY VERY VERY YUMMY!!!  Thanks for the great recipe HOWITZER!",

I cut up the meat into bite sized pieces, boiled for 1/2 hour, drained and then followed the recipe being sure to brown the meat well.  It was absolutely delicious!  I used rice vinegar as it didn't specify what type and served over white rice.  Both the boyfriend and I just loved it, he would have preferred a bit thinner sauce to mix into the rice but I thought it was fine.  Best sweet & sour we've ever had.  This is going in the recipe box and will be repeated again and again!!!\n\nUPDATE!!!  I cut some pork loin chops into bite sized cubes, shook in salted, peppered flour, browned in oil & then added the liquid with one addition, about a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger.  WOW!  That brought it to an all new level of delicious!",
