Perhaps reducing the amount of oats would help as 1 1/2 cups seems way too much for the amount of dough you save for the topping. You couldn't eat these like a bar because the crumble all fell off. Also they seemed too thin and I will try it with a 9x9 pan next time.",

I added about 2 tbsp extra butter to the dough because it looked way too crumbly to bake well and I didn't want a dry crumbly dessert. I also stopped adding oats after about 1 cup because it looked like enough to me. The first time I baked these they did not turn out. After 35 minutes in the oven the top looked golden brown and the dessert seemed done; I took it out of the oven let it cool a bit cut into it and found that the bottom layer was not done at all. You can't really do the toothpick test on these because the raspberry jam will stick to the toothpick regardless of whether or not the whole thing is done. I had to put these back in the oven and it's been about 15 more minutes now and they still weren't quite done. The second time I baked these I used a 9x9 dish and bit less jam and left them in the oven for 30 minutes exactly; they turned out perfectly cooked. I think the first time the jam may have been keeping the bottom layer too moist to cook properly but I'm really not sure.",
