I followed the suggestion to use additional raspberries combining a package of unsweetened berries with one in a light syrup an d then eliminated the 6 T sugar. In the future I would also try the suggestion from another tiramisu recipe to substitute mascarpone for 2pkgs cream cheese blended with 1/2 c heavy cream and 5 T sour cream as the mascarpone is quite expensive for the minimal flavour it imparts. As I was not cooking at home I had no pastry brush available and simply dipped the coookies in the Grand Marnier syrup which seemed to work quite well. I also used fresh raspberry as a garnish and additional chocolate curls. Yummy!",

Worked fine. The marscapone substitute another reader suggested was outrageous even better than true marscapone! This recipe is easy and delicious! Thanks Den!!",

I used the best raspberries I could lay my hands on and they lifted the dessert into another realm altogether. One hint though? As much as I love chocolate in my opinion this doesn't need it. And it was nothing to do with the quality of the chocolate I used - I just think it adds nothing to it and the next times I make it will be without it. JSPAHN maybe you haven't had tiramis\u00fa before because it's quite clearly not baked; the way I see it you're going to die anyway from all that creamy richness so you might as well not worry but if the thought of uncooked eggs makes you nervous there are plenty of recipes out there for tiramis\u00fa featuring a cooked sabayon (egg yolk mixture) and Italian or Swiss (ie. cooked) meringue. Just be forewarned that you will be sacrificing some creaminess.",

I changed it a very little bit by layering 1 layer of ladyfingers soaked in the syrup 1 layer of the mascarpone mixture 1/2 of the fruit (I used thawed frozen mixed berries) 1 more layer of soaked ladyfingers remaining berries and remaining mascarpone mixture. I dusted this all with cocoa powder and sprinkled a little chopped caramelized peanuts. Delicious but I'll give a try to the recipe as described in the recipe. From coming back from shopping to cleaning dishes it only took 20 minutes! Oh and yes it yields more than 6 servings (I'd say 8-10).",
