I like how the sugar caramelizes slurp! and how this French Toast recipie does not require cinnamon (no cinnamon fan). I did do a little variation using buttermilk normal bread and light brown sugar. Tip: Make sure you mix the batter frequently the heavy nutmeg sits on the bottom with the result that the last bread slices are extra nutmeggy.",
