Substitutions I made to the recipe were the following: Duck eggs instead of chicken eggs and 2/3 cup of mayonnaise rather than sour cream. When finished I glazed the underside of the cake with a mixture of confectioner's sugar orange juice and vanilla. I then plated and turned the cake over and drizzled on a chocolate ganache. Finished with some orange slices that I slightly poached in Southern Comfort I think this cake is going to be a HUGE success.",
