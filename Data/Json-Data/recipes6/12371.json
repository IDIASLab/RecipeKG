Make sure you use an 11x7 pan and I use a metal frosting spatula that has an indent to spread the cream cheese and it comes out perfect. I do have to bake about 10-15 minutes extra. Make sure you bring to room temp when serving to get the best flavor. Waiting a day will also allow the flavors to mingle.",

Also I used rum and Creme De Cocoa for both the filling and glaze I just can't get enough chocolate so I also used peanut butter chocolate swirl chips instead of the reg peanut butter ones.",
