The amount of cinnamon was quite a lot compared to the small amount of pear flesh that was leftover after I was done scooping out the insides, and if I made this again, I would combine all the ingredients together (after melting the butter) and then just drizzle over the pears in the dish.  Maybe even cut whole pears up in slices beforehand to minimize the waste from digging through the top to get to the seeds in the center.  For people not used to eating fruit, this might be a way to get them to eat it, but it's definitely not healthy nor indulgent, and the ratio of butter/sugar/spice to fruit was just way, way off for me.  :(",
