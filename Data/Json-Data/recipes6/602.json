Took an apple and put 1/2 in the neck cavity and half inside the bird along with 1/2 an onion fresh sage rosemary and thyme and baked a 20 pound turkey for 4 1/2 hours. The additional thing I do is take.all the giblets and the neck and put them In a small saucepan with salt and pepper and water. I use that to baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so and continue to add water as I use it back to the cooking giblets and neck. This makes the best gravy juice as well.",
