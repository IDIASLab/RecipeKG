And it must be shortening, not margarine or butter. Also the dough must be chilled for 2 hours (or more- I've made the dough 1 day in advance. I've made these since I was a kid and they are my sons' favorite Christmas cookie.  I watch these cookies in the oven- 10-12 minutes is usual depending on your oven-know your oven!  I do not frost the cookies, but will put colored sugar on some of them.  I agree that the dough is tricky- however, if you chill the dough and have a cold rolling pin and a cold surface (granite/ solid surface), the cookies come out fine- you may also want to roll the dough a little less than 1/4\".  Do not add too much flour in the rolling process- that makes them hard, too.  If you want a more honey-lemony cookie, don't be afraid to increase the honey and/or lemon just a little bit.  ",

They don't taste just like sugar cookies because of the lemony hint of flavor in them but since they are a nonfat option I will be making these INSTEAD of the traditional sugar cookies every time! Since I don't have children old enough to eat sweets yet when they can eat them this is what they will come to know as \"sugar cookies\"!",
