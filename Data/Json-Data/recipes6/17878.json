                "reviewBody": "Good recipe Marty! Thanks for sharing.Some months back I tried my first Allrecipes Beer Chops recipe. Since then my knowledge for cooking drinking etc...with beer has greatly changed. here are some facts to ponder on beer before cooking this recipe yourself. Is your favorite brand of beer a lager ale or malt? You can not just run to the local store and grab the cheapest thing you find. You don't have to buy the most expensive either. The only thing you must do is adjust your flavors accordingly. The way you store your beer can have an effect not only on the drinking quality of beer but cooking with it as well. A bottled beer tastes much different than a can beer. Storing a bottled beer on it's side can cause the yeast to oxidate with the cap. Always store your beer upright. Be careful when buying can beer. Always know the brand of beer is just fine to your palate and liking before cooking with it. Also the less expensive beer will naturally have a higher salt taste than a more expensive beer. When using a less expensive beer adjust the measure of salt down for the recipe. I hope this review helps anyone who is willing to explore cooking with beer for this recipe and others. Best Dishes and Enjoy!!",

I used season salt rather than regular salt but that didn't seem to help any. All I could taste was the pepper and my 13 month old would have nothing to do with it. If I make again I will add some onion and garlic to the hamburger when I brown it. Also the cook time was much longer than stated. It took almost an hour on low for all the moisture to cook out of mine. I ended up removing the lid and turning the heat up to medium.",

I'm pretty impatient sometime when cooking; I ended up after 14 minutes or so of simmering on \"low \" raising the heat to just above medium and it took about another half hour. Outside of that made the recipe exactly the way it's published here. It's the first dish I've made in a while where the spouse specifically asked: \"Is there more of this?\" while still eating. After putting meat on rolls (potato hamburger rolls) I topped with some \"medium-diced\" white onions and smattered a small amount of mayo/Miracle Whip on rolls. We both really liked this sandwich. I can't tell you how the other two residents of our home liked the recipe... since there was none left to scrape into their dishes (And boy did they look unhappy about that)!",
