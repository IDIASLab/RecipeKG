Semisweet chips definitely give a depth of flavor you just can't get from cocoa powder. Be sure to use quality chocolate chips to ensure the best chocolate flavor. Also, you might want to temper the eggs before adding them to the warm chocolate mixture or allow the chocolate mixture to cool a bit so you don't end up with scrambled eggs in the batter. I used a 16 ounce bag of chocolate chips, melting the 1 1/2 cups as the recipe calls for and adding the extra 1/2 cup to the cooled batter so I could have chocolate chunks in the brownies.  (If you do add the extra chocolate chips, toss them in a teaspoon of flour to coat them so they won't sink to the bottom of the pan.) Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'll be making these brownies again and again!",

In fact, I have to go change my review of another brownie recipe because this one is absolutely the best (and I can't say that about the other recipe anymore). Tastes just like the brownies out of a box. I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 25 minutes, and they are perfect. I have to hurry and freeze them so I don't eat them all in one sitting. Next time, I will omit the salt, but that is the only modification I will make. Except doubling or tripling this recipe! Worth the hype. This will now be my brownie recipe of choice. Excellent! *update: these are just as delicious after being frozen! I defrosted at room temperature in a sandwich bag. Still delicious! *update 2: I have also made these as mini cupcakes. In the oven for 7 minutes makes them just cooked enough. Yum, yum, yum! Huge hit at a recent party!",

I mean to try to describe these brownies using just one word may be virtually impossible, just as impossible as it is to eat just one of these. If you LOVE chocolate, then this is the brownie for you! Definitely have a tall glasss of ice cold milk on hand, 'cause you're gonna need it! I substituted 2 Tbsp. of coffee liqueur for the water and since a bag of Hershey's chocolate chips is 2 cups I took the other 1/2 cup and tossed those into the batter before baking - I mean you can never have too much chocolate. I baked them for 30 minutes in an 8x8 glass pan sprayed with Pam for baking. I highly recommend rinsing/wiping down your knife between each slice when cutting your brownies so you get nice slices. I topped them off with a dusting of confectioners' sugar and next time I might add in some chopped walnuts. These are a must try for all the brownie lover's out there!",

I was really craving brownies, but was out of cocoa powder, so I wanted a recipe that didn't require it. These brownies definitely hit the spot...I ate so much, I went to work out afterwards! The use of chocolate chips in this recipe make the chocolate taste more \"chocolatey\" if you will. It is very rich and better than any store bought I know of...I feel less guilty about eating these than the boxed mixes that have additives, preservatives, and hydrogenated oils. These brownies are killer. One thing though...I baked mine for more than the recommended time. I was concerned about doing this because the recipe stresses not to overbake the brownies, but I guess it varies by oven. I used the toothpick test and it did not come out clean, so I baked for about another 12 to 15 minutes. The edges were just crispy and the middle was just done, almost fudgy..... Also, I didn't have an 8x8 pan, but I wanted brownies so bad that I used a round dish (not even a pan, a dish!). But it didn't matter. YYYUUUUMMM!!! Try these...you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing this one. It's a keeper.",

I only put 2 1/2 cups choc even tho I doubled the recipe! I also only put a little less than 1 cup of sugar... even then it was too sweet! the texture came out perfect! This was okay... but I would not rate it as the \"best brownies I've ever had\"!! maybe you'll have better luck than me! *_*",
