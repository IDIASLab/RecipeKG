I subtituted the lemon extract with about 2 tbsp lemon juice and the rind of 1/2 a lemon, and the shortening with unsalted butter. Oh, and I used skim milk. : )\n\nI'm giving this cake four stars because I felt what really made it amazing (even my father went back for seconds! unheard of!) was the lemon glaze I topped it with (just mix lemon juice, confectioners sugar, and lemon rind) and the lemon ricotta creme I served on the side. The combination was oustanding. For the ricotta creme, I just threw about a cup of ricotta (part skim), tbsp lemon juice, lemon rind from one lemon, 1 tbsp half and half, and maybe 2 tbsp sugar? because you can throw it all in the blender, you can really just adjust to your liking.\n\nWonderful recipe. This is probably the new family favorite!",

Only had skim milk on hand which worked fine. I iced it with a lemon icing and topped with strawberries. Yum!",

UPDATE: what a disappointment... this cake is nothing other than a mock angel food cake. it didn't rise much and it actually fell a little in the middle (had it been in a tube pan like a normal angel food cake that wouldn't have happened). because it fell the center of cake is a bit gummy while the edges taste pretty decent (but like i said like an angel food cake). if you're looking for a good lemon cake i recommend looking for another recipe. i won't try this recipe again.:(",
