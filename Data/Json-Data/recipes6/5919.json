Went heavy everything, including meat. Used and doubled the taco season recipe from the site, as it only made 1 ounce. Added extra corn, and rinsed black beans; almost a can of each. Incorporated the cheese as directed, but the texture changed. It was fine, now just a \u2019true skillet\u2019. To loosen the meat I added maybe 1/2 C salsa which gave it great heat, and another dimension of flavor! As the cheese kinda disappeared, just added more on top. I served w/ chips, but believe next time I\u2019ll serve over a bed of lettuce. (Or as a taco as other suggested.) An absolute meal in itself, just a bit heavy. Recognizing that I served with cob corn as a side, which he didn\u2019t eat ??. Try adding condiments of jalape\u00f1o, bite size tomatoes, and sour cream!",

Otherwise I did follow the recipe and the directions. This was good and I'll make it again with perhaps a few additions/changes. I loved the rice mixture in it! I will buy more of that rice! Love it!
