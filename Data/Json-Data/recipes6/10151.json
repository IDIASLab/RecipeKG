                "reviewBody": "Made as written and everything came together just as it was supposed to. The problem is in the sauce. It was entirely too sweet and tasted like a very thick sugary lemonade. I would recommend reducing the sugar by half but then if you do that you'd have to add more cornstarch to replace the sugar that was left out. You'd then lose a lot of the flavor so I'd recommend replacing the water with chicken broth. This recipe has potential but as written I cannot give more than 2 stars. The chicken was fine but the sauce got trashed. Another thing I will point out is that while you could smell the cloves while the chicken was cooking, you could not taste it in the finished dish. That was a bonus for me but if you do want to be able to taste it, you'll need to add more.",
