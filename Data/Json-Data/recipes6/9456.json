I have made it several times, sometimes I add minced, buttered garlic, or onion to the dough, and cook.  Very, very good!  I don't even plan to ever try making Naan with yeast, now!

                "reviewBody": "I am floored by how awesome this recipe is. I had to make it a few times to get my process figured out - but this has quickly become a staple at my house. I use regular flour plus the salt/baking powder ratios suggested at the bottom to make self-rising flour. I also use regular greek yogurt (not non-fat) and the flavor was richer. I found if, once you mix the flour/yogurt together with a fork, you let it sit for about 10 mins, the baking powder activates and the raw dough fluffs a bit in the bowl. Then I scoop a few big tablespoons out onto the counter and add enough flour to get the right consistency to pat it into a rough circle with just my fingers. I get about 6 raw dough circles the size of my palm. I use a large non-stick pan on medium heat with a glass lid. I spray it lightly with oil, season the bottom with whatever herbs suit the meal (like lemon and rosemary, or garlic and onion powder, etc) and add 3 patties with the lid back on (creates a little steam which helps them fluff even more). I cook them 4 mins each side using a timer - they come out golden and fluffy. The amazing thing about this dough is it is a yummy but neutral flavor. You can use herbs to make it savory, add sweets to make it more of a dessert or even add a little wheat germ, ground oats, chia and raisins to make it more hearty, like a breakfast bread. It takes minutes to make and has a ton of clean protein to counter the flour/carb content. It's TRULY amazing. Play with it until you get it to work",
