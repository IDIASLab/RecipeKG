In order to make it sheet-pan friendly, the chicken is not breaded or fried. Add as much of the delicious sauce as you like, and if there is any left, store the sauce in the fridge in a sealed container, up to one week. It's also a great dipping sauce for Asian-style appetizers. Serve over hot steamed rice.",

The slurry amount was perfect for thickening, I used water to help counter the sweetness, and added 1 more Tb soy. I used squeeze garlic and ginger, like another reviewer, and sriracha. Perfect heat.  I wanted some browning, turned on broiler for 3 min to achieve that. I will adjust cooking in future to do that so chicken does not become dry. I jullienned baby carrots, and cut the peppers, onions and chicken as directed, good. Carrots crunchy, peppers, onions had some bite. Chilled the seasoned and oiled chicken  and veg in separate bowls for 4 hours until cooking time and I liked that the chicken soaked up the seasoning and adhered to the surface throughout the cooking and tossing in the sauce. Very good. We enjoyed the better than takeout dinner with rice for soaking up the sauce. Thanks for sharing.",
