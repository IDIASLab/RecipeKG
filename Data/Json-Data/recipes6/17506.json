We actually used generic unsweetened Cheerios and they worked well. They remain crunchy even after baking, and the meringue part is both light and chewy. They kept well for days in a baggie and an airtight container. I could imagine getting creative with what you add to the meringue base! These are too sweet for every day, but I would make them again to fill out a Christmas cookie platter or for a kid friendly and allergy friendly cookie (they\u2019re dairy free as is and if you use gluten free cereal they\u2019re gluten free too!).",
