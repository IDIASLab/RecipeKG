Only changes I would make are the cooking time (takes about 75 minutes for me every time), and the addition of a little vanilla.  \r\nThe next time I made it, I tried to lower the fat content using some substitutes.  I used egg substitute, fat free sour cream, and reduced the amount of nuts, and it still tasted wonderful!  In fact, when I made it a third time, and replaced the butter with low fat milk, my husband said he even liked it better (he's not watching his weight, either).  The only thing I've noticed is that when taking the fat out, the top of the bread does not maintain that \"crispy crust\" for as long as the original recipe.  It gets a little gummy, almost like a sweet glaze, once stored for a day or two.  Not bad, just different.  This recipe also keeps for a while.  So far, I know it lasts for at least a week (maybe longer, but only if it remains uneaten!)  \r\nThis recipe has officially replaced my old Banana Bread recipe.  Thanks!!",

I cut the sugar back by half again (3/4 cup) and instead of using 1 1/2 eggs and 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter, I just cut back on the butter by two tablespoons and used two full eggs. After I started mixing the batter, this did need a little more mashed banana--I added one more. I made no other changes. These turned out perfect. I didn't get 10 muffins out of this recipe, I got 12 and they were quite big. 350* for 20 minutes and they were perfect. I'll make this recipe again.",
