I've used recipes similar to this one that adds pineapples no nuts and an entire package a coconut (great for coconut lovers). HELPFUL TIPS: Coat the candy in the flour used in the recipe before blending and this will help with the candy sticking on the side of the pan. Dip your cutting knife in warm water flour or spray with nonstick cooking spray to prevent the candy from sticking on the knife before cutting up the orange slice candies.",
