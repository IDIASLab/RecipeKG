In the end the bread loaf was good not incredible but good as well as aesthetically appealing. It looks like bakery bread - it's that pretty. Just remember to rap the loaf on the counter a few times before you put in in the oven to remove any air bubbles prior to baking. This is especially important at high elevations. I took the bread out at about 50 minutes and next time I'd take it out 5 minutes sooner. I do however have a convection oven so things always bake a little more quickly. Just in case check it at 50 minutes.",

I just got it out of the oven let it set for about 15 minutes then gently took out of the pan. The cream cheese is not set so I am hoping it will firm up as it sets a little longer. Tastes good.",
