Over baking can also cause your cookies to flatten out.  Cookies will continue to bake after taken from the oven so don't over do it.",

If you use margarine or salted butter, DEcrease the salt to 1/4 tsp or just omit altogether. Salt that is suggested in cookie recipes are generally listed for bakers who use UNsalted butter. This made 36 good sized cookies. I chilled the dough for around 30 minutes, due to reading o thers having spreading problems. I made them a tad larger than a 'normal' sized cookie. I did an experiment and baked these (with above changes) at 350 for 12 minutes, they spread too much, became too brown around the edges and were only chewy in the dead center. Next batch I baked at 350 for 10 minutes, then 11, and finally to 12...because anything under 12 the center was still quite doughy but at 12 they spread quite a bit and were more thin and crispy than soft or chewy. At 325, 12 minutes cookies were too raw and any longer and the center would get overbaked. I then set the oven up to 335, yes 335, and baked for 12 minutes. PERFECTO. Results were: the cookie was softer, only very edges were crisp, center was soft and still slightly puffy. My suggestions would be to add about 1/2 cup more flour, and the full tsp of baking soda (you can not taste it and it does not produce a cake like cookie by any means), if you're kitchen is warm- chill the dough for 30 minutes to an hour and bake for the 12 minutes at 335. This is my new oatmeal cookie. Thanks Dr Amy!!",

My husband is a \"cookie monster\" & said these very well may be the best cookies ever. Here's what I changed: 1) Added 1/2 extra cup flour (for a grand total of 1 and 3/4 cup flour). 2) Cut the salt down to less than 1/2 teaspoon 3)I increased the baking soda by half a teaspoon for a grand total of one FULL teaspoon baking soda 4)Used about 3/4 cup Cape Cod dried cranberries and half a bag of Hershey's milk chocolate chips. 5)I whipped the butter and sugar until VERY light and fluffy. 6) After mixing the rest of the batter I stuck the bowl of batter into the freezer for about ten minutes before baking. I used a cookie dough scoop to make rounded ice cream scoop shapes of dough on the cookie sheet (which I lined with a Silpat baking sheet). 7) I cooked them at 335 until they still looked like they needed another minute or two -- looked a little wet still and when tapped with a finger on top they \"deflated\" a little. 8) I took them out of the oven and left them on the cookie sheet for about two to five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Note: I put the dough into the fridge between batches so it stayed firm. No spreading took place during baking. The day after baking these they remain super chewy and moist. PERFECTION. Good enough to give with Christmas cookie assortment. UPDATE: Add cinnamon!",
