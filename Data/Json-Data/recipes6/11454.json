He liked it but said the chocolate overpowered the dates and he couldn't taste them which he thought was a waste of dates. Would I bake this again? Yes probably.

I always have used a 9x9 to keep this from drying out. I always pour the boiling water over dates and baking soda and let it sit for 1/2 hour as I get everything else together. I think it is unnecessary to separate and mix like you do for most cakes. this is a snack cake and not a fancy cake. I have never added nuts. I sprinkle the top with chocolate chips and then white sugar. The sugar caramelizes and makes a kind of crust along with the melted chocolate. Best the day it's made. By the way my recipe was written over 50 years ago from a friends mom. I think it must be watched closely after 40 minutes",

I used a little less than half of the sugar and added about a tbsp of maple syrup, and I only added the half cup of chocolate chips to the batter and didn\u2019t put any on top. Even with those sugar cuts I\u2019m quite surprised at how sweet it turned out! It was just perfect though! I can\u2019t imagine what it would taste like with the full amount of sugar! I also baked it in a convection oven in a bread pan. I took it out at 55 mins, but I probably could\u2019ve taken it out a smidge earlier because the top was slightly burned. We tried some of the burned bits and they were just like cookies, and the inside baked perfectly, so it was no inconvenience to us!",
