I did the onion, garlic and my addition of mushrooms in the vegetable broth.  I also used 10 ounces Frozen Spinach because I forgot to buy it. I also used Mori Nu Firm.  The base before the addition of the spinach would be great alone.  Wonderful flavor.  The Tofu/Spinach addition changed it enough that since we don't use salt, I added Mrs. Dash Tomato, onion and herb seasoning to taste [which means a LOT in our case.]  To assist the mushrooms in providing the deeper tone that meat would provide, I added a tiny bit of Hickory Liquid Smoke.  It was thick and it cooked very fast however I have a stove with cast iron burners so this will make a BIG difference.  It took an hour to cook totally for me.  It did need additions of Vegetable Broth but since I always keep a large supply on hand this was not a problem.  Simply add as needed.  I pureed at the end.  Then added more broth as needed to desired consistancy and heated, served. I never made a cream soup where I didn't have to adjust at the end for desired thickness.  It's common sense. Oh I also used regular potatoes.  They worked fine.  ",

My kids (ages 6 and 4) complained about it at first (I think because of the color) but they ate most of their big bowls on Thursday and they each had a small cup on Saturday as well. I think the flavored improved as it sat in the fridge. When I was a kid my mom made the most amazing pea soup with leftover ham bones and chunks of ham. I've been a vegetarian for many years now and I miss the full hearty flavor of that pea soup. I've made pea soups in the past with different herbs such as thyme and oregano and I never really thought they did the trick. I had my doubts about the basil but it works quite well. My husband thought it was a very good soup. I will say the tofu does add a bit of a grainy appearance to the whole thing and might cut the pea taste just a little. I don't know if I prefer it over straight-up pea soup but I would imagine the nutritional content of this soup can't be beat. I must confess I used a very good quality cold-pressed olive oil in greater quantities than called for in the recipe! I'm pretty sure I'll be making this again.",

It's a lovely colour of green so it somehow transforms pea soup from a cold winter soup to a light spring soup. I love how fresh it tastes. I can't taste to tofu or soy in the least. I know that this defeats the purpose of a vegan soup but I garnished it with a little bit of goat cheese and it was delightful.",

I wish I had a yellow vegetable to throw in and then it would have been visually perfect! haha I also did half spinach, half kale in the tofu mixture for an even greater variety of nutrients, and I pureed some of the peas with the tofu.
