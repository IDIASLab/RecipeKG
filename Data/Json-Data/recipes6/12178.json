Baking chocolate (not cocoa as some recipes use) makes these cookies rich and fudgy.  You can't mess these up; even little children enjoy making them.  The recipe should say \"4 ounces of unsweetened chocolate, MELTED AND COOLED\".  Also, chilling the dough is an important step - otherwise, the dough will be too soft to work with.  I chill it overnight, then put the bowl out on the counter for 1/2 hour before beginning to bake.  (If the cookies don't spread as much as you'd like during baking, you can start pressing down gently on the tops of the cookies before putting them into the oven.)  We love these cookies - they're brownies in cookie form!",

Then I used a lightly oiled tablespoon scoop to drop the dough into the confectioner's sugar. I rolled it around for a bit and then formed it into a ball before plopping it on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. I squished the dough balls down a bit before baking for about 15 minutes. The cookies spread a lot more than I thought they would so I'm glad that they were placed about 2 inches apart. I actually like the flatter version more than the little mounds you see in the photos Despite the extended baking time and flat-ish shape they still came out chewy and soft and fudgy maybe a tiny bit crisp or hard on the sides. They really are brownies in cookie form:D Note: 1/4 a recipe yielded 10 cookies. I used a rounded generous tablespoon for each cookie.",
