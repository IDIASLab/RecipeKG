The skin is left on, and the reduced butter and sugar are offset with flavor-boosting bourbon, raisins, cinnamon, and lemon juice. I use Cameos for this recipe, as they are naturally sweet and hold their shape well, but if you're using a tarter variety, you may wish to increase the brown sugar and omit the lemon juice. Golden rum can substitute for the bourbon.",

The bourbon flavor was negligible, and there wasn\u2019t much syrup after the apples were cooked resulting in dry apples.  Next time, I will double the syrup ingredients (water, bourbon, butter, and brown sugar) to see if that will help.  As written, this is a pretty healthy recipe, so I hope it works for you.  I do understand my planned changes will add to fat and calories but, hopefully, not too much.  Easy, quick, and tasty recipe.",
