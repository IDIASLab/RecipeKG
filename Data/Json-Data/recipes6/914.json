This recipe would be easily adaptable to personal preferences or delicious exactly as written!\r\nAfter reheating the leftovers the next day, I HAVE to add how delicious they were! So much so that the next time I make this, I plan to cook it ahead, chill in the fridge, and then reheat it! Outstanding!!!",

I really liked the tip about soaking the noodles rather than boiling them - worked great!  Highly recommend!",
