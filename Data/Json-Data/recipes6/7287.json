Make sure to start this up to 2 days in advance, as the beans require two rounds of overnight soaking--first while raw and again once tossed into a salad. Meanwhile, you'll bake the pork belly low and slow for 7 1/2 hours for an unparalleled richness and succulence that pairs perfectly with the acidic, bracing bean salad. You can also serve these in lettuce cups.",
