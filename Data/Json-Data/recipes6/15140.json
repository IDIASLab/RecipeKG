With the help of this recipe I think I have perfected it this year (I give it as gifts every year). I never add the extra sugar-it makes it too sweet for me and those who request it from me. You can always add to the instructions that they may sweeten it to their liking. I did add a little touch of my own that made it devine this year. I tripled the recipe and added a 9.5 oz bag EACH of red hot candies and lemonheads into the mix-after mixing the rest of the ingredients. Then using a canning funnel I pack the mix into 1/2 pint pint and quart jars depending on where they are going to. SIMPLY DEVINE! This will be my Christmas Tea recipe from now on!",
