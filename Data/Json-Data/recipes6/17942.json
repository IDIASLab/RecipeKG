I made a double batch in barely more time than it took to seperate the eggs.  \n\nIf you want a pale creme, whip the yolks very well or use an electic mixer or egg beater.  To avoid glops - Be sure to use a heavy saucepan and don't turn the heat up too much.  On my stove it was about a 3.5 or 4 of 10 (electric) or else the egg will cook and congeal.  Temper the egg well and cook it slowly and you will have a rich, smooth, delicious simple version of a real creme.  And if it does get lumps, strain through a mesh sieve - no harm done, it's still yummy!",

I used this recipe to accompany a chewiest brownie recipe off this site and it turned out fabulous! I also made a raspberry syrup in addition to the creme anglais and served the brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely amazing! If your creme is turning out grainy, it means that your yolk is cooking - in this case you must use a heavier pan, and during cooking stir constantly and vigorously. You may also take your pan temporarily off the heat to stir the yolk back into smooth consistency. If all else fails, the creme can be strained before serving to eliminate the curds. Enjoy!!!",

I added some bourbon at the end of cooking it - AppleJack or Calvados works well too to give it some kick for my pumpkin bread pudding. It's fantastic and foolproof. If you screw up this recipe you obviously didn't add your hot cream to the egg mixture slow enough. I add at least half of the cream to the egg mixture slowly before adding the agg mixture back into the saucepan and it never fails. Try this!",

I am a very seasoned cook and have made creme anglaise numerous times. I know I didn't do anything wrong - it's just the recipe. I have liked other recipes better. Definitely edible though - how can you really go wrong with cream eggs and sugar?:) As for the vanilla you should never add this at the boiling stage. Always add it at the end. The only other modification I made was to add some dark rum at the end to cut some of the sweet/egg richness. Overall this was an average creme anglaise and thus my rating.",

I paired it with some chocolate crepes that were chocolately but not overly sweet and bananas and fresh fruit so it was a great combination. I also substituted fresh vanilla bean (scooped out seeds into the milk mixture and also let the bean seep in the milk) for part of the extract. I think this added a more complex vanilla flavor and you also get the bonus of the seeds dotting the creme so it looks more elegant and gives you a hint as to what is in it. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again. I also tempered very slowly and had absolutely no problems with the egg although I did strain through a fine mesh sieve just incase but there were no solids.",
