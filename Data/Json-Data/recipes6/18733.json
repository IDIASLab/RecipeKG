I made them for an Italian themed espresso and cookie night when some friends from where I lived in Padova, Italy were coming to the states to visit.  They definately passed as \"Italian\" and everyone loved how they tasted.  I was frustrated with how long they took to make and the fact that the dough was impossible to work with after being out of the fridge for even 5 minutes.  I had to keep popping it in the freezer to make it cold enough to be workable.  This added to the time-consuming aspect of the recipe.  I am going to try it again for a gallery opening event I'm going to tomorrow night, but this time I'll take the advice of other reviewers and make the cuts after the two sheets are layed on top of one another with the filling already in between.  Hopefully this will cut down the time and frustration and not take away from the pleasing taste!",

Maybe on taste they were four stars but because they were so cute I had to give them five stars. They were also really fun to make. I used cherry raspberry and peach preserves (Smuckers) I liked the raspberry ones the best because they were the most tart. I think the only thing I will do differently if I make these again is to put more filling in each one. I used just 1/4 teaspoon of filling per square like the recipe said but I found that I wanted to taste the fruit a little bit more once I actually ate them.",

It was a little messy and hard to work with so here are some simple changes that worked great on the second batch. (The key is not to touch the dough too much after it is chilled.) After the dough is mixed separate into two balls. Refrigerate for at least an hour. After dough is sufficiently chilled remove one ball from the refrigerator place between two sheets of wax paper and roll till it's fairly thin. Peel one piece of paper off this layer. Draw out a grid pattern on this layer with a knife. Don't slice through the dough; just press enough to make lines. Place 1/2 tsp of preserves or nutella in each grid section. Set aside or place back in refrigerator. Remove second dough ball from refrigerator and roll between two pieces of wax paper to same thickness as the first layer. Take one piece of wax paper off the second layer then GENTLY turn the layer over and place on top of the first layer. Remove the wax paper from the top layer. Cut the cookies between the filling plops this time cutting all the way through. GENTLY turn the cookies over and place on the greased cookie sheet. Peel off the final piece of wax paper separate cookies and seal with fork tines. Sprinkle with sugar and bake as directed. Yummy!",
