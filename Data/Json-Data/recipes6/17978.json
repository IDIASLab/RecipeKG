You definitely have to wait for it to cool and refrigerate before eating though otherwise it tastes heavily of egg. The next day I heated it up in the microwave and topped it with some vanilla ice cream. I did make some changes to make it a little less of a guilty pleasure... I used lite cream cheese lite sour cream Splenda blend sugar (half real-half not) egg white substitute (1/4 c per egg) a Heartland granola pie crust and made my own pumpkin pie spice (1/2 t cinnamon 1/4 t ginger 1/8 t allspice/cloves and 1/8 t nutmeg... per every 1 t of pumpkin pie spice needed).",
