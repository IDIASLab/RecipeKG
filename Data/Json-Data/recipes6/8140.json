I chose to use fresh green beans, which I boiled in salted water, but after this point is where it gets confusing (regardless of canned or fresh green beans). Is there supposed to be any liquid in the pot before cream cheese and butter are added, or does the water get drained off? I really wanted to love this recipe but it needs clearer instructions.",
