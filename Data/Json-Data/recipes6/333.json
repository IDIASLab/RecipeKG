Wanted them crisp on the outside and very soft on the inside. On the last 5 minutes I topped with a blend of Italian shredded cheese. The sauce: I doubled the green spices and omitted the salt. I simmered until it was thick (my total preference is thick sauce) added 1/4 cup cream cheese to temper the acidity (could have used more). I put a dollop of the sauce onto each round and pesto! Yum! Yum! I did it this way mainly for easier portion control. Once again thanks for the inspiration! PS By this time next year I will have a garden up and running and look forward to using fresh herbs and tomatoes.",
