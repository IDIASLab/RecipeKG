For those of you who are having trouble getting your preserves to set - try a larger pot. If you aren't boiling your preserves \"hard\" enough they will not set.  NEVER double the recipe and use a large pot rather than a pan.  The preserves must be a rolling boil so that they reach 220 degrees and don't stir them often.  This recipe was given to me 30 years ago by a lady who was 75 and had been given this recipe by her mother.  It works, you just have to have patience and learn how to recognize the signs that the preserves are setting.  Have fun!",

This was the recipe with which to start.  Absolutely delicious.  Easy to follow and full of flavor, this recipe tastes like my grandmother's homemade preserves.  What a treat!  The only change I made was pulsing the berries in the food processor briefly, prior to cooking.  I did so that my 14 month old could enjoy the preserves, too.",

After I had jared it and let it cool down (about 2 hrs), I could tell right then. I reopened the jars, return to pot and recooked. Basically, I started the process over. Tip#1 - Have a thermometer. Tip#2 - Keep it at a Rolling Boil for the FULL 15-20 mins. Tip#3 - Stir and Stir ans Stir.",
