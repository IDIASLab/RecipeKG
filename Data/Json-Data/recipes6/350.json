This not only tastes good, but is good for you too.  I had regular coconut on hand and used 1% milk to lighten it up a bit.  This is also great to use your favorite add-in's like a little nutmeg, raisins, dried cranberries or cherries.  Thanks for a great recipe Linda (LMT)!",

I used some half and half on top too. Lots of ways to have fun and tweak the recipe to your liking.

I love steel cut oats but it never occurred to me to try it in overnight oats. I absolutely LOVE the chewiness of the oats. This doesn't seem like it makes a lot, but it's actually quite filling. The only changes I made were to use unsweetened cashew milk (bc that's what I tend to have on hand nowadays), I used half the pecans and I used flaked coconut (larger pieces) instead of shredded. With these changes, the calorie count was 271.  I was so happy to have made this last night bc this morning I woke up late for work and otherwise wouldn't have eaten breakfast. A perfect on-to-go breakfast!  I like putting my overnight oats in small canning jars. For those who can't find unsweetened coconut, Bob's Red Mill makes some, so check that section of the store.  These oats won't get soft, so if that's what you're looking for, you're better off sticking with a cooked oatmeal recipe.",
