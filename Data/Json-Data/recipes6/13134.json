I think the reason people are having trouble with this recipe is because you have the whip the egg whites until foamy, then gradually beat in the sugar until you get a meringue. Next you fold in the walnuts and bake as directed. I got wonderful fluffy cookies following this method.",

I ended up with a huge pile of cookie mush while trying to scrap them off the Silpat. The second batch I cooked for 15-20 mins. and this was the batch that actually was ok. I had to let them cool for a while and then carefully pull them off of my Silpat with my fingers (NO SPATULAS they just make a mess). So I thought I'd try to spray my Silpats with some Pam. That resulted in two batches of extremely flat burned unicookies with major holes. Not salvageable. We did enjoy the three cookies we could eat but not worth an expensive bag of walnuts.",

I found the best approach was to try to get the paper off the cookie instead of the cookie off the paper. The completed cookies are VERY good and very fancy.
