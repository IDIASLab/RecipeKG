She lived in Michigan and would always ship them to us in Georgia every Chrismas. When I was about 12 she taught me how to make them and gave me her recipe. She died about ten years ago and since then I've been the one to make these cookies. Today Christmas Eve 2002 I went to bake the cookies for my Dad and found the recipe had been torn out of my book and is gone. It was such a relief to find this recipe here. This is her exact recipe except she didn't use nutmeg. This recipe is a wonderful recipe and the moister the batter the better the cookie. Also you CANNOT over-cook this cookie. If you do you lose the entire flavor. So bake for exactly the amount of time alloted or a little less. Thanks so much! Merry Christmas from Jill in Atlanta GA",

The flavour was pretty bland and the texture was dry even though we only cooked them for the recommended amount of time. I think the large amount of flour in the recipe may have contributed to this.
