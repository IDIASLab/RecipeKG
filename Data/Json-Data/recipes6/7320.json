I was also attracted to this recipe because it doesn't require any ice cream/froyo which I didn't have on hand. That being said.... the lack of frozen ingredients makes this shake pretty liquidy and flat - even if you use 6 ice cubes like I did. It's fine as a beverage but nothing like the milkshake consistency I was hoping for. If you want a green tea milkshake/smoothie rather than a green tea drink I think you do need to use ice cream or froyo. Alternatively maybe you could make this drink put it in an ice cube tray and then blend the frozen cubes? I might try that next time. Also I'd recommend adding some sweetener (not much - I just used 2 tsp agave nectar) to this recipe unless you used sweetened milk of some kind.",
