The only change I've ever made is to reduce the amount of water to 1 cup, and I ALWAYS use a 9x13 in pan. Works perfectly everytime, and I take home an empty pan EVERY (no exagerations!) time the past 5 years. I use 6-9 fresh peaches, and have used blueberries too. Today, I tried adding a dash of freshly grated nutmeg to the peaches. Still an excellent recipe, and the only one I go to for a cobbler! ",

I mean really, pouring boiling water over perfectly good ingredients? However I tried it anyway, halfway through I tasted the batter - it was horribly salty. My husband said bake it anyway maybe it would get better in the oven. So I proceeded per instructions. It smelled wonderful! We were all salivating over it as I pulled it out of the oven perfectly golden. I was so proud of myself. We all waited in anticipation of that first bite... SALTY!! My husband took a wopping serving determined to eat it anyway... he ate it like he had a sore tooth grimacing with every bite. Something was seriously wrong! So I went in search of the cause and THERE on the counter I discovered a completely emty salt canister, my ever helpful two year old had decided to  refill the sugar container. So my cobbler had about two cups of salt. The flies refused to land on it. *sigh* I did attempt this recipe at a later date and it was fabulous. Helpful tip: ALWAYS check the sugar before baking. :)",

I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to batter and substituted unsalted butter for the shortening. I too had to bake longer...almost 1 1/4 hours...but I'm sure that the additional peaches has something to do with the longer cooking time. This is a real keeper! Thanks Jannette for sharing!",
