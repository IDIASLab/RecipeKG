It turned out pretty good made the first one as a tester for hubby to try and then made the official one a few days later as a special treat for my brother-in-law. He loved it and said the meringue was better than his Mom made - quite a compliment. I added a tsp. of vanilla and a tsp. of margarine to the second pie and it made the custard so much tastier. Used a store bought graham cracker crust and pre-baked it. Let the custard cool for 15 mins before filling pie crust. Still had some 'seepage' a watery substance that I guess is normal for custard pies - anyone know what it is or what causes it?",
