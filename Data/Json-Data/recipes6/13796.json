With a couple modifications, this pumpkin custard pie really turned out excellent for me.  As suggested by other reviewers, I omitted the 1/2c. milk. I found that I had to stir the pumpkin about 1/2 an hour over medium heat to get it to the desired consistency. A reviewer mentioned that theirs came out thin and soupy in the middle.  I think that by cooking the pumpkin for 1/2 an hour on the stove, this problem is eliminated. I also baked my pie for 45 minutes, till the center was just slightly jiggly, and cooled the pie on a wire rack completely.  The texture is phenomenal! I couldn't ask for better. I will definitely be making this recipe many, many more times. thank you Sara for this magnificent recipe.\nYashu",
