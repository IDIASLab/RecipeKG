The cheddar is sharp, but it\u2019s mellowed out by the ricotta resulting in a mild cheesy creamy  filling that doesn't take anything away from the apple flavor.  The only thing that I would do differently in the future is cut the salt in half.  We enjoyed this both warm and cold.  Nice change  for a quick-and-easy  dessert.",

My husband loves Apple Pie with Cheddar Cheese and when I found this I knew I had to make it. I had never made a homemade pie crust before but it really kicked it up a notch. At first I was skeptical that the amount of crumb topping wouldn't be enough but as it cooked and combined with the cheese it was just right. I sprayed the top with Olive Oil non stick spray and it really helped the topping get that beautiful golden brown I was looking for. I was especially surprised that the can of pie filling was so good. Not too sweet and perfect for any occasion.",
