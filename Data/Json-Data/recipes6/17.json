I'll try the sage kind next time I'm sure that would add a nice flavor. Also I line the bottom of the loaf pan with bread slices. They soak up all the fat then you just throw the bread away when serving your meatloaf. It's a great tip I got from another reviewer. Thanks Jeffery for a delicious recipe my whole family loved it!",

To fill in for the carrots I tossed in some chopped celery and green pepper. As for the sausage, I didn't have any breakfast sausage but I did have ground pork - that and a good shot of freshly ground pepper worked fine.  I made a half recipe, one loaf, for the two of us and used the entire package of the onion soup mix.  The best part of this meatloaf in my view was the barbeque sauce and the flavor it imparted - awesome good!  Then again, the bacon on top was pretty darn good too.  One final word for this - repeat.",

I also made the traditional topping per hubs request. 1/4 Cup ketchup, 1/4 C brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp mustard. This is going to be my new standard meatloaf recipe. Thank you for sharing!",

I lightened it up quite a bit using 96/4 ground beef turkey sausage egg substitute and turkey bacon. The only thing that was missing were the extra calories! I chopped the carrots very fine since my family thinks they don't like carrots (yessir I'm a sneaky cook!) and I used 2 c. of finely ground rolled oats. I think I'll have to add about a cup or so more to the extra amount I froze since the 1st loaf did fall apart; I'm thinking is due to the egg substitute.
