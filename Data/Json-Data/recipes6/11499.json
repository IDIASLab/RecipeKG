Now being the good wife that I am (haha) I've been searching the internet and trying different eggless recipes. This is the best chocolate cake recipe we have found thus far. It is true to it's description and is very moist HOWEVER both my husband and I feel there is something lacking in the flavor; it tastes a bit bland. My husband just doesn't feel it is \"chocolatey\" (is that a word?) enough. Perhaps next time I will add a few semi-sweet chocolate squares to the batter. This recipe is a definite keeper - it just needs a tad bit of something extra.",
