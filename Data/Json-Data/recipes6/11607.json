It had way too much liquid b/w the cream corn the half/half the milk etc...I had to turn the hot dish over the sink and literally let it run. Then put back in the oven another 30 minutes. Better but not perfect. Despite the runny trouble I served to my family and they all liked the flavor (I did sub Splenda for sugar for my diabetic mom). The best was the leftovers. Once it was cold for 24hrs and had time to really stiffen up I thought it was much more delicious!",
