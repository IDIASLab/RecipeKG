My kids have each had two servings and this was because they couldn't wait until dinner. I decided to add ground cinnamon because it took the flavors to another level (I have a great strawberry bread recipe that has a lot of cinnamon in it and I was basing my decision to add on that recipe). Anyhow, the cinnamon adds a nice bit of color as well and doesn't make it as pink. Try this recipe and fall in love with it. It makes such an ample amount. I did go ahead an increase the sugar as well but did it to taste.",

The strawberries I bought were unsweetened & I had to add half a cup of sugar instead of only 2 T. For the people who said there wasn't enough sugar they most likely got unsweeted strawberries like I did. The store didn't have sweetened. No one else mentioned this but all of it didn't fit in the blender. I put it all in & after the strawberries crused it overflowed. I had to blend the rest in 2 batches. I cut up some fresh strawberries to put in the soup & topped it with a little whipped cream. The flavors really develop if you let it chill overnight. It was a nice dessert on a hot summer night.",
