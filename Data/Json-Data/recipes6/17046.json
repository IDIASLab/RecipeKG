They're firm, yet so soft in the middle, and the powdered sugar is kind of absorbed into the tops of the cookies, creating a subtle marbling effect that I really like.

I finally changed the recipe by omitting the cocoa powder/melted butter step completely. Instead I sifted the cocoa in with the dry ingredients and left out the extra 3 tablespoons of margarine. The dough was much much less sticky and gooey and much easier to roll. Instead of regular sugar I rolled ours in powdered sugar and we like the taste and texture better. For the recipe as submitted I give it 4 stars. With the minor changes it's a 5 and definitely one I'll make again and again.",

First of all when you melt 3 tbsp. margarine and mix in 1/2 cup baking cocoa powder it turns into chocolate \"glop\". I let it cool and tried to incorporate it into the other ingredients by stirring but I finally used the mixer. I will just sift the cocoa in with the dry ingredients next time. Also the dough was VERY sticky even though I left it in the fridge overnight. I had to frequently rinse my hands as they became sticky while rolling the cookies. Also make sure to put the dough in the fridge inbetween batches or it will \"melt\". The granulated sugar on the outside was...well...grainy... I tried powdered sugar for the next batch and it was much better. Finally these are good cookies inbetween a chocolate cookie and a sugar cookie. Not overly chocolatey tasting but not overly sugar cookie tasting either.",
