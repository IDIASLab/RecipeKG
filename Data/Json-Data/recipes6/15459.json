I was a little skeptical about the amount of water called for so I cut it down to 3 cups. I used 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar in my syrup mixture. My dough was really thick so instead of dropping spoonfulls into the syrup I rolled them into balls and flattened them out a little to resemble biscuts. They cooked up beautifully...and there was plenty of sauce. I would make this again just for the biscuits!! I'll definitley keep this in my recipe box. Thanks again!!",
