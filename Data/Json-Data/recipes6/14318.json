I used the pre-baked pie shell and made the cream cheese filling but I omitted the lemon rind and added 1 tsp. of maple extract to the filling. Next I sauteed the apples as in the recipe but I omitted the lemon juice and added 1 tsp. cinnamon instead. I also omitted the preserves and made a baked streusel topping that I sprinkled on top of the apples. Everyone loved it even my extra-picky son!! I'm running long here so I'm going to write down exactly what I did including the streusel topping recipe and post it to this website under the heading \"Maple Crunch Cream Pie\". Thanks for the great recipe Karen!!",

I took a previous reviewer's advice and added some cinnamon but probably should have added more. Also I used more apples than it called for and that worked out well. I made a plain regular pie crust but next time I would use something that added more flavor and crunch like a crust made from vanilla wafers or graham crackers. If you don't like lemon just skip the zest. You might consider using a little almond extract if you wanted a different flavor in the cream part or possibly some apple pie spice if you wanted a stronger flavor from the apples. I will make this again but I'll call it \"Apple-Lemon Cream Pie\" just so people aren't wondering why it tastes more like lemon than apples.",

A nice dessert after a heavy dinner. Thanks for the recipe!",
