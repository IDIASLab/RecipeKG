I made the mango salsa almost exactly as the recipe calls for - I just added a bit of cilantro to the mix. Delicious flavor! I could tell by reading the seasoning ingredients for the fish (I used tilapia, since mahi was not available at the time) that it would be too bland. I gave it a wow factor by putting the zest and juice of 1 lemon onto both sides of the fish first, and then dredging both sides of the fish in taco seasoning. I baked the fish in an oiled baking dish at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. It came out fantastic! I served it with warm taco shells, a shredded blend of Mexican cheeses, and sour cream. Yum!",

I also topped with some creme fraiche (just a dab).  This was a fun base recipe but needed some livening up.",
