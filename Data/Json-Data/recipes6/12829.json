I read the other comments regarding prolonged mixing time to dissolve the sugar and I solved that problem. I stired the sugar into the milk and just warmed it alittle stirring constantly. That dissolves the sugar quite nicely. It is importent to cool the mixture completely before adding the flour or it will lump. Follow the rest of the recipe as it is written. I used almond flavoring and it was delicous.",
