The taste is unique and a refreshing change to typical food combinations like apple crisp more like a strawberry-rhubarb cobbler than anything else. Our family loved it. With respect to the \"goopyness\" I ended up being able to cook it a little longer and evaporate a little more of the moisture out of it which produced a \"saucier\" dish. The factors contributing to this were 1)I used a larger dish so it lost more moisture from the surface and 2) I think my oven cooks a little cooler than it should. MAKE THIS DISH you'll love it. PS. It works even without the cloves I added a bit of cinnamon instead.",
