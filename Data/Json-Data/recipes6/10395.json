By mistake, I added 1/2 lb.of melted butter instead of 1/2 a cup, and over a cup of O.J., I only had to bake them longer and they still turned out great...verry moist.  I also added 1 cup or dried cranberries, and didn't add the nuts.  This is a very versatile and forgiving recipe that you can make many variations with and it will still turn out great!!  Thank you!!",
