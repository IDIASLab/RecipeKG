When I tried to get the cake out of the pan it broke apart into 4 sections.  I was in tears because I couldn't serve it on Easter the way it looked.  My husband sampled it and said it was the best carrot cake ever and I HAD to serve it...so this is what we did.  I broke the cake up into bite size cubes and layered it in a clear bowl as follows... cake pieces, drained pineapple chunks and Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting.  I repeated the layers 2 more times.  The frosting recipe is on this web site also and it is also fantastic.  It was a huge success and people asked for the recipe.  I think I'll always serve it this way from now on!!!",

All I did differently was: I added a little allspice to the flour mixture. Used only 1 cup of vegetable oil (HIGHLY reccomended - it was plenty moist) Used about 1 1/2 cups sugar (I thought it was the perfect amount of sweetness especially with the frosting..by the way my frosting had one package of cream cheese half a stick of butter 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp. orange extract. Sometimes I add orange zest too. Orange is a GREAT flavor with carrot cake.) Instead of baby food I used extra grated carrots. I reccommend adding extra carrots even if you use baby food since 1/2 cup isn't very much. Didn't put any pecans in the batter - just on top of the frosting. =) With these small changes it was definitely a 5 star cake!! ((This recipe is VERY similar to Carrot Cake III - only this one calls for baby food so I think I'm going to start using that recipe...not that this one isn't DELISH!))",
