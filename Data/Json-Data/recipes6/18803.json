I'm not sure if the orignial poster used their spritz press, but it did not work with mine.  The dough was to stiff and dry.  I even tried adding more milk and vanilla, and it still didn't work in the spritz press.  On a positive note, I rolled the dough into small balls and used a cookie stamp.  The cookies turned out pretty good that way.  The taste reminded me of brownies...definately something the kids love as does my husband.  I will make this cookie again, but would have to experiment with maybe less flour if using a spritz press.",

After reading all of the reviews I added a full teaspoon of vanilla and an extra egg to compensate for the dryness that everyone spoke of. But found that it wasn't thick enough at all so added more flour! I finally decided that it wasn't the thickness that's the problem but the stickiness. So I added a couple more tablespoons of margarine and it worked perfectly. I think that the recipe as it stands would work best if just more margarine/shortening was added. They pressed our perfectly for me after that and are delicious like spritz brownies!",
