I have baked and decorated lots of cakes, and although this icing was pretty, and white/white, it was totally tasteless.  I even added 2x the vanilla after making it, but it didn't help.  I would probably add some butter extract next time. Also, the recipe calls for salt, but doesn't include it in the directions.  Piped well. Not a bad recipe if you're looking for that grocery-store no-taste icing.  Texture is there. I'll stick to buttercream. I find it is way more flavorful and if you add 3Tbls. of Karo clear syrup to a buttercream, it spreads and smoothes better than this.\n\np.s. Don't overmix the last addition of powdered suger in this recipe or it tends to curdle the satin-smooth consistency a bit. Do just like it says, only mix til blended.",

I have tried at least 20 other \"white icing\" recipes-and this one has the best taste consistency etc. If you are looking for that \"bakery cake\" icing for birthday cakes middle of sandwich cookies cupcakes etc.--try this one! Couple of notes--Did taste a little \"almondy\" first time I made it so reduced the almond to 1/8th tsp. Be SURE to beat it the first time for at least the 5 minutes--that will get rid of the \"shortening\" feel. It's a huge recipe-if you aren't frosting and decorating a large sheet cake-you may want to half it. Also--if you don't want it to taste like a \"buttercream\" icing (which I did not)--do NOT use any butter or butter flavored shortenings. Thanks SOOO much Cherie!!",

Generally for this amount of fat, whether it's shortening or butter, I prefer a ratio of 1 cup butter or shortening to four cups of powdered sugar.  This recipe was TWICE that amount of sugar, but I wanted to give it a try. I used an egg white for part of the water called for and eliminated the almond extract just as a matter of preference.  I kept adding the sugar but finally stopped at 7-1/2 cups, thinking \"enough is enough.\"  This frosting is beautiful, fluffy and elegant white and even tho' just a wee bit sweet for my tastes (others, like my husband, would disagree on that point) it tasted pretty darn good too - but keep in mind that when I make any shortening type frosting I use hi-ratio shortening, which makes an incredible difference in taste, mouth feel, consistency and stability.  This is frosting I'd be quite confident to use again, even tho' it's a little different than I'm used to.",
