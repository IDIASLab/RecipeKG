I also forgot the thyme, which would've added some much needed flavor to the recipe.  Finally, I used rehydrated dried minced onion instead of fresh, because I don't like fresh onions.  Well, if you don't like onions, just leave them out, don't use dried.  WITHOUT my changes, I think this would've been pretty tasty!",
