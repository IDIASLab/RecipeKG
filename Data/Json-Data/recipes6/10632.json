I use 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, and I ommit (usually) the pecans.  Takes a little longer to cook with the extra banana's, but it's worth the wait.\r\n\r\nThanks Pam Hall",

I added 1TB vanilla because usually like more than recipes call for. It turned out great, except next time I will add some spices to the mix, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice. I will also mix up a small dish of cinnamon and sugar with melted butter and spread on the top of the bread. It was good, but it needs a little kick. Adding a little more banana couldnt hurt either.",

I've never made banana bread with cream cheese before so this was a nice change plus it was a nice way to use up the last of it along with some really ripe bananas. I cut the recipe in half and added a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and kept the vanilla at 1 tsp. I also mashed 3 ripe bananas so that was definitely more than 1/2 cup! I subbed walnuts for the pecans as that's what I had on hand. I used one egg and added a couple of tbsp. of veg. oil. I baked in a 9x5 glass baking dish and it took an hour. I love the nice nut/sugar mixture in the middle when you cut into the bread - delish!",

If you do to, here is what I changed to make it perfect:  For the bread I dropped the white sugar to 3/4 cups and added 1/2 cups brown sugar.  \nTo the filling: I doubled the amounts and used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/8 c. white sugar, 1 1/4 c. finely chopped pecans, 4 tsp. cinnamon, and 3 T BUTTER.  I used a pastry cutter to mix it until coarse and crumbly.  I sprinkled a little around the greased pan.  Then I put 1/2 in the middle of the batter and 1/2 on the top of the loaf.  It came out sooooo delicious!  More like banana coffee cake...  but oh, so good!  I brought it to a party and it disappeared instantly!  This has become my permanent recipe!",
