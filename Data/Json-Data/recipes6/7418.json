Then I add the kimchi and kimchi brine. Also instead of using water I use chicken broth. When it's almost done I chop up tofu and throw it in the pot. Let it boil for a couple of minutes and it's all done and delicious! (I use the medium tofu - not the soft or hard)",

Don't forget adding minced ginger and garlic. This gives a great flavor to the soup.   ",
