I just eyeballed the amount of oil but I know I didnt use 1/3 of a cup thats too much. I probably went a little heavier on the garlic and feta too. I just put my onions in fresh not with the hot water over them. Going to try with red onions next time. Ive made this twice in the past week and it doesn't stay around long!",
