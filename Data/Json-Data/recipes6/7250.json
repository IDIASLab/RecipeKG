Was a bit on the sweet side for us (personal taste), so I did add a LOT MORE of the chili garlic sauce to balance it out.  Also, I was concerned that all water would weaken the flavor, so I used half water and half beef stock (would do that again), and I used the white mushrooms I had in the fridge instead of shiitakes.   I used Angus Beef sirloin cut into cubes, and in about 1-1/4 hours, the beef was very tender. It was pretty watery, so I did add some Wondra\u00ae to thicken to more of a sauce consistency, and served with rice.  This was a real hit, and seriously, tasted like something you\u2019d be served in a nice restaurant.  Camille, thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a definite keeper.",
