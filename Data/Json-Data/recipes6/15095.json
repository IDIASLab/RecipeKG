The rest of the family was suspicious because the combination of ingredients seemed so unfamiliar. Everyone was very pleasantly surprised by the wonderful complex flavor. Very easy to make the pie had the consistency of other cream pies e.g. Banana Cream Coconut Cream. I had thought of leaving off the meringue but that would have been a mistake-the brown sugar added a warm flavor note to offset the tang. My modifications: I reduced sugar to 3/4C(just because) and raisins to 3/4C.",

Plus since it's a brown sugar meringue it smells absolutely divine! I'm giving this recipe 4 stars since I knew beforehand that the nutmeg called for would likely overpower the pie. I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves and cinnamon. Perfect!",
