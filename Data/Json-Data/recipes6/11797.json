Macadamia nuts, totally make either these or chocolate chip cookies!\r\n\r\nThese cookies ended up nice and crunchy, without being crumbly. The amount of flour is Critical! I tried it with an 1/8-cup more flour, and the cookies were too hard, and too dry. So make sure you use 3/4 cup, and tap it down.\r\n\r\nThe recipe doesn't really make 48 cookies...more like 36, but that's okay. Just double it. You'll end up eating them all in 10 minutes anyway. :-)\r\n\r\nExcellent recipe, for a novice oatmeal cookie person.  By the way, nowadays, I borrowed from the pros, and make the dough-drops, putting them real close on a cookie tin, then freezing them. Take the frozen dough balls and stick them in a bag, and voila! you have fresh cookies whenever you want. I usually end up adding about 5 minutes to the baking time, if the dough's frozen.",

Even my husband who says he only really likes chocolate chip cookies liked these. I used my #50 cookie scoop and got only one dozen 3\" (approx.) cookies. I did bake for 12 minutes and we ate them while still a little warm. They were nice and chewy in the middle and lightly crisp on the edges. I couldn't tell you how they tasted the next day because we ate all 12 in one evening:) I can't imagine getting 48 cookies out of this amount of batter - if you do they would be awfully tiny and the baking time would have to be drastically reduced. This recipe was very similar to the Vanishing Oatmeal Raisin Cookies on my box of oats. There are just very minimal differences with one of them being the ingredients are doubled what is called for in this recipe and that one says it makes 4 dozen cookies also. I wonder if the yield of 4 dozen stated in the recipe is a misprint? No matter the size they were very good!",
