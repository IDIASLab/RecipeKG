A couple of notes for the readers having trouble: remember that anything thickened with cornstarch MUST come to a boil to get the full thickening power. It really just will not work otherwise. Look for your pudding to have big bubbles forming and then it's good and cooked fully. Also, for 4 egg whites, I use 1 cup of sugar. This was a very tasty recipe and no preservatives or additives like with packaged puddings!",

I stirred it while cooking with my wire whisk...cooking until very thick.  I also used 2 bananas, one layer over the bottom of the pie, then half the custard filling, one more banana and then the rest of the filling.  The meringue, I added a pinch of baking powder along with the cream of tartar, it kept it from shrinking away from the edge (something I\"ve always had problems with). I used the regular sugar for the meringue.  I will most definitely make this pie again, thank you for a wonderful recipe!!! I have also used just coolwhip on the top of this pie after cooled or when serving. Absolutely delicious!",
