I love pecan pie, but most of the time it's so daunting to make.  This is easy, and you can always use pecans in place of the walnuts.  And my crust turned out perfectly.  Just get in there with your hands and really mush it together.  Make sure to let them sit for awhile either at room temperature or in the fridge.  Miss impatient me had to grab a piece 30 minutes after they came out.  Tasted amazing, but was a little runny.  I put the rest in the fridge for two hours and they were fantastic.

It's basically a lemon bar crust with walnut filling. I've also experimented with different toppings: whip cream or a small drizzle of hot fudge or caramel are quite tasty too.",

Since these were her childhood favorites I had to make these for her. And boy I was glad I did make them. I love these so much they became my childhood favorite (I'm a teenager by the way)! Oh My! This is what paradise and warm hugs taste like. Though my Chinese Chews were a different it wasn't really a bar it didn't hold well like the picture. Since that happen we scooped parts of it and plopped it on ice cream and it hit the spot perfectly. Cannot wait to make this delicious-ness again!",
