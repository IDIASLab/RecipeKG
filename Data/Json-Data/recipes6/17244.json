I used whole wheat white flour and I did not add the full amount of salt a heaping teaspoon was plenty for me. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes (this dough did need a little more flour than what was called for to get the dough to form a solid ball and stop sticking to the bottom of the mixer bowl) then set it to rise for an hour in a greased covered bowl. After it doubled I formed rolls using my 1/3 cup measuring cup and plopped them into greased muffin tins covered it with saran wrap and let them double again. Baked at 400 these were done in just under 14 minutes. I brushed them with oil straight out of the oven. GINORMOUS rolls. Really. They were huge. The flavor was very nice and the rolls were not too sweet but also fluffy and chewy.",

First, I had to halve the recipe so it would fit in my machine. I used a little over a cup of warm water instead of using the boiling water. I used all whole wheat flour instead whole wheat and bread flour.  Then I just adding everything in the order suggested by my bread machine instructions, set it to the \"dough\" cycle, and then followed steps 4 and 5 from the recipe. The rolls turned out really tasty, light, and fluffy. :)",
