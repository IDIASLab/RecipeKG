These cookies are amazing and now I can't keep them on the shelf.  After they have cooled I dip the entire top into a milk and powdered sugar glaze.  I allow that to dry overnight and this seals the moisture into the cookie.  Thanks for sharing this formula.",

I'd definetely go with real cranberries - it's such an interesting, tangy taste that you don't get too often and the real cranberries look GORGEOUS in the cookies.  I felt the craisins got lost in the cookies and you didn't taste them as much.\r\n\r\nAlso, I did half a teaspoon of cinammon, half pumpkin pie spice.  And per someones recommendation I sprinkled cinammon on top of the cookies - nice touch.  I didn't have walnuts - used hazelnuts which were fine, but I'm betting walnuts would go better.  Sometimes you make pumpkin cookies and you don't taste the pumpkin - you do here.  You could even serve these along with your Thanksgiving meal instead of as a dessert if you were so inclined.",

                "reviewBody": "These cookies are attractive, moist and delicious -- the perfect fall cookie.  The fresh cranberries elevate the cookie to something truly different, perfectly tart.  I'd avoid Craisins -- they are neither as pretty, moist nor tart.  I sweetened the cookies and boosted the flavor with a 1/2 cup shredded coconut (if you don't like coconut, I'd add 1/4 cup of brown sugar) and added 1/8 tsp. of cloves and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also substituted pecans because I prefer the taste to walnuts.  I found there was no good substitute for the orange zest -- it adds a tremendous amount of flavor.   Lastly, I drizzled the cooled cookies with powdered sugar mixed with milk, vanilla and cinnamon.  Note that because much of the moistness of these cookies comes from pumpkin rather than butter or brown sugar, these cookies do not spread.  As a result, round balls of dough will yield puffed golfball/haystacks as noted by another reviewer.  To avoid this, when rotating my cookies at the halfway point of baking, I quickly flatten them down with a spatula (much easier than trying to flatten down sticky raw dough).  By the time they finish baking, they are nicely puffed but in the traditional round, flat shape of a cookie.  ",

I like that I can taste the flavors of both the pumpkin and cranberry in this recipe. The sweetness is not overpowering just enough. I'm a cookie maker and this will definitely be added to my list of \"go to\" cookies. I did substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour (for health) and concentrated frozen OJ for the orange zest because I was too lazy to zest the orange. Also I used my food chopper to chop the cranberries in batches. Not only was this easier but the cranberries were more even distributed throughout the cookie. Still YUMMY!!! In the last 12 of the batch I added white morsels to trick my youngest daughter into eating them -- these were great too; still not too sweet. I already told my mom she needs to make these too.",
