Looking over the recipe, it appeared the blueberry flavor was going to be lost in orange, almond and cinnamon - TOO much going on here - and for me, these were competing rather than complementary flavors as well.  I reduced the orange juice by half (while at the same time reducing the cornstarch to  compensate) and it still had more orange flavor than I would have preferred for a BLUEBERRY sauce.  I eliminated the almond extract and cinnamon altogether.  Finally, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the sauce was plenty sweet - an extra quarter cup would have been cloyingly sweet. So...by eliminating the cinnamon and almond extract, and reducing the amounts of both the sugar and the orange juice this would be greatly improved - but then it wouldn't be this recipe.",
