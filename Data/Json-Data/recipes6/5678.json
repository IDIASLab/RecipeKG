I used a frozen bag of mixed vegetables added some minced fresh garlic and used the optional cream of mushroom soup. I thought it was good but just felt like it was lacking something. My husband didn't like it at all. He said it was very bland. I think it was because of the brown gravy mix. Next time I'll try it with beefy onion soup mix and water instead of the beef broth and gravy mix. I'll also thaw the frozen vegetables and add them at the end so they don't get mushy and washed out looking.",
