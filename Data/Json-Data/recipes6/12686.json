I went ahead and tried it anyways because I am a sucker for recipes with less ingredients. Less ingredients = more cookies for my family. The \"bland\" taste everyone is talking about is really not bad. It makes the cookie just right after you frost it. I even sugar coated a batch before cooking them and they tasted great also. I did experiece the Crumble effect while mixing the ingredients together. Don't add more sour cream water or liquid. Use your hands to mix it till you form dough. I chilled the dough for about an hour before I used it. Turned out GREAT. Easy to cut cookies out of. I rolled them to about 1/4 of an inch they didn't puff way out and they did hold the shapes well. I would recommend this recipe to everyone. This one is a keeper!!!!",

They completely held their shape and baked up to become tender little morsels of rich cookie goodness! I even went all out and decorated each cookie with homemade buttercream frosting. All in all it was a big hit at work as well as at home. NOW i am getting constant requests for these tasty little sugar cookies. Enjoy!",
