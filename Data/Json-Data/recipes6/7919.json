The portion size is small since this recipe makes 6 servings, but it's so thick and creamy that I was fully satiated.\n\nI substituted white onion for the shallots since I didn't have any on hand, and powdered garlic for the garlic granules. \n\nI also did one more step of pureeing the soup in my magic bullet after it was cooked. I definitely recommend that if you like a creamier texture, and even the taste of the broccoli blends better into the soup.",

I added a boullion cube for a bit more flavor other than that it was made as written. I did simmer the soup for about 10 minutes as I needed the fresh broccoli to soften. And I didn t have xantham gum so I served it as is which made it a thin soup but the cream and butter and cheese make it VERY satisfying.",
