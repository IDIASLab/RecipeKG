My pie turned out way way too sweet! Actually it is to the point of being almost inedibly and sickly sweet. I even used 2 more cups of gooseberries as my pie plate is a large one and the amount of sugar was still too much. I like a pie that is sweet but also retains a bit of tartness from the berries and I am sorry to say that this is definitely not it. If I were to make again I would reduce the sugar drastically because as it is now it completely ruined my hard-picked berries. update: In addition to the horrible sweetness of this pie the filling never set either. I thought a day in the fridge would fix it but it didn't and I wound up having to tip my pie over the sink to drain out all the liquid. Luckily for me the crust recipe I use yields a sturdy base that didn't go mushy on me otherwise I would have had to throw the whole thing away. I hate the pie but my husband has taken on eating it because neither of us is very keen on wasting valuable time effort and ingredients. I had given this 2 stars but now it's definetly a 1... should be a zero though.",

I suppose it will depend on how ripe your gooseberries are. My parents have their own bushes so mine were very ripe and very sweet. In my situation 1 cup of sugar would have been enough. I would advise between 1 cup sugar for very sweet very ripe berries to 1.5 cups for tart firm berries. Otherwise nice simple recipe loved the pie. The filling is typically thick for a fruit pie. If you like yours more congealed toss in an extra Tbls of tapioca. Final remark - depending on how you like your pies done you may want to add 5 minutes to bake time.",
