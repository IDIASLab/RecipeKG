I tried many things and these are surprisingly close to good-old Toll House&reg; cookies, but with no grain and less sugar! These are much better than typical gluten-free cookies as they do not have the sandy texture that so often plagues gluten-free baking. If you have to be grain- or gluten-free, give these a try for an occasional naughty treat that you remember!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe yields a very good cookie-a keeper for the recipe book indeed. The texture is not the usual almond flour texture thanks to the coconut flour. It is chewy but not overly. It melts in your mouth but is still crunchy outside. With my first batch the cookies spread out over the baking sheet cooked in 6 minutes almost burning on the bottom but not the top. This left me with a delicious very flat very large cookie even though I put the batter in the fridge for about 10 minutes. I tried a second batch using 25% less butter freezing the batter about 10 minutes and weighing each cookie before baking to ensure each cookie was the same size (approx. 23 grams before cooking). I added a picture of both to show the difference but both were very tasty. With batch 2 I had tall cookies that look like muffins-but don't doubt it-these were cookies! Almost like mom used to make if mom had baked with almond flour and coconut flour. They held their shape cooked in 8 minutes and tasted like heaven. I also turned down the temperature to 165 C on the second batch. Thank you Christine Rogers for sharing your recipe.",
