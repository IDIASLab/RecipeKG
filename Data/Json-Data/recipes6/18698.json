I used 1/2 cup of orange juice which gave the dough more flavor. The first time I made them I used 1/4 of orange juice and the cookies were too bland for us. Icing - First time I used lemon flavor as the recipe calls for. Second time I used butter creme or chocolate. They tasted like mini cupcakes that way. Which my kids loved.",

It isn't an orange or lemon cookie that is why it isn't called an orange or lemon cookie. It is essentially a sugar cookie with a hint of other flavors and I thank you so much for sharing it so I don't have to!:)",
