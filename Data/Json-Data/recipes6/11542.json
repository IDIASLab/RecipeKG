I made it exactly as stated in the recipe except I used 2 tsp. of sugar in the shortdough crust and I did not include the lemon zest in the almond paste filling. It looked really pretty on the plate dusted with powdered sugar. I think it needs the powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness. Two of my three kids loved it and so did I. The texture was wonderful. It is not meant to be a traditional \"cake\" and the texture is smooth and creamy with the yummy crust beneath. The only thing I can think to improve this would be to use a tart pan instead of a springform pan (it would be prettier in presentation) and perhaps to top the filling with sliced almonds prior to baking. This woul give it a very pretty top and add some texture (if you like that) to the creamy filling.",

I suspect the cooking temperature and time were off. A similar recipe for this cake (Mazarin Cake II)had the temperature set for 400 F. I will not be making it again and suggest others look for a different recipe.",
