I can count on one hand the number of times the snow was clean enough to make snow ice cream.  It's almost worth moving to a part of the country that gets more snow because boy is it good stuff!  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.",

But I use just milk sugar vanilla and snow. Tastes great. Also regular milk works fine if you don't have evaporated milk. As for clean snow when it starts snowing a good fluffy snow coming straight down we put a large pan outside to catch clean snow. If there's 4-6 inches on the ground you can skim off the top. Don't try to use a blowing snow or snow that's been on the ground a couple of days. You need a dry fluffy snow.",
