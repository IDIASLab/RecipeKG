That's the only reason for four stars instead of 5.\nI added lemon zest to the batter; then drizzled a lemon juice/sugar solution over the fresh-out-of-the-oven cake and the lemon flavour was still very subtle.  However, that being said, this is still an excellent pound cake and I won't hesitate to use this recipe again.  \n\nBy the way, I didn't cut in the butter as per instructions. I creamed the butter with sugar & egg, added the extracts, then added the dry ingredients alternately with the milk.  Took about 50 minutes until done.",

It took over an hour and a half to cook, not 30 minutes. The crumb was uneven in many places as well as flavors. And of course the crust was hard as a rock, but amazingly despite the 1hr 45 min cooking time , the inside was moist. I was forced to make a glaze because the cake isn't sweet enough.  The Glazed Lemon Bundt Cake is much better.  All that said...  I wish people on this site would rate recipes only if they've actually used it as is. Frankly I am tired of people listing the dozen or so changes that they make to a recipe then giving it 4 or 5 stars!",

However this loaf took MUCH longer than 1/2 hr to cook more like an hour. It rose nicely in the oven but when I took it out it fell considerably and became a condensed lemon puck! I think it might have something to do with the cutting in of the butter and not creaming the sugar and butter together?? What other cake/loaf recipie cuts in butter? Too many changes are needed to make this recipie worthwhile - I would suggest trying another.",

I also used cake flour (made the cake light and fluffy) but had no lemon essence so used one lemon and some zest of the lemon. This may not have been enough lemon for me but as I also made a lemon syrup to pour on the cake straight after it came out of the oven (see previous reviews), this really zinged up the lemon flavour. It was GREAT!!! and I will definitely make this cake again and again!",
