I liked the flavor that the brown sugar brings to this recipe but this was just a little too sweet for us. In the future I will reduce the brown sugar to 1 tsp and saut\u00e9 some chopped onion in the bacon fat to add to the beans. Small thing but melt your butter first stir in the brown sugar and then add your drained beans and crumbled bacon. We like butter beans but they're something that I seldom think about serving on their own as a side dish but we enjoyed them with pork chops.",
