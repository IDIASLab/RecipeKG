Here are the tips that helped make it the best and easiest: use parchment paper so that it comes out of the pan easier, put each layer into the freezer to harden so that it speeds up the wait time, present the candy in cupcake cups, and use butterscotch chips in only one of the layers--I put it only in the bottom layer because it has a very dominating flavor.  I substituted 1/4 C. choc. chips for the butterscotch in the top layer.  Remember that a 7 oz. jar of marshmallow cream = 1 1/2 C.  I warmed this in the microwave first so that it came out easier.  This isn't something you want to make when time or patience is limited, but I hope these tips make it a little easier!  Oh, have I mentioned that this is delicious?!",

Just a few notes to help save time:  A 7 oz. jar of marshmallow creme is 1 1/2 cups, and I microwaved the carmel and cream in a microwave safe bowl with great results.  Just be sure to heat it on medium heat and stir frequently until melted and smooth.  I must agree that the carmel does ooze out of the rest of the layers-I'll try the mini muffin cups.  Also, I thought the top and bottom layers tasted too much like butterscotch-I'll omit the butterscotch chips next time and substitute additional milk choc. chips.",

I read about everyone's trouble with the caramel layer, so here is what I did: I melted the caramels in the microwave with 2 tbsps of milk, stirring every 30 seconds to one minute. (It only takes about 2-3 minutes to melt them) and then spread them on top of the nut layer. I have had no problems with the layers sliding apart or the caramel oozing. I hope this helps!",

I make caramel in the crockpot take how ever many cas of sweetend condensed milk you desire and put it in the crockpot(yes the unopened can) and then fill with water until it covers the cans.cover with lid. Cook on low for 10 hours.I make several cans at a time then stick them in my fridge until I am ready to use best caramel.I had no problems with this caramel sliding off. It is thick.
