Although it was tasty I couldn't bring myself to not add cinnamon - which was how this recipe was written. I would also take up the advice of other reviewers and double the amount of crumb mixture as 1/2 cup was not nearly enough. Overall I would say this cake could be used as a good base with different toppings and the like but not an excellent crumb case in iteself.",

Self rising flour contains 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt per cup so I also thought about omitting an egg.....and it worked! I only had 2 eggs on hand so I splashed sommore milk in there. I used another tsp of butter with the shortening that I added only to the crumbs. I also added a little cinomman/ sugar mixture to the crumb and a little less to the cake. I only added enough for a hint of flavor to tie it all together do not make cinomman the main flavor. Overall great and easy.",
