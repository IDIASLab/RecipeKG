Mine didn't set up very well and was a bit runny but the next day the left overs had just the right amount of \"body\" to it. The taste was very good and both my wife and I had seconds. We don't care for bell peppers so I used a red onions instad. That added color and taste. I suggest you melt the butter in the microwave before trying to mix it with the corn in step two. I will use a little more flour next time to give it a little more body. The beaten egg whites are what makes this so special. Thanks for the recipe Erika!",
