I wasn't real sure what to do about the shortening - it says to mix it in but after adding liquid in order to \"mix\" it in it would have to be melted and the recipe didn't call for that. I just used half a stick of unsalted butter and half a cup of shortening and cut it into the flour mixture BEFORE adding the yeast water and buttermilk like a traditional biscuit recipe. One thing I would have done differently is warm the milk up a bit cold liquids tend to shock the yeast. I also would have placed these biscuits closer together. They spread out a lot but were still fluffy. I scooped the \"gloopy\" dough onto a liberally floured surface liberally sprinkled more flour on top and pressed the dough out gently with my hands. I cut the biscuits out of that and transferred them quickly to the sheet since they are very pliable. These were great. Someone mentioned more salt I suggest using margarine or salted butter to brush the tops of them when they come out seems to add the perfect touch. Perfect for eating with honey too!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is awesome. I love that you do not have to let them rise. I have been baking for over 20 yrs. and I won a blue ribbon for my biscuits in the 5th grade 4H club. Even the teachers wanted my recipe. I made a few adaptations myself. Here's how to make them easy and PERFECT... For starters use self-rising flour and omit the baking soda and baking powder. You just do not need them. Add extra salt more or less to your taste but definitely add more salt. I also added extra sugar 1/2 cup to be exact add to your liking. Warm milk (not HOT) to keep from shocking the yeast. Yeast needs warmth...especially since you don't let these rise. I also used 2 sticks butter (or margarine) instead of the shortening. The difference is that shortening tends to make biscuits a bit lighter than butter but with this recipe you don't have to worry about it. As a matter of fact the butter gives it a better flavor and helps it to hold together better. They are very gloppy as stated so all you have to do is add an extra cup of flour. You will still need to flour your board good. Dough should be wet when you put it on flour. Gently roll adding flour as needed to avoid getting pin or hands all doughy but without overdrying. Dough should be very soft and pliable. Cut with round cutter or shape into 1/2 inch thick biscuits. Place barely touching but make sure they touch. Dough will not spread out if you add the extra flour and make sure they touch. Make sure you us",

                "reviewBody": "My family loved these biscuits. I used the ingredients as written but I prepared them a little different. First, cut in the shortening before you add the buttermilk and yeast mixture. Also, warm the buttermilk before you add it. It says it does not need to rest, which may be true, but you will get a lighter biscuit if you allow it to rise, covered in a draft-free place for at least 30 minutes. I allowed mine to rise for 45 minutes. Make sure you place your biscuits slightly touching so they rise in the oven nicely. I also brushed them with melted, salted butter right after they came out of the oven. They turned out wonderful. They also freeze very well. To freeze, before the rise time, put some bisuits on a cookie sheet lined with wax or parchment paper for about 30 minutes. When frozen, store in freezer bags. Whenever you want biscuits for dinner, take out however many you want an hour before baking, then bake at 400* for 10 to 12 minutes. Will make these again and again.",

As soon as I add the shortening I get in there with my hands and rub the shortening into the flour by rubbing my hands together. I count off 37 seconds ( a little trick I got from Alton Brown). It is true what they have been saying as far as the dough being 'gloppy'. As soon as the dough looks mixed together I pour the mixture into a zip lock bag and snip the corner off like a pastry bag. I then squeeze biscuit sized portions onto a greased pan and bake. Works perfect every time. The old 'biscuit rule' applies here - You want to handle biscuits as little as possible. Another nice thing about the zip lock method is that you can squeeze out as much as you like and then put the bag back in the fridge for fresh biscuits another day.",
