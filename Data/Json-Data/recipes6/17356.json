I was only doing a trial run to see how this cake would be for my grandma's 90th birthday so I kindof rushed along and the cake was still warm when I was working so that could've been the problem. I did not use the 7min icing recipe..I found another buttercream recipe from this site that is very good...so I decided to use that instead.",
