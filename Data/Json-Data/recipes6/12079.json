Next 3 batches I did the fork dipped in Splenda thing, and the results were delightful. I doubled recipe and it made 4 large trays of smallish cookies.\r\nHAVE A DRINK NEARBY- our cookies needed a chaser!\r\n~Guido's Wife",

                "reviewBody": "These cookies are 5-star cookies when made right. I gave the recipe 4 stars for lack of specificity. There are a few things that need to happen for these cookies to be delicious.\n\n1. Use the right kind of peanut butter. Natural peanuts-only peanut butter just won't give the right consistency or flavor. Use a conventional peanut butter or a no-stir natural one (the kind with palm oil added for emulsification). \n\n2. Add a little salt, ESPECIALLY if your peanut butter is unsalted. This makes a world of difference in flavor.\n\n3. Be sure to use a large or extra-large egg. \n\n4. Use less sugar! This goes along with #3 above. Too much sugar in a recipe will cause the egg not to set which leads to a runny mess on your cookie sheet. 3/4 cup of sugar is more than enough to make the cookies super sweet but still allows the egg to set properly.\n\nIf you take all these things into account, these cookies will knock your socks off! I used crunchy peanut butter, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, a pinch of salt and one large egg and I was SO in love with these. In fact, I liked them WAY more than conventional peanut butter cookies. These are peanut butter heaven.",
