Minutes, no, hours passed, and low and behold, here in my very own hands I held, yes, I, that is me, Guido, I, Guido, held my very own Selkirk Bannock! For the flavor I added little cherry-tomatoes as eyes and a pecan as a puckered lip (hehe, made me laugh to look at him). Anyhow, I later cut a piece of him with my favorite knife (which I like to call the \"Galleto\"), brought it to my lips, and touched it to my tongue. The flavor was of vinegar; the flavor was of salt; the flavor was of pure white sugar which I ground from the cane this morning; the flavor... was beautiful! I can verily understand why the Queen would have but nothing else with her tea!",
