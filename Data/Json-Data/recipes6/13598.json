                "reviewBody": "This one of our favorites!  However, we use one stick of butter melted and THEN cooled to room temperature. If you put hot melted butter into this recipe it will melt your chips and then they will sink to the bottom. Also, I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, just like a regular chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for. This gives it a little more of a chocolate chip cookie taste. I also use 3 eggs to give it a lighter consistency. Remember to blend the eggs until foamy before adding the other ingredients. To make it even easier I use a Pillsbury pie crust. The crust seems to absorb some of the butter and comes out fairly crispy, much more so than a homemade crust. Bake at 325 for 50 minutes. I have been playing around with this recipe for a few years and think I pretty much have it perfected by now. Put this in the oven just before you sit down to dinner and by the time you are ready for dessert it should be out and cooled enough to serve!  It is always a huge hit! ",

                "reviewBody": "The flavor of this pie is great it definitely tastes like its namesake. However I think the recipe needs some modifications. My crust was nearly burned by the time the filling was set (1 hour 15 minutes) and it was saturated with butter. Also my chocolate chips were melted into a solid layer at the bottom not bits throughout the filling. Next time I will tke the advice of a previous reviewer who says they used 1/2 cup of butter. I will have to experiment to figure out how to get the filling done without an overdone crust. I think the filling could stand up to 350 degrees so that may be the solution. Also I think it doesn't have to be set all the way to the center before removal from the oven. The filling exactly fit a deep dish frozen pie crust (Marie Callendar's).",
