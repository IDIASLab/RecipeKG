If you try this receipe for the first time, don't be discouraged by the strong an unusual smell of the ammonia. It makes the cookies puff up during the baking process. That's where its name comes from. Translated it means \"little jumper\". Ammonia is a must for those cookies, otherwise you will have Anise cookies. The smell will disapear over time and the strong flavor of anise will rise. Enjoy.",

I found that the dough could be chilled for longer periods with consistent results for busy cooks. I used a cat cookie cutter as I do not have any molds; the cut cookies \"rested\" overnight on parchment paper for easy removal. Also I used a spray mister to quickly wet the backs before placing on a greased and seeded sheet. My friends wholeheartedly shared in my enthusiasm by exclaiming how exceptional the \"puffy cats\" were which caused the need for multiple double batches! Will get online to purchase down molds for next year. It was the highlight of my Christmas thank you very very much!",

Its too easy to lose detail in your design if you brush them before they bake and the flour on them won't cause any problems. It brushes right off after the cookies cool.",

I got the recipe from a wonderful German Lutheran friend who made them for our bridge group and for the church's Cookie Bazaar every Christmas. These days she's spends Christmas with the angels leaving it to me to make these cookies in her memory! Store these in airtight containers for the very best flavor! Great dunking cookies! One technique suggestion - After rolling a batch of dough out with a rolling pin I trim it to the width of my Springerle mold (mine is the rolling pin kind) and sprinkle the anise seed on my work surface (under the dough) so that it sticks to the bottom of the dough as I press the design into the cookies. This eliminates the need to spray the cookies with water to get the seeds to stick at baking time!",
