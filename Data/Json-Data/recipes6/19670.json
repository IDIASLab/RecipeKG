I even added some chopped pecans/walnuts to the cake mix the 3rd time.  With and without nuts were a hit with both coworkers and family.  I'll be making this for our Thanksgiving gathering this year.

(2) I use cinnamon pumpkin pie spice (or allspice) and a 1/2tsp of powdered ginger. (3) I use regular whole milk instead of evaporated milk (though I bet the evaporated is better and I will try that next time) and...(4) I bake and serve the cake in a ceramic dish--no turning it out or inverting. Just remove it from the oven and put the whipped topping on after it cools and just before serving. In my opinion this recipe is very \"personalize-able.\" There are a lot of variations out there but the basic recipe is the same in all of them. It kicks regular pumpkin pie in the patootie and everyone will love you for making it.",

If you're serving a crowd this can definitely go farther for less effort than traditional pie. In an effort to increase the nutrition factor by just a little bit I cut the white sugar to 3/4 c. and I thought it was plenty sweet enough since the cake mix and butter layer is pretty sweet on its own. I think next time I'll even omit a tablespoon or two of butter and my guess is I'll not notice the difference.",
