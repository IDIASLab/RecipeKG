Also curious is how a submitted recipe is altered by some cooks and then given a bad review. Having said that, I made this just as written (half recipe) in a mini egg shape pan from Williams Sonoma (eight to the pan). SO good! Fragrant, dark, moist, luscious little dark chocolate cakes. I used \"Hard Chocolate Glaze\" (also fabulous) to dip them in, then made a bakery style creamy white frosting to decorate them. These were to die for! Tasted like an infinitely better version of Hostess cupcakes! In fact, I could easily see this made in a cupcake tin to duplicate them near exactly. I know I will definitely use this recipe (with the glaze) again--and again--and again. All around, an easy to mix cake that yields perfect results! ",

Here's the trick: instead of water, heat up 2 c milk, add 2 heaping teaspoons of instant coffee and use that to dissolve the shortening.  It makes a big difference by bringing out the chocolate flavor, rather than diluting it.  Frosted with Caroline's Fudge Frosting from this site.  Yum! Thanks!",

I've made a variation of this before, where I substituted 1 cup of boiling water with 1 cup of milk and the 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup applesauce.

I made a glaze with 1 cup of chocolate chips 1 cup of whipping cream and 2 tsp of vanilla. There were raves all around when I served it. Thanks for a fantastic recipe that I'm planning to use very often!",

I didn't have to level the cake at all. I used 2-9\" round cake pans. As per a couple of readers suggestions I did use 2 cups of boiling water with 2 heaping teaspoons of instant decaf coffee. One problem I did have is that despite greasing and flouring the pans the cakes stuck. One came out nearly perfect and the other one stuck so badly that I couldn't salvage it. I halved the recipe (halves perfectly) and made one more cake. It stuck pretty badly too but I was able to salvage it and use it anyway. For slightly thicker cake layers I would use this recipe plus 1/2 of it. It would be great alone or dusted with cocoa or confectioner's sugar. I iced it with a fabulous chocolate fudge frusting. MMMMMMM!!! I will make this recipe again - definitely.",

Used butter flavor crisco had 1 cup of leftover coffee so used that for part of the water and added some espresso powder to boil with the water. I didn't even use my beaters just a wire wisk. I think the espresso powder added to the flavor of the chocolate and although I just used Hershey's powder it tasted like it was a more expensive chocolate. Made this into a bundt cake and baked @55 minutes in my oven. Made a small review 'muffin' and although it did not puff up on top this would be a good cake to make into a layer because it does bake even. Not over the top sweet and drizzled the bundt cake with some leftover cream cheese frosting when it was slightly warm. Used butter cooking spray for the pan and had no trouble with it sticking. It was gone in 8 hours but I found it did crumble a bit although it was moist. I would maybe throw in a tablespoon or two of applesauce. Maybe using oil instead of shortening would help the crumble problem.",
