I flattened them with my hand and then used a round cookie cutter to shape each cookie.  During the last 5 minutes of baking I carefully placed the chocolate chips on the cookies to ensure that they were melted so they would spread evenly.  Doing it this way takes a little more time but I think the end result is worth it (as you can tell by the photo).  I am going to try these in heart shapes and maybe use mint or orange extract instead of vanilla for Valentines day for my son's 2nd grade class.",
