I cooked mine longer than 40 mins (over an hr I would say) the pumpkin/cream cheese layer was still not set so it was maybe a little firmer on the bottom (more like cookie instead of cake and I thought that was fine tasted good!). Also I may have added a little too much pumpkin that could've been why it took longer. I cooked it until toothpick came out clean in the center. It was delicious!",
