                "reviewBody": "Simple delicious and refreshing. My only concern is labeling this recipe a dessert. Many Mideast cultures eat fruit for dessert (I assume that region is the inspiration for this dish) and I certainly enjoy it as one but for those with a major sweet tooth they might find the recipe unsatisfying as is. If I were presenting this to guests I would either a)serve it as an appetizer instead (it's light and really cleans the palate) or b) serve it as a dessert with a twist. I love it atop rich dark chocolate ice cream but it can also be good on gourmet ice cream flavors like cardamon or rose. Next time though I plan to utilize it as a pomegranate shortcake - i.e. spoon some of the pomegranate into a glass add a small slice of pound cake top with whip cream and a drizzle of honey. Can't wait! Oh two tips: 1) Remove pomegranate seeds over the sink. It's a messy procedure and the juice easily stains. 2) I've only been able to find rosewater in Persian/Arab stores (it comes in a bottle.) You really need it for this dish so make the effort to find and buy it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
