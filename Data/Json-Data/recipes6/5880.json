I have only additional comment and that relates to the number of servings. I scaled this recipe down to two servings and there really wasn t enough chowder for two entree-size dinner servings (and we don t eat huge portions)...just my opinion. As written I will consider this recipe as a first course/appetizer-size portion or if I want to make a meal out of it with soup or salad I ll simply make more. Lately been trying to pay more attention to my carbs and cholesterol so this was a treat and a really good one! john zelahy thanks for sharing your recipe.",
