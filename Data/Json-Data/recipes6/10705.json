But the special extra here is the butter instead of shortening called for in the other receipies. MMMMMM and better for you! I beat my egg whites until firm but not dry and fold carefully into batter. I probably use a full 1/2 cup of pecans also. Keep this refrigerated after baking or it will just literally melt in your mouth. Soften that butter before mixing too. You can use low fat cream cheese if you are cutting a few calories although you really won't notice them much. This one is a diet killer.",

I always try tons of recipes till I find the perfect one, this is it, follow the recipe add a little less powdered sugar if you want. Another member said hers was a flop, you need to grease and flour your pan, never rely on only spray, let em cool quite a bit before you dump them out, and you have to wait until the cake is completley cooled to frost it, the icing is butter and cream cheese (and to die for) it will melt right off if the cake is not cool. I doubled the icing recipe, pile that stuff on there, ice all of it, that's the best part! Throw in lots of pecans (In love with nuts)unbelievable!!!",

Luckily I only needed one piece from the second cake! Also I doubled the frosting as others did so the sides would be frosted too.",
