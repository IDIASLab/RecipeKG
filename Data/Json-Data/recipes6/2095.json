Coat your ribs a couple of hours ahead of time wrap in tinfoil wait... start an indirect charcoal grill place foil wrapped ribs off to the side of the heat and cook for 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Remove ribs from foil and slather with your favorite BBQ sauce ( hopefully altered by you or made from scratch!) I like to lightly char the sauce 3-4 times recoating after each char re coat one last time and bring them in to serve! Best. Ribs. Ever.",
