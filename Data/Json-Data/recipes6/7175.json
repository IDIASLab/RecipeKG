Made this as written except that I used onion buns because they are our favorite. The recipe didn't specify to chop the mushrooms but I did so that they would be more fully incorporated. These are 5 star all the way! Thanks ChristineM!",

I had a pound of bison, but my grocery didn't have any more.  So I used a pound of Kobe ground beef and a pound of chopped portobellos (food processor chopping blade).  Added a clove of minced garlic, cayenne, thyme, a little Worcestershire.  Formed into 7 oz patties and let sit for  little while to come to room temp and drain off some of the moisture from the mushrooms.  Used carmelized onions on top of the cooked burgers.  Really, my family said best burgers they ever had.  Will definitely use this mushroom trick in the future.  Yum",
