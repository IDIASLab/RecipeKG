However my purpose in finding it was try making it more healthy. I substituted 1 cup of oats for the flour 2/3 cup of splenda for the sugar added NO brown sugar used fruit cocktail in its own juice 1 egg white in place of whole egg. It turned out great. With all the calories and fat saved fiber increased I splurged by putting on 4 tblsp. real lite whipping cream from a can. That only added 30 calories. My kids and husband loved it. Now I make it every other week...GUILT FREE.",

I decided to double the recipe and use a 13\"x9\" pan. Like other reviewers mentioned it was more like a cobbler. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor and the sweetness was overpowering to the point of leaving something of an aftertaste. Also like other reviewers stated I don't think it would matter what kind of canned fruit you used because you really don't taste the individual flavors of the fruit. I used one can of light fruit cocktail and one can of mandarin oranges and it didn't seem to make much difference. The fruit did make the cake nice and moist though and the texture was fine even after refrigeration; the top stayed crunchy and the cake didn't go soggy. I definitely agree you could cut the amount of sugar in half. Maybe using half white sugar and half brown sugar in the batter would help improve the flavor and possibly adding a teaspoon or two of a spice such as cinnamon.",
