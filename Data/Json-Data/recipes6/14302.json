This makes enough for two moderately filled pies or one very-very-filled pie with leftovers (yum). My two simplifications: - Instead of a food processor I used a blender - I just added ingredients (with the hot cream) and blended; I didn't find it necessary to drizzle hot liquid in while it was running. - With whipped cream I didn't find it necessary to add sugar slowly. I just added all sugar at the beginning and whipped. Thanks so much! Will be making again!!",
