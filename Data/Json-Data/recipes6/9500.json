In the slow cooker you'll get the moistest, most fool-proof, and hands-off whole chicken that you'll ever make. This recipe uses generous amounts of rosemary and garlic that not only infuse into the chicken, but also season the potatoes that cook underneath the chicken for a savory one-pot meal.",

Good handful of sage, thyme and Greek oregano with plenty of garlic under the skin and in the cavity. Cooked faster than I expected, so I overshot the temperature to about 190 after about five hours, but luckily the chicken was still great, plenty of broth (I was worried there was no added moisture) and the red potatoes and baby carrots were great.  Wife wasn't quite ready to eat, so I sprayed a little oil on the skin, dusted it with pepper and salt and browned it off with the broiler lid for ten minutes or so.",
