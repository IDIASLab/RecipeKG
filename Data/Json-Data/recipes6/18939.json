                "reviewBody": "It tastes fine but then again this is simply a pecan pie made with macadamia nuts so if you like traditional pecan pies made with corn syrup (I prefer pecan pies with caramel filling rather than corn syrup but that's just me) you like macadamia nuts and you like eating pies then you'll definitely be happy with this recipe. The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is primarily because of its appearance. It's unquestionably the ugliest looking pie I've ever made. The flotilla of whole beige macadamias suspended in a crisp filling of dark corn syrup is visually unappealing. The macadamias really stand out with their light color and make the pie look unfinished or undercooked even though it's not. The dark skin of pecans lends a great deal more appeal than light-colored nuts at least with this recipe. There's a reason I was only able to find 2 or 3 recipes for macadamia pies and like 200-300 recipes for pecan pies. It's because macadamias don't look good and don't really taste all that great in pies. They're meant to be covered in chocolate or eaten plain right out of the jar. They're not the type of nut you put in a pie because of the aesthetic reasons I mentioned and because the sweet filling just doesn't compliment the subtle understated taste of the macadamia nut it overwhelms it. Don't take my word for it though. If you are set on baking a macadamia pie for whatever reason try it! It's a very easy recipe with a short prep time so you've got nothing to lose.",
