I beat the egg whites till they were stiff and added the sugar/cinnamon/cocoa mixture to the whites at about 1T at a time (I left out the almonds). Doing this will keep the whites fluffy but as written in the instructions if you add them all at once you'll deflate your eggs. I made 24 of these and put them on parchment paper and they turned out wonderful. They're melt in your mouth crispy on the outside and just a bit chewy on the inside. Bake for 35 minutes and they're perfect.",

After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant on how to proceed but it simply came down to a matter of sticking as closely as possible with the recipe as written to get a good handle on what if any problems there may be with it and out of fairness to the submitter and the recipe. Having said all that I left out the nuts and I used parchment paper to line my cookie sheet instead of greasing it. I agree that this recipe could have been written with more specific detail. That is so important in a recipe so as not to leave the cook second guessing. I whipped the egg whites as directed until stiff but not glossy. I added the rest of the ingredients and stirred as directed. The egg whites did deflate substantially (recipe yielded 20 cookies for me). I dropped the batter by teaspoonful (again being specific is important as 'spoonful' is pretty vague). The batter did not spread out and flatten as it did for another reviewer. I baked at the time/temp indicated on a standard metal baking sheet and the cookies were crisp on the outside and chewy on the bottom. The insides were largely hollow and they are reminiscent of a meringue. They do taste strongly of cinnamon which I loved. I have to add that these 'cookies' are addictive!",
