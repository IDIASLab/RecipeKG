The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4 c more peanut butter (and I use creamy style) and also 1/2-3/4 c coconut just for extra flavor. Meanwhile A TIP for those that complained about the texture...it's all about the boiling time. If you underboil you will get cookies that won't set, if you overboil, you will get cookies that will crumble and not form at all. This recipe calls for 1 1/2 minutes. My suggestion for the perfect cookie is to time it from a FULL boil and do 1 1/2 minutes from that point. If you count from a simmer (just barely bubbling) then make it 2 - 2 1/2 mins tops! You will have to play with it to see how your stove heat, etc. Hope that helps!! Good cookies tho!! 5 stars!",

I made these cookies and immediatedly thought something was wrong.  Too runny and shiny.  The taste was off too. \r\nSo I thought real hard and realized I only used 1/4(1/2 stick butter) and the amount of peanut butter(the taste was missing) was wrong. I reinvented this recipe and I think I have my old one back. I reduced the cocoa to 3 Tbsp., the sugar to 2 C.(because I remember that much about old recipe) and the peanut butter to 1 Cup (Natural is best).  And I think I got my old recipe back.

Also I added the vanilla into the wet stuff way before adding the PB and oats. Also--I didn't time it. Apparently people have a very difficult time with this step--I have no idea why! I brought it to a rolling boil stirred it a little and then took it off the heat after I thought a couple minutes passed. I am sure I cooked it longer than the 90 seconds posted. Lastly I stirred in the PB after turning the heat off and stirred the PB to let it completely melt before adding the oats. After dropping on wax paper I waited an hour and they were PERFECT!!
