As another reviewer suggested I heated the dried chopped cranberries in the OJ zest and brandy and let them sit for about 30 minutes while I rolled out the pastry and cut to fit in the bottoms of a muffin sheet. The cranberries absorbed the liquid by the time I added the rest of the ingredients. As well I used frozen cranberries on the top not fresh as I had them in the freezer.... Not a really strong flavour when you first bite into one but by the time you are finished you just want another!",
