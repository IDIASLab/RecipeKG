Not only is this unique and delicious, it's also super easy--pronouncing it might be the hardest part. Mbeju are best served freshly made. These are generally served with melted butter and a cup of coffee, but I topped mine with some chipotle mayo, sliced avocado, fire-roasted red pepper rings, sliced green onion, and a sprinkle of coarse salt.",
