I used an assortment of apples:\n2 Fujis\n2 Granny Smith\n2 Golden Delecious\nI think that's one of the secrests to a really good apple pie,  combining really good apples together.\nI also ended up adding more cinnamon than called for, about 1 tsp as well as 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as I really like a spicy apple pie. I slpashed about 1 tblp of real mexican vanilla over the top of the apples, before I put the top crust on. \nTo top it off, I brushed 2-3 tblsp mented butter on the top crust, and sprinkled it with a few tblsp granulated sugar. This made for a beautifuly golden, and crispy top crust. I served it warm with fresh whipped cream. YUM!!!!!",

I also drizzled approximately 1 tbsp of real lemon juice over the apple/flour mixture once I put it into the pie shell. This pie had the perfect combination of tart/sweet taste. Warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - absolutely heavenly!!! I use frozen pie crust for the bottom of the pie and my own recipe for the top!! I use the recipe off of the can of Crisco. It has always been a foolproof recipe for me. The two tricks to flaky crust (as taught to me by my mom) try to handle the dough as little as possible. Also use ice water. This time around I also tried chilling the shortening - was one of the best crusts I've ever made! Happy Baking!!",
