For those who said it's not soft enough, there are 3 things I know of that can cause that: baking them too long, using butter instead of shortening, storing them improperly.  Don't expect these to brown before you take them out of the oven - if they're brown, you overcooked them. And as odd as it may sound, butter-flavored Crisco actually works better than real butter in many cookie and pastry recipes.  To store these, place them in an airtight container or ziploc bag with a slice of soft white bread; the bread will turn hard, but the cookies will stay soft.  Just make sure you remove the hard bread and add a fresh slice each day (good luck - these cookies only last HOURS in my house!).  Thanks again, Linda!",

This will cause taste variations and cooking consequences to turn out bad. I will give some advice...do not bake them for 9 minutes. Try them for 6 or 7 minutes. This will leave them soft and chewy. If your cookie dough is coming out like clay then try some variations like cutting down some of the flour. If it is pastey, add a tsp of milk. I myself had no problems with this recipe and found it to be very very good. Thank you so much for such a wonderful cookie.. It was excellent and we ate them up.",
