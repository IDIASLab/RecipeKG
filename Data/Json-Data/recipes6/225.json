Here is the perfect recipe!  I had all the ingredients in and it looked easy and yummy and WOW was my assumption correct.  In the past few years I\u2019ve gotten lazy with holiday cooking, but this year with a pandemic on I\u2019ve had to get back to it and I had forgotten that all the sweat and stress was often worth it for the excuse to try out amazing recipes.  I made this cranberry sauce exactly as the recipe instructed and I will never make a different cranberry sauce again.  It\u2019s warm and rich and just the right balance of tart and sweet without the spices overwhelming the palate.  A+++++, we\u2019ll be seeing this one again at Christmas for sure",
