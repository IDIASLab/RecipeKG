A casserole dish works as well. I omitted the extract hemp and chia and substituted raisins for dates (dried cranberries would work as well). I did 1/4 teaspoon cardamom to zip it up but it still was a little bland. I would add more next time pumpkin pie spice or mace might work as well. Lastly if you bake it remember to spray the surface with pam or something similar. A lot of the granola stuck and I had to tear it off.",
