At the request of my husband I added a little grated Parmesan/Romano to 2 of the breasts but all the others were made according to recipe. I wouldn't change a thing! 5.9.2018 - I have made this a few times in the last two years but had small sage leaves this time and added two small leaves p/chicken breast. Wish I could remember the pre-packaged prosciutto brand I used to get but tried a different one from the deli as I couldn't find the package. This makes a difference to me in the dish as I could barely notice prosciutto was in the chicken this time. I did add some grated parmesan cheese on top before rolling up the chicken breasts. Also lightly seasoned outside of chicken breasts with salt and pepper first. Still a good recipe but get a decent prosciutto.",
