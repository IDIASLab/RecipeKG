The flavor was fine but this does not bake up like a regular cake - it's more of a shortcake. Very thick and not very sweet. Perhaps I did not have enough of the filling to soak into the layers. That's where the real flavor comes from. You have to press the dough very evenly into the pan as it does not rise or change shape at all. If the middle if low your entire cake will look like a sunken ship. Again if this is what I had expected I might have made more of the filling or used a very juicy strawberry topping. I might just do that!",

The baked product was dry and lumpy. It did not soak up the applesauce very well and was unequally saturated with sauce. It smelled bland. This seems more like dough to be used as a crumble strawberry shortcake. It was nothing like the Southern stack cakes I've ever eaten. It was intended to be a birthday cake and I considered it un-servable. I ended up baking a different cake to serve and jamming this one in the freezer for later.",
