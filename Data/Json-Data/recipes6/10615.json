After the dough rose the last time, I rolled it around either some sausage and cheese or ham and swiss. allowed the dough to rise once more, and then baked till golden. Everyone loved them. I now have to keep quite when I am getting ready to make them, else the nieghbours all bring ingredients so I can make them some as well; and then I am making these things all day long. I will put all this together soon and post it so that anyone who wants to try it can.",
