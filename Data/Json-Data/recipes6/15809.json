Of course cranberries are a little tart/bitter but if it had been on turkey instead of my fork and hot it would be great!! I'm excited to try it. 2 tips: Grate the orange peel...I did about 1tbsp and that's really all I thought it needed. 2. For the orange liquer I used half of the orange I grated and a drop of vodka. Great recipe super easy to make. Thanks!",
