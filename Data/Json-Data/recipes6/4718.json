Little bit of Irish, little bit of the Mediterranean, and a little bit of home makes for a great eat. This recipe is delicious vegan or non-vegan. It's a great base for additions too.

I'll add the tomatoes after toasting the rice. It never toasted properly because the tomato left too much liquid. Also I'll add some chickpeas when instructed but reserve a few for the end of cooking. They become soft giving the risotto a creamy texture like when adding cheese but I wanted a few solid ones too. We like things spicy so the amount of spices was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.",
