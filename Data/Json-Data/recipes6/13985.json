I used 8 granny smith apples sliced thin, tossed in the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, a few splahes of lemon juice, left out the almonds and almond extract and opted for a couple tsp. of vanilla instead. I also left out the butter and tossed in 1/4 cup of cornstarch vs. flour to thicken up the juices. I used \"Baker's Secret Pie Crust\" from this site which is phenomenal! I baked this the night before (1 hour and 15 min.) to let the pie set before cutting into it - I must admit temptation almost got the better of me but I didn't want to ruin it.  When we did finally cut it open boy was it incredible - the apple slices were piled nice and high, it thicken up beautifully and it went perfect with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream - hey you have to indulge once in a while!",

Then I cooked the pie in the other frozen shell and pie pan. The crust is unbelievable! Now lets talk about this recipe. I was interested in this particular recipe becasue it specifically called for macintosh apples and thats what I had on hand. Ive never made a pie with macs before. I usually use granny smith. Anywho Let me give you some advice. Cook this pie the day before your going to slice into it. I cooked it and sliced into it about 4 hours after I took it out of the oven and I was left with a soupy mess on my hands. I blamed the macintosh apples thinking there was too much moisture in the apples. I was very upset. BUT......THE NEXT DAY!.......I went to go look at my soupy mess and it was completey \"SET\".....Now Im not a big apple pie maker but I thought beginners should know to let the pie completely cool and set before digging into it. Thats why Im giving it 5 stars. It was delish! Sweeter than the granny smith I usually use. Great with icecream! I also didnt use the extract...I dont think I'd like it in an apple pie.",

Use firm/tart apples such as granny smiths and you won't have a runny pie.Slice it somewhat thin so it will cook thoroughly. Sometimes I will add one semi-firm such as red delicious ida red or any other semi-firm apple. Using granny smiths you will find that is the reason for this amount of sugar in the recipe.

After letting the pie stand for about 3 hours I sliced it and had nothing but a soupy soupy soupy mess with not enough flavor for my taste. I managed to salvage the pie by carefully lifting the top crust and adding about 1/3 cup of flour to the mixture and then returning it to the oven to bake for another 25 minutes. I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg. This enhanced the overall taste and added more much needed flavor. After letting this cool the second time it turned out great. I will make this recipe again but next time I will definately add atleast 1/4 cup more flour and probably double the seasoning just out of personal preference.",
