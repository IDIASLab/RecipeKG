'Nothing personal DelMonte!;D With that brownie- stiff batter so added 1/3c half & half. I don't like washing dishes very much - or even running the dishwasher often To only use the third cup cup I reduced the sugar to 2/3 & used that same 1/3c cup for the oil. May go for 1/4c coconut oil next time but that would take another cup. These didn't rise much & could use a boost. Pretty but low & flat Muffs didn't rise above the wrapper at all & I baked at 400 for ten initially then 350 for ten. E 23 had one & announced he was going to eat all of them.",
