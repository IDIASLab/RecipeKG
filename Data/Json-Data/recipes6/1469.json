In looking over the recipe I thought it could use a little more sugar (can't believe I said that!), and specifically white sugar.  So in addition to the 1 cup brown sugar, I added 1/2 cup of granulated sugar as well.  Good call - perfectly sweet.  As for the cinnamon chips, I used the whole darn bag, essentially doubling what the recipe directed.  I was pleased with that too. Great cookie!",
