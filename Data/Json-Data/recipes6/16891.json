In NY wieners with meat sauce are Coneys and are not the same. I have quested for years to duplicate these smallish (but not mini) dogs that we would eat by the dozen. This meat sauce is great and tastes like the real deal. It is not supposed to be too spicey. It is simple and easy to make unlike other recipes I ve tried. I used a potato masher to make the chunks of browned ground beef finer for the sauce. Authentic method of preparation is visual and dramatic. Numerous dogs in buns are placed side by side up the chef s arm to apply the condiments in assembly line fashion. It is nearly a friendly chef s competition to see how many dogs can be prepared in one armload. For real authentic flavor use only plain yellow mustard and fresh chopped onions. I had forgotten about the celery salt but it is critical for the genuine experience. Use the cheapest smallest 12oz. packages of dogs you can find and cut off the rounded ends. Broiling them seems to be an acceptable substitute for the rotating hot dog grills the restaurants use. I don t do this but there seems to be some additional authenticity and benefit as well to wrapping them in deli paper and allowing the meat sauce to soak into and steam the buns slightly before chowing down.",

How much chili can you put on a hotdog fercryin'outloud?). A sweeter type of sauce (I added 1/4 t. of cayenne - gave it a slight \"hot\" finish) and now I don't have to jump in the car to go to Texas Weiner II on Rt. 22 (Still the reigning champ of Texas weiners).

I used the whole can and 1 tsp of the spices no beef bouilan as it has to much sodium. I used 1/2 cup of onions in the mix as not to over power it for my son. I topped mine with the mustard onions and celery seeds as described in the desciption... Very Good! Thank you something different than my chili sauce I make...",

I also ended up doubling (in addition to the double reicpe) the spices because before it didn't really have any kind of taste other than being salty. Last night when I made it I really didn't care for it but we were having it for dinner tonight. I was suprised when I got home from work and sat down to one that the flavor had really developed into something much more than last night.
