Also how big of balls did you make? \r\n\r\nI made balls the size of large marbles and I got around 6 dozen...also my dough was not messy at all...I had to press it to make it stick together into balls (once pressed they stayed formed very well...not crumbly at all)\r\n\r\nAnyway...I just made these and they are very good and very christmasy :) I must say though, that when I took the \"dough\" out of the oven I was suprised at the consistancy. It was a  dry \"casserole\" (looked like dressing) that I wasn't expecting. Better words could be used in the directions to save confusion. (the directions say to beat well with a wooden spoon...it should say to break up or loosen)  I almost discarded it but I took my wooden spoon and \"beat\" it as best I could. (I just stired and got it all loosened and broken up) As long as you aren't thinking of typical cookie dough you'll be ok. \r\nAfter the mixture cooled I pressed the dough into balls and rolled them in sugar assembly line style. It was very easy but a bit time consuming...they are good though...and very Grandma-ish  :) thanks for sharing Peggy!",

And thank you to the reviewer who formed the mixture into logs using plastic or paper and then cut off pieces to form into balls and roll in the sugar.  That made it go super fast and really contained the stickiness.  The first person to try them asked for the recipe.",

My recipe says to take the casserole out of the oven every 10 minutes and scrape the sides with a fork to keep the coconut from getting burned on the edges. (The problem is that it tastes so good that I have to eat a forkful each time I stir. Yummy!!) I usually let it cool overnight and roll them into small balls the next day. You can freeze them after you roll them into balls. I then roll them in powdered sugar not granulated. They are best just big enough to pop in your mouth not bite. (powdered sugar can be a little messy to eat.) Everyone loves these. My daughter-in-law made them with dried cherries when she didn't have dates. Yes these are messy to make....but worth it.",

Dough was crusty on the outside and gooey on the inside when it came out of the oven but it all stirred together to form a sort of crumbly mixture. It is certainly easier to roll into balls if you wait until the dough is completely cool.

It made them a tad bit sweet so I added some coco powder and it reduced the sweetness a bit. I put the batter in a 9\" brownie pan and that was fine. Yes they do get a bit sticky but I just put some sugar in my palm and rolled away. It makes a large quantity and they are delicious!",

They turned out really well and we ended up fighting over who got the last cookie. I used sweetened angel flake coconut candied cherries candied ginger walnuts and after the mixture had cooled down I also added chocolate chips. They were sticky to roll so I ended up using parchment paper to roll the mixture into a log and then sliced off equal portions which didn't require quite as much handling. Next time I will skip rolling them in sugar as they are pretty sweet already. I will definitely make them again as the whole family loved them.",
