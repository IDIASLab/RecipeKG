I dug out a canteloupe and a grapefruit and placed the dip inside on the fruit tray and on the table.  The party guests were going mad trying to figure out how I made it. Hint: I mix it the same as I do when making pound cakes from scratch.  Let the cream cheese and cool whip get room temperature or soft. Blend those 2 first, then slowly add in white sugar, then slowly blend in brown sugar stopping to mash out any lumps with your fingers or a fork. Then add in your honey. This is a typical way to blend any type of ingredients with cream or butter. Try slicing open a pineapple or any large fruit and filling it with the dip.  Presentation is everything!! Enjoy it!!!",
