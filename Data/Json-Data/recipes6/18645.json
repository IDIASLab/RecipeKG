I used half brown sugar and half white\n3. I also added 1 tsp crushed ginger which is a key ingredient for this dish, I'm surprised it's not listed.\n4. Instead of using mirin which is Japanese, I used Korean cooking wine, attention: rice wine vinegar is NOT a substitute!!!! You can however use mirin if that is the only thing you can find.\n5. to soften the meat, add shredded Korean pear to the marinade, if you can't find it, someone suggested Kiwi pulp which is good too.\n6. The sesame oil should be added after the meat has been marinated for a while as it prevents the flavour get into the meat. \nAnd if you don't like chuck eye, try topside sirloin, works just as well!\nThe meat is tradtionally served with steamed rice.\nHope this info is useful.",

But here's a few cosmetic suggestions to make it even more authentic: First, add three chopped green onions. Second, add one onion, thinly sliced lengthwise. However, I wouldn't dream of suggesting anything about the actual marinade, since it is absolutely perfect. This dish is the pride and joy of Koreans (and their national dish), and I'm sure you'll understand why when you try it!\r\n* A friend of mine who also makes this dish always has the most soft, tender beef. After years of badgering, I finally got her to tell me her secret. She adds a tiny amount of fresh, crushed kiwi, less than 1/8 tsp to 2 lbs of beef. I was skeptical, but gave it a shot. I can tell you that it really does work! It was melt in your mouth delicious. Don't be tempted to use more, or you'll end up with a powdery beef mush.",

Or for a much leaner disch very thinly sliced (from the butcher) roast beef. The marinate should be made of the ingrediates listed but also a puree of carrots green peppers and mushrooms and lots of garlic at least 5 cloves... use this with the other ingredients. Also not sure if I saw but you should use seamee seed oil. And toasted seamee seeds for the marrinating and final top off.",

I recommend freezing the meat prior to slicing so you can get the pieces as thin as possible. THIN IS KEY for this recipe. Also you don't need to marinate 12-24 hours...2 hours is plenty.

For those who find the saltiness of the soy sauce a bit too much darker (Chinese) rather then the lighter (Japanese) soy sauce packs tons of flavor without the intense saltiness of the Japanese varieties.
