But holiday time always mean Sweet potato Casserole..this one is the closest to how my granny and mom made it.  I used 3 BAKED sweet potatoes (I often double the recipe).  For a single recipe I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and I double the vanilla up to 1 tsp.  I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I add 1 tsp of cinnmon, 1/4 tsp of both ground clove and ground nutmeg.  For the topping..I double the recipe even on the single recipe.  Does that make sense?? LOL  ENJOY!!!!\n",

A TIP:  it's much more flavorful if you use baked sweet potatoes - baked for at least 1.5 to 2 hours to bring out their full flavor - than if you boil them.  It's also a lot easier - just cut the cooked potatoes in half and scoop out their goodness - no peeling!  And do not substitute other nuts for pecans.  It's just not the same without the true southern nut meant for sweet potatoes!",

I cut them and placed into my food processor with the other ingredients (and I doubled the vanilla to 1 tsp).  This came out so so so smooth - it's a wonderful texture.\n\nI doubled the topping and it was plenty (maybe could use a bit more even) as soon as I took it from the oven I had to try it and it's delicious!  I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.\n**If you boil your potatoes, you leave the skin on and peel when they're done. \n*UPDATE* I made this again with canned sweet potatoes and while it was good it isn't AS good as fresh baked potatoes.  I suggest if you want to impress your guests stick to the baked potatoes, it's more work BUT so worth it. Plus with canned potatoes it was runny and not whipped - we didn't care for that.",

The recipe claims it serves 12, but we finished it off with only 8 people, so I'd recommend making extra if you are serving a hungry crowd.  \n\nI found that baking the sweet potatoes helped them retain a better flavor than boiling them.  I put 5 large sweet potatoes on a cookie sheet in a 375F oven for about 1 1/4 hours.  Then I sliced them in half and used a potholder to squeeze the potatoes.  The insides popped right out of the skin; I didn't even need a spoon.\n\nOh, and if you think the recipe would  be improved by doubling the amount of pecan/butter/sugar topping, I'd recommend against it.  It will taste delicious, but you'll end up with unappetizing pools of butter on the top.",

Start with baking 6 sweet potatos (ensure that they are the same size so the consistentcy is the same as they cook), instead of boiling.

Double ALL of the ingredients for the pecan topping and give the pecans a rough chop so there aren't any big pieces.  Add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping mixture.~~~ If you try it this way, you will never make another sweet potato casserole dish.  This makes the BEST sweet potato casserole ever!

The bananas roast in their own skin and oils and become like banana pudding.  Add that to the puree, with a touch of maple syrup for sweetness.  Guaranteed to please!",

Something about the entire casserole was far too sweet. I normally love sweet potatoes but I don't know if I did something wrong or if it's just the recipe. I did as someone said and baked the sweet potatoes I may have baked them a little too long though.. Thanks for the experience but this recipe just didn't cut it for me..",
