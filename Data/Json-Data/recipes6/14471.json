I used green pepper yellow pepper onion mushrooms sliced diagonal sliced carrots and celery. I left out the sugar since I don't like sweet sauces. I doubled the amount of ginger and garlic (well maybe I tripled it). I added a dash of dry sherry since I am allergic to oysters....and it turned out fantastic. Next time want to try broccoli instead of peppers. Maybe add bamboo shoots and water chestnuts too. Thank you for this recipe.",

I ALWAYS double the sauce paste because it thickens better. I would definitely use oyster sauce if you can find it because it adds another good dash of flavor to the sauce. I only use broccoli with this recipe because I don't really like fancy colorful veggies. It's also a good basic recipe and leaves lots of room for adding your own things. Doesn't take very long either so give it a try.",

                "reviewBody": "We enjoyed this but I improvised with the recipe particularly in the technique. I used a sirloin steak that I sliced very thinly against the grain and on the diagonal when it was still in a semi-frozen state. Because it was so thinly sliced it needed a very brief cooking time just a minute or two on high heat. I removed it from the pan then cooked the rest of the vegetables little by little and being careful not to crowd the pan on high heat and again just a minute or so until they were crisp-tender. As I cooked each ingredient I dumped it in a holding bowl. When the meat and all the vegetables were cooked I returned it all back to the pan where I added the sauce ingredients omitting the sugar and ginger and enough broth to get it to the desired thickness. I like very little if any sauce with my stir fry so the amount of it was just right for me in fact I didn t even use all of the broth called for. Stir fry requires no simmering so I returned it to the heat just long enough for the cornstarch mixture to thicken. Served over hot cooked rice this was so tasty and just to our liking - without the sugar and ginger and with nothing overcooked in order to retain each ingredient s flavor and color. I ll be hitting the road again so this was an ideal and delicious way to make use of the baby bok choy sweet onion zucchini mixed color bell peppers and mushrooms I had in the fridge.",
