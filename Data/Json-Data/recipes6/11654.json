Mom passed away a few months ago and her infamous fruitcake was mentioned more than once at her funeral. We never thought we would be without our mom or her wonderful fruitcake. I'd never made fruitcake before but decided to try baking some for my sister and brother for Christmas. When I inquired after Mom's recipe no one could find it. After reading through 20 fruitcake recipes I came upon \"Mom's Fruitcake Recipe\". What sold me was \"no citrus fruits but lots of cherries gum drops (my favorite) raisins nuts and spices. I immediately made a double batch. It tasted just like my mom's. Wonderful! That was three weeks ago and it's all gone. Today is 12/9/12 and I'm making a triple batch tonight. Everyone who has tasted it loved it. Even those who didn't like fruitcake like this one. My sister brother and I thank you so much Sharon for keeping our Mother's memory alive by sharing this recipe with us all. I did make a couple of changes. I did hear my mom say once that she put applesauce in her fruitcake so I substituted applesauce for apple jelly and orange juice for brandy.",
