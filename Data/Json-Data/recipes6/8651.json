I grew up in the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and have eaten a lot of curry in my life, in every form you can imagine! This particular dish consists of a yellow curry sauce (a little bit spicy), with chicken and potatoes which is served over jasmine rice. You can also use it as filling inside of a roti skin (minus the rice).",
