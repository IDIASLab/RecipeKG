It didn't puff up perhaps because while I did take it out of the refrigerator in advance it may have not come up to room temp or the oven was not true to temp. I thought the flavor was good not amazing but my guests (all rutabaga lovers) were not excited about it either. The carrot seems to take away from the rutabaga tang with it's sweetness. I think if I were to try this again I might leave out the carrot.....and bring it up to temp before baking it in an oven I trust. thanks",
