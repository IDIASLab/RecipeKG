First I'm always looking for ways to \"sneak\" veggies into my cooking (my boyfriend is not big on them LoL ) So I sauted a couple chopped carrots with some red onion in a little EVOO before adding my tomatoe paste and sauce. I used Italian seasining just for convience instead of all the individual spices it called for. I also added a couple dashs of Franks Red Hot Sauce and a couple glugs of Black Bean with Ginger and Garlic sauce. I added more minced garlic then called for. I didn't have chicken breasts so I used thighs instead. Before pouring the sauce on the chicken I stirred in half a chopped red pepper and half a chopped yellow pepper. (By adding them last it prevents them from getting soggy) Instead of motzza I used parm cheese. Turned out great! I served it over some lightly buttered linguini. Yummy!!!",

Both times the meal tasted good the chicken was fully cooked and the sauce was good. I really think this loses something by being breaded but not sealed (frying/baking chicken before adding sauce) though. I don t think I ll give it a third try it s just a slightly quicker version of Chicken Parmesan and it really doesn t add much to the traditional. Thanks for sharing this recipe though! Oh and a tip for the sauce using puree instead of the sauce itself gives the sauce a great depth.",

I used a bottle of my favorite sauce and used half a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste. I also added tomatoes and onions. The chicken is so moist and juicy in this dish (and I'm not the biggest fan of chicken breast). My husband really loved this meal and we are having it for leftovers tonight.

Then I added 1.5 can of large tomato sauce and 0.5 can of tomato paste sugar and the dried spices like it calls for. In the meanwhile I coated my Tyson fozen chicken breast( the thin kind) with bread crumb and galic pepper and browned on very high heat on a oven ready pan. I layered the cheese and poured 1/2 of the sauce over them. The chicken was baked for 30 minutes on 420 degree. While the chicken was cooking I pour 2 cans of vegetable broth to the rest of \"sauce\" in the pot and added bay leaves 1 bag of fozen vegetable mix and 3 cups of celery. I let the soup simmered for 15 minutes and it was done. The chicken was close to done at that time. So I added the rest of cheese on top of it. Both the soup and the chicken just turned out great.",
