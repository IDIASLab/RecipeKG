This so far is my favorite.  Now just understand I work out a lot and try to eat as nutritionally healthy as I can. This is my tweaked recipe; I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, I use lt. brown sugar instead of white sugar, I use 3 tbl. butter instead of a 1/2 cup and replace the rest with applesauce.  I add maybe a little more applesauce because I like the moistness it offers, and lastly I don't use currants I use frozen blueberries cuz I love em!They make the scones a litte funny in color but I don't mind.  I have used rice flour ick, soy flour and white together, was ok, but these wheat ones are the best!  I also shoot a shot of honey in just because I like it.  I have used craisins, dried nectarines, all sorts of dried fruit but I still like the frozen blueberries the best. I am sure these scones are great as is, I just try to change recipes around for my liking sometimes.  This one was fun and I thank Carol for first submitting it!  Jodie",

I added one julienned Granny Smith apple (skin-on), 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. Before putting them in the oven I also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and coarse sugar. YUMMMMMM!!! I had to try one when they first came out because they smelled so good, and then I couldn't resist eating another one right away! I took the rest into work *the next day* (how many scones are still great the next day??) and everybody loved them as much as I did. A++++ recipe, thanks!",
