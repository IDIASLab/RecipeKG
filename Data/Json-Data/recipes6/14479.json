I used homemade apple butter which was very fresh and vibrant so that wasnt the issue. I tasted the dough before I baked it and I added a lot mere spices to it.. I used more cinnamon added more salt nutmeg allspice and some ginger. The cookies came out with a nice taste but the apple was pretty faint. I made a glaze with some powdered sugar and apple butter.. that bumped the flavor up",

Other than that I thought was following the recipe very closely but when it came to forming the disks it was very very soft. I had to wet my fingers because the dough was so sticky wet. It took much longer to cook. I appreciate that all ovens are different but when I took this out of the oven initially it was too soft in the centre so I put it back for about another half hour. I I don't know that it tastes like apple pie but in spite of upping the spices it is a nice kind of spicy shortbread I would make again and really increase the spices and/or add more apple butter and increase the flour.",
