I've never cooked with rhubarb before and didn't buy enough so I ended up with 2 cups rather than 3, but since I used a frozen pie crust it seemed to be a perfect amount. I left all of the rest of the ingredient amounts the same. It turned out great.. the sugar mixed with the rhubarb creates a nice layer on the crust for an extra sweet touch. I've since made this using frozen blackberries and it was equally good. In fact, my bf said to try it with frozen peach slices next time. It's a versatile recipe that I'll use over and over.. thank you!",
