                "reviewBody": "I have an almost identical version of this recipe in an old book and decided to try it when I was craving brownies but didn't have chocolate chips or baking chocolate on hand for melting. Since one reviewer said it lacked a strong chocolate flavor and I also thought there would be wayyyy too much sugar in this recipe (a cup of sugar PLUS all the HFCS in the syrup?!) I made the following adjustments: I used 1 1/2 cups of syrup (as opposed to 2 cups which would be 16oz) and I added 1/2 cocoa powder. The result tasted like brownies from a boxed mix which honestly I am not particularly fond of but it wasn't too bad for a last-minute brownie emergency. I would say avoid the frosting on these if you want to actually taste your brownies. Anything made from melted chocolate like the frosting will have a stronger chocolate taste than the brownie itself and then you end up using the brownie as a tasteless spoon for the chocolate. I much preferred to eat the brownie without the frosting.",

This came out like a fudge cake. I had all ingredients at room temp prior to mixing. This is to die for!  Ok, my changes were: I did not use walnuts and I used a total of 1/2 cup regular milk, 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of marshmallows for the frosting. This was out of this world! I will make according to recipe next time and not double, but still place in a 9 x 13.
