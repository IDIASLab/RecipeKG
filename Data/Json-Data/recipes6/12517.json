Equally at home with a tall cold glass of milk or a steaming mug of latte. I made two minor alterations. The 2 tsp of salt seemed too high to me so I cut back to 1-1/2 tsp and the result seemed just right to my palate. I discovered I only had 1 cup of raisins so I filled in with a cup mixed of craisins and cut-up prunes. I did allow them to cool before mixing them in as directed and I did chill overnight. However the second time I made them I didn't chill and there was no discernible difference in the end product. They don't spread on the sheet so what you see going into the oven is pretty much what you get coming out. Mine therefore were much puffier than those pictured. Lovely chewy texture which equals a good keeper. The spice makes them irresistible. 10 minutes was perfect timing. The recipe makes a lot so perfect for a crowd one you'll be proud to serve. A fabulous heritage cookie jar filler.",

I mixed up the whole batch formed them into four rolls and keep them in the refrigerator for quick treats. One thing I did wrong is to mix the raisins in with the dough in the Kitchen Aid mixer. After boiling the raisins they broke up instead of staying whole. Next time I will mix them in by hand. I think I will add some chopped dates next time too and maybe increase the nutmeg a bit and add some nuts. They would make Hermits that way. But they are GREAT cookies!!!!",

The only change I made is that I really didn't let the raisins and water cool before I added it to the dough and I did not chill until the dough was firm. I don't think it mattered though -- They turned out great especially if you like cookies with a cake-like texture to them. Next time I will error on the side of baking for less time. They looked kind of pale when I check on them at 10 minutes so I baked them for 12 and were a little darker than I would have liked them to be. Will definitely make again and again!",
