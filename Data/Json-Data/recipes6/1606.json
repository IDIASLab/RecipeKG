With the frosting they make a not-as-guilty treat! The texture of the frosting I found to be very strange...way too sticky with the melted butter and peanut butter. I added more cold margerine and powdered sugar (and used rice milk) to make a more traditional-texture frosting, which was delicious. This is definitely a recipe I will be adding to the repertoire!",
