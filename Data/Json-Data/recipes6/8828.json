The only one bad thing I have to say about this recipe is that the potatoes did stick so next time I would use some non-stick spray. Hubby couldn't stop raving about these and asked if he cold have the leftovers for lunch. I did make my own pesto but I think store bought would work just as well. I will make this often with all of the grilling I do.",
