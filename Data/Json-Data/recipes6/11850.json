These cookies tasted divine esp. warm -- like a little bit of heaven I absolutely cannot rave enough about the taste. They are very difficult to make though because you want to make sure each cookie has at least one berry but the cookies should be small because they spread a lot in the oven. Also as another commented they collapse -- when removed from the sheet some of the bottoms literally dropped out so I would suggest cooling on a flat surface or on a rack with a very tight weave.",
