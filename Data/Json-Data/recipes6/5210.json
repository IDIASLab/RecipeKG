I recently bought some Indian sweet potatoes so I used those. Their flesh is not orange but they are sweet and delicious. Next time I think I will cut down the amount of butter again. It doesn't add anything to the dish other than fat and calories and really who wants that??? Overall this is a hit and I think you will enjoy this one!",
