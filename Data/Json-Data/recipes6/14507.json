I chose sharp cheddar shredded over American cheese slices and since it said stir in if desired and I didn't desire I topped the bowl of chili with the cheese instead. The flavor was very good there was a little kick but nothing so hot that you have trouble eating it. I will make this again it was quick and easy and very little prep work or cleanup.",
