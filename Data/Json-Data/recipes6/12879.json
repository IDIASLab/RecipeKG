We had ours with vanilla ice cream and Sue's Homemade Hot Fudge sauce. Yum! We tried varying degrees of done-ness and the slightly gooey center was the universal favorite so keep a close eye on the waffle iron! I can't wait to bust this one out for company. (I think I'm going to try the Cinnamon Ice Cream recipe here with it too. MMMMmmm....)",

The batter is way too heavy even though I added a few more tablespoons of water to it. My waffle iron did not want to lie flat because the batter was so thick and when I pressed the lid down it was still so thick that it did not encompass the whole iron surface. The consistency of the batter before cooking resembles that of a brownie but that's where it ends. These waffles are like eating chocolate bricks. I didn't realize that their were other listed recipes for \"chocolate waffles\". I will try those. They seem to looks lighter having leavening agents/ more ingredients. Sorry they were pretty bad.",

Then near the end.. I got a little crazed and added maraschino cherry juice to the last two rounds worth of batter.. and Voila!! a Chewy Brownie!:) Thanks for posting a fun recipe. We will make this one again.",

I spinkled powdered sugar on top my husband topped his with strawberry jam and my kids ate them al la mode. Either way they were a hit. Not too sweet by themselves but in my opionion that made them better because we could all find our own individual way to eat them. Oh..as an added bonus they were extremely easy to make and even easier to clean up considering you only use one pot and your waffle iron! Definatly a make again!",
