I didn't use the sliced pineapple (forgot it) and nicely decorated the top w/ the cherries. On 1/2 of the kugel I added raisins (1/2 the family likes raisins the other half don't). I used a 16 oz can of crushed pineapple and so glad I did- YUMMY! I also used more noodles than the recipe (about 2-3 oz more). I know it's supposed to be a side dish but I used it as my dessert and it was a smash! ENJOY!",

I thought there was too much liquid in the mixture so I used the whole 12 oz bag of pasta instead of 8oz. I will definately use this recipe again but next time I will add golden raisins to add texture. Also I will use pineapple tidbits instead of slices so that it is easier to cut and every piece of kugel has pineapple.",

I sprinkled it with confectionary sugar to sweeten up the final product but would probably add 1/4 cup or more of sugar if serving it as a dessert. Beware of overcooking this; I checked it after 40 minutes and it was barely beginning to brown on top. After another 10 minutes it was golden but also overcooked meaning the egg was shaggy and the noodles dried out. Next time I will look for the middle to be set instead of golden. I was not going to add the sliced pineapple on top but was glad I did both for appearance and overall taste.
