I found this recipe, and replaced the doughnuts with my cookies and it turned out great!  It tastes just like \"Budin\" which is a dessert made in Peru.

I didn't have any evaporated milk so i used 1 160z can of thi coconut milk and the rest half and half. It came out beautiful. Has a taste of douhgnuts but a bit like bread pudding also. As others have said this is not the usual bread pudding but then this is not hte usual recipe for bread pudding. I would make it again maybe trying different kinds of douhgnuts and rolls.

I always triple this recipe so that I use a dozen doughnuts and bake for about an hour before I start to check on it. I add an additional teaspoon or so of orange extract and some shredded coconut. I place  plastic wrap directly onto (not over) the mixture before i refrigerate it. This helps keep it moist, and such that i can press the mixture down several, random times before baking it.

I used 5 large glazed donuts, chocolate, maple and plain, a 9 oz bottle of starbuck's raspberry mocha with a little extra 2 percent milk in place of the evaporated milk, and lemon instead of orange zest (added after all was combined).  Used heart shaped silicone cupcake pan, got six filled to the top with a cup and a half extra, so I greased up my favorite coffee mug and poured in the extra.  Topped each cup cake with about 1 tbsp semi-sweet choc and baked off for about 50 minutes (heart shaped cupcakes) and 60ish minutes for the mug.  DELECTABLE!
