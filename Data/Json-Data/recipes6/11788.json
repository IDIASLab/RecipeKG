I had everything already except for the chocolate. They were simple to make and tasted delicious! My husband is a big brownie critic and he ate 3!! Needless to say, I will be making again. I did not use 4 eggs but 3. I think my only complaint is that it was a little too cakey but next time I will use only 2 eggs and see if it solves the problem. I also baked them in a 9x9 pan. We like them thick and a 9x13 would just be too thin. I baked an extra 7-8 minutes.\n**update**\nI think I have perfected this recipe. Only use 2 eggs and bake in a 9x9 pan for 30 minutes. I add abot a cup of semi sweet choc chips to the batter as well and it is WONDERFUL!! They turn out thick and fudgy, just the way brownies are supposed to be.",

My husbands' co-workers love the peanutbutter twist we did with this recipe - follow the recipe using two eggs instead of four. Add 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of Reeses Peanutbutter Chips (instead of walnuts) before popping into the oven. Once completely baked let it cool for ten minutes then add 1/2 a mini peanutbutter cup on top of each brownie. Delicious! Edit Make sure you use a large enough pan. When I first tried this recipe it came out goopy (8x8). Then I tried using my larger pan and it came out great. I also noticed that my darker pans produce a softer edge; glass pans tend to crisp up the edges (alter cook times a bit for this). So for those of you having a hard time getting this recipe to fully bake try a larger pan.",
