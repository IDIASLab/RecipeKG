On the down side, when using it as a pie filling with a graham cracker crust, it seeps more liquid than I would like a pie to.  It sets up fine but then liquid seeps from it.  I made it with cocoa powder for a chocolate pudding pie and I topped it with whipped cream.  I made it for my son because he hates Key Lime and I made Key Lime for my husband, and my son did not care for it at all.  He might just be more used to the instant puddings.  It is really important with this pudding to really get all the white away from the yolks, my yolks were not too eager to fully separate, despite my use of an egg separator, so I had little bits of curdled egg white in it, not a lot but it freaked my son out.   I did not have a problem with burning.  I use quality thick bottom pots and have an electric stove and heated it on medium heat and stirring with a wire whisk.",

Stopping at any point will scorch the milk.  \n\nWhen it comes to adding eggs to anything really hot, it's probably best to temper them before adding them. That means to add a little at a time of the hot mixture to the egg mixture, about  1/2 cup in total, mixing between each addition. THEN add it to your main pot/bowl/whatever. I'd rather not risk making scrambled eggs in my pudding. \n\nBefore adding it to a graham cracker  crust, I always cool it before hand. This way, it has a chance to thicken further, and is less likely to make the crust soggy. \n\nThis is what works for me. If any other method works for you, then do that.
