I substituted trubinado sugar for the white sugar. I substituted cashews for the walnuts which we added directly to the dough. The kids liked that the cookies do not spread much while cooking so many can be cooked at one time. (Which also allows for the cooling of many at one time and thus the eating of many. LOL!) We did not roll the cookies in nuts or sugar for the first batch because we forgot. We were glad we did. These have a shortbread consistency without being too sweet. They freeze well too.",
