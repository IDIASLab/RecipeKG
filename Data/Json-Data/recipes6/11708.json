I used a prior feedback recommendation and increased the vanilla to 3 teaspoons and I also used allspice and cinnamon. I baked it for about 3 hours and stirred occassionally for the first 2. It is sooooo yummy! I also used both dark and yellowb raisins. It has a wonderful carmalized flavor and color and is very smooth.",

First we added 1/3 cup of \"Half and Half\" (in addition to the milk). We used whole milk. We stirred the mixture every 10 minutes during the first hour of cooking. Finally we reduced the cooking time to 2 hours 20 minutes. Our pudding was creamy and custard-like and had a carmelized finish on top. We really enjoyed it and have decided that it will become our new family's (just married) Christmas dinner tradition.",

But the taste is great~  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and left out the raisins.  I saw several reviews that said it came out dry, so I tried it in a glass baking dish with a cover and the rice came out perfectly!!  I think the key to the creamy texture is in stirring it often.  YUM... First time ever making rice pudding, so glad i found your recipe!! Thanks!",

However, I'm not sure if I did something wrong - I stirred it several times during baking, and it started out with that perfect smooth custard texture, but by the end of the baking time, the milk/egg mixture had seperated and curdled.  Still a wonderful tatste though.\r\n\r\n***a note on the curdling***\r\nI tried this recipe a second time, and this time placed the baking dish in a hot water bath, and cooked at 275.  I was told that boiling is what causes the curdling.  So cook lower and longer, stir often, and use a water bath.  This time I had no curdling.",
