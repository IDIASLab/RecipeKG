Also I had pudding cups so I mixed 2 chocolate pudding cups in, then grated a bit of chocolate candy bar over the top as a garnish. Best way to make it seems to be using cupcake holders in a cupcake pan, put layer of fruit filling in, add this cream cheesecake until 3/4 full, top with oatmeal cookie, freeze. Take out, remove cupcake wrapper, place on plate with fruit side up and let thaw for individual cheesecakes. My husband has informed me the best way to eat this is rolled up in a pancake topped with fruit for his version of a blintz.",

At any rate it's quick and convenient - which works for me being a full time working woman. I took it to a potluck last night and it was all gone.",

If we have company then I add some cherry pie filling to the cut piece of pie. If I use the lime I don't use any fruit with it.
