My first batch took about 17 minutes to get done (I had them on the top rack) but they were a little overdone. I did my second batch for 13 minutes on the middle rack and they got done perfectly. Also- it seems silly but I used my pointer finger instead of my thumb to make the imprint and the cookies looked way better. The pointer finger makes a more even hole especially when making such small cookies. Very tasty! I didn't think it would make 4 dozen because it didn't look like a lot of dough but I got 45 cookies out of mine. I would have had 48 if I'd made my first batch the correct size. I didn't plan for the dough to expand as much as it did.",
