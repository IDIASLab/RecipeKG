It is the only cake I use when doing cake sculpting, and works very well in the 2 piece cake molds. The lowest ribbon it has ever worn, when entered into baking competitions is a Blue Ribbon, and it has gotten as high as Best of Show at a State Fair.",

For some reason I have a tendency to make a lot of pound cakes and I've tried a good many of them.  This recipe, while very good, is not my favorite. It's a beautiful cake in terms of  texture, density and crumb. It's also very rich and moist,  which was to be expected with the whipping cream and so many eggs. But it's almost TOO rich and eggy for a pound cake - 4-6 eggs, I've found, is perfect.  I like that yellow \"egginess\" in a yellow layer cake, but didn't like it here.  Also, it was a little too heavy on the vanilla for my tastes.  Beware, this cake IS yellow, so keep that in mind if you're a doing a wedding cake or other cake where you want it to be more white.",

If you like an old fashioned dense moist and flavorful pound cake then this is the cake for you. Like other reviewers I was nervous about the amount of vanilla called for but I am so glad that I used the full amount. It gives great flavor without being over powering. This pound cake is clearly deserving of more than 5 stars. Thank you for a truly WONDERFUL recipe - one that I will look forward to making again and again.",

I creamed the butter and sugar mixture for a good 6-7 minutes in my stand mixer, then beat the butter/sugar/egg mixture for another 4-5 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I also added a scant teaspoon of almond extract. Since this cake is so deliciously rich, I'm not sure I'd want to serve it with a typical amount of buttercream frosting. I covered the cake with a very thin layer of buttercream and fondant; any more than that would've been too much, to me.",
