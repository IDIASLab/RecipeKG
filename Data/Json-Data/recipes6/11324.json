The second time, I used a rice flour I bought from an asian market...it's made in Thailand, and it is ground superfine (it was rice flour, not to be confused with sweet rice flour).  It worked much better, and it tasted like the real deal. This is an excellent recipe, as long as you use superfine rice flour. (I've started using the superfine rice flour for all baked goods, and it makes a HUGE difference.)------------------------------------------------------------ Also, try adjusting the flours to 1 3/4 cup Thai rice flour and 1/2 tapioca flour.  I just did a side by side comparison of this (chocolate cake version) and a boxed Pillsbury chocolate cake.  The texture of the gf cake is pretty good (no longer the chewy texture of the original recipe.)",

This recipe pops up everywhere on the internet when you search for a GF yellow cake and it receives around a two star rating.  I agree with that.  The taste is pretty terrible/funky and you must offset it with major frosting/candy/coolwhip etc. to make it edible.  Today's picture made me laugh because that's literally what you need to do in order to eat this cake.  It is also extremely spongy and by day 2 it was difficult to use my fork and enjoy a slice....the texture is just weird.  I understand that GF recipes are hard to come by but don't just settle for mediocrity.  I will continue my search for the perfect GF yellow cake and I hope you do as well.  Until then enjoy some GF brownies or chocolate cake because those desserts are easily found via the internet and even the non celiacs in my house request my desserts.....just not this one!",
