On the starter recipe link on the recipe and it says at the bottom you can freeze this starter. I always do and it comes out great.",

I was always bothered with the instant pudding mix in the ingredients, so I made a substitution this last time.  I replaced it with two mashed, ripe bananas, and threw in a few pinches of extra flour in fear that the batter would be too wet.  I also use all organic and natural ingredients as much as possible to make it a little healthier.  The bread came out fantastic with the bananas in place of the pudding, very moist and delicious.  Everyone I gave some too loved it as well.  Next time I will try using apples as I saw some people suggested.",
