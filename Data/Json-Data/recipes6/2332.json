I did only use 1/2 of the Chinese Five Spice, b/c I know it can be strong, and that was perfect for us.  Also, I used a bit less Sriracha b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for my girls. The family really enjoyed these. I think they'd be great not only as an appetizer, but as a main dish served over rice, which is how I plan on making them next time. Thanks for sharing. :)",

Only thing different was i made homemade meatballs rather than frozen. used 6 lbs ground beef, 26 ounces evaporated milk, 4 cups oatmeal, and 4 eggs. mix all together, form your meatballs, bake at 350 for 1 hour. super easy and you get better meatballs than the frozen junk that uses terrible quality meat",
