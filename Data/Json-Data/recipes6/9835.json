I used a Pillsbury refrigerator dough and prebaked it for 7 minutes then added topping and baked for only about ten more minutes. I also had to substitute the cheese using a mix of Monterey jack and mozzarella. The pizza dough turned out very crisp and seemed to make it less messy to eat but those who don't like crisp crust may not want to try this type of dough or just be sure that it's not spread too thin. My eight year old liked it okay. I loved it. Watch the cilantro it can be overpowering. I would use less than the recipe calls for.",

First as always I marinated my chicken in buttermilk all day(if no buttermilk 1cup milk 1tbsp white vinegar or lemon juice) this makes for some extra moist chicken.. Then I sprinkled olive oil in a skillet and sauteed my chicken until brown on all sides. Then I added all the ingredients and simmered for a half hour until the chicken was cooked. This eliminated getting two pans dirty. I just kept sampling right out of the skillet before it even made it to the pizza. I used mozzarella cheese as my cheese because that's my taste preference.

Also unlike mozarella gouda tends to not melt particularly well. Finished product didnt look very appealing because the sauce turned a dark reddy brown almost black and the chesse didnt melt well it just went crispy. Edible but recipe needs a lot of work.",

I also caramelized about 5 onions and that on the pizza as well. I added some mushrooms and a little bit of goat cheese along with the sliced red onion and baked it until golden and delicious.

Also note that barbeque sauces are naturally sweet so if you get a honey flavoured sauce you definitely don't need much more sugar. Even if you do add too much sugar though it'll still taste fantastic! I like to add a red pepper to the top as well as season the chicken with sweet Hungarian paprika. It gives the pizza more colour and even more flavour!",
