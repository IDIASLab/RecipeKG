First we use bone-in thinner chops, \"cheap\" chops and they came out tough the 1st time, 2nd time we like extra sauce so I doubled the sauce recipe, but it was even saltier than the 1st time. Finally my husband let me try a 3rd time, so this is what I did. Brine your chops! 4 cups of water w/2 Tbls. of table salt and 2 Tbls (packed) brown sugar. Brine for 2 hrs. I use olive oil. Sear the chops 2 1/2 min each side, remove from pan and set aside. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and roughly 1/2 cup of minced onion, and saute'. Whisk 1 cup beef broth, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 4 Tbls. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper. Return the chops to the pan and simmer, covered 3-5 min on each side. Remove chops again and cover with foil. Thicken the sauce with corn starch. Serve with egg noodles and greenbeans. Try it, you will love it!! I promise! Even my \"cheap\" chops came out succulent, juicy and tender!! Definitely a keeper for my recipe box!!",

Also,  I did reduce  the cooking time drastically, knowing boneless pork chops cook quickly and dry out quickly too.   Alas, they were still tough.  No fault of this recipe necessarily, although I can't imagine what cooking these for 30-35 minutes would do to them.  I just would consider a pork cut with a little more fat if I was to make this again.",

I used low sodium soy sauce, so I did not experience the saltiness some of the reviews mentioned.  When I returned the chops (1 1/2\" thickness) to the pan, I simmered for 10 minutes on each side and they were perfectly done.  To thicken the sauce, I added a little Wondra\u00ae and it was the consistency I was looking for.  Served these with 'Smashed Cauliflower Side Dish' and 'Chik-Fil-A\u00ae Slaw (Copycat)' both from AR.  The meal was delicious and I will be using this recipe again.",

I already had one open in need of use.  Left out additional 2 teaspoons of oil.  Due to reviews on overcooking the pork chops, I quick fried them and took out.  Made the sauce and then added the chops back in just for maybe 5 minutes to absorb flavor and took out again.  Added the cornstarch/water mix.  It thickened up nicely.  (If it's too thick, add a little more broth.)  Tossed in the chops to coat at the end.  I enjoyed them very much and will make again.  I used Thin pork chops with bones.  Very tender and would definitely make these again.  I would extend the cooking time if the chops were thicker.",

I had lovely inch thick chops which after searing and then covering (even tho I removed after only 10 minutes) were overdone.  Would suggest leaving lid off pan and watching carefully.  If you sear, 5-7\" should be enough.  Will def make again after tweaking to our tastes.  Other reviewers suggestion of serving over/with egg noodles was perfect.",

I knew dinnertime was going to be rushed, so I made this early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it, and simply reheated it when it was time for dinner.  I did double the sauce and cut back just slightly on the lite soy sauce I used.  My sauce thickened nicely, so I didn\u2019t need to use all of the cornstarch/water slurry.  I browned my chops on medium high heat for four minutes on each side.  After browning, they were almost done, so I only needed to simmer them for a few minutes when I reheated them.  The only change I\u2019d made next time, would be to cut back the soy sauce a little further and just use 3 T. in my double recipe of sauce (for two chops).  These were very good and the sauce gives the chops a beautiful sheen.  I\u2019d also like to try this sauce on grilled pork tenderloin!",
