I didn't have cranberry sauce so I just sprinkled a few Craisins on top with some toasted Pecans and warm Maple Syrup. My problem with this recipe is that it is super thick batter. It took forever to cook and stuck really badly in the waffle iron after I brushed it with veg. oil. I ended up adding an additional 2/3c. milk and another egg. I got really frustrated trying to get the first one out. I had to practically bathe the waffle iron in vegetable oil just to get it to only get mildly stuck. BUT I will say the taste redeemed this recipe. I would try it again and hopefully remember to modify it. Five stars for taste but 4 stars because this batter really was a pain in the behind to use in the waffle iron.",
