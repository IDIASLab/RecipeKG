Frustrated, I did some research and started giving him this homemade dog food twice a day. He is back to a normal weight, and is very happy! Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Serve without bones; give separately as a treat as desired and use caution.",

Getting him to eat enough food has been a big cause of stress for me since we adopted him. Recently I learned that on top of this, his old \"favorite\" food is nutritionally incomplete, so I found this recipe. Before it would take hours of picking at his food to finish a meal, but with this recipe? He's OBSESSED, and so am I! He finishes eating in under a minute and his body language and mood seems revitalized, like his little body had been begging for nutrients and finally got what it needed. Honestly its a godsend, and I appreciate the peace of mind it gives me knowing he's getting good food I can trust and that he Loves it so much.",
