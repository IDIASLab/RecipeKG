I was a little worried because they did get a little hard around the edges and it overflowed into my oven when I baked them...but I read in previous reviews that it had happened to other people so that was a relief!  I baked them then let them cool, then covered them and cut them the next day.  They were so great! Rave reviews from everyone at my party! When you're pouring the filling over the crust, it looks like it will be too much, but it works just great!  Will use a disposable pan next time because of the overflow.  GREAT RECIPE!!!",

I cooked for about 33-35 minutes unstead of 20 and allowed them to set up and cool before cutting - they were not at all runny.  If making the recipe as called for in the large pan I'd do 40 minutes.  Also, I found that putting each bar on a  small cupcake liner paper was very nice for serving them as they can be crumbly.",

For the filling I also used 2/3 cup light corn syrup a little less than one cup of brown sugar and an ounce of unsweetened chocolate. Since I didn't have all of the pecans on hand I used a mixture of walnuts and almonds along with the pecans. The pan size requested in the recipe should have been slightly bigger as there was a small amount of crust and filling that remained which I ended up throwing away.",

Didn't have all the corn syrup I needed so substituted honey and maple syrup to make up the additional 3/4 cup and that substitute didn't seem to do anything to the recipe but perhaps make it more flavorful. The crust on these are to die for...buttery and sinful. I actually cooked the end product about 12 - 15 more and that didn't seem to do any damage either (I was paranoid about it \"setting\" due to my past pecan pie disasters!) though it did make the crust on the rim a little more chewy and crunchy (caramelized it a bit more--I actually liked that part better...). All in all a definite winner. One of the best dessert recipes I've used from allrecipes.....yum!",

The half sheet cake pan with sides is the perfect size...about 13\" x 17\" x 1 1/4\"...no run over! You do have to press down the crust before baking but there seem to be just the rightr amount of crust for us. I traded out some of the white sugar for brown. 1 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup dark sugar seems to work well. And one last change the cooking time. It is way off. I did mine for 45 minutes. It was just starting to bubble around the edges when I took it out this was also the time it started to brown up a bit. I was worried about how much this recipe yielded and if it would freeze well. I never got a chance to find out it went so quick! None of the problems of pecan pie and a protable size. I think this is going to be added to my Thanksgiving menu to cut and send home to sweeten up the leftovers! Excellent recipe - Thanks Marietta for sharing!",
