I doubled the cocoa and it was definitely not chocolate flavored but it WAS delicious(whatever the flavor was!) I didn't have an egg and I wanted to use up my starter so I used 1 cup of starter instead of 1/2 cup my mom couldn't believe there was no egg because it was moist and had a wonderful texture. Will make it again but maybe I'll triple the cocoa this time.",
