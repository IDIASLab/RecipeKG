They did not sell Knorr rice pilaf at my store so I bought a different brand that had a longer cook time but it worked ok. I was worried that the chicken would be underdone but since it sat for a bit it was good and not chewy. Both kids and hubby liked it. Nice all in one meal I will make it again. Adults ate it with some sriracha.",
