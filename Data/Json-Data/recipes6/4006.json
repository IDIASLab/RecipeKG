        "description": "These are moist peanut butter cupcakes with mini peanut butter cups in them, topped with melted milk chocolate and chopped peanuts. I was looking for a chocolate-peanut butter cupcake recipe that wasn't too high in calories, but were still a decent size and delicious. I couldn't seem to find what I was looking for so decided to create my own! These were a hit with all my family and friends! Hope you all enjoy. Yum yum yum!",
