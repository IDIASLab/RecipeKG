I just managed the get the dough into a ball pressed some of the filling onto the surface of the dough and decided to try baking it anyways. It was wonderful! My husband myself and our two young children polished off most of the loaf at dinner and finished the rest for breakfast the next morning. Next time I make it (which will be soon) I'll just knead it altogether and not worry about keeping the filling in the middle. Do try this delicious bread. We ate it with souvlaki and a Greek salad.",

I did use Black and Green Olives because I didn't have Kalamata...although I do love Kalamta!! I let it rise for a full hour on the second rise after shaping. The end result was soft and moist...packed with flavor! I'll try the addition of some olive brine in place of some water next time and maybe a little rosemary. I also only used 1 tsp of salt in the dough because I was using such salty olives! Wonderful recipe-thanks.",

I was able to improve it a bit by drizzling olive oil on top and coating the loaf with fresh rosemary but I still won't make it again. The bread with cloves of garlic that my grocery (Albertson's) deli makes is far heartier and tastier.",
