Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly with seasoning amounts, etc.  My husband loved it.  He likes the Six Can Tortilla Soup (with a few alterations) from this site better, but it was still a thumbs up from a guy raised on meat and potatoes.  I served with a garnish of sliced green onions and warm corn muffins.  Yum!",

I wound up adding approximately 2-3 cans (4-6 cups).  Just add to your desired consistency.  Don\u2019t even try to puree the tomato/bean mix in your blender---go with your processor.  I rinsed all the black beans but dumped the corn in undrained.  This soup is highly recommended and a meal in itself!",

I noticed some reviews said it was too salty, so I made sure to drain and rinse all the canned ingredients and added salt to taste at the end.  I had about 8oz of firm tofu sitting in my fridge so I cubed it up and threw it in.  When I served the soup I sprinkled a teaspoon of Nutritional Yeast on top.  Nutritional Yeast gives the soup a great cheesy flavor and is great for vegans because it gives you B12 which is usually found in animal sources!!",

I adjusted the spices to our tastes, left out celery since it's been banned from our house, and added some of the tomato to the soup before blending the can (to give some more texture). The soup is good, but not amazing. Maybe some different chilies/peppers would put it above the rest. Still, needed quite a bit of tweaking, so 3 stars for the recipe as is.
