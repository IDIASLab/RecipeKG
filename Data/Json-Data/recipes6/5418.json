I used kale instead of cabbage and I added some edamame because I had some in the freezer. The sauce was a little thick so I thinned it out just a hair with some more soy and vinegar. I made this for lunch at work through the week and it gets better the longer it sits. I did roast my tofu for about 45 minutes because I like the texture better that way.",
