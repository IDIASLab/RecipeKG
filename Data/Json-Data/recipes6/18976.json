Here's a tip: use the spam can as a mold by CAREFULLY cutting the bottom out of it with an x-acto knife. Also, it helps if you use \"pre-toasted\" nori sheets. Untoasted nori can be tough. Another tip to keep the rice from sticking to your hands; have a bowl of water handy to wet your hands and the musubi mold.",

I've been making musubi for years but have never made it with the marinade. Very good! Like others suggested, cook on low heat. That sugar will start to caramelize real quick and burn if your heat is too high. I put some furikake mix in with the rice just for some extra flavor. You can get furikake mix from many asian food stores. I usually get the basic 'nori komi' mix (great over steamed rice too). I make big batches and individually saran-wrap them. Perfect on the go snack. Regular steamed rice works fine. No need to soak for four hours. Just wash it and cook it like you would normally.",

                "reviewBody": "After going to Hawaii for the first time a few years ago, my fiance and I fell in love with spam musubi. I'm so glad that I found this recipe. BUT, I really don't like oyster sauce (I did a test batch of 2 spam slices marinated as directed in this recipe, and didn't like the way it came out) and after doing a bit more research for other musubi recipes online, I decided to substitute the oyster sauce with mirin (Japanese sweet cooking wine that you can find at any Asian grocery store/market). YUMMY YUM YUM!!! It was perfect, just like in Hawaii! My fiance couldn't get enough! (And neither could I!) TIPS: You don't have to use sushi rice, regular rice is just fine. When you cook the marinated spam slices, be sure to do it at a low heat, as the sugar in the marinade really does make the spam burn very easily. When I assembled my musubi, I kept a small bowl of water next to me to continually wet my fingers and the musubi maker (as well as using it to seal the seaweed strips). Speaking of the seaweed, before you cut it into strips, be sure to \"toast\" it - simply take each sheet and quickly make three-four passes over your stove burner and it will toast fine (don't let it linger over the burner or have the burner set too high or it will burn). I'll definitely keep this recipe as one of my favorites.",

I marinaded the spam in teriyaki,  and cut nori into 1 1/2 inch strips.  I also bought a musubi mold, which I got in Maui, but you can buy them online. Dip mold in water before molding each musubi, it will make removal much easier.  Also lay a piece of plastic wrap on flat surface, lay nori on top, center mold and fill with rice then spam and then rice again, press.  Remove mold, wrap seaweed around rice and wrap in plastic.  I gave my sister two musubi's to take home...one for her and for her husband...she ate both!  Mahalo!",

I put the rice into the rice cooker... add water and push the button.  Perfect rice in less than 30 minutes.    A fun way to shape the rice so it fits the spam slices just right,  is to pat the rice out on a sheet of parchment paper to the thickness you want.   Then use the spam can like a cookie cutter to cut the rice.   (Works best if you cut off both the top and bottom of the can)",

When I tried out this recipe I was surprised that the \"secret sauce\" is a combination of something so commonly found in a Chinese kitchen. A few suggestions - 1. use low sodium SPAM and soy sauce. You can enjoy it even more without drinking tones of water afterward. 2. cook SPAM in low heat and watch carefully. With the sauces and sugar it burns really fast. 3. If you aren't use to wrap sushi and molding cooked rice scoop the rice into a piece of plastic wrap and press to form the rice. This will give you a nice a firm rice cake without the mess. 4. Adding a little bit of sesome seeds to the rice if you like. Love this recipe. Definitely a keeper!",
