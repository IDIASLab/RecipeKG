It made the perfect glaze that I then just poured over the cooked carrots.  That seemed to work to solve the problem with the glaze that many others reported.",

                "reviewBody": "I just made these for dinner, having tweaked a recipe from Sue Spitler.  The ones I just made were so good I thought I'd share the difference.  Cook the carrots in a little water.  In a separate pan make the glaze: 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (at the very least), 1/4 teaspoon allspice, 1/4 teaspoon ground mace, a little pad of butter to aid against sticking to the pan, a few pinches of parsley, 3 or 4 dollops of ORANGE MARMELADE.  Heat and stir till thick.  You may want to let the glaze cool a little bit because it gets really hot and stays hot longer than expected.  The marmelade lends some little chunks of oranges and I think is super super ... super tasty.  Obviously NOT for those on a diet... the less you cook the carrots the more carrot flavor... the more you cook the carrots, the easier to disguise them (for children or those who usually don't like cooked carrots).  Though I tweaked the recipe, I think Ms. Spitler is still right that you can also use yams and/or beets for this.  I think the glaze is sooo good that it could be used with ice cream or... basically in dishes replacing caramel.  Yum.  (serves about 4 people as a side dish)",

I didn't have any orange juice but I remembered I had some concentrated in a can in the freezer from another recipe. While the carrots were cooking I went ahead and scooped out about a forth of a cup put that in a small bowl added the brown sugar salt and just about a TBLS of water and about 1/2-1 tsp. of cornstarch and mixed it all up blending well. I also remember another reviewer adding cinnamon so add a very small amount about an 1/8 of a tsp. When the carrots were done steaming took out the steamer basket and poured out the water put the butter in and let it melt and poured in the orange juice/sugar mixture. Stirred well to blend and added the carrots. As it heated it thickened and produced the most magnificent glaze I have ever tasted. Every single carrot was just beautifully covered in this thick glaze. I will always use this recipe!! I think the concentrated oj made it a little more pronounced and loved it. Thank you so much for sharing this. Goes wonderful with pork chops or any main course for that matter.",
