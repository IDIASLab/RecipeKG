I tried per recipe and then added a sprinkle of pink salt to some.. I preferred it with a little added salt. I don't know how well these cooked at this size in this period of time. It may have been just me but these gave me a bit of an upset stomach.. like they were underripe and undercooked. And yes my plantain was yellow per the recipe.. just FYI. Maybe don't eat too many of them until you are sure if they will bother you.",
