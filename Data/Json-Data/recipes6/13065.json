Even though I've thought about 'retiring' from this exercise because it means torturous sessions toiling in the kitchen like a sweaty elf I can't simply because the results and the awed looks it generates from other folks are just that good! They're so gorgeous that really they should be known as America's Next Top Cookie. One little thing I've learned is to keep the dough as cold as possible when rolling - even if that means keeping your kitchen window/door open. Another tip: cut the small star (the one that goes in the center of half of the cookies) once you've placed them on the cookie sheet. It's a lot easier to pry the excess centre dough with a small knife that it is trying to transfer the hollowed star shape onto the sheet intact. Finally I use red and green decorator sugar to give it a more festive look - this year I'm going to try some icing sugar too.",

At this point your dough will have softened up again so put the dough back in the fridge for a few (10-20) minutes. The dough will then be stiff enough to work with and you can simply peel the dough off the parchment paper and place onto your baking sheets. Take the remaining dough trimmings and repeat the process! A variation that you MUST try is to use Nutella in place of the jam - to die for!!",
