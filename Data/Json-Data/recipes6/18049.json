The one thing i would change is that i would fold in chopped strawberries into the cream cheese mixture and i would pour the sauce over the cut slices of pie instead of over the whole pie. I had found the sauce a little too runny it could be that i blended it too much that or i would try to thicken it with some constartch. will be making this one again",

I could tell that my father in law was a bit disappointed when he learned that I did not make traditional strawberry pie. That was quickly replaced with raves over this dessert. He has requested this one again for Father's Day. I followed the recipe exactly except that I accidentally bought a ten inch crust instead of a nine inch. It worked just fine and the four of us ate the whole pie over two days. Yum! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I didn't over-puree the strawberry mixture and left it a little chunky as the recipe called for and it turned out great! Thanks so much!",
