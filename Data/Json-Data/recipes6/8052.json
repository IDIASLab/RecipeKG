Maybe the sauce should be removed from the cook dish and contents added to a sauce pan to be heated up and add about 1.5 teaspoons to 1 tbsp of corn starch mixed with a little water and added to the sauce to thicken it up.    \n\nOverall, not bad for an Asian knock-off dish, but for me what is lacking is green vegetables that are baked with the chicken.  That would improve it even more.",
