I put it in a ziploc bag and add 1 fresh clove of garlic grated and 4 green onions sliced. I sprinkled brown sugar on the pineapple and grilled that for about 4 minutes. I used a thicker teriyaki sauce to brush on my chicken at the end. It was also from Kikkoman but had sesame seeds in it. I took a taste of the chicken when it came off the grill and it was fantastic however; when I put it on my sandwich I felt the mayo overpowered it and all I tasted was mayo and not the great teriyaki flavors. I will definitely skip the mayo next time. I also didn't use the bacon & tomato. I was out of bacon and was afraid of pairing the tomato with the pineapple but I might give it a try next time.",
