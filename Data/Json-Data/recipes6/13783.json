Be advised though - the heat from the Cayenne tends to take a bit of time to really flavor the salad. If you are not sure how much heat you like add the recommended amount let it sit for 20 minutes and taste. We used 1 tablespoon of sugar and it was just right. Will be making this often. Next version will be to add some pasta! Great recipe!",
