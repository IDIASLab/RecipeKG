The dough is about the texture of shortbread when you're scooping it up (and was very hard to resist - okay, so I had a few spoonfuls) and bakes into soft puffy cookies.  They won't flatten much while cooking.  You're not really looking for them to brown so much as for the surface to dry and not be sticky.  Just follow the timing.  8 minutes had them done outside and slightly gooey inside (mmm!) and 10 had them done through but still soft and pillowy (mmm either way!).  They're really similar in texture to some banana cookies I made once.  I followed this recipe exactly and mixed it in the kitchen aid with the paddle (with a separate bowl for dry ingredients).  I used clover honey and they came out great.  I'm going to have another one now...",

Second I subbed in coconut oil for half of the butter. I also added slightly more walnuts and more salt than the recipe called for -- about 1.25 c walnuts and about 1 tsp salt. The results are absolutely delicious and perfectly puffy/chewy and not as sweet as most cookies...which is to my liking but might not be sweet enough for others. If others try these with maple syrup in place of honey add in some extra sugar. I might make another batch later and do a thing where I roll each ball of dough in granulated sugar and then flatten it with the bottom of a glass.",

They were a little messy in preparation (nothing a little lick of the fingers and a quick hand washing between batches can't fix) but they were simple to make and an absolute delight to serve. Kids and adults loved the unique dynamic of the cookie's sweetness and texture. They emptied out all of the boxes I brought with haste and were begging for the recipe. I finally just printed out dozens of copies and left them in the foyer where anyone could pick them up if they wanted it. Needless to say despite my endless rant FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!",
