Because it makes so much, you can just pull out what you want to cook, punch the rest down and put it back in the fridge.  You can also make cinnamon rolls out of this recipe as well.  Roll it out into a rectangle, spread butter on it, sprinkle it with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I also fine chopped some apples and pecans and put in it as well.  Roll up along the long side, pinch and seal the edge, then cut into  inch wide rounds.  Place cut side down on parchment paper and let them rise.  Pop them in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Mix 2 T melted butter, 1 t. vanilla, 1 T milk and enough powdered sugar to make a thick spread and drizzle it on the rolls while they are still hot. Yum!",

Of course...it is going to be made way more often than once a year...I'd be hard pressed to pick out which was Cafe Du Monde's (fresh in the cafe) and which was this recipe in a taste test.    There is a STEP MISSING from the recipe and it is crucial!!  After you have allowed the dough to rise punch out the dough flatten and then allow to rise a SECOND time...only needs to be for an hour.   This will ensure the beignets are full and fluffy inside and not flat and well...not fluffy inside.  Cheers,  Dane",

I didn't feel the flavor was too bland as some readers suggested, but it does require more powdered sugar then the recipe calls for.  I'll probably add a little vanilla to enhance the flavor next time.  Sorry I missed the hint about putting the powdered sugar in a brown bag.  I had powdered sugar all over my counter and floor.  Definitely a keeper!  P.S.  Since I was unable to use all the dough in one batch, I stored the remainder in the refrigerator overnight.  The second batch of beignets came out just as crisp and moist as the first.   day.",

                "reviewBody": "Anything French in nature can be daunting...(even French toast for me sometimes)!  However, these aren't really that hard to make!    Here are some things I learned from this recipe which may seem like a no-brainer to many, but I wasn't really sure having not ever fried in oil before.    *Use a quart saucepan - not a frying pan.  I know, seems silly, but maybe this will help someone.    *I didn't use an entire packet of yeast, but am wondering if it really would have mattered much.  It calls for 2 1/4 tsp and there's a bit more than that in the packet.    *Don't just wait for the beignets to float to the top, they really need to plump.  Make sure you flip them over so one side won't over cook.    *Don't cut the pieces too small - they'll cook too quickly and not plump.    *I didn't refrigerate the first \"test\" round and they turned out 90% correct.  The second batch - fine - after refrigeration.    *Am certain that butter would be fine instead of shortening.  It's really just needing the fat component in the recipe at that point.    *I used wax paper and a dusting of flour to pat out my dough.  I used a pizza cutter to make the squares.    *Be sure to use a paper bag with powdered sugar to toss/shake the cooked beignets.  Super easy and less mess.  Don't use a ziploc - they will stick to the sides.    I hope this helps other beignet novices out there!  I will make these again each year for Mardi Gras!",
