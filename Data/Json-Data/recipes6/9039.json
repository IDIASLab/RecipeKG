Plus, it is healthy and quite pretty on the plate next to the main course.  I did cook it a five minutes or so longer,  as I like my vegetables a bit softer. I did not cook the asparagus first. I, like the other reviewer, just tossed them in to the mix and roasted all the vegetables together. For the leftovers, I tossed them with whole wheat pasta after saut\u00e9ing them very quickly with more oil, a bit more garlic and a splash of white wine..I then added some pasta water into the side sauce. I actually enjoyed the vegetables a lot after tossing them with the pasta and parmesan cheese. Sauteing the veggies again though will make them naturally softer That didn't bother me. They were still quite yummy.  I will make this again and look forward to the leftovers! Thank you for sharing",
