This is almost exactly the way my mom taught me to make German pancakes.

When I would ask my mom how to do it she would say, \"eggs-flour-milk, it's easy.\" But she never used measurements! She just knew how to do it. So my attempts always came out  like rubbery discs.\nOne thing I would like to say about Barbarella's recipe is that those tablespoons of flour should be on the heaping side. I also added a few grinder spins of rose petal infused salt.\nThe thing about these is you can make them as fancy or as plain as you like, use the leftovers sliced up in soup, make them savory or sweet...try filling them with leftover cranberry sauce!\nThe trick to flipping these in the pan is to wait until the uncooked portion looks dry, loosen the sides all around the skillet, then with a wide spatula flip. A non-stick pan helps, but my mother made these things in a cast iron skillet!",

I have a small frying pan that is great for making one pancake at a time so I used it and found it was much easier to get that round shape. I also used 1/4 cup of flour instead of the amount suggested in the recipe to mellow out some of that eggy taste. After the alterations I believe that these are the best pancakes I have ever had.
