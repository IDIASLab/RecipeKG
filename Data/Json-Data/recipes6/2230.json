Left out garlic.  I cooked the bacon and onion, added cabbage and apples like it said, and then when I added the vinegar and sugar mixture, I tossed it and coated it in the pan and then added to the crock pot on low for 4-5 hours and the cabbage and apples got really nice and tender.  The things I'd do differently next time are add only one apple and use a Granny smith l ( I accidentally used a sweeter variety and it was too sweet for my liking ).",
