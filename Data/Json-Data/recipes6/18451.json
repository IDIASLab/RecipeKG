Normally, I have a difficult time making good pie dough, but this one was absolutely delightful, both to work with and to eat. :)  I didn't have time to chill it 4 hours, so I only chilled it for 1 - and it still was a dream to roll out.\r\n\r\nI used my own frozen raspberries, blueberries, and rhubarb in this recipe, and the fresh apples called for.  By the time I put that into my pie crusts, there simply wasn't any more room for the strawberries - so I left them out, and didn't even miss them.  One thing I would suggest: serve this pie when it's totally cooled off, *not* warm from the oven.  I served it warm, and the juice from all the berries made it really runny.  I was a little upset at first, thinking I didn't add enough flour or something, but when it cooled off, it was a perfect consistency and thickness.\r\n\r\nI will be saving the pie dough recipe for all my pie recipes from now on, and I'll DEFINITELY be making this recipe again!",

I halved the recipe for one pie and used my three fruits and as one reviewer suggested used 4T cornstarch in place of the tapioca since I didn't have any. I also used a storebought crust just being lazy I guess. So yummy not too sweet a little on the tart side from my nectarines it's just a good all around recipe that you can tailor to whatever you have on hand.",

I have made 5 of them already.  I have to say that the pie crust is very easy to make, as well as light and flaky, but it was missing the flavor that butter gives to a crust, so I think I will use some butter in it next time.

I subbed 2tsp corn starch for the tapioca and went with my own crust and this? Is just too yummy. Another commenter said that this pie is very forgiving of substitutions and I have to agree. Like other commenters, I also agree that this pie needs to cool before you eat it or it will be runny. This might also be a good recipe to use for just a one berry pie - either way, I have a feeling this is going to become a new summer staple around my house!",
