Direct quotes from him: \"This is the best thing to ever come out of a crockpot in the history of cooking\", \"I would eat my way out of a bathtub of this\". LOL! Seriously, if we weren't already engaged, this stuff would have made him propose on the spot. :) The only change I made was to shred the chicken after 5 hours and then put it back into the crockpot to let it soak up all the sauce for another 2 hours. I served the meat on toasted Kaiser rolls with melted pepperjack cheese. Thank you very much, needless to say this will be a VERY regularly made recipe in our house! :)",

I used a 2.5# bag of frozen boneless chicken tenders and tossed in two 12 oz. bottles of Frank's Wing Sauce, a whole package of ranch dressing mix & 1/4 cup butter.  I let it all cook together instead of adding sauce and butter at the end.  This was plenty saucy and I think I will go with 3# of chicken next time (the leftovers are great)!  Also great to use on the buffalo chicken pizza recipe on this site. I served this on crusty french bread with cheese and pepper rings.  I am making this for the next party that comes around and I know it will be a hit.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!",

I had a problem with my hot sauce evaporating about half way through the process, so I ended up adding the rest of the 23 oz bottle, which made it a bit too spicy . I enjoyed the little zip the ranch powder added to the chicken. Next time I make this I'll probably use some chicken broth for the first half of the cooking time and then add the hot sauce. I served the sandwiches with colby-jack cheese, shredded lettuce, and ranch dressing. I'm planning to use the leftovers for Buffalo Chicken pizza. Thanks for another great variation on buffalo chicken.",

The second time I made it I used a 2 1/2lb bag frozed chicken tenderloins, 1 bottle of Franks Wing Sauce, a whole packet of ranch, 1/4c butter and 2 8oz whipped cream cheese (to tone down the spice). I put the cream cheese and butter at the bottom of the crock pot, then put the chicken on top and poured the bottle of wing sauce over it along with the packet of ranch. My family LOVED it!! The cream cheese really toned down the spiceyness! We had this o n samdwichs and I bought Boboli pizza crust, brushed it with olive oil and fresh minced garlic, baked it for 10 minutes, then spread ranch dressing on crust, spead buffalo chicken on next and topped with mozz. cheese. That was fabulous!!! ",

I also think it could do with a little less cook time because it does (especially with all white meat) dry out the meat and the end result for me was sauced dry bland breast meat.

Cook on low for 3 hours and shred.  Add remainder of hot sauce and cook for 1 more hour. Add more ranch (to desired taste) and butter and serve. I like them with cheddar cheese on onion rolls or toasted hoagie rolls. Cooking with the entire bottle of hot sauce makes them very spicy.",
