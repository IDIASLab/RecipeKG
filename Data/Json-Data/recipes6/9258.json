It got rave reviews, even one 7 year old who doesn't eat anything mixed together!  I followed some other reviewers advice and changed it in the following ways: I used 4 boneless skinless breasts and boiled them in plain water.  Instead of the homemade broth, I used 1-2 cup chicken broth.  I used a Tbsp dried chopped onion instead of onion powder, one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of broccoli.  I also added about 2 cups of frozen broccoli florets. I omitted the celery and replaced it with 1/2 tsp celery seed. I varied one batch with jasmine rice instead of plain rice too (it turned out great and gave me an idea for a curry version of this recipe... I will post once I try and figure it out!).  This is a great recipe and I will definately make it again, and again (good for potlucks too).",

However, I gave it four stars instead of five because I made a few changes. I only use two to three chicken breasts and don't make my own homemade broth. I also use two cups of rice (brown rice, which I cooked in store-bought chicken broth instead of adding broth to the mixture), one can of cream of chicken and one of cream of celery, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of dried minced onion instead of the onion powder, and I added about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of chopped broccoli. I also mixed a cup of sharp cheddar in with the rest of the ingredients and then topped the whole thing with another cup of cheddar and the crushed crackers. I skipped adding the butter to the crackers. It turned out pretty darn good, and my whole family enjoyed it. It was also pretty easy to make, and is fairly easy to adjust to suit your tastes so I'd definitely recommend it.",

I cut up and fried the chicken in some olive oil before adding it. I also used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of broccoli cheese (that is what I had). I added two cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I thought it turned out okay. Then yesterday when I was ready to eat the left overs I scraped of most of the crackers (so it wouldn t get too mushy) put it in the microwave warmed it just enough to be able to stir it. I added a can of mushroom soup another six oz of sour crm and about cup of chicken broth mixed it all together again and put new crackers on top. I put it back into a smaller casserole dish. And the left overs (about half the 9 X 13) turned out awesome. It was so better then the first day. I will definitely make this again. I plan on making it on the weekend with the homemade broth. But don t pass this recipe just because of the time to make the homemade broth. It is worth it if you use the store bought broth.",
