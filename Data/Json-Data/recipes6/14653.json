Using advice from another reviewer, I didn't change a thing the first time and it was perfect. The second time, I tried it without the coconut. It is much better with the coconut IMHO! Also, 2 cups of bananas is 4 average-size bananas. This should help so you're not having to measure your bananas after they're mashed. I usually have a hard time not making my own little changes to a recipe...which is why I tried to change it the second time. Don't change a thing! This recipe is going to be my Christmas neighbor-gifts for next year! Very colorful and easy to make. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!\nP.S. Added on 8/24/07, I have now made this recipe MANY times and here are a few more helpful tips (hopefully). First, this recipe will fill three of the aluminum loaf pans that you can purchase for gift giving. Also, the last time I made this I added ALOT of pineapple. That is a big mistake! It makes the bread too gooey, so if you experiment, this is not the ingredient to increase. And one last thing. At least when I bake this, it takes around 55 minutes to be done, at least. My oven is right on, temperature wise, too. ENJOY!!",

Gave hubby one piece, gave Daughter #1 a BITE, and I've eaten 2/3 of the first loaf all by my loansome!  So glad the recipe makes 2 loaves.  I didn't have any cherries so those were left out, and I did a cup of crushed-up macadamias in lieu of the nuts listed. Only had enough ugly bananas for 1-1/2 cups, and did the 1/2-and-1/2 on the white and brown sugar combo suggested by previous cooks.  Baked in 2 glass loaf pans for about 50 minutes. When I checked on them they passed the toothpick test so I pulled them out.  Upon slicing while still hot the middle was still kinda gooey and the top sank shortly after coming out of the oven.  I don't care!  It's too good.  Next time will add more coconut and pineapple. Oh, the only pineapple I had was the dehydrated stuff from Sam's so I chopped up that until it filled 1 cup. Will do maybe 1-1/2 cups of pineapple next time. I'm not making regular banana bread anymore, this is too dang good!",

Next time I'll be prepared. I made this in 5 mini loaf pans instead, and decreased the time to 55-60 min.  Just be sure to check the center as usual.  I also made a oatmeal, sugar, cinnamon struesel for the top, and it turned out sooooo yummmmmmmy!!!  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe that I will be using MANY times to come.  I'll be sure to share it with my Mommy/Toddler Playgroup too! PS. 2 Cups bananas = 4 reg. size bananas",

The only change I made was that I toasted my walnuts first and then I put my coconut in my chopper to make it finer. I too think you could probably cut back 1/3 or even 1/2 a cup on the sugar and it would still be great. My husband really did enjoy this one.",
