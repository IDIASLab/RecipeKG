Only four stars though cause they don't look too exceptional and I had to tweak the recipe based on other member's comments. I used unsweetened chocolate to make sure it wasn't too sweet. Based on other comments about caving in I made sure not to over-beat/mix the batter and added a tsp of baking soda. I will definitely use this recipe in the future.",

I scaled the recipe to two- one for me and my man on our anniversary; and I wanted something pretty to put on the table... but in order to save these I had to put a scoop of ice cream in the big ugly holes of them and garnish with strawberries.
