A few tips from someone who's made this several times: I add a handful of chocolate chips and a handful of walnuts and it's great. One time I forgot to set my oven timer and so I had to guess whether they were done which I'm not very good at. A toothpick came out not quite clean so I let them go a little longer and then a little longer... I kept them going until the toothpick came out clean and that batch came out awfully dry. Each cut brownie would crumble on the plate. Next time I made them I experimented and threw in a little applesauce to get them a little more moist and I took them out of the oven when the toothpick was just a little shy of being clean. Very good batch! Also for some strange reason these are always much better on the second day and even on the third day. I say make a batch and enjoy a little brownie that night but save most of them for the next night. Really good recipe for serious chocolate lovers!",

I have never had trouble with my oven temperature in other recipes and I lined my pan with parchment so I'm guessing that the time should be 18-20 minutes if you want them to be gooey. Another option might be to reduce the flour by 2 Tbs. I managed to save them by melting 2 ounces of semisweet chocolate with 1 Tbs each cream and butter to make a ganache to spread over top. They are now more like a cookie and at least they taste good but definitely NOT fudgy!",
