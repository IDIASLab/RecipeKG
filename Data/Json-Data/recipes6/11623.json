But this year I decided to make it myself as something a little special for my husband. He loved it and so did my mom! (Others at the table didn't even try it as they just don't like cranberry sauce either!) I used half orange juice and half water and because so many reviewers commented that it was a little on the watery side I boiled it for 15 minutes to thicken it. What I found however was that once it cooled it really thickened so 15 minutes was a little too long. My guess is that boiling this for 10 minutes would be just right. This is a beautiful sauce jewel toned definitely fresh looking fresh tasting and delicious. Best of all my husband appreciated the extra effort. It was such a snap to put together I now wonder why I never made it until now. I will never buy canned again.",

It has thickened nicely in the fridge and it tastes divine. The perfect combination of sweet and then tart. I love the way the flavors explode on my tongue with the tart follwing the sweet.
