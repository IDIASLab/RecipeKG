Not wanting to have to go to the grocery store, I used 1/2 cup pureed, cooked sweet potato in place of the other banana. The cake came out FABULOUS, with a mere hint of banana taste, making this perfect for those who think they don't like banana cake. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, because it complements the flavor of banana anything. I used dark brown sugar, as well, since that was all I had.  In a 10-cup bundt pan, it took 50 minutes to bake completely. I glazed it with a cream cheese glaze (1 Tb softened butter, 4 oz softened cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 Tb milk.) It came out tremendously moist, and received rave reviews. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!",
