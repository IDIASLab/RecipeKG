Do your taste buds a favor and chop up some real garlic, instead of using garlic salt, by all means use real lemon juice, but you can use other herbs to season and avoid salt altogether and your blood pressure will thank you. Oh, and so the shrimp don't get lonely, give yourself a break and make up a box of Zatarain's Yellow Rice to serve with the shrimp. This is my favorite dish of all time. Fairly quick and easy.",
