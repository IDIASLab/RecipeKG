It didn't rise initially so I had to add a second yeast packet. Also the final results came out nothing like typical hamantashen. It puffed up so much so that it didn't hold its shape and it was pretty tasteless. Next time I will stick with a traditional cookie dough which appears in most recipes that I encountered. This was the only recipe which required yeast.",
