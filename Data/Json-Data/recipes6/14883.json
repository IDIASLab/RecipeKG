Instead of shortening I used half melted butter and half homemade organic applesauce. I used whole wheat white flour instead of AP flour. I had a feeling that this might need a little more liquid than it called for--I ended up adding an egg and a quarter cup buttermilk. These turned out quite well--though way too heavy on the cloves. I've made tomato soup cake before so it's a favorite of mine (and almost anyone else who knows me) and the smell of this recipe while baking? Wow! I really don't notice the tomatoey taste but again I've made tomato soup cake before. It's no different than any other spice cake really. It's just got a twang that really makes you say \"That's different!\" Great way to use up tomato soup! Just watch the amount of cloves you use. A sprinkle is plenty. NOTE: I got 12 muffins out of a half recipe. 350 for 20 minutes was the perfect baking time for me.",
