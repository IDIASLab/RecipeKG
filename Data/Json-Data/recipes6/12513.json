I cut the amount of brown sugar to 1 cup and the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I use half quick oats and half old fashioned oats.  And so I can get chocolate in tinier bits all over the cookies, I use mini baking M and Ms and the mini chocolate chips.  I tried it with chunky PB but found the smooth PB tasted a tad bit better.  \n\nI was fooled the first time and waited until they looked done before I took them out.  That meant they weren't as chewy so make sure to take them out right before they look done!    ",

One tip (I found this out from making cookies in the past) you must use the ice cream scoop or make them that big to have them turn out.  If you try to make them small, they will turn out very different.  The second time I made these, I ran out of creamy peanut butter so I used part crunchy.  I think I liked this mix - it added to the texture.  Yum!!",

Changes include: 1) substitue 3/4 c. of oats for flour. 2) Use half quick cooked oats and half regular rolled oats, so they're not so grainy/dry and stick together better. 3) I cut both brown sugar and white sugar by about 1/4 c. each (they're still almost too sweet) And 4) Substitue part of the chocolate chips and M&Ms with Butterscotch chips, so you put in an equal amount of each.  Definitely make these large or they will be very hard and flat. ENJOY!",

This is a special trick for ANY cookie which seems too hard.\nPlace cookies in an airtight container. ADD a slice of bread or 2 and cover. Wait to see what happens over night.

For some reason the cookies haven't been staying together recently.  Maybe they are making margarine with more water now or one of the ingredients have changed causing the recipe to not work.  I've been searching for another recipe similiar to the one I had.  This is it!  I followed the recipe perfectly and they are beautiful cookies!  They are NOT flat!  They are perfect size.  I bake 6 cookies at a time to give them enough room to evenly bake.  What a hit!  Thank you so much!",

I also added 1 tsp of salt, doubled the butter, and replaced 1/2 of the oats with flour and used quick cooking oats for the rest.  Using an ice cream scoop like the recipe said, I made 1/3 of the recipe and only ended up with 12 GIANT cookies.  These were a little fragile, even after setting for a few minutes to cool, but they turned out with a beautiful texture when they were completely cooled.
