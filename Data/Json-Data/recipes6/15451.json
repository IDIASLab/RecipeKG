And cooking rice? If you have enough tomato juice and baste you do not need to cook you rice, throw everything in at once and leave out the condensed stuff!!! tomato juice is much much better, and seriously nobody will notice the difference if you've sauted your onions!",

My brother said \"Ew the outside looks like brains. but the filling's good\". I also found the leaves need to be boiled in water instead to make sure they are moist not shriveled from the microwave and thoroughly cooked.
