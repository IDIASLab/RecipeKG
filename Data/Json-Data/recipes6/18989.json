(It's now my famous Pineapple Strawberry Banana bread - like the yogurt flavor)  Save the juice of the drained pineapple to make a glaze.  Glaze: 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 tablespoon pineapple juice.  Remove the bread from the pans and pour on top while it's still warm.  This adds tremendous flavor and keeps the bread SUPER moist.  If you want the glaze a little tangier, substitute w/ one tablespoon lemon juice.  If you want a sweeter bread, generously sprinkle light brown sugar on top b4 baking.  Fun, easy recipe that makes great dessert bread.  (Next time I'll make Strawberry Kiwi Bread)",

However I wanted to make it lower in fat and sugar and I like muffins better so I played with the recipe a bit. I tried using different sugar substitutes and found splenda to be the best. This is the new recipe with the adjustments I made: Strawberry-Pineapple-Banana Muffins. Preheat oven to 350. Grease two muffin tins or line with muffin papers. Use 10 ounces of frozen strawberries (slightly thawed and cut up small); 1/2 (20 ounce) can of crushed pineapple drained; 4 eggs beaten; 1 cup applesauce; 2 small well-ripened bananas; 1 1/3 cup splenda; 1/3 cup honey; 1/3 cup sugar; 3 cups whole wheat flour; 1 tsp. baking soda; 1 tsp. salt; 2 tsp cinnamon. I combined all the dry ingredients and all the wet ingredients then added the dry to the wet like the original recipe. Bake for 15-20 minutes. They are so moist and delicious!",

I use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup peanut oil and 1 stick of margarine in place of the oil called for. Otherwise I made this recipe exactly as called for and it turned out deliciously! I am a totally blind cook with chef aspirations so I love it when something like this comes along that is all but foolproof! And by the way the peanut oil seemed to give it a bit of a nuttier flavor that enhanced the pecans that I used since I was also out of walnuts. I'll be watching for more recipes like this to make and give as Christms gifts this year! Thanks so much to the contributor and all of you who wrote reviews. It was all very helpful to me!",
