It was quite a production to make however (dirtied lots of dishes took a long time) so it's not something I would take on very often. And I think I prefer the final flavor of my favorite jambalaya recipe over this one. But this recipe was fun to try - thanks for sharing. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for a few things. I cut up the andouille before cooking it which browned it all over and generated grease which I then used with just a little oil to cook the chicken. I only used one onion because 2 seemed like too much (although when all was said and done 2 probably would have worked fine.) I had to cook the rice a lot longer than the recipe calls for: about 5-7 extra minutes to absorb the liquid and 10 minutes or so extra for it to get tender. I also added about 1/2-3/4 cup of chicken broth for the last 10 minutes of cooking the rice because it seemed that there wasn't enough liquid to tenderize it. Finally I omitted the poblano chile because I didn't have one.",

The baking sheet is covered in foil so that doesn't even count. The rest of it I only used one pot and one bowl (to steam the peppers). I used Sweet Earth Mindful Chik'n, Beyond Meat sausage, Miyoko's cultured vegan butter, and chicken flavour broth (no meat or meat products at all in it). My partner wants me to encourage him to eat less meat so that's why I'm trying to make food that is familiar to him in a meat way but is vegetarian. Also, there was a LOT LESS grease because no real meat was used (actually no grease). :)\n\nOne thing I didn't like about this recipe is I think there was not enough liquid for the amount of rice called for. I added a bit more but next time will add even more. There wasn't even any sort of a sauce at the end and I do not want the leftovers to dry out. Not sure if it was because I was not using meat, maybe, who knows. \n\nI used FreshJax All Purpose Spicy along with the Cajun seasoning to give it a bit more kick but didn't make it painful hot. I crumbled the sausage rather than leaving it in the big pieces. (The Beyond products are really good for anyone who is interested. Just remember you're not cooking meat when you use them, so they don't need as long cooking times.) \n\nAlso I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so used tomato puree, it was just fine. \n\nAnd I added sauteed mushrooms to the veggies just because we love ",

                "reviewBody": "This was very good. I changed the method a bit because I misread the recipe and I used the optional hot pepper (serrano) instead of banana. I had everything prepped and the only variation planned was that my meat was pre-cooked. I totally missed that the rice is cooked IN this dish and thought my precooked rice was called for. So I added the meat seasoning and a teaspoon of chicken base to the sauteed vegetables and heated through. I then added the peppers corn tomatoes/sauce and beer and simmered to reduce some of the liquid (no broth-just the aforementioned base since the rice was cooked). I added the rice for the last couple of minutes to heat through. Fortunately I had enough to add the appropriate amount even with my mistake. With much of the prep already done this was a one pot dish and a little less involved so I would make it this way again. It's pretty spicy to the point that I would not make it for company but it was perfect for us.",

At the same time I sliced and sauted sausage links. Took it out of the pot and sauted 1 onion garlic and celery added salt and pepper and then added sliced boneless chicken thighs and let them cook.
