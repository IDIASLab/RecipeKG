Turned out that I didn't have the snow peas or brown sugar but it was light & tasty anyways. It was also very easy to make. Since I made in my toaster oven while my chicken baked I had to do it in two batches. For the second batch I just mixed the wet ingredients with the dry until I could pop them in to bake. I actually think that marinating the veggies in the liquid made it a little more flavorful. I will do this next time.",
