The night before, I pace the cherries in a seive over a bowl to drain throughly so they are dry (so that they don't bleed into the cake and make it pink.) I sometimes use more cherries then asked for as I love cherries. Keep the juice so that you can make a glaze with icing sugar & almond extract.  I spread about one-third on the bottom of a bundt pan ( Bundt pan sprinkled with red sugar)I then arrange one-third of the cherries evenly on the batter, then repeat with two more layers of batter followed by cherries; spreading evenly with spatula.  Bake for 60 minutes. Drizzle glaze over top. For an added touch, sift icing sugar over the top as well.  Yummy.Very presentable!",

This fit perfectly in one of the smaller, specialty Bundt pans and made a really beautiful presentation glazed with a mixture of reserved cherry juice and powdered sugar and just a light sprinkling of white jimmies. I found, however, that I had to bake it for a much shorter time, so I would suggest checking it after 50-55 minutes so as not to overbake--this may be the reason for the dryness some reviewers mentioned.

I also made the glaze as suggested in another review using the cherry juice and icing sugar, and more almond extract.  Everyone at work who tried it loved it!  This recipe will definitely be added to my annual Xmas baking!\n***Edit: I also tried this recipe using Splenda and it did not turn out well - the consistency of the dough was different, and it did not rise well at all, which affected the end product.  It came out very heavy and didn't have a very good texture.  I ended up throwing out almost all of it.  Next time I make it I'll definitely stick with the sugar!",

Dredging the cherries in the flour made them hold their color and shape, thus making nice, juicy, plump bites of cherry, and a cake that stayed a creamy white, and didn't bleed pink.  I did find, however, that it took less time to cook than stated in the recipe.  You might want to start checking for doneness sooner than the 80 minutes (mine took about an hour to cook).  I cubed this cake after cooling it and used it with a dessert fondue.  De-lish!!!!  Thanks for the yummy recipe, Holly! :)",
