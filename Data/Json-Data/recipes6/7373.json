I would skip this recipe if you're looking for something more authentic tasting, but as it is it's a very creamy, comforting dish. I didn't have the special Philly shredded cheese so I just used a regular bag of Mexican style cheese and added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese to the sauce mixture in the pan. Next time I'll probably add some cumin and cayenne to punch up the flavor a bit, and maybe use more salsa. Will make again.",

We will definitely make it again:) The only thing I did differently was shred my own cheese from bricks (mix of jack and cheddar) and I seasoned 3 chicken breasts with homemade fajita seasoning (though you could use store bought) pan seared them for 3 minutes per side put a tight fitting lid and removed from heat for 20 mins. I shredded the chicken in a bowl with 2 forks and poured the pan juices over top. I wiped the pan and used that for the onions and ultimately the mixture for the insides of the enchiladas. I also cut the tortillas down to 6. We have 2 adults and 2 kids in the family. This was enough for 2 full dinners. I served it with Cuban inspired black beans Vigo yellow rice and an ensalata garnish. Also I assumed tomatillo salsa and salsa verde were equivalent because I used Pace's salsa verde.",

This actually made enough to fill one 9x13 and one 8x8 glass baking dish. I used one thirty count package of corn tortillas.
