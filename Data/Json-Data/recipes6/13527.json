Because of this I made a promise to myself to one day get a hold of a recipe and make it myself because I just had to try Walnut Pie. We loved it!!!!! I however used Light Corn Syrup as I did not have the recipe with me at the grocery store and perhaps that gave it a not so sweet taste which we thought was perfect. Delicious Recipe soon to become a family favorite..",
