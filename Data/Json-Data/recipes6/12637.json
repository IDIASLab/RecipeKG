I have a suggestion however...mix your baking powder and salt with only 3 cups of the flour and add that first, then gradually add more flour until you have a proper dough consistency. I only needed 5 cups flour in total - not 7. The flavour of these cookies is outstanding! The dough rolls out nicely and it is so easy to cut out shapes and transfer to the cookie sheet. They have a wonderful texture once baked and cooled, and hold up beautifully while decorating. My intention was to cut out \"ghost\" shapes for Halloween, and then stick the sticks in some sort of foam graveyard I made, but I couldn't find proper cookie sticks in the time crunch I was in. I just cut out ghost and bat shapes and decorated with frosting and coloured sugars. Can't wait for Christmas now! LOVE this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing it!",

After I had them frosted I counted how many I needed and I had a few extra so I tasted one...they were very good ( I ate the whole thing). The cookie itself is not sweet at all but it is very tender. The frosting or icing makes them sweet. We will make these again. thanks for the idea!",

I have iced then with glace icing and they are lovely. Thanks for the great recipe. Just one thing I am British and have never heard of butter flavoured extract so I just left it out!

All ovens are different. Maybe try a little less flour. It's also easy to overwork your dough if you are rolling it in too much flour. Good luck on your next try!

I halfed the recipe due to a lack of enough butter in the fridge but it made MORE than enough cookies! lol Also I didn't have butter extract so I just did additional vanilla.
