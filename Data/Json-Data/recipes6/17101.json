I've NEVER thrown anything away but I couldn't figure out a way to tweak this recipe to improve the flavor so they all ended up in the \"recycle bin\". For those wanting to try this the flour/butter/sugar ratio doesn't seem to work (it's too dry and not sweet enough) and I feel 1/4 cup cocoa powder is a bit too much (it's too bitter) - maybe start with 2 tablespoons and add more as needed. Also as suggested by another reviewer 2 teaspoons of coffee is probably enough. Good luck.",

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the coffee part: instead of regular instant coffee I used 2 packets of Starbucks VIA vanilla flavored instant coffee. You can buy this in the grocery store or if not there in your local Starbucks. I had a couple of packets left over from making iced coffee this summer and decided to try them in this recipe. I mixed them directly into the wet ingredients. Have no fears...the coffee completely incorporates into the wet ingredients. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. The cookies were fabulous...rich dark chocolatey and delicious. Really good. One of my favorites! Try these but do try the vanilla flavored instant coffee...it makes a huge difference.",
