We opted out of using peppers swapped the Italian Seasoning for 1tbsp of Montreal Steak Spice and used some of the potato water in the stew. We also used one additional bouillon cube because we had a pack of 6 and needed to use two pots anyways. We felt like it could use a thickener like corn starch but didn't have any on hand. The final result was a bit more soupy than stew-like but still great. Will definitely have again and recommend to others.",
