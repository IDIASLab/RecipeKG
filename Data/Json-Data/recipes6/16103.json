I didn't want to use a whole 3/4 cup of melted butter so I cut the amount in half again and used more pumpkin. I cut the sugar back to a half cup for a HALVED recipe and I used half of a bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I had on hand instead of chocolate chip only because I was out. I was a little concerned about the muffin batter because it was so thick but these turned out beautifully. And the smell? Oh my goodness. The one issue I have is there isn't enough cinnamon. Next time I'll double the amount of cinnamon or use a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice. Texture wise these were wonderful and I didn't miss the sugar or butter that would have been in them had I not cut the amounts in half. NOTE: I always bake my muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. That was absolutely spot on baking temperature/time for these muffins.",

I ended up having about 80-90 mini-muffins. I took 50 to our Thanksgiving celebration and froze the rest. I should have taken them all -- they were gone within an hour!!
