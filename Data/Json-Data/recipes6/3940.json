So for that reason, I only used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. And for the 2 cups of milk, I did one cup milk, one cup half and half for a richer consistency and taste. It was delicious!! Next time I may cut my bread a bit thinner (maybe an inch and a half instead of 2 inches thick). And since all the yummy carmelized butter and sugar was on one side, I might try putting some of that mixture over the top too. But will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the recipe Tina!",
