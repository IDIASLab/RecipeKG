Because they're made with oil rather than shortening, butter or margarine the texture is different but every bit as good. Cookies made with shortening, margaine or butter tend to have crispy or crumbly edges, but when baked properly, these crisp up nicely on the edges also. For those with cholesterol, saturated fat or trnas-fats issues, this recipe is a great find. You are giving up nothing with these cookies. The flavor is excellent, and the texture very satisfying, and the batter freezes well.\r\nI would suggest making a batch but baking just one tray to see how they turn out in YOUR oven, because as we all know, the recipe numbers for temperature and length of baking time vary with our own particular oven. Mine was spot-on, but cookies baked on the lower rack burned a little while upper rack cookies were perfection. I add walnuts, but I assume you can add anything you want, craisins, raisins, coconut, any kind of nut. You can even leave out the chocolate. But who'd be crazy enough to do that?",

                "reviewBody": "Many thoughts about this recipe, which is pretty good.  Almost certainly the people who disliked these cookies used old, rancid oil to make it.  You must use reasonably fresh oil.  To improve the flavor, if you have it, you can use a few tablespoons of sesame, almond, walnut, coconut or other nut oils.  If you only shop at the grocery store, your best choices are probably corn or peanut oil, although any will work.  You could also add one or two Tbsps of melted butter to add a bit of butter flavor without all the saturated fat.  Moreover, the fat in this recipe can be reduced a bit without affecting the texture much.  Since this is basically a Toll House Cookie recipe that uses oil instead of butter, and butter is 20% water and milk solids by volume, you can reduce the amount of fat by 20%, replacing it with milk or water, and still get a good result.  So use 3/4 cup (12-13 Tbsps) of oil, and about 3-4 Tbsps liquid.  If you use the fat + water, make the recipe with bread flour, and mix the dough awhile after the flour is added (say a minute), you will have a chewy textured cookie.  Whole-wheat flour and some added spices (about 2 tsp mixed) makes a good spice cookie.  Adding 2 tsp corn syrup to the recipe (you can use pancake syrup) will help the cookies stay moist and soft.",

I like that it is made with oil instead of shortening (which many other recipes call for) because oil is something that is commonly used in my house. I wouldn't know what else to use the shortening for. The flavor for these cookies usually come out very well. I have occasionally had trouble with the chips falling out of the dough, but that happens very rarely. Either way, I've used this recipe at least 15 times now, and I am usually very satisfied with these. They're soft and chewy, and not dry at all.",

Then one time I did not have enough veggie oil so I supplemented with corn oil (about half and half). The cookies turned out even better with this mixture. The corn oil seemed to add an additional level of richness that the cookie didn't have previously. I highly recommend trying a combo of these two oils. I've thought about using all corn oil but I'm happy with how they are turning out now and don't want to risk it. I also bake on convection bake at 325 and for about 11 minutes. I'm sure the temp and cooking time will just vary from oven to oven.",

I use a tad more brown sugar because I like my cookies with that extra hint of brown sugar and I use smart oil which is a mixture of vegetable oil and olive oil. I also cut out the almond extract. This is perhaps the easiest cookie I have ever made and delicious wither fresh from the oven or chilled in the fridge.",
