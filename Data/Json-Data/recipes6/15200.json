Here's what I recommend. 1) Taste your strawberries first to determine how sweet they are. This will help you decide how much sugar to use. 2) As suggested by a previous reviewer, discard the excess sugar, flour and cornstarch mixture to prevent your pie from becoming goopy and soupy. 3) Make a brown sugar oatmeal crumble topping for your pie by combining one stick of butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup oatmeal, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a pinch of salt. The topping will be beautiful and brown.",

Also, a tip if you have extra flour, sugar and cornstarch that does not mix in completely with the strawberries throw it out and do not add it to the pie.  I made that mistake and it all sunk to the bottom of the pie so there was a thick layer of white gooey liquid at the bottom. Other than that it was a quick and delicious pie!",

A half cup of flour and a tablespoon of cornstarch is waaaaay too much thickener for four cups of ANY kind of fruit and I should have followed my gut and trusted my 50 years of baking experience.  I even used five cups of berries and it still was a pasty, raw floury, unappetizing goo.  (This literally WAS inedible - I'm not exaggerating merely to stress a point) It was a beautiful pie, I'll give it that, because the crust was great (Harden Your Arteries Pie Crust) and the topping was beautiful and delicious. But the disaster is obvious immediately upon cutting into it. Had this recipe called for half the amount of thickener I might have ended up with a decent pie, but the recipe is what it is and, if prepared as is with the error in the ingredients, is simply awful and a failure. (For those of you who are interested, I have posted a personal photo of the cut slice which is worth a thousand words)",

If you want it less sweet, make sure you cut on the sugar in the crumb topping, because that's what's overly sweet. Also, the pie was white/yellow and rough (I could taste the granular sugar even though I sifted it), so definitely use brown sugar (sifted) for a better texture. Overall, if it weren't for the filling, this would've tasted like chunks of white sugar.",
