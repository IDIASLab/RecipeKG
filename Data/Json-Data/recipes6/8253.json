This batch was good but I  was disappointed because it wasn't as good as the first batch.

Followed the directions to the letter, and then made a few adjustments (personal preference here).  I wanted a thicker, creamier consistency, so I did add additional flour (Wondra\u00ae) mixed with more sherry (love sherry in mushroom soup).  Next time, I\u2019ll use baby bella/cremini mushrooms for a bit bolder flavor, but this was not the least bit shabby made with less expensive white mushrooms.  Smooth, creamy, with a delicate flavor, and the thyme was the perfect herb for this soup.  So very, very easy.  This soup is good enough to serve to guests.  I\u2019m always on the lookout for Instant Pot\u00ae recipes, and this is a good one\u2026SAVED!!",

Eliminated the sherry and replaced with 1/2-1 teaspoon of good quality balsamic vinegar (be very careful as you can over do it, taste test it as you go). Also added to taste liquid aminos, a full bunch of thyme tied into a bouquet garnis, and two full cups of heavy cream. I pur\u00e9ed the soup in a BlendTec blender then poured back into my Instant Pot to thicken slightly, although it didn\u2019t really need it. I served with crusty toasted buttered San Francisco sourdough slices from Arizmendi Bakery in the famous Mission District. Thank you for this recipe it\u2019s so good I would serve this for a very high end dinner or a casual meal at home. It\u2019s 5 star restaurant quality.",
