A few tips: don't flatten when you put the pecan on top they spread and if your kitchen is warm put the formed cookies on the sheet in the frige for a few minutes so they won't spread too much. A great recipe I will use over and over and over again.",

I can say I'm really glad that I did. These are tender buttery tasty and attractive! I didn't change the recipe at all. You should make sure your butter is soft (use the real thing) but I don't recommend putting it in your microwave. I used a small cookie scoop to keep the size uniform which I think is also important. Mix the dough thoroughly. I had some butter on the top of the mixing bowl that I incorporated into a couple of cookies and these really spread out! Otherwise the other cookies were fine and maintained their shape. Mine took 12 minutes exactly at 350\u00ba and when done I let them cool on the cookie sheet about 10 minutes before removing them to a wire cooling rack. The maple flavor is very delicate so if you want a heavier maple taste you may want to make a thin maple glaze for garnish once the cookies are completely cool. My husband loved them just the way they were and I will be making these again for sure. Thanks Denise for this wonderful recipe!",

I actually thought the opposite and thought for the amount of sugar they tasted rather sugary and a little crunchy. For some reason I was thinking they would be like shortbread but not at all. I did not have any pecans and wanted the maple flavor to stand out. I used a modified version of a maple icing from another cookie recipe on the site. I made 1/2 recipe and got 18 cookies with a cookie scoop. My favorite part of the cookie was the icing but I am actually reviewing the cookie. Based on the picture I was surprised that these cookies spread quite a bit to so make sure to leave them in a mound. They also get even more crispy as they cool which I didn't care for but that could possibly help with that. I wish these would have worked for Christmas. I put them out but they didn't get eaten like the others. It could have been because they were so flat but for me it was the texture and sugary taste of the cookie.",
