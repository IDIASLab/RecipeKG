I tried this one (with a little modification) and it turned out great. The thing to remember is that the boiling water already cooks the cornmeal, so you don't have to fry it that long - just long enough for it to get LIGHT brown on each side. If you add sugar, you'll need to watch it extra carefully because the sugar will cause the cornbread to burn if the heat is real high. I'm not a pro and can prepare this without measuring!",

I also altered the recipe a little by taking the salt out completely and doubling the sugar. This give the bread a sweeter taste. I found it to be too salty with the original for my own taste.",

Next time I'll try 3/4 teaspoon salt.\r\n\r\nI couldn't form little flatten balls, so I just dropped the batter by heaping spoonfuls onto a well-oiled skillet (I found that an eighth inch of oil worked as well as a half inch)\r\n\r\nThey cook quickly and also burn quickly, so keep a close eye on the frying process.",

I modified this to omit the sugar and shortening and cooked in olive oil.  I dipped it in honey and it was very delicious - my whole family loved it!  I agree with other reviewer that there is no difference with or without shortening so you might as well save the fat (I did try both ways).  I also tried cooking the cornbread in 1/2\" canola oil the first time and 1/8\" olive the second time I made it and it tasted the same so again you can save calories. I will use this recipe over and over again - thanks!",
