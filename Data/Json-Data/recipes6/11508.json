Butter divided into 2 Tbls. separately into 2 small bowls of 1/2 Cup packed Brown Sugar w/1 Tbls. Pineapple Juice in ea. small bowl. Mixed each well then placed sliced Pineapple 1/2 circles onto mixture in each pan. (Used 1 and 1/2 cans 15 oz. each Sliced Pineapple) (2) I used \"Duncan Hines Moiste Deluxe BUTTER Golden Recipe\" cake mix in which I used 2/3 Cup Pineapple Juice instead of water 3 Eggs 1 Stick Real BUTTER softened; beat 4 minutes at 150 strokes per minute; poured 1/2 of batter into the 2 9\" pans over the Pineapple/Sugar mixture. (3) Baked 350 oven 20 min. Cooled 15 min. Turned out perfect even though I did not have cherries on hand. This was prepared to serve guests and it was a hit. Far better tasting cake than found in stores or bakery shops! Submitted Oct. 7 2010",
