I told him had I known that I wouldn t have made the cake. He enthusiastically said he d take it on the plane with him to his meeting! Nah I said. It s just a cake mix. I don t want you to give that to them. So Hubs isn t here and I tried that cake. I cut a slice intending to just try a bite but I ended up finishing it off. In other words I needn t have been concerned about it being good enough. He should have taken it to the meeting and everyone would have enjoyed it. I did have to put this cake together with things I had on hand or wanted to make use of. I used the butter pecan cake mix but since I had no toffee bits I substituted miniature chocolate chips. I only had one banana but a half cup of applesauce worked like a charm for that second banana. I used buttermilk rather than water and in deference to Hubs sensitive innards I omitted the pecans from the batter sprinkling them on top of the cake instead. The cake is moist and flavorful - and incredibly no cake mix taste! Since I had already introduced chocolate into the cake I glazed it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze also from this site. I am so pleased with this cake and have no doubt it would be perfect as is without my modifications. My only criticism is with the baking time I found it took closer to 50 minutes to bake thoroughly.",
