I can pop one in the microwave for 20 seconds or so and run out the door with it! I added organic flax seed to mine so they were a bit more dense but it gave them a really nice texture as well. They're nice with butter and easy to feed to small children. Certainly worth a try. I think this recipe has great potential for personalizing with your favorites grains or even nuts etc.",

The problem as it were is that the batter is delicious but just tastes like dough and the bacon and corn pieces are few and far between.
