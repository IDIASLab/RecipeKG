But its a lot cheaper than the other stuff:) Skipped the sugar since the lemonade added enough sweetness to it. Kids loved it. I think they were mostly happy that they don't have to wait for a trip to the store where I'm willing to fork over the for a drink:) Great way to use up your leftover tea and lemonade as well!
