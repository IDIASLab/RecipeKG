When he called me in the afternoon he said and I quote \" I went in the lunchroom to get the pan and caught a guy licking it\" Gross but you get the point! Apparently it was a huge hit and not a morsel was left. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I had to make alterations suggested by a few other members in order to get the recipe to work. 1. I melted the chocolate chips 2. I added approximately 7 minutes to the cooking time as it was undercooked after the suggested time. Thank you for the great recipe!!",

I also use an oreo crust (about half a bag of oreos and 3/4 stick of melted butter)- hey.. if your gonna go chocolate... go all the way!  I omit the chocolate chips (to keep the smooth velvety texture) and add 1/4 C expresso to make a \"chocolate cappachino\" cheesecake.  Personally, I think it tastes better than that choc capp. cheesecake recipe on here and WAY easier!!  I dont use the sour cream topping because the cheesecake has such a beautiful chocolatly color by itself...  Thank you for the recipe!",

I replaced one of the packages of cream cheese with Neufch\u00e2tel cheese. Instead of butter I used Smart Balance Blend. I also used low fat graham crackers. To ensure consistency I used an extra egg yolk. The sour cream was reduced fat. Like many others in the reviews I melted the chocolate chips. This was by far the tastiest cheesecake I ve made in awhile. It was also the simplest. I was a little worried that it wouldn t be set in the allotted time but I was worried for nothing. The second really made helped bring together the flavors in the topping. I m not big on toping cheesecakes with sour cream but this worked. I will say that I d be fine with no topping at all because the cheesecake doesn t really need it. The crust was just right the consistency of the cheesecake was perfect and the taste was spot on. There are no leftovers. If you are hesitating about which recipe to try- go for this one. Its easy and its delicious. What more can you ask for?",

When you say chocolate lover's you really mean it! I wanted a chocolate cheesecake. This was more like a chocolate pie. There was cream cheese of course but it was overpowered by the chocolate. I don't think that I will make this one again. But if you're truly a chocolate lover this is your cake.",
