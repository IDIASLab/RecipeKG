The peel won't be bitter if you zest it correctly taking only the top layer not the white pithy underside close to the lemon. It's that white pith that makes for the bitter taste. Use a lemon zester or one of those graters that look like a carpenter's rasp to get just the zest. A light touch to grate is all it takes. This is great on spinach salads.",
