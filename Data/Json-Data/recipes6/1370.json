This recipe definitely needs more seasoning than listed.\n2- Added onions cut in 1/2 in strips.  I didn't want to add raw veggies straight to the oven, so I stir fried the onions and peppers (1/2 in cubes) until the onions were translucent with olive oil, salt, pepper, and two whole cloves of garlic (smashed to release flavor)\n3- Used 2.5 cups of tomato sauce and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Seasoned with salt, pepper, parsley, and oregano.  I simmered the sauce in a med. pot for 5-10 minutes to allow the seasoning to cook in.  Then I heated my ground beef in the sauce (I brown and freeze ground beef in bulk).\n4- Only cooked in the oven for about 20-25 minutes.\n\nThis was such a good recipe.  It reminded my roommates and I of home.  Definitely a soul-food recipe.  :)",

Then added tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, fresh basil, bay leaves, oregano & only used 2 tbs. white sugar.  Reduced the rice to 1cup & added a little shredded cheese to the beef mixture.  Precooked chunky sliced green peppers (only used green) in 3 tbs. water in bottom of baking dish.  Poured meat mixture over peppers & sprinkle more shredded cheese over top.  My husband said it was great & wanted me to keep this recipe in favorites.....Easier than making stuffed peppers & my sister didn't precook the peppers & loved it that way too.",
