The batch made 20 muffins and they were wonderful warm out of the oven with a little bit of butter. It was almost like southern peach cobbler but remember I used 2 heaping cups of peaches. It really isn't too sweet so keeping that in mind you might consider adjusting the sugar a little if you like a sweet muffin but I liked the sweet bites each time I found a peach bit so it didn't bother me. It is not your standard fluffy muffin recipe and it seems to be on the heavier side. But I found it refreshingly different which is why I came to the site. I think I am going to try it again in a couple of months with APPLES! This is a great comfort food recipe and my roommate ate 4 in a row right out of the oven and raved about them.",
