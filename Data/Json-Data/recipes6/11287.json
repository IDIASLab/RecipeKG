I didn't put the pecans in the icing, I just chopped them up pretty small and put them on the sides of the cake and on the center of the cake (a filled in circle) with some coconut around it in a circle.  it looked goregeous!  i don't know if anyone else knows this already, but i made it the night before, and stored it in the fridge.  don't do that.  if you just leave it on a cake platter with a dome over it, it stays moist and soft and light.  in the fridge, it's still divine, just thicker, heavier, and less moist.\nETA:  I made this as a 4 tiered wedding cake and it was beautiful!  I swirled the frosting and made a ribbon border with chopped pecans on each tier.  It was devoured by all who came.  The bride and groom said that when they ate their top tier a year later (after being frozen for a whole year) it tasted like I had just made it that same day!",

After tasting it, another co-worker ordered one for her mother-in-law's b-day. I have never sold a cake to anyone, but she insisted and gave me 25.00. Her mother-in-law said it made her year, and she gave me 10 more!!! I don't know what cakes sell for, but I was blessed and tickled.  I am not sure whose tips I read and followed, but it really made the cake wonderful and I will share them but not take the credit.....1. Make sure the eggs are room temperature (peak easier). 2. Use 5 yolks instead of 4. 3. DOUBLE the frosting and consider using half butter and half shortening. 5. Use parchment paper. 6. Make the cake the night before (or earlier in the day) let cool completely and cover but do not refrigerate.  My tweaks...1. Use half vanilla and half imitation rum flavoring in the frosting. 2. Keep cake in the refrigerator to maintain fresh flavor. 3. Do not use pecan \"chips\", there are too many shells.",

I used Pam's flour cooking spray and had no problems with the layers coming out of the pans or breaking apart. I did have to double the frosting to have enough to put on the whole cake. The only thing that I would change next time is to use less coconut but that is just for my own personal taste.",

I've also made it with almonds instead of pecans and now I plan to make a chocolate version. Anyone who isn't successful with this cake obviously doesn't know the first thing about baking.

I have used it for cupcakes 9 x 13 single layer 9-inch layers and 5-inch towers. The ONLY thing I change...I do not mix the pecans into the icing because it shreds the tender crumb of the sponge cake......I just sprinkle the pecans around the lower half of the sides and the top of the cake.",

It fell apart did not rise very well and when I tasted it I did not taste the yummy moist cake I have read about. I followed the directions to the T and use high quality ingredients and bakeware and have never had to throw out a cake until I made this one.",
