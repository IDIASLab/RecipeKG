I bought the store brand the quality of the chocolate was not good and unfortunately that on its own took away the WOW factor when you bite into the cookie! The cookie dough softens pretty quickly so put it back in the fridge between batches. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and sprinkled some sea salt on the cookie balls before heading into the oven. We typically don't like things too sweet these days so I think that little bit of salt worked better for us than the additional sugar would have. Pretty good would have been better had I used higher-quality chocolate candy.",
