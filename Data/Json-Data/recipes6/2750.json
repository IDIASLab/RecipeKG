I followed the directions exactly except instead of putting the batter all in one pan I made 4 small loaves. Probably took about 40 minutes to bake. For my 2 c dried fruit I used a combination of currants raisins and dried cranberries. Best served thickly slathered with butter and a cup of tea. Mmm Mm good. Suggestion: really grease well the bottom of the pan. Barmbrack is an old Irish recipe usually made with yeast as the rising agent but I like this version because it's so quick to put together.",
