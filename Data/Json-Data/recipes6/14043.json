You're in for a real sweet treat!  Dump this jar into the biggest bowl ya got and mix it around real good.   Add a stick of melted butter and whipped up egg.  (A teaspoon of vanilla if you got some in the chuck wagon.)  Mix with your five cleanest fingers till it looks like cookie dough ought to.  Bake for 11-13 minutes.

I changed the arrangement of the ingredients putting the flour on bottom then the oatmeal brown sugar white sugar nuts (I used walnuts) and chocolate chips. This kept the flour from spilling into the nuts and chocolate chips. I was unable to use all of the chocolate chips but the cookies still turned out delicious. I used a small spice jar to press all of the layers into the jar. Several mentioned the cookies getting hard. If you will put a half slice of white bread (wheat may work I've just never tried it) in the container with the cookies and put a lid on them they will stay soft. The bread gets hard but the cookies stay soft...very weird. Anyway I tied little inexpensive ornaments and ribbon around them and printed the instructions on decorative labels and put on the jars. TOO CUTE!!! These will make great gifts!!",

Everyone who receives them as a gift begs to get them again next year :-)  One change I would make is to switch around the order they tell you to package the ingredients.  Layer the chunky items (like chips and nuts) on top of the flour/sugar etc.  Otherwise they end up covered up by settling flour and sugar.  Use a widemouth jar, and make sure you pack the ingredients TIGHT, otherwise it won't all fit.  These cookies are fabulous in every sense of the word!!!",

Everything fit perfectly and the cookie did not lack for chips. I also bought (for 1) a weighted-bottom cylindrical bud vase to tamp down the ingredients as I placed them in the jar. It worked great. I just have to remember not to get in a hurry with my tamping so I won't knock the glass 'tool' up against the glass jar which might cause it to break. To decorate the jar I spray painted the lid and the rim blue. I bought some fabric that looked very cowboyish (red with guitars hats boots etc.) and cut it into triangular kerchefs and tied it around the neck of the jar. I used card stock to make postcard sized tags which I put the instructions on as well as a picture of horses from my cardshop software on the other side. I punched a hole in the corner and tied it to the jar with jute (I put this on first and then the kerchef.)",

As other reviews stated I found it a little tough to fit all ingredients into the jar so what I did was place 1/2 cup chocolate chips in midway (where the recipe says) and fit 1/2 cup (or as much as I could) at the very top. The chips are much simpler to scrunch down than flour! Also I echo the sentiment regarding low-fat margarine. Although I use it for nearly all of my cooking I found that when I used it with these cookies they were a bit crunchier and drier than I'd prefer.",
