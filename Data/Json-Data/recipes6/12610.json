Made half the recipe but should have made the whole thing! Added a little cinnamon and 2 Tb honey-crunch wheat germ. Used Mini M&M's and quick oats. Baked on nonstick cookie sheet (ungreased). Best to let them cool a minute on pan before removing to rack until they firm up a little. The M&M's made them look so pretty. I will be making these often even at Christmas! Yum.",

No need to grease the pan if you're using aluminum foil. Just let them set up for about 5 minutes and they come right off! So good:)",
