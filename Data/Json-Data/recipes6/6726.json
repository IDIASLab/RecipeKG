Even though I'm a huge fan of wonton soup, it was my first time making it. They definitely get easier to make after you get the hang of it. Next time I might add a touch of sesame oil and rice wine vinegar to the meat mixture. You could even get away with another carton of chicken broth because this makes a ton of wontons, unlike when you order it from a restaurant and it's mostly broth. Thanks for the recipe!",
