I made a batch using plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked fabulously. When the muffins were gone I used this recipe for banana bread replacing the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. It works you just have to let it bake a little longer to get done in the middle. I also found that these are great with even less sugar (thought they don't have much to begin with) the ripe bananas do plenty of sweetening.",

                "reviewBody": "My best advice about this recipe is to bake it just before you go to bed at night. That way you can leave them to cool overnight and when you get up in the morning you can stick them into the freezer (before tasting them) so you can have some left for tomorrow. Just keep 2 or 3 out or as many out as you need for breakfast or brunch. That is unless you need them all that day for some occasion or just to be immediately eaten because they will be if there's anyone around to sample or taste them. They baked up beautifully - very light and fluffy but needed to cook a little longer than 20 mins to come out of the papers easily. I baked these for a study group next week but I know I'm going to have trouble having some left by then even though they're in the freezer. What I like most about this recipe is that it uses only 1/2 cup of sugar. We all know that bananas have the highest sugar content of any fruit and therefore don't need 3/4 or 1 1/2 cups of sugar with them. They are deliciously and perfectly sweet with this small amount of sugar. I toyed with adding some spices (just because I like spiced bananas) but decided to do it as written first to see how they taste normally. They are quite scrumptious as is and I'm really thankful that I found this recipe. It's perfect!",

To the reviewer who used 1/4C extra banana rather than sour cream and got poor results: baking soda requires an acidic ingredient to cause it to act. By removing the sour cream and replacing it with fruit you removed that acidic ingredient and the baking soda remained inactive.",

Other than that everything was kept the same.....cooked in about 22 minutes.....i really beat together the egg and banana mixture so i think that helped make the muffins so spongey....mmmmm!!!! Just the right amount of sweetness o-so-low in fat and just straight up scrumptious!!!!! Made exactly 12. seriously- try this recipe!!!",

Going by the reviews & personal preferece I made a few minor changes: Instead of 1 cup ap flour I used 1/2 cup all purpose & 1/2 cup whole wheat. I also changed the 1/4 cup sugar to a mix of sugar/Splenda. I used 3 ripe bananas (what I had on hand) instead of measuring out the one cup & added a dash of cinnamon & Splenda to the top of each muffin before baking. 20 minutes worked perfect in my oven. Yum! Don't let the scant 1 cup of flour fool you - you will get 12 regular sized muffins or 6-8 generously large muffins out of this small amount of batter. I didn't taste any of the bitterness or have any problems with dryness. Perhaps the extra bit of banana made a difference? I don't know for certain but when I made my second batch I stuck with my changes & they came out great too.",

They were moist, but that's all that I could say that was good about them.  I almost trashed them, but I know people who'll eat anything. I did tear up the recipe sheet and throw that away. The simple ingredients drew me to this one, but I think muffins really need butter/margarine. Thanks but I'll keep on looking.",
