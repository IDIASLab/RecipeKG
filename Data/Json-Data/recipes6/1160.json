I like it the way it is (the original recipe) but the chips/nuts additions can be modified with different flavored chips, Heath bar bits, M&M chips etc... The dough kind of reminds me of chocolate chip cookie dough, only just plop it in the pan and go! Great recipe, and I could see a young cook being able to do these easily! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",
