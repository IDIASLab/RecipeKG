The Smithfield portobello pork loin was excellent and not overly salty like others I've had in the past. The hot sauce was a must in my opinion or else it would have been a little bland. This was super simple and quick and the possibilities for the loins are endless.",

Happily I think the slices may easily be re-purposed into sandwiches with the addition of some barbecue sauce and/or other condiments. Now to the problems with the combination. Frozen baby corn is not part of the line-up at any of the grocers in town so I had to use the canned product as well which I often omit from Asian recipes. Other than the visual aspect it did not add to the overall flavor profile. I used an orange bell pepper instead of red because that is what I had on hand. I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the vegetables to keep the minced garlic from burning and I wish I had added more along with some additional seasoning. But that's the problem. Is this an Asian dish with okra and thyme added or is this a Southern dish with baby corn added? What seasoning to add? For me I think this should go all out Asian with the usual associated flavors of soy sauce ginger sesame oil and maybe some sherry for a bit of sweetness.",
