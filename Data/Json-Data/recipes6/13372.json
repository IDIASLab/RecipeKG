I baked it 45 min. on bottom rack as per recipe but it was like water when I took it out. I've never made a pie like this so I'm hoping someone who gave this 5 stars will review it and tell me what I did wrong. Needless to say I was very embarrassed when I cut into a beautifully done pie (or so it appeared) only to have it liquid in the middle. Help please!",

I've seen this happen to me with other recipes mostly cakes. If you try it again just stir to combine the ingredients once you cream the sugar and butter and corn syrup. See if this might help. Good Luck!",
