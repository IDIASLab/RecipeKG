I also added in quite a bit more matzo meal to get the right consistency and omitted most of the water. everyone enjoyed it tremendously.",

However there were a couple of problems with this recipe and I would not make it again for the following reasons: 1) very very bland. It tastes just barely decent with a good dose of horseradish but it needed more salt and/or flavor. Next time I would try some marjoram or cinnamon even if that departs with tradition. 2) far more problematic the amounts are WAY off unless by '8 servings' they meant '32 pieces of gefilte fish.' I bought appr. 4 pounds of ground fish and it made about 40 servings. Certainly not 8. I would have made only half the recipe had I known!",
