Kinda hard to rate this recipe now because my original thought was that these were just way too spicy but clearly they wouldn't have been if I would have used a cup and a half of maple syrup. Problem is there that I think they would have been too sweet for my liking if I wouldn't have overlooked that step. I'm going with a 4 and all I can say on that note is use your judgement on the hot sauce syrup ratio. We enjoyed the rub that went on these prior to frying and I will make again.",
