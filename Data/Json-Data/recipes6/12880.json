It was the very cookie I had been looking for. It's sturdy enough did not spread and the vanilla I used came thru wonderfully. The Lollipops look beautiful and will be used for my daughter's tea party. Made again 12/21/06- This is truly a no fail recipe. I would refer to this more as a cut out cookie. It's super sturdy. Made them for my daughters cookie decorating party. This is by far the easiest cookie I have ever made. If your making them as simply just a butter cookie I suggest using chocolate jam confectioner sugar or sprinkles to enhance the cookie. Or even bake them with that coarse sugar.4/17/08 What can I say used the recipe again! This is the most reliable recipe I have. I used it this time as a cheesecake crust. I wanted to make something easy and will bring them to my daughters class today. Ro thank you so much for sharing. Anyone who gave this recipe a bad rating must have done something wrong.",
