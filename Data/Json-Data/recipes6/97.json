I did use yellow cake from scratch as I am not too fond of mixes. My partner who loves all things pineapple banana coconut and macadamia nut was in heaven. Luckily I had the brilliant idea of baking this up in two pans so that he could take one to work with him as we would never be able to eat it all ourselves. Apparently it disappeared during the morning coffee break. I will likely be making this again.",

I've never tried this recipe before so I didn't want to stray too much but I did buy a \"fresh\" pineapple and coconut (we live in Kentucky how fresh could they be?). Anyway it worked pretty well but was way too sweet. I would still use \"fresh\" coconut and pineapple but leave out 1/3 - 1/2 the brown sugar and substitute more of the \"fresh coconut milk for the pineapple juice. BTW we couldn't taste much bannana so add 2-3 instead of 1.",

I used a 9 inch round cake pan and cooked for 40 mins. We didn t have leftovers. Thanks for posting. That being said I have a few extra comments: The ingredients list said white cake but the narrative said yellow (I used white). Also note that the cake mix size said 18.25 oz but that was slightly larger than the boxes at my market. Finally I would have liked the author to specific sweetened or unsweetened coconut as it is an ingredient I don t use a lot and questioned it. Given it didn t specifically say sweetened I assumed un-sweetened which I couldn t find it at my local market and too lazy to go to a second store so I used sweetened coconut. The cake was sweet but not overly sweet as the other reviewer thought. Finally I personally didn t prefer the taste of the banana in the recipe but after my family was done they said they didn t notice.",
