This was a refreshing break. As this was baking I already decided it was worth it for the aroma alone - SO fragrant of fresh orange.  It must have been a combination of the recipe itself, my adding two tablespoons of vegetable oil to ensure a moist cake, and cutting back on the baking time by several minutes that I did not experience the dryness other reviewers reported. This cake is soft, with a dense but tender crumb, very light, buttery (I did use butter rather than the margarine called for)  and prominently, pleasantly orange. The term \"glaze\" in the recipe is misleading, as this is really not a glaze at all.  It's actually a flavored simple syrup that soaks into the cake, infusing it with added moisture and flavor and should not be skipped or altered. A delightful change from heavily spiced, heavily frosted or overly sweet treats.  Delicious, satisfying and very pretty too.  Whether or not the the cake would turn out as good and moist without the 2 T. of oil I added, I'm not sure - what I do know is that if you add it, you won't be sorry. And be careful not to overbake!",

She was improvising on another loaf recipe, though, and most often the loaves would fall, although they tasted great!  I took her recipe, and came on-line.  Lo and behold if this orange loaf isn't EXACTLY the same as mom's, except for a bit of extra flour, which is all that was needed to keep it nice and rounded on the top.  I emailed mom with the recipe, which she used this year.  Thanks for helping improve on one of my favourite Christmas traditions!  As for the glaze, Mom's loaf only called for half of this one, and I thought the amounts listed here would make way too much.  I made 2 loaves at once---one with only half the glaze(like mom's), and one as this recipe calls for.  I liked this one the best.  It made the loaf nice and moist.  Just be sure to let the loaf sit as required to let the glaze soak in.  Thanks again-- this is a great loaf, and I've made 8 of them to give away in the last \r\nmonth, following in my mother's footsteps.",

I followed the recipe exactly and it made so much that I think it calls for reducing the \"sugared juice\" in the pan to thicken it into a glaze. Otherwise it was very good!\nUpdate: Made it again and this time simmered the glaze until it redused to about half and then removed the bread from pan and brushed it on. Came out much better! 5 Stars! On a side note, I accidently added only 1/2 cup sugar to the bread and it still came out delightful! Great way to cut back!",

Besides, I have added an extra of 2T olive oil, as suggested by another reviewer, which made the loaf moistened beautifully. For the \"glaze\", it really helps to bring an additional orange flavor and helps lighten up the surface of the loaf. Great idea for the glaze!! This recipe will be used in the rest of my life, for SURE :)",

I added 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract to the batter along with the rind and orange juice. The loaves would be pretty dry without the glaze so I wouldn't recommend skipping it. I thought that 1/4 cup sugar wasn't enough to make a syrupy glaze so I increased it to 1/2. I also added the juice from 1/2 a lemon which made the glaze more tart and citrusy. I didn't use all of it on the loaves because I was afraid to make them too soggy but I think I probably could have used it all without a problem.",
