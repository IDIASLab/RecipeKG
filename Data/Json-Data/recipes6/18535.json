Cake flour is the only way to go to get the light, fluffy chiffon.  All-purpose flour creates a denser and sometimes fallen cake.  Use frozen guava juice concentrate (or passion fruit) in batter for a stronger flavor.  1 c. of egg whites is enough (6 jumbo/7 large eggs), just beat them until very stiff to hold volume.  If not beaten long enough, you\u2019ll have baked guava pudding.  For guava topping, the ideal recipe is 1 c. concentrate thickened on stove with previously mixed 1 T. corn starch and 2 T. water.  I only had guava pulp (Goya brand) available and made my own concentrate:  2 c. guava pulp with 1/4 c. sugar to reduced to 1 c.  I thickened with the corn starch/water mixture.*  When desperate, thin some guava jam with water, and it works fine!\n*Using the reduced pulp in the cake makes for a flavorful though denser cake, more like guava bread.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you want a real chiffon.\n",

I decided to try and duplicate the way the cake is served from this well known Hawaiian Bakery in LA.  I began by  making a filling combining 2 cups guava nectar and 1/4 cup sugar.  Bring to a boil and remove from heat.  Blend in 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with a small amount of water.  Let cool.  Frost each layer with whipped cream and some guava filling.  You can then frost the entire cake with whipped cream.  For color, you can also spread some of the filling on the top of the cake.  Chill before serving.  Not exactly the same as the Hawaiian bakery, but close enough to satisfy my tastebuds.",

Perhaps it would have been better using cake flour. The taste was okay but you can achieve similar taste with less work by doctoring a white cake mix with guava nectar juice. Excellent topped with guava glaze. I found other recipes online. (Side note- an actual picture of the cake would be appreciated instead of what I'm guessing is a stock photo since that I've seen this same pic posted on several other websites)",
