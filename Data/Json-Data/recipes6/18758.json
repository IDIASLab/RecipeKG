The reviewer who said to be careful not to boil higher than 242 is right as they'll get too firm. I've made this recipe dozens of times and these are delicious! It is time consuming but so worth it. You can come very close to Lamme's pralines if you use mostly dark Karo and brown sugar. I wrap them in cellophane and put them in my candy boxes for Christmas gifts---the hard part is keeping my husband and sons from eating them first!",
