But I should have followed my instinct on this and reduced not only the cooking temperature but the cooking time as well.  It also would  have been helpful if the recipe specified how the chicken breast should be cut\u2026into strips, cubes, etc.  Unfortunately, the chicken cooked at 5-7 minutes per side over medium-high heat TOTALLY overcooked the chicken, and then you add it back to the sauce at the end to warm up for another 5-7 minutes.  What\u2019s really a shame is the balsamic-soy sauce is so darned good, but the overcooked meat resulted in a less than favorable dinner. last night.  But the sauce is sooooo good, and the recipe itself is so easy, that I\u2019ll try this again reducing the cooking temperature to medium and with far less time cooking the chicken.  I\u2019m giving it 4 stars based on the tasty sauce.  I know these changes will result in a 5-star rating in the future.",
