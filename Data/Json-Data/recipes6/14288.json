                "reviewBody": "Keep in mind that ultra-bitter turnips do exist (they were not well watered). However mild turnips are typically what is found in stores. Either way most turnips are very easy to turn into great food. Bitter turnips need a little extra help is all. When/if you have especially bitter turnips try comparing this recipe to the Turnip Casserole at this same site. In that recipe the turnips do not even hide behind other veggies. It is sweetened (can use stevia) much like a sweet potato casserole (reference that recipe but add more sugar IF needed because of bitter turnips). For most turnips the Turnip Casserole is sweet and light. Using all turnips or only some turnips in any sweet potato recipe cuts calories down a LOT so it really is worth a few tries. Me? I'm a fan of turnips several ways now! Allrecipes has helped us develop some of our own favorites! Turnip fries don't go well with everything but they are fabulous with Reuben Sandwiches especially dipped in ketchup and mustard together (sounds funny but it's really good). Turnips sauteed in a bit of oil and butter then seasoned with a bit of stevia or sugar S&P and balsamic vinegar to taste? It's now one of my favorite veggies. Also for anyone who likes horseradish and caramelized onions there is a mashed potato recipe on this site that includes horseradish and caramelized onions: working some (or all) turnips into that recipe is divine (and of course cuts calories while upping veggie intake). Fabulous! Enjoy!",
