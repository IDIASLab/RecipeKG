                "reviewBody": "This recipe leaves out many important pieces of information. For example you will need to pulse the almond paste with the sugar in your food processor until it is almost granular or your cookies will have lumps. There is no need to let the cookies stand for 30 minutes before baking - they will just form pools on your cookie sheet. There is no way in the world this cookie dough will go through a cookie press - it's far too thin! Do not try do make these on aluminum foil - they will stick. Best would be to use SilPat - a silicon mat costing about 20. The 25 minute baking time is too long - try 21 minutes. Finally if you want to make them into sandwich cookies (as is shown in the picture) try bringing 1/2 c. heavy cream to a simmer pouring it over 5 oz. chocolate and stirring until smooth. Bring to room temperature or slightly cooler - so the chocolate mixture will solidify - and then spread it between two cookies to make a sandwich. I gave it two stars because w/the above modifications the ingredients can be made into cookies (albeit not cookies that look like the picture) but the recipe is very sloppily written and I do not recommend it.",
