I made the suggested changes of adding 8Tb OJ and 8Tb butter and orange zest from 1/2 an orange...and instead of using a biscuit cutter, I just flattened the dough to 3/4\" instead of a 1/2\" and cut into triangles.  I ended up with 8 good sized scones so I increased the baking time by 3-4 minutes.  They were awesome tasting- the zest really brings up the orange taste up a notch.",

This had a funny texture more like a cake/cookie- I really think the odd texture came from the addition of extra orange juice. The mixture was very dry before adding the extra juice so perhaps you could add extra butter instead to give it a better texture? It was good enough but I wouldn't classify it as a scone & I certainly wouldn't serve it to royalty lol. I probably won't make this again",
