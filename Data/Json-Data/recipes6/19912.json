If it does smell funky, take it back. Thanks Rena!",

I marinated the tilapia in lemon, some steak seasoning, minced garlic and oregano. After an hour or so I breaded them, put them in a baking dish, added a slice of Swiss cheese to each, tomato on top and lemon slices along the sides. Cooked it 350* 23 mins. Came out delicious!

I used cheddar cheese for personal preference and baked at 425 degrees for about 14 minutes.  The cheese was nice and browned and I loved the flavor of the tomatoes and oregano on top.  A very different way to prepare fish from the usual lemon butter sauce, and oh so so so good!!",
