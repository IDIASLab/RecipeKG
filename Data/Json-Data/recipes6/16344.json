I have no idea why it's called that as kids aren't allowed to eat such sweets at school. However, there's a major difference between how we make them compared to the recipe:  Here we add the thick vanilla custard before we bake them, not after. After you've rolled the buns, let them rise - then you can easily make quite a big dent in each bun. Fill with the custard, but not to much or it will run over the sides of the bun and make a mess. Don't worry though, if you're like me and like a lot of filling. The custard will puff and fill more than you think. After the skolebrods are baked, chill them somewhat,  put on icing (powdered sugar + egg whites) and dip in shredded coconut. Yummy :-)",

There is no way you can fill them with pastry cream- the best you can do is top them with it. My one deviation from the recipe was to dip them in a powdered sugar glaze then unsweetened coconut before attempting the pastry cream \"filling\" (which by the way is very good- I had no issues with the recipe for pastry cream.)I had seen this glaze/coconut in every other online recipe for skolebrod. While the toppings I added and the cream were good the roll underneath was so dry so unflavorful (even with the cardamon-which I love) that there is no way I would ever attempt this recipe again. Too expensive- too time consuming and now I am left with 22 rolls no one will eat.",
