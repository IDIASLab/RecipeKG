The powdered sugar was an interesting addition to the egg batter\u2026it worked!  I had a few pieces of brioche bread left, so I think that made these french toast sticks even better. They browned up beautifully just with the butter-flavored nonstick cooking spray, no butter needed. Served with sugar-free syrup,  but the recipe submitter is right, you really don\u2019t need it, and I most likely won\u2019t use it in the future. I also like the way the nutrition info breaks down, so this can be enjoyed guilt-free.   Quick, easy, and tasty breakfast enjoyed this morning with a cup of coffee and some fresh cantaloupe.  cole332002, thanks for sharing your recipe, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing!",
