I prefer using cream, because I like it creamy.  I would definitely recommend using at least whole milk, and not going below that.  Otherwise, it would be too watery, and not at all like a true Bisque.  Also, I use canned tomatoes.  Two 28 cans work perfectly.  Last night I used crushed tomatoes, because it was what I had, and the boyfriend loved the bits of tomato, but I have also used tomato sauce, and I think I prefer the smoothness of it.  Either way, it is a fantastic recipe, and fun to play with.  It seems to come out great however you manipulate the ingredients!",

I have made both and the fresh is 10x better. Take the extra time. (if you don't have a food mill, just Blanche the\nTomatoes [put in boiling water For 10 seconds, then into Ice water]. The skin will peel right off. Take out the seeds, then run the tomatoes through a food processor or blender.) Follow the rest of the instructions! I personally add 2x the dried basil, and also add about 8 fresh basil leaves. Use half and half instead of milk for a creamier texture. I would suggest using 3 cups instead of a full quart, for more tomato flavor. Also, I add a little garlic powder. It's very easy and forgiving to make. Defintely give it a try!",
