I can see adding rum & pineapple juice instead and making a pina colada smoothie! Endless possibilities. Great recipe!",

He liked them alot. I did add two more ounces of vodka since we have a highter tolerance for alcohol. He was able to have two or three and feel good. It was a nice mellow buzz and he did not have a hangover in the morning. I'm crediting that to the dilution of the alcohol with a healthy ingredient like orange juice. I could be wrong... but that is my guess.:) I even had one... Nice and tasty.",
