Part of the fun was going and shaking the jars for months which sounds strange, but it built up quite a bit of anticipation and also, it was nice that we could both be involved in a project... for some reason I can't get him excited about knitting or making candles, lol.  The only problem we had was that once  the cordials were bottled, no one believed that we had made them ourselves!  \n    Because it's been a poor berry season here, I'm going to take the advice of one of the other reviewers and make this with plums this year.  Thank you for sharing not only a great recipe, but a fun project!",

No need to sterilize or process jars due to high alcohol content- just use clean jars, pour boiling water over jars & lids to thoroughly clean before proceeding.\n2. Vodka is great & provides a cleaner berry taste. Rum is also great, but use a high quality rum for smoother taste.\n3. For a really clear end product, strain through 4 layers of cheesecloth then a new coffee filter for each 1/2 quart as filter will get clogged.\n4. Freeze the berries for ice cream topping etc - they are delicious!",
