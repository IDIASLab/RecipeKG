The dressing is good but not unique; as with other sweet mayo/red wine vinegar dressings I've tried I didn't even come close to using the called-for amount of sugar. (Normally I do try to follow recipes as written but I also know our tastes.) My husband and I agreed that we sort of wished there were something else in the salad but neither of us knew what; with such a creamy dressing cheese would be redundant and nuts didn't quite seem right. Cucumber maybe or apple? Anyway this is totally fine and made for a nice change but I doubt we'll make it again. Thanks anyway!",
