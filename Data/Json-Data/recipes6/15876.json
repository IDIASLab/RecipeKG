This is supposed to be cake like on top and have a sauce beneath it.  Let it cool before eating and the sauce gets thicker. Serving it with ice cream or custard will cut down on the sweetness if you don't like your desserts sweet. I think the person who got a \"salty\" result may have used baking soda instead of baking powder.",

The cake part was the same but I reduced the sugar and water to 3/4 cup each for the 'pudding'. I used light brown sugar and got a thick pudding consistancy under the brownie. It baked in a convection oven for 35 minutes and I did let it cool and served it warm! Forget about leftovers!",

So I used it and a half cup of water and hoped for the best.  Gooey underneath, a brownie crust on top, there wasn't any of the wateriness that people complained about.  I made it in a round cake pan and it was so good!  I think I'll probably make it like this again in the future.  I used dutch processed cocoa too so it came out very dark and deliciously chocolatey.  Will be perfect with ice cream.",

One tablespoon cocoa just wasn't enough. I ended up with 3 tablespoons cocoa in the brownie batter and 2 in the brown sugar mixture. It came out very pudding like and was just delicious. The only other little change I made was to use butter instead of shortening because it's what I had. Awesome recipe!!",
