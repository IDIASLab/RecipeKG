When the cake is still warm, remove from tube\r\npan, and drizzle with a glaze:mix one cup powdered confectioner's sugar, with\r\nenough fresh lemon juice to be runny, ( a consistency like Elmer's glue ).

                "reviewBody": "Definitely an awesome cake. I tried this recipe yesterday, and it was DELICIOUS! I baked two cakes, one using a loaf pan and another one using a BUNDT pan. After reading some reviews, for one of them, I tried sprinkling some icing sugar on the pan after oiling it, and it did add a little caramelish-crunchy side to the cake that I liked. My bf prefers cake to be plain, so he prefered the other one (without sugar sprinkled).  I also added two tsp of vanilla extract instead of one and I used real lemon juice:) And finally, I baked it for around 70 mins too, and it was perfect: the crust was a nice shade, and it was yummy! Am glad I tried this recipe:))\n\n=UPDATE=\nI tried this recipe around 5-6 times already (all with great success!!)and I noticed a definite change in taste if I beat the butter and the sugar with an electric mixer and if I just mix the butter and sugar MANUALLY. When I beat it with a mixer, it tastes great but it is definitely BETTER if you beat the butter and the sugar with with a wooden spoon. It has a richer taste. Just make sure to beat it well (until the mixture is uniform). Since it's done manually, the sugar will not be creamed with the butter, but don't worry about it coz when it's cooked, there is no grainy texture or anything. Ah, and it tastes AWESOME with almond essence instead of vanilla:)",

And the reason why the ingredients and the fairly standard measurements of them are so classic and traditional (note other, similiar recipes) is because it WORKS.  This is one, fine pound cake.  Moist with a delicate and tender crumb.  Exceptional, actually. I made half a recipe and used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of Creme Bouquet flavoring.  I also added about a cup of fresh blueberries and baked about 30 minutes in a mini rose Bundt cake pan.  I drizzled it with a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Absolutely first rate and delicious.",

I substituted brown sugar for the white and left out the lemon flavoring since I didn't have any.  My bundt pan is pretty old and I'm not even sure how many inches in diameter it is.  So, being on the safe side, I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan.  It turned out perfectly and was completely cooked in about 50 minutes.  The sides of the cake started pulling away from the pan, and so I knew it was done.  Even though the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar...this cake was NOT overly sweet.  The brown sugar complemented the buttermilk flavor very well.  I will keep this one in my recipe box!!  Thanks a million Cathy.",
