These puffed up beautifully and were thick but also light and fluffy. I didn't have any issues with batter running off the sides of my waffle maker which I REALLY appreciated. I made several batches of this particular recipe and I really don't have any complaints. I'll use this one again (with the added half cup of flour and teaspoon vanilla) once I run out of waffles in my freezer again.;)",
