The cooking times are off. 4o minutes for a boneless chicken breast even if wrapped in bacon gets you dry chicken. I tried lowering my times to 34 minutes and at 410 and it was still dry. So: lower the cooking time to 30 minutes tops; 25-28 would work for any size chicken breast. The cooking also affected the cauliflower. It was overcooked a bit bitter and the garlic and parsley overwhelmed. Next time I will take off the garlic and the parsley cook it with onion and shredded carrots see if that works better. Because of that I think that instead of thyme I would season this whole thing with sage instead of thyme: While at that; I will try skip the sugar mix and instead brush the bacon with some maple syrup and maybe sprinkle some fresh-ground pepper. I think that all these flavors would make this dish a whole lot more coherent. It is up to you guys to try it though:)",
