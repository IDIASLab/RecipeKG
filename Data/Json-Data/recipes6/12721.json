I use a gas oven so perhaps that has something to do with it.

It gave it a nice \"light\" peanut butter taste ( and I did use the raisin filling. Maybe next time with the peanut butter Strawberry Preserves? ) In place of the raisins I would try figs...This would be the closest to the old favotite cookies \" Fig Newtons\".",

I used apple cider instead of water and replaced the lemon juice (which I didn't have) with apple cider vinegar. Also I used about half golden raisins and half regular raisins and I think it really made a difference! Just sweet enough! Oh and since everyone said it was getting too crumbly I sprayed a little apple cider on the base layer after pressing it into the pan. It was still a bit crumbly but it stayed together enough for people to pick it up with their hands and take a bite. Great recipe!",
