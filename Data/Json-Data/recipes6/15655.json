I altered this recipe a bit and served it to a group of 30 people and it turned out fantastic.  \r\nI added the following: 1 green pepper sliced; sliced mushrooms; two 11 ounce cans mandarin orange segments (juice drained); 1 small can rice noodles.  I also thought the dressing was way too spicey (hot) so I changed it too, which made the salad taste much better.  Dressing: 2 Tbsp white sugar, 2 Tbsp white vinegar, 3/4 Tbsp sesame oil, 3/4 tsp ground dry mustard, 3 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce (I used Angostura brand which has less sodium than other brands).",
