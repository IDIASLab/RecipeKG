The peanut butter flavor is just enough to offset the chickpea flavor very subtle. I used only 3/4c sugar and 1/2c butter (what I had) and 3/4c oats. I added cinnamon because everything is better with cinnamon:) I might even use less chocolate next time (I can't believe I just said that) because the cookie flavour is just that good. Thanks for a fantastic recipe! This will be a treat for my GF friends.",
