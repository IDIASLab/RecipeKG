Also your ingrediants MUST be room temp. that is very important. and if you lay a piece of tin foil loosly on the top of the pan it will avoid over cooking the top of the cake.",

That time it also tasted great and had the dense heavy texture I love. Very easy to adjust the cooking time/temp for the texture you want if you are even slightly experienced with cheesecakes. The taste is wonderful not too sweet and pairs well with many toppings. One thing though if you want the \"fluffy\" texture don't top it until right before serving or it will fall!",

Then mix well with the cream cheese mixture. It will thicken it even before pouring into the pan. I also used parchment paper instead of foil and it turned out very well. I cook it for exactly 1 hour and then let sit on the counter for an hour. Also leave in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. It's okay at 4 hours but much better if it has been refrigerated for a day. ",

Follow the recipe exactly except bake it about 10 minutes longer.  Let it stay in the pan until it cools some before removing the form.  -Also some of you may be mixing in the whipping cream with the mixer.  When you add the whipping cream, only stir it in.  That may be why some of you are ending up with too much for your pan.  Also, the pan with the water helps to keep it from cracking and helps it to bake evenly.  This is a very light cheesecake with a rich taste and delicate creamy texture.  Very pleasing!  I am testing cheesecake recipes for a future restaurant, and this just might be the one! Thanks ",
