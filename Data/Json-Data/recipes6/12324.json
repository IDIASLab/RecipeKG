I placed them on a rack with some tin foil underneath so the icing wouldnt drip on the counter... After I iced the last cookie I started over with the first and dipped them again.. They tasted like glazed doughnuts when they were completely cooled... I added them to my Christmas goodie and had requests for the recipe.. Im gonna try them with mashed banana next time and then maybe a mixture of pumpkin and banana.. mmmmm Kiki (Brampton ON Canada)",

One BIG difference though I used a tin of ED Smith Pumpkin Pie Filling as they didn't have puree. I also patted down the batter after spooning it on the cookie sheet so they were not as cakie. Also the icing was a bit sweet but only if you iced the whole cookie so I just drizzled it across them and WOWIE amazing. They turned out phenominal. Thanks for the recipe.",

I actually got more than the 4 dozen - I used a 2 tsp cookie scoop, and ended up with small round cookies that I just could dip in the icing - they looked like little bon bons.  I thought the icing was perfect for these cookies - the brown sugar gave a nice caramel touch, and the icing hardened nicely so they didn't all stick together on the plate.  Will make these again.",

It tasted just like a hard coat of sugar on top.  I made the mistake of making the frosting before I was done baking all of the cookies.  The frosting hardens very quickly once removed from heat, and you can't spread it on the cookies.  I did just reheat it and that made it smooth again for a short time, but I had barely finished frosting the cookies before it had completely hardened again.",
