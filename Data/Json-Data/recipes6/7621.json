I'm sure they need more than 20 mins to chill before rolling.  So mine are more oval shaped.  The chocolate also definitely wouldn't set at room temperature for 10 minutes.  I put mine in the freezer for 30 mins and then they had a nice chocolate shell.  I'm going to keep them in the fridge.  A nice decadent \"healthier\" treat though.  PS. I melted my chocolate chips in a double boiler (bowl on top of pot on stove).",
