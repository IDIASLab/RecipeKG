The first time round there wasn't enough wet ingredients for the top layer of bread, which ended up dry and crunchy.  For my guests I added two additional eggs, sprinkled a little nutmeg between the layers of bread, and some on top too. Most importantly, I dipped the bread in the egg mixture before adding it to the casserole dish, to be sure the top layer was not dried out.  It came out perfect - moist, tasty, and beautiful. Our guests raved about the food, and everyone went for seconds - the most sincere food compliment I know.",

I may add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the egg mixture next time but it was delicious as written. Thank you for posting the recipe.",
