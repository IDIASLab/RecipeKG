Before I set up all the incredients in the saucepan, however, I sauteed a whole red onion in about 1 T salted butter.  Then I deglazed the pan with the vodka and added all the other ingredients.  A few other changes: I replaced the fresh parsley with fresh basil and replaced the garlic powder with an equal amount of fresh minced garlic.  I also added about 2 1/2 cups diced baby portobello mushrooms.  I followed some other reviewers' suggestion and only added 1/2 c grated Romano cheese because I didn't want the flavor to overpower the rest of the sauce.  Next time I think I will just add a pinch of black pepper (even at 1/8 t it was too much) and maybe double the amount of red pepper flakes.  This fed two very hungry souls, with seconds for each of them, and then there was still about half left to freeze.  Thanks for a great recipe! Everyone requests this when they're coming over for dinner!",
