My husband and teenaged sons who are quite adventurous when it comes to food all after 2-3 tastes pushed their bowls back and said they didn't like it. Oh well. I know this is a legitimate recipe because I did a search and found very similar variations. I like the history of the recipe but it is just too sweet. The incorporation of the bread just made it look a mess. Not a visually appealing meal either. Will stick to French Onion Soup.",
