If you feel comfortable experimenting to amend to your own tastes I recommend using this as a base and flavouring up to your desire. I remade adding in half a container of chopped mushrooms lots more nutmeg and ginger (I did taste test until it tasted right) then I added chopped Italian sausage as others had suggested. I would have added some red pepper flakes too if kids weren't at the table. I'll probably continue experimenting with this recipe until I find exactly how I want to tweakmit.",
