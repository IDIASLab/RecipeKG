Good texture good shape hold and without a bitter after taste that many hamantaschen recipes have.I would not recommend refridgerating the dough though. Dough should be used immediately after making. If one delays some extra egg & water solution should be used to seal seams before baking as the seams will rupture and spill goo everywhere if they aren't sealed. Use good quality jam and avoid using jellies as they tend to leak more.",

Mix one egg with a Tbsp of milk, and using finger, moisten the outer edges of each circle before filling and pinching. I had no leaking casualties at all.  I used to make these with my mother when I was little, and she was smiling from Heaven when I made this recipe. It is absolutely perfect.",

After doing a little research, I found the key to making this:  oven has to be 400 degrees to get it a little toasty, roll dough to 1/8 in and roll again to stretch it after you \"cut into circles\", only 1 tsp of preserves, and instead of pinching corners, fold and tuck.
