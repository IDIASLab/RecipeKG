This recipe, with its higher milk to cream ratio and the deliberate omission of vanilla, is an authentic recipe for Italian \"Gelato di Crema.\" To omit eggs, or to reverse this lower fat, cream to milk ratio in this recipe, effectively makes this ice cream, not Italian Gelato. The only flaw here, and certainly no fault of this recipe, is that our home ice cream makers cannot duplicate the slow churning necessary to create less overrun (air) which results in the creaminess and density gelato is known for, so this was a little on the grainy or icy side. This is just delicious, and truly Italian! If you think this would be  missing something without adding vanilla, just give it a try!",

It was perhaps (as one other person suggeted) a little eggy, but it wasn't too bad and the texture was devine. I used a 1-quart ice cream maker, and the recipe yielded about 3/4 of a quart, so in the future I will likely increase the recipe by 25% except for the eggs, which I think should balance the taste better. To flavor this recipe I used about 7 oz of Nutella, which gave it a delicious hazelnutty flavor, and I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because the Nutella is pretty sweet on its own. It came out pretty nice.",

We changed it up a bit since I had a LOT of half and half on hand we used that instead of the milk and added 2 teaspoons of real vanilla(accept no substitutes on vanilla in my book) but we missed a step and forgot to strain the mix before refrigerating it overnight. It took least than 20 minutes in the ice cream freezer and will double this next time because it wasn't enough for the beaters to really work on. If not for the straining issue this would have been velvety and smoooth from beginning to end of taste but because we forgot a film develops on the roof of your mouth and the spoon after eating this for a bit. Still delicious but DON'T FORGET TO STRAIN THIS!:)",

I don't know if it has a slower churn or not but I let it churn longer than I would regular icecream just in case. For the person who mentioned raw egg yolks keep in mind the warm cream and the reheating of the mixture actually cooks the yolks into the Gelato but the method is about having them cook smoothly into it and not lumpily. I've made it with melted Chocolate Vanilla Bean Coffee and Raspberries. Maybe next time I'll start doing some combinations and possibly some candy bars.",
