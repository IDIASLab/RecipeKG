The dough was super delicious; it tasted like Reese's Pieces. My only problem--and maybe this is because of my modification--was that there was WAY too much flour called for. I should have used about 1 1/2 cups. I had to knead in the next 1/2 cup of flour in and didn't even add the last 1/4 cup. The dough was very stiff--I rolled it into balls and smashed it. They didn't spread much at all. The cookies turned out tasty but a little too dry. Next time I will use much less flour to make them drop cookies like the recipes said.",

We cut back on the flour by a quarter cup and added a quarter cup of dutch-process cocoa powder. We also added half of a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. We used Reese's baking chips in this recipe. Absolutely perfect. We tasted a few right out of the oven and they were awesome. Adding the extra chocolate was an excellent idea on my son's part. The great thing about pudding cookies too is you don't have to worry about chilling the dough because the pudding thickens up the dough and adds stability so using all butter isn't really an issue. This is our new favorite cookie recipe.",

While I was baking I asked him why he bought the chips. He said he knew I was going to bake something and was trying to be helpful. Men. Sometimes they do get it right. Anyway these cookies are delicious. Will definitely put the recipe in my recipe box.
