                "reviewBody": "This is a fairly standard and very reliable recipe for classic lemon bars. Any criticism of either too much crust, not enough filling, too sweet or tart, or not sweet or tart enough is purely subjective, and can easily be tweaked to suit individual tastes and preferences. Having made lemon bars many times in the past, and knowing that I like a thicker filling than the standard 4-egg filling for a 9x13\" pan, I chose to use 1-1/2 times the filling for the same amount of crust, keeping all other measurements the same.  I liked the addition of the lemon zest in this recipe, and found these to have the perfect balance of juice and zest for a just right sweetness and tartness. If possible, use either a non-melting powdered sugar, or sprinkle the powdered sugar right before serving, as it tends to melt into the bars quickly. I had a taste for something lemon today, and since these are so quick and easy to make they quickly satisfied the craving!",

I followed the recipe as it was printed, although I decreased the temperature to 340 and kept a close eye on things, because my oven bakes a bit faster than it should. There was just the right amount of crust and just the right amount of lemony topping. Although some reviews stated they didn't look very nice, I disagree!  They looked fine when they came out, and after they cooled the top was certainly firm enough to withstand a sprinkling of powdered sugar. I'm definitely going to make these again, and i'm also going to try them with a mixture of lemon and lime juices.",

I didn't have enough lemon juice, so I used half a cup of lemon juice and half a cup of lime juice. They were fabulous. Make sure you whisk the filling until a creamy froth developes. When it bakes it will create a thin wafer of an almost merangue consistancy. Also DO NOT bake the crust longer than 15 minutes. It will be pale and not browned at all on top, but will be completely done, and a lovely golden on the bottom after the filling has been added and it's been in the oven for another 20 to 25 min. (max.)If the edges start to brown...take it out immediately. It is definately done. Be sure to watch it if you leave it in longer than 20 minutes. ",

If you add more lemon juice they can get too runny. But, you really do need to cook this longer than 20 mins (at least 25-28). I personally love the thick shortbread crust. Sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving or it just soaks into the bar (powdered sugar makes them look much more appetizing and pretty!)",

I had no problems with burning or overdone anything like I have with other lemon bars. I couldn't wait to cut into this, so I let it cool for about 20 minutes before I dusted it with confectioners sugar and another 10 minutes after that before I couldn't wait anymore. The crust is almost shortbread like and the filling is better than others I've tried. I think it's good as is, but for someone who likes more filling and a little more sour filling, I might double the filling next time and at least double the zest. The reviewer before me is right in describing the filling as close to a lemon meringue. NOTE: The filling looks to be thin and you'll worry that it won't set up. It will. It's supposed to look like that. EDITED: Once it cools, the filling's tartness comes out a bit more and it's quite creamy. I think some of the other reviewers are right in making a batch and a half of the filling. I think it might be perfect then. ",
