Anyway I had purchased a bag of frozen Italian green beans by mistake and went searching for a way to use them. This recipe made them seem very palatable! Since my husband is on a low carb kick I made a few modifications for that eating preference: using flaxseed meal instead of flour Truvia instead of sugar and crushed up pork rinds instead of cornflakes. He really liked it I however am still on the fence about green beans. Thank you Christine for sharing this recipe and giving me a new way to prepare green beans!",
