For some reason I had difficulty getting the custard mixture to thicken even after boiling for several minutes but added a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and then continued to boil for a minute. This would make a very nice light tasting dessert for the summer also. I think I would like to try it with flavored gelatin the next time.",
