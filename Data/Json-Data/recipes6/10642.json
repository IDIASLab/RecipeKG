Also, this never says what size of muffin tin is a 'serving' which completely changes your baking time.  That being said....I really love the taste of these muffins!  I think for anyone who said they were bland, I think it's because of the type of cereal they used.  I substituted the shortening with 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 butter.   I used raisin bran cereal and threw in a tablespoon of vanilla extract with the buttermilk (which really was 1 Tablespoon lemon juice to 1 cup of skim milk because I didn't have buttermilk). Half wheat flour, half all purpose.  I changed this to 36 servings (which really turned out to be 24 on a regular sized muffin tin).  I baked them for 18 minutes.  They turned out perfect.  Thankfully the next time I won't follow the directions blindly.   ",

My mom always had a big bowl of it in the fridge. we took a big glump of it and put it in the microwave. cook it until it's not shiney. Pour a little milk over the top of it and you have a quick super yummy hot healthy breakfast. \nThese are very versatile muffins. I like to get creative with different kinds of grain cereal. The first  6 cup should be something like All bran the other 12 can be anything from shredded wheat to granola. Granola is really yummy. I've added all kinds of dried fruits. I like to have a batch in my fridge around the holidays. It's super easy to make up a dozen to give to friends and family as gifts. It's the perfect quick fix",

                "reviewBody": "I made this last year and was SHOCKED at how much it made. It was WAY too much batter even for a family of 6. I didn't have a bowl large enough to store the batter. It took a large disposable 9x13 deep dish pan just to store 1/2 the batter (not including the bran cereal!!!). I did get 1/2 the batter cooked up (it was all I could fit into a gigantic canning pot at the time) and it was pretty good. Just be warned- this recipe needs to be MAJORLY scaled back unless you have a large supply of canning pots to cook it in!",
