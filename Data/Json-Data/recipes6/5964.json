Since there was only one review I was determined to make it exactly according to the recipe but I accidentally made two changes: I forgot to get broccoli at the store and I may have grabbed some ground venison out of my freezer instead of beef. It was still amazing!! I used my immersion blender on the taters after mashing them to make them extra smooth for the picky eaters who like \"Hungry Jack\" style potatoes. It went over very well with the whole family :) Thanks for the recipe! Love the Instant Pot!",

The order of cooking things wasn't quite what I expected, I usually saute meat first, then add carrots first since they take longer to cook, followed by the other veggies, but heck, it all gets cooked up in the pressure cooker anyway. I made a red chile sauce to substitute for the gravy. I like a little kick in virtually everything, a personal thing. When I make it again I'll cook the mashed potatoes on the stove, only because my pressure cooker accessories  are limited. Overall, five stars!",
