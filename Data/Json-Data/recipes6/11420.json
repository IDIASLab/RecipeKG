Had to use AP flour w/baking powder salt as I don't keep SR flour. This cake would be fine with only a powdered sugar dusting as topping but I went ahead and used the Vanilla-Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting from this site. I've eaten two large squares of cake already which I really have no business doing. But it is soooo good!!! This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing Denise.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of splitting the batter between two 9 inch cake pans. When I went to flip the cakes out of their pans everything went south! The cakes completely fell apart and I'm left with a terrible mess. I made this cake as a test run for my friend's baby shower and boy am I glad I didn't wait until the last minute! Since the cake still tastes fine I plan on letting my family eat it instead of just throwing it out. I would probably make the cake again but only in a 9x13 or as cupcakes. The taste is good but it turned out a little disastrous which never happens to me when I bake. I also agree with those who said the cake could be served just fine with a dusting of powdered sugar instead of a thick frosting. It's sweet as is!",
