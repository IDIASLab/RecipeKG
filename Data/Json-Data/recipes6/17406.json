I baked mine for 45 minutes because my cakes are usually done by the lesser time given on any package directions. Everyone loved this cake and I used chopped almonds instead of walnuts.  It looked just like the picture. A toothpick should NOT be inserted into the center and it should NOT come out clean.  It's supposed to be goopy!!!  The Pillsbury website says check it instead by making sure the top is set and that the cake has started pulling away from the edge.  Good Luck! It also says to cool in the pan on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours. Then cool 2 hours before frosting. ",

After the introduction of frosting-in-a-tub the boxed mixes disappeared. I made this cake yesterday and it is fabulous. I'd been having a terrible day and I needed an extra chocolate buzz so I doubled your frosting recipe and added 1 tsp of vanilla. OMG! This cake is to die for!!! Thanks again Annie! TO ISLANDREST: I guess the word fudge is a bit confusing. It's more a 'fudgey-like' layer about 2/3 of the way down inside of the cake. I'm going to make this cake again today!",

I reduced oven temperature to 300F and time of baking to 50 minutes ( my oven gets really hot!) It came out perfectly. Taste was ok not great. I think it was too dry so did my husband. My daughter liked it. I've never had this cake before so I believe this is how it is suppose to be as everything worked out fine. I might try it again maybe increasing the butter a bit? I'll take to the office tomorrow and post my co-workers opinion later. Thanks:) Ok! I'm back.. I didn't take to the office and after two days it tasted really good. Me and my daughter kept eating it:) I think it needed time to seat..I'll be doing it again:) Thanks!",

I did that and it plopped right out clean as a whistle. I was nervous because I was serving dinner to my husband's friends but it was a HUGE hit! The only change I made was to the glaze because I wanted it creamier. I added about 2 T. butter and melted in a handful of chocolate chips. The tunnel was perfect the consistency was perfect and I will definitely make it again!",
