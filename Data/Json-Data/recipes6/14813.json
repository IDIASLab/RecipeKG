Only wanted 1 pie so I made half of it. I added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa to it (did not add any extra sugar). I was almost afraid that it would not make a full 9 in. deep dish pie as I made my own crust. It worked out perfect. I accidently forgot to add the flour! So I cooked it about an hour. It turned out fine. The chocolate and egg whites stayed at the top and the bottom was custard. Thanks for sharing a great recipe I sure will use it over and over again.",
