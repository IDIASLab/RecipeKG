It is not necessary to actually use the entire mixture but you need to have enough butter so that when you heat the mixture it makes a smooth syrup instead of a grainy sludge. With the current amount when the dish cools it caramelizes and is nearly impossible to get out of the pan. 45 minutes is too long but 15 minutes is too short. I wound up having to check the under layers to see if they were done every five minutes. All that aside they taste wonderful!",

I used a whole stick of butter and added a tsp. of vanilla. I cut back to 1 &1/3 cup sugar and 3 Tbsp. cinnamon. I cut up the biscuits as directed and put them in a 9x13 greased cake pan. Melt the butter add the cinnamon/sugar mixture and stir and cook for a while to cut down on the grainy texture. I added 1 cup pecan pieces when it was at the texture I wanted and since this thickened it up spoon it all over the top. Bake for 25 minutes and like the whole family said \"de-lish!\"",

I only used 2 cans of biscuit dough b/c they were \"Pillsbury Grands\" (pretty big) and thanks to all the other cooks that reviewed this before me used more butter and cooked for less time!! Turned out pretty good and I wouldn't hestitate to make this easy dish again! Thanks Beth!",

Put in oven to cook at 30 minutes the biscuits had overflowd the pan topping fell off and caught fire in the bottom of the oven!! Pull aparts were still salvageable but not sweet at all. Had to mix up some cream cheese frosting before even the guys in my house would eat it.
