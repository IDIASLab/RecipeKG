One change I like to make is to not finely grind the espresso as suggested but rather leave it chunky. You might also want to sprinkle a few espresso beans on top for the ultimate java junkie desert! Next time you go the the grocery store check out all the new coffee/espresso ice creams & find which one you'd like best in this desert!",

Since I didnt make this exact cake I gave it a rating equal to what it currently is at (4.5) to avoid changing the rating. I used the recipe for the coffee syrup but instead of a sponge cake I used the traditional ladyfinger cookies. I also used about 1 litre of Chapmans brand cappucino frozen yogurt (a healthier option) and another of vanilla layering them. I assembled it in a springform pan wrapped in waxpaper to keep it upright and prevent leakage. I then shaved a bar of room-temperature dark chocolate overtop using a potato peeler (some recipes said to freeze the bar but that just made it flakey rather than nice long peels). Thanks for the awesome idea!",

I used bavarian expresso light ice cream from turkey hill and low fat coffee ice cream from Edy's. I did have a difficult time trying to soak the syrup into the sponge cake - next time I will pierce the cake. I topped the cake with chocolate shavings and wrapped it with lady fingers for an elegant look. I will definitely make this again... and totally suggest using bavarian espresso ice cream YUMMY!!!
