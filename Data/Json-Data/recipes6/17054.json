I doubled the recipe and used an 11 x 17 jelly roll pan.  I also have used different fillings instead of the jam, like apple pie filling, pineapple filling, and I've even used a chocolate hazelnut spread and almond paste in the middle.  This recipe is very versatile, be creative and try different jams, preserves and fillings.  The dough is stiff enough, it works with just about anything you put in the middle.  Also, for the top layer, I just crumbled some of the remaining dough on top instead of trying to flatten it.  It saved time and worked just as good.  The rest of the dough that I didn't use, I formed it into a ball, rolled it out, and made cut out sugar cookies out of it.  The dough also worked great as a sugar cookie dough!  Thanks for the recipe!",

When I made these I actually added an extra cup of butter for more richness, used seedless raspberry jam and baked them in a 12\u00bd x 17-inch baking pan for about 40-45 minutes.  I made them for our family Christmas party.  They were a big hit as everyone loved them.  My sister-in-law loved them so much she asked for the recipe.  (She calls them 'The Big Booty Butter Bars'!)  She made them for her family and to give away as treats to the neighbors.  I will definitely make them again and I will use other fillings as suggested by another reviewer (although the raspberry jam is delightful!).  Thanks for a great recipe!",
