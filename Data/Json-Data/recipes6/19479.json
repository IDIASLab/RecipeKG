Prep is simple I could mix all ingredients easily with just a fork. I cooked some bacon in the microwave for 45 seconds like Jules suggested that made it crispy when it cooked. This made a nice thin batter. However when it came to the cheese sauce nobody would touch it! I was the only one who did and I did not like it. It was salty. I had to scrape it off and use syrup. I still like the cheese sauce idea so I may try it again but make a sauce more like something you use in a welsh rabbit. If you do make this make sure you keep syrup handy just in case!",

I do suggest like others microwaving the bacon just enough to melt the fat off and make it crispy. The bacon does a lovely job cooking into the waffle. I had left over cheese sauce that I added milk and water (water cut the salty taste a tad) to. I whisked those together until I got a gravy consistency -next time I will make the cheese sauce even thinner. A little goes a long way. I also cheated and used corn muffin mix - same thing as cornmeal just extra baking powder in the box lol. Made 4 Belgian sized waffles. Worth a try for the curious minded.:)",

Yes the same waffle iron my DH's Grandpa used to cook waffles for him on finally gave out so I had to improvise a bit. I chopped the bacon in half laid down a strip then poured the batter over it on the griddle for pancakes. That didn't do so well for cooking the bacon so we fried the bacon up & drained it then added the crumbled bacon to the batter & enjoyed with the \"cheese syrup\" as it is apparently called at my house lol. They were tasty quick & easy & we all enjoyed them. As pancakes I give them 4 1/2 stars because I'd prefer them to crisp up a bit better on the outside & they are not quite the best I have ever had. I gave the extra 1/2 star because this isn't a pancake recipie & I didn't follow it to a \"T\". My DH says they would be better with some black pepper.",
