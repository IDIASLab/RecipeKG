I was making fried chicken one night, and I thought of chicken and waffles but I was still on this stuffing kick, so I decided to merge the two. By adding frozen waffles into my stuffing, the combination of sweet and savory was a huge hit with my fried chicken and has become one of my favorite side dishes.",
