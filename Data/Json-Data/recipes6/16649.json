                "reviewBody": "When I became vegan a few years back I found this recipe and it was a life-saver since I love chocolate desserts. I have tweaked it though. Instead of putting the pie into a graham cracker crust I usually use a chocolae cookie crust (there are vegan versions). I also add 1/2 a carton of Tofutti imitation cream cheese to the tofu because it makes the flavor and texture more closely resemble chocolate cheesecake. Let's face it -- this pie is too solid and heavy to ever compete as a faux chocolate cream pie but it can compete very nicely as a faux chocolate cheesecake. I layer the top with sliced strawberries and tell people it is a \"strawberry chocolate cheesecake.\" Sometimes I make it without sugar (using 2 tablespoons of stevia extract instead) but that can have a slightly bitter taste. I don't mind but for company I usually just cut the sugar in half (1/2 cup sugar 1 tablespoon stevia extract) and I think this is indistinguishable from using all sugar.",

                "reviewBody": "I tried this twice using 4 ounces of melted bittersweet chocolate instead of the cocoa. If I had rated it the first time it would have received only 1 star!. First off use a food processor only. I know the recipe says \"electric mixer\" but the mixer didn't blend the tofu properly and the pie came out grainy. Also I used Pillsbury pie crusts. The first time the crust came out a little soggy. Finally be sure you have \"silken\" tofu. \"Soft\" won't blend smoothly. I ate the pie anyway but it took a lot of Cool Whip! On the second try I used silken tofu from the dairy case and blended everything in the food processor. While the filling was being assembled I slightly pre-baked the crust. While still not quite as smooth as real chocolate cream pie it was much better especially if you are lactose-intolerant and can't have the real thing. Might be interesting to try this with a meringue topping.",

I served it with some toasted walnuts and fat free cool whip and made a low fat graham cracker crust. No guilt lots of flavor. Thanks!",

I read all the reviews carefully; the best suggestions 1. Use splenda it takes away the bitter choc /tofu taste(but only use half as much as the recipie asks for otherwise it's too sweet) 2. food processor makes a lovely smooth pie 3. Omit the vinegar.Thanks for the tips! I added a splash of \"Baileys\" which made it quite rich but good:) Also made a cheesecake base with vegan coconut cookies and vegan butter. Finally toppped with fresh rasperries and strawberries (it's summer here) and a scoop of vanilla soy ice cream. A perfect chocolatley dessert!!",
