I used 1 15-oz. containter of ricotta with same amount of eggs, mozzarella, parm, and replacing dried parsley with about 4 tbs fresh, and I replaced the 1/2 c. water with 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. red wine. Very rich and tasty. However, a word to the wise: I unwisely chose to use 1/2 lb. lean ground beef with 1/2 lb. sausage. I think this would be a good decision if.. and I do mean ONLY IF... you have access to good spicy Italian-style sausage. Do not use \"country\" sausage or any sausage with a sweet base. Our local store had sausage, but it's flavored with sage and maple. Good with eggs. Bad with lasagne. Other than that, very simple, comparatively quick, little mess and rather tasty. I would, in the future, try it with a little garlic, some fresh basil, a dash of oregano, and maybe some cooked shrooms added in. I wouldn't use fresh shrooms, as it may make the dish too squishy and cause it to not \"stand up\" as a lasagne should. Definitnely worth a try with some tweaking.",

When browning the ground beef I added some lawrys seasoning salt, freash onion, 2 freash chopped cloves of garlic, some parsley, oregano, garlic powder, and some italian seasonsing, then with making the sauce, I added minced seasoned tomatoes, seasoned with garlic and oregano.  I drained most of the juices from it, not all, I added the sauce, and added about a quarter cup of water to it.  Then for the cheese mixture I changed out the cottage cheese for riccotta cheese, and since I am a cheese freak I added a bit extra for good measure. It turned out fabulous!  I didn't know that you didnt have to cook the noodles, and I was a bit skeptic, but Thank you so much for showing me the way it should be done.  Oh and with other comments to it being soupy, i still added a bout a quarter of a cup of water to the edges of it, but for the last 10 minutes while it was covered i turned the heat up to 400 degrees, and then when i took the foil off, i only put it in for ten minutes at 375, just to be safe.  I served immediately and it was great.  I  am so thankful for this recipe, it was a wonderful romantic dinner!!!!Thanks!",

I still used 2 eggs, 8 oz (2 cups) of mozzarella and used lasagna sheets.  The sheets are slightly thinner than regular lasagna noodles and fit perfectly in a 9X9.  \nAllow a full hour for baking.
