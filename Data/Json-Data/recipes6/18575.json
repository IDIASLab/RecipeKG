I followed the recipe exactly (except for using a sugar substitute) but there just wasn't enough umph. I believe more garlic and maybe a little heat would benefit this sauce. On the bright side the pork is incredibly tender in about 3 1/2 hours. I served it on bowties with garlic bread but I think it would go well with rice after the spice additions. Also this recipe makes A LOT!!! I froze two large bags of it. This would be easy in a crock pot too.",

Also I used about 3 cups of white wine in this dish - it helped give it more flavour as it was a bit bland at first.
