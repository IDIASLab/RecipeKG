It's just the right consistency so it coats the slaw with a nice sweet and sour flavor but isn't overpowering. Very quick prep with a 16 oz bag of packaged shredded cole slaw. Definitely will be eating this regularly. I prefer to use angel hair slaw (the thinner the better). Chill slaw and dressing separately and mix together just a little while before serving.",
