Despite using Oscar Meyer (R) Center Cut bacon (which is wicked then and always crisps nicely) these still took way longer than stated to crisp resulting in soggy yet burnt pretzels (even w/the wire rack to drain the grease). One star each for the heat (which was a very nice addtion) and novelty but that's the best I can do. These won't be a repeater at the LTH house(photo to follow once I can get it to upload...).",
