I made the entire recipe stove top in my nonstick skillet, browning the breasts seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder first using cooking spray, removing them and then adding the sauce ingredients to the pan.  Let it come to a boil, and then turned it down to simmer and put the chicken back into the sauce until cooked through.  It was very good.  My husband is not fond of \"sweet meat\" so the sweetness level was fine for us, but some might like it better with more sweetness as directed in this recipe using brown sugar as well.  Reminded me of sweet and sour chicken and we enjoyed it.",

We mixed together all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl (We actually used pineapple Jam instead of crushed pineapple), then browned the chicken in a deep pan with the butter. Once the chicken was browned on both sides we poured the sauce over it and let it cook on medium until the chicken was no longer pink and the sauce thickened. Served over rice, and it was delicious!

The biggest differences were: I used skinless breast tenderloins and pan fried them in a little oil for a minute each side (just couldn't see how they would get brown otherwise); I used rice wine vinegar less sugar and fresh pineapple. I didn't have Worcestershire so I omitted it. I served it over noodles with a side salad.I will make it again. But I think I'll add some rough chop onion and green pepper - stir fried til crisp tender - before serving. That makes it more like traditional Chinese sweet and sour.",

Before I let it simmer and then cool I tasted this sauce and found it to be revolting the vinegar and soy sauce and salt was just \"too much.\" BUT after it has cooled a bit I've tried it and found it to be pretty tasty! Of course I also added 3-4 times the amount of brown sugar that it called for to counter the bitterness and saltiness. Overall after adding it to rice it wasn't that bad. The vinegar was still too much for me maybe I am just more sensitive to the smell. I do not believe in altering the recipe and then complaining that it was gross so I may try it again exactly as directed before I write it off. I think I may make it again thanks for sharing!",
