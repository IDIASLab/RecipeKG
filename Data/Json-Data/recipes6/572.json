Took one bite, looked at me and said, \"This is DEFINITELY a keeper.\" I did make a few minor changes. I used 3 large, 1/2\" thick, bone-in chops (browned as directed). I also added 3 cloves of pressed garlic (minced would also work) in addition to the onion and bell-pepper mix.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used a 14.5oz can of no-salt added diced tomatoes and about 15oz of canned crushed tomato, and then doubled the sugar, vinegar, & Worcestershire sauce. I generally omit the salt from a recipe, but in this case I did grind a little fresh rock-salt and fresh black-pepper corns over the top of the pork chops after browning them. I also placed 3 bay leaves in the sauce over each pork chop. I cooked it on high for 3hrs and placed it over rice (did not use the cornstarch).  It turned out REMARKABLY juicy with a wonderful flavor!!!!",

First off instead of brown sugar I added white since I don't like it too too sweet. Next I didn't have vinegar so I added one of my favorite dressings which is raspberry vinaigrette. Gave a nice flavor to the sauce. I added sweet peppers since my wife hates bell pepper when it's cooked but loves it raw. Go figure right? And also I added some minced garlic. Can't go wrong with garlic!!!! And I cooked it on low for 5 hours anything longer makes it dry out. And instead of putting it on a bed of rice I put ours on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and it was terrific!!!",
