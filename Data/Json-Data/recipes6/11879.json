Because of the complaints about the glaze I used the Simple Orange Glaze from this site instead of making the glaze called for in the recipe. I followed the cake part to a T. The cake itself is not all that sweet but it is good. Without the glaze it has more of a muffin taste than a dessert. I gave it 4 stars based on how I made it with an alternative glaze not based on the recipe as written with cake and glaze. I'd probably give the cake alone 3 stars.",

I ended up taking a skewer and poking holes in the top so that it could penetrate the cake. The bars are really sticky but I think that's just because there's so much glaze IMO. To my surprise there wasn't a whole lot of carrot flavor in this and I don't think it would hurt to add some finely shredded carrot to the batter. The predominant flavor is orange. FYI it took about five medium carrots to yield 1 cup of mashed carrot. The coconut adds a nice texture to these very moist and rich bars.",
