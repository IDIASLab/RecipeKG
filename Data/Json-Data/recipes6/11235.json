The 2nd, 3rd and even 4th day was even better. However, I very rarely have any left after the 1st day! It was simply awesome. All the flavors from the cake stay moist and the taste of the ricotta cheese was not overwhelming. I think this cake is better the next day and the 3rd day after making this cake. The key is letting the cake really set before serving. My kids loved this cake but hated the taste just after preparing it. I know we were anxious to taste it. Letting it sit in the fridge for 24 hours is worth the wait!\n\nThis is a great cake to make for a function the next day. I recommend not frosting the cake until the next day.  I sometimes add a little heavy cream. Part Milk/Part cream to the pudding mix.\n\nLove it! I will make this again and again!\n\n I have made this 5 times and it has simply been a hit each time. I am making another one tonight for the Office tommorrow! Thank You! Thank You! Just Awesome! I have also posted a picture of the Cake too!",

I had to make dessert for the bosses birthday and tried this. She loved it and so did the rest of my coworkers. I did make it the day before and frost the day we served it. The frosting in of iteself is delicious and I know I will use this on other desserts. I was afraid that the ricotta mixture wouldn't sink but it did. It had beautiful presence and everyone was wowed. Definately one of the moistest cakes to date. Thanks for the post.",

                "reviewBody": "This cake was very different and delicious! I made it \"light\" by using fat-free ricotta which worked out fine and Lite Cool Whip and skim milk. The ricotta filling sinks to the middle of the cake as it bakes and makes a \"layered\" look like a devil dog. I baked the cake (in metal pan) at 350 for just under an hour and it came out perfect. I cooled it for 15 minutes removed it from pan to a serving platter covered it w/ Saran Wrap and refrigerated it over night to set before frosting it. (The bottom looked alittle \"wet\" from the filling sinking through the cake when I removed it from the pan but after refrigerating it it seemed to evaporate and just make the cake moister.....not soggy at all which is what I worried about!!) The frosting is light and delicious like chocolate mousse. I decorated the cake after frosting it with chocolate chips but I think shaved chocolate & white chocolate from a candy bar would look even better. I will mkae this again. It's easy and very quick and perfect for a special occasion without spending all day baking and preparing.",

At first I was concerned that the cake will not bake through but during the baking ricotta layer sinks into the cake-mix layer and in fact the cake comes out with the chocolate layer on top. Once I made a half of the recipe in 8x8 form with about 3/4 of the ricotta and it also was good just a bit dryer (which some might even prefer). Most of all I like the frosting idea and have even used it on other cakes and desserts. Thanks Rene!",

I cooked it in a metal 9x13 and where the directions say 90 min thankfully I took it out at 70 min. I did let it set a full 24 hours before making the topping and serving it. As for the topping... not good just bland yet again (and not remotely close to mousse) you might as well buy the chocolate flavor cool whip save time money and a dish to clean.",
