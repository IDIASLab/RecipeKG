        "description": "This is my take on the oft requested miso-glazed, black cod, made famous by chef Nobu Matsuhisa. In addition to a taste and texture to die for, this is one of the easiest fish recipes of all time. A couple minutes to make the sauce, some brushing, a short wait, and you're broiling. By the way, I don't like to cook both sides. I like the heat to only penetrate from the top down. This makes for a lovely caramelized top, and a super juicy interior. Cooking times will vary, but simply broil the fish until the bones pull out with no effort, and the meat flakes.",

Otherwise, I followed the recipe precisely.  This is the best tasting fish dish we have ever cooked ourselves, and it took almost no skill to make it.  The best tasting butterfish I have ever eaten at a restaurant was served at Blue Ginger in Massachusetts, and I have to say the fish we cooked using this recipe was just as good.  We've been using allrecipes.com for many years, but I never registered for an account until now because I wanted to rate this recipe.  \n\nOne thing I noticed was that we had more marinade available than needed.  The black cod we used weighed about 19 ounces.  I broke it up into 3 different pieces and used a brush to very thoroughly cover all 3 pieces.  There was enough marinade left to cover 1 or 2 more pieces of fish.  Also, for reference, we had frozen our fish for a couple weeks before using it and it still came out fabulous when we cooked it.",

Because it's extremely delicate and needs to be served immediately.  \n\nBut a  client saw this and asked that I prepare it for her.  \n\nAs a trial run I went with the recipe but discovered that it was too sweet.   In addition, the concentrated miso paste; even though I used the recommended amount of white miso & the one I chose was sodium lite - it was quite strong.\n\nOn my next run, I left out the wine, used only 1 1/2 TBS of brown sugar - wanted to keep the smokiness - included \n1 tsp of honey & 1 tsp of white cane sugar, kept the sake and let it simmer - while stirring occassionally - for a bit more than 5 minutes.  \n\nWhich allowed the three different sugars to begin to caramelize a bit and blend with the miso and sake.    \n\nI liked the taste while it cooked.  Then when it cooled and I painted the filets to marinate & broil (on low) all the flavors were blending quite well.   \n\nWhen it was time to take them out of oven - I found that each flavor including the fish - for me - now had an opportunity to make an appearance and pop.   \n\nEach flavor dovetailed into the previous flavor, as opposed to having one/ two dominant elements.  \n\nThat's me.  Others love the recipe as is .  I was just looking for a way to keep the origins while finding a way to make it work for my tastes.",

I too used apple cider in place of the sake and Japanese wine as well as coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar. This was wonderful! I frequently cook dinner in two batches because we run a plate over to my elderly dad down the street so I did one broiled as recommended and one at 400 as suggested in one review.... I preferred the broiled version though it did create a lot of smoke. We'll definitely be having this again.",
