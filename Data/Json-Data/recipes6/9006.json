I worried that the lack of spices would make this bland, but I needn't have worried.  This is a hearty soup, perfect for a chilly autumn day.  At the table, I added a bit of parmesan and enjoy it even more.  My daughter, she's 6 and is very picky, liked it - although she removed the soggy bread.  My husband ate two bowls full and declared that it felt great to eat a hearty soup while enjoying so many veggies.  Amen!",

When I ladled the soup out, the bread was almost like a dumpling. This wasn't my most favourite soup but I loved using all of the veggies I had left after a week of not cooking too much, and had some frozen as well. I had a lot of leftovers so I added some cooked pieces of Italian sausage. YUM. I enjoyed trying this soup. Thanks TINATED.",
