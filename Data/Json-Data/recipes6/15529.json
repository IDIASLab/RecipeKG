I'm one of those that kept the corn syrup in and kept the baking powder at it's original four tbsp. I made the batter last night and cooked it on my griddle this morning. I had no problems. It spread nicely and cooked evenly. My whole family loved these pancakes especially with the syrup. The pancakes cooked up incredibly fluffy. I was pleasantly surprized. It really does taste like a cinnamon roll. This recipe's a keeper. EDITED REVIEW: I \"sift\" the ingredients together with a wisk before adding all the wet which I've also whisked all together in a smaller bowl. This prevents overmixing. If you make this the night before like I do let it sit out a bit before you spoon it on the griddle. This made nine large pancakes. NOTE: Adding chopped crisp bacon to this was a genius idea. It was so good it should be illegal. We ate every single pancake.",

If the batter seems a bit thick because you left off the corn syrup just stir in an additional tablespoon of milk. I made these cakes in this fashion and used a sugar-free syrup as a topping. It was so yummy! Thank you for a great inspirational recipe!",

The batter and the resulting pancakes are thick heavy - not nearly as light fluffy and springy as I would have liked. And rather than being pleasantly spiced with cinnamon it was almost cinnamon overkill which left a not-so-pleasant cinnamon overkill aftertaste. I did make the powdered sugar syrup which was actually sort of nice but to tell you the truth I think I'd rather have the cinnamon in IT rather than in the pancakes! Fun to try and probably could be tweaked to be made better (a little more melted butter and milk a little less baking powder and cinnamon) but I wasn't thrilled enough with these to try and give it another shot.",
