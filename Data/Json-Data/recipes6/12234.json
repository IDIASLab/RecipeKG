Does anyone have an opinion which is better- sour or sweet?? I rated it a 4 star- recipe did not state whether butter should be cold or soft and it was not ready after baking 25 min. I baked it til golden brown with great results- a delicate crispy layer on top-soft and chew in the middle. UPDATE: I tried it with fresh sweet cherries. The batter looked so wet-so I added 1/8-1/4 cup flour. A mistake! It came out too dense-like a heavy cake. Still a great recipe. Next time: It will be sour cherries- with no extra flour.",
