I omitted the cayenne and hot sauce because my son doesn't care for anything too spicy and I knew my husband would douse his serving with hot sauce regardless. I also only added 1/2 cup of water but still had plenty for the slow cooker. I was a little concerned when it first started cooking the vinegar scent was strong but it mellowed throughout the day and mmmmmm the end result was delicious. I would recommend this recipe for families like ours with varied tastes it is a good tasty meat and people can add more hot sauce or barbeque sauce to their own servings.",
