It says vegetarian and I am vegetarian and vegetarians still consume Dairy, such as the half and half and the cheddar cheese that was listed. \n\nI never thought to add liquid smoke to potato soup and I found the flavor to be amazing because of that. even my family that refuses to eat vegetarian stuff when they find out it's vegetarian ate it.  I did add some salt and pepper and a extra dash of the liquid smoke.",
