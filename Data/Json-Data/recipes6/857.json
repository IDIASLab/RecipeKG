I used a can of com stock apple pie filling, because it's already sweet I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar, I put the apple pie filling, pecans, dried cranberrys, and butter in a bowl and mixed them, then I poured this into the prepared 13x9 pan.  I never have egg substitute on hand so I used another reviewers suggestion and used 6 large eggs, milk and cinnamon. Mixed eggs with other ingredients and poured it over day old Italian bread that I bought and put in fridge to \"dry\" out a bit, then I followed the directions as written.  This is beyond good !! I love that you make it a head of time and let it sit over night, with my family's busy schedule it was a nice treat for my husband to wake up to the great smell of this French toast bake.  Thank you for sharing !!!!!",

I used 6 real eggs in place of egg substitute, otherwise I made this exactly as written.  Next time, I would increase the pecans to a full cup - I didn't really get as much of the flavor or crunch that I wanted with a half cup.  I also recommend making the night before, and flipping the bread once several hours before you plan to cook.  This helps make sure the liquid component is fully absorbed.  I had some sections of bread that were completely untouched by the egg mixture when I didn't flip.  Lastly, I will plan to add some sort of simple brown sugar syrup over the top of the dish next time.  As is, my husband still wanted maple syrup on top.",
