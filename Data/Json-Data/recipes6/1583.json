The oats flax and chia seeds all absorb the water so the easy fix is to add more boiling water at the outset. I added vanilla almond milk (and a LOT of it) to the bowl and still didn t get the consistency that I like. But I enjoyed the crunch from the nuts the pop of fresh flavor from the blueberries and the amount of fiber which will keep me from snacking this afternoon. I m giving this 4 stars because it tastes good and what I see as an issue can be easily resolved at least for me.",

The oatmeal wasn't too sweet and had a nice nutty crunchy taste and texture. It was slightly thick but not too thick to eat or stir. You could easily add more water or top with whatever milk product you like for a thinner oatmeal. It made a huge serving so I refrigerated the leftover to eat later this afternoon. Thanks for a healthy breakfast I'll be making again.",
