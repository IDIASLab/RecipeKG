The recipe was easy to follow, and the cake tasted good.  There are a few things that I didn't like about the cake.  The crust of the cake, was too hard.  I think the sugar that is added in the pan before baking, may have had something to do with it.  Also, the chocolate in the middle didn't melt well for me, it left a ring around the cake and some came out on the sides of the cake, which made a mess of the pan.   I didn't drizzle the chocolate on the top as suggested, I just skipped it.  I think the next time I make it, I will mix all of the chocolate in with the mix, and not sprinkle some in the middle as suggested.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!  I would definately make it again, with a few modifications.",

The only thing thats wierd is that the cake does not turn out to be chocolate like it shows in the pic. It turns out yellow but my whole class loved it so much they did not care if it wasn't chocolate because there was so much white chocolate and dark chocolate drizzled on top that it was still good!!! SO GOOD!!!I also changed the recipe a little...(See you dont have to put in almond extract even tho the recipe calls for it. I made one cake with it and one without and they tasted the same. It dosn't really make a difference.)
