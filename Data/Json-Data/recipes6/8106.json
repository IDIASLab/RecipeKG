Great way to use up vegetables in the fridge too! In this case I browned the bacon, drained most of the grease, added finely chopped multi-colored bell peppers and onions, briefly sauteed that, then added it to my beaten eggs (which I just mixed with salt and pepper and half-and-half) along with some sliced black olives and garden fresh chives. I baked it in a pretty, shallow buttered casserole. No muss, no fuss, free to do other things while it baked, and it cut into individual servings perfectly. This will definitely be a re-do.",

Easy and fast and DH loved it. I used Costco Precooked Bacon and used about 10 pieces. Nuked for 1.20 seconds on paper towels. Let cool and then crumpled. Stirred all ingredients in the pie dish once I had added them all. Will make this again!",

It still came out awesome and fluffy. I did adjust some of the of the additives however I used: 1/2 of a yellow onion (diced) 1 red pepper (diced) 2 Tbs. of hot paprika 6 slices of bacon total It went into the oven in a 13x9 baking pan for only 25 minutes.

Last night I microwaved six slices of bacon and tossed the bacon onions and about 1/4 cup of green pepper into the food processor and pulsed for a few seconds and stored in the refrigerator. This morning I prepared a 5\" x 7\" glass baking dish. I beat 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk added the salt and pepper. Poured the egg mixture into the prepared baking dish and then sprinkled the bacon mixture over the top followed by 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. Baked for 30 minutes. Puffed up nicely and cut into nice firm pieces to serve. I'm glad I added the green pepper and next time I make it I will add some garlic and maybe nutmeg. A dash of hot sauce would add to it as well. Overall an excellent versatile brunch/type recipe.",
