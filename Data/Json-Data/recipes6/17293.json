I did make one mistake which is that I greased AND floured the pan. I don't recommend flouring the pan as it makes the sides of the cake look dull. I had not baked a cake from scratch in close to 20 years and this cake turned out GORGEOUS -- too pretty to frost really. I baked it in a bundt pan so it took just under 45 minutes to be done. I drizzled the lemon-orange filling over the top as a glaze so it was a bit sticky since it wasn't meant to be a glaze but the flavor was amazing and really complements the cake. I served it at a brunch for friends and it got rave reviews. This is definitely a repeat for me!",
