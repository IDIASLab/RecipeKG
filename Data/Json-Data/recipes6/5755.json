This was my first time making quinoa chili or chili with no meat! This recipe sounded super intriguing so I just had to whip some up. The recipe couldn't be easier and it's ready fairly quickly. I couldn't find a tri-bean blend so I used Bush's Mixed Beans (mix of Pinto and Great Northern beans). For the chili seasoning I used McCormick's Tex-Mex flavor. The only thing I might change is to add a bit more broth (at least another 1/2 cup) bc I found the final product to be very thick. Also next time I will omit the first step of pre-mixing the broth and seasoning mix. These ingredients can easily all be tossed in together in step 2. Thank you ciao bella for the great recipe and providing me with some delicious and nutritious lunches all week!",

The quinoa absorbs most of the liquid--even seemed to do so after it was cooked and in the frig. Don't know if I'll make again as there are lots of other recipes out there for chili and/or quinoa. But if I were to come back to this recipe I'd probably add more liquid to it.",
