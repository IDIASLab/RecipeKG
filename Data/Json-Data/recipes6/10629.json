I made the brioche twice and found that I preferred using a little more sugar and 2 teaspoons of yeast. For the summer pudding I made a syrup with a couple packages of fresh frozen mixed berries water corn starch and brandy extract then layered it with slices of de-crusted brioche weighted it and set it overnight. The results were spectacular! I served this at my neice's baby blessing reception to rave reviews. Since the majority of the moisture in the dough comes from fat the brioche makes the pudding rich and utterly delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating brioche plain but in a dessert or with a stew amazing! Great job Linda!",

As suggested, I increased the yeast, sugar (nearly doubled,) and added a pinch more salt. The center of the braid was a bit doughy when baked per the diretions, but I had some difficulty rolling the strips so may have made them too thick (the braid was about 14\" long). Delicious served with pulled pork on top. The slightly sweet bread compliments the smokey, BBQ flavor of the pork.",

                "reviewBody": "If your dough seems dry, don't be afraid to hydrate with a little extra water, it wont hurt the dough.    Also, Make sure to let the dough rise once for about an hour before shaping it.  I would recommend folding the dough at 30 minutes to degas the dough and distribute heat evenly.  To fold, turn the dough out onto a floured table and bring the left side two thirds across the dough giving it a slight stretch and patting to down.  Next, bring the right side all the way to the edge of the left side (think letter fold), again giving the dough a slight tug as you bring it across.  Repeat the same fold from top to bottom. Return the dough to the mixing bowl and let sit for remaining 30 minutes.  When egg washing. I would not add water to the whites.  This will only dilute your wash mixture and you will not get as pretty of a shine.  When baking, you want the final crust color to be more brown then golden.  Try baking at a bit higher of a temperature (375) The dough will start to take on a beautiful rusted color.  However, the inside will still be a delicious pale golden.     a variation I like to do with this dough is roll it out flat, spread marscapone cheese that has been mixed with a little sugar and citrus flavoring over the center third, then layer strawberries and blueberries on top.  fold the outer two thirds over the center.  brush with whites and sprinkle with sparkling or cane sugar and bake.",
