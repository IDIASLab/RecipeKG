To turn up the heat, I added a teeny bit of habanero chili powder and that did the trick.\n\nAs a seasoned chicken fryer, I also added my not-so-secret ingredient to the flour mixture to make the chicken extra crispy: about a half cup of Matzo meal. Really!\n\nFinally, I have a trusted Lodge cast iron skillet that never lets me down on frying projects. The tricky thing is getting the oil temp just right and keeping it hot. If the oil's not hot enough, it makes for greasy chicken. If it's too hot, the coating burns before the chicken's fully cooked. \n\nAll that sounds like a huge hassle, but it's so incredibly delish, you'll be glad you made the effort!",

Harissa is an African spice and I buy the dry powder version. We make this recipe around every 3 weeks as my family cannot go any longer without it.\n\nThis recipe is absolutely a standby for us and we will eat it with salad or my son likes it with rice.\n\nI do not work for this spice shop but this is where I buy the Harissa.
