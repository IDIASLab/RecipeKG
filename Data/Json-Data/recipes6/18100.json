I added grated ginger and pieces of star anise into the cavity and used all the spice rub for the skin.  A notes of caution, watch duck very closely when increasing heat (especially if using a convection oven).  Didn't make the homemade plum sauce, instead heated 2 tsp. canola oil in saucepan until hot, then added 1 cup hoisin sauce (it will sizzle) and jusce of 2 limes.  Usually, peding duck is served with \"pancakes\" for wrapping the meat - instead, I used lettuce leaves to wrap the duck, along with basil leaves & mint, then added the sauce - fabulous!  Serve with fried rice or noodles.",

I bought two 5 pound ducks and marinated for 24 hours with a little garlic on in inside with the green onions. Also used fresh ginger. I don't have a steamer big enough so I just roast it at around 425 for 40 minutes, basting it every ten minutes, then I put on the glaze and turn the oven down to 350 for about 30 minutes glazing and basting every ten minutes then 250 till done.  When I need to crisp it I turn it to broil or 450 checking it often.  I wait until its internal temp is 165.  I serve with Wontons and rice.  Hope this wasn't confusing",

I didn't have a steamer but I had a roasting pan with holes on top  as well as a rack that went with it on top. I poked holes in the duck with the fork after I had it sit with the spice marinade overnight. I did place green onions and a chopped garlic clove in the cavity. I placed water in the bottom of the pan and cooked with foil cover at 375 degrees in convection oven for an hour. I drained the fat and then placed it back on the rack with foil. At this point I basted it with the soy/honey every half hour. (still returned foil on top) I tried to turn up to 475 but smoking and too hot. Turned it down to 400 and continued cooking, basting with the sauce every 20 minutes. It did get a bit darker and not too fatty. I turned on broiler for about 5-10 minutes to make skin crispier. Delicious. Friend who doesn't like duck and had tried peking duck before truly enjoyed it. I doubled the sauce recipe but used plum sauce instead of jam and used mango chutney (did chop up the bigger chunks). Delicious. First time making duck. Definitely a hit. Will make again. Took approximately 2 1/2 hours to cook.",
