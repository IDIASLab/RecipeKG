Freeze again and cut into individual serving sizes. Then I would dip the cake pieces into dark chocolate and store in my freezer. I would always keep some in my pastry case. I would serve the cake with some creme anglaise fresh berries and dollops of whipped cream. Heaven! What's Great about this recipe it that it Gluten-Free!",
