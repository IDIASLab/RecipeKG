Hazelnut meal in place of chopped nuts 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/4 c. mini chips. Dropped cookies on parchment and baked 15 minutes. Got 18 delicious light brown cookies. Next time will cut sugar to 1/3 c. and add 1/2 t. vanilla. I'm always looking for small batch recipes since we are empty nesters. Thanks for the start! Made a second batch cut sugar pecan meal and 1/2 c. chopped pecans in place of hazelnuts/chips plus 1/2 t. vanilla. Just as delicious!",
