I used quick cook oats.\" Other than swapping quick-cooking oats for old-fashioned I was faithful to the recipe and the pancakes turned out okay (very tall puffy) just not cinnamon-y enough for that to be a flavor name featured in the title. With butter and syrup they were good just not outrageously so.",
