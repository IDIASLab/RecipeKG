The recipe I've used doesn't call for any milk but the main difference is in my recipe the peanut butter cup is put in right after baking. I decided to try this version on a few. I think putting them in after baking works better -- the cookies look my attractive and there's less risk of them falling apart when removing from the cups. I did like the picture of an M&M in the center but was able to do this in the ones I put the peanut butter cup in after baking. The chocolate melts enough to keep the M&M in place. Also I bake 10 minutes at 350. Anyway they are very delicious!",
