I like to dust the greased baking pan with sugar and cinnamon. Before I put in the oven, I sprinkle the top with a crumbly mixture of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2-3 tbsp flour, 1/2 teas cinnamon, 2 tbsp melted butter and 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts. Yum!",

(This ensures your bread gets a good \"oven pop\" from the heat.  The baking powder reacts with the heat, therefore this initial heat will help your bread rise and give it a good peak.)  After the 5 minutes, lower your oven to 350 and cook the rest of the way.  If your bread starts to darken on top, but is still gooey inside, simply place a piece of foil on top and continue to bake as normal. Do not wrap the bread in the foil, simply lay it flat on top.  \n\nJust remember all ovens are different, therefore a bit of trial & error will help solve certain issues and hopefully teach you things in the process! :)",

                "reviewBody": "I've made this recipe several times and have varied it each time to see what kind of different results I could get.  Here's what I've learned:  First, grease (don't flour) a 9x13...second, increase the amount of bananas to about 3 ripe bananas and a HEAPING cup of sour cream...third, use brown sugar instead of white and fourth, don't allow to cool completely before placing in a Ziploc bag.  I usually cut the cake in half and freeze half while the other half sits in a sealed container on the counter.  It really retains its moisture when stored this way, however, you need to eat it rather quickly (like w/in 4 days..which is REALLY easy to do!)  This also makes a good \"cake\" if you mash half of the banana and leave half in chunks.  Then, sprinkle powdered sugar on top or frost w/ a cream cheese based frosting (or a tub of that flavored cream cheese)...it's a hit!  3 Years Later...I'm still being asked to make this bread, but I've made several modifications since my first attempt in 2006.  Here are my favorites. I use wheat flour now...it's just a healthier choice.  I use light sour cream now.  I add a handful of golden raisins to the mix as well as about 1/2 cup of sliced almonds (if I'm feeling really creative, I brown them first).  Lastly, in an effort to get more fiber into my diet, I add about 4 tbsp. of Fibersure or Benefiber to the mix.  ",

I mashed up 2 large bananas (a little over a cup) and used vanilla flavored yogurt instead of sour cream. I also threw in a teaspoon of cinnamon to give a little added flavor. I baked them in 2 loaf pans and they came out beautifully. I wish I would have added some chopped walnuts but didn't think of it at the time. Might try that next time.
