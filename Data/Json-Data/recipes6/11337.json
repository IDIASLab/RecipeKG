Despite my mistake the end result was rich decadent and had a heavenly flavor. The balance of chocolate to coffee was very nice. I will definitely make this again.",

I did use coffee instead of water it didn't give it a coffee flavor just enhanced the chocolate. Just a little tip before you just dump the eggs into the hot chocolate mix take a little of the chocolate and beat it into the eggs to bring up the temp of the eggs so they don't scramble on you. I used a gravy ladle to add about 1/2 cup of the chocolate into the eggs. I topped with whipped cream and a berry sauce. Will definitely make this again.",

To answer an earlier reviewer my husband doesn't like coffee so I left that out of the mix only to find it VERY watery... so I kept adding powdered cocoa and a little flour until I thought it was the right texture. I couldn't begin to tell you how much I added- just a little at a time until it looked right. So yes you can do without the coffee and it tastes fabulous.",
