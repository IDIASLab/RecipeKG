Second time I omitted both ingredients added napa cabbage and thinly sliced snow peapods. Also a small amount of Five Spice powder replaced the cayenne. The trick is to let the filling cool almost completely before trying to fill the wrappers. Doing it when it is still hot makes the wrapper get soggy.",

For example I used a bag of \"coleslaw mix\" (shredded cabbage with some carrots) instead of bean sprouts and water chestnuts. I saut\u00e9ed the cabbage mix with onions mushrooms and seasonings. Added shredded leftover chicken. Think this would work well with sausage pork even hamburger. I added just a bit of sesame oil to the cornstarch mixture. Lots of room for personal tastes without losing the intent of the original recipe. I did use the cooking spray and my Silpat sheet. Would like to try brushing on some peanut oil instead. Did not add the sugar since we served with sweet and sour sauce. Thanks!",
