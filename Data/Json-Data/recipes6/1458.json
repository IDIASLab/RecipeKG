I also use a mixture of different dehydrated fruits as well as the raisins.  I like to use is raisin bread or Cinnabon bread. Other than cinnamon I like adding nutmeg allspice and hold cloves. I\u2019ll then take the clove and cinnamon sticks out After sun boiling then add the fruit and nuts  to plump it up. Then add the bread and cheese into the pot for well make it thick And you think so that all you have to do is put it in the baking tray and bake it for a little bit and it comes out great.",
