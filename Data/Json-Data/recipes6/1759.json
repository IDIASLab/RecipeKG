I made this at home and took a small slow cooker to the gathering to keep it warm. Then to celebrate the team win we had to try different adult beverage additives:)) One person liked brandy two or three liked amaretto four agreed hazelnut was the favorite... we all loved this thank you cookincrazy:) for a terrific drink with or without the booze! Will make again!",

I bought some cider that seemed unusually tart. I thought this recipe might help sweeten it. The flavor didnt much change though. It was more or less just hotter. I may have to check other recipes to tweak the base or start out with a sweeter cider. Hot cider is a nice fall recipe. ty",
