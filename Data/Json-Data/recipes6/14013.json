A little time consuming and dirtied a few dishes but this is a really nice cake/cookie dessert. My frosting layer was really thick not pourable by any means I just spread it over gently and then swirled. I would like this much better without nuts and it doesn't need the layer of choc chips in the center and it doesn't need the swirl thing done it looked prettier before but it was great just as it is. These are rich and very thick. My teen loved these and devoured them he was very disappointed when they were gone. We ALL thought they were better cold than at room temp though so keep that in mind when serving these to guests. Thanks it was fun making something new.",

I would recommend(I wish I read reviews first) not to cook after adding the marshmallows and just pour the chocolate on top. No swirling is necessary. It looked perfect when I had drizzled the chocolate over the top but once I did the swirl it looked like a big mess and I think that attributed to consistency of the top. The only change was I did up the unsweetened chocolate in the brownie layer to 2 ounces and kept the rest all the same. Will try again because they were tasty!",
