The nutrients from the chicken sweet potatoes and tomatoes make it a great alternative to chicken noodle soup especially during \"cold/flu season\". Instead of dissolving the flour in 2 Tbsp. water I used 2 Tbsp. lime juice and served each bowl with a lime wedge. The lime juice creats a delicious contrast against the cilantro. Also I suggest using at least 1 1/2 - 2 lbs. of chicken. 1 lb. of chicken seems to get lost in all the other flavors.",
