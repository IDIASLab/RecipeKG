Never put dressing in the fridge.  You must heat the dressing to a boil to make sure the sugar is dissolved. I always use at least 2-3packages of ramen noodles and slivered almonds. And to cook the crunchies I use 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Always add crunchies after you have mixed the dressing in.  I have used coleslaw salad instead of napa in a hurry and no one ever complains. However napa is the best.",

Just make it a new recipe and post it under a new name! \n\nThis is a great salad! I have been making this salad for several years and always get rave reviews. I have had more requests for this recipe than I can count. I always use 1/4 cup of butter, melt it in a skillet and brown the almonds, sesame seeds and noodles. Increase the noodles to two packages, minus the seasoning package. The noodles are better if you break them up well, I put them in a plastic bag and break them with a rolling pin, just don't pulverize them. Use sliced almonds rather than silvered almonds. The dressing is much better if it is heated and boiled for the 1 minute, it dissolves the sugar. This salad is just not the same without the Napa cabbage. I cut the whole cabbage in half, cut each half three times lengthwise, then slice it across in about 1/2 inch slices. This works well for me. I must stress to let everything cool before mixing with the cabbage. Mix at the last minute before serving because the crunchies will get soggy, as stated in other reviews.",

I can see where this would be an easy \"make ahead\" dish to transport to an event and assemble just before serving.  Adding this one to my \"Favorites\" List.  UPDATE:  I have found a way to \"lighten\" this salad without losing any of the flavors:  I spray the crunchies with butter spray before I bake them & use brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar.  Other than the oil, you have a Weight Watcher's friendly meal on your hands.  A regular in our house now.  My teenaged son loves it too and the dressing is GREAT on baked chicken!",

Gladlocks will leak! Toast the crunchies on the stovetop (in REAL butter never the stuff in the tub!) and put crunchies in a container or quart-size ziplock bag. When you toast the nuts in real butter (not margarine) as the butter browns the nuts become a little bit salty and they offset the sweetness of the dressing. Do NOT use the seasoning packet; too much unhealthy sodium and MSG. Throw it away it was only twenty cents and you're doing your body a favor. Nuts are heart- healthy; we prefer a mixture of pine nuts sunflower seeds and sliced almonds because they look better and add texture. Use your nicest large bowl and tongs and use the pre-shredded bag-o-cabbage to save time. When you arrive at your destination put the cabbage in the bowl. As people line up to eat add the dressing a can of drained mandarin oranges 1/2 cup of dried cranberries (Craisins) and the crunchies. Stir well to coat everything but don't add the dressing too early or it gets soggy. This salad does not do well as a leftover. Thanks for the post!",

I used pre-shredded cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage. I doubled the recipe and added shredded chicken and a can of manarin oranges. I also reduced the vinegar by an 1/8 of a cup and replaced it with Mandarin orange juice that I drained off the oranges. The crunchies were fantastic! The only thing that I did differently is that when toasting the crunchies I sprinked about 1 teaspoon of the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles over it and mixed well (I used the chicken flavor). This added just a touch of saltiness to them which matched perfectly with the sweet and sour dressing. This was a hit!",
