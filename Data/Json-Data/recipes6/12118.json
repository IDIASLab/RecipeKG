It sounds so good and I like the idea that there is no added fat in the batter but the finished product was kind of a boring cake-like bar not what I envisioned at all! I ended up melting the rest of the bag of chocolate chips and using them as a coating for the bars. This did help. I will say that after the bars sat for a few days in a sealed container they were more moist and tasted much better I gave some away and ate the rest myself. I don't think I would make this recipe again the ingredients are expensive and the final product isn't that great.",
