This is the way southerners make cucumber salad alot. I used white vinegar because that is what I had on hand and I also added some fresh chopped dill. This is a good recipe and it always goes over well with any meal during the hot summer months. Use onion as little or as much as you like red onions can be strong so you have to adjust to your personal taste. This is a good simple recipe that anyone can make.",
