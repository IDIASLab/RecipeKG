I baked the squash for an hour, then cooled it.  I used half wheat, half white flour.  And since I doubled the recipe (too much squash), I ended up using 4 cups of squash and doubled everything else.  Since my muffins were bigger, it took between 20 and 25 minutes to finish cooking the muffins.\r\nThey're moist and slightly sweet - perfect for me since I'm not a huge fan of really sweet muffins.  I'm not sure what went wrong for the person who wrote the negative review, but I think baking the squash definitely helped, and realize that for 12 muffins, use 1 cup of squash.",

I had serious misgivings when the recipe listed a 1/2 pound of cooked squash but I followed it anyway. A 1/2 pound is ALOT of squash!! There is no way that you could have weighed the squash. Did it just LOOK like a 1/2 pound to you? How about converting it to cups? I used a dietary scale and ended up with so much of the mixture it looked like I could have baked two or more pies not muffins!! I ended up actually doubling the flour/sugar mixture and adding it to what was leftover and even then I baked 24 muffins. I wanted to take them to my parents for a weekend brunch but there is no way I would serve these to anyone. I make alot of recipes that I find on Allrecipes.com but have never rated them. This is the first time I have done this because of how poorly they turned out. Never again.",

My husband who is not a \"weird muffin\" kinda guy devoured three of these after they came out of the oven and thanked me for the nice change from our typical squash soup recipe. This is a dense moist muffin recipe and the result will disappear quickly from your table! My 8-month old son also loved them... they're not too strong tasting and very healthy. The tip for 1/2 lb of squash = 1 cup from one of the reviewers was very helpful - thanks! I also substituted half of the white flour with whole wheat (which likely contributed to the density of the muffins) and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.",
