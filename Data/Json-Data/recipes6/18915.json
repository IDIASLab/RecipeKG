Instead it was more towards a sponge-cake (not nearly as soft though) or a cobbler like another reviewer wrote. My batch may have been a smidgen flatter than desired since my dish was a little bigger at 9.5 x 13.5 inches; and I didn't quite spread the cherry-pie filling close enough to the edges. I \"buttered\" the dish with butter-flavored cooking spray. Also I'd never used lemon zest - I just ran a somewhat fine grater over a lemon and obtained 1/2 tsp. of finely grated stuff. However my palate wasn't discriminating enough to discern the lemon juice and lemon zest but it probably helped the recipe anyway. I used the suggested canned cherry-pie filling and it tasted perhaps a bit \"unfinished\". However slightly reheated in the microwave it was maybe even better! Unfortunately I let it sit around one day too long and had to throw away the last third of the batch because little white spots of mold appeared (that hasn't happened in a long time!). So my advice to everyone is to gobble this up quickly. I'll add it to my recipe box. Thanks for a nice new treat.",
