We usually don't make the bbq sauce because we have some excellent sauce on hand but we make the cole slaw using 1/2 the mayo and dressing ingredients and also bake home-made kaiser rolls. I do have a question however. I was wondering if I am correct in assuming that the pork does NOT get returned to the cooking liquid? I noticed that some recipes have the shredded pork stay warm in the liquid.",

We aren't real spice lovers in this house but I do love flavor so I cut the black pepper red pepper flakes and salt in 1/2 and there was plenty of spice for us. Even though it was 3 T shy of rub there was still plenty for my 3-1/2 # roast. I didn't have any hot sauce but I did have a jar of Herdez Traditonal Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce in the house that I used in it's place. I also didn't have beef broth and had chicken broth to use up. My maple syrup was bad so I skipped that step knowing with the honey and molasses there would be plenty sweetness. There was plenty (maybe too much) liquid for the amount of meat and I really think you could getaway with 1/2-3/4 the amount of liquid (at least for the electric pressure cooker). For the coleslaw mix I cut up my own cabbage and carrots. I used an electric pressure cooker that had presets that only allowed pressure cooking up to 40 minutes and I have no idea if that was a low pressure or not. I ran my cycle twice for a total of 80 minutes under pressure. It could have used about 20 - 30 more minutes but it was tender and shreddable as is. I think there was a good balance of sweet and spicy. This is the first time we've ever had coleslaw on pulled pork sandwich and I really enjoyed. Even though I made a few alterations to the recipe we enjoyed it. Thank you for the keeper Valerio!",
