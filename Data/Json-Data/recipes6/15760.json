I really can't stand eggs and maybe this recipe was made to mimic omlets?!? if so it's perfect that's why it's getting two stars. I could not eat more than one. They should be called Golden Penny Omlet Bites they may look like pancakes but definetly do not taste like them. Try the cheddar corn pancakes from this site they are a million times better and not eggy.",

Unfortunately I'm not the best pancake maker so the first few were raw and then the next few were burnt. I liked the flavor though it wasn't really cheesy making me think the same as the other person who said that it was just adding more calories. I liked the sweetness though some thought they were better with salt and pepper , I did not. It may need something to top or dip them. I'm not sure if I'll make them again (since it was a fluke in the first place that I made it).\n\nUpdate: Only used half the batter the first time around. A friend who makes pancakes well finished off the rest and we ate them with our hands as appetizers with salsa. Much better and have changed from 2 stars to 3 stars, possibly add more spice to pancakes for a savory taste (chili powder perhaps).",
