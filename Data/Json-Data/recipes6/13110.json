When it was time to pull it out of the oven I found that it was hardly done cooking. The edges were starting to turn brown but everything else was still like batter. I didn't know what to do so I turned up the heat for another few minutes until the cake solidified. This caused the whole thing to turn a bit too dark. Perhaps had I started with a hotter oven the whole thing would have turned out better. However taste wise I wasn't that impressed. These squares were really spongy - perhaps because of so many eggs. I was looking for something more \"fudgy\" - dense and chewy.",
