But I only added 2 1/2 cups of sugar to 5 heaping cups of rhubard. Just so I could add more sugar as I wanted. Once it was all cooked down I tasted it to see it to see if I wanted more sugar. It was so sweet I couldn't even eat it it made my teeth hurt. And it still called for mooorrreee sugar. So I went to the store and got five more stalks of rhubarb added that and added the zest of a lemon and lemon juice. I didn't even add the jello for fear of how much sweeter it would be. It is still so sweet no one will eat it. If you actually made the recipe like it called for I can't even imagine. I am going to try and use all the 'jam' I made as a glaze on meat. Move on do not make this unless you like your jam pure sugar with no rhubarb flavor!",
