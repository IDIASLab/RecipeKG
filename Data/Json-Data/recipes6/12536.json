Had I read these first, I probably would not have made these.  I actually followed the recipe to the T on the first pan...and they came out actually looking perfect, but tasting really bland...and they weren't at all chewy. I added 1/4 flour and 1/2 more peanut butter to what was left for the rest of the cookies and only cooked them for 15 mintues. AFter that, they were PERFECT!!!!! And NOW...after all of the changes, they can officially be called SOFT AND CHEWY PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES. ",

The only thing I did different was added a small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chunks and a small bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. They are as someone else described an unusual consistancy before dropping onto pan. Very gooey and it did take the full 22 minutes...no matter how Narly they look at first. keep the balls/drops no bigger than a tablespoon as they do spread out like flat gobs of goo. In the last 7 minutes they miraculously take cookie form it's amazing because they really do stay gooey looking for a while. I think if you turn the tempature up higher the dough edges will burn so don't be tempted. a bit sweet but what a perfect cookie. exactly what I was looking for and my male co-workers said they were orgasmic. The finished cookie looks just like a cookie you'ld buy at Mrs. Smiths in the mall. I won't be using any other peanut butter cookie recipe again. Thanks. P.S. If the peanut butter flavor isn't strong enough for you it is mild don't touch the recipe I'd recommend just adding nuts or peanut butter chips. They stay soft & chewy longer than any cookies I've ever made. I made these twice now and refridgerated the dough before baking the second time much easier to ball came out exactly the same. Yum!",

I decided to make them again but this time added 1/4 c. more flour a bit more peanut butter chilled the dough rolled them into tiny balls and did not press them with a fork....wow...after doing that they came out awesome! Few changes needed to satisfy my personal taste but it worked out because everyone loves them! Overall great recipe thanks:)",
