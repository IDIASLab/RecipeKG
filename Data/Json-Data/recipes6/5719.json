Used regular whipping cream since that's all I could find and it was delicious! I forgot to thaw out the corn before mixing all together but I was still able to mix it by breaking up the frozen corn. Also this only needs to cook about 2 to 2 1/2 hours otherwise the part against the side of the crock pot starts to burn (and my corn was frozen to start with). Use a crock pot liner and cleanup will be a breeze especially with this recipe. I want to try this with low fat half and half or lite cream to see how good it is to lower the fat content so I can make this more often. Will post the results. My whole family loved this. Definitely will be making this again. Thank you for sharing Kymmie.",
