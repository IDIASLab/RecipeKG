To upped the eggnog to 3/4c changed the vanilla extract to rum extract and to compensate for the added liquid I upped the flour to 2 1/2c. The changes worked like a charm the cookies were soft and chewy and very eggnoggy. I don't know if the rum extract would have made the same impact on the original recipe but I'm not going back the 2nd batch were gone in a flash!",

After putting it in a pastry bag with a tiny hole at the end I drizzled it over the cookies then sprinkled red and green sugar over it to give it a festive look. It took a bit for the cookies to dry but it seemed to go faster when I put them in the oven that was barely warm after having it shut off from baking for a while. YUMMY this way!",
