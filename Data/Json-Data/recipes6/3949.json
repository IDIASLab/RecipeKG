I added raisins, but I minced them up with a sharp knife so you get nice little bits of raisin throughout. If you\u2019re new to making muffins like I am, I had to go searching for some additional instructions: you fill the muffin cups about 2/3 full, and you let them cool for just a few minutes in the pan but transfer them to wire racks to finish cooling. Wonderful recipe!",
