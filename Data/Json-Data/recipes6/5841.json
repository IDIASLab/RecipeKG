The wild rice adds a nice crunch and nutty flavour. I served this nacho style as written but then added it to a taco shell. I mean it has 'easy' and 'taco' in the title. What more does dinner need? The rice is super fast the meat and seasoning cook quick too. Next time I'll add an onion with the meat but even without it it is a five-star keeper. I couldn't find the Ready Rice in my area so I used Uncle Ben's 10-minute version. Thank you RainbowJewels for your recipe.",
