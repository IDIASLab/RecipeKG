I used a box of cheap red wine (5 liters for $10.00)and as was suggested, I used spiced rum. I also added lots of other fruit, including apples, pears and cherries, which was really pretty in the glass pitchers. I did have to keep a close eye on the fruit soaking in the rum and sugar that was in the refridgerator, because every time I went to make more sangria, I had to fight off people eating the fruit. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.",
