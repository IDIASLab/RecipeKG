I mashed all veggies but left some larger veggie bits for texture. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and 2% milk instead of skim. I used the medium size velveeta and tore it into pieces so it melted faster. I served in bowls topped with a bit of parsley and put a warm breadstick right in the bowl. Add milk when you reheat leftovers as the soup thickens. Rave reviews from everyone!!!",
