I've made it with different kinds of sausage (pork turkey and chicken) but the best I've found has been from Publix greenwise italian chicken sausage - the jenny-o spicy italian turkey sausage is a close second. With either of these I don't have to worry about measuring the drippings I just leave it all in the pan as it's leaner than pork and not nearly as oily. Also as I like spicy more than my wife does I'll use Sriracha on my plate and she'll use a sweet pepper relish. It's just so darn good!",

I'll make sure to have cheddar on hand the next time I make this. I didn't cook the squash on the stovetop nearly as long as the instructions called for fear of overcooking, and the texture turned out perfect according to my tastes. I also added a little beef stock to it before going into the oven because I thought it would have been a little dry otherwise. It was very tasty and I will definitely make this again!
