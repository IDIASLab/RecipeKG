The cream filling was great, so I wound up using a double batch of filling for one batch of cupcakes.  I didn't like the idea of pushing it in from the bottom (sounded way too messy for me).  So I used a knife and cut a cone shape out of the top, spooned the filling in, and replaced the top.  (Just be sure to wait until the cupcakes have cooled, or the cream filling just melts!)  Then I frosted them using the great chocolate frosting recipe mentioned in another review, and you can't tell they're anything but chocolate cupcakes until you bite into them.  My boyfriend says these are now his FAVORITE dessert!",

It doesn't take any longer to make than the boxed mixes either, so try it.  As for the reviewers that thought it was too much work to put the filling inside, it's actually very little work and quite a bit of fun.  All you need is a pastry bag and tip.  Each cupcake takes about 10 seconds to fill.  I made my cupcakes in the pan without wrappers, filled them after they were cool, then arranged a dozen or so to a platter and drizzled them with chocolate ganache.  They looked surprisingly elegant for cupcakes.  Everyone loved them and ate seconds and thirds.  I can't wait to try the same cupcake recipe with different fillings.  UPDATE:  I have made these cupcakes dozens of times since my first review because they are always requested.  I like to ice them with Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  I have also filled them with chocolate cream cheese frosting, nutella, and whipped peanut butter frosting.  I like to fill them from the top and then spoon the glaze on.  After the glaze is set, I pipe a small flower in the center of each cupcake with whatever filling I used.",

By the way I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix for the cupcake and a vanilla buttercream for the frosting (my son's favorite). The cream filling recipe with the changes I made generously filled 24 cupcakes. Everyone loved the finished cupcakes - kids and adults!",

Also I have been just piping the filling into the top of the cupcake with a piping bag and small tip...that way you can leave the liner on and the hole at the top is covered with frosting.",

The filling and technique will work with any cupcake recipe. The filling is light and sweet. Instead of milk, I used coffee creamer and the texture and flavor were just perfect. As for putting the filling into the cupcakes, I went from the top instead of breaking the bottom paper, (which makes for an unholy mess on your serving plate.) I was going to frost them anyway, so it didn't matter that a dot of white filling showed through the top. I used a pastry bag with a #22 tube. Buried the tube all the way to the coupler into the cupcake. I squeezed until the cake started to expand, then eased off the pressure as I withdrew it. Worked very well, and it's infinitely easier and faster than cutting the core, removing it, filling and replacing the core. No need for any such gyrations. If you have cake decorating equipment, I recommend this time-saving technique.",
