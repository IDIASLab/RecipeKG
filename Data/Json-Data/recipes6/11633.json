The only difference is that I use brown sugar instead of white.  I think it gives it a more \"carmelized\" flavor and texture.  I also omit the spices all together.  I don't care for spicy sweet potatoes, just SWEET sweet potatoes :0)  Be sure to use \"real\" butter for this as that is part of the fabulous end result!!!!  Thanks!",

About 5 minutes before serving, I transfered them to a casserole dish and added chopped pecans then topped with marshmallows and browned it in the oven. So yummy!",

Her secrets for stove top yams: cook the butter and sugar first to get it thick and syrupy (but don't burn it), then add the yams, this way you don't over cook the potatoes and get them all mushy and falling apart. Also make enough sugary mixture to \"cover\" the yams, this way you don't have to keep turning and busting them up and all mushy. If you have to, turn the yams over with a small spoon one by one and \"make sure to cook on low\" so they \"slightly\" bubble. Don't let boil vigorously, this turns the yams to mush. You won't perfect this dish on the first try, but if you master it after 3-4 times, you'll get the perfect candied yams and they will ALWAYS be requested on Thanksgiving. We don't add other flavorings, don't need to, but we do add marshmallows on top and stick in the oven just to brown. Even picky kids eat em up, enjoy!      was to cook ied yams.
