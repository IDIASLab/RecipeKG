Also, because the dough is somewhat sticky, I put ALOT of flour on the countertop before trying to roll it out.",

One of my daughters teachers even commited to her how good the cookies looked and the smell of the cookies. I did however follow the advice of some of the reviewers I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 1/2 cups of real butter. I added cinnamon instead of the vanalla. Also I put the cookie dough in the frig over night. Floured my board alot dough was a little sticky. And the dough rolled out great. I kept the oven tem. at the suggested 325 but I cooked the cookies for only 10 min. First 5 min.on the top rack and then 5 min. on the bottom rack. The cookies turned out a light golden color that were crisp on the out side edge and soft on the inside. I made the cookies thicker that what was suggested. I was able to make 36 heart shaped cookies from the dough. This recipe is a keeper.",

They are soft yet firm enough to handle while decorating and they really have a nice flavor. I think this is because this recipe does not call for shortening. I also think the trick to making these cookies the best they can be is: refridgerate till hard (1 hr 1/2) roll them out quickly and maintain a 1/4 inch thickness. I rolled them out on parchment paper and then removed the scraps of dough around the cut outs. Then I placed my parchment on a baking stone. Add two minutes to your first batch if using a stone.",
