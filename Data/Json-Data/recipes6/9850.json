I made the dough in my bread maker and let it rise on a large cookie sheet covered in plastic wrap. It got pretty big so I flattened it out to form into the pan about 30 minutes before baking it. The sauce was awesome. The only thing I modified was I cut the garlic down to 4 cloves (that was plenty of garlic!) and I added a tablespoon of brown sugar along with the white sugar at the end. I also mashed the tomatoes with a potato masher once they were in the pan to smooth them out a bit. We topped with deli salami and pepperoni. My husband said it\u2019s the best homemade pizza he\u2019s ever had! I\u2019ll definitely make it abd the sauce again!",

After the pizza dough baked it was very soft and pillowy but was not crispy on the bottom.  I was very disappointed as we could not pick it up with our hands, we had to eat with a fork and knife. No instructions on what size pan to use.  I used an 18x13  and added the remaining oil that it called for. I think that is way too much, I should have used less, but wanted to follow the directions exactly as they called for. I will make again with less oil on the bottom of the pan and maybe my rating will be better.\n\nThe dough 3 stars  because we could not eat it by hand.\nThe sauce 5 stars  all the flavors were there.",
