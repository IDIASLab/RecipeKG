We did not have access to maple extract so we substituted 1/2 tsp butter extract and 1/2 tsp rum extract. The flavors melded well together. A perfect blend of sweet and savory.\n\nWe added the icing right when the dish came out of the oven, which allowed the icing to melt across the entire 9x13 area. We had to encourage the icing to get between some of the nooks and crannies with the corner of a spatula.\n\nThe result in the 9x13 dish is only about 1 inch thick, so next time wewill try with an 8x8 dish.",
