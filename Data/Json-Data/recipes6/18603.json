                "reviewBody": "Ok i've got to come to the rescue of the original poster here... this *is* a tasty way to make rice pudding (albeit time-consuming). I have a similar recipe (thanks to the Modern Family Cookbook, published in 1953). There is a trick to making this recipe work... and that is a large (as in wide, not deep!) baking pan, so the mixture is quite shallow, with lots of surface area to allow evaporation to take place. I made mine in a large lasagne pan once, that was a bit of overkill and it dried out too fast... i had to add extra milk, believe it or not! A 9x14 pan works fine. If you use a narrower-but-deeper casserole dish, you'll experience the \"rice soup\" problem. Here's my recipe, basically identical to the original poster's:\r\n\r\n1/3c uncooked rice\r\n4 c milk, scalded\r\n1/4 c sugar\r\n2 tbsp butter\r\n1/4 tsp salt\r\n\r\nCook at 300 degrees for 1.5 hours, stirring every 15 minutes with a fork, turning under the brown top and scraping the edges down. \r\n\r\n",

After the arduous task of stirring every 20 minutes for 2 hours and then letting it set for 30 minutes the pudding was still soup. Finally determined to eat dessert I whisked in 2 eggs and cooked it on the stovetop the old fashioned way. It thickened right up in about 5 minutes. Then it tasted great! I recommend using the stovetop method for easier rice pudding.",
