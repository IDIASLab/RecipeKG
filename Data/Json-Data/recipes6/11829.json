I thought it's supposed to be problematic sometimes but melting it worked like a charm for me. Also for the flour I used unbleached though that shouldn't make much difference I don't think. I refrigerated the dough overnight (about 13 hours) and making the balls and rolling them in the confectioners' sugar was actually kind of fun. I wish I had more than one cookie sheet because this really did make about 4 dozen cookies (24 servings of 2 cookies each) and it took a long time to bake all the cookies. Oh and I baked them for 12 minutes the high end of the range given. The Woman I Love tried the cookies too and wants to give them a 5-star rating. I also gave a couple of dozen cookies to her co-workers who also raved about them. I only give them a 4-star rating because I'm a perfectionist but these are very yummy cookies - a little soft and brownie-like and kind of attractive. And very easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe which I'll be passing on to The Woman I Love.",

I do need to figure out how to make them again and have them not be so flat as these cookies are supposed to be a bit fluffy as well and crunchy. I have made these in the past following the instructions exactly and they turned out perfect but I was also at a higher elevation at the time as well. So I believe that the elevation that I currently reside in is the reason they were so flat. However the picture for this recipe does have them being flat so maybe it is the recipe",
