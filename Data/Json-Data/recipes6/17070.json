They almost became slightly soggy after spending a day in a storage bag.  I liked the flavor/ spice combinations used, but those did not outweigh the texture issue.  Sorry...",

Don't get me wrong...A GREAT change from banana bread and I would make again.  By the way I used REAL butter and golden raisins and 3 banana's in mine.   **Am bumping from 4 to 5 STARS!** AFTER letting them sit overnight I would give these 20 stars!  Gave some away to friends since this recipe makes so much and am still noshing on mine...these are even BETTER when they sit a day or two.  SO....5 STARS!  Like I said a GREAT change from banana bread and muffins!  Next time I will try some crushed pineapple and nuts in these....just for kicks and giggles.",
