I substituted Splenda\u00ae Brown Sugar Blend for the brown sugar, and used Egg Beaters\u00ae for the eggs in an effort to make the muffins a bit more in tune with our diet.  Both subs worked well.  Used a small cookie scoop for the filling the muffin cups, and I topped each muffin with a pecan half before going into the oven.  They  baked perfectly at 12 mins, and I ended up with 24 mini muffins, exactly what the recipe indicated.  Christie, thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed these mini muffins.",
