Didn t really understand why you put the butter sauce on the top of the rolls covered with aluminum foil let sit for 30 minutes and then remove the foil to bake. I didn t wait for 30 minutes did cook for 5 minutes covered then removed the foil for the last 10 minutes saving a half an hour in preparation time and they baked up beautifully. After husband s first bite I heard m-m-m-m-m and then \"...this is 5 stars \" and I totally agree. Don t forget that little bit of the butter mixture that you brush on top as I think it's really important to this recipe. I don t see why you couldn t prep these night before put in the fridge and then in the morning brush on the butter sauce and bake. Robin Wells thanks for sharing your recipe; it s a little decadent nutritionally but definitely a keeper and worth a splurge every now and then.",
