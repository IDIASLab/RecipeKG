Within minutes it is sooooo bitter!!  I was experimenting with two different recipes to see which one I wanted to use.  One had coconut milk, the other had sweetened condensed milk.  The first one was great.  The second was great.  When we went to sample the first one again to compare tastes, it was suddenly bitter.  So, we used the second recipe, thinking the first recipe wasn't as good.  I made a ton of it for our large family to be able to have several refills.  By the time we got everyone gathered and said the blessing- it was horribly bitter.  I thought the kids were being overly dramatic- saying it tasted bitter.  I poured a big glass, and when I tasted it, I was shocked!!! \nIt is out of consideration for you that I want you to know this is soooo good- but make it, drink it immediately.  THEN make more! :)  You're welcome!",
