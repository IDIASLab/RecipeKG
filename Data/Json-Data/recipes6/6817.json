As written, the recipe generates a dish in which the amounts of bacon and brown sugar seem way out of proportion to the amount of turnips. I think at least 6 (large-ish)turnips are needed. Also, when the brown sugar melts, it creates a lot of liquid. To compensate for this, it would be a good idea not to boil the turnips as long as you might if you were just making regular mashed turnips; you don't want the turnips to retain that much water. At the point where you stick a fork in the boiling turnips and think, \"Maybe a few more minutes,\" immediately take them off the stove. Finally, you can dispense with adding the bacon fat. You won't miss it.",
