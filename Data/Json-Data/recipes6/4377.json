I think the reviewer who said there was to much onion did not fully cook down their onions or used the giant sized onions at any rate it is onion soup after all and their rating isn't fair just based on that it is what it is! My changes to this recipe was that I used a beef stock that I had bought to use for another recipe that I didn't make. I also used a Gruy\u00e8re Cheese instead of mozzarella as I wanted the creamy nutty flavor that Gruy\u00e8re gives and for my company I thought it would make this soup that much more special. I also used a quality white wine that I already had for a quality flavor. Everyone commented on it's deep flavor and said it was the best they have ever had. I so recommend that anyone who wants a 5 star flavored onion soup give this one a try...I know they won't be disappointed.",
