When it's time to feed, it's time to discard some of the starter, and you may or may not be ready to bake bread. This recipe uses the starter that you discard to create a yummy coffee cake for those mornings when you have just a bit of extra time. I like to make the streusel first, so it's ready to go when I need it. There is also an optional glaze.",

I finally just went for it and I am so glad I did! This is delicious! The cake is so moist and the tpping sinks into the cake but leaves some crunch on the surface. I did not put the additional glaze on top. I don\u2019t feel the cake needed it and I was afraid it would make it soggy as I was serving it the next morning. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
