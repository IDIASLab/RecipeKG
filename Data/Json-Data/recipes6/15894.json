First of all I had to spread the cream cheese mixture with a knife because it wouldn't stick to the strawberry if I just dipped it. Second the sugar started melting and running right from the start. It looks a lot better and runs much less if you use colored sugar bought from the store as they are bigger crystals. Also make sure the strawberries are completely dry.",
