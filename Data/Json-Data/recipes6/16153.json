I do agree that they need to be cooked a bit longer closer to 12 minutes. The only adjustments I made was to omit the raisins and adding 2 TBSP of ground flax seed. I LOVE the flavor flax provides not to mention the added protein and other benefits. I think next time I will try to make a healthier version using more oats and applesauce instead of oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I believe it will become a family tradition in my home.",

The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. I had to keep them in the oven for at least 14 minutes. The two batches that were in for 12 minutes were more like muffin tops in texture which may be great if you want them like that. If you want a more cookie texture add baking time. The recipe was very tasty despite the muffin consitency and made my house smell great!",
