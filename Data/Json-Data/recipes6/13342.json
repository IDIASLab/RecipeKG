( I think it was teamed up with Dole Pineapple of Hawaii at the time) It was my Grandfather's favorite pie. The contest read Romance of Hawaii teamed up with mainland apples. We have enjoyed this dessert for many years in our family. Best made with medium green apples make sure to fan the apples out for a beautiful look. Nana would love for you to make it.:0)",
