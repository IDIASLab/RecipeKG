And I expected it to be really pretty, light brown with chocolate swirls, but it was instead a light brown with a darker brown bottom.  My husband ate it, but said it wasn't my best.

It adds just enough flavor so that you can taste it, but it's not overwhelming.  My only question with this recipe is that there was nothing said about a crust.  I used a store-bought chocolate oreo crust anyway and it was a perfect compliment.   I also used 16 oz of cream cheese (2 whole packages) because I thought \"HEY the more cream cheese the better!\".  But it made too much batter and wouldn't all fit into the crust.  Next time, I will just use the 12 oz.  Overall, a really great-tasting cheesecake!",
