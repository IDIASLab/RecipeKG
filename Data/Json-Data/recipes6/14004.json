While it did thicken up nicely, I think the texture was kind of funny. It was almost gummy. While it was warm it was good, but once it chilled I didn't like it as much. I subbed maple extract for the vanilla and got a maple pudding from this recipe. I think I'll try to stick with the egg type puddings, but thanks anyway.",
