Then I added the squash and garbanzo beans and simmered for 10 minutes.  This decreased the cooking time by almost half to prevent the veggies from becoming mushy.  However, the stew was far too spicy, to the point hubby and I weren't able to eat more than a few bites. (If served over rice like an Indian entree, this amount of spice might be acceptable.) Also, the texture of the squash seemed incompatible with the other ingredients and didn't seem to belong. Recipe sounded delicious but needs some big adjustments.",

Don't make the potato pieces too small or they break up - I like to have the texture of the potatoes so I'll remember to make them a little bigger next time. Also start with a potato masher on the garbanzo beans - it will speed things up and then you can use a fork on the ones the masher didn't get. The stew is quite spicy but my crowd seems to like it that way - serving over rice would probably help if you don't like this much spice.",

I also cut back on the curry and the cayenne pepper by about half and added one large clove of garlic that I chopped and saut\u00e9ed in butter then mixed in to the final pot.
