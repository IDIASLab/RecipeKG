You could MAKE this good by altering it a lot- less milk more flavor in the actual meat etc. It was refreshing to find a meatball recipe that didn't need to be fried. And where it said to stir STIR?? I don't think that was possible... you'd just break them apart! Overall I guess I'd say try another recipe first!: )",

That made me think mine were bigger than the original so I upped the cooking time to 30 minutes. They came out great. This has a nice flavor. I didn't even marinate them just made the sauce and poured straight on top. I served mine by spooning the meatballs into bowls and pouring a little sauce on top. That way you could roll the meatball around in the juice and give it really great flavor.",
