I jazzed it up quite a bit because I had heard the greens can taste bitter.  So I used grape tomato halves, tossed in some sweet fresh diced mango to complement any bitterness, added some toasted pinenuts, crumbled gorgonzola, & did a simple balsamic/olive oil dressing.  It was deLICious! Thanks, John!",

I love dandelion greens (they're not for everyone!) & simply adding the onions & tomatoes are more than enough to make a delicious salad. The dried basil is a nice touch and a great subtle flavor addition. I enjoyed this with my own simple balsamic vinaigrette dressing recipe & it hit the spot. If you want to help tone down the bitter flavor of the dandelion greens just soak them in some salted cold water for 5-10 minutes. Then drain & dry before making the salad. Thanks for sharing this recipe!:)",

Darn things are bitter. I know they're good for you - but you have to eat them to get the benefit of that goodness and I just can't. Sorry. At least I gave it one star - for the memories. My mom kept a basket and a knife in the trunk of the car and would stop and pick dandelions from farmers fields when she was out in the country - she thought they were a big prize!
