I made this as directed except for using just 1 cup of elbow macaroni. Makes a lot so I sent some to neighbors. When I took mine out to serve the next day I couldn't believe it. There was NO broth left. The macaroni had absorbed it ALL and I didn't even use the full amount of macaroni. I called my neighbors and they said they enjoyed the STEW - too late to send them over a can or two more of broth to add to it. This soup needs a minimum of 24oz. more of liquid - I would use vegetable broth.",

Last time I made it the liquid disappeared within an hour or two of taking the pot off of the stove. I mean it was totally gone--like a casserole or something. So here's what I changed this time: I used 3 potatoes 3 carrots 2 stalks of celery one quite-small onion 4 cloves garlic 16 oz of veggie broth 1-1/4 cups macaroni and dried herbs instead of fresh (same quantities). All the other ingredients were the same. I heated the olive oil and cooked the onion and garlic for maybe 5 minutes then added the rest of the chopped veggies and let them cook together for a few minutes. I think it tastes better that way. I had to cook longer than 30 minutes and the macaroni took longer than 10 minutes as well. There isn't a lot of liquid but it's much better than last time. If it disappears again I'll add more veggie broth. Using smaller quantities of vegetables makes a much more manageable-sized soup and I don't think we'll have to throw any away this time. It also tastes better when there's more liquid. With these modifications I really love this recipe! Thanks Corrigan!",
