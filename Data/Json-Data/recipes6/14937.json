The changes that I made to lower the fat and calorie contents were halving the sugar in both the cake and topping with Splenda and using 4 oz. pureed bananas (baby food) and 4 oz. canola oil for the fat. I toasted the chopped pecans at 350 for 6 mins. to develop their full flavor. Thanks Jackie for sharing this wonderful recipe!",
