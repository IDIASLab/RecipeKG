Despite these changes the cookies were still wonderful! The cookies looked raw after baking them 25 minutes, but I took them out anyway and put them on the cooling rack.  After about 15 minutes, they were crisp and still warm. My husband brought some to his friends at work and they loved them! I plan on doubling the recipe next time :)",

One thing I can say is that, with the butter and sugar I beat it very, very well to make sure I got a nice, fluffy cookie. A lot of choc chip cookie recipes will say to cream the butter and sugar but I beat the butter and sugar together within an inch of it's life. I also used salted butter and it was fine. I gave mine 15 minutes in the oven. The cookies are going to look like they aren't done when they first come out of the oven--they're fine! Just let them sit for a few minutes. Enjoy!",

I am going to share it with my friends who love shortbread cookies as well! I do want to add, I have a problem with others who critize the recipe saying they don't taste like chocolate chip cookies.  These are shortbread cookies with chocolate chips.  They won't taste like your typical chocolate chip cookie, they will taste like a shortbread cookie with a bite of chocolate chip and walnut.  A suggestion for those whose cookies turned out to have butter running out of them when baking, softened butter and not melted butter should be used when baking cookies, that may have been the problem.",
