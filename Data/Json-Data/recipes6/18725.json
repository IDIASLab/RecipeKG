It's a little time-consuming, because you have to use 3 bowls to mix everything together separately.  They ended up tasting pretty similar to my other ones.  I didn't have pine nuts, so I dropped in frozen blueberries and it was very good.  I used an electric griddle and cooked at 350.  I ended up having to put in a little extra milk.  Instead of 3/4 cup of white flour, I put in 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/4 cup of white.",
