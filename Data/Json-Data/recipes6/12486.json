I did a trial run last night after reading the reviews, and I'm very pleased (after making some changes).  One reviewer suggested using only 2 c. sugar and 3 eggs (thanks!) & that made it fit in the jar perfectly.  To cut down the \"all sugar\" look, I layered as follows:  flour mixture first, then 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, then the pecans.  It looked better that way.  I used cones I made from printer paper to fill the jar, and after each addition I tapped the jar on the counter to settle the ingredients.  When I mixed up the batch to bake, I did add a tsp. vanilla with the 3 eggs.  As someone else mentioned, it was a little dry, so I added another 1/4 c melted butter for a total of 1 cup.  Just right!!  My husband (who doesn't like sweets that much) had 3 in a row!  They were very moist and delish.  Thanks so much, now I have x-mas gifts!",

                "reviewBody": "Ok a few things. First the taste definitely gets 5 stars BUT only with the user recommended changes to the recipe. Those changes are as follows: use 1 c. melted butter 3 eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla(this requires you to change the info on the tag you print; trust me you want to do that i did a test run and they are sooooooooo good w/ the changes). Also for the ingrediants in the jar it's fine w/ only 2 c. sugar. OK second another major problem is getting everything to fit. I used 1 quart wide-mouth canning jars. You HAVE to pack down everything!!!! I found making my hand into a fist and using my knuckles and back of hand to pack down ingrediants works really well.Pack very tight!!! seriously.In this order Flour baking powder and salt PACK! then cocoa PACK! then wipe the inside of the jar with a dry paper towel(it gets pretty messy and will make the above sugar look dirty) then put the sugar (packing here helps only a little bit but still do it). Another reveiwer figured out a clever trick which i will reiterate here \"To cut down the \"all sugar\" look I layered as follows: flour mixture first then 1/3 c. cocoa 1 c. sugar 1/3 c. cocoa 1 c. sugar then the pecans.\" This works well and looks good but i ran out of time so just did the norm way and it looks fine. Ok by now there is very little room in the jar even with all that packing. So I basically improvised. I put about 1/4 c each of nuts and choc chips. You could do just one or the other but my point",

All my volunteers ended up using less sugar and JAMMING the nuts in last which didn't even fit quite as many as I would have liked. I have yet to taste the recipe but after all that work they better be good. Just disappointed. I thought they'd look nicer than they actually do maybe we did something wrong.",
