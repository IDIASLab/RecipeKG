I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt, for as an experienced baker, I know baked goods taste best with a bit of salt added.  Note however that I only baked the cake for 45 minutes in an oven calibrated to 350 degrees via my trusty oven thermometer.  I have found that substituting 1/4 cup of the butter with applesauce does not change the flavor or texture of the cake one iota, and does cut down the fat a smidge.  I also didn't put the topping on, as I don't like really sweet toppings.  A cream cheese frosting would be lovely.  I love this cake unfrosted -- a great and healthy snack cake, and a yummy breakfast alternative too.",

                "reviewBody": "I decided to try this recipe after apparently misplacing my usual family banana cupcake recipe. I cut this one in half and made 18 cupcakes and baked for about 15 minutes. It's a great basic banana cake recipe very fluffy although I guess it didn't \"wow\" me. I like that it uses sour cream instead of sour milk because I've always hated the pain of remembering to sour some milk with vinegar an hour before mixing. I skipped the topping and used plain chocolate frosting because I didn't have the topping ingredients on hand (and I'm not sure it would work with cupcakes...). This recipe DEFINTELY needs some salt which I planned to add on my own but forgot. Perhaps using salted peanuts in the topping would have made up for this though. It doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that a usual banana recipe with salt would have but that would be easily remedied with a teaspoon or so in the full batch. When I tried it plain it almost seems to have a baking soda aftertaste (maybe just a hint?) but with the frosting it was undetectable. Considering how light and fluffy these were I'd say it was just the right amount of soda and powder without being too much. The big plus which I consider to be the \"make it or break it\" for any cupcake recipe is that this cake came out of the \"wrappers\" (baking cups) very easily - no sticking.",

I don't think with fattening sour cream, that much more additional fat is needed to make a good cake.  Also, it's kinda weird to add so little sour cream alternately with flour - so I didn't. :)  'Added it to the bowl & gradually added the flour mixture. Added 1/2t salt & didn't do the topping.

I used pecans as some other users had noted and found that the pecans kinda burnt not bad but a bit. Neither the chocolate chips nor the sugar melted and I even covered it with foil in the last 20 minutes to prevent it from burning. If I make this again I'll put the choco chips IN the batter and add some butter to the topping and cut it like you would the topping for an apple crisp. I also used 8 bananas and used coconut oil instead of margarine or butter. I used yogourt instead of sour cream and cut down on the sugar. The cake was perfect!!! The topping was a little off all in all still a crowd pleaser.",
