Because i followed the recipe exactly and the cake is not so much a cake as a really dense doughy bread...and after having perused all the other hummingbird recipes they all say soda and not powder.  Haven't tasted it yet but just on texture alone, i'm a more than a little disappointed to say the least.  I did notice that others said it was a dense cake but i didin't think that it was going to be anything like what i got.   I've had hummingbird cake before and it was fabulous...this not so much",

Once as per recipe and the second time attempting to copy the one a small local deli serves.To bring this recipe more in line with that of the deli, I chopped half the bananas and mashed half and added 1/2t banana extract for a more enhanced banana flavor. I cut the oil to one cup and didn't drain the crushed pineapple; added 1/4t of cloves and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and toasted the pecans. I used your cream cheese frosting, but toasted extra pecans, chopped small and gently pushed them into the frosting all over the cake.The result was fabulous. I'm continually being asked for the recipe.",

I substituted eggbeaters for eggs & splenda for sugar. The result was a very dense but absolutely DELICIOUS cake. Very very sweet so best with a cup of coffee or even coffee ice cream - to tame the sweetness. I made this as a layer cake (2 9 inch cakes). I layered smooshed banana & crushed pineapple as the in-between layer. Very very good to get that punch of flavor but be sure to thoroughly dry the crushed pineapple otherwise it gets kinda leaky. I cooked the cake at 325 in a confectioner's oven for 45 minutes. I watched it very very closely to ensure it did not burn. I topped with toasted coconut. My dad could not stop raving. Thank you.",

I will have to experiment with frostings but the cake is really lovely. Oh and I will only make it with the applesauce next time b/c it doesn't seem to change the texture or flavor noticeably.",

I made no changes to the ingredients themselves but I did cook this in 4 eight inch round pans to make 4 thin layers (about 1 3/4 c batter per pan). I used the same cook time and it was perfect. I also made an extra half serving of the icing so it would be easy to decorate - but the cake stands up on its own extra icing is definitely not necessary! I did not mix the pecans in the icing but used them for decoration. Great recipe! I'll be making this regularly in the future.",
