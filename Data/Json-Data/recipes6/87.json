Best bet was making small patties then using a cookie cutter- we followed directions exactly!!!- after the baking was done we had a super hard, super sweet, super sweet smelling biscuit that actually was good for dipping in tea and not much else. Very disappointing. Wonder where we went wrong?",

Roll out between parchment paper with a little powdered sugar to keep from sticking.  Lastly, freeze cut-out cookies for ~15 mins before baking to help retain the shape.  I really, really like this recipe and the versatility it seems to provide, as seen in the other comments.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!",
