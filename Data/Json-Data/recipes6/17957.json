I'm not a whipped cream person so I used powdered sugar but the kids had a blast spritzing with the canned chocolate whipped cream. (by the way I also thinned the batter) And Nan:) LOVED your idea using the nutella. Nutella rocks and I know that my younger daughter and hubby would love it coupled with bananas!",

They tasted good (the crepes themselves) but could add extra sugar or vanilla to batter.  Melted chocolate works well, syrup or nutella would work too as others said.  Cool whip was fine for us :-)  \r\n\r\nThey take 10 minutes and make a great dessert.  Batter could be used for any crepes.  Btw, nutella and bananas is a crepe served by a breakfast restaurant called Cora's - it's DELICIOUS :-)",
