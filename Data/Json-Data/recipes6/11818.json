So basically what you're doing is making cinnamon rolls but instead of leaving them as rolls you smash each roll into a large flat circle sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and bake like a cookie. A few notes about the recipe: 1. When it says a \"lightly floured surface\" - read that to mean dump at least 1/2 cup of flour on there because this dough is so sticky. I had to knead a lot more flour into it to make it work at all. 2. I found it easier to just smash the rolls into circles with my hands rather than using a rolling pin (and faster too). 3. MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL.....The whole bit about ungreased cookie sheets - DON'T do it. Use parchment paper. Seriously. I could barely chisel some of these off and one of my cookie sheets will never be the same. 4. Mine were done in 10 minutes. Altogether a very tasty treat that my children are already begging for me to bake again.",
