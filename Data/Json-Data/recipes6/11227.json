The cake was very moist and fluffy - not at all dense or dry as in the previous review, and it rose perfectly (perhaps the problem with previous reviews saying thiers had fallen in the middle was old baking powder?).  I followed the recipe and instructions exactly (except I substituted butter for the shortening because I didn't have any), and didn't even use a water bath and it was still incredibly moist!  It was perfect with Tianne's Chocolote Frosting I.  Definitely a recipe that I will use over and over!",

This was my husband's first attempt at making cake from scratch (LOVES cake and has  made box cakes until  now).We substituted butter for shortening and about a 1/2 c or so of the flour was whole wheat (will increase to 1 c next time), baked in 2 round pans for 33 min(one to eat, one to freeze). We both went back for seconds (OK, I had thirds). Oh, and that was with no frosting! Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: made it again and it turned out even better. We mixed it a lot more this time and it baked up very light. This makes me wonder if people who have gotten really dense cakes have not mixed long enough to incorporate some air into the batter before baking?? Bottom line - wonderful to have a recipe from scratch that tastes this good. Many thanks!",

I have some recommendations though which might help some of the others who weren't as happy with it as me. 1) I bake this cake in a water bath - place tin on cookie sheet (or other tin with high sides); fill larger tin with boiling water while baking. This ensures an extremely moist cake. 2) Line tin with parchment paper and grease with shortening - this definitely allows it to come out clean from the tin. 3) I like to add almond extract with the vanilla for a really nice subtle flavour. I've also frosted this with a vanilla (store bought) frosting and added ground almonds with sugar between layers or on top. Thanks very much for this recipe - definitely a keeper for me:o)",

I doubled it and made an American Flag cake with it (with blueberry stars and strawberry stripes) for a birthday treat (my b-day is close to the 4th of July) - and there were 50 happy people at work!  I did follow other's advice and cut the baking powder to 2 tsp and used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, plus I separated the eggs.  I whisked the egg whites and added a bit at a time, then mixed the yolks with the milk and alternated it with the flour mixture, which I sifted.  It turned out light and fluffy and moist!
