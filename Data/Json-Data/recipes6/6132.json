It was my first marzipan recipe I ever tried so it was a disappointment to find out it did not work.. but there is a good thing! I made a few adjustments to make the recipe how marzipan should be. To do this I added one 198g container of Jet Puffed Marshmallow fluff and a few more cups of icing sugar. I kneaded it only a few times and it ended up turning out very well. I hope you can do the same and have your marzipan to turn out too. The consistancy should be simular to pie dough Good Luck!:)",

The only thing I did was convert the 3 cups confection sugar to ounces and then weighed the sugar. In addition I used my paddle hook on my KitchenAide mixer to knead the dough. As to the recipe being to soft or not setting... that is either a not enough dry ingredient or too much wet. This recipe doesn't say what size egg to use for the egg whites. The larger the eggs the more white so maybe the eggs need to be just large or medium in size.",
