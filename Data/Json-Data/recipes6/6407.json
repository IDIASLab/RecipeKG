I thought the cayenne was unnecessary and would make the dish entirely too spicy but he said it was not and it had the perfect blend of spiciness. The one change I would make is to use dark meat chicken cooked in water which would benefit in a couple of different ways. Dark meat is cheaper than white and water is free. The dark meat is more  flavorful and moist  which would most definitely improve the end result.  As written, the broth is lost and the chicken is still dry.  As directed the celery stays very crunchy (we personally like it this way) but if crunch bothers you then you will need to sweat it down a lot longer than the recipe calls for.  Great recipe and worth a try if wings are your thing!",

I added sharp cheese on top of the mozzarella & cooked the onions & celery until they were no longer crunchy. Just my personal preference. Everyone loved it that tried it my picky best friend even asked me for the recipe. It was in no way very spicy though so if you do decide you like things spicier just add more Buffalo wing sauce.

Made it totally from scratch even the hot wing sauce and the blue cheese dressing (see Blue Cheese Dressing by Nancy Blair--used the whole recipe plus 2 eggs and left out ricotta ). Ground up the boiled breasts in a food processor first and added it to the well-cooked celery and onion ALL the hot wing sauce (1/3 c sriracha sauce 1/3 cup melted butter) 1 cup blue cheese plus about 1 cup chicken stock to make it moist. Didn't use mozzarella at all just topped it with a mix of colby and pepper jack. Skipped the cayenne as suggested. Seriously yummy!",
