I run the Lionel Richie Fan Club and wanted to send some to Lionel for his birthday and there it was. I didn't need to cut the snickers in half. I did use the very small bite size snickers though. One thing I learned really quick though was to leave them alone for a little bit after removing them from the oven. When I tried to remove them too early they fell apart. But if I let them sit and cool right on the cookie sheet for awhile they slid right off and were perfect to finish cooling on cookie rack! Thanks for the great recipe!",

Since I can't rate b/t the 2 I have to go with my opinion and give 3 's. On the contrary my friends & co-workers would probably rate these a 4 or 5. The \"wow\" factor just isn't there for me. B/c I'm giving these as gifts it's all about presentation. I was hoping for a round (ball) cookie w/ a firm texture (not crumbly just firmer than what these were). My cookeis were flat and not pretty at all (but I guess they're supposed to be that way...). I clipped a recipe for these exact cookies back in 2002. It was in the Saturday paper's coupon section (a Snicker's ad). The only difference b/t this recipe and that one is the amount of flour called for and how the two bake. The ad recipe calls for more flour (3 1/2 c.). I think that is why the cookies pictured in the ad look different. NOTE: I followed the cooking directions (and the rolling in sugar step) from my clipped recipe but used the measurements as per this one. I formed tablespoonfuls of dough around each Snicker's miniature rolled in (granulated) sugar spaced 2 in. apart on my greased cookie sheets and baked at 325 degrees for 15 minutes. My final verdict? These taste good but won't be included on my cookie trays. Thanks anyways Carole!:-)",

The second time I only put in 1 cup of flour so they spread all over the cookie sheet and ran into eachother but they tasted good.
