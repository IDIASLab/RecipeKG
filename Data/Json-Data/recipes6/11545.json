I am a pastry chef & am very fussy about my cakes, and I will be using this one again.  Great cake!",

Before my husband could finish his second piece, he told me to make another tonight. I tweaked this recipe some for our family taste buds:I added extra 1/2 tsp vanilla, decreased nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, after creaming butter and sugar.,I added one egg at a time, then added two cups of hot mashed sweet potatoes, followed by flour mixture, lastly I added vanilla. Only baked for 35-40 minutes. Baked in Bundt cake pan.Wonderful golden/orange color. Immediately inverted to cake plate to cool.Cake was so good, I didn't even bother to make orange confection glaze. Cake was moist, dense, but not heavy like a brick. This cake could pass as a soft sweet potato loaf depending on what you bake it in. Again, fantastic recipe. Highly Recommended. This recipe is a keeper. Enjoy!",
