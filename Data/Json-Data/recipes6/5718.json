We don't use cumin because of food allergies with some family members and my family doesn't like black beans so I used pinto beans instead and I use 3 T. dehydrated cilantro, 2 tsp. minced garlic(1 for meatballs-1 for tomatoes sauce) plus 2 tsp. shallots divided the same way. I used chopped green chile tomatoes that I ran through the blender for a sauce to put them in after I cooked them and then place in the crock pot to keep it warm. My family and friends most have liked them because none were left that evening.",
