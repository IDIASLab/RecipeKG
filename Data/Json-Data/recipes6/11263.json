Directions say to pour the batter was thick like brownies it was more like spread in the pan. Baked and let cool for a bit then taste test time. You do end up with a pool of coffee flavored chocolate in the bottom of the pan. I spooned it out hubby ate half. He liked it enough I caught him sneaking some into a container to take to work for lunch. I thought the cake a bit dry and crumbly but with the syrupy liquid it offsets the dryness. I think a little more milk in the mix would fix the crumbly part. It definitely has a mocha/coffee flavor. Thanks for the recipe.",

Will make again and again.",
