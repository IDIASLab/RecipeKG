The beauty of this recipe is that every ingredient is one measure, which makes it easy to remember.  Everybody from the great-grandparents to fraternity brothers have loved this one.  I prefer Bourbon, but any whiskey, rum, brandy could be substituted.  (If you use vodka, please don't tell me!)  The old folks claimed the original recipe called for a Quart of Whiskey, but a pint is perfect.",
