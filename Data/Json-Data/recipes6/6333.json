        "description": "When the going gets tough, the tough make soup! There are certain recipes that comfort the body and soul in a profound way and this hearty potato and sausage soup is in that class. I think you'll agree it's one of the best things you've had in a long time. The savory flavor from smoked sausage and the earthy sweetness from onions and cabbage are balanced perfectly with a splash of vinegar and a bit of sour cream, all brought together by soft and tender potatoes--the only way this gets better is serving it with a nice hunk of buttered, crusty bread.",

I substituted apple cider vinegar for plain distilled vinegar, and andouille sausage for Hungarian sausage since it was all I had on hand. I added Hungarian Peppers since I had some in the fridge. I also eyeballed everything from memory because my internet wasn\u2019t working at the time so I couldn\u2019t pull the recipe up. Inspite of all that, it was absolutely delicious! The vinegar at the end and the sour cream garnish really add something remarkable to this dish - do not skip them. Thank you Chef John for a delicious and foolproof recipe!",
