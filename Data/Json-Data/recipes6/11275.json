THE CAKE TASTES GREAT THOUGH BUT NOW THAT IT IS IN PIECES WE WILL EAT IT WITH ICECREAM AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE IN A BOWL NO PRETTY PIECES HERE. DEFINITELY WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN BUT IN THE \"TUBE/ANGEL FOOD\" PAN. I ADDED A SPINKLING OF INSTANT COFFEE POWDER TOO FOR A MORE MOCHA TASTE. BARBARA IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO GET IT OUT OF THE BUNDT PAN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT CAUSE IT WOULD LOOK PRETTY OUT OF THE DECORATIVE BUNDT PAN.

I baked it for the hour but I think that was too long for it was started to burn on the bottom. Although it says cook for 1 hour or until cake springs back....I didn't think I needed to check it 15 minutes before. So it was overcooked and a bit dry. According the review before mine...they had problems using a Bundt Pan. For me it fell right out. Considering this cake had very little fat....just no stick spray on my Bundt pan worked great. I'd like to try this recipe again and see how fares with less cooking time.",

It is kinda dry and it was not easy to fold the egg whites in as the egg yolk chocolate almond meal was very very dry drier than peanut butter consistency. I would put a little more sugar as well Maybe using almond meal/flour ( storebought) caused me to put more than intended. ( as the home ground one would naturally be more fluffier)",

(1) I used 8 eggs (room temperature) instead of 10 and did not separate; beat for 15 minutes with 1-1/2 cups sugar. (2) Instead of almond used 1 cup cake meal with 2 tablespoons tapioca starch/flour. (3) Rather than making a chocolate cake poured 3/4 batter into very well greased and floured (used cocoa powder) bundt pan then added melted chocolate to remaining batter and swirled (though recipe works same if you want it chocolate). (4) Baked for exactly 50 minutes cooled for 10 than inverted onto cake plate. (5) Cooled fully then can either use powdered sugar or as I did add a ganache topping. Made twice and nothing but rave reviews! Keeps well out in air tight container for a few days so you can make a day (or two) in advance and it holds up.",

The yolk/chocolate/almond mixture was like peanut butter which made me feel like the fold was more of a stir but it worked out with a nice rise and texture. I will definitely grease and flour the pan before baking the next time. Because the cake stuck to the pan I broke up the cake and layered it with fresh whipped cream and berries in a glass bowl. This was still a pretty presentation and enjoyed by all.",
