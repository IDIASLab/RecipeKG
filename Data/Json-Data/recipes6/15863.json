Did not use the amount of sugar called for--kind of chickened out for fear that it would be sweet but it is not--it adds a subtle quality that makes for great eating. Also used fresh basil doubled the quantity did not have garlic salt so I used powder and regular salt--all of these details doesn't change the overall effect of the dish. Shows well the sugar glazing adds a golden appearance. Very much recommend this. You can tell it is written by someone that understands that salmon needs only augmentation and this treatment does just that.",
