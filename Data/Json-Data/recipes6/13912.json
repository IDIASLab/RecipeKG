My hubby doesn't care for strawberry's but will eat this salad without a problem so will my 2 y/o. I've also added some chopped avocado or left out the mushrooms if I didn't have any....still a great salad! It's fine with just romaine lettuce and instead of chopped pecans (yummy) I find myself tossing in a handful of sunflower seed for a change also. I prefer the dressing at room temperature and I think it thickens up bit this way also. My alsolute favorite salad and it's converting alot of friends and family to salad eating too!",

I used slightly less than 3/4 cup of vegetable oil all of the sugar (I first tried it with less and added in the rest as we liked it sweeter) deleted the poppy seeds and mushrooms toasted the pecans and added crumbled feta cheese. The strawberries were just perfect I used my Pampered Chef egg slicer to make perfect slices after I capped them and although I used mixed greens I think just using spinach would have made a prettier presentation. Thank you Leslie for the awesome post! We served this with \"Perfect Baked Potato\" and \"Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks\" from this site. Yum!",
