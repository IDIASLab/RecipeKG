I HIGHLY recommend the icing she uses:  1 stick melted butter or margarine, 16 oz. box of powdered sugar, 1 mashed banana, 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Cream butter until fluffy, gradually add powdered sugar, and beat well.  Beat in mashed banana.  Stir in pecans.  WOW!  The cake looks so impressive with pecan halves pressed on the top outer layer, too.  Thanks for the recipe!",

In fact it's kind of curdly which concerned me from the get-go. After it baked I was disappointed in how thin the layers were and at this point I gave serious consideration to cutting my losses and not bothering to frost it as it was not going to be the tall magnificent layer cake that I had envisioned. Removing the layers from the pans and finding them sticky only made matters worse. Even so I decided to go ahead with the frosting plans. One taste of this and everything I had assumed I'd be negatively saying about this recipe went right out the window. It is super moist almost too moist but rather that than too dry. And simply packed with banana flavor this cake is really decadently delicious. So why only four stars? I still believe something is off here. The cake is so moist it makes for a texture that simply doesn't look right. And had I known the layers would be SO thin I'd have made 1-1/2 times the recipe and still baked it in 2-9\" round layer cake pans. Not as attractive a cake as I had hoped for but certainly as big on taste as I had hoped for. I chose not to use the nuts but except for that I strictly stuck to the recipe. These thin layers were baked in 23 minutes so watch baking time carefully.",

I baked for approximately 20 minutes at 350 and the cupcakes were very dark on the top and didn't rise very much. All of my ingredients were fresh (except for the slightly overripe bananas) so I know it wasn't that. I didn't overbeat so it wasn't that either. The egg whites were folded in gently so eliminate that as well. I do know that 1 1/2 cups of sugar to only 1/2 cup of butter is not the right ratio. The mixture didn't cream properly; it stayed somewhat dry and crumbly even after beating on high on my kitchenaid for about 5 minutes. The cupcakes weren't at all cakelike; they were chewy and greasy (it even soaked through the paper liners to the pans). Maybe this recipe is good when baked in a 9\" round but not as cupcakes. I'm really sorry but I'll be sticking with my favorite banana nut muffin recipe when I have bananas \"on the edge\"!",
