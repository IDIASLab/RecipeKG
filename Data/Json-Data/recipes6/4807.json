They were so impressed as well I had to share the recipe on the spot. So few ingredients and so simple makes it a fantastic weeknight busy family dinner. My husband and kids LOVED it and came back for seconds! I followed the recipe exactly as written but am looking forward to trying new versions in the future (ie. broccoli chicken mini- meatballs red pepper). Yum!",

By the time the dish was done most of the water had evaporated and I was left with a nice thick sauce. Bf loved it! Sauce was delicious and reminded me of cream-of-mushroom soup:)",
