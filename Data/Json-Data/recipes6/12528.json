I used all dark brown sugar almond instead of vanilla extract and a bit extra baking soda. I made drop cookies instead of rolling & slicing the dough and was rewarded with these DELICIOUS soft little puffs. Ready in 15 minutes all together. I'm so excited that this recipe worked even with my TFA-free substitution it will become a staple in my house. I will have to buy the next size up in jeans now!",

Not heavy but definitely not light and airy; a pretty dense cookie. They aren t crispy but not soft and chewy either. Toothsome I guess? Phenomenal flavor. I made them with M&Ms in them and they are fabulous! The first batch I cooked a bit more (at least 11 minutes). The second batch I cooked for 10. Very different textures actually. The second tasted much more buttery. Both were excellent just different. I would definitely make these again and I will definitely continue to put some extra goodies in them. I chilled the dough in the freezer and would do that again. Fabulous recipe.",

I tryed both the original and the oatmeal coconut. I gave the original a 5 but I would give the coconut oatmeal a 3 the flavor was wonderful but no matter how thick I made the shapes the cookies still turned out to be just over 1/8 inch thick after baking when the original was just between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick which was great! I guess it could have been that batch because i used imperial margarine instead of butter so I am not completely sure.",

I increased the vanilla and added some cinnamon for a little kick. I was unable to roll the dough out like the directions said it was way too sticky. But that was probably because I didn't use the shortening. I placed it in freezer tight tubs instead and grabbed chunks of the dough and rolled it into a ball. I will definitely try the different variations. My first sugar cookie recipe is going to be my last!!!",
