Other wise the rest of the ingredients are exactly the same. What we've always done is this, we bake it in a jelly roll pan, which is about 10.5 by 15.5 inches, a little larger than a 9x13 pan. Also we don't even try to cover the top of the cherrie pie filling completely, but spread the remaining batter around in a sort of blotchy, swirly pattern so that some cherries are covered and some aren't.  The batter spreads even more as the bars bake. Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes. Then we sprinkle on powdered sugar after the cake has cooled. Makes a very pretty and tasty cake dessert.",

After discovering that I made it again only in the cookie sheet I normally use for bars. Way better not mushy after 40 minutes and definately a BAR. The topping doesn't cover well at all however next time I may increase the recipe just a little to have more for the top. I also sprinkled powdered sugar over the top after baking it looked amazing all white and red perfect for the holidays! Yummy!",

I used three egg yolks I had left over from another recipe as a replacement for one egg and had to add a little milk to compensate for Arizona dryness. (The flour dries out horribly here). I think it's going to taste good what with a cup of butter vanilla and lots of eggs. A can of pie filling was PLENTY. It took about an hour to cook. I think it should be re-named as it is a cake. I love that this is a no-chocolate non-cheesecake cherry idea. I may try reducing the sugar next time. Thanks for the recipe!",

As suggested before I used an 11x15 jellyroll pan so that it was more bar-like. It worked fine; however one can of cherry pie filling was a stretch although two cans would be too much. The taste is a subtly sweet cherry bar/cake. The kids liked it. I would suggest sprinkling about 1 tbsp of sugar over the bars just prior to baking. Also I wonder how almond extract would taste in place of the vanilla.",
