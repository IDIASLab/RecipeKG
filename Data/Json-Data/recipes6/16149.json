I used 1 can of apple pie filling and cut up 3 white peaches to add to it; I also subbed vanilla yogurt for the sour cream 'cuz that's what I had on hand. By only using one can of filling and some fresh fruit this was very tasty without being too sweet. I also like how easy the crust is to make. I used a 10x10 casserole dish for this so the topping was a thin layer. Next time I'll use a deeper dish so that the cream layer is thicker. This set up very well but you definitely have to chill for a few hours after it cools before serving. The kids loved this with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream.",

I feel the crust should be halved for the amount of filling, but that may be because I used fresh fruit instead of pie filling- I don\u2019t like commercial pie fillings. The first time I used melted coconut oil for the crust and mixed sliced kiwi and cranberries into the sour cream mixture, with some tapioca starch to thicken the fruit. It was still too wet and the crust too thick. This time I doubled the sour cream filling, stirred in blueberries mixed with tapioca starch, used melted butter for the oil in the crust, and cooked the crust for 5 minutes before filling it. It took almost 2 hours to get to the slightly giggly stage. Next time I will halve the crust recipe and the filling recipe as is. It helped to precook the crust for firmness on the bottom. Thanks for this easy, not too sweet recipe.",
