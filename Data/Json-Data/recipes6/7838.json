This was my first time cooking buckwheat and we really enjoyed it.  We served it as a side dish with grilled salmon.  We had some left-over so the next day I added some chopped artichoke bottoms and a bit more fresh mint to perk it up and it was still great !  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It is a keeper.",

Because I like a little more protein and a little more freshness, I also added 1/2 of a 14.5 oz can of garbanzo beans and half of an English cucumber(diced). I did not expect the lime juice, mint, dill and cumin to taste so delicious!? this is a keeper and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!?",
