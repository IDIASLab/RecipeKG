Did not have a crust and no time to make one so I doubled the recipe using 2 cans of canned milk and reg milk to make the 4 cups. I then used a 9 x 13  cake pan as a bath and a glass pan that fit inside. Glass pan inside the 9 x 13, poured the custard into the glass pan into the oven then added water to the outside pan almost to the top. Baked for 30 minutes @ 350. Came out perfect. Made it again tonight and it is perfect.",
