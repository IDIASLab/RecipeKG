I proofed the yeast with the warm water/milk and the three tablespoons sugar for ten minutes then added the melted butter salt and the flours. I did need a touch more flour to get the dough to form a firm enough ball to jump on the bread hook. I kneaded the dough for five minutes with the bread hook then set it to rise for an hour in a covered greased bowl. I formed the dough into 1/3 cup bread balls and plopped them into greased muffin tins covered them with plastic wrap and let them double again. Baked at 400 these rolls were done at 12 minutes. I did NOT brush the rolls with the melted butter until they came out of the oven. This is a decent wheat roll recipe. It's just sweet enough without going overboard but it's a little lacking in flavor. For me a wheat roll is much better when using honey for a sweetener or when there's an egg added. I don't know that I'd make this roll recipe again.",
