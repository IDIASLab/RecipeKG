I used 1 cup zucchini 1 cup broccoli and cup yellow onion in favor of using the red bell pepper. Chef John said to use any veggie of your choice. I omitted the jalapeno pepper because I didn t want it to be too spicy hot for my guests. I doubled the sauce except I decreased the chili paste to 1 Tbsp and the brown sugar to just 1Tbsp. I served it over steamed brown rice and it was an incredible meal. Everyone loved it. Thanks Chef John!!! Beer (Bud Coors or Miller) always works as a nice substitute for white wine in any recipe. Even 1 Tbsp brown sugar is almost too sweet for this recipe. I recommend using less brown sugar unless you love the sweetness of Orange Chicken and Sesame Chicken entr\u00e9es.",
