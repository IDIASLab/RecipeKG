Some people comment it is too sweet but not for my family we tend to like sweet. There is one ingredient I do like to add to various hamburger related recipes that adds vegetables and stretches the recipe and that is the Bellaire brand Southwest Vegetable mix. For those of you not familiar it is a combination of chopped green peppers onions black beans and corn. It is located in the frozen vegetable section of the grocery store. Costco has small pretzel buns that go perfect with sloppy Joes.",
