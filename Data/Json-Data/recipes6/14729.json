Also, as with any quick bread or cake, MAKE SURE you cream your butter and sugar well (i.e. a minimum of 4-5 minutes) and that all your ingredients are room temperature to ensure even baking.\n1.  I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 15 minutes and added this mixture after adding the flour/baking soda.\n2.  I read the other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. (although I didn't think they were too sweet before - I just like really sweet cornbread).\n3.  Again, off the other reviews, I added about 3/4 of a can of kernel corn, drained, instead of frozen (the frozen was a bit chewy).\n4.  Instead of upping the milk, I stirred in 1/4 c of sour cream before the kernel corn.  Made a nice texture difference.",

I could of easily served this with strawberries and whipcream for the perfect \"strawberry shortcake\" concept. I decided to make this recipe again the following day with some changes and made it in the traditional style regular pan. I reduced the honey to 1/8 cup. Sugar 1/2 cup. salt 3/4 tspn. cornmeal 3/4 cup 1/8 cup more. baking powder 3/4 tspn. milk 1/2 cup 1/8 cup more. I also put the corn in the food processor for a two or three times quick pulse spins. Everything else in recipe is ok to me. I found that this was much better for regular cornbread and still plenty sweet without going overboard. I enjoyed this batch much better than the first one. If approved by my supervisor at my job I will bring her a sample of the revised recipe today and hopefully use this as as our go-to recipe at the hospital where I work as a baker. I think our customers would enjoy this.",
