Liked this a lot...mouth is telling me another story as I decided to only try a 1/3 of the recipe before making the whole recipe and using all of the ingredients. Now I was assuming that the Hawaiian Sweet Bread was the rolls. But I'm thinking I may or may not be correct. Of course the rolls are smaller so one slice of SPAM was cut in half and placed on a roll portion and I actually put 2 pieces of pan fried pineapple on top of each SPAM portion what I really should have done was not drizzle as much Sriracha onto each portion......hmmmm WOOOO while good I had to grab a large glass of milk and made it through just fine HA! But otherwise...liked it",
