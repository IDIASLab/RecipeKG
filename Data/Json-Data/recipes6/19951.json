They turned out really well and I'm enjoying them for breakfasts in the morning. I found they stuck to the muffin cups when they were hot, but once they cooled I had no problem. They also froze pretty well. A keeper for sure!",

I haven't made a muffin that used olive oil before but it worked great.  I used brown sugar instead of white and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used 1 tsp of cinnamon.  If you cut the strawberries up small they should cook fine and get rid of the sogginess.  Mine weren't soggy at all.  Very nice, different muffin.",

As others suggested I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead and added a handful of walnuts (makes them so much better!). I also substituted the olive oil with vanilla yogurt. The result is definitely very healthy and tasty! Like others I also couldn't taste a strong strawberry flavour. I think next time I'll try it with strawberry yogurt and add a little bit more sugar.

I only made these as listed a couple of times and then I started playing with the recipe to make other kinds of muffins which all turned out spectacular. This is one of my favorite recipes to modify because it generally comes out well. Both times I have used whole wheat cake flour and the whole wheat really seems to enhance the flavor so I would suggest trying whole wheat instead of regular flour and if you're not a big fan of berries you could try adding golden raisins and walnuts. Someone else mentioned a problem with tasting olive oil but i did not have this problem. I use the lightest olive oil I can find in the store or I use high heat safflower oil.",
