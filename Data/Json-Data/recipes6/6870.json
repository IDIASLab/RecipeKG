Plus it was quick and easy to put together - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I cut back on the number of servings and used some leftover grilled chicken that I tossed in some Frank's Red Hot, a little melted butter and a mix of seasonings for our homemade hot wing sauce. I also used \"No-Mayonnaise Ranch Dressing\" from this site vs. bottled ranch dressing. I added some lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese along with the tomatoes. My husband and I loved the addition of the bacon in the wrap!",

I used less chicken (because I was making less wraps) which I pre-cooked and shredded into the sauce that I doubled (I melted the butter in a pan and added Frank's Red Hot (instead of the wing sauce) and some garlic powder). Along with the tomatoes bacon and ranch I also added lettuce onions and cheese...SO GOOD! These will definately be made A LOT in our house! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I used the basic Buffalo Wing sauce from the Frank's Hot Sauce website, whole wheat tortillas and my own homemade low-calorie ranch dressing. I did add in shredded lettuce as well. HUGE hit with my husband. He ate four and the one of mine I didn't finish, he ate as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe--I can say for sure that I will be making these a lot for him.",

                "reviewBody": "I'm the one who submitted this recipe 2 years ago. And nope it's not healthy at all. But that being said there are a few things you can do to make it a little less fat and cholesterol filled. Here is what I've changed since submitting this recipe. First I cook the bacon in the oven drain in paper towels and then crumble. (How much is up to you.) Then I cook the chicken pieces in a little olive oil and add the sauce (as much or little as you would prefer it's up to you). As for the dressing you can either use blue cheese or ranch or skip it all together if you'd like. I make homemade ranch because that's what my family likes and I know what ingredients are going in it. Bottled blue cheese always tastes metalic to me and I haven't tried making homemade blue cheese dressing yet. Besides my family isn't crazy about blue cheese dressing although I do like it myself but not the bottled stuff. So there are many ways to make these wraps to your liking by adding subtracting or changing whatever you wish. Is it healthy? No but that's why we don't eat it every week. By the way thanks for your comment Belveal and I am happy to see most everyone is enjoying this dish as much as we do.",
