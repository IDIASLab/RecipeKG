I can only imagine why people thought they tasted like flour, look at the recipe's stated proportion of flour to cream cheese!  3 oz. cream cheese for 2 1/2 cups flour?  YIKES.  I made this recipe with 8 oz. cream cheese and cut back the flour to 2 cups, and still think I could cut the flour back some more. They don't taste too rich with the 8 oz,. trust me, it will taste the way its supposed to...like a CREAM CHEESE COOKIE and not a flour cookie!  For half my batch I pressed a fork into the cookies and sprinkled green sugar crystals on them, the other half I made thumbprints and filled with blackberry and apricot preserves.  Yummy.  Food coloring also works great with these cookies, especially if using a press!",

After making it as submitted several times today I managed to create \"strawberry cheesecake\" cookies by adding 2/3 of a 3 oz box of strawberry jello. (I was too chicken to add the whole box but I might next time). This made the cookies a bright pink color which was perfect for my daughter's class Valentine's party tomorrow. I also used a full 8 oz of cream cheese this time and was pleased with the results. I chilled the dough and then put it into my cookie press to make a heart shape. My husband said he loved them and wants me to do it this way again next time. Imagine the possibilities...green jello mix with a shamrock shape for St. Pat's Day or Christmas trees orange jello for Halloween pumpkins... This recipe works so well for press cookies. I tried two or three other recipes with horrible results and now I always use this one. Good luck!",

This time I added 8 oz. cream cheese and did them as a drop cookie because the dough was too sticky for a press. They are MUCH better this time. Soft cookies with a lot of cream cheese flavor!! I added chocolate chips to some and I made thumbprint cookies out of some. I put a bit of strawberry preserves in the tumbprint before baking. YUMMY! The plain ones are good as well! I will probably make these again. I gave it 4 stars because I had to alter the recipe.",
