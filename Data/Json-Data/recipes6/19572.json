I decided to try ELLIEGIRL1's tips of using Nori (roasted seaweed) instead of spinach (as I have done in the past),and grated fresh ginger (I grated it into the cooled rice). These two ingredients put this recipe clear over the TOP and then some (Wish I could give it more stars)!  TY TY TY for posting the Nori use! For a potluck dish that has to travel, a dish you want to make several hours ahead, or a salad that has to wait awhile to be served we still nix the lettuce. Nori and Wasabi paste can be found in the ethnic area of most grocery stores. \n\nOriginal review-\nA TOTAL POTLUCK HIT !! WOW! If you like traditional California Roll sushi you will love this for a change! I have made this several times, but have evolved to totally nixing the lettuce as it tends to get way too limp for our taste! Now, it's just rice, avocado, fake crab, cuke, and I add steamed spinach. Amounts are too your taste.  I make the dressing exactly as directed. I now use this dressing on fish, and numerous other things. IT'S THE BEST! I will make this again and again.",

Was I pleasantly surprised it tasted like the real thing without the time consuming work of making and slicing the rolls easy and delicious! I used romaine lettuce so I didn t have a problem with soggy lettuce or maybe it was because we finished the salad before the lettuce had time to wilt. I used wasabi paste and tried to stir the ingredients for the dressing with a fork but the mayo wouldn t combine with everything else so I put everything in a small jar and shook it all up. Great recipe!!!",
