Feel free to leave your circles whole if you like nice big round cookies -- the baking time is the same. The recipe makes an astounding amount of dough so it's easy to freeze half of it for later. For best freshness or if you are going to freeze the baked cookies wrap the cookies individually with plastic wrap as soon as they reach room temperature to preserve the moisture and cakelike quality. You can also put them in a cookie jar with a piece of bread.",
