One important thing that I have learned when baking with low fat/fat free products is to NOT overstir (like with muffins) - overstirring activates the gluten in the flour and the lack of fat particles in the batter is what leads to a chewy or rubbery cookie. If you mix all your wet ingredients really well and then mix in your flour just until homogenous (I fold it in with a rubber spatula rather than trying to use beaters) it will help the cookie to maintain more of a cookie texture. Hope this helps!:)",

I also followed their advice and added the 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp cinnamon. Instead of using 2 eggs I used 1/4 cup egg beaters. I was very scepticle when mixing up these cookies but to my surprise they were really tasty. My 4 year old loved them as well. Great low fat and healthy alternative.",
