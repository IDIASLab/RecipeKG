So I also used 3 lbs of broccoli as that is what I had used 7 cups of chicken broth and increased the whipping cream to 3/4 c. To finish off the individual servings in the oven rather than a slice of toast I placed some Twistos on top (dill and garlic flavoured) and topped it with a mix of shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese (it's what we had on hand). It was delicious... The Twistos got a little soggy so will try the toast next time.",
