I adapted this recipe slightly, in the following respects: I pureed the cottage cheese first in the blender, in small batches.  Then I used an electric mixer to combine the pureed cottage cheese with the other ingredients, adding one ingredient at a time and mixing very well.  I omitted the milk and lemon juice, and increased the vanilla to two teaspoons. I had more than enough filling for the prepared graham crust I used, so I baked the extra in a ramekin.",

I then topped with light whipped topping and sprinkled with more cinnamon.  Delicious!",

I made it even lower in fat by mixing corn syrup with the graham craker crumbs and pressing that into the lightly greased pie plate. The cottage cheese mixture is so wet when it gets poured in that it soaks into the crust and keeps it together so really the butter is not needed. Thanks for this recipe I love it.",
