Be very careful taking the squash out of the pot so you don't spill any of the melted filling and so you don't burn yourself. When I cook squash in the IP in the future, I may just cook it plain and add the filling once it's done.",

Since I love acorn squash, I will use this when pinched for time, but baking will still be my favorite way to prepare.",

The only difficulty I had in getting the squash out of my Instant Pot was that the squash was soft once cooked through. The flavors are good and I will be keeping this recipe for future use. My adjustments are as follows: Cook time done at 5 minutes with 7 minute natural release as per the recipe although after testing the squash I put it back in for another 3 minute cook time and let it natural release for 14 minutes before serving. I also doubled my glaze quantitity for the flavor.",
