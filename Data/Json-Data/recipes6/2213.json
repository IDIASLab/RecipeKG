I doubled the vanilla and used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon. My main issue with it was that I had to cook it for 75 minutes and put foil around the edges the last 15 minutes. The edges didn't burn but they were very dark. I used the butter spread sticks and I think they worked well in the bread. I was skeptical about using the spread on the pan instead of my usual Pam spray but the bread came out fine with no sticking or burning.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was OK. I was pleasantly surprised at the ingredients list for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter brand spread but was disappointed at its lacking flavor. It held well in baking but considering this recipe calls for 1 cup of 'not butter' and one stick of butter is equal to 1/2 cup... I'd rather stick (no pun intended) with butter in baking. A great deal of spread has to be used to substitute for butter. I let my bananas fully ripen followed the recipe and added chopped walnuts. This recipe was extremely easy to prepare. I had no issues with sweetness as other users had complained but they did state their bananas weren't riped enough. I'm not sure if it was my oven but I needed to cover the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes of cooking time. The banana bread was lacking in flavor. I believe this was due to I Can't Believe It's Not Butter being made of cooking oils and butter being made with sweet cream. Banana bread is so common that it's hard to impress people with anyway. Points to them for attempting a recipe that nearly all cooks claim their recipe tastes better. I am glad I gave this recipe a try but doubt I would make it again.",

This recipe came out crunchy on top soft in the middle and had just the right amount of banana flavor. I baked for 60 minutes at 350 then put some aluminum foil loosely over the top because I didn't want the outside to burn then put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes. It was perfect!",
