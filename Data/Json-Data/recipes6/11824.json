And they are very very tasty! The dates make it a nicer cookie than raisins which can be a little tart or bitter sometimes. Great just out of the oven or a couple days later these are a permanent addition to my recipe box.",

I got 11 dozen using a small cookie scoop per it calling for dropping by the teaspoon. Very good cookie and because I had so many I sold them by the dozen to friends who also loved them. Would be great to make for bake sales or gifts. Can't imagine how big the cookies would be were there only 48. I baked 12 to a cookie sheet. They also took 10 - 12 minutes in my oven but that could very according to each over and perhaps between electric and gas I have gas. I will make again.",
