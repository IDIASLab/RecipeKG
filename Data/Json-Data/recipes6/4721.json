I omitted the sun dried tomatoes and dill because I'm not a fan of either and secondly I thought they (the sun dried tomatoes) might taste odd with the other ingredients. Instead I used what I had in the fridge which was a red bell pepper and two small tomatillos (which added a great tartness to the dish) It turned out very well with all of the other ingredients and to finish I mixed in a dollop of Greek yogurt to add a little acidic creaminess and make it almost korma like. Very tasty.",

It is a very filling and hearty meal, which is something I look for when I cook vegetarian. -- I cooked it with golden couscous instead of whole wheat, omitted sun-dried tomatoes, and added about a 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes to it later in the process. Everything about this dish was good & I will likely consider making it on a monthly basis. The only thing I may consider altering further is adding a bit more veggie broth. The final product I made wasn't too dry but it could've been a little wetter.",
