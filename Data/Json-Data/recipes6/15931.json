(Unfortunately Grandma never wrote anything down and now she's gone!) I rolled the dough (which was a little too sticky I had to add lots of flour when I rolled it out) thicker to a 1/2 inch or so so the cookies are more cake-like. Obviously had to cook longer. I may try the others on this website to see if their recipes are an even closer match to Grandma's but these were very good.",
