These cookies have always been a favorite and I happened to eat one at Subway the other day and it sent me on a mission to find a great recipe--and this is it!  They are the best looking and tasting cookies I've ever made.  Next time I will take them out a little sooner than I think they should--to make a softer cookie but even though I don't like cookies on the crispy side I love these!  I'm so glad I tried this recipe first!  I've made cookies with white chocolate chips before and the chopped white chocolate bar/almond bark makes a big difference!",
