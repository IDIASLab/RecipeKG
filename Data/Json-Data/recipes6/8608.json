Reserved pineapple juice to use equal juice and teriyaki sauce in place of oyster sauce. Reduced eggs to just 2.  Added some crushed garlic to hot oil before adding rice to fry. Did this because when reading directions it said to add garlic powder however I did not see this on the ingredients list.  Lastly, sliced pineapple chunks into thin slices. This is a great recipe.  I am surprised it has not been reviewed more.  Was asked to share the recipe.",

By the end of the night I was being called the \"RICE QUEEN\"!  I had never made this before the day of the party.....Lucky me!  I got the sausage from a local phillipine grocery store and used 2 reg size cans of tidbit pinapple instead of one and light SPAM.  Held well in crock pot on low.  Don't skimp on regular rice definatly use the Jasmine rice!  YUMMY!!!  Must Try!",

I also used fried rice seasoning instead of oyster sauce (im not a fishy person) and it was really great. The seasoning and the sausage made it really flavorful. My only change is that I would probably add more pineapple (was really hard to taste it). Over all this was a great recipe and pretty easy to make too!",

Everything else was exactly the same.  If forced to make any changes to the original (other than the ones I already made, HA!), I would use a big can of pinapple, instead of the small...I really enjoyed coming across those little sweet pieces, and wished there were more.

I then rolled it up like a burrito, sliced it into small strips and set it aside. I cooked both the spam and lup cheong in the skillet without the 2 tsp. of oil. Once the sausages were rendered I added the cold rice using the grease from the spam and sausages to coat the rice. I added one garlic clove, chopped, in place of the garlic powder, thou the garlic powder wasn\u2019t listed as an ingredient called for in this recipe. I stirred everything then added the oyster sauce, Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I added the pineapple bits and eggs and stirred to combine well. I sprinkled with some chopped green onions. I could see the pineapples bits, chopped spam, lup cheong and specks of green onions throughout the fried rice. There is a nice sweetness from pineapple bits and saltiness from oyster sauce and sausages. A nice change from plain ole\u2019 white rice with a tasty blend of flavors.  Thank you for sharing!",

Added some peas for a veg. Was a little dry but I blame the pineapple no juice. Plus as the entire SPAM-eating world knows SPAM has to be cooked crispy. Will for sure make again after I cook up some GF Oyster sauce. Will be super with that and canned pineapple with juice plus mixed veg and double the onion! Thanks Chen for an easy complete meal.

When frying the cooked rice in the canola oil, it never toasted. Second, although I doubled the amount of pineapple I found the dish to be lacking in flavor.  I ended up putting soy sauce on the table for anyone wanting to add more flavor.  Sorry because I was really  looking forward to this dish.",
