I decided to adjust this recipe and see what happened.  I used Splenda, 1% milk and Egg Creations liquid egg product and crossed my fingers.  The result was AMAZING!  It set wonderfully, was creamy and tasted sweet and rich with vanilla.  My suggestion is to never rush a custard and cover the cooling custard with a film of plastic wrap so that it lays directly on top of the custard.  This prevents a 'crusty film' from forming.  Thank you so much for your contribution!",
