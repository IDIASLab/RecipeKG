With the instant store bought ones, he uses three packets and a tiny bit of water in order to keep the flavor (way too dry for me). You can imagine how quickly he was going through the packets. Sorry, but I did make a minor change which does not negate yours - I skipped the instant milk and used whole milk rather than water to make it. Now just need to figure out other flavor mixtures like the maple and brown sugar.",
