I made this the night before thought pretty simple and it was...however what caught me off and I prayed I didn't waste ingredients was the 1st 6 ingredients listed....it smell funky. BUT and I worried about it all night...BUT BUT BUT!!!! After following all instructins and marinading over night I was totally shocked and totally happy with the out come. I did add 2 tsp celery seed in the 1st step because I totally love celery seed due to my preference. Somehow the flavors just melded together and the smell was not there like the night before. This is wonderful. Onions and Bell Peppers were tender crisp still had the crunch to it and all the ingredients just worked very well with each other. My kids sampled and are totally excited about having this with dinner......Thanks Stephanie everyone gave this a HIGH 5!!!",

I doubled the celery seeds and added finely chopped Italian Flat Leaf parsley (only because I am growing it and needed to harvest some). Also I only had one can of corn of corn so for the second can of corn I used the equivalent of frozen corn- and I also replaced the can of baby peas with the equivalent of frozen baby peas. The texture taste ease and economic value of this salad was just what I wanted. Nice not to have a cream based salad during hot summer picnics too. We ate some right off the bat and although better with time to meld-- this could be served right away. Only thing I might do differently next time is double the pimentos or add half of a red bell pepper (chopped) because the red color is really nice in the salad. Thanks Stephanie for a great side dish!",
