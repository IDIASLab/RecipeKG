For this recipe to be a success, you have to know a little about potatoes.  Notice the recipe called for BAKING potatoes.  Red ones will be gummy.  Yukon Golds make GOOD mashed potatoes. Start them off in COLD water so everything will reach boiling at the same time.  When they are tender, drain them in a colandar and let them STEAM.  The more steam is gone, the more the potatoes will absorb the milk.  (No problem with 'soupy' potatoes here...you even MAY have to add more milk than the recipe calls for.  While the potatoes are steaming, heat the butter and milk in the same pot you cooked the potatoes in.  (Why wash another pan?) Add the steamed potatoes and mash and season.  (I've had my share of 'gummy' and 'soupy' mashed potatoe in my time :)  Oh! And if this is for a special occasion...use cream instead of milk.  Over the top!!!",
