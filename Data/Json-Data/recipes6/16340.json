I know the recipe calls for canned beets but I needed to use mine! I found another recipe describing cooking beets (boil for 45 minutes rinse in cold water so the skins peel right off...which they did!) Be sure to save some of the water from boiling the beets to serve as the beet juice needed in recipe. I had red all over my kitchen...new appreciation for the term \"beet red!\" but it cleaned up easily and the beets taste surprisingly great. Kind of exotic tasting with the spices. Thanks for opening up my thinking to beets!",
