The batter looked exactly as it should and it baked exactly as it should without issues. The one issue I'm having is that it turned out a little flavorless and the texture was off-putting. I feel terrible saying it honestly. I shared one muffin with my two kids and after the first bite noone really wanted any more. I think for me if I were to make this again this would need more cinnamon (or maybe some additional spices) a little more vanilla and.......gosh maybe something else. I can't put my finger on what it's missing. Three and a half stars for me.",

I was out of yogurt, so used a mashed banana and a 1/4 cup of oil to replace it which worked well.  I also think you could get away with a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup if you are watching your sugar intake.  I  will definitely be experimenting with adding dried fruits or nuts as I have to agree with other reviewers who found it lacking a little something.",

I also added a smidge more vanilla and cinnamon than called for. And I realized after I started that I was out of oat bran so I just used quick cooking oats. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Baked them in mini muffin tins (non stick metal trays gas oven) for 10 minutes rotated the trays then cooked about 5 minutes more. Perfectly moist and delicious! Normally I don't give 5 star ratings if I make changes but I don't think anything I did was a major change from the recipe as written. 5 stars it is!",
