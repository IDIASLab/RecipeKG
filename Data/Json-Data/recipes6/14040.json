I will reduce the sugar and honey next time by half as I found this bread a bit sweet for everyday use. I don't keep cornmeal in my pantry so I used 1/4c of Red River (or sunny boy) whole grain cereal. I love hearty whole grain breads and this is better than any other bread machine loaf I have made from my bread maker. I did my last rise out of the machine basted it with butter and baked at 350f for 25 mins next time I will bake at 325f for at least 35 mins as it was a bit under done but the crust was quite dark. I also made a second batch and divided it into 12 dinner rolls and baked at 325f for 35 mins these turned out perfectly. Thanks for a great starter recipe!!!",
