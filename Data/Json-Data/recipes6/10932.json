I also added about 3/4 cup coconut.  Instead of dicing the bananas, I mashed them.  I used two 8\" round cake pans greased, floured, and the bottoms lined with parchment paper - I baked at 350F for approx 35-40 min.  After the cakes cooled I assembled the layer cake, frosting the layers with cream cheese frosting and garnishing the side of the cake with more shredded coconut.\n\nThanks Carol for sharing this great recipe!!",

I read the reviews first and noticed a lot of others thought reducing the oil was a good idea. I wanted to use apple sauce instead of oil anyway so I thought I would use 1 to 1 1/4 cups apple sauce in place of the oil. I however only had 3/4 cup apple sauce so I used it and also added 1/4 cup oil. I used 3 9\" pans instead of the bundt pan as well then frosted it with cream cheese frosting and pressed additional nuts into the frosting. The cake turned out wonderful got a lot of compliments. But next time I will use 1 1/4 cups apple sauce and no oil. This will cut down on the fat and makes for a very moist and tasty cake.",

Also added crushed pineapples to the icing mix for more pineapple taste as well as to keep the icing from being so thin. I had to stop playing hostess to get my husband and myself a piece as it went that quickly. Everyone (reviewers) that thinks it is sweet enough without the icing is certainly missing out on a treat. I made both versions but ended up throwing away half of the the \"icing free\" version (glad I only made a small heart shaped one). Also followed suggestion to make a topping fo ricing out of cinnamon brown sugar and pecans. That was superb. Will definitely make again.",
