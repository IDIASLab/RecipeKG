If you like orange chicken sesame chicken sweet and sour anything or general tso kinds of Americanized \"Chinese\" food then this will likely be up your alley. I doubled the recipe and made it for a group of 20 on Super Bowl Sunday and there were lots of leftovers. So its safe to say it just wasn't a favorite of ours. While I probably won't make it again if it were being served somewhere wouldn't pass it up either. Thanks Kari for the interesting addition!",
