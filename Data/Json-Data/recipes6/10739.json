Still a dense cake that you would expect to get by adding fruit or veggies (apple, carrot, etc) but definitely a cake like texture.  I used an angel food cake pan and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  Nice rounded top and the cake would have been delicious without the frosting.  I used 1/2 of a cream cheese frosting recipe and added 1/2 of a banana. The result was a runny frosting (although it tasted good) even with adding more powdered sugar.  Next time I'll use banana flavoring in the frosting instead of the banana, although the cake would have been wonderful without any icing. ",

It did Not have the dense quality of banana bread like some reviewers said. It was light and moist. I think the secret is to  cream the sugar and margarine (or butter)really well and then add the eggs and mix those in  before adding the rest of the ingredients. I was going to make a glaze for it but the family started eating it as soon as I turned it out of the pan. I will definately make this again!",

I made it for Mother's Day, frosted it with vanilla cream cheese frosting and was envisioning a fluffy, moist cake. Unfortunately, it's like banana bread with frosting - really dense, with a slight chew.  Although it was quite delicious,  we just couldn't get past the texture.  I think if you go into it with the understanding that it's more like a bread (and maybe skip the frosting?) you'll be more satisfied with the results.  I think we figured out the SURPRISE! part of the title....",

Only used 2 banana's as thats all I had beat the eggs one at a time into the creamed butter/sugar before adding the flour & added about 1/4 cup of milk as the batter was a little dry. Also it took about 45mins to bake (but I have a slow oven). Will be using this recipe with the changes from now on!",

Baking soda only reacts with an acid, otherwise it's useless in this cake. Buttermilk would've been a great addition somewhere in this recipe with the right modifications of ratios of course.
