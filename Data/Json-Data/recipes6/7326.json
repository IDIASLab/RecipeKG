It's definitely got the yogurt tang (Dannon nofat vanilla Greek yogurt) but I think it's because of the brand I chose. Don't worry about the chia seeds - you won't really feel/taste them - they'll swell overnight. I don't know that I love the cinnamon in here might try without that and none to little honey next time. But it's healthy (I think I can eat the entire thing without worrying) but I will spread it out over days so that trumps everything. Definitely not the prettiest it's a fairly ugly (ok really ugly) dip but your tummy won't care:). The hubby didn't care for it - it's not his thing...",
