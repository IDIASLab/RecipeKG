Add yummy caramel and chopped nuts to the top (or crushed toffee bits/candy) and let it sit for a few hours.  EASY AND YUMMY!",

I thought that the oatmeal crust would pair up nicely with the apples.\nThen I followed the technique used in the \"Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake\" recipe to make the filling.  I spread half of the filling onto the crust.  Then I mixed in about 1/2 a can of apple pie filling, some spices, and whipped it with the cream cheese.  I was able to blend the apple pieces using my mixer, but you may want to cut them into smaller chunks if they are large.\nFinally, I spread this layer onto the plain cream cheese layer and baked it.\nI didn't add any apple filling onto the top because it looked moist enough already, but I did drizzle some caramel over the top before baking.\nThanks for the inspriation to experiment with different cheesecake flavors!",
