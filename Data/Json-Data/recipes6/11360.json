For one even though I followed the directions to the letter the cake didn't rise as much as I expected it should've. Secondly the glaze turned out much too thin so I added more chocolate and corn syrup to thicken it up enough for it to actually glaze the cake instead of being soaked up by the cake. All in all it tasted delicious but be prepared to monkey a bit with the recipe.",
