I also added 1/4 cup of granulated sugar but I recommend tasting it before doing so in case it's already sweet enough. A similar recipe called for 1 tsp of vanilla which I'll have to try next time. I served this dip with Pink Lady apples and it was a huge hit! Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!",
