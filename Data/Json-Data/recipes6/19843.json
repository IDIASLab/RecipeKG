DEFINATELY follow the last review about switching from 1/2 cup of melted butter to 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup oil this is critical to making it better. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon not 1/2 t to the topping along with alittle zest from the orange. And to the batter I added another 1/4 t and 1/4 t nutmeg this makes the actual cake much more tasty.",

The cake itself was very moist and rose high but it was not sweet enough at all and was a bit too oily. If I had not added the extra sugar it would have tasted like bread. If you make this for breakfast and are not expecting something sweet it is ok but if you are comparing it to a traditional coffee cake it loses big time. I may try again with an additional cup of sugar and less oil and see what happens.",
