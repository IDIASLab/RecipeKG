One MAJOR change---I made 1 1/2 times the marinade as I will NOT reuse marinade that has been used on raw chicken. I went ahead and followed the instructions and boiled it but I'm not sure what the benefit was there. I took this to a party and it went over great! Everyone loved it. To serve that purpose I cut the chicken up into chunks then put it over the rice. This was a great marinade and does great things for the rice also.",

I was cooking this in -26' weather so I did not grill it but I did cut it into tender size strips which cut down on marinating time and cooked it for about 5 minutes on the George Foreman Grill. For added nutrition I used brown rice with carrots green pepper celery and onion with a little bit of olive oil. I also did not use the same marinade the chicken was in I made extra sauce and set it aside the pineapple in the marinade was good on the rice.",

I boiled the marinade as instructed (which would elimate any risk of salmonella or other bacteria to reference the previous reviews comment) which made it even MORE concentrated. I suggest adding some water to it after its boiled a bit to cut down on the overpowering taste of the salty soy sour lemon and tangy pineapple. But in the end I found this to be a fabulous combo of flavours!",
