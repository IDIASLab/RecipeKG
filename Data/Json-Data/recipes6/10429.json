For me, the batch yielded 24 'regular' sized muffins and they baked for 17 minutes a batch. Like others have said, the glaze truly is 'the icing on the cake.' The flavor is soooo good!",

Thank you, Liz R, for sharing!   The taste and texture are amazing.  This recipe is the most like Costco's muffins that I've found. \n\nI, too, did what another reviewer did.  Mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately, then folded the dry into the wet.  This made 24 of the medium sized muffins (aka 2\" x 1 1/4\").  I found no need for the glaze, though next time I will put more poppy seeds into the mix.\n\nIf you have trouble with those nasty store bought muffin papers that are so splayed out that they won't stay in the muffin tins, Reynolds has boxes of 500 (in several sizes) for around $4 at the store known by different names in different areas:  Cash and Carry, United Grocer's or Smart and Final.  Though not a retailer, if you spend cash you can generally purchase what you need there, no business license required.\n\nAlso, poppy seeds have enough oil that they go rancid quickly if on the store shelf or home shelf too long.  Do the 'sniff' test before baking with them.  They should smell earthy, but not 'icky'.  If there is a smell that is not good, it won't bake out but will make your food taste nasty.  Store fresh seeds in one zip freezer bag nested into a 2nd bag and freeze between uses.",

Here's what I did: I used 3 eggs, 1/8 C. Vegetable Oil, 1 C. Apple Sauce, 1 1/2 C. Milk, 1 1/2 Tsp. Vanilla Extract, 1 1/2 Tsp. Almond Extract, 1 1/2 C. White Sugar, 1 1/2 Tsp. Salt, 1 1/2 Tsp. Baking Powder, 1 1/2 Tbsp. Poppy Seeds, 3 C. All-Purpose Flour. I mixed the glaze and had it on the stove before I made the Muffins. I mixed together eggs, apple sauce, vegetable oil, milk, vanilla, and almond. In separate bowl, I mixed together sugar, salt, baking powder, poppy seeds, and flour. Fold wet ingredients into dry. Don't mix too much. Batter should be lumpy. Grease pan thoroughly (no paper). Fill almost full.\n\nIn a Regular Cupcake Pan: Bake at 350 F for 30-35 min. or until toothpick comes out clean. (Best indicator is when the tops finally look dry) - Makes 14-16\n\nRemove muffins as soon as you can from pans while still warm/hot and dunk tops into glaze. Turn right side up and cool on a cookie rack.",
