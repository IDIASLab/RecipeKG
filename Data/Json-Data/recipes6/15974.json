I'm in the process of making it again and I think I'll just use less liquid. It does turn out much like a cracker (great for fruit salsa or yogurt cheese) but if you want a softer bread bake for less time. Also I tried topping the two of the bread each with cayenne parmesean crushed garlic and sesame seeds (like it says) and I also made a plain batch. All of them are very nice especially the parmesean (it gets all wonderfully golden and crunchy). The plain one was kind of bland but still alright. This recipe goes in my recipe box.",
