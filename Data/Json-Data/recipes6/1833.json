I made a half batch, using a heaping 1/4 cup of honey in place of sugar, almond in place of peanut butter, 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon, nut milk in place of regular milk, and I mixed everything together instead of layering. I would use a hand mixer to mix all wet ingredients including the mashed bananas next time. There will be a next time, It is delicious!",

I don't think halving the batter to put the chocolate chips in the middle was necessary next time I'll just mix them in and bake the whole thing at once. 30 min in 8x8 pan was perfect for a half batch. Tastes like a banana bread coffee cake!",
