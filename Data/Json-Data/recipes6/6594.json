I used 3 cans of golden mushroom, a 16 oz container of sour cream,\r\nan 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms sliced and about 3/4 cup of milk.

I used paper towels to remove drippings off the meatballs then I placed them in a 9x13 dish,completely covered them with the sauce and baked about 45 min.Served over egg noodles.
