You want to break off the leaves of the cabbage and place them in a bowl, sprinkling a little salt on each leaf as you go. After salting the cabbage, fill the dish with water and then let it soak for 3-4 hours. Massage the cabbage then drain and rinse. Chop cabbage into 2-3 inch segments then toss well with the rest of the ingredients (I wouldn't suggest using ginger, vinegar, or sugar; but do what you think you'll like). Then pack it tightly into a jar, you don't want a lot of air within the jar, so use the right size jar. Kimchee is a fermented cabbage dish, therefore, if you leave it out in a warm area for 24-48 hours instead of refridgerating, the taste will be authentic. It's more of an acquired taste. It will also last way more than a week, I'd say about a month easy. We ate it straight out of the bottle; it goes well with some rice! :)",

The only change I made was adding a few dried hot peppers and putting all ingredients in a blender (because I prefer to bite into nothing but the cabbage). When I read the ingredients I honestly wasn't so sure if this was going to taste like Kimshi exactly & I used regular Chili powder & had to substitute 1/2 apple cider vinegar & 1/2 red wine vinegar (since that is all I had). But I can tell after about 12 hours only that this is truly Kimshi. This stuff is going to be absolutely fantastic in another day. I accidentally used red cabbage & can just imagine how dynamite this stuff is with Chinese cabbage. Kimshi is not always easy to find here so this is just wonderful to know this recipe is so good & I can make it at home now.",

I followed another reviewer's advice and simply left the jarred Kimchee out on the kitchen counter for a couple of days. The flavor was wonderful (if a little too gingery!). I served this with 'Korean BBQ Beef (Pul-Kogi)' from this site. I'll defintiely make it again. Thanks John!",
