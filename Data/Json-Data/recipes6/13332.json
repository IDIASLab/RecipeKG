Here's what NOT to do: don't use a graham cracker crust it absorbed all of the gelatin mixture and became mushy. And speaking of the gelatin mixture--don't use regular jello; I guess plain gelatin sets up differently huh? And/or I didn't let this cool enough before pouring it over the cherries in the shell. Any-who it still came out tasting great and I'm going to have to make this again (following the recipe EXACTLY!) so that I can update my rating to a 5-star. At least it was only an \"experiment\" on my family and not for guests:-)",
