I used fresh strawberries and cherries (not sour cherries) - I sliced the berries and cherries and sprinkled them with sugar/lemon juice, stirred and let them sit for about 5 minutes.  I mixed the dry ingredients (tapioca, sugar, cornstarch & salt) with 3/4 cup of water and the juice from the berries, let it boil for 5 minutes, added the sliced fruit and boiled for another 2 mintues.  I used a \"shortbread cookie\" crust (like a graham cracker crust), no top crust and baked it at 350 F for 20 minutes.  My husband and kids were disappointed that there was only 1 pie and not 1 EACH!!!!",
