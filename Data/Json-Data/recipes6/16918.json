I was making it for a tropical-themed party, and no sooner did I finish making it (and tasting it!) when I realized that it was gonna go WAY too fast, so I quickly whipped up a second batch.  Some changes you might find helpful:  1)  I increased the butter to 2 Tbsp., just to enhance the buttery taste; and 2)  I substituted the 1 tsp. vanilla extract for 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. coconut extracts.  Another experiment I tried:  I cut back on the macadamia nuts a little bit, and added some chopped toasted coconut covered cashews for my second batch.  The toasted coconut flavor permeated the entire brittle!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!",

The reason is that the recipe fails to mention that you need to take it out and STIR IT THOROUGHLY halfway through the cooking time after the nuts are added. Also in my microwave it can really only take 3-and-a-half minutes of cooking - NOT four - without getting overdone and I have a small microwave so be aware that every microwave is different and will require different timing and you may have to experiment the first time you make this. But once you get the timing right for your microwave oven it really is delicious.",

Other items I include: about 10 different kinds of cookies homemade freezer jams my famous lemon-cornmeal bread candied pecans and some kind of homemade ornament. Anyway I made the brittle just as the recipe directs and put about 7 good sized pieces in each clear small gift bag and tied it with pretty ribbon. It was a big hit! Thanks...an update 12/23/10: This year I used coarsely chopped cashews and cut back from 4 minutes in the microwave to 3 after adding the nuts. Perfection. I made 4 batches and all turned out well. BTW I use heavy duty foil and butter that. Makes for easy cleanup.",

I stopped it and pulled the mixture out. Smoke was billowing out of my microwave. I read all the reviews ran to the store and tried again. This is what I learned: do not use Dry Roasted Macadamias use RAW macadamias; when you add the nuts cook it a minute at a time stirring and checking after each minute mine only took two minutes for that part of the recipe. It was difficult to spread. I was thinking that next time I might stick the baking sheet with the coconut under the broiler for the last minute of the microwaving process. Hopefully the hot pan and hot coconut will allow me to spread the brittle mixture better. However the bottom line is that everyone loved it and it was gone by the end of the party.",
