This one does have kidney beans instead of the traditional black beans and the brown sugar tames the spiciness a bit but it does still have a kick (and that's fine with me). The Rotel that I had on hand was diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro so that's what I used. This is a nice basic bean salad recipe and I liked it but I wasn't WOW'd by it not that that's a bad thing.",

A bit more work but once it was all mixed it was simply delicious!! Bravo on a nice easy and tasty recipe!!",

I used balsamic instead of white vinegar and I doubled the vinegar and sugar. Soooo basically completely different but totally worth making- easy cheap and I got the fam to eat beans!
