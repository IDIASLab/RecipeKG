I do not use coffee cans but a Tube Pan (much like a bundt pan but the center is removable from the base). I cook it at the same temperature and same time. A Nice Touch! I brush egg whites on the top of the Babka after te first process of \"baking for 15 minutes @400 Degrees\"...AND after a while I do notice it turning brown I then cover it w/foil. It has turned out perfect each time!..2 LARGE/TALL Babkas every year (very moist!) for the past 3 years!",

I also used my bread machine but hand folded the raisins/ cranberries. The first time I used only the raisins and tossed them into the bread machine. Didn't turn out so good. The raisins were all torn apart. I also noticed that once you fold the raisins/cranberries in the rise before you bake takes almost all day. Without the raisins/cranberries it takes only 2 hours for it to rise. I made half the dough without the raisins/cranberries and then half with. Make sure you let the dough rise in a butter spread pan before you bake. I warm my oven for a few minutes and then turn it off and let the dough rise in a warm area. After its done baking I spread lightly in mixer: first 1 egg white until fluffy then add powdered sugar until thick. Spread it on the warm bread as soon as it s done baking and let it dry. Can also sprinkle the top with sprinkles before it dries.",
