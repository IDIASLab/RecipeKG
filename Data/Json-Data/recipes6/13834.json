You couldn't taste a lot of liquor - just a hint which surprised me. It was clearly an adult sweet potato recipe - not the cloyingly sweet marshmallowy mess and we really really liked this one.

The canned don't need to cook as long but are almost as good as starting with fresh - and certainly a time saver. I really love this recipe! I've also used Jack Daniels for the whiskey and substituted Splenda or stevia herb for the sugar. You might want to cut back just a bit on the liquor as it can be overpowering for some.

But you don't need to make more sauce really! If you make more of anything then make more of everything! (You're going to need a big baking dish and turn occassionaly to help cook evenly.) The potatoes will definitely cook down and the sauce will thicken up and this side dish will be the first one gone at any potluck!!",
