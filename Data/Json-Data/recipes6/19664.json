I know the cucumbers can 'leak' their juices and make too much liquid so I usually add them close to serving, but I didn't know about that cool trick with the salt. I will be trying that next time I make these.  Also I found out when my hubby makes these he uses red wine or apple cider vinegar which gives this a great taste.  I noticed one reviewer said she used sour cream because she had no mayo...my Mom used to do that also, I found out my sister tends to make it that way.  Again, thanks for trying the recipe and glad you like it.\nLisa Pav",

It had the perfect blend of what I was looking for, although I did add a bit more vinegar, and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, and used walla walla onions.

I couldnt find my white vinegar so I used rice vinegar (then found the white) and it also worked very well. There is something about the combination of cool cucmber and the salty sweet dressing that makes you want to have more. I kept taking sneak bites before I could put it in the fridge to cool. \r\nI wouldnt do anything different, Yum!",
