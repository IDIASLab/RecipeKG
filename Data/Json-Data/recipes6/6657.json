Old review: These were okay but next time I think I'll bake them in the oven. I'm not a big fan of the charred skin from bbq'ing them. Or perhaps I need to learn how to better bbq chicken wings. The flavor was pretty good though hubby liked them a lot and they were easy enough to prepare. So I will try them again next wing night and see what oven baked is like. Or learn how to bbq without charring them beyond recognition.",
