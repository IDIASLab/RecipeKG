I cubed my own celery carrots and green peppers. I also threw in a TBLS of minced garlic and used 1 can of beef broth and one less cup of water. If you use \"fresh\" venison (meaning - it hasn't sat in your freezer forever. Venison tends to taste gamier the longer it sits in your freezer) you can't tell the meat is venison. Very good very easy and when I'm in the mood to spoil my man I'll send some with him when he heads up north to the cabin. Thanks Jaimee!",

A word of caution to you \"finiky\" folks...this soup WILL retain it's \"gamey\" flavor, though it is rather subtle.  Do not think that you can simply simmer it out.
