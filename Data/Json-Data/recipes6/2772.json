I used 1/2t crushed red pepper instead of the dried chiles.  'Think I'd up to 3/4t next time.  Plain oil, not hot chili; & rice wine vinegar instead of Chinese black vinegar.  That's okay, right?  ;D  I think the more I have this, the more I'll like it.  It's a bit salty.  Salt & I are friends so that's okay, but may up the sugar a weensy - or take the easy way out & less soy.  It's good.  Try it.  :) ... S liked a lot & suggested adding shrimp.  Huh!  Huh-huh, may just ... !",

                "reviewBody": "Pretty good recipe for an asian cucumber salad. My only real complaint is that I felt the sesame overpowered the recipe and would cut back on the amount a little. However, I did have to make a few substitutes. I scaled down the recipe to make 2 servings and added some crushed red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp: substitute is 1/4-1/2 tsp crushed red pepper per dried red chile pepper). I didn\u2019t have black vinegar and used rice wine vinegar, which I think is why I was missing the little bit of sweetness from how my Chinese Mom made it when I was growing up. She tells me next time in a pinch, try \u201ccombining rice wine vinegar with sugar\u201d or \u201ca little water, a little rice wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar (vinegar in equal measurement but more on the water\u201d.  My husband thought it was spicy but I didn\u2019t. My rating of 4 stars is solely based on the amount of sesame oil as I felt it to be over powering, but this is easy to adjust to my liking. Thank you for the recipe!",
