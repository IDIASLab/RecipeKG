My grandmothers recipe separates the eggs and you whip the egg whites and then fold them into the batter after you cream the butter and sugar then adding in the yolks mixing well then adding flour in- it gets hard to mix so I use a kitchenaid now. However I remember my grandmother did it by hand with a big wooden spoon. Also I add more vanilla like double the amount listed and its real vanilla not the imitation stuff. I make vanilla extract with vodka and vanilla beans. Real vanilla will add so much more flavor to these cookies. These are Christmas tradition at my house since I was a kid. Enjoy!",
