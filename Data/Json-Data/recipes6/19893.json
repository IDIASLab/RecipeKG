This recipe called for 8 eggs but because we watch our fat, I used 4 whole eggs and 8 whites.  I also used a little more raisins and added the juice and rind of one orange.  I think because of the sweetness of the orange, I might use a little less sugar next time.  My crowd dosen't usually eat sweet kugel but they devoured it.  It was light, moist and extremely tasty.  This will definitely be the kugel I make for all my future Passover dinners.",
