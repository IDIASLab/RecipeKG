Also I didn't have granola so I added extra oats and rice puffs instead. Also my son doesn't like much fruit used some currants and added pepitas and sunflower seeds. Also I don't like to use sugar so I used a heaped tblspn of organic peanut and cocoa spread. So after I realized I mucked it up I decided to bake it for about 10min. All in all my son (who is celiac) absolutely loved them and I now have to make them again and remember what I did!",
