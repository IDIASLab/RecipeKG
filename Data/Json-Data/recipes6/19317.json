                "reviewBody": "So I should clear up a few of the problems here...\n\nThis was a Christmas favorite when I was a kid. My mother used both orange and lemon peels, and I learned from her.\n\nRegarding the bitterness:  This comes from the oils in the peel, not from the pith, which is virtually tasteless.  To reduce bitterness in the peels, drain off the boiling water, refill with cold water and bring to a boil again.  The more you repeat this step, the less bitter it will be.  Be careful, though, because too much boiling will render your candy tasteless.  2-3 times is usually enough.  Test by tasting.\n\nI don't remove the pith; it acts as an absorbent, soaking up the sugar syrup and giving my peels body.  For that reason, I use navel oranges or thick-skinned lemons (like the huge ones that grow everywhere in Southern California).  \n\nI allow the candy to dry out until it's tacky, then toss it with sugar to finish it.  (You can use colored and/or flavored sugar too.)  This allows me to store it dry in containers without it getting sticky.  You can dry it in a cool oven (200 degrees or less) or simply let it sit out for a few hours.\n\nAlso, try adding finely ground ginger or nutmeg to the sugar (for orange peels).\n\nOr dip one end in melted chocolate and let cool (excellent with orange or lemon peels).\n\nOr dip one end in thinned royal frosting and let dry (experiment with different flavors).\n\nThere is no end to the variations that are possible.  Let the kids come up with thier own!",

                "reviewBody": "I didn't have a problem at all with this recipe, and the lemon simple syrup that is left over is wonderful for lemon drop cocktails! In fact, I'm now using this recipe for making the syrup and not the other way around!  Anyway, I prefer my candied peel to be dry and crunchy. So I leave it out in the air for a few days before storing it in an airtight container. While \"curing\", I shake the peels around a few times, to help separate them and keep them from turning into big blobs of candy. Once they're fully dry, they don't stick together unless they get damp. I also don't store mine in the refrigerator, but in the cupboard.  Some people complained of bitterness. It is probably more to do with the lemons themselves and not with the recipe. The Meyer lemons I used are too thin-peeled to really get all of the pith off, and they came out fine.  I just tried one more method for getting the peel in thin strips, without the rind. I used a citrus peeler (mine is attached to my zester, but if your zester doesn't have a peeler attached, you want the kind that bartenders use). I peeled the lemon in one long thin strip, spiraling around the lemon. If you have a spiral of peel left over, you can use your fingernail to peel it off. Make sure you chop the strips up a little bit, so that they don't get hopelessly tangled during the boiling process. I only chopped my pile into thirds, which is enough to keep most of the strips fairly long (if you want it that way) without tangling.",
