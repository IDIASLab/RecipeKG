Before grating the lemon peel, I squeezed the lemon and strained and reserved the juice for use in the glaze. The bread was golden brown and done in the center at 45 min., so be careful with the baking time.",

It barely rose at all in the oven and the loaf really only ended up about two inches thick. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the nuts and sweetening the lemon juice more at the last step. Maybe next time I'll make a double batch and make it a 9x13 cake. But as a loaf of bread this just doesn't cut it.",
