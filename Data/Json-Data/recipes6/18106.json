I used low fat milk and 1/2 packet of Truvia for the sugar. I just used the microwave to heat up the milk and water. I topped it with some sprayed whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I might just whisk the milk up next time with the Aerolatte to thicken it up a little. I can see an Irish cream dairy creamer being a fine subtitute for this. This makes a nice evening hot chocolate though. TY",
