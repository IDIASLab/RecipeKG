Added beef broth, covered and simmered for 20 minutes. Added salt and pepper to taste and continued simmering for 10 more minutes. Poured soup into bowls, added bread and covered with 2 slices of swiss cheese. Broiled until cheese melted and served. YUM!",

I will try chicken broth next time but this time I made a variation for a vegetarian friend with vegetable broth. I used only 1 1/2 large white onions which was plenty of onion. Upon tasting it I both thought it was missing something and I did not think that the sugar was necessary as the soup tasted a little sweeter than I would have liked it so I added a pinch of dried thyme and a pinch of dried parsley along with the salt and pepper. In the future I might leave the sugar out. The wine was a very nice addition. I added 1/2 cup to the onions after they were tender let it mostly bubble away and then also added 1/2 cup of wine to the broth at the step indicated in the recipe. Finally I made the French bread a few days in advance and toasted them in olive oil butter and garlic in a pan on the stove to make them into croutons before adding them to the soup. I grated swiss and smoked gouda together. Yum. Thanks for the recipe! This was a quick supper good for a late night movie with friends.",

We use Better Than Bouillon Beef stock paste and it is the best (no MSG). Look up how to caramelize onions because there is a particular way to do it for success. I am giving 3 stars for effort and subtracting two for not performing due diligence.",
