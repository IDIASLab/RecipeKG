I cut the amounts down for one subbed zucchini for cucumber and dried basil for fresh (cut the amount to just a sprinkle!) and omitted the sugar; I forgot the olives and added some cooked brown rice. Other reviewers thought the yogurt too much -- like most of what I cook from this site I used the recipe as a guide and added yogurt to MY taste so it wasn't too wet and the flavor didn't overpower. I microwaved the tomato for 1 minute then stuffed it then nuked it again as I'm not a fan of raw zucchini and I wanted the cheese melted. Lovely flavors; the tomato just collapsed which I liked tho it wound up on its side by the time I ate it! One of the fastest suppers I've had using just what I had in the fridge. Filing this one for future reference! Thanks for sharing!",

The only suggestion I'd make is to cut back on the feta and olives (be sure to use Greek Kalamata olives and not the bland black canned olives). I used half the amount of each and found that to be perfect. The amounts of everything else is just right. If you cook the tomatoes too long they will collapse so keep that in mind and adjust the time accordingly. 10 mins total seems about right for my tastes. Another thing worth mentioning you could probably skip a step and just drizzle with oil from the start. After the tomatoes are done baking I remove excess liquid from the tomatoes then stuff them. I then let them sit for at least 5 mins for the filling to warm slightly. YUM!!! I've made this twice - one using large tomatoes and the second time using small Campari tomatoes (which make the perfect appetizer!). Any excess filling would be excellent in a pita. Thank you Michael!",
