The batter is very thick and a little hard to spread. I was worried that I'd done something wrong because it was so thick, and where I did spread it, it was a very thin layer. So I spread it the best I could, and it spread across the pan and rose way more than I expected while baking. They came out perfect, with a great brownie/blondie texture. Chewy edges, sweet but not too sweet. I'll be baking these again and again!",
