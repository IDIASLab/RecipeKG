My fianc\u00e9 and I agreed that, at best, the other's were good, but nothing special.  The oatmeal really adds something special to the recipe.  We didn't have raisins so I omitted them and topped them with apples saut\u00e9ed in a pat of butter and just a bit of cinnamon (which I have done with other pancakes).  I halved the recipe and the two of us ate them all! YUM!  Don't wait until Christmas to try these easy delicious pancakes!  Will make again and again...they are definitely worth the wait!

I doubled the batch because when I make pancakes I really make pancakes. I used half buttermilk and half milk increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon and the sugar to 5 tablespoons for the double batch (based on recommendations from other reviewers) used canola oil instead of butter and added an extra slosh of milk to thin out the batter a bit after it had sat all night. Also I didn't just soak the milk and the oatmeal overnight I made up the entire recipe and put the the whole thing in the refrigerator. It made the morning easier and also allowed not only the oatmeal to absorb the liquid and flavors but also the raisins. I topped the pancakes with a little bit of agave sweetener. Others in the family used syrup or yogurt.",

They're perfect for my one-year-old son too. We've had these two weekends in a row both times skipping the raisins and adding different fruit (mixed berries then banana slices blueberries) to the batter on the skillet. PERFECT. Thanks for the great recipe. UPDATE: I've made these almost every weekend for the last 7 months. This recipe is a treasure. I call them \"magic pancakes \" because a bunch of healthy ingredients magically turns into the most delicious pancakes we've tried! I use either white-wheat flour or bread flour in place of the all-purpose and it's terrific. I also use ginger in place of cinnamon - with chopped bananas surprisingly delicious. Pancakes were a tradition for my husband when he was growing up and I'm so glad to have a way to keep that tradition alive in our family without giving my toddler food I don't feel good about. Seriously if you use wheat flour this isn't all that different from oatmeal with a pinch of sugar. Yet somehow it tastes a million times better and more special. What an ideal weekend treat. Thanks again!",
