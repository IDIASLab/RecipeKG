I've been making these for over 2 years now and I still get raves over them. I sometimes add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the recipe and also substitute 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips in the first cup of chips in the recipe. To help make handling the dough easier, I keep my hands damp with cold water, rinsing occasionally, while I'm rolling the dough into balls, I also always use parchment paper when baking any cookie recipe.",

I noticed that others had trouble with the cookies spreading, so I froze the batter for a 2-3 hours first.  I then used a small ice cream scoop to form the balls, any ice cream scoop with anti-freeze liquid in it should work.  Make sure to use a good non-stick cookie sheet but do NOT grease it!  And letting them sit for 5 minutes on the sheet to finish cooking before taking them off is a must, trying to take them off before them will only break them. I will definitely be making these again!",

It's very important to thoroughly chill the dough not just for easier handling. The first batch I baked tasted kind of floury so I had to eat them myself;). I think letting the dough rest helps absorb the flour and baking powder. I dropped by tablespoons and adjusted the baking time accordingly. I also sprinkled some cookies with sliced almonds and some with cocoanut...nice appearance. If you want cocoanut flavor you'll need to mix some cocoanut into the dough. Sprinkling on top just gave a bare hint of cocoanut flavor. This is a very good recipe and not difficult to make!",

As an added suggestion, I used a 2 Tbsp. cookie scooper to make larger balls of dough and I rolled them in powdered sugar before I baked them.  Baking them for 10-12 minutes should bake them enough since they are larger than the 1-inch recipe recommended cookie size.  I gave them out to friends and brought them into work....everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  The larger cookies yield about 2 dozen+.",

I highly recommend this recipe!  ******UPDATE 7/30/10:  This is officially my most favorite chocolate cookie EVER!  This time I added 1 1/2 tsp. Watkins raspberry flavoring and they are to die for!
