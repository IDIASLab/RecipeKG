We used corn tortillas, a fourth of an onion, a fourth of a green pepper, a full cup of enchilada sauce, no corn, and no cilantro. Yeah! Big changes, but other than that we followed the directions perfectly. The only changes we would make now would be to add a little more salt and chalula sauce. Oh ps. We fried the tortilla shells, but probably not necessary.",
