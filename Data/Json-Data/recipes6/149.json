Ingredient changes were: 1.5# sliced ham fresh mushrooms a slightly larger can of green chilies 3 carrots 2T Italian Herb seasoning (in place of fresh rosemary parsley & thyme) 1t Old Bay w/ Blackened Seasoning (in place of Creole) 1T Morton Nature's Seasons blend (in place of white pepper black pepper and salt) port instead of dry red wine & omitted black beans corn brown sugar & cayenne. In Step 1 I sauteed leek and garlic with the ham to develop more flavor. I'm guessing the 'water to cover' for me was 2C. The house smelled great while the slow cooker did its magic. The end result was a hearty & savory dish that has some zing (from the artichokes and chilies I guess) so its neither sweet nor too spicy. Great for winter lunches and suppers!",

I had to leave out the potatoes and mushrooms due to my husband's preference and the rest of the ingredients filled my crock pot to the top! (I have a 6 qt one) so be careful if you prep ahead of time. I also left out the brown sugar because of dietary restrictions and it tasted fine to me with the natural sweetness of the ingredients. The ham makes it salty so I probably could have cut the salt or left it out altogether. Overall something different for the crock pot and I would probably make this again... maybe using chicken instead of ham. Thanks!",
