I added the juice from one lemon and 2 tablespoons of confectioners sugar and boiled it down to a thick syrup and poured it over and served with strawberries. Yum. One thing I didn't understand was why melt the butter and not just soften it? I was skeptical this would have a good consistency but it worked just fine.",
