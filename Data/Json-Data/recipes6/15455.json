I'm surprised that no one else has rated or reviewed this recipe yet.\r\nInstead of grating the zucchini which would produce a soggy glob, I used the multi-holed shredder side of my 4 sided grater--worked perfectly.  I then followed the ingredients and directions as given.  I packed it tightly into a 1 pint wide mouth mason jar--with only a slight bit not fitting--and then refrigerated it overnight.  Today, for lunch, I grilled a burger and used some of the relish on it.  Absolutely delicious.  I am already thinking of other ways that I can incorporate this great flavor and texture into other dishes.  Thanks much, Sara, for publishing this recipe.",

I kicked it up a notch bu adding red and green peppers diced along with thinly sliced red onion. It added colour as well as enhanced the taste. I sampled this AM to ensure it was OK to serve for a BBQ this evening and for me it is a go Hopefully all will enjoy. Don't be afraid the enhance recipes It is amazing what you come up with",
