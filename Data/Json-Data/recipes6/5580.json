                "reviewBody": "The egg rolls turned out absolutely perfect.  I doubled the recipe just in case as I have a large family, but ended up with 20 extra egg rolls (can anyone say LEFTOVERS!?).    Being inexperienced I wasn't quite sure what to do with the spinach (leave raw or cook).  I took the safe route and cooked the leaves down in olive oil and salt beforehand.  Tasted just fine in the end product.    The recipe calls for frozen corn.  Again I took the safe route and brought them to room temperature before the mix.  I added extra cumin, as the amount recommended didn't seem to come out much in the pre frying taste.  I also sliced up some avocados and reduced the amount of filling to a little less than 1 /4 cup to compensate.    Prior to filling the egg roll wraps, I drained the filling one more time.  I noticed any left over moisture would go right through the wraps.  Anyway I think the inside of the rolls should not be wet at all after the frying.  A tip on the sealing of the wraps was to not only use water but to add flour and water (1 part water to 1 part flour).  It made a much better paste as opposed to just the water.  Obviously excess flour just fried off anyway and wasn't noticeable.  But it sure made closing the fat wraps easier.  For half the batch I used just corn oil for frying.  For the other half I used half olive oil and half corn oil.  I thought it turned out crispier and tastier with the second route.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you.",
