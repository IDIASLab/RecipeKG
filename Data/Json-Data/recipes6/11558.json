I was looking for a recipe for whipped cream frosting and happened upon this. In spite of the mixed reviews I couldn't resist. The frosting is really fluffy and is not overpoweringly sweet at all. But I couldn't make it stop separating and I beat it with commercial-grade mixer for 25 min. Finally I ended up allowing it to sit for an hour and then draining the liquid off (over a half cup) and beating it again. This time it fluffed right up and stayed that way. My family thought that it was wonderfully tasty and in light of that I will probably make it again. I would be afraid to frost a cake and take the cake to a function because it really does need to be refrigerated. Also I had to double the recipe to have enough to ice a layer cake. (Admittedly we like lots of frosting though).",

I followed the advice of some of the other raters that suggested mixing the flour and milk before putting on the heat. I cooked it until it was starting to thicken (but not thick enough to form a ball pourable thick). And instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 1 1/4. It turned out perfect and everyone loved it. It was so heavenly that it melted in your mouth. I would recommend this recipe and will definitely use it from now on when I want a buttercream frosting.",
