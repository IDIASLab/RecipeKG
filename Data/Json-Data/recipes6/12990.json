Since other readers said they were too thin in a 9x13 I made mine in an 11x7, which I think was perfect.  However, there's no way you'd get 48 servings out of them, even in a 9x13.  In an 11x7 my husband and I each had dessert 3 times, so basically 6 servings.    The other problem I have with the directions is step #4.  If you're just supposed to sprinkle the chocolate chips and spoon the raspberry mixture on top, you get a lot of crust peeking through.  I ended up just spreading it all on top like a frosting, leaving some edge of the crust showing.  It looked pretty and evenly distributed the toppings.",

The crust is wonderfully buttery crumbly; when I baked the crust for the first 15 minutes it only browned on the edges and seemed a bit loose still but it turned out wonderfully. And the whole thing will solidfy a bit more once it cools so don't worry if it all seems just slightly loose after the final baking. Enjoy!",

I made it in a slightly smaller dish than the recipe asked so my crust was thicker - as a result I had to cook the crust 3 minutes longer. This recipe is going in my permanent file I will use it frequently & try different berries (blueberries blackberries etc). DE-LISH! Unfortunately these are far from low in fat - the butter & the chocolate provide plenty of fat - but well worth it!",
