It has the consistency of whipped cream. I can't see using this as a decorating icing. This was perfect for the cupcakes I made and the amount was enough to ice 26 average cupcakes. This is a perfect marshmallow icing and I sprinkled some coconut to half of the cakes. Thank you for this recipe. It was perfect.",
