Well, I've now made it 20+ times, and it's always what people rave about at parties.  It's amazing how good this tastes.  Most adults I know DO NOT like these dunked/topped with chocolate.  They taste good and have a classy look just as is.  Baking for 11-13 minutes seems to work better and don't get scared off by how dry the mix appears when you add the flour.  Will mix just fine... consistency of any cookie dough (butterscotch color & moist).  If your dough comes out flat, your baking soda has expired or you need to put dough in fridge for an hour.  As long as my butter isn't almost mushy from being room temp, I never have to put it in the fridge!  Two thumbs up and toddler approved!",

Baking is like a hobby for me, so after a little tweaking, I think I have created the PERFECT COOKIE for my family!  The changes I made were:\nIncrease the vanilla to 1 tsp.\nAdd 2 cups crushed corn flake cereal\nAdd 1/2 cup of toasted & cooled coconut.\nThen I made a separate batch and added white chocolate chips and OH BABY, they were to die for!  \n*NOTE* For those of you who said your cookies came out flat, I have a couple suggestions for you.\nFirst, check the date on your baking soda.  Also make sure it is kept stored in a cool pantry, cannot even be slightly warm.  Over time, heat breaks down the product long before the expiration date.\nSecond, cool your cookie dough in the fridge for 10-20 mins before baking.\nThen when you take it out of the fridge, roll dough into balls, then bake. These cookies should not come out flat at all. Happy Baking!!!",

These cookies are chewy and coconutty and really good the way the recipe is.  If you want your cookies to not flatten you have a couple of options: use margarine or shortening in place of butter; use baking powder instead of soda.  There is a great primer on cookie baking on this site that discusses fats and leaveners and their effects on cookies.  The cookies in the picture for this recipe that are in the container are representative of what the cookies should look like if you follow the recipe.  The ones that are stacked look different to me like perhaps margarine was used.  I doubled the recipe because it calls for teaspoon full and I use a tablespoon cookie scoop. That made 58 cookies of the batch and I baked them for 12 minutes.  The only ingredient adjustment I made was to double the vanilla to 1 tsp per recipe.  Yum yum.  Yes I will make them again.",
