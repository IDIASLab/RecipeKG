I was low on time these were my adjustments basically: Did the recipe for about 2.5 servings (about 5 cups tomatoes 3/4 celery stalk and a half an onion and 1 bay leaf). I was short on time. Simmered for about half an hour removed bay leaf simmered for about one more hour after pureeing. Add a little cream to the bowl for a completely different tasting soup. Liked it because it really framed the tomatoes without the normal basil pairing. Note: Pureeing is TRIVIAL with a stick blender. Just puree it in the pot. I use mine just about every day.",

I scaled this down to 4 servings and still had enough to fill my large stockpot! Scaled down I use 5 cans of diced tomatoes 1/2-3/4 onion a few stalks of celery 1 bay leaf and garlic salt and pepper to taste. I omitted all the extra salt and sugar. To simplify this a bit I just throw all ingredients from step 1 into my crockpot on low in the morning. By the time I get home from work it's ready to blended and sieved. I prefer the soup a little thinner so I skip the simmering step. I LOVE this soup and make sure my freezer is always stocked with it. I really hope you try it; it is WELL WORTH THE EFFORT!",

I used it as a base and added a splash of heavy cream 2 chicken breasts to simmer with it then shred diced mushrooms and tiny bow tie pasta. Just a hint when making the base: started by submerging the whole tomatoes in boiling water until the skin cracks then into some cold water - the skin will slough right off. Then cut them in half the \"round\" way so it is easy to remove the seeds with your thumb. This will cut out the step of straining your soup after blending... I prefer my tomatoe soup to me more chunky.",
