If you don't have the attachment, there are other ways to spiralize, including using a vegetable peeler. This recipe was inspired by leftovers. Before serving, top this dish with your favorite chopped fresh herbs! I love roasting 2 chickens at once and serving them for dinner one night, then cutting the rest up and using for several different meals. I freeze what I won't use in the next 2 days. I also keep a little packed away for Jake! Love my doggie...",

                "reviewBody": "Overall a very flavorful and healthy dish and a great way to use leftover chicken. What I had an issue with was the cook times stated. Most of the ingredients listed will take 1-2 minutes max. Cooking cherry tomatoes for the 6-7 minutes listed, and the zucchini noodles for 5+ minutes will overcook both.  Taking this into account, I started out by quickly sauteing the garlic for about 30 seconds, added in the cold chicken to warm up, then added in the rest of the ingredients all at once and cooked an additional 2-3 minutes til warmed through.  This dish comes together very fast, so make sure all your ingredients are prepped and ready to go! It's also very tangy - I only used about 2/3 of the lemon juice called for and that was plenty.  I will be making this again for a quick weeknight meal!",
