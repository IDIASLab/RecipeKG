We rolled dough to about 3/8 inch thick and cut into circles about 2.5 inches in diameter. Then let rise until again doubled in volume. Fry in oil until lightly browned on both sides. Let them drain/cool on a drying rack over paper towels puncture through to the center with a small thin knife and then fill through that slit using a cake decorator with a long thin tip. We filled some with raspberry preserves some with Marion berry and (at our daughter's request) some with marshmallow fluff. We sprinkled confectioners sugar over the top - rather than rolling them in it. Nothing wrong filling them with cheese. Happy Chanukah!!!",
