So by using just a bit more cornstarch and extra milk it was perfect and cut really neat slices. Cornstarch is unique in the way that when you bring to a hard boil; than boil for 1 min longer the filling is perfect. If you overcook it, it will go back to thin!!!I made this for my coffee group and they gave it 10 stars!",

The quantity that resulted was the perfect amount for a 9\" pie shell. The directions do not mention how long to stir, and for those of you who will make this pie in the future, you will be stirring constantly for at least 15 to 19 minutes, before the filling gets thick. It is important to stir constantly as the filling could burn. The flavor was a delicious chocolate flavor, and I topped the pie with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I hope you all will try this pie; you will not be disappointed.",

I think it's just personal taste as we are used to the pudding and pie filling flavor which is more chocolatey and less sweet and fudgy. That said the filling does set up very nicely and allows you to cut beautiful firm slices that look nice on the plate without falling apart. I used a stabilized whipped cream for the top and that worked perfectly - keeps for days without breaking down. One tip: when covering the filling with plastic wrap to let it cool without a \"crust\" forming on the top spray the plastic wrap with a little Pam and then wipe with a paper towel. Place the sprayed side down onto the filling pressing it right onto the filling. That way when removing it after it cools none of the filling sticks to the plastic wrap.",
