This is my favorite ice cream recipe because 1) extremely easy - only 3 ingredients 2) lower fat than most recipes 3) great base for fruit ice creams My modifications to the recipe: Use 2% evaporated milk instead of skim because ice cream needs some fat to churn properly. Skim is too skinny! Scale up the recipe to use three 12oz cans of evaporated milk (36oz total) and 1 1/4 cups of sugar. I use this recipe as a base for making fruit ice creams (in fact I've only made the vanilla once). When using 36oz evaporated milk I use 1 pint or 1 pound of fruit chopped (strawberry cherry) or pureed (blueberry banana) and combine with 3/4 cup of the sugar for an hour to create a fruit syrup. Then mix with the milk sugar and vanilla and churn. Awesome fruit ice cream! When made with 1 pint of fruit the recipe yields about 7 quarts ice cream.",

I used two 12 oz cans or 3 cups of 2% evaporated milk (following calamari's advice) 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1/2 cup of sugar in a 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker. I heated the milk first to make sure the sugar dissolved thoroughly. I just added a few extra spices this time nothing fancy. It turned out quite well better than expected. Coming out right of the machine it was quite light actually good flavor and texture. Not quite like full fat real ice cream I can see the comparison to ice milk but certainly tasty. I will definitely make this again and next time I'll experiment beyond vanilla.",
