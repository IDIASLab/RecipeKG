Yesterday I made the pear cake again but this time using nutmeg,it was good but everyone liked the first ones better (made with the ginger).  The nutmeg gives it a more spicy taste, with the cloves & cinnamon it's already \"spicy\" and the ginger compliments instead of overpowering. I will use only ginger when I make this cake, and I will be making these often too. :)  It's a wonderful, moist cake.  I baked it for 60 minutes.  Perfect!  This is a great recipe.",

I did halve the nutmeg and cloves because a lot of the reviewers recommended it and I was afraid I'd get a Spice Cake with some pears when what I wanted was a Pear Cake with some spices.  I was pleased with the balance.  Also, I think the 2 cups of sugar was fine, not too sweet and I used 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites(I hate trying to figure our what to do with 4 egg yolks!).  One thing I want to caution other bakers about, is that I feel my oven heats to a reliable temperature and at 60 minutes I felt like this cake was perhaps 5 minutes overdone.  Next time I will start checking it at 50 minutes even though some reviewers said that the hour and 10 minutes was not enough!",
