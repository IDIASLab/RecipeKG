For pork adobo, I usually use pork loin steaks, sliced or not. Brown pork in a skillet on medium high heat til nearly done. I've never needed oil to brown the meat. In a small bowl, mix 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1 2/3 cups water. Pour over browned meat. Season generously with garlic powder or granulated garlic. Add 2 bay leaves to the sauce. Cook uncovered on medium to medium high heat. The sauce will cook at a slow steady boil, and the flavor will absorb into the meat. You can save a little sauce or let the sauce evaporate.  I usually save a little sauce for the meat and steamed white rice. No need to use rub on meat. Do not add salt or pepper - it will be TOO salty! And no need to marinate. Chicken adobo is another recipe. Prepared correctly, adobo is a 5 star recipe! Family and friends devour it!",
