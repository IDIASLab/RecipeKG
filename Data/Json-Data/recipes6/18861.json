Add a tbsp. or 2 of butter just before you put the certo in...it keeps the foam down. Also I do not remove the seeds. Just put all the peppers into the food processor and grind finely. I do not stain...so the final result is more like jam than jelly. I boil for a few minutes after adding the certo...about 3 to 5 minutes. It 'jells' beautifully and is delicious.",

I did get more than one cup of juice but it didn't seem to make any difference in the preperation. When I added the cut up jalapenos I had to shake the jars several times after it came out of the water bath as it was cooling. If I didn't do this they all stayed at the rim and didn't disperse through the jelly. The color is great if you don't push it through cheese cloth just let it drip naturally. Thanks for a real winner!!ps  I just won 2nd place at the county fair with this recipe!!",
