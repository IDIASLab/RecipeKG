Along with his life-changing experience, he brought home a rich culinary repertoire that he incorporated into our family recipes. He passed away in 2016, and these recipes have become things our children treasure. They are part of the memories and fabric that keep his memory bright and alive. Here is \"ginisang sardinas\" which is a wonderful way to use canned sardines. This is usually eaten spooned over rice per each individual's desire/taste.",

The salty sardines were nicely balanced by the sweet acidity of the tomatoes and the white wine, and the fish sauce and tomato paste gave the dish a good depth of flavor. \n\nPros: Very quick, very cheap to make, easily paired with rice for a fuller meal\n\nCons: No real cons, but definitely scale recipe up if cooking for more than 2 people",
