However, that recipe was slightly different, calling for double the amount of butter/margarine (1 stick, or 1/2 up) and 1 cup of coconut.  Using that much butter helps to get it out of the pan (I never grease the pan, per the recipe).  Also, it had you prebake the crust for 10 minutes, and slicing the apples more thinly (which helps with making sure the apples cook all the way).  Fat free sour cream works just fine, and patting it LIGHTLY (the crust) into the pan is critical, as noted in other reviews.  It is important to watch that it does not overcook, as that also makes it hard to get out of the pan, while undercooking means it won't hold together.  It is really not hard, and it is fast and impressive.  I have not met anyone who didn't lvoe this dessert!",

Instead of Granny Smiths I used about 6 Red Delicious Apples and it turned out wonderful!!  Instead of using coconut because of the high sugar content, I added finely chopped walnuts to give it the same texture.  Even without the sugar and coconut, my family still found the dessert almost too sweet.  It was very easy and versatile!!!",

I greased and floured the 9x13 pan, and then I used a full stick of butter in the crust, patted lightly, and had no problem with it sticking to the pan.  I sliced my apples thin-ish (quartered the apple, then cut each quarter into 5). They were still thick enough slices, but thin enough to bake. And 3 apples was more than enough to cover the cake. I prebaked my crust for 10 minutes, then added the apples and sauce for about 30 minutes. Its a delisious twist on your standard apple bake. I think next I'm going to try switching chocolate cake mix for the yellow one, subbing raspberries for apples, and some cocoa powder or vanilla for the cinnamon. This recipe has opened up all kind of dessert possibilities for me.",
