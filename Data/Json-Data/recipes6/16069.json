Both times this recipe was made I liked but I didn't like the over abundance of the vanilla. 2 teaspoons is way to much you can taste it above the chocolate flavor and just under the peanut butter chips. However the 1st time they were made as a cookie and were thick and fluffy and were more like a cakey cookie. I suggested that we try on the next go around to place in a mini cupcake/muffin pan and see what they do. And to my thinking they did exactly as predicted...they were more a muffin style recipe verses a cookie. This recipe was good like I said but should be renamed as a muffin recipe not a cookie recipe. And as a muffin recipe they were perfect little morsels.",
