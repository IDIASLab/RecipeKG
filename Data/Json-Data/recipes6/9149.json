The recipe made about 36 taralli.  I added just a bit of fennel seed (1/2 tsp), and it flavored the entire batch quite a bit.  I also dipped half of them in grated Parmesan after boiling, but we could not taste the cheese after baking.  The taralli tend to be somewhat flavorless, which is actually good for a wine tasting...  I had to turn up the oven to get them to brown properly after the recommended  temp (350 in a regular oven) -- they spent an extra 7 minutes at convection 345 degrees, which did the trick.",
