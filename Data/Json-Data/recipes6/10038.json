I also used Almond milk instead of soy (because I didn't have that on hand either). I soured up my almond milk with 1 T of apple cider vinegar (and then added enough almond milk to make 1 cup--since I doubled the recipe). Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used stone ground corn meal and whole wheat flour reduced the oil to only 1 tbsp and added a couple extra tbsp applesauce. Made for a very healthy moist muffin. Next time I'll omit the oil entirely add flax and more applesauce. And these are not your typical tasting \"corn bread\" muffins. They reminded me more of a sweet bran muffin. Would be perfect for breakfast with a drizzle of honey. The second batch I made with 50/50 agave/maple syrup. Wonderful and a bit less sweet. Definitely making these again soon. Thanks for a wonderful healthy recipe!",

It is low fat low calorie vegan sugar free and sweetener free. As written this makes a delicious muffin. The first time I made this I didn't read any reviews and made the muffins as is. At he last minute I threw in some blueberries. I didn't realize that because of the 1 tsp of salt this makes a more savory muffin. They were still good but the salt and the blueberries tasted a bit off. The next time lowered the salt to a pinch added some blueberries and lemon zest. Next time I'm going to add some nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavour. I'm not vegan so these would also be good with some added cheese but it would defeat the health factor. These muffins are great because they can be made either savory or sweet. Just make sure to decrease the salt if you want a more sweet muffin.",
