I accidently purchased a container of curry coconut chicken broth thinking it was just chicken broth. Finding myself making chicken soup one day without my backup chicken broth I decided to give it a go with the 'mistake'. I added all that is in the recipe except the rice and bell pepper and sugar. It was the best tasting chicken soup ever. Nothing was overpowering as the curry and coconut is in chicken broth. I had many compliments from family. So delicious! and will for sure make again..",

Rather than add the chicken bouillon later I added it to the 4 cups of water in which the chicken was cooked (at this time I only had one large skinless/boneless chicken breast so I cut it in 4 to cook then diced it and strained the broth). I used butter to saut\u00e9 the carrots and onions. (I had no bell peppers so I added a diced fresh tomato just before the time to simmer adding a nice red colour). I used 1 1/2 c. cooked Basmati rice and hesitated to add brown sugar so I used only 1 T. of brown sugar Splenda. With the carrots and coconut milk in the recipe I'm not even sure the sugar is necessary. I used a red curry paste and garnished the bowls with a few leaves of fresh coriander (leftover from making the site's pineapple salsa recipe)! The family loved it! Being a Maritimer I think this would also be great with shrimp! I will definitely be using this recipe again... thank you!",
