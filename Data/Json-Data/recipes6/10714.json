I made a couple changes due to availability (I live in the UK):  I left out the pecan sandies and used approx 1 1/2 cups digestive biscuits crushed (no such thing as pecan sandies or graham crackers here).  My husband doesn't like lemony cheesecake so I added just a smidgen of fresh squeezed lemon (for that freshness taste), and about a teaspoon pure vanilla extract.  Besides that, we made it exactly as written (even with the sliced strawberries).  DELICIOUS!  I'll never make regular cheesecake again.\r\n\r\nThe second time, we decided to play with it a little and used 2 8oz blocks cream cheese instead of the 1, but left everything else the same.  It's even BETTER this way, in my opinion.  It tastes more like cheesecake and has more of a cheesecake texture (although it was delicious the first time, it had more of a whipped cream flavor and less of that cream cheese flavor).  We topped it with a bunch of randomly placed strawberry slices, fresh raspberries and blueberries.  So pretty and so easy!",

Also, I used almond extract and tangarine juice instead of lemon (I don't like lemon flavored cheesecake.) It turned out perfect and my husband (aka. the pickiest eater in the world\") loved it.",

I had just about given up on making my own cheesecake after battles with waterbaths, hours of baking and chilling but ending up with heavy, mushy cakes. I used 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 Tbsp of lemon juice at the suggestion of other reviewers. The combination of the graham cracker and pecan sandies crust was delicious and not overly sweet, but it did come out a little crumbly. Maybe more butter would hold it together better. Next time I think I'll add a little vanilla, but this recipe could be tweaked in so many ways. You can easily make it chocolate or marbled with cocoa powder, add a layer of chocolate chips or mix in fruit like thawed frozen raspberries. I would also like to try adding a flavor like kahlua, grand marnier or irish cream. Rather than freezing the cake with strawberries on top, I sliced them and sprinkled a little sugar on and let them rest so a syrup formed. They tasted great piled on top of the cheesecake with the syrup soaking into the crust. Yum! Can't wait to try some variations and share this one with friends!",
