I used 1 3/4 cans of evaporated milk to make it creamier added half of a brick of cream cheese (approx 4oz) salt black pepper cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I didn't have rotini so I used a box of linguini (boiled just to underdone so that it would not get overcooked in the oven)---peas corn. I toasted Panko breadcrumbs and topped it. It turned out really tasty. Pretty good for a 'nothing to make' kind of day. Thanks for the idea.",
