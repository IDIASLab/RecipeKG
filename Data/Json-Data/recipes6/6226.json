Don't be afraid to really stuff them because the cheese that oozes out is maybe the best part.

But even if they do look a tad rough, they tasted good! I used the grands flaky biscuits that DONT say \"buttermilk\" on the can, was super liberal about our mozzarella (inside & on top) and used garlic powder (not salt) and then used another poster's idea of basting the tops of each with a mix of melted butter and two tbsp garlic liquid that I got from the jar of minced garlic I had in the fridge. Cooked on convection for 11 mins and they came out great. Will definitely make this again!",
