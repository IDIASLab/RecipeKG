I like that it uses shortening (you can buy trans fat free shortening and then you can feel good about using it!) which atays room temp and there's no planning to it. Baked up wonderfully in a bundt pan cooled for 20 min. in the pan and flipped over. SO SO pretty when you cut it. Delicious flavor. I did 3 T. of lemon juice in place of the 2 T. lemon extract b/c I was out. Great recipe!!",

I followed the suggestion to reduce the sugar (3 cups seems like a lot even for the larger cake) so I added 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups as would be enough for a half recipe. Quite sweet good texture and the outside a little bit crispy as it should be. Don't make this if you're looking for somethine exotic but very good as a base for ice cream strawberries or any other topping. Thanks! My grandmother would be proud!",
