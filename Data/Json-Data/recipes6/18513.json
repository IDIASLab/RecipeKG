I will leave out the raisins next time and I think I'll add more sugar to make it a bit sweeter. Also I mixed the noodle mixture the night before and added the topping the next day just before I cooked it. This worked perfectly - although I added a few more minutes to the baking time. I brought it to a Seder a few nights ago and several people commented on how good it was. Over all it turned out good one of the better kugel recipes that I have tried.",
