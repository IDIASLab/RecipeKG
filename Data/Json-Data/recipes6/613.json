I did cut the ground cinnamon to 3/4 of a tablespoon because one whole tablespoon looked like too much for the volume...and that was a good call. I also added one cup of chopped walnuts and a few sliced green grapes and that took this recipe right to \"excellent!\" Everyone loved it and had seconds. Keeping this recipe for future holidays!",
