I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned & cut the sugar back to 1 cup. Next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar as it was still a little too sweet. My oven will not go to 325 so I baked for 75 minutes @ 350. It was a hit! There was not a morsel left. Everyone loved it. My father was scraping the sides of the pan to get all the crunchy/crispies stuck to the pan. My son asked when am I going to make it again. This is definitely a keeper",

I knew with our taste preferences some things needed to be altered and although I rarely do this on a new recipe I did make some changes. I scaled this down to 3 servings which then called for 1 cup 1 tsp sugar and I used 1/4 cup...you still could taste plenty of sweetness. I wasn t exactly sure what crumbled bread was supposed to be so I coarsely chopped the bread in my mini chopper (used 1 slice not 3). Finally I dotted the top of the casserole with about 1 Tbsp of butter (not 1/4 cup 1/4 tsp) and baked it at 350\u00baF instead of 325\u00baF. Don't skip that little sprinkle of cinnamon because it really added some interest to this hot tomato side dish. I know I know please don t judge me for making a lot of changes but I knew as written we would be disappointed. Modifying the recipe as I did resulted in a tasty new side that I will be making again.",
