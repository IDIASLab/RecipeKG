It is sweet & I could see how it's more of a dessert for many, but it added just the right balance of sweet with a spicy meal. All in all an easy, different & delicious way to use pumpkin. ",

I did not have evaporated milk so instead I used a can of sweetened condensed milk and just left out the sugar.  I didn't realize until just now that the recipe calls for self-rising flour.  I used regular ol' unbleached all purpose and it turned out great.  Didn't measure out my pumpkin, just used a 15 oz can.  I'm betting that you can even sub 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil for the butter and add some more of the traditional pumpkin pie spices if it suits you.  A word of advice, it is very delicious but a bit sweet for a side dish.  Might want to cut back on the sugar a bit for supper.  As is, it's great for breakfast.  All three of my kids loved it.",

The truth is that this recipe is quite versatile. I was going for side dish rather than dessert so I only used 1/4 c brown sugar. I also replaced 1/4 c of the butter with 1/4 c applesauce to make it a bit healthier. Then I popped it in the oven while I prepared the rest of dinner - very easy! It came out moist and fluffy (warning: the fluffiness doesn't carry over to the next day) with just the right amount of sweetness to serve with dinner. For more of a dessert feel I might use up to 1/2 c sugar - the pumpkin puree is sweet in itself. And you can top with marshmallows or whipped cream yum!",

On a second thought, I tried it again, but with my own twist:    First I 86'd the canned pumpkin and opted (since it is Halloween) for a fresh, medium, pie pumpkin.  I sliced it in half, scooped out the seeds (of course reserving them for toasting later), put the 2 halves on a cookie sheet with just enough water to cover the bottom and baked them in the oven @ 350 for about 45 minutes (as if making squash...yanno, because it IS a squash).  Then, once it was fully cooked and cooled, I quickly peeled it and threw it in a bowl for the next step.  Second: I got rid of the evaporated milk.  I could distinctly taste it in the first dish and well, it tasted like tin. Instead I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 skim milk.   I also used 1/2 c. sugar, omitted the salt, 1/2 the butter, and more cinnamon.    DELISH!  It was so light and airy and was like a mousse!  It was devine!  Still not savory, not too sweet but just right.    If you've never had fresh pumpkin before, this is a great recipe to try it in.  You'll never go back to the canned stuff!",
