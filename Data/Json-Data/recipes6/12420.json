They are even really good if you put them in the freezer (I forget how I figured this out), so next time we have a birthday at my house I am going to cook the two cookies, freeze them, put a layer of vanilla ice cream between them, decorate the top with chocolate icing and ta-dah!  I will have a giant ice-cream cookie sandwitch cake!  Someone else should try it (since I do not have another birthday for 6 months) and let me know how it goes!  When done baking I flip them unside down on a cooling rack and then flip them back over on another so they are right side up.  The presentation is great because, as I said earlier, they are perfectly round.  You can also half the recipie if you only need one giant cookie... or make two and give one to a neighbor!  Have fun!",

I have made this recipe 4 times and all times this cookie came out wonderful!!!  maybe this tip will help - I made the dough, used a 16inch pizza pan from walmart ($4) and lined the bottom with parchment paper - then press the dough into a ball in the center - place parchment paper on top and press slightly with my hands into a circle -  then i used my pampered chef rolling pin and simply rolled into a perfect circle - about 1 inch from edges.  i peeled off the parchment like a dream and baked - no spillage at all -  baked great, tasted great - looked professional!! thanks!!!",

I used a very large pizza pan (16 inch) that I bought just for making large cookies like this and that way when I spread the dough out (not too thick), I have enough room to allow the dough to expand. I top with store bought chocolate icing and the buttercream icing from this site because I found those two types closely resemble what the mall cookies taste like.   *Update* When I spread the dough on the pan, I add extra dough around the edges/side, because the cook will expand and as the cookie spreads, the edges will thin out and become more brown otherwise. Make sure to add extra dough just to the sides. Using a large pan and adding extra dough around the sides, I still have a little but of extra cookie dough leftover.",

I only had a 12 1/2 inch pan...so through trial and error had to take some of the cookie dough out so that it didn't overflow and start my oven on fire like it did the 1st time I tried it! Oops! I took about a cup and a half of dough out for the smaller pan. To grease the pan I used butter flavored cooking spray and it made the cookie even better. GREAT recipe - I've had it for a week and have made 4 of these cookies already for bosses (was a perfect gift for bosses day - all decorated) and friends! All got RAVE reviews! Thanks!!",

It looks funny (the texture is off - it seems like it is too lacey with air pockets) and doesn't taste quite right (again the texture is off and it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the homemade chocolate chip cookies I made a few weeks ago). I have high hopes for this though so I'll try it again and make some changes next time. This time I made these changes according to other reviews: only 1/2 tsp of salt and only 2 cups of flour. I thought the dough seemed too sticky. Also didn't use all the batter so I could leave a 1 inch border so it wouldn't overflow the pan. And used parchment paper beneath and on top of cookie for easy release - Baked at lower temp (325) for 27 minutes. NEXT TIME I am going to use the full 2 1/4 cups of flour and will use the parchment on the bottom but not on top. (I couldn't take it out of the oven until the top was cooked enough to pull that parchment on top off and by then I felt the cookie was done too much).",
