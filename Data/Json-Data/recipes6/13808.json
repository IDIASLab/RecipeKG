If it had any taste I could say it tasted bad but it doesn't If it had any life to it I could say it died but it doesn't if it had any sice to it i could say it is bland but it doesnt. So if you are looking for a tasteless no life meal that has no spice in it at all try this one.",

I do not agree this is flavorless. It makes me wonder if they are using fresh lime and fresh cilantro. Yes I do add fish sauce too. My kids love this version and I still get my \"Pad Thai\" I just add my authentic thai chili sauce from our local thai store to my own dish and it is great!!!! If you want real Pad Thai that is what restrants are for!",
