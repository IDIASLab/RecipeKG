I was tempted to make it vegetarian (for my BF's sake) but instead relented and added 2 breasts of chicken. This is the best soup I've made. I didn't have fresh veggies (except the asparagus) so I added some frozen bagged mixed vegetables (corn peas carrots lima beans) and a bag of stir fry peppers/onions. I think I need to make this more often.. Who wants to do my dishes?",
