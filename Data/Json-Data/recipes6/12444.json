So when I saw this recipe called for lard I was surprised that they still made lard but I went and bought it. I made them exactly like the recipe no changes. When I baked them all I could smell and taste was lard. If my mother in law gave me this recipe I'd be fighting with her and divorcing her son. I thought maybe the lard taste was just in my mind so I took one to a friend to taste and asked what she though she took a bite and said God it tastes like lard. OK so if you love the taste of lard and I can't imagine anyone that would you mike like these. Perhaps they'd be better if shortning was used in place of lard because the texture wasn't bad but unfortunately all I tasted was lard.",

I didn't just make cut out cookies I also used this dough to make a rasberry filled cookie. You roll the dough into ropes (1 inch thick length of your cookie sheet) use your finger to make an indent 1/2 inch apart all down the rope fill the indent with rasberry jam bake a little longer (maybe 10-12 min) and then drizzle melted white chocolate over the top and cut the rope into 1 inch pieces. It was by far the favorite treat. I also made frosted snowman cutouts that were delicous with this recipe I added a touch of nutmeg.",
