I used butterfly chops and browned them in olive oil for a few minutes, then sliced an onion and layered the slices in the bottom of a glass pan.  I put the chops on top of the onions and poured the mixture over them and cooked them in the oven at 375 for about a half hour.  The flavor was awesome and the chops were very tender.  I served it with spanish rice and a salad.\n\nMy husband is not crazy about pork chops, but he loved this!  Will definitely make again and might try adding some fresh herbs to the mixture since I love to experiment.",

I don't have a skillet large enough to cook 6 pork chops at one time so I baked them in the oven at 350 for about an hour. Before putting the chops in the baking dish I sliced a big onion & laid the rings on the bottom of the dish, put chops on top & pour the sauce over all of it.  When it was done I took the chops out, poured the onions & sauce into a pot & reduced it by half. The chops topped with the onions was so good. My picky boys even ate the onions.

Also to make the most out of this dish once the pork chops were done I took them out of the pan and added a bag of frozen broccoli and stir fried it for a few minutes..mighty delish. Take the leftover juice and add to top of pork chop if they seem dry. Be sure to adjust cooking time based on the thickness of the chop. Will definitely make this again. Thank you for submitting it. Oh one more thing...I used the Good Seasonings Italian Dressing in the package...instead of the 1/2 cup of oil the package calls for...I replaced it with 1/4 water and 1/4 oil..in addition to the water amount it already calls for.",

I also used lite dressing and soy... still yummy!",

The entire time I was cooking, I was afraid that the italian dressing would be too overwhelming, but it was perfect! The mix of dressing and soysauce evened out nicely.\n\nI did marinade the chops for an hour and added minced garlic to the marinade.  After panfrying the chop along with onions, I added the rest of the marinade. It came out so moist and delicious! My problem with chops are that they normally come out dry so this was fantastic!
