The icing stuck to the coconut mixture but the coconut mixture did not adhere to the chocolate base at all. It was really messy to cut. Perhaps with another can of Condensed Milk to make the coconut and almond mixture more gooey it would stick. Not sure I'll give this another go. I'm very sorry:(",

I substituted walnuts for almonds. I used a nonstick pan (un-greased) and subtracted 5 minutes from each cooking time. I did not find it messy at all like another reviewer did. I suggest using the nonstick pan - even the caramelized condensed milk scraped right off. I found an icing recipe on All Recipes and used that. I think this is a wonderful recipe and my bf (picky picky) wants me to make it all the time. Thank you this was perfect!",

Be sure to let this totally cool down before frosting because it will firm up and then frosting it will be very easy.
