We rented a house in Selfoss and the owner was gracious enough to stock the fridge with six containers. I m a yogurt lover and Icelandic yogurt (like Sigg s) is tangier than I think most of us in the U.S. are accustomed to. I typically don t like a lot of sweetness in anything these days but I would probably add a couple more tablespoons of brown sugar next time to compensate for the yogurt's tanginess. Gotta tell ya the muffin batter was really thick I was worried I was crushing the blueberries when folding them in and was concerned about how they would turn out. I almost added a little milk but I stayed true to the recipe and made no changes. Well they baked up into big beautiful blueberry muffins tender and moist with a pop of blueberry in just about every bite. Very nice way to start the day!",
