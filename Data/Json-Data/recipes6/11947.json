I laughed a little bit as dutch pastries are sometimes hard to make and me being a dutchie myself I thought I would see what I could do with this one. Im honestly not sure if this really is dutch or not honestly. Once I read what they had to say I took a closer look at the ingredients and measurements. This is a shortbread type of cookie which usually is on the crumbly or firm side. So you cant realistically bake this into bars and cut it without having crumbs. However I took one review that said to add in the egg other than brush the top of it and then instead of bars (for reasons mentioned above) I rolled it into cookies by hand and pressed sugar and almonds in the tops of the cookies and in about 25 minutes they were ready. Being that its a shortbread it doesnt really \"brown\" nor change color from dough to cooked form for that matter so when u can press the cookies and they do not give they are ready. I gave this one 4 stars after my alterations to the recipe. Hope this was helpful!",
