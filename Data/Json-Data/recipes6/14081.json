I think I will make this often and use it to serve with plain non-fat yogurt which will make a great snack breakfast or even a lunch. Right now I am eating it for lunch with plain yogurt and a cut up banana. Yum! It's very sweet and very thick -- I don't think I would eat it alone. Also for all you first-time makers: be assured that it thickens up ALOT as it is chilling -- you do not have to get it completely thickened by cooking it (you will be cooking forever if you try). All in all I'm very pleased with a healthy and tasty alternative thank you for giving me something that I would never have discovered otherwise!",
