I've fine-tuned this recipe over the years, until it matches any I've ever eaten at restaurants in Springfield. Here's the changes:  Take out the baking soda, and just add 1T Corn starch, 1 t. Lawry's seasoned salt, and 1/2 t. pepper to your flour mixture in a ziplock bag.  To the eggs, add 2 Tablespoons of ice water, then beat.  Dip your chicken in the egg, then the put in the ziplock bag to throughly coat the chicken, then lay the chicken on your cutting board for fifteen minutes to rest. After that, fry in the peanut oil as per original recipe and drain.   Changes to sauce:  To the original 2 cups chicken broth, change the Oyster sauce amt to 1 1/2 Tablespoons, 1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 Tablespoons corn starch. Heat all but the corn starch to boiling, then mix the corn starch with 1/3 cup of cold water until smooth. Stir slowly into the hot broth, and boil for one more minute. Put lid on and set aside.  Heat cashews only in the oven, for the amt of time on the original recipe, and sprinkle fresh, chopped green onions over the finished dish. Enjoy!  Teresa Merau ",

I've been looking for this recipe for 20 years since I went to school in Springfield - it is a perfect replica of the local dish. My own personal opinion is that this recipe does need to sit for awhile after adding the sauce to let the flavors meld more the next day is when I actually thought it tasted exactly like the local version. My only other suggestion is to add some cashews to the sauce when it is hot it softens these cashews up and lets the flavor of the nuts out. Then I still added more cashews right before serving to add the crunch. I've also made it with low sodium chicken cubes since the salt level in this recipe is very high and it still had great flavor. My son is now addicted to this and keeps telling me he wants to go to college in Springfield so he can have this everyday. Thanks for the recipe and the memories of Springfield.",
