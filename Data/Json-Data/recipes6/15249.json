I used 1 cup of creamed corn and 1/2 cup of whole kernel corn (from the can). I didn't put it in the food proessor. I also used Jiffy cornbread mix instead of the mexican cornflour and cornmeal. It turned out perfect! My husband can't wait till I make this again!",

I also used splenda instead of sugar. Total comfort food...corny carby goodness.

When I bring this to potlucks I transfer into my slow cooker & it's one of the first things gone. I haven't tried the creamed corn yet. My favorite frozen so far is Green Giant Extra Sweet Niblets Corn. One 1 lb. bag for a double batch. You gotta add this as a side to your Mexican meals!!! Yum!!!!!!!",
