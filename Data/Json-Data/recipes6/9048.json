Anyway, it does have a zingy taste b/c of the brown mustard and the italian dressing so it may not be for everyone. Personally, I loved it. I did try to avoid too much tanginess by adding about 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the breading mix. I would say this helped a bit. Mine were also bites because I had a rather giant zucchini to use up. I hope more people give this a try! I definitely will be bringing this to more potlucks.",

The zucchini was cooked perfectly.  I think I need more color of the bread crumbs when cooked.  I loved the faint mustard taste. I had to use plain GF bread crumbs so next time I will add some cheese, basil, or oregano, etc.   Just having something breaded that is so good when we are avoiding gluten is a BIG PLUS.

I cut 2 zucchini\u2019s into quarters, put them in a large bowl. Then I added the mayo. Next mixed them so that each zucchini piece was covered, then added a cup of plain bread crumbs, and a cup of fish fry. Again I lightly mixed until all pieces were covered, then I poured the zucchini into a baking pan lined with parchment paper. After leveling zucchini, I sprinkle top of zucchini with more breadcrumbs and fish fry (dry mix), put in oven on 400 for 30 minutes. Was a huge hit for my family!!! Came out crunchy and full of flavor.",
