It has a good flavor but called for spices I do not usually cook with. This might have been better if I used different spices my family is more used to like oregano parsley spinach flakes onion and garlic powder. I never added brown gravy dry mix to anything. This was very good. Next time I try it I will use the more traditional spices everyone in my household uses.",
