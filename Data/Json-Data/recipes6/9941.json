I had already fried some bacon so I just cut up 6 strips of bacon and added them to the peas and I added 2 tbsp of unsalted butter since I did not have any bacon grease left.  I microwaved the bacon.  Did not add salt only pepper. I thought 4 bullion cubes would be too much but they were perfectly seasoned. Use vidalia onions or a peru sweet onion for more flavor. For the ham I used left over honey baked ham and removed the honey rind and fat. I think I simmered only about six hours but they were a nice soft consistency.  A keeper!!!",

My parents would always just open a can of black eyed peas, heat them in the microwave and serve.. it's no wonder I hated them!  So I decided to make these peas and now I must say that I love black eyed peas!!  This recipe was awesome, the only changes I made was to cut it in half (I was only feeding 2.5 people so we didn't need a lot) I used 12 oz. of bacon because I didn't want to use just a partial package and I added a bit of garlic.  I also cooked it in the crock pot on low for 4 hours and then on high for 4 hours.  My husband even took these to have as a meal at work the next day.  I will never go back to canned black eyed peas again :)",

Cover peas in water and add salt as if you were salting them on your plate. Add sliced dry salt meat or smoked pig knuckles. Bring to a boil in a covered pot and reduce heat to a slow simmer. After simmering for one hour remove the lid and increase heat to bring it back to a simmer for 30 minutes. This is very important to allow the liquid to develop the color and rich flavor that really takes this dish from the mundane to the richness that takes it to the level of a culinary masterpiece.
