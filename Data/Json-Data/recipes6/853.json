I cut the recipe down slightly so it used a stick of butter. I ended up using 3 cups of flour and that was hard to mix in. I didn't roll out the dough but opted to roll into walnut sized balls. They flattened slightly but not much. I think they needed to be rolled in sugar. I think I ended up with about 3 dozen cookies. I don't think I'll make these again.",

Tried rolling them into balls and rolling them in flour and then flattening them just slightly with the bottom of a glass (but they don t flatten much when baked) like another reviewer suggested and that definitely improved their taste and dryness. These cookies need more moisture and to be sweeter. With some icing maybe they ll be ok. Definitely hold their shape: great for cookie cutters.",

It wasn't either too dry or too sticky of course doing it during the winter means the humidity was low which may have effected the sticky factor. Using a full bottle of Brier Rabbit molasses I don't see how it could ever be too dry. Using 3 - 4 inch cookie cutters it made about 6 dozen cookies. Using that size the baking time is closer to 6 - 7 minutes as I found out the hard way with my first cookie sheet. The cookies are very hard which is not the way we like them. I put a couple pieces of bread in the container which softened them a lot. As would be expected from that much molasses the taste is very strong. I'm not sure if I'd make them again for us but might make a smaller batch if I want a tray with lots of different kinds of cookies.",
