I baked my muffins for 17 minutes, and they came out great.\r\n\r\n--I made this recipe a second time and this time I used the juice from a whole lemon, about 2 tbsp more sugar, and instead of sprinkling the top with lemon zest I sprinkled it with a thin layer of sugar before baking. The sugar on top gave it a more crisp and slightly sweet top and the extra lemon gave it a fuller lemon flavor.

I also substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce and replaced the white sugar with an equal amount of Splenda. Lastly I added about 1 cup of blueberries to the batter just before baking. The flavour of the muffins wasn't bad and certainly not overly lemony...but the end result was a very chewy muffin that stuck to the paper liner. Not a bad start - but this recipe still requires more tweaking in my opinion.",
