I found this on Allrecipes 2 years ago and it is a perfect combo of pears and cranberries. I have made it for holiday dinners and never get tired of it. It is so simple and so good. Thanks Sue!",

My wife and kids liked it as well. I did follow the suggestions of others to cook in orange juice instead of water I also cooked the berries first and let them \"pop\" in the orange juice and sugar. I simmered them for about 10-15 minutes before adding the pears. The pears and the honey go VERY nicely with this sauce. Also my wife really wanted some oranges in the sauce so I chopped up an orange and added it when I added the pears. This was VERY YUMMY. I mixed up another batch for Christmas dinner too!",

He tried it along with another recipe and preferred this one hands down. I used Splenda instead of sugar and no one noticed. I used canned light pears instead of fresh and cooked the cranberries longer than recommended.... about 15 minutes. After refrigerating for a couple of hours it took on a jellied consistency that rivaled the canned version (which I love) but the flavor was far superior to any canned variety. This recipe is a keeper. I will be making it again at Christmas! Thanks!!!!",

I added about 1/2 c of chopped walnuts and replaced the lemon juice/zest with orange. It made the house smell lovely and tasted even better!",
