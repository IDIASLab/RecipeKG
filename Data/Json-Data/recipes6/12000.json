I kept the crust the same but pressed it into a 9x9 pan and baked for 10 minutes.  Then I increased the lemon filling to 1 1/2 times the amount in the recipe.  This gave me the perfect ratio of crust and filling!  Perfect balance of sweet and tart.",

I have made these Lemon Bars a few times now and love the outcome...I'm completely addicted! lol I did change a few things to make it more to my liking. For instance I baked the shortbread like crust for 15 mins instead of the 20 the recipe called for. I also added WAY more lemon juice...about 1/4 cup actually.:) My husband and I decided that we wanted more lemon taste. Thanks for a GREAT recipe that I will make all the time!:)",
