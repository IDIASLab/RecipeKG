If I were to do it again I would just add the flour and broth to the veggies let that cook until the taters were tender and then add the milk and let it thicken up. When I first added the milk it had a beautiful texture but broke up with all the simmering. I simmered at a low temp too. I used one Yukon Gold and one red potato. I used a mix of skim milk and fat-free evaporated milk and added a bit of both extra milk and broth. Omitted the wine. I cut the cheese down to 1 cup. It was very rich and creamy even with the skim milk. Served with focaccia bread.",

I didn't add it until right before I took it off the heat right after I added the cheese. I also did not add a whole cup and cup and a half. I used about a quarter cup or so just to give it a touch of creaminess. Next time I make this I'd use different spices I think. I just wasn't a fan of the spices in this soup but that's really just personal preferance. I think I'd add chunked ham too. Oh! When I sauteed the onion I also added a mess of fresh minced garlic.",
