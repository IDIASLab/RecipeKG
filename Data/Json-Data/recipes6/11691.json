I found that it worked best for me if I let it reach 300 degrees on my candy thermometer but I had to stir constantly to keep it from burning. As soon as I removed it from the burner I added 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans. I poured it onto an ungreased cookie sheet and quickly spread it out as thin as possible. I put five Hershey's chocolate bars on top and evenly spread the chocolate as soon as it melted. It does take the chocolate a long time to harden so I usually leave the pan for hours before I break the toffee apart. A spatula will lift the candy from the pan and then it breaks apart easily.",
