The only change I made was that instead of making the meatballs, I simply browned and crumbled the meat in a frying pan, drained the fat, then added the soy, garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9ed for another 2 minutes. We ran out of lettuce near the end, so we wrapped some of the rolls in rice paper wrappers, which was also delicious (and easier and less messy to eat). Next time I think that we will wrap them all in rice paper, and add shredded lettuce to the rolls. A must try!",

After rolling the turkey into ovals I flatened a bit before skewering with 2 wooden skewers to help make it easier to flip on the grill. We also added just a splash of rice vinegar to the dipping sauce (in addition to the lemon juice) and offered chopped cilantro and Walla Walla (sweet) onions in addition to the other add-ins. Sweet chili sauce is a mildly spicy-sweet Asian condiment that went really well with this dish. (plum sauce would make a good substitute) For added eye appeal we used a large round platter and lined with red leaf lettuce and placed the turkey skewers in a concentric circle on top. Dipping sauce was served in individual bowls at each place setting. It looked like a magazine spread! Great company dish since much of the prep work can be done ahead of time leaving you to enjoy your guests. I can't wait to make this again!",

I didn't think it was a lot of prep time considering it's a whole meal. I would have doen just as much if I needed to do sides as well. Low cost and low fat; with loads of good flavor. As far as other reviews saying messy; lettuce wraps are supposed to be. I suggest two heads of lettuce just to get enough of the big leaves.",

I pressed the turkey mixture into a casserole pan to a thickness of about 1\" and then turned it over and flipped it out onto my broiler pan so the grease would drip through. Brushed the surface with a little liquid smoke diluted in water and baked in 350 degree oven for 20 min. Cut in half to make it easier to flip it over and baked another 5min and then a quick broil to brown it. Sliced it into 1\" strips and served it that way. My family wasn't thrilled with the sauce so I made a quick peanut sate' sauce with a couple TBS Peanut butter water and milk to thin it down and a little splenda to sweeten it up. served with jasmine rice shredded carrots and zucchini as filling. They really liked it! I will make again but may try to use tortillas or crepes for the kids next time since they are not wild about lettuce.",
