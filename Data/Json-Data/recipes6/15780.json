I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 tsp. because I don't care for any hint of sweetness and because my bread machine doesn't like too much sugar either and has a tendency to over rise the dough! I do make a point to use the nonfat dry milk powder when a bread recipe calls for it as it is my understanding that there is something unique to the dry milk powder that helps with the rise and that produces a bread with a soft velvety texture. The science bears itself out with this bread. Great basic everyday bread to refer to over and over again.",
