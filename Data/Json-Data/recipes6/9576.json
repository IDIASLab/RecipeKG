Let the sauce reduce adequately before you add the meat back so that the meat doesn't over cook.",

I'd recommend leaving the salt out of the dish and putting a dash of Worchestershire in the rub. Also the steak can be cooked in less olive oil. I cooked fresh chopped garlic and shallots in the meat drippings before adding the wine to make the reduction. Excellent recipe and the mushrooms really grab the flavor of the meat and wine.",

I didn't have any fresh or dried thyme so I used 2 teaspoons fresh flat parsley and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano. I couldn't find my dried mustard (who knows?) so I used about 1 teaspoon yellow mustard instead. Because I was serving children and a husband who aren't fond of too much garlic I omitted the minced garlic at the end. Since the grill is covered with snow I used a grill pan on the stove and lightly coated the pan with olive oil. I can't wait to use this recipe for marinade on a better cut of steak as it is it turned inexpensive meat into delicious meat! I served atop fresh spinach leaves tossed lightly with olive oil garlic salt freshly ground pepper sliced tomatoes and a squirt of fresh lemon juice. I served oven roasted russet potatoes (in onion soup mix olive oil garlic salt parsley and pepper). Husband and children loved it. Thank you!",
