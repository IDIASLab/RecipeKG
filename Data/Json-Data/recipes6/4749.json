DBF really liked this but DS not so much. 4 servings might be understating unless this is meant to be the main course; as a side I would call it 6-8 servings. I served with homemade naan yum!",

Used cauliflower crumbles (1.5 lbs) rather than florets so my texture was different. In order to my it heartier I added peas and carrots as other reviewers did. I also added a can of garbanzo beans. Just a pinch of cayenne as we have no heat tolerance. Doubled the rest of the spices...used half when the recipe states and the other half the last 10 minutes of cooking. Served over rice pilaf I made with basmati rice and fried Mexican fideo noodles cinnamon and cloves onions ginger and garlic. And naan from trader joes:) all with a side of saute'd string beans.
