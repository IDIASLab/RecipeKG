I used a homemade version of a boxed cake mix instead of store-bought mix. The cake is nice and spongy. The brown sugar syrup is really good but I think it is too much. Next time I'll reduce the amount by about a third. It left the cake a bit soggy. I didn't use the cherries but simply doubled the pineapple. Definitely a good cake. Just how good depends on your level of sweet tooth!:-) Thank you qwertycook for your recipe.",

They were very happy with it. I used cinnamon instead of star anise and I replaced the vermouth with apple juice. Also my market didn't have vanilla cake mix so we used funfetti instead. It was pretty funny when I flipped it over and thought a green sprinkle was mold!! If I made this again I would use more liquid... Butter or juice maybe but I think it would be good with some additional crushed pineapple mixed into the cake mix. Overall very pleased.",
