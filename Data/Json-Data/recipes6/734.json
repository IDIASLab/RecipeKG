All of us LOVED this oatmeal and wished there was more for seconds. But there was not. Next time, I'll double it. Excellent for cold winter mornings.",

I would definitely recommend the rolled oats. I made 1/2 recipe and it made 4-5 servings. So the actual recipe written as is would make at least 8 servings and not 4. I microwaved it for 8 minutes and it seemed just right. Be patient it will take at least that long to thicken and the liquid to absorb. I sprinkled mine with the optional brown sugar and pecans. I definitely recommend them. I probably added a little more brown sugar than suggested. I then added milk to my dish as I always do with oatmeal.",

I think if I were to make it again I'd double the spices (except for ginger) skip the pumpkin pie spice that I had added add the 1/4 cup brown sugar and probably stick to 1 cup of pumpkin. The only thing that somewhat saved it was adding some chocolate chips. Still threw out most of the batch. The kids didn't like it either. I just don't think the combination is right.",
