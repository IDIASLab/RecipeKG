She baked a little birthday cake for my son with it shortly after and it was much better than the prepackaged mixes they sell for the oven.  It was moist and had really good flavor.  I substituted some bakers cocoa for the drink mix as kids usually prefer chocolate to lemon.  It was good and so much more economical.  Thank you for sharing.",
