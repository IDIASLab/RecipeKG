I held a viewing party with both this dish and Jackie's while your show was on and everyone loved your use of luncheon meat. It was nearly the topic of conversation. Also GREAT recipe for kimchi friend rice and love the twist of the pickled daikon and carrots. Pairing it with the perfectly cooked KBBQ sauce basted chicken is ingenious. Awesome job AWESOME show and looking forward to more delicious recipes coming from you! You need to write a cookbook.:)",

This is really good but I highly recommend using low sodium products where you can and even at that this is not one for those watching their sodium intake. It is not there in taste punching you in the face but it is there for certain. The only thing that would make this recipe better is an egg. Whether it be an over-easy over the top or a scrambled in the rice I think it needs egg. Other than that...perfect!",

It is a bit more work than the standard fried rice I normally make, which is typically just whatever is left over in the fridge, but it was worth it to get a little more kimchi into my diet. I\u2019ve been trying to do that for the health effects associated with kimchi. If you\u2019re into spicy Asian food, especially Korean, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.
