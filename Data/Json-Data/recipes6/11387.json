It's exactly like the one in an old Taste of Home issue. It actually ranked as a runner-up in their cheesecake contest so I decided to give it a try. The only alteration I made was to use crushed oreo cookies in place of the wafer crumbs because I didn't have any. Needless to say this turned out beautifully...and it being my first real cheesecake I was very proud of myself. Thanks for posting this Diane.",

Chill cake completely BEFORE spreading on top. TIP FOR NO CRACKS=use parchment paper for lining of pan (bottom and sides) to prevent cracks AND leave in oven for 1 hour prior to removing from oven once baked. TIP TO ENHANCE CHOCOLATE FLAVOR= a pinch of cayenne pepper. TIP FOR CRUST= if you have no chocolate cookies then use vanilla wafers, sugar, butter and cocoa powder. and lastly, I used 4 eggs....ENJOY ..you'll be a hit at any party !!!!",

It was easy enough to make (for a first-timer) and the end result was fabulous! I received rave reviews from friends and family (all chocolate lovers)! My only suggestion would be to maybe try another type of chocolate icing on top...I was very very hard after refrigerating it and it made it difficult to eat. (It did taste great though.) You should also note that the recipe doesn't mention that to make the crust you also have to add the 1/4 cup of melted butter to the chocolate crubs and sugar...(I think that part waas overlooked in the recipe.) Otherwise it was amazing!!!",
