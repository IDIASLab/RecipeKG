I used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon in mine. After mixing I let the dough sit in the bowl for 15 minutes before deep frying so the BP could work. The dough was nice and puffy even raw. Instead of dropping spoonfulls in the hot oil I wet my fingertips slightly and gently pulled the dough flat-ish. Much easier to cook this way. Not only do they stay turned over when you turn them, but you can be sure the insides won't be doughy like fat golf balls can be. I dipped them in a very thin glaze. I've already eaten 4!",

I found a couple tips: put a wooden handle in the oil and when bubbles come off of it the oil is ready to go. Make sure that you increase the temperature slowly so you find the minimum temp. at which this happens. It took a little adjusting but it was fairly easy. Also test a cube of bread...it should brown in about 2 min. I didn't use this method as it didn't seem very logical because bread is dry. I followed the recipe almost exactly (I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the mace) and found it a little sticky to form into balls but they tasted so good that I am hesitant to change anything. Make sure that your ball sizes are close to a teaspoon or slightly smaller; they puff in the oil. Basically these were a cinch to make quick and tasted delicious! Thanks for an easy recipe!!",
