Someone described it as a cross between macaroni salad and cole slaw - appropriate description. I decreased sugar to a little more than 1/4 c and it was plenty sweet. The dressing was fantastic!\nUpdate: I've made this a number of times since my original post and I've decided you could put this dressing on cardboard and people would eat it! I've yet to have anyone who did not like it.",

I admit being very skeptical about the sweetened condensed milk, but figured I'd try it, as I always trust the reviews here.  I eliminated the additional sugar altogether, as others said it was fine without it.  Although I liked the \"sweet-sour\" tartness to it, I wasn't sure about how others would feel. I didn't have the option to let it set overnight to let the flavors blend better, but found it still very good. I used red and yellow bell peppers, celery, hard boiled egg and chopped up some small shrimp; a sprinkle or two of dry mustard and paprika.   My daughter-in-law said she doesn't usually try macaroni salad, but she liked this one. This morning, my husband took leftover salad for his lunch and raved how great it was.  The macaroni absorbed any excess moisture and the flavors melded together beautifully.  HE LOVES IT.  Great compliment coming from a man who's mother was a terrific cook!!!   This has now become a salad I will make for EVERY OCCASION.",
