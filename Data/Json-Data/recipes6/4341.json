It's not a picky recipe either...I made a double recipe of it (large family) and had to substitute about a cup of the 5 cups of milk I needed with evaporated milk, soft cheese, sour cream, and half and half; plus, we were all out of swiss chesse, so I used two and half cups of Cabot extra sharp cheddar.  The results were delicious--my mom loved it so much she had seconds and even thirds!  \r\n\r\nSince I hadn't read the reviews before I cooked it, I was a little surprised about how peppery it turned out, but I didn't think it was TOO peppery, necessarily.  Anyway, this soup does take some time, but it is so wonderful that it's definitely worth it.  I will make it again in the winter, I'm sure.",

I was sooo leary about the swiss and as others stated it really is tasty in this soup in fact I wished that I had bought more so that I could add more. My 11 yr. old ate 3 helpings! I used skim milk added a few pieces of left over broccoli chopped & 1/4 c. of left over corn. I WILL make this again it was great! Thanks Marilyn!",

I had some leeks I needed to use up so used that instead of onion. I cut up my potatoes in small pieces not quarters and for six servings used just two rather large (baking size) yukon gold potatoes. Personal preference. I didn't have vegetable broth so used chicken broth. To keep soup from having a flour taste and from getting lumps I melted my butter added the flour cooked for about three minutes then added the milk. Let the milk heat a bit (but not to boiling) then after mashing up the veggies added it to the vegetables. That is the best way to cook this so there are no lumps. I used coarsely ground black pepper and I didn't have enough Swiss cheese only a couple of slices so I used up some other cheeses along with the Swiss: cheddar a white cheddar and parmasan. It was a great soup. Rates a five or more stores. Thick yes it is rich but oh so good.",

I have tried many potatoe soups and this is the one she ate! Aside form that I made a few substitutions. I used reconstituted dry skim milk a whole red onion (pulverized) and I used low fat swiss and cheddar. I think I may try asome dill havarti next time for a change.
