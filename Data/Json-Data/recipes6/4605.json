Other than having to adjust the times slightly due to the wheat this recipe was fabulous. The only recommendation that I have is that the water/broth from cooking lentils/legumes can add to the unpleasant after-effects of eating them so I used fresh vegetable broth instead. Thank you for this recipe - it will be a household standby!",
