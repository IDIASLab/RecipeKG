I was short an ear & supplemented with about a 1/2 cup frozen kernels & you could totally tell which ones came from a bag. I highly recommend using fresh. I didn't use the nutmeg cuz I wasn't in the mood but followed the rest to a tee & can't wait to serve this at holidays. The corn was the star & the shallots added amazing depth of flavor! Thank you so much!:o)",
