This tasty shelter-in-place salmon loaf is so good for you! While salmon right out of the can may not be the most appealing thing to look at, this salmon loaf is so delicious that we can surely forgive some of its visual shortcomings. Remember, looks are less important than personality (and taste!) and this easy salmon loaf is proof of that. Serve with your favorite tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, or hot, white cream sauce.",

The only other time I ever opened a can of salmon, I was so appalled by the bones and skin,  I  spent a long time picking them out. This time,  thanks to Chef John,  I mashed them right in and he's right--you cannot tell they're in there. The only change I made was to limit the butter to 2 tablespoons instead of 4. Per Chef John's suggestion,  I served it with a white sauce. I goosed the flavor of the sauce by heating the milk with a slice of onion and a bay leaf, then strained it into the roux. Added salt, pepper,  cayenne and a dash of nutmeg.  Oh, and because I was interrupted,  after it finished baking,  the loaf sat in the oven for probably about 15 minutes with the heat turned off, which may have contributed to the lovely delicate crust it had.",

Once again, Chef John did not disappoint!  This salmon loaf was really delicious. I made the recipe just as written, using lemon juice in place of the rice vinegar (since that type of vinegar is not a staple in my pantry).  The loaf turned out perfectly and had a very nice texture. I served it with a dill & caper white sauce, which complimented the salmon flavor quite well.  Chef John's video is also well worth watching - the tips are very helpful, and you can't help but chuckle at his humor.  Thanks Chef John!",
