I too left out the fennel (neither one of us like it), and used stewed tomatoes instead of sauce.  I seasoned the chops prior to cooking and left everything else exactly as the recipe said.  It will be on my new menu rotation!\n\nI would like to add that if the pork is tough, it was probably frozen prior to cooking.  Freezing meat denatures the protein of the meat and makes it tough.  I suggest that for the most tender and flavorful dishes, use fresh meat.  This is especially true for steaks, roasts, chicken breasts and chops (solid cuts of meat).  ",

I also added two cloves of crushed garlic while cooking the sliced onions. I also added a bit of Italian salad dressing while it simmered. Next time I won't add the water either, although it didn't hurt the taste. I made a side of rice, with green beans and bisquits.  Turned out great!",

I use 1 can diced tomatoes, juice and all, fill the tomato can with water, swirl it around a bit and add to skillet. Put 1 c. rice in a casserole dish; stir in the liquids from the skillet; top with browned chops and bake until all of the liquid has been absorbed - about 45 minutes.  This works well in a crock pot, too; add a second can of diced tomatoes and cook on low 8-10 hours.",
