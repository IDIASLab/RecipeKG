I used a quick rise yeast for the first time making Challah and a mixture of fine ground whole wheat (5cups) and spelt (2cups) flour. I never have white flour in the house. I also used honey instead of sugar it being Rosh HaShannah and had the intention of putting raisons and cinnamon init but forgt so put raisons on top of a egg/honey glaze. It wasn't as sweet as most rosh HaShonah loaves (thank goodness) and turned out fluffy and yummy and very very challahly. Yay!!",
