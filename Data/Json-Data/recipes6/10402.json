In any case you usually can get this at a carnival or fair with fruit topping or powdered or granulated sugar or something like that. The pumpkin was a subtle touch and if you didn't know it was in there you might miss it as the flavor wasn't very strong. I might add some pumpkin pie spice to get a little more flavor in them. The recipe as is makes a LOT of 2\" rounds and it could take you a long time to go through the dough if you use a small pan like I did so be aware of how many you need. I probably made about 40 with the original recipe. The dough was extremely wet and stuck to my hands so maybe I did something wrong. As I went along though the remaining dough dried out a bit and got a little tough to work with. I would say these are best when fresh out of the pan. After a day they are a little soggy but still very tasty. This is a good recipe!",

Mine didn't really puff up that well and ended up doughy in the middle (my fault though I'm bad at frying things). I added some spices and a dollop of molasses to addd some flavor but it didn't help that much (and probably helped the dough become even stickier).",
