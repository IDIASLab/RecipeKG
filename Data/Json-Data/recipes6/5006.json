I used red quinoa and ended up using up my chile and cayenne pepper so I included about 1/4 tsp. less of these seasonings which probably made it less spicy for us. If you want to tone down the spiciness you can add plain yogurt as a side and mix it in slowly. I also included basmati rice as a side. Additionally I sprinkled fresh cilantro on top to try to use up what I had left. I wish I had understood how to cut the carrots before making the recipe. Next time I am going to dice the carrots into small squares rather than discs.",
