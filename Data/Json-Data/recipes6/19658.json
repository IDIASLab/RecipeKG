There is a lot of chopping, but it's well worth the effort. The prep time depends on how quickly you can chop. We like it with vegetable fried rice or honey-garlic spare ribs.",

After a taste at that point, it felt like it was light on seasoning, so we essentially doubled the seasoning (added same amounts more of soy sauce, chicken bouillon, sugar;  EXCEPT no extra salt) AND added 1 tsp of garlic powder. (Will def try some fresh garlic next time instead of powdered; and considering using snow peas in place of green pepper or even bok choy if we can't get it.) Served with white rice and optional toppings of slivered almonds and crunchy chow mein noodles. A keeper for us!",
