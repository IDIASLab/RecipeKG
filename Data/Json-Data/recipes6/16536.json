When dropping them into the mini muffin tins, I used my small cookie scoop not only to make uniform sized muffins but it was just easier to make just the right amount for each muffin cup. I also used butter for the \"dip\" part, too. My family basically had these gone in a matter of seconds. Next time, I'll double the recipe and I think I'll add a little more spice when I make it and maybe some vanilla or maple flavoring to the \"puff\" part. NOTE: When you make these, be sure to watch them carefully as you reach the end of baking time. Mine were a bit overdone.",
