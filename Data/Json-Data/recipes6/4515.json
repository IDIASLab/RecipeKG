Relying on that experience I made a few changes in the ingredients and method of preparation. Agreeing with prior reviews I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. because it's naturally assertive eliminated the oregano basil and rosemary since it didn't fit the flavor profile and used canned stewed tomatoes. The powdered onion went too since there was plenty of fresh. I used minced seeded habanero chile in place of the cayenne and crushed red pepper because it's flavor works well with the other ingredients. I sauteed the spices with the onion celery and minced garlic which I doubled. To reduce the sweetness and highlight the sweet potato's natural flavor a bit more I made sure not to buy \"candied\" sweet potato. I used bottled roasted pepper since I had some left over from another dish. I also eliminated the water and used two cups of low sodium broth. Everything was partially hand blended at the end before adding leftover shredded roast chicken in the last five minutes of cooking for a protein boost. Tasty in front of the TV!",

I did make a few changes:Instead of roasting red pepper I cut red yellow and green peppers into chunks and sauteed then with the onions I substituted 1 can of stewed tomatoes for the plum tomatoes. I added 1 large minced thai chili pepper instead of cayenne. I added a little bit more cumin than a pinch (probably 1/4- 1/2 tsp). I simmered it for an hour to really bring out the flavors. I blended it with a hand blender for about 5 seconds just to make the broth a little thicker. I also sprinkled it with asiago before serving. Definitely a good recipe! This would probably make a yummy crock pot soup!",

I followed \"Big Rev\"s suggestions of reducing the cinnamon leaving out some spices saut\u00e9ing the spices with the onions adding chicken and skipping the water and using all broth. I still think there should be more broth so I'd probably go with 3 cups next time. I did not add the bell pepper (I am allergic) and I did not have Cumin or coriander so I substituted with a pinch of curry powder which has both in it. I also used a fresh sweet potato instead of canned (just simmer it 45 minutes instead of 20). I found in my store's produce section \"reconstituted\" black eyed peas (brand name Melissa s) which basically just saved me having to soak the dried peas overnight (I don t like the canned version). All in all this was a tasty dish and I plan to make it again for a dinner party in a few weeks.",

I just omitted some of the spices and per my dad's suggestion had some Hot Madras curry powder on the table so diners could season their stew to taste - the curry powder really did add just the right flavor. The spices I kept were the bay leaves garlic (fresh) thyme rosemary (fresh) brown sugar cumin salt red pepper cayenne pepper and parsley as garnish. I think next time I may substitute cilantro for parsley. I also just sauteed the red pepper rather than baking it to draw out the sweetness because I just don't have the patience for that. This soup is savory sweet and not overly complex with some spices omitted. Thanks to AMANDA1432 for submitting this recipe! It's brilliant!",

I focused only on the sweet and spicy stopping after the red pepper flakes but I did throw in about a teaspoon of freshly ground cumin. Being a cinnamon fanatic the amount didn't bother me but I do see how others would have found it overpowering. Nonetheless the soup was really quite good - I pureed it a bit and served it with some Greek-style yoghurt. Very tasty!",

There's too much going on with all the different spices; I think you need to pick a set of spices that compliment each other rather than using a pinch of everything. Also the cinnamon was a bit overwhelming. Will not be making this again.",
