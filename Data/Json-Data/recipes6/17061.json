The larger size is fun too. I made them to celebrate my daughters 4th birthday at school - I piped icing on (\"Really good frosting\" from this site). The kids loved them - (they all ate them as opposed to my previous experiences where I took cupcakes and they licked the frosting off and threw the cupcakes away!:- ) I scaled the recipe down to 26 servings and it made 15 large cookies. Thanks!!",

Growing up near the michigan indiana border I grew up with amish sugar cookies and can not find a recipe for them now. Could be the same but maybe when I cut the recipe way down I need to do some tweaking to it now. SO soft and sweet (I do remember the recipe calling for brown sugar so I cut sugar in 1/2 and subbed in brown sugar) They leveled off nicely for a drop cookie. I was worried with the first tray because my 3 year old dropped the cookies but they still turned out round and smooth. Great recipe!!!",
