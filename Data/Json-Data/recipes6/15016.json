Both times it was very tasty.  In fact, my husband has asked that I bake this bread instead of serving store-bought.  To top that, my sweet mother-in-law insisted on taking the second loaf home with her!  High praise indeed from a retired professional baker and a lady who raised a large family on homemade bread!",

I did rise an inch or two and that surprised me as I am used to having to use yeast. I baked it an hour and it came out well. I also used no whole wheat flour as I didn't have any on hand so I used all all purpose white flour from hodgkin's mill. I also had to sub rice syrup for the sugar as I cannot have sugar. I also had no buttermilk so I sub full fat plain yogurt. It turned out great butter on top made it awesome. It was almost sweet without being too sweet and very dense. I will make this again soon!!",
