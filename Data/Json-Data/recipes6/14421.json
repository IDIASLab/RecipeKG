I just looked up other Passover Roll recipes on line and they were about the same as this with one tablespoon of sugar instead of 1 teaspoon. I think that is probably more to my liking. This is definitely worth making but I am definitely adding more sugar next time. I also only needed to cook it for 50 minutes and that was a little bit too much. I would set your timer for 45 minutes and watch closely. OK I made them again today and added the sugar and it was great!!! I added a little more than a tablespoon and the rolls taste like funnel cakes. My only complaint is that I used extra large eggs this time and it was too much egg for me. It made the inside like a kruller doughnut. Although that sounds good it was so airy it was like their was nothing there. This is my last update I promise!! I froze both batches of rolls I made and defrosted them the day off. In the second batch with extra sugar and extra large eggs the airy quality of the center was toned down a ton. It was perfect and moist. The first batch was slightly dry to me. Everyone raved over them. They were a huge hit.",
