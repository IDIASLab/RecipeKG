I did make a few minor changes. I had some carrots that were shredded and needed to be used, so I added them to the onion/apple sautee. Also, I used turkey italian sausage intead of traditional, because I prefer it. Since turkey has less fat, I needed to augment the droppings with a bit of chicken broth to get a gravy. I will definitely make this again!",

Also, since everything is already cooked, and it doesn't really need to bake other than for browning the potatoes, I'll probably broil it in the oven, for about 5 minutes.  Very yummy dish, and definitely a keeper!",

I did saute some diced red pepper with the onions, and made the gravy with chicken broth because I didn't have any beef broth. But next time I make this I will be more prepared and make sure I have those items on hand. However... my guys were very happy (husband is Irish, lol) and were excited about taking the left overs for lunch the next day, so a 5 star recipe this is!! Thank you for this one, NikkHoff!",
