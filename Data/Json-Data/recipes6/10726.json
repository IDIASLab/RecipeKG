This recipe isn't very specific about how much you should beat the ingredients which is really important for the texture! Mine came out WAY too dense (didn't beat enough?)... I also used large eggs and it was WAY too eggy. The sweetness was good just right not too sweet but I could still taste the baking powder (I used 1tsp). Overall the amount of ingredients is right (for 3 small eggs) but this recipe should give more directions than just 'mix everything until combined'. Also definitely do the variations because it's rather bland even with the vanilla.",

As a previous reviewer posted - so easy to modify and play with:) The modifications I made were as follows - 1) I used homemade yogurt which has the consistency of Greek yogurt 2) Instead of the 1 C of white sugar I used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar 3) I substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil 4) just as a note - 0.25 oz yeast = 2.5 tsp yeast which I used. 5) For additional spice I added 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/8 tsp cloves. For aesthetic appeal I spiraled honey over the batter (which is quite thick so the honey doesn't sink in or anything) and the finished product had a pretty top:) Lots of changes but it turned out great!",

I added cinnamon vanilla and ground cloves as well as replaced 1/2 the sugar with packed brown sugar as another reviewer suggested. I will say that the yeast in this recipe IMO serves no purpose because a yeast needs time to activate. The next time I make this I will replace the yeast with 1/2 t. baking soda that will react with the yogurt to create pockets of air and give this recipe it's cakey-ness.:)",

I used 2 eggs instead of 3 added a little vanilla used 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of yeast and split the 1/2 cup vegetable into 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup margarine. I also added the zest of a lemon and it turned out a wonderfully light lemony dream. To make it into more of a dessert I made a lemon glaze by heating a tablespoon of margarine a tsp of vanilla and the juice of the lemon I zested over low heat. Then I dumped in a bunch of confectioner's sugar until I got the consistency I wanted. I can't wait to try other versions of this recipe! Maybe next time I'll add dried cranberries or cherries and almond slivers...",
