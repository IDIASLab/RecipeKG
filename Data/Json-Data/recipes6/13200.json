I read through the other reviews and took the advice of a few others. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, used rice vinegar, put 3/4 t of sesame oil in and put the 2 seasoning packets from the ramen after the dressing cooled. I also mixed everything in 3 separate containers and mixed just as much as we ate for dinner - good idea! I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro, 1 large can of mandarin oranges and 1 can of chopped water chestnuts to the napa cabbage for a little more flavor. It turned out great! We are having this again very soon. THANKS!",

My only complaint (but will modify for future uses) is that it says \"cool\" the sauce mix when really I think that it would taste better chilled (apprx 1 hour?) before pouring over the salad. I also used the pre-packed/pre-shredded cole-slaw mix which saved on time. Next time I will either buy a bigger package of the slaw or use one and 1/2 bags so that the oil mix doesn't create \"soup\" at the bottom. Finally I think I'll also add half chopped green bell pepper. Overall we loved and will make again.",

I also cut down the oil to 1/4 cup and may try cutting it down even more the next time I make this.  Tasty salad, all around, although I am still searching for ways to make this a bit healthier, maybe add more cole-slaw mix to give it more bulk.  I used one bag of pre-prepped cole slaw mix and thought it was a lot of slaw.  But once you add the ingredients and start mixing everything, the volume shrinks down quite a bit.  So again, maybe adding an extra bag of slaw, cutting down on the oil, upping the amount of vinegar and soy sauce, and omitting the butter may make this somewhat more healthy.  Oh, and I did add the seasoning packet that comes with the ramen, that added extra flavor.  UPDATE:  I still had tons of leftovers from when I made this a few days ago, so I added another entire bag of pre-mixed slaw, and again, it seemed like a lot, but when you mix it, the volume shrinks down.  Definitely just as tasty.  I will always use 2 bags the next time I make this, or, just use one bag of slaw, and just one package of ramen and cut out the butter and cut down on the oil as I had mentioned earlier.",
