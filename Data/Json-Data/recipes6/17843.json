Also pureed fresh strawberries sweetened with more Splenda and a dash of Grand Marnier and served on the side as a fresh compote-type sauce (see picture) which helped the presentation. ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS RECIPE DOESN'T CLAIM TO BE NY STYLE CHEESECAKE I found it to be nothing more than a wannabe. So sorry but it's hard to get all excited about this one. A Jello cheesecake mix scores higher for flavor and texture. I had expected a whole lot more from reading previous reviews. I found its main virtue to be that it's easy although truthfully not all that much easier than making the real thing. I won't be making this again because to me I'd rather spend the very little extra time to make the real thing which always yields spectacular results even when substituting Splenda for the sugar. This dessert was so aggressively mediocre that we didn't eat anymore after trying our first slice - we ate the strawberry coulis over fruit salad since that part was wonderful but the rest got thrown out. To make a long story short it's passable at best.",
