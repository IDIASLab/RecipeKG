Interestingly there is no cashew flavor while eating it but there is a strong cashew aftertaste. Nice gluten free recipe with a perfect \"cookie crumble\" to it. In fact I've substituted this mix of tapioca/corn/potato flour directly for wheat flour in other cookie recipes and they've turned out great (albeit with a slight corny flavor).",

I also added about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and a cup of chocolate chips! They were great and chewy you can't tell these are wheat free!",

My son and all their friends (and okay me too:)) scarfed most of them down yesterday so I think I am going to make some more today! The cashew taste was very subtle - though I added chocolate chips which probably added to that. I think I may make these sometimes with all peanut butter for the nut butters and then another time with all cashew butter. I bet almond butter would be great too and they'd be good with or without the chocolate chips.",
