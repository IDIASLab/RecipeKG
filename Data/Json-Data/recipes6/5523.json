The soup itself is tasty but (as pointed out by another reviewer) it's not that pretty. Although I did cook it for the recommended time I didn't add the broccoli until the last half hour. I added a handful of frozen peas and carrots that needed using. If I make this again I would cook the chicken separately (or just use leftover chicken) and throw it in near the end. Cooking the chicken from a raw state is part of what makes it \"not so pretty\" - the length of cooking time is the other. This soup could do with a much shorter cooking time. I did add additional boullion for a little more flavor. I also used frozen mixed peppers because I had them on hand.",

This is great recipe to use up whatever veggies you have in your fridge or freezer. I used red instead of green peppers and added green zucchini that I sliced into round slices and cut each into quarters. I also has an open can of chicken broth that I used in conjunction with the water and bouillon cubes. Will definitely be making this again!",
