Then it was my featured dish at a huge family reunion, and though I'd made 175% as much as I thought I'd need, I found that I had to quickly thaw out what I'd frozen up the day before in order to satisfy the crowd. It was that good!! HINT: I found that serving is best with a leaf of lettuce on the bottom bun, which keeps the juices from softening the bun too much. Otherwise, don't change a thing. This recipes freezes well also. And incidentally, I didn't stand a chance of keeping this recipe a secret.",

I added more vinegar Worcestershire sauce (used worcestershire for chicken rather than regular worcestershire) 1/4 cup of tomato sauce 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce and a little bit of water and simmered that for about 25 minutes. The meat was so tender and full of flavor. I will probably use the meat for many recipes in the future not just sandwiches. Thanks!",
