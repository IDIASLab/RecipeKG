Left my soup in the crock-pot for the afternoon and by dinnertime, it smelled sinfully-good. I love that it was so colorful, and almost wouldn't have minded even more veggies, but this soup was great, and the cook's notes at the bottom are very helpful too. (I also froze half for another night, but truthfully, I wouldn't mind having some leftovers in front of my face right now.)",
