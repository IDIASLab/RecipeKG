The lemon juice serves to keep the pepper flavor bright and of course roasted garlic is a perfect complement to peppers. Be careful out there with the fennel if you are not fond of anise/licorice (we love it but it should be a supporting note not the melody!). Leslie you suggest that we use home made vegetable stock rather than canned if possible; I concur - it would have been great to have had YOUR vegetable stock recipe to work with (I'll look for it under broths/stocks in All Recipes). I took the liberty of using fresh minced lemon and french thyme from my garden in place of the dry thyme the recipe calls for used sea salt to puree some fresh garlic to use (in place of the garlic salt which I find can be a bit acrid) and added the luxury of a few drops of a very good extra virgin olive oil to garnish along with the reserved julienned pepper. Thanks for a visually appealing as well as tasty addition to my soup recipe collection! Cristen G.",

I let the broth reduce down a bit in order to thicken it up into a stew. I generously splashed lemon juice over the peppers instead of using a lemon and left out the fennel. It tasted fabulous. My husband LOVED it - and he is usually a skeptic with new things.:) I cut about a 1/4 of the peppers into large 1 inch pieces and it made it really thick and chunky which we loved. Less of a soup and more of a thick wintery stew. Perfect for cold nights!",

I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of fennel seeds just to use 1tsp in this recipe so I used a star anise instead. What I didn't much like about the recipe was the very watery texture. If I was going to make this again I would double the amount of peppers and probably cut back on the broth too. Anyway with a nice thick slice of Viennese bread this made a light but comforting lunch on a very wet and stormy day. Thanks Leslie!",

I pretty much pureed then as much as I could (I wanted it that way) and added lemon juice and olive oil. The color is great and it had a very strong flavour. I wish there was more!!!",
