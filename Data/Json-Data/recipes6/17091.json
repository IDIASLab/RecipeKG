The recipe I usually use is a little different than this one but what a difference a few changes can make.  The filling is nice and firm, the crust moist and the topping not too hard!  It cuts into squares excellent (I line my pan with parchment paper so it's easier to get out of the pan and cut.)  The top doesn't crack when you're cutting it and the filling doesn't squish out the sides and the bottom stays together nicely.  This is my new Nanaimo bar recipe that I'll be using from now on!! Thanks for the great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is one of the BEST desserts I have ever made. I had 20 of my husband's co-workers over for tea today, and every single one of them asked me for the recipe. I had catered goodies from a local bakery, yet nearly everyone bypassed those treats for this homemade one. We recently returned from Vancouver where I tried these bars for the first time and fell in love. They are delicious. FIRST TIP: Use \"digestive cookies\" instead of \"graham crackers\" to make your crumbs. Graham crackers are sweet, whereas digestives are a little saltier and crunchier -- yum yum! SECOND TIP: Use custard powder (you can find Bird's Eye Custard Powder at Cost Plus and in the British Foods aisle of many specialty grocery stores). Instant vanilla pudding mix is too sweet! Custard powder is just corn starch with some flavoring and coloring and salt, but it gives you the perfect texture, taste, and look. Don't use anything else. THIRD TIP: Be sure to use almonds which you have ground up in the food processor (where I also grind up the digestives). FOURTH TIP: You'll probably want to double the recipe because these go fast. FIFTH TIP: Be sure to read \"the most helpful reviews\" for how to avoid curdling/scrambling the eggs when you add them to the hot chocolate mixture. The tips worked like a charm for me!",

I did not have an issue with the eggs curdling, maybe because my double boiled mixture was not overly hot.  Perhaps the coconut could be reduced to 3/4 C next time.  But my non-coconut friends even liked these.  We do not have custard powder around SO...I did some research and I was pleased with how they turned out.  DO NOT USE VANILLA pudding.  Custard powder is NOT pudding.  Simply substitute 2 TBSP of cornstarch and vanilla.  I had vanilla powder, so I used a tsp of that.  I also only used one cup of p. sugar.  It was the right sweetness but I wish there was a little more of that layer, so next time I might try two cups of p. sugar, if that is too sweet, than I will add another stick of butter to increase volume.  Used semi-sweet chips for topping.  Turned out beautifully!  Can't wait to make these when it's too hot this summer to bake.",
