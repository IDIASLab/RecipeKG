I used BOTH hands to wipe my face after deseeding the habaner\"o\"s and all hell broke loose. My face and eyes felt like they went up in flames. I wailed and wailed so that my family called poison control in a desperate attempt to bring me some relief. During the ruckus, I lost the fresh thyme. Without it, the wings were smashing, but there was a hint of something missing. The fresh thyme would have likely made the wings stunning. I was concerned that three habaneros would be too hot, but the lime juice does a wonderful job of soothing the habaneros to just the right amount of heat (after cooking). I used 4.5 pounds of mostly flats and some drumettes. There was enough marinade to cover each piece of chicken well without doubling. The flats were better tasting because the coating over the smaller pieces allowed for more flavor per bite. I let 3 pounds marinate overnight. The other 1.5 pounds did not marinate. Definitely marinate if you can, if not, it's OK as much of the flavor comes from the caramelizing as they are cooking. Let them cook 'til they're good and dark. Too little and the flavors won't pop! Be sure to use every bit of salt that the recipe calls for and maybe a bit more. All said, I'm putting these in the weekly rotation for a bit AND buying gloves to use when deseeding the habaneros.",
