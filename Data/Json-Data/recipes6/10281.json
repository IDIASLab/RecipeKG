The only thing I did was half the recipe as it was just me enjoying it! I want to THANK Doug Matthews for putting me onto this recipe! I am simply bowled over by how good it is!!! (Thanks Doug!) Note as per another reviewer the entire batch will not fit into a 9x9 pan I used a 9x9 but HALVED the recipe and it fit perfectly so you will definitely need a larger pan if making the batch as stated in the recipe. Next time I am making muffins though - mmmmmm this really is a yummy savoury cornbread that I am glad was given to me!;) Edit I made these again (March 30th) but baked them in muffin tins if anyone is contemplating that it took 15 minutes for mine to be done OMG still the same awesome taste!:D Clear winner here of a recipe...:)",
