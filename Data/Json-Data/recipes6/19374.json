I made a few alterations tho': I prepped the eggplant by \"sweating\" it out with sea salt(see Eggplant Parmesan II review for instructions). When I added the canned tomatoes I also added 1/2 cp of red wine as well as oregano fresh basil and fresh parsley(add these 3 to taste). I then allowed it all to simmer for an extra 20 minutes. May add carrots next time I often use them in my regular pasta sauce--helps with the sweetness factor & you won't need to add sugar.",
