I used the \"lite\" version of Tony Chachere's as my creole seasoning.  It is lite on salt - not on heat!  I am making a double batch of the sauce this time so I'll have some extra  for rice.  I will not double the creole seasoning, however.  I like things spicy but it was a kicked up a little high for me.  If you are making it for the first time I would advise starting with half of the tablespoon-- you can always add more!\nThis recipe does not disappoint.  Thanks for sharing Janell.",

While the fish was cooking, I tossed a spring greens salad with balsamic vinaigrette, which was an excellent complement to the rice and the heat of the fish. Bust the fish wasn't the star it should have been. It was my fist time cooking Mahi Mahi and it seemed a bit bland, despite the Cajun spice. I will give it another try with different fish and see how that works for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",

My grocery store generic is way too mild for this, so I usually toss in a little cayenne pepper.  I don't always like spicy food, but something about the mix of the sweet and the spicy just hits home for me.  I definitely recommend this recipe, just remember that a lot depends on which cajun seasoning mix you use.  But even with one that's too mild, it will still be good fish.",
