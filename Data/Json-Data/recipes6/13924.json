I served it on each dinner plate on a couple Bibb lettuce leaves rather than lining the serving bowl with lettuce. The dressing was flavorful but could easily have been doubled and would have been better. Fresh dill is a key. It is nice that this recipe can be prepared in advance and refrigerated while working on the rest of the meal preparation.",

I had to doctor it up bit since I didn't have a dijon mustard I just used yellow mustard. I also cut the amount of oil and added some basalmic vinegar in addition to the white wine variety. However the basalmic gave it kinda of a funky color so I added some fat-free sour cream and turned it into a creamy dressing with lovely yellow color -- will definitely make again!",
