Next time I would make more streusel so that the layer of it is more pronounced and add more flavor. I gradually added streusel to the top of the cake as it baked so that the sugar wouldn't burn. This made a really nice crust to the cake. If doing this may need to increase the cooking time slightly due to the opening of the oven. Let it cool for few hours before cutting. Wouldn't recommend baking this the morning you want to serve it because it won't cut nicely and makes for a sloppy presentation.",

When we ate it it was dry. The sugar cinnamon and nut mix did not bake into the cake at all. The nuts on the top burned and the sugar poured off when I removed the cake from the bundt pan. Should it have been mixed with some melted butter? I was very dissapointed and embarrased to have served this to my husband's co-workers!",

As suggested by other reviewers I doubled the streusel filling and divided the batter into thirds so there was 2 rows of it running through. It needed to be baked for 65 minutes and was done perfectly. Let it cool for about 10 minutes and when I flipped the pan it came right out. This makes one big bundt cake but it is really good!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a classic coffee cake similar to what my late mother used to keep on hand for guests but the recipe needed some help. First I baked this in a flat-bottomed angel food type tube cake pan (the closest modern equivalent to my mother's tube pan w/ straight 3-1/2\" sides that was designed for streusel cakes). I covered the top w/ foil for part of the bake time to prevent the streusel from burning. This way the cake is turned out upside down but is then inverted again so that the streusel is back on top. Fluted cake tops can't show the streusel and the batter is less likely to run over in a taller pan. I made the cake as written except for using lowfat sour cream but w/o salt (almost 1 tsp) there is the \"flat\" taste some reviewers mentioned. When a baking recipe calls for butter but doesn't specify what type the convention is that it means unsalted butter. Perhaps the submitter uses salted butter or margarine so she didn't include the necessary salt in the recipe. If you use supermarket vanilla extract (and not extra-strength gourmet extract) the amount of vanilla should be doubled. Streusel sticks better if it includes a bit of butter. My batter came out too thick to spread well in the pan and the cake was more oily-textured than I like. One solution to both issues is to sub in applesauce for half the recipe's butter. However the recipe was a great starting point to recreate my mother's classic.",
