There are some differences and tips I can share: Heat your oven to 325, Boil your margarine, butter and sugar for only 2 minutes; remove and add 1tsp of vanilla. Pour ontop of HONEY graham crackers on a lined jelly roll pan (makes removal easier if you use parchment paper). Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and bake in heated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, NO MORE. Easily over baked and/or over boil so these times are important!",

I read someone sprinkled chocolate chips on top might try that too!!!",

You have to be sure to melt the butter over a lower heat and not cook the mixture too long. If the syrup isn't the right consistency or if you burn it over high heat the cookies aren't as good. Try it a couple times and you'll figure out the right temperatures and cook times. It's been different for me each time I make these but I've learned what the mixture should look like to turn out correctly.",
