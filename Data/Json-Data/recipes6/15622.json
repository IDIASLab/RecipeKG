You do need to mix a little of the hot milk mix with the egg to avoid bits of cooked egg. I also had bits of hard dry bread on the top like maybe I used too much? I also made a quick sauce of caro syrup maple syrup some spiced rum and some butter which I poured over the top. This helped with the dryness. I will absolutely make this again.",

I cut back the number of bread slices to 12 because I like more of a \"custard\" based bread pudding. I used Ezekiel frozen cinnamon raisin bread that I toasted a little to thaw and the taste was wonderful 2.) I used half brown sugar/half white sugar for the sugar and cinnamon sprinkled over the cubed bread. Next time I'm going to try just 1/4 c brown sugar with the cinnamon because it was a little too sweet. 3.) Instead of raisins I used dried blueberries. They have so much flavor and made for a nice tart contrast to the sweet bread. 4.) I used my corning ware with a glass lid instead of plastic wrap in the microwave. I served it with homemade whipped cream and my guests finished the entire dish. Thanks for the great idea of making this yummy classic in the microwave.",
