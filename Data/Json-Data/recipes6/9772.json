I have one \u201cgo to\u201d recipe that is a sweet recipe using them and now dare I say, I have 2!! This was a nice treat.  Super easy and it baked up while  we were eating dinner.  I didn\u2019t get fancy with the piping bag.  I rolled out the dough and separated the triangles and used a spoon to smooth the Nutella on.  It was about 1 tsp for each.  I think the. 1/4 C ratio is perfect.  We tried them hot out of the oven, room temp and cold.  We liked room temp and cold the best.  This was so easy and super good!!  (I\u2019m told I have to add marshmallows to them next time. )",
