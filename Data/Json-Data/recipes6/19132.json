I also used vanilla extract instead of almond (that's what I had) added a sprinkle of lemon juice to the fruit and added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the topping. I think I might try replacing some of the flour with oats as some suggested - I forgot until after the flour was measured. Thanks for this! Super easy super delicious.",

I replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 cup rolled oats, decreased white sugar to a little over 1/2 cup and increased brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used 3/4 teaspoon Penzey's Vietnamese cinnamon, which is really sweet.  Left butter at 1/2 cup and rubbed into flour mixture with my fingers.  Put my unpeeled sliced peaches in a bowl and added a little more than 1 teaspoon almond extract and 1 tablespoon cornstarch.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  It smelled heavenly.  Served hot with vanilla ice cream.  Husband asked what made the topping taste \"like candy.\"  I'm glad I used the cornstarch; my peaches were pretty soft and VERY juicy.  My new favorite crisp recipe!  Thank you!",
