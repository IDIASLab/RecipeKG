I actually added more cherries than the recipe called for and I folded them in (as suggested in another review). A few pieces did end up with more cherries than others because I folded rather than placed them but this was not a problem for those who got those pieces. My husband suggested that I add even more cherries. This was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing Traci!",

I iced it with whipped cream sweetened with powdered sugar and flavored with vanilla and some chopped cherries. I later compared the recipe to the one in my Betty Crocker book and noted that there are less eggs in this recipe among other things which might explain why it wasn't real tall and fluffy. I will try it again for another occasion.",
