An hour before serving I added the beans let the cooker heat back to simmer then the last 30 minutes I added the pasta. Much more flavorful.",

Changed the method a little too: Cooked the chickpeas saut\u00e9ed oinion and garlic in another saucepan added tomatoes to the onion added water spices and cooked chickpeas cooked the pasta and added that.

I doubled the amount of garbanzos added a little more pasta (which I had ready because of other reviews) added 3 tablespoons of tomato paste and at the last minute added a can of Italian Green Beans. This brought the flavor of this soup up quite nicely and was a hearty and satisfying meal. With these additions my yield was 8 servings. Very good basic recipe.",
