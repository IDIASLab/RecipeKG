Additional mods: 1) Added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to fruit mixture; 2) increased topping by one half; 3) to topping added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. cardamom; 4) substituted buttermilk for milk. As mentioned by others the fruit mixture does end with more liquid than typical however with the increase in topping it evens out. Delicious and will make again:)",
