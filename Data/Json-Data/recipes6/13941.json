Today, as I eat yesterday's wilted leftovers from a Tupperware container at 9am in the morning, I thought I'd write a review! I make this salad all the time now. I use spinach and other greens. I use toasted (10 minutes in 350 oven - no butter) pine nuts now insead of the almonds and will never go back - they are perfect for this salad. I add one container of blue cheese (a must for us - perfect blend of flavors). I use one 6 oz package Craisins. I've never used the poppy seeds - but the toasted sesame seeds (also at 350 for 10 minutes) are a must. I may or may not use dried minced onion.  Toss all dressing ingredients in a container with a lid - and shake! This salad has been a hit with everyone I've served it to - dinner party, Easter lunch, dinner at home. It is so easy and easy to transport, too - just add the dressing once you get to where you're going. Try it - I bet you'll love it!! \r\n\r\n",

Since the sugar content isn't part of the nutritional info, you might find it enlightening to know that it contains a whopping 174 g (that's a full cup's worth) of sugar, or 2T per serving, assuming you used sweetened dried cranberries. If you managed to find unsweetened cranberries, you can reduce that figure to a \"mere\" 96 grams. Having as much or more sugar than your average cupcake qualifies it as more of a dessert. Because salads are typically thought of as healthy, you should know what your'e getting into with this one! Rating is for recipe as published, not with adjustments.",

I also substituted walnuts for the almonds and added a good bit of feta cheese.  (I never can stick to a recipe-- I can't help but personalize!)  Overall, this is a GOOD salad!",
