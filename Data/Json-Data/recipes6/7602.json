Second time I swapped the seeds for some chopped pecans and a little coconut. Much better. Both times kind of dry. I would say watch them carefully as they bake. They may not look done check carefully. I found about 9 1/2 minutes is about right for my oven. Also I used a small scoop got 13 cookies. I have a similar recipe for oatmeal cupcakes am thinking I might swap the coconut for a little oatmeal and see how it is. If you are on a special diet these are definitely worth trying. Ok so yesterday when I made these I kind of doubled the recipe. Used three small bananas (because they needed to be used up) no seeds about two cups of old fashioned oats 3/4 cup of pecans added a tablespoon of vanilla two scoops of vanilla protein and two of chocolate (because I only had two of the vanilla left) and then the chocolate chips. With these changes I could raise this to four stars for a special recipe cookie. If you want a real decadent cookie heck out Bobbie s Oatmeal cookies on this site. Unfortunately due to diabetes Bobbie s is now only for my husband",
