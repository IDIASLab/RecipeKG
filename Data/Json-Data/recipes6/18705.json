I did change the recipe a little used butter instead of margarine omitted the walnuts for personal preferance and baked in a bundt pan because I don't have a 10x15 pan. Stayed with the 2 cups of sugar even though I thought it was too much but ended up not too sweet like I thought it would. It was a very moist cake but the next time I make it will try grating the apples instead of chopping and using applesauce to replace some of the butter and spicing it up a bit more with cloves and nutmeg. Definatly a cake worth making again.",

I first soaked the raisins in Appleton rum then I added an instant butterscotch pudding packet because my husband loves butterscotch (I think this is where I messed up the cooking time). The batter was way too thick plus I think I chopped my apples a little too coarsely. In any case I m soaking more raisins right now and I m going to make this again tomorrow without the pudding.",
