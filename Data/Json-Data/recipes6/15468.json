I'm not sure if it was the recipe or if it's just me but in order for this to actually become ice cream I had to make sure the mixture was almost frozen before I even put it in the ice cream maker (which had been sitting in my freezer for at least 24 hours before I used it). After churning for about 20 minutes it started to look like ice cream. Then about 5 minutes later it was back to looking like melty soft serve. So after lots of re-freezing and re-churning I finally had my ice cream. It was okay kind of rich but I will try and add more vanilla next time since the freezing process really takes that away... Also this recipe freezes well. It doesn't turn into a brick either. It just likes to stay kind of soft.",
