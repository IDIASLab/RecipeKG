Even though using so many jalapenos sounds a little frightening to some, the meat is not really spicy, just good. It doesn't get much less complicated than this dish. Anyone can have success making it. Also, feel free to substitute pork ribs in place of a roast.",

I liked the addition of jalapenos in this recipe and also that it used brown sugar instead of white. This recipe also calls for a cup of soy sauce which I felt was spot on. The one thing I liked better about the other recipe is that it called for sesame oil. I will most definitely make this recipe again and will just add a tablespoon of sesame oil. Great recipe!",
