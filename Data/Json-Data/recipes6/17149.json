I am giving it a five because I have tried over six different recipes in attempt to find one that would produce a puffy cookie similiar to the big thick sugar cookies commonly sold at grocercy store bakeries. While this cookie is a little lighter than the bakery cookie it is very close. Also the dough rolled out fine (it sat 2 hours in the freezer and I used plenty of flour to roll it out). After cutting out my cookies I placed them in the freezer for an additional 7 minutes. They held their shape beautifully and had optimal height. Note: I did decrease the sour cream from 2 cups to 1 2/3 cups.",

I also used only 1 2/3 c sour cream. I made them a little thick so that the kids could decorate them a little easier and had to bake them a minute or two longer.
