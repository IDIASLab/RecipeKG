It travels AND refrigerates well and it can be eaten hot or cold.  What else is there to say?  I like to double the batch and bring it to work all week for lunch.  Sometimes I add chopped red bell pepper to the onion and garlic saute, but that's mostly for added color and nutrition.  It's also excellent just the way it is!  Two thumbs up!",

I used one can of black beans and chicken stock because I didn't have veggie stock on hand. Next time I'll add a drained can of tomatoes with green chiles. I let my quinoa soak while I did my prep work, a total of about 10 minutes, and the quinoa came out soft and mushy (like a wet couscous). I think you can skip the soaking part for a firmer, \"al dente\" quinoa and that should taste fine. I think soaking for an hour would have turned it completely into mush. ",

We added grated cheddar and sour cream at the table.\nThe seasonings were very nice, although next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will likely add a tiny bit more cayenne pepper.\nMy husband really raved over this one, although he tends to be wary of new \"health\" foods. He was also please with how economical this recipe can be.\nThis is a winner!",

Make sure you rinse your quinoa if it needs it! Otherwise this might come out very bitter. Also, hold back your garlic until your onions are at least halfway done or it will burn, and throw in the quinoa shortly after. Toasting it lends amazing flavor. Then, add the spices and saute for a moment more, mixing thoroughly, before adding the broth of your choice. Otherwise a great recipe. Thank you!",

When onions/beans/corn were heated through, I VERY gently tossed in the cooked quinoa & cilantro, being careful not to stir too much.  Turned out great!   I hope this is helpful for other readers.",
