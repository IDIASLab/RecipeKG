Better yet, if you have left-over sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving, freeze them, and make this cake for Christmas. The whipped sweet potatoes I use already have some butter and sugar, so I only use 1 3/4 cups of sugar in the batter, but adjust the sugar amount to your liking.",

I had some leftover carrots that I needed to use up and so I cooked and mashed them and used them in place of the sweet potatoes and it came out so delicious. My kids are already asking for another piece. I did made a few changes- I used only 1 cup white sugar and I had added a 1/2 cup brown sugar to the carrots which made the cake the perfect amount of sweet. I was out of eggs so I substituted mayo (which i have done several times with cakes and it works great) about 4TBSP I just eyeball it. The beer is completely unnecessary so I omitted it and nothing tasted like it was missing. If your batter needs thinning milk works great in place of the beer but I only used a little- not a complete half cup. My carrots had extra moisture and my batter was perfect. No icing necessary but u could use it if you wanted extra sweetness. A great versatile recipe thanks!",
