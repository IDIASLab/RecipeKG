However I found the cream cheese layer heavy in texture and flavor - it needs something to break up the taste of the cheese and lighten up the texture.

I also tried out the French Pastry crust recipe from this site (another great reviewer suggestion) which was wonderful but I actually think this recipe is more suited to a vanilla cookie or graham crumb crust.",
