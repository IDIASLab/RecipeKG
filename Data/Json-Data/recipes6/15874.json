I also halved the sugar, but it was still too sweet.  The dates & bananas give it ample sweetness.  Enjoy!",

I milled the full amount of flax (if left whole your body doesn't absorb any of its health benefits), replaced the oil with half a cup of unsweetened apple sauce, used a full cup (if not a little more) of the dates, threw in a handful of dried cranberries that needed to be used, added an extra banana and to spice it up used a generously heaped teaspoon of ground cinnamon. I topped the loaf with a sprinkling of rolled oats. I baked it for the complete amount of time given in the recipe as 55 minutes wasn't enough in my oven; but I recommend starting off with the minimum amount of time, and checking to see if it's done and baking longer if necessary.
