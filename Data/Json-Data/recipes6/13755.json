I cut the sugar in half as several other reviewers suggested and it was still sweet. I might try making it with Splenda to cut the calories.",

The recipe I have from my mom differs just slight--I use pineapple tidbits instead of chunks, 5 tbsp flour, 1.5 cups cheese, and just 1 stick of butter.  These instructions also don't specify what the butter is used for--I pour it over the Ritz crackers.  My mom mixes the crackers with the butter and then spreads that over the top.  Either way works, but I find it difficult to spread the butter-cracker mixture as it's kind of clumpy.  I also don't divide the cooking time--it all gets put together and cooked at the same time, included the cracker topping.",
