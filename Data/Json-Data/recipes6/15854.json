I changed the recipe a little using crushed pineapple instead of the chunks and I substituted Splenda and sugar free Cool-Whip which worked great. Also added sliced strawberries and kiwi as I wanted a fruitier salad. I ll be making this again as all my family really enjoyed it. Try adding extra salt a little at a time if it tastes flat after combining all the ingredients.",
