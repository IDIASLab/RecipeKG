I agree with the other reader it does not tell you when to put the vanilla in so I just added it to the milk flour sugar mixture as it was cooking along with cinnamon cloves and nutmeg. After cooking milk mixture I took it off the heat to cool doesn't say how long to let it cool before you add the beaten whites I added them when it was still hot and they don't FOLD in at all I ended up beating them in with whisk. Has great flavor and I will probably make again.",
