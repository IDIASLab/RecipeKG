I ended up dumping it all down the drain.   I use Marie's strawberry glaze and use my own real whipped cream as it tastes so much better than Cool Whip. Using small-medium sized berries makes for a better presentation -- turning them pointed side up.  This recipe is simple and delicious!   It reminds me of the pie served at Bob's Big Boy. Thanks Michelle!",

I also used fresh berries. This is an easy refreshing summer treat when strawberries are plentiful. I have never tried it with the frozen berries but this is a 5 with fresh berries!!!",
