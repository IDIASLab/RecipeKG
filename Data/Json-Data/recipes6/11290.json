I made these for my husband's birthday, and they were to DIE for! Usually, if there is more than one bad review, I'll expect the worst when I try a recipe, but these turned out perfectly. I like a thick \"crust\" though, and the first batch i tried didn't allow that. I just scooped the graham crackers directly on the bottom, and only what was sticking to the cheesecake stayed. The rest sat in the muffin liners. Since that didn't work at first, I just made a whole graham cracker crust recipe, and scooped large portions into the muffin liners. It was perfect. ",

Instead of using the cookie on the bottom, I crush the cookies in a food processor and scoop a spoonful into each muffin well.

But I got tired of making the big cheesecakes which we end up OVER eating and hast too many eggs and take up a whole lot of cream cheese! This recipe is good! You only need very few Ingredients! and it is a nice size for those who are on a diet! Plus they are cute. I did make some changes to the recipe! I used a graham cracker crust. I will explain how I prepared mine: I made the crust with 1 cup and a half of crackers 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I added about a tablespoon into each baking cup and patted it down. I baked the crust for about 8-10 min. just so they would be nice and cooked. (you might have a bit left.. just save it for later. I added an extra half a teaspoon of vanilla. I baked my mini cheesecakes for 25 minutes then I turned the oven off and left them in for about 10 minutes. I took the cups out of the mold and let them sit on a rack for about 20 minutes. I am always in a hurry to eat them so i put them in the freezer for about 20 min. then i added the cherries and put them back in the freezer for another 20.. They get nice and cold!... I don't know how good it is to cool them that fast.. but mine taste good! LOVE THIS RECIPE! give it a try.",
