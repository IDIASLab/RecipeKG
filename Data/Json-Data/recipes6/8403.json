But even though I stored them in an air tight container they got very dry and flavorless. I did make some modification based on what I have in my kitchen and I don't know if that contributed but I don't think so. I used almond butter instead of peanut regular flour in place of almond and honey instead of agave nectar. I left out the Stevia powder and maple extract and reduced the vanilla to 1 Tbsp. I do like that they are low in fat only have 10g of sugar and 6g of protein (made the way I made them). so that's good.",

I also added 1/2 tsp salt bc I\u2019ve never seen any baked good made without it. Otherwise I made them exactly as instructed and think they\u2019re great! I used another site to build the recipe exactly as I made it and my calorie count per muffin was quite a bit higher at 144 calories so I think that can vary quite a bit depending on your bananas and brands. But mine also had more protein at nearly 5g. Will definitely make these again!",

I used coconut sugar instead of agave since that s what I had. Also added some chia seeds. This is a great way to get flax and use my almond flour. The peanut butter didn t take over all the other great flavors and I even threw in some unsweetened coconut flakes and still plenty moist. Next time I want to add nuts and maybe some Craisons and choc chips. The possibilities are endless! Goes well with morning smoothie. Thanks!",
