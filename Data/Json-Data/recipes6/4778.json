Even though I cut my veggies up (except the onion that I started with) in between stirring that is still a long time! But I was determined to make healthier brown rice risotto. I also had to use over 12 cups of liquid instead of the 10 the recipe called for. I changed 1 cup of that to white wine to add more flavor. And 7 cups was broth and the remaining water. The result was a delicious veggie risotto that I might make again if I pull up a chair and call my favorite chatty friend.. haha...",

The smell is FANTASTIC the first few bites were delicious but the more I ate it the more I got tired of the taste. I paired it with ritz crackers and a tarty drink & it balanced the flavor out. It is more suited as a side. Also this is waaay more than six servings. I think I served myself two and it was less that 1/6 of the entire recipe.",

First I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because that's what I had on-hand. Second I only used the onion from this recipe and added mushrooms a few minutes after saut\u00e9ing the onion and garlic (used mushrooms because I was pairing this with chicken marsala). The mushroom flavor really stood out at the end - it was delicious! Will definitely be making this again maybe next time with more veggies!",
