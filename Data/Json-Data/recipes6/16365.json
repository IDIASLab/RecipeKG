I'm makeing another batch for tonights BBQ and shaping them into hot dog and hamburger rolls. I just added more oil water and flour to the recipe but not more yeast. We'll see how they come out.",

I didn't use my breadmaker as it's broken, so I kneaded it in my Kitchenaid Mixer w/the kneading attachment.  First for 8 minutes, let rise for 50mins, then knead again for 8 minutes and let rise for 30mins, then cut and shape into 3 pieces and let rise again with a wet towel for 20mins.  Stuck it into a preheated 375 oven for 20 minutes.  Voila!!  Perfect small baguettes for lunch.  ",

We live at 4600 ft. so I add an additional 2 tbsp. of water and used slightly less than 1 tsp. yeast to keep the loaf from falling. The result was a very light and airy bread.

I have stopped buying grocery store bread because of all the additives this recipe is so simple I know it by heart already. It's easy to throw the ingredients in the bread machine and go about my day without much time or effort. The size is perfect for getting sandwich-size slices for my kids and they love it toasted with butter too! The small loaf also requires I make a fresh loaf almost daily which my family appreciates. This will be my go-to daily bread recipe from now on.",

I didn't have powdered egg substitute so I went with one egg white (per SD) and I used 2 cups of soft-milled whole wheat bread flour instead of mixing the white/WW. I also added 1 Tbsp flax meal and 1 Tbsp of WW Gluten..made for a a very softy fluffy bread. I made it in the breadmaker on the dough setting as I like to bake my breads in the oven. Once done in the bread machine I rolled it out on the counter with a rolling pin and then rolled it up jelly roll style (like a French Loaf) and then let it rise for about an hour and then baked it...YUM! Pics coming to computer screen near you soon!:) Great recipe with Scotdog's tips next time I may add some chopped sunflower seeds or walnuts....hmmmm...so many choices!",
