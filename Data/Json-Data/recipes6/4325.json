Perhaps it was because it called for a whole tablespoon of curry powder? Also as is the recipe calls for no salt or pepper so I added about 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/8 tsp. of ground black pepper for more flavor. The one good thing about this recipe is how quick and easy it is to make. Even so I wouldn't make it again. Thanks for sharing though!",
