When I make this again & there will be a next time - I will add a layer of sweet potatoes & maybe stir some of the cranberry or dried cranberries into the cheesecake layer. You could do a layer of vegetables too. Thanks for an inspiring recipe Sarah.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is a real conversation starter!  And it tastes great too!!  In our house there is no such thing as leftover stuffing or cranberry sauce, so here are my CHANGES: I made a large box of stuffing as per the instructions on the box but I had to add 3 tablespoons of gravy to the stuffing to get it extra moist, so it would press into the pan well.  I used an immersion blender for the cheese mixture which worked well and made the cake light and fluffy.  THE COOKING TIME WAS OFF ON THIS: after 35 minutes the centre was still runny, so I left it in for another 7 minutes.  I finished it by spreading the canned sauce on top and baking it for another 10 minutes.  For a total of 52 minutes cooking time.   LET IT STAND FOR 5-10 MINUTES before slicing, this helped it slice beautifully.   TO SERVE: No side dishes necessary for this meal, it was great on its own.  This would be a great \"make ahead dish\" as it tasted even better the next day and was easy to reheat in the oven and microwave.  Anyhow great job Sarah!  This will be my new party dish for potlucks and showers.",
