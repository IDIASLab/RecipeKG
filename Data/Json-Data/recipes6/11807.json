Another reviewer commented about \"greasiness\" and since I'm familiar with cookies like this with that characteristic I preemptively cut the oil back from one cup to 2/3 cup. That obviously did the trick because greasiness was not an issue. Just for something different I used rainbow chips (readily available online) rather than chocolate chips.",
