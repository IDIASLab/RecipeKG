                "reviewBody": "I doubled this recipe because I wanted to have it for the entire week. Here are the changes I made:\nAny recipe with soy sauce you must taste before you incorporate the rest of your ingredients. Having cooked w/ soy sauce before I knew 2/3c would be too much for me but maybe it works for others. Even in doubling the recipe, I only used \"1/4\" c of low sodium soy sauce. (Keep in mind, if you use terriyaki sauce, it has soy sauce in it so don't use both!).  Sesame seed oil is what gives most oriental dishes it's flavor but used sparingly.  A little goes a long way and it has a strong flavor. Brown your chicken first in the oil and then marinate it.  You will still get all the flavor when you pour the marinade you made in the pot w/ the veggies & chicken. For my marinade, I used 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c soy sauce, 1/2c sweet & sour sauce, 1/4 rice wine vinegar, tbsp ginger, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4c green onions, 3 tbsp red pepper flakes. Take browned chicken & put in a ziplock & pour the marinade over it. Place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. I used thawed frozen veggies & only saut\u00e9ed them in the sesame oil 3-5 min so they wouldn't get soggy during the cooking time w/ the chicken. I also used brown rice and all came out great!",

For those of you complaining about the level of saltiness - marinate the chicken in a portion of the liquid, just enough to cover it.  Reserve the remainder of the sauce and add at the end, a little bit by little bit, tasting as you go.  I don't understand why people blame the recipe for being overpoweringly salty, at the end of the day, you're the one cooking!  Any good chef knows they must taste as they go.
