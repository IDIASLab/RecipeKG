If the ingredients in this recipe appeal to you to begin with you've GOT to make this bread. So as the 1st reviewer some helpful tips. I couldn't see boiling the garlic for 15 minutes. It wastes 15 minutes and it wastes a lot of garlic flavor into the water. So I mashed it with the salt called for with the back of my chef's knife into a paste. The pine nuts can be quickly toasted in the microwave - it just takes a minute or two. But here's my main criticism: the recipe directs you to include the oil you've drained off the tomatoes. Now how much is that? Waaay too vague and the amount of oil used could make or break this bread! So rather than trying to guess at how much that should be and rather than the 2 T. shortening I simply did away with both and used a quarter cup of olive oil and called it a day. It was perfect. I didn't have provolone so I used another semi-firm cheese ricotta salata and a couple of tablespoons of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. A \"bunch\" of green onions is also vague so I chopped up just the green part and added it to my liking. I threw in some black olives because I had some already opened and because I knew they'd be a great addition. Finally I brushed the warm baked bread with melted butter. Golden crust hearty dense and robustly flavorful - this bread is a beauty.",

This bread did not disappoint tasty moist and delicious! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I did as the other reviewers using olive oil eyeballing the green onions and making a paste with the garlic and salt. I had high hopes for this bread but frankly I was a little disappointed. It didn't quite have the pizzaz I was expecting. I'm thinking I would have liked it better with roasted red pepper rather than the sun-dried tomatoes but then I guess it wouldn't be tomato bread!",

The loaf was colorful flavorful and I really wouldn't change a thing- it's quite perfect the way it is! Some observations: On the tomato instruction I would add: \"Diced reserving oil for later\"; and a descriptive word for the \"batter\". (Batter will be Thick Lumpy Like Dough etc...) As I wasn't sure if it was the right consistency- mine did come out thick/ lumpy but turned out PERFECT when baked in the stoneware breadpan! I also served it with seasoned Olive Oil for dipping- and it disappeared quickly!:)",

I followed the advice of the reviewer Naples for the most part plus I left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any and subbed about a Tblsp. of minced onion for the green onion. I had a feeling with the ingredients that it would be similar to a beer type bread but decided to give it a try anyway. It was sweet tasting dry and spices and flavorings just didn't go in my opinion. It really sounded interesting but after a couple of slices it sat and got tossed and I really dislike any food waste. There was nothing I could really turn it into with all of the spices tomatoes and garlic.",
