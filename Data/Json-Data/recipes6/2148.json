I used olive oil splenda and raisins but otherwise made the recipe as noted putting the batter into a non-stick sprayed glass dish. It made dense oatmeal cookie flavoured bars with a chewy texture and they are pretty much perfect as is. High protein high fibre and satisfying. I may try using only 1/4 cup oil and some applesauce or a banana just to cut the fat a little more but I will definitely make these again! THANKS SO MUCH FOR POSTING!",
