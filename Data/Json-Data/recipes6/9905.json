Mix 2/3 cup room-temperature (unsalted) butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup packed brown (light or dark). I like the almond flavor, so add 1 1/2 tsp extract. Add the whole beaten egg, except for 1 tsp. Sift 1 1/2 cups of flower and 1/2 tsp of baking powder into butter/sugar/egg mixture. Put dough in greased 9\" pie plate. Mix reserved egg w/ 1 tsp water and brush over dough. I like to add some turbinado sugar on top for crunch rather than the slivered almonds, but that's a matter of taste. Bake for 25-30 mins. at 350F until firm to the touch. Comes out great!",

In Holland we don't use brown sugar for this recipe but a white sugar that is similar in texture to brown sugar. I have never made this using egg and omitted it this time too and it was still delicious. Good to know for those with egg allergies. Take this out of the oven when light brown leave it in too long and you could break a tooth once it's cool.",

As another user mentioned; in holland we don't use brown sugar but white sugar that has the same consistency as brown sugar. it's called basterd sugar. (doesn't translate well ;-) Therefore results into boterkoek that's way darker than a typical Dutch one.\nI used an 8x12 pyrex dish and baked for about 30 minutes. When the edges start to turn brown it's time to take it out even when the middle still looks very pale. it's easy to overbake these and then they'll be rock hard :-/ Also, I used parchement paper to make it easy to get the boterkoek out of the pyrex (and less mess). Let cool down before attempting to start cutting these up or they will fall apart.",

Hubby said the only thing he would like different is to drizzle warm honey on the top so next time I make them I might do that for him.  Excellent job, thanks for sharing!\n\nEdited on July 1st...My son, who is on a European adventure with People to People, called me last night from Switzerland!  They will be home on Wednesday.  All of his friends that ate these cookies at the above mentioned project fair were asking him to call home and have me make some for them to have as soon as they got back.
