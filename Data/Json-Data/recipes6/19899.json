The only coffee-cake aspect of the recipe is the name.  To avoid cake collapse, the wet ingredients (excluding the sour cream) need to be whipped as long as possible, then the sour cream and dry ingredients should be folded in gently by hand.  The dry ingredients should be mixed together before adding to the wet.  These types of techniques will leaven the cake a little.  To make it more a buckle and less a pound cake, use only 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup sugar and more fruit.  Otherwise, you're eating a blueberry, sugar crumbed pound cake.  Also - if you increase the fruit, and decrease the sugar/butter, expect to bake it longer to absorb the extra moisture.  I baked mine for 1 hr 30 min in a 350 oven and it was still very moist.",

Beautiful recipe and everyone at the office is raving about it.  Words used to describe this cake included, \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cdivine\u201d.  Many thanks to dmcarm.\n\nAddendum:  I made this for Thanksgiving and froze it. As wonderful as this cake is, it didn't freeze well.  The texture after thawing was too moist and it just wasn't as good as fresh.  It was torture having it in the freezer anyway.",

First cake came out almost prefect but still 5 stars - baked for 60 minutes in my convection oven using frozen berries. It was luscious BUT very sweet and some of the blueberries sank to the bottom of the pan which caused part of it to stick to the Bundt pan and therefore not unmold perfectly. Armed with suggestions from the reviews and some newly-acquired tricks from the interwebs, I was ready to try again.\n\nSecond time, I reduced butter to 3/4 cups (1 1/2 sticks) and sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested here. I substituted 1/2 teaspoon almond extract for the vanilla and that coordinated nicely with the pecan and brown sugar flavors. Now here comes the technique. To keep the berries from sinking to the bottom of the pan - this time I shook my frozen blueberries in a Ziploc bag of flour and shook off the excess flour in a strainer before putting them into the cake. Also, I wanted to try creating a \"stripe\" of blueberry goodness in the middle of the cake rather than blueberries throughout, which would also help the sticking problems. So instead of mixing the floured berries into the batter, I sprinkled them ON TOP of the cinnamon-brown sugar-pecan mixture that went in the middle of the cake.\n\nResults: Perfection at 60 minutes in the oven and unmolded beautifully!",
