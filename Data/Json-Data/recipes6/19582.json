The only modification I made the first time round was to reduce the sugar from 3/4 to 2/3 cup.  It was still plenty sweet especially with canned fruit cocktail in syrup, so I may reduce the sugar a bit more the next time round.  Classic almond jello is made with agar agar, and I have yet to find a good recipe for this.  Gelatin has a slightly different texture, more spring and elasticity, but is a good substitute.  My toddler loves it, and it's a good way to get calcium in him!  The next times I try it, I will experiment with unsweetened soy instead of milk, using 3 cups milk to 1 cup water, substituting coconut milk for 1 cup of milk, etc.  This is a keeper!",
