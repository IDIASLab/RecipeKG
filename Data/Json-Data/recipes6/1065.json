The buttery brown sugary and vanilla mixture is very rich and really makes this recipe rock out. If you are looking for a s'more I would recommend using milk chocolate chips like I did instead of semi-sweet. I broiled mine in the oven for 3 minutes and then placed in the freezer to cool them. Excellent recipe!",
