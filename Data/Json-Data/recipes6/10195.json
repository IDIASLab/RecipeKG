I also thought the dough was a bit more like a batter so I just added more flour so it was a bit more manageable to shape into balls. As the other reviews had said it wasn't sweet enough I added a little sugar to the butter whilst creaming about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tad more maple syrup than the recipe called for. I also sprinkled some demerara sugar over them before they went in the oven. I knew they would be good as the smell from the oven was fantastic. Will definitely make these again! Thanks:)",

I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar because the previous reviews said they added sugar, I suggest to add sugar it makes it sweet but not too overbearing. I also used fresh maple syrup from an organic market, not the bottled kind, if you can get your hands on some fresh maple syrup it makes the cookies that much better!! I also used just a little less butter, everyone loves them!",
