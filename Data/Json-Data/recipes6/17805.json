It was sweet slightly cinnamon-y but there was no discernable yogurt/fruit flavor that I could tell. I did change some things... I didn't have the yogurt spread that it called for so I used 1/2 c. cherry low-fat yogurt and 1/4 c berry jam. I used 1 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c white (although I thought it too sweet - next time I may cut out half the sugar and let the fruit do the sweetening). Instead of 1/2 c olive oil I used 1/4 c canola oil and 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce. I upped the cinnamon to 1 heaping tsp and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Mixing the yogurt and jam with the butter and sugar all at once didn't work too well... you should cream the butter and sugar first then add in the yogurt and jam when you add in the other wet ingredients. I baked for the full 15 min. but then my oven runs a little cool. Cookies spread quite a bit but the texture was Great; nice and chewy in the center yet crispy around the edges. This recipe is definately worth tinkering with to resolve what seems to be missing! That's why I rated it 5 stars even though I was a little disappointed with the bland-ish results...",

                "reviewBody": "These cookies are very good. The strawberry flavor came through deliciously. Be sure you use strawberry yogurt SPREAD as stated in the recipe - Brummel and Brown has a good one. I'm not sure I like the olive oil in these. I am going to try making them again with vegetable oil or maybe coconut oil to see the difference but I do recommend giving these a try. They weren't too sweet either. I think if you are finding them too sweet it might be a result of using something other than the yogurt spread. I think using the spread is key to getting these cookies just right. I love how they have a little crunch but at the same time they are soft and chewy. I HIGHLY recommend adding white chocolate chips to these. It really brings out the flavors and be sure to add at least a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.",
