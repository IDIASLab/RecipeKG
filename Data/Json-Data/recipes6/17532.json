Eventhough I packed the coconut when I measured it I had to add extra to make the egg whites less runny. I used a small cookie scoop to get a nice mound of coconut. They kind of fell apart on the sheet but I just reshaped them and they held their shape when baked. After all that I was very pleased with the end result. They turned a nice golden brown and didn't ooze the egg whites out the bottom. I couldn't stop eating them either. They are so addicting. The almond paste is secret ingredient in these. It's a good idea to put the mini chips in the macaroon rather than dipping them in chocolate easier too. Good recipe to try if you like coconut and chocolate. I will make again just will have to find a short-cut with the almond paste and sugar maybe have my husband do it.:)",
