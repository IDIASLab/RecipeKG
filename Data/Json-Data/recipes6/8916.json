I ate them on their own but did fry up and egg to serve over my hubs and he said it was an excellent combo. We both really enjoyed this recipe. The one thing I will say is that there is no need to fill the pot with so much water just to wait for it to come to a boil and then turn around and drain all of that flavor off. Simple throw everything in the pan and then barely cover the potatoes in water. Everything gets distributed evenly and it comes out great.",
