For the marinade, I cut down on oil quite a bit, used  lemon juice instead of vinegar and added crushed pepper in addition to chili powder. It worked great! I used all the recommended fresh veggies but no canned corn or beans. Finally I marinated veggies for 10 min at room temperature and then stir fried it on high heat on a very hot skillet. The results were mouthwatering and my husband loved it! Thanks so much for such a great recipe.",
