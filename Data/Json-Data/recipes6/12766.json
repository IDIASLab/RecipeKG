Since the marshmallow melts as it bakes it is important to make sure the edges are really sealed well--if not the center will ooze out and you'll lose much of that sweet goodness. This is a great recipe to make with kids--it's easy they love the finished product and they are really pleased with themselves!",

Just dip the marshmallow in the butter and then in the sugar/cinnamon and roll them up to bake (We bake them in Muffin tins). These have to be made just before serving for the best taste but I love them cold as well. The marshmallow melts and leaves the inside with an ooey gooey sweet glaze. They are SOOOOOOO good and not a holiday goes by without them. We have twin 2 year olds who now help Mom make them and eat them and my Hubby as well as my sisters Hubby had never heard of such a roll but now they are as addicted as we all are.",

This was so much more amazing than expected. I halved the recipe because I just wanted to test it. I also didn't do a very good job of following the directions either and it was still AMAZING! I just made them two days ago and my husband already wants them again. They might be a new favorite holiday treat. The only things I changed that I would suggest is adding the remainder of the cinnamon mixture into the glaze for some added kick. I guess I also dipped the buttered top into the cinnamon mixture before baking too. Extremely pleased!",
