I chose to drain them, and I wish that I\u2019d at least added some of the bean liquid back to the mixture before going into the oven.  We like our baked beans cold better than hot.  I typically remove them from the oven before the recommended cooking time, so there\u2019s a little more liquid as I think that consistency is better when cold.  I made half a recipe, set the timer for 80 minutes (10 minutes less than the recipe indicated), and the beans were slightly overcooked.  I think 90 minutes would have been a disaster.  I added some water to the dish, mixed it in well, so all was good.  I mention this only because 90 minutes sounded like a lot of time to me for baking beans, so you may want to be cautious, and start checking them at 60 minutes for doneness (I know I will the next time).  These are fairly sweet baked beans, but they\u2019re good.  My apples probably were closer to being minced than chopped, so the next time I will cut them a little larger, so I know when I\u2019m biting into apple.",

I left out the raisins  but added about a 1/2 cup onions I cooked in the bacon grease and also added about 1/2 teaspoon of browning sauce. I do recommend reducing the brown sugar a bit unless you like your beans sweet. If you want to make those apples stand out more cut them larger.",
