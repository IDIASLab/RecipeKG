Standard cake mixes come in 16.5 oz boxes - since recipe calls for 9 oz  mix, and my box of mix was 16.5 oz, I made two cakes. One can of sliced pineapple has 10 slices, so worked just fine. Use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp butter or margarine per 9 inch pan. I melted the butter in each pan, mixed in the brown sugar. Bake time was only an extra 3 minutes so that is probably due to oven variance. I did use the juice from the pineapple instead of water in the mix as it only made sense to do so. Came out perfect!",

First, use fresh pineapple don't use canned pineapple, the difference is huge,the canned tastes \" tin-ey\". Next replace the water in the cake recipe with real pineapple juice. Replace the vegetable oil for coconut oil(liquefied). Also add your own high quality real vanilla extract to the batter. this will take your cake from good to great. I don't use marshino cherries,ick. You could use real cherries or just leave them out, it is still a pretty cake. A silicone bake pan makes it super easy. make sure you put it on a cookie sheet in the oven. Also it always takes me longer to bake then the stated time. Good Luck!",
