After canning it and cooling it it's returned to the crumbly sugary state it was before adding the water. Clearly there has got to be some liquid missing in this recipe? I found another one on another site I will try...its basically the same recipe with the addition of 1/2 C apple juice.) For what it's worth it tasted fantastic before it cooled and hardened.",
