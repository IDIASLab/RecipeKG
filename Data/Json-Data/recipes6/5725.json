I made this the night before my dinner party and refridgerated it, which really help to \"set\" it and bring out the flavors.  Because it was initially chilled it was easy to remove from the meatloaf pan and it sliced very well without crumbling. I sliced it all up before reheating and serving. I served this with a traditional brown gravy. All my guests talked about it for weeks afterwards.",

I didn't have 3 cans of black so I threw in a can of garbanzo...which didn't like to be mashed...things got messy...but anyway-- I used 2 cans black one garbanzo 7oz can green chiles one egg sleeve crackers onion a little taco and ranch dip frozen sweet corn cheese. Put in a dish like brownies didn't form a loaf. My family LOVED LOVED LOVED it. Served with brown rice and garlic and butter sauted green beans and spinach. Big hit:) Next time I will make it with maybe a can of Northern beans the garbanzo beans were a tad dry and will try to make it vegan.",

I did put in BBQ sauce because I thought it might be dry.  I didn't have Ranch seasoning mix so I made my own with 3tbsp parsley, 1 tbsp dill weed, 1 tbsp granulated garlic, 1 tbsp granulated onion, 2 tsp salt and 1tsp pepper.   I used the whole eggs (opps).  I served it with guacamole on the top.\n\nWe ate it with Mexican Rice, Garden Salad and Pineapple.\n\nThings I would do differently.  I would not add in the jalopenos directly into the mixture but let people add there own heat on top afterwards.\n\nGreat Recipe.  Thanks for sharing it will be on our supper rotation list.",
