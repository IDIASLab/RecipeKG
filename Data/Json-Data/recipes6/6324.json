So this was a first, this is a perfect base recipe but we like a little more flavor.\nMY TIP: Add a meat, like bacon or kielbaska- brown the meat first, set meat aside, then add the butter, onions...and so forth, into the meat drippings. Follow the recipe from there. Lastly chop up the meat into tiny pieces and add to the noodles. Also, a little sprinkling of garlic powder adds another flavor layer. Consider adding a box of frozen pierogi's at the very end and cook app 10 minutes longer till hot in the center. Still very simple and very good.",

Then after mixing noodles & cabbage together, sprinkle with garlic powder and onion powder, along with salt & pepper. Half my family also loves it with crumbled bacon too!!!",

I fry it up crisp and crumble it in just as I'm about to eat so the bacon stays crunchy. Third: BACON FAT! I fry the bacon first and then use the bacon fat plus butter added as needed to do the onions and cabbage. I'm telling you - the bacon and fat kicks it out of this world. Note - I only make it once a month, or even less, cause I'm not trying to die over here.",
