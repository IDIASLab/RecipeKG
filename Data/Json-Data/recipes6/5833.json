It cooked thoroughly in 6 hours but wasn't as soupy as an original Booyah. Regardless it was delicious. The flavour is country-style and rustic. The seasonings just accent the dish and allow the flavour of the vegetables beef and chicken to come through. No oil no gluten no dairy adjust the salt as you wish this is definitely a dish to take for a pot-luck or large gathering and everyone will be pleased. Thank you wbartelme for sharing your recipe.",

I also added a large clove of finely minced garlic. This came out to be a very tasty and healthy dish and I'll definitely make it again especially during the winter months.",

I used about 1 T. Better Than Bouillon Vegetable concentrate instead of Swanson's (which is no longer available); and canned moose meat instead of beef stew meat. I also cut the salt to 1 T. but still thought that was too much. My husband thought this was the best stew he's ever had and I also liked it in spite of a little more salt than I would prefer so I'm sure I'll be making this often this winter. I like that it makes enough that there's plenty to freeze in gallon Ziploc bags to heat up when we're to busy to cook.",

Our first version of Booyah was prepared with what was on hand: all fresh veggies except corn & tomatoes; chicken breast meat and garlic sausage instead of beef; did not peel red potatoes; chicken broth only Italian seasoning replaced dried herbs green onions (tops and white); no celery or veggie base and broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. Salt & pepper were used to taste only. Try your own adjustments to taste and what's on hand. This is a no-fail recipe no matter what your ingredient choices.

There was a bit too much salt for me but it was easily remedied. Took 3 large peeled Idaho Potatoes and placed them whole in the Stew about half way through the cooking process they acted as Salt Sponges and removed the excess salt (threw them away when stew was ready). I suggest you go primal and cook outside so everyone can enjoy the wonderful aromatic smell coming off the stew.",

Don't make the full recipe unless you have a slow cooker the size of a hot tub!  I halved it and STILL couldn't fit in the potatoes.  I cubed and boiled them separately in another BIG pot then stirred everything together when the slow-cooking stuff was finished.  Since frozen veggies come in a mix of corn, carrots, and beans -- I just used bags of those.  I cut up the chicken and beef into small, bite-sized pieces.  I think when I make it again, I'll do what I've learned from reading these reviews -- brown the beef in a skillet first.  Maybe it's me but beef in a slow-cooker (unless a brown sauce is used) just doesn't LOOK as good.  Couldn't find packets of veggie base so bought the kind in a jar.  Just guessed at the equivalent -- it looked like Vegemite!  Can't wait to take this to work in  lunches!",

If you use the Better Than Bouillon you can add it very easily later on as you're cooking.",
