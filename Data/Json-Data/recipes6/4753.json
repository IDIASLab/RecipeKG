I also used some chantrelle mushrooms; I would never use canned mushrooms. Yuck. I did use sherry. Did not use potatoes because I wanted to freeze leftovers. I think because I used the Golden mushroom soup it did not come out looking like dog food. I put the peas in about an hr before finished so they still looked bright green. Cooked on high for 4 hrs.
