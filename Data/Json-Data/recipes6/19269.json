I wasn't sure about the dressing as I generally am not a fan of sweet dressings but the tart lime offset it nicely and the thing that made it for me was the toasted coconut. Only ingredient change was grapeseed oil instead of vegetable - otherwise I wouldn't change a thing! Really enjoyed this!",

But like I said this salad was amazing and I would recommend it to everyone I Know I think it will become my new side dish at family get togethers. Thank you.",

Now to my personal tastes it reminded me more in drink flavors of like a strawberry margarita vs. a strawberry daiquiri (I believe that was due to the lime juice). But who cares what the name is...this salad was excellent. And it was just as visually as it tasted! This by far is the best I have made from this site! I can't wait to make it again and again!
