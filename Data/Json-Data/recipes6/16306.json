I'm not sure if it was the elevation but I had to used two eggs beaten in order for the bread crumbs to be moist enough not to fade into sawdust in the oven. I also substituted a cheddar and monterey jack mixture for the mozzarella as I like a little bite. I also sprinkled paprika and fresh ground black pepper on top of the cheese mixture and grated fresh romano before applying the bread crumbs for a bit more spice.",

I don't know if they got that way from being baked in the oven or if they were too ripe not ripe enough etc. At least the rest of it tastes good!",
