Some things we did differently were add shrimp and use chicken broth instead of veggie broth just because thats all we had on hand. The step about the orzo confused me I take instructions very literally did it mean cooked orzo? At any rate we continued the recipe as instructed minus the orzo step and added the cooked orzo and shrimp at the end and stirred it up into one yummy \"stew\".;)",

I think the next time I will use diced tomatoes instead of the whole stewed ones and see if that makes a difference in the texture. The parmesan gave it an Italian flavor that I loved. Romano cheese would also work. I just can't get past browning that orzo. That makes it soooo perfect! Shredding the veggies is a must since it is in keeping with the texture you start with the orzo. EXCELLENT recipe!",

To begin with saute orzo with garlic and onions and then add all kinds of vegetables - I added zucchini carrots broccoli cauliflower and asparagus. Followed the steps after that however the vegetable broth to pasta ratio is really off. I added another 14 ounce can of vegetable broth the pasta. I added crushed red pepper flakes on the top (extra kick) and extra Parmesan cheese for the kids. Overall a decent recipe.",
