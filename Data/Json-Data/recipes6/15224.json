Good recipe; just needs less sugar. (UPDATE! GREAT IDEA!! We had quite a bit of leftover punch which I froze--hate to waste anything--and the kids took it out and scooped it for dessert. Wow!!! I am going to try this on purpose still with less sugar because it was almost syrupy. Like a granita. I will stir a bit while freezing and this time LEAVE more SPACE in freezer container for expansion!) Also for double punch recipe I used 1/4 less sherbet and it was fine.",

As written I give this 4 stars because the sugar is way too much. This time I made a double batch and only used 3 cups total. This was perfect for us. So give this one a try but add your sugar to taste not as the recipe states. Also when I made it this time I could not find any unsweetened drink mix that was just lime so I used lemon-lime and it was still great.",
