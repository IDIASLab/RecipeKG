I agree with a previous reviewer that you should either double the batter or cut down on the apples...I split the batter and started spreading half of it in the bottom of a 9 by 13 pan (as called for) but immediately saw it wasnt near enough batter. so i switched to a 7 by 11 pan, put half batter on bottom, covered with only 3/4 of the apple mixture and topped with half of the batter. So, either double batter of cut down on the apples. i dont understand the negative reviews...trust me, this cake DOESNT TASTE PASSOVER and got rave reviews by my family. if you try ANYTHING, TRY THIS--trust me!!!!!!!!!",

I had to press the \"bottom\" part of the batter into the pan it was so thick! And when I took it out of the oven it was very oily (what appeared like oil). I let it cool for a few hours and when the boyfriend tasted it he said it didn't taste like Pesach and he would've believed me if I had told him it wasn't! That's the highest compliment seeing as he dreads Passover food. Thank you!",

The \"cake\" portion was soggy, and I ended up throwing the whole thing out.  It was a complete waste time of ingredients and time.\r\n\r\nMarlene",
