For the second time I followed another reviewers suggestion and used a brownie bottom and used the Chocolate Ganache recipe posted by another on this site http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Ganache/Detail.aspx and it was divine. I made the ganache and poured it on the cake after it sat in the fridge for the two days and then popped the whole thing in the freezer again until the weekend (for another party). Thank you Kristen...everyone said this was as good as or better than any bakery cake they've had. I would give it 10 stars if I could for all the accolades I received on this. It is SO rich...I need to brush my teeth immediately after eating.",
