I ended up having to make another (double) batch of this recipe without any baking powder and then mixing it all together which turned out pretty well. The triple recipe gave me a total of 2 regular loaf pans 5 mini loaves an 8\"x10\" pan 24 regular muffins and 4 giant muffins. And all of them took WAAAAAY longer to cook than the recipe said. Even the regular muffins took almost half an hour. Having said that however the bread was quite tasty. I did make a few changes: I had no almond extract so I substituted almond meal for about 1/3 of the flour called for. I also switched coconut cream for the evaporated milk and I used coconut oil instead of 1/3 of the butter. I didn't have enough grated coconut for the whole triple recipe but with those additions it still tasted good and coconutty. (It probably would have tasted even better if I'd had enough instead of just about half.) I had a problem with the outside getting too dark while the inside was still gooey.",
