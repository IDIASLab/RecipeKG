I prefer to bake it in the oven rather than in the machine, because the top rises too much for my bread machine.  Most of the time I sub 1 c. whole wheat flour for the white.  I have made cinnamon raisin bread: add 1 tablespoon cinnamon, more sugar and some raisins.  I have made garlic bread: add a couple of minced garlic cloves and some italian seasoning.  This recipe makes great italian breadsticks, just roll it out, twist and bake.",
