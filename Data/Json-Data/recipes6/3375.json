Adobo is the name for the marinade. Use either all pork belly or a mix of it plus other pork cuts such as loin and shoulder. Key elements are the use of dark soy sauce, not light, sparkling lemonade, and apple (Pink Lady&reg;, Jazz&trade;, or Pacific Rose&trade; are ideal). Serve with rice.",

While making this recipe I adjusted ingredients as what seemed necessary to double the recipe however it wasn't a simple x 2. The only pork belly available was uncured \"sliced\" bacon in 1 lb. packages; I used 1...next time ask the meat dept. manager to order some pork belly or use 2 pounds of bacon (if absolutely necessary...) it's a pain to separate into the marinade. The ginger root was only a 2\" x 1\" piece because my wife doesn't like the flavor of ginger...next time I'll actually double the root bc the end result was \"really\" weak on ginger flavor. The cider vinegar and soy sauce (reduced sodium) were initially doubled for the marinade however increased to 1c. of each; next time 3/4c bc 1c makes the marinade \"slooshy\". I learned groundnut oil is actually \"peanut oil\" which I actually had. After softening the veggies and browning the meats; everything went into a pre-heated crackpot for the finishing-touch. As with \"anything\" cooked in a crockpot; the condensation level will have to be monitored & removed.  \nA note concerning the jasmine rice used; although old news for most probably; if the rice is covered in water, gently stirred, water carefully poured-off and repeated until the water is \"clear\" removing the outer layer of starch; the cooked rice will become \"sticky rice\" perfectly suitable for this recip",
