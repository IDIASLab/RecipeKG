Sesame oil is super-packed with a nutty flavor (a little goes a long way) and without it the dressing will be entirely different (i.e. bland!) than intended and will have virtually no Asian flavor at all. Great with a handful of toasted almonds tossed in!",

The dressing would be good on any combination of cole slaw ingredients you have on hand but I love the addition of jicama. I added some toasted slivered almonds finely chopped red bell pepper and green onions. I've also just added the dressing to the packaged cole slaw mix with a little chopped jicama. I found that scaling the recipe in half yields enough dressing for one bag of coleslaw mix. Fantastic.",

It was always too strong of a taste for me - I never enjoyed the heaviness and stickiness of it. I've been meaning to find a recipe to make my own slaw dressing that doesn't shock the taste buds and is more refreshing and light and I found the perfect opportunity to finally do it this week when I saw bags of cole slaw on sale. I like to try unique recipes so I decided to use this one. It came out really well everything that I was looking for: not overpowering refreshing and a bit different from the usual slaw dressings. It had a great balance of sweet and tangy but not strong so it also gave a good balance of taste between the dressing and the vegetables. I really enjoyed the hint of a \"nutty\" flavor from the sesame oil and sesame seeds and I absolutely love that this recipe uses honey. The proportion of dressing to salad was perfect in the recipe as well. I did make some minor changes but only because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used white balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar white sesame seeds instead of black and I didn't have jicama. Not sure how much of a difference this made but I was happy with the end result. I made the slaw a day ahead and the flavors blended really well during this time in the fridge. Will make this again!",

First time I have ever used jicama - not sure how necessary it is to this salad - pretty much tasteless to me - mine had the consistancy of a firm pear is the only way i can describe it. So I certainly wouldn't fret if you couldn't find one or didn't want to waste the money. I also couldn't find black sesame seeds so I just used toasted sesame seeds. I used low fat mayo and the dressing was still incredible. This slaw would be great on any kind of bbq sandwich or with a couple crab cakes perched on top which is what I used it for. All I can say is wowzer - will definately use this again.",
