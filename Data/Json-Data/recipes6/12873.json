I added more orange juice and a bit of water because I used a frosting bag and a large frosting tip. The taste is really good for stronger flavor you could try using orange flavoring(don't add too much!!) instead of orange juice. I also melted a bag of chocolate chips in a doubble boiler with 3-4 TBS. of shortning and after it was melted I used some dried mint leaves (from our own garden) chopped them up very fine in the food processor and then put them through a flour sifter and then added that to the melted chocolate and half dipped the cookies.

I had never made spritz cookies before and when I found my grandmother's old cookie press sitting in the kitchen cabinet unused I decided to give it a try. I baked the first batch for 10 minutes--they burned to a crisp! So I reduced the cooking time to about 6 minutes and they turned out a nice barely golden brown. Since I had a bit of trouble adapting to the press most of my cookies were not pretty enough to save for the Christmas platter but my family plans to eat them anyway. I doubled the amount of orange juice and zest and used butter-flavored crisco. You can really taste the orange. Thanks for sharing.",

If you don't have a cookie press or gun roll them into 1\" balls like for peanut butter cookies and press them down with a sugared glass or your hand.
