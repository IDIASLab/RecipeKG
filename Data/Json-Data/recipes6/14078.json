I put them in a small zip bag and put them on top of everything.  I changed the recipe card so that you cream the butter with the sugar package, then add the egg.  Turned out like a normal cookie dough that way.  Thanks for the recipe!!",

It is a dry dough but bakes up soft. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead, I think they made them a bit salty, so I reduced the salt a bit.  I wanted my jars to look fuller. So I layered the ingredients this way, bottom to top, brown sugar, white sugar, flour, nuts, chips, berries, oats, flour, soda, salt.  Also just a note for anyone planning on making a bunch. 12 jars used: 5 lbs flour, 2 lbs oats, 1.5 pkg of brown sugar (32 oz) and 4 pkg chips (12 oz).  I bought the nuts in bulk and bought way too may.  Next time I think I will take my measuring cup to the store.",

To prevent the brown sugar from hardening I mixed the brown and white sugars together before adding them to the jar. They stayed soft over a week before they were made. Another reviewer stated that egg and butter couldn't be creamed so she put the sugar in a packet. Egg and butter CAN be creamed - it just won't look the same as when you cream butter and sugar. It will look how egg and butter look together. Follow the recipe's original directions and you should get a great cookie!",

I just do two things differently when I make them as jar mixes: use Domino Brownulated Sugar to avoid having the sugar get hard in the jar and stick a small crumbled-up piece of wax paper in the top to avoid having the ingredients move around (since the recipe doesn't completely fill the jar.) I cover the top with a small piece of patterned cloth and tie with a ribbon and you can't see the wax paper.",

I printed out the baking directions on cardstock and tied it to the mason jar with rafia.  Taking the advice of another reviewer, I changed the name to \"Cranberries in the Snow\"...sounds more appropriate for the holidays and actually resembles it's name!  Two suggestions, DO NOT pack down the ingedients as some other recipes in a jar require.  This recipe fits in the jar just as it's poured in.  Also, using a wide-mouth jar and a cone made out of paper helps kids (and adults alike) get it all in without any mess.  Oh, used 7 grain flakes 'cause that's what I had, and walnuts instead of pecans (cheaper) and it tasted great! Will make this to give as gifts every year!",
