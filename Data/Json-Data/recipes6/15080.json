The cake alone was wonderful!! It was very light and had a wonderful taste. I didn't do the 3 pans instead I did one 9x13 glass pan increased time to 35 min. I also decreased the cocoa to 1/2 cup as I only had dark chocolate cocoa. When it came out I cut a small piece to try the cake then drizzled the gooey choc. icing on it while both were hot. The gooey soaked right in and what a treat!! Very sweet though. Just how I like it!!!",
