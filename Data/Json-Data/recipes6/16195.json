I used 8 cube steaks, 2 cans of beef broth, 1 can of mushroom soup, one onion (sliced) and 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix. I sprinkled the steaks with pepper and garlic powder and placed in skillet with onion rings to brown on both sides. Meanwhile, I mixed the beef broth, mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix. After meat was browned I placed it and onions in a 9x13, poured the soup mix all over, covered with foil and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes and a salad. These steaks were tender and certainly not dry. The gravy was delicious. A tasty, yet inexpensive meal since I got the steaks for $1.99/lb.",

I coat the meat with flour and seasons of choice and beat the flour mixture into the meat.  THE BEST TIP I EVER GOT: THE MORE FLOUR YOU POUND INTO THE MEAT, THE MORE TENDER THE MEAT WILL BE.  Put onions in with meat to saute after you have turned the meat once.  Use cream of (your favorite) soup along with a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I make this all in a cast iron skillet so I don't have to transfer to another pan or cook in the crock pot.  Covering the dish to cook also helps tenderize the meat.  This works GREAT with venison steaks too or any other steak, be it tough meat or tender.",
