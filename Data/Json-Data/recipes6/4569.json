By doing everything wrong I mean I used olive oil instead of butter, omitted the bacon, increased the amount of thighs, put the whole thighs in instead of pulling the meat off, just used onion and garlic for vegetables, kept the same amount of liquids as for the smaller amount, used a smaller can of cream of chicken soup, used half-and-half instead of full cream, stirred in frozen corn and cooked the whole thing in a wok. It was delicious and kid friendly. My whole family ate it. It took me along time to cook but it requires very little attention. One thing though, it is not one the diet approved list. I can feel my arteries clogging as I type. It is a wonderful easy winter meal. If you are not particularly kitchen skilled (as I am not) you can impress someone with relatively little effort.",

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe but the dumplings were kind of gloppy somehow. This seems like a pretty basic recipe and over all the stew tasted good as I love just about anything with dark meat in it. It was very flavorful, but I thought that it tasted best right after cooking. It did not taste as good as leftovers. My toddler did not like it and my husband passed on it as well. I probably will not make this again due to lukewarm reception by family.",
