I made half w/ butterscoth morsals & half w/ the new cinnamon morsals- YUMMM! I used 100% Pure Pumpkin from Libby. And added a 1/4 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice. The dough is VERY STICKY. I ended up scooping the dough w/ a spoon & putting it in a sm. bowl filled with cinnamon & suger (mixed) after it is well sugered- you can roll w/o sticking:) Everyone at work thought by the smell of these cookies that they were cinnamon bunns-I faked them out! Make sure to SPRAY THE COOKIE SHEET HEAVILY!!! You will definately be baking for a while 12-16 minutes depending on size of cookies. They will look a bit doughy when taking them out- but they are done & ready to eat:P Hope this helps! Happy holidays all!",

Very soft and moist but not gooey or wet. The butterscotch compliments the pumpkin flavor nicely but like other reviewers I cut the butterscotch to somewhere between 3/4 cup and 1 cup which was perfect. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. I increased the cinnamon just a by using a generously rounded teaspoon and used butter since I didn't have shortening. Overall a great cookie. I will definitely be making this again.",
