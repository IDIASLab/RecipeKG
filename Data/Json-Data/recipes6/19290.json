All rice is different and is not as starchy or as absorbable as the rest! I can soak up 6 cups of milk with 1 cup of reg med grain rice..Brown rice takes longer to asborb liquid than thw white rices...Cooking is a chemistry, you have to know what your doing before u start changing things, plus have the experience in doin so.

After simmering in the milk for 20mins it was still really soupy so I decided to just mix in the puree and not layer.  Cooked for 60 mins, stirring every 20mins and it came out beautiful.",
