After that I followed the original recipe except I added crushed red peppers and Italian seasoning. I served this with fettuccine alfredo and roasted asparagus on the side. Delizioso!",

However, that being said I think it would be an easy recipe to trim down with turkey bacon rather than regular, and then using a bit of cooking spray or veg. oil instead of the grease.  You could also substitute light cheese.  \n\nAs is though, this is a great recipe.  The sweet onion topping went great with the salty bacon & cheese.  Highly recommend trying this one.",
