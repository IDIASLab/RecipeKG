                "reviewBody": "These were a disappointment. My concept of gingersnaps is a rather flat crispy cookie with a lot of \"snap\" when you bite into them. These exit the oven with the same shape as you put them in with. What you see is exactly what you get. I followed the instructions and flattened slightly. Wrong. They come out too thick and instead of the crisp they're just plain dry. Maybe flattening them more would help but that's only a guess. Additionally there is not enough ginger flavor. Gingersnaps are supposed to have a spicy \"bite.\" These don't come close. Even doubling the amount of that ingredient and rolling in sugar laced with more ginger didn't help. They needed more \"kick.\" I suspect that decreasing the amount of flour back to 2 cups adding a tsp of soda and increasing the ginger to 1 Tb might help. However that's a little too labor intensive to suit me. I'm going to cut my losses on this one and keep up my quest for the perfect gingersnap.",
