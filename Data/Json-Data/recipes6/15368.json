From other reviews it seemed the coffee liqueur wasn't apparent anyway so I thought I'd try another liqueur I don't use often - Tres Leches. Frankly I don't know if it would make any difference to the cookie whether you used your liqueur of choice (Frangelico Amaretto or Bailey's maybe?) or even just milk - or no liquid at all for that matter which would result in a sturdier dough. While maybe not my favorite it is nonetheless a respectable chocolate chip cookie.",

I barely noticed the coffee flavor but still really enjoyed these. I'm thinking of adding walnuts next time. I upped the amount of liqueur by a tablespoon (for a total of four) and added a smidgen more flour to compensate for the extra moisture. Can't wait to make these again and experiment with different flavorings! UPDATE: I made these again and halved the cinnamon which we enjoyed more than with the suggested amount.",

Instead of liqueur I took two tablespoons of freshly finely ground Ethiopian coffee and mixed it into 2 tablespoons of very hot water and let stand for a few minutes before adding to the batter mix to bring out more of the coffee taste. I also supplemented the standard semi-sweet baking chocolate chips (not milk chocolate) with Ghirardelli's 60% Cacao baking chips but only used 2 cups of chips total. To my taste this combination provided plenty of coffee as well as deep chocolate flavor. I have taste-tested the results on three people so far and the results have been very flavorable.;-) Will definitely make them again with different combinations of coffee and chocolate.",
