I chose this receipe simply because I had a whole chicken, not a lot of time, and needed to cook it.  I have NO idea why the combination of these ingredients or this cooking method (I followed it EXACTLY as written, but used real butter) yields such a wonderfully TASTY bird...but it does!  If you don't try this, you're missing out. If you do try this, I venture to say that, you will be very pleasantly surprised!",

I sliced 8 garlic cloves and put in cavity, under skin and on top YUM!  I also sliced 2 small lemons and put one in cavity and the other on top.  Put 1/4 cup butter in cavity and 1/4 cup sliced butter on top. Put cut celery in cavity, and then salt/peppered all over. Roasted for 2 hours - turned out perfect.  The GRAVY was AWESOME!!  Some flour with the oils, then chicken broth and all the browned bits from the pan and juices from carving.  This was my first roast chicken.  Will make over and over!!",

For my seasoning I used garlic powder (instead of onion) and lots of salt and pepper both on the outside, and in the cavity. Next time I will probably add some rosemary. The other recipe called for stuffing the cavity with lemon slices and garlic gloves. The flavours were great, and it turned out really juicy. Thank you for this recipe :)",
