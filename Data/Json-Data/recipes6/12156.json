I found the dough to be sticky and hard to roll I would suggest pressing half of the mix onto the pan in the shape you want leaving an edge that rises slightly the whole way around try to keep your sugar from going outside the edge and cover completly with second half of mix. Any sugar that is uncovered during the cooking process will be grainy and unmelted. The recipe didnt say what to do with the almond slices so I sprinkled them on top. I also had to cook it longer than suggested.",

The taste is 5 stars but challenging to roll out. I tried rolling hand patting....sticky wicket. Finally I rolled out onto a heavily floured countertop and then cut the rectangle into 3 strips. With a spatula I lifted the strips onto the cookie sheet otherwise they would have fallen apart. One other change was I put 1/2 of the sugar mixture into the dough. I just didn t like the idea of no sweetness in the shortbread part of this dish. I think I would make again now that I ve figured out how to transfer the dough. Good luck YUMMY!",
