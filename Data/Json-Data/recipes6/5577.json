I put two 10oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies (I omitted the red pepper flakes) onion garlic extra chicken broth and a can of black beans with all the spices and meat into the slow cooker on low for six hours. I added in the zucchini and summer squash removed the chicken breasts and shred them on a plate with two forks stirred them back in and cooked it for another two hours. Came out delightfully moist and flavorful. No need to thicken it up at all. Wonderful and lo-carb friendly. I will be making this again. Thanks!",
