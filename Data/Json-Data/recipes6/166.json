I'm wondering if maybe the whisky didn't get reduced long enough. If you reduce it it doesn't render a whole lot but the glaze thickened up nicey. If you add the whisky before reducing it will be runny. I also always marinate my pork in Coca-cola. It tenderizes pork beautifully. Discard the marinade before baking for this recipe.",

I did put a little more honey in the glaze at the start as it was a little too vinegary for my husband. regardless it was great. I just basted the chops about every ten minutes kept the remainder of the liquid warm and served that as a dipping sauce. I also served cubed baked sweet potatoes and before serving I poured some of the liquid in those as well. It was delicious. My husband is a light picky eater and even had seconds.
