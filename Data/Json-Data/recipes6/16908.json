Those changes aside, this is a wonderful recipe.  Lovely with a scoop of ice cream.  One other minor issue is that the chocolate chips like to sink to the bottom.  Next time I may put half the bread mixture into the pan, add a layer of chocolate chips, add the rest of the custard, then the rest of the chips.",

Then I read the recipe and saw that there was only one measly cup of chocolate chips in the recipe.  I searched further and found another recipe that was needlessly complicated, but it had one idea I liked, and that was to toss the dry bread cubes with 1/4 cup of melted butter, and then toss that with the 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of cocoa.  I increased the bread to 6 cups, and the milk to 3 cups.  I added vanilla and one more banana, then baked this in a 9 by 9 baking pan for 35 minutes.  It came out beautifully, rich and chocolaty, but not really too close to the original recipe.  It needed way more chocolate to satisfy my craving.  Oh, I also used one whole package of chocolate chips instead of one cup.",

Breakfast of champions.  Bet it'll be really good with maple syrup, like a banana pancake.  (I wouldn't recommend syrup with the full amount of sugar though, it'd probably taste like a lollipop.)",

I added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg which gave it depth and, although I am a huge chocolate fan, I would have preferred raisins to chocolate chips in this bread pudding.  I also mashed up an extra banana in the egg and milk mixture.  This made the pudding even moister and gave more banana flavor.  I will definately be making this again.",
