I was a little hesitant about \"liberably\" salting the tomatoes, as we are both on low sodium diets.  But I took the leap and this recipe is one that definitely requires  salting the tomatoes. I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar to my bowl,  and that just took it over the top for me.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.",

It gives me SO much more control!!!  Also, I made the tomato chunks smaller, since most salad offerings are cut too large for some folks!
