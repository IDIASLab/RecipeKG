I didn't have chicken so I subbed some tofu. I just -really- disliked the canned button mushrooms. I picked them ALL out and replaced them with fresh button mushrooms that I chopped and sauteed in a pan before adding to the completed soup. Any fresh mushroom would be better than the straw ones which are kind of slimy and have a weird taste. I think this soup would be better with the chicken for sure but the tofu was nice in a pinch and the rest of the flavors were out of this world.",

I boiled the unpeeled shrimp in water before adding to soup and used a cup of the shrimp stock (strained). I added a strip of lime peel because I couldn\u2019t find kefir line leaves. I used cilantro rather than basil because I made it with shrimp. I used 2 tsp of Thai red curry paste & a Tbsp of Thai sweet red Chile sauce. I omitted onion and used 2 inch of peeled, sliced galanga instead of ginger (more authentic taste), 2 lemongrass stalks & fresh mixed mushrooms from the market (selection of fresh Asian mushrooms). After cooking soup with the spices and herbs, I strained the soup before adding vegetables & mushrooms. I added a small handful of matchstick carrots with a medium zucchini sliced & quartered. I added the peeled, cooked shrimp & 3 Tbsp of lime juice to soup at the end, to avoid tough shrimp & bitterness caused by boiling the lime juice. The result was nicely spicy but not too spicy. If your guests like more heat, they can add crushed red pepper flakes after serving the soup. Garnish soup with some whole cilantro leaves (or basil if making with chicken). Very good and tasted like Thai restaurant quality.",
