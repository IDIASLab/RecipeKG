(also we sifted powdered sugar on top of both batches of cookies which helped both:D) we will make these again",

I will save this and make it again but I gave 4 stars because I made some adjustments. First I couldn't get my dough to come together so I had to add a little water probably 1-2TB (maybe I used too small of an egg?). To the melted butter I cooled it then beat in the egg and added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Lastly after baking them I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. Overall I enjoy the texture - not as crumbly as I expected from a shortbread especially considering how crumbly they were going into the oven; also they are a little chewy! Very good simple cookie.

To those commenting that it is too dry this cookie is really meant to be on the dry side like polvoron if you have tasted one. This is a crumbly kind of cookie; not a cake. The one comment I have on this recipe is that you dont sift the egg togther with the dry ingrdients. Sift all dry indridients first then the egg then a trickle of water or vanilla essence to help bind the mixture. Useda bit more extra sugar",
