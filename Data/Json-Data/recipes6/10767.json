It's easy to make, with ingredients always on hand, and mildly spiced to please the whole family.  I use Grandma's Molasses (which appears dark - I'm not sure what \"light molasses\" is). You can double the amounts of ginger and cinnamon if you prefer a spicier cake. This truly is \"good old-fashioned gingerbread\"!!",

No more brownies for us!\n\n**Note** I'm coming back to update my review.  I just read the other reviews that talk about this cake being dry.  I don't understand that.   Perhaps they missed adding the water?  Maybe they're cooking it too long?  This truly is so moist that it is really a cake, not a bread.  I've made it repeatedly and it's great every time.",
