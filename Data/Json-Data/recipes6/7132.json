But, it has good flavor.  \n\nMade as written except that I didn't have a golden delicious apple on hand.  I think I used a gala apple, and it was at the end of it's shelf-life (last one in the bowl), so probably would have been sweeter with the correct, not overly ripe, apple.  Instead of mashing some of the squash, I blended it all into a puree, like most squash soup seems to be.",
