I have tasted a similar version from one of our local Italian bakeries and had been searching for this recipe forever. I have added melted chocolate to the batter and it turned out quite well. Unlike the previous poster my cookies didn't spread at all which to me is wrong as I think they actually SHOULD come out flat and thin. As to the skinless hazelnuts I chopped mine in half in anticipation of the cookies coming out flat and roasted them in the oven and the skin just peeled right off. If you like nutty cookies this is a must try.",
