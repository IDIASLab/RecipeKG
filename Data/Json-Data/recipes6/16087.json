I added onion and bell peppers to mine and had better pickles than my old recipe with much more ease of preperation.  Everyone loves them, and you can't find anything close to this tasty in a store. I bought a gallon jug of dill pickles at Sam's and packed mine in plastic storage containers in the refrigerator. They go quick.",
