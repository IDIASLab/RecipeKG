It's not a technique that kids can handle very well and even adults have trouble keeping the layers very very thin. You might want to add the \"paint in very thin washes\" instruction.",

This worked great - NO BAD SMELL and TASTES great. One recipe makes enough to decorate 60 cookies. I mixed the egg and water and then separated it into 5 small bowls to add desired color(s). It brushed on easily (I don't know how you could make it too thick it is a very thin wash). I then added colored sprinkles/colored sugar and baked. The result was quick and pretty cookies that tasted great too. I baked the cookies on parchment paper I used one sheet for all the cookies - no stains or any problems like others complained of. Definitely recommend for kids of all ages. This would also be great to use as a base and then add piped icing designs after the cookies are baked.",

The egg yolk tempra (which my son loved to easily paint on the unbaked cookies) ran off the cookies. I didn't wipe it off the baking sheet. While baking it sure didn't smell like cookies but eggs in a frying pan with the heat up too high...very distinct cooking egg smell to my kitchen. After the cookies were baked I had to use a very sharp knife to \"trim\" the cooked egg yolk/water mixture off the cookies. The \"frosting\" cracked and didn't look pretty. It did not change the taste of my cookies at all. I probably wouldn't ever use this recipe again but I would encourage someone else to try it to see if they had better luck than me. I'm just glad I have another day to bake cookies to take to the Christmas play.",
