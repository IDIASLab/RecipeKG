I think of it as a 'snack' cake good for lunch boxes and great with a cup of coffee for breakfast. I used 2 cups white whole wheat flour and 2 cups AP and it was still a very moist cake and slightly healthier version. I cut back on the sugar to 1 and 2/3 cup still sweet enough for us. I also added a bit of salt. I thought maybe I should add some vanilla but it is just fine without it. Next time I might bake it in a jelly roll pan...this cake is very tall and takes near an hour to bake. In spite of that extra cooking time the cake did not dry out on the edges or the top at all. One more thing...I would suggest baking this a day ahead...it is so much better today and it slices much easier too. Love this cake!",
