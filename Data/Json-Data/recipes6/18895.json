Like near White Fish Point near Brimley, Michigan in the beautiful Upper Penninsula.\n\nI only have one extra comment on a comment.  PLEASE DO NOT COOK AT HIGHER HEAT as one suggested.  Fish do not need to be cooked at such high heat....an even 350*to 375* is perfect.  when fish is done, the coating turns brown, even in oil.  You do not want to over cook the outer, before the inner is done, or that \"fishy\" taste will come through.  be sure to skin it and remove the grey fat layer and blood line from it.  that is where any bacteria and fishy taste comes from, especially if it has been frozen.  take it from a 67 year old White Fish fisherman and connoisseur of fish chef......",

I've ommitted the cayenne, used several different types of nuts and even none at all, used different mustards, sweetened coconut and black pepper, etc. Also, instead of baking it, I've pan fried it slowly until it turns crispy and golden. My husband is not a fish fan being from a state that doesn't get it very fresh while I crave seafood. We BOTH love this recipe and usually wish we had made more after it's done. Also, no matter the alterations, it's always tasty although the original is great as well.",

I followed the directions exactly and while the catfish came out perfect I personally felt like the brown mustard was a little overpowering. I had to spoon my curry onto the fish to help mask the strong mustard aroma. It did the trick and the coconut fish complimented the curry very well but I don't think I could have eaten it by itself. I also was slightly put off by the texture the batter was soft coming out of the oven- not crispy. Of course I should have known better considering that this was oven baked and not fried.
