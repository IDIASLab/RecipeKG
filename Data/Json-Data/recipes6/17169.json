This kept all of the flavor and just made it less oily. Make sure you constantly stir those almonds and as soon as they are slightly brown get them out... they can burn quickly. I recommend spraying a small dish with cooking spray to pour the almonds on and allow to cool before breaking up otherwise the sugar makes them stick to the surface. Recommend using 1/2 red onion- a whole onion just seems to be too much. I also added dried cranberries and used bagged green romaine lettuce. Delicious!",

Cook on low heat and stir often for 5-8 minutes, cool quickly when they brown;  they come out wonderful!  I make extra to snack on later because they are THAT good! Another thing I do is soak the chopped onions first, as it reduces the OVER-ONIONED flavor and throw the entire dressing (along with the pre-soaked and drained onions) into the blender.   The dressing comes out perfect!",

I didn't add the celery (personal preference) used green lettuce rather than red and halved the entire recipe. As most salads of this sort (in my opinion) it doesn't necessarily keep very well so don't toss the dressing until you're almost ready to serve. Wonderful! Thanks!:)",
