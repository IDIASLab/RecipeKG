I use this in Chef John's no-knead artisan in place of the commercial yeast (remove yeast, add 75g start, stir the start into the warm water before adding to the flour) and it is delicious.  \n\nFor feeding, i use 50g/50g flour/water (this is 1/3 cup with my flour and sifting method).  Keeping a living start 24/7 eats through some flour.  \n\nPS.  I named mine Ichibod Grain.  oh yes, i did.  enjoy that.",
