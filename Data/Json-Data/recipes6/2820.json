If I were to make this recipe again I d probably add more ginger and maybe even more molasses since I thought the ginger cookie flavor was weak. Unfortunately I didn t like the glaze AT ALL. If you want iced ginger cookies or even a drizzle on them as I did I d recommend you use orange juice because the orange extract was too strong and just tasted artificial simply not good. I drizzled the glaze on a few cookies tasted one and threw away the rest of the glaze. These cookies were OK but I doubt I ll make them again. racahoon sorry wish I had a better review for you but thanks for sharing your recipe.",
