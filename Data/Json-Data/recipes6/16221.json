Instead of adding the whole peeled tomatoes I used a 14.5 oz. can of petite diced toamtoes and since I like thing a little thicker I added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I also added a couple splashes of wine 1 tsp. of oregano and 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes vs. white sugar. Other than those additions this was perfect over angel hair pasta!",

It would be great for spaghetti (which is what it was made for). But I wouldn't try using it as a pizza sauce or anything like that unless I were to thicken it up first.",
