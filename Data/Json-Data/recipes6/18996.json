I mixed a cup and a half of sugar with probably 20 raspberries and a small amount of strawberry extract. I added two tablespoons of honey and a half a cup of brown sugar. I then added 3/4s cup of water and boiled it over the stove. After it was boiling I whisked it so the raspberries broke up into just the seeds. When it was starting to foam I turned the heat off and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile I put a cup of lime juice into a standard sized container and added 7 cups of water. Then I added about a tablespoon of honey and let that dissolve in it. I added 6 slices of lemon. After that sat as long as the loose syrup on the stove I strained the syrup. This takes out all of the raspberry seeds so you don't have to chew them. Then I poured it into the container with the lime juice lemons and water mixed it up and served it right away in a glass of ice. The family raved. I found this is really tasty and only slightly deviating from your basic recipe. Try it out! It's really good. Thanks for the idea/recipe!!",
