During the energy crisis in times of economic strife etc. In addition to the corn syrup peanut butter (always the crunchy variety) and brown sugar I add about a 1/4-1/2 c of maple syrup. I add a half c of peanuts but I run them through the chopper first to create tiny pieces rather than big crunchier ones. I don't add extra salt (lots on the roasted peanuts) and I don't add extra butter. The peanut butter provides more than enough fat for me. Truly a great Canadian recipe fantastic to take to potlucks of for a really fast fix for dinner. (I'd better go make mine nowmmm",
