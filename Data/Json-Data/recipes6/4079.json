This easy oven dish only needs one other pot to reduce the sauce on top of the stove. It is large enough for a crowd or for leftovers later in the week. Add a green veggie or a salad, and some crusty dinner bread, and you are good to go!",

                "reviewBody": "OMG this was soooo good. Leftovers were good too. I made some changes only because I bought a 3.8 pound top pork loin on sale for 8 instead of the 1.9 pound pork tenderloin for 16. So I had to go to my good old Betty Crocker cookbook and to the internet to get cooking times. Did all of the ingredients the same except left off garlic and doubled all the ingredients and increased apple cider to 2 cups. I did the rub ahead of time because I was home anyway and let it sit under a blanket of plastic rap for 4 hours before cooking. Betty Crocker said to cook Top Pork Loin at 325 for 30-40 mins per pound to get internal temp of 170. I cooked it for a total of about 2 hours at 350 with just the cider mix (no sweets or apples). Also had to look up Sweet Potatos = 350 degrees for about an hour. So added them after Pork loin cooked for one hour. And I looked up Apples = 350 for about 15 minutes (I did smaller slices - like 8/apple). Even though I did over cook it a smidge when I made the first cut liquid squirted out and I knew it would be juicy and tender which it was. For leftovers we put potoatoes/apples/juice in sauce pan on low. And my husband dabbed some of the juice on the pork slices and put brown sugar/ginger mix on each side. He cooked them separately in the oven on stoneware plate at 350 for about 7 minutes then broiled at 500 until a little bubbly - a couple minutes.",
