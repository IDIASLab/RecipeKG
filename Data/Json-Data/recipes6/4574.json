I didn't bother grating the tempeh but just chunked it - it naturally fell apart during the cooking process. I used vegetable bouillon plus water instead of broth and then added cracked pepper at the very end before I let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours.",

The recipe is very easy to modify; for example if you prefer pickle relish or bread and butter pickles to dill you can certainly substitute. I have also added green pepper for extra crunch as well as kalamata olives. Additionally...I myself don't like mayonnaise so I substitute 1/4 c. olive oil. I just tried pulsing the tempeh in a food processor after simmering it and before adding the other ingredients. The texture is smoother that way.",
