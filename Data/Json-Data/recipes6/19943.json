I followed the first batch exactly (just adding mini choc chips) and it was very watery and stickly like others said. The taste was ok but nothing special. I probably would of been fine w/ it but it didn't make that much specially after everyone picked at it to give it a try. So I decided to make another batch and this time I tried out the suggestions. OMG Everyone LOVED the second batch!!!! My kids didn't even want to use the first batch anymore so I threw it out. The second batch not only tasted better but it also came out more like cookie dough and it wasn't sticky at all. I doubled the recipe so we could pick at it and still have plently to add to my vanilla icecream. This is how I made it: 5 TBS BROWN SUGAR, 6 TBS SUGAR, 4 TBS BUTTER SOFTENED, 1 TEAS VANILLA, 3 TBS WHOLE MILK, 1 CUP FLOUR, 1/2 TEAS SALT, 1/2 CUP MINI CHOC CHIPS. This was enough to make 24 small melon ball size of chunks that I've put in the freezer.. When ready to add to my icecream I just cut each ball into forths and it was the perfect cookie dough chunk. Definatly try this out.. I can see how this would be addicting.. I can go into the freezer at any time and take out a small ball and eat it... Ummmmmm",

Based on the other reviews these are the modifications that I made: I doubled the amount of vanilla 1 1/2 TB milk instead of water 2 TB of brown sugar and I added a little over a 1/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips. When completely mixed I wrapped it in plastic wrap rolled it in a log and froze it. I then sliced up the log (how you would for slice and bake cookies) and quartered each slice. Amazing!",

Well after tweaking it just a little I've found that what it's missing is some salt and a little baking soda (that's what really makes it taste like \"normal\" cookie dough). I also used milk instead of water but used less of it the second time around just until it had the right consistency. With these changes it was definitely a 5-star recipe - I couldn't tell the difference between that and regular cookie dough! It's kind of dangerous actually;-)",

I did however only use only 1 1/2 tablesooon of brown sugar becuase we are running low on it right now. I also used 1 tablespoon of water because alot had said it was too wattery. My cookie dough turned out perfect. Call me a pig but I think it is the perfect curl up on the couch on a rainny Saturday and pop in your fav DVD type of snack.
