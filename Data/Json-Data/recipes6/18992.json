Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando turkey legs are my favorite, not that they are any better mind you, I just like being at WDW and UO when I eat one!\n\nOne thing all these legs have in common is that they taste like ham. I've tried this recipe. It is good but not what we are looking for. The only way to get turkey to taste like ham is to cure it and smoke it. All the soda pop and spices in the world will not render the same flavor and texture as what we want and get from \"those\" places.",

It has a nice bite to it but not overwhelming. The turkey was moist and tender but the grill was a mess:) Don't change a thing!",
