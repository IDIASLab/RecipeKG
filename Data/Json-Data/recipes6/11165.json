I made strawberry blackberry blueberry and raspberry all with the same flavored yogurt as the fruit I used. They are so easy to make and look like I spent a lot more time on them than I did. They are so pretty on a tray and very moist. We loved them so I will be making them quit often now. Thanks!!",

Also always substitue butter or oil in EVERY muffin recipe and subsituted with whatever low fat yoghurt I have in the fridge (in this case it was mango/peach. Additions were 1/2 cup of cranberries and /2 cup of walnuts & 1 tsp of vanilla. I made this recipe twice and changed my cranberries/walnuts to 1/2 cup of dark choc. chips and 1/2 cup of dessicated coconut and sprinkled extra on top of each muffin. Great basic recipe. Sometimes I don't bother with plain flour & baking powder and use self raising flour which has both ingredients in one. Of course I will make these again they look great taste great too!
