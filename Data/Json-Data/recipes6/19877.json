I would definitely recommend going for quality chocolate on this one. Also i used one can of cherry pie filling (21 oz) in addition another 15oz frozen bag of black cherries. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the frozen cherries with a little bit of corn starch a splash of water and almond extract. I also then poured the can of pie filling into the pan with the other cherries to make the flavor more uniform. I sprinkled sliced almonds over the top and added some extra chocolate chips to the batter. I think overall it was amazing. Everyone at the dinner party i went to raved about it. I got comments like \"Oh my gosh this is gourmet!\" and \"I can't believe you made this!\" The only thing i would do differently next time is to not add the extra chocolate chips to the batter. I think that it made it very rich which i actually do love but that it is yummy enough without them. I think that adding the extra cherries was imperative though and made the dish perfect. It still fit in a 2-quart casserole dish. I will make this again for sure!",
