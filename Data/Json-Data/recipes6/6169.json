I can't stress how perfect it is to any reader, but truly I never follow a recipe 100% and I made NO changes to this one.  I even measured most things (which I never do) and it was PERFECT.  I added extra crushed red pepper because we like spice and the recipe calls for just enough for one to taste the flavor of the red pepper, but not enough for a kick.  I would recommend using unsalted butter at the end, since the capers and the olives provide plenty of salt to the recipe.  I also added whatever fresh veggies I had in my garden.  Thank you for this perfect recipe.  I have not found a better recipe on this site.",

Half the amount would have been more than enough. I stuck to the recipe exactly, and hubby and I were both very pleased. The simmering brings all the flavors together nicely. I actually liked the sauce better than the fish (I did use sea bass), as I didn't particularly care for the filets poached. Were I to make this again I would pan roast the filets--I missed that beautiful golden color and semi-crispy exterior. I served this over a bed of Saffron Rice,accompanied with Cuban Black Beans I and Jicama Salad with Cilantro and Lime, all recipes from this site. A pretty, delicious and interesting Cuban style dinner!",

I didn't have wine so I substituted vermouth but no doubt it is just as good if not better with the wine. I served with white rice black beans and fried plantains - cuban style! This is one of if not the best recipes I have ever made. I can't wait to show off with it.:) Thank you so much for sharing.",
