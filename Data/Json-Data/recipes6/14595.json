No mace, just cinnamon. I have also used curry powder, most yummy and nice mid year change from the cinnamon. \nAlso, I don't melt the butter, I just put pieces of butter on top. Best of all this can be put together the day before, store in fridge and simply let come to room temp before placing in the oven. Even the kids will eat it with the apples. \nEnjoy-",
