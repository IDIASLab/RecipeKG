Each one by themselves isn't good but if you get both in a bite it's good. We used 99 bananas as the vodka to give it that strawberry banana flavor. It flambeed great and definitely was a crowd pleaser. Served little sundaes in martini glasses. Eat immediately or it all melts into a soupy mess. Next time I will cool the strawberries a bit.",
