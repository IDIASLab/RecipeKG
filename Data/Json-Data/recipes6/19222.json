I had a bite and it was really tasty. I did cook it about 10 min longer than called for and some of the butter/moisture from the topping bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven (which I guess I have to clean anyways) but all in all excellent and easy pie. My family couldn't believe it came from canned pears! Thank you Tanya!!",
