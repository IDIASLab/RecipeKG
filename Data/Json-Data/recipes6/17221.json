I used brown sugar to deepen the color and I bought brown sugar cured bacon. I simmered it for about 40 minutes on the stove and added water as needed but some of the bacon on the bottom got a little caramelized which really sent it over the top. I added about a tbsp of apple cider vinegar at the end just to balance out the sweet. BF and I loved it! Even better the next day!",
