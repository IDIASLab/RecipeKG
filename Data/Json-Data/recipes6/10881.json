I do remember that my mother never did anything with the topping until after the cake was baked she would put the topping on after the cake was baked then popped it back in the oven and broiled it. It always came out wonderful. I will try this recipe and see if it is the same as my Mothers. Thank You so Very Much for posting this recipes. God Bless.",

I also mixed together the mayo and sugar together and added everything into this. I don't know if this made a difference but our cake came out moist not heavy & dense. But it isn't a light and airy cake either. I cut it into small squares and served at my hubby's staff holiday party. Everyone loved it and a few ladies asked for the recipe. I omitted the nuts too and lightly floured my pan.",
