The can of Veg-All I had in the cupboard did not spoil the lovely flavors at all but improved them. As Asians sometimes do I made a garnish of egg strip. My speed method was to whip 3 eggs add salt and pepper microwave 2 minutes lift to allow egg to nuke uniformly cook 2 minutes more and slice in 1/4 inch slices. SO....this accidentally turned into an entree. We're filing in _favorites_. Thank you very very much Laurie for this rare swift and easy GOOD recipe!",
