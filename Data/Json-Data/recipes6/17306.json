I have tried some of the other popular banana bread recipes on this site but always went back to my wonderful old standby. I decided to give this one a try and I am SO GLAD I did! It came out of the oven smelling heavenly and I cut a slice right away (burned my mouth eating it too!). THIS IS EXCELLENT! I did make a couple of changes--I used 1/3 cup canola oil for the shortening (healthier) and I used all brown sugar because I like when the cake looks darker. Those changes worked out just fine! I think the oat flour adds an interesting flavor. Thanks sooooo much Verona!",

It made for a very deep cake that didn't cook in the middle. I left it in the oven for 15 extra minutes and the edges were getting a little too dark by the time the center was cooked enough. Since the directions mentioned vanilla even though the ingredient list did not I added 1 tsp. I also used butter instead of shortning - just a personal preference. My biggest quibble was with the topping - way too much and way too dry. I'd cut everything to 1/3 but the butter. With those adjustments I would definitely make this again.",
