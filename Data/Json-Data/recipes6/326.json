        "description": "This is a hearty, thick soup with a little bit of heat from the curry. I've used this combination of vegetables a few times with great success, but using earthy tubers, taproots, and alliums is the key, so try different things. For this recipe, you'll need a large skillet or wok, a medium saucepan, and a food processor or blender. I enjoy spicy foods, so you may want to reduce pepper and curry amounts. I used half milk and half cream once and got a very nice creamy soup, but some may prefer the thinner consistency of using only milk. This recipe can be adjusted for vegan palettes by using an olive oil substitute for the butter, coconut or soy milk, and an anchovy-free Worcestershire sauce. Balsamic vinegar can do in a pinch.",
