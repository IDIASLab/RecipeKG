I did not add anything to it but decided to see how it would turn out. Sure enough it did. However instead of dropping teaspoon fulls onto the baking sheet I used a more creative approach. I found a medium sized heart cookie cutter sprayed it with pam and placed it on the baking sheet and filled it with the meringue. I smoothed the top then slid the cookie cutter away from the meringue and the meringue held its shape through cooking. My advice though wait until they are completely cool to handle because they will break and the chocolate will cause a mess so just be patient until they cool.",

I also added appx 1 cup of flaked coconut! They were fantastic! My husband said they were addictive and my son said they were awesome! They disappeared quickly! The chocolate and coconut were great together! The parchment paper really made for easy cleanup! Thanks for such a wonderful post! We'll be making these often! Next time I may also add 1T cocoa powder for a chocolate overload!",

I added 4 tbs of sugar into the ones without chocolate; they were just perfect crunchy on the outside and a tiny bit chewy within perfect. I thought the chocolate ones were a bit on the rich side though and I used less than the recipe called for. Maybe it's because I ran out of chocolate chips and used chunks instead.
