I altered it a bit by adding only 2 TBLS of molasses (it was all I had left) and I used 1 TBLS brown sugar to help add more flavor due to my lack of molasses. Finally I left out the last addition of oats. Despite all of my alterations this made a beautiful loaf. Also I only made the dough in my machine and baked it in a regular loaf pan in the oven so its perfect for sandwiches. Yum! Thanks McReynolds!",

The measurements were spot-on this didn't need any extra flour to get it to jump on the hook. I kneaded it with the hook for five minutes then set it to rise in a greased bowl on my warm oven. The took forever to rise and when I went to form the bread it formed really easy it was just pissy dough to work with. It fell easily. 30 minutes in a 350 oven and it was good to go. Great flavor quite chewy. I plan on serving it with Hearty Bacon and Ranch Potato Soup. I'd make this again.",
