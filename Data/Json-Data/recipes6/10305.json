Just follow the directions and let your bread machine do its work. I set my machine for the dough cycle then take the dough out shape it place it in a 9X5 pan then bake at 375 degrees for 33 minutes exactly.I just sit back and wait for a pefect loaf every time!Thanks Debbie. I will make this again and again and again.....;0)",

We make the dough in the bread machine then divide the dough into 2 bread pans. Then we cover it with plastic plastic wrap and put it to rise in the refrigerator overnight. By morning it is perfect for baking in the oven (350 for 35 min 'til internal temp of 190 degrees). Also it's the perfect recipe for white bread. Just substitute white bread flour for the rye. Thanks very much for sharing this great recipe. Love the sour rye flavor!",
