The only caveat was that the blueberries leaked through the springform pan (likely because I had to use frozen) and the bottom of my oven was a bubbling ashy mess when it was all said and done. My suggestion just in case is to put a layer of aluminum foil under the springform pan to collect any juices that might leak out. Otherwise this was a wonderful recipe and the whipped cream was a great addition!",

I also used lemon juice instead of lemon zest so maybe that changed things. Mine baked in 50 minutes also. The top was good but I wish I had used frozen instead of my freshly-picked berries because it kind of just tasted like I had spread blueberry preserves all over it. I think the \"Plum Blueberry Upside Down Cake\" on this site has a much better texture and presentation.",

I used sweetener ( both brown and white) and my husband and brother went back for seconds and thirds and didn't even know the difference.

I also used half and half instead of milk. I did not have a problem with it being dry but it is dense and the crumb is very coarse. I'm thinking some additional butter or perhaps some oil would lighten it up a bit. I did use frozen berries which were nice but next time I think I will use less flour and sugar as the topping was very very thick as others mentioned.
