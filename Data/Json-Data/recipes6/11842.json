I used margarine instead of shortening (just make sure it's cold when you put it in) only 1/2 cup of coconut (perfect amount - 2 cups would have been WAY too much) and I used Southern Comfort for the bourbon. Turned out great! We enjoyed it topped with vanilla ice cream.",

I used brown sugar (IMHO bourbon and brown sugar are a taste combo made in Heaven!) and sweetened coconut but they weren't quite sweet enough to make up for the flat tasting crust. The bourbon added a great little accent to the overall flavor though. I'm giving it two stars only because I can see the potential if I were to add powdered sugar to the crust and use butter instead of shortning (omitting the salt if using salted butter). I'll probably make it again but I'll tweak the recipe.",
