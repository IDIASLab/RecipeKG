My only gripe is that the prep time is a lot longer than stated. I knew it would be as I wanted to take the extra time too to cut things up nice and small so it would be visually appealing. The pasta also holds up great with this dressing. Definitely make the night before so all of the flavors have a chance to really soak in.",
