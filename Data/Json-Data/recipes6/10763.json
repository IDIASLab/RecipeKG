This is dense and rich but oh so yummy. I cut the coconut and pecans in half for both the cake and the frosting and it was perfect and saved a lot of unnecessary calories. I also used sour cream in place of the buttermilk. I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and added 4 oz cream cheese. Not runny OR too sweet just right!! This is a keeper thanks!",

Its moist, not too dense to be a cake (its much fluffier!), and has the most perfect combination of flavors. Oh yeah, i used macadamia nuts instead of whatever they used and i chopped it up so i get a little bit of crunch in ever bite! The coconut gives it a subtle kick from the regular banana cake/bread... i love it!\nAlso, since everyone said the frosting was too sweet, i only used 2.5 cups of sugar and it turned out great because the sweetness isn't overpowering compared to the banana flavor. I also sprinkled the coconut flakes and nuts on top of the frosting instead of mixing it in......\nI LOVE IT!",

I cut the coconut and pecans to 3/4 cup added an extra banana used sour cream instead of buttermilk and used rum extract instead of vanilla. Also I used a bundt pan and baked it for 50 min. I also used rum extract in the frosting. The frosting is very good but very sweet. I'll probably just make a glaze for it next time because the frosing was too sweet and it was hard to frost the bundt cake. Can't wait to try it with the glaze!",

I agree with the review posted 10/10/07 it is disappointing to go to the time and effort of baking a cake only to end up with banana bread (or snack cake). Even though I am a coconut lover I didn't think the coconut added anything at all to either the cake or the frosting. Both the cake and the frosting were too sweet for our tastes. Also the directions could have been more descriptive. 1) \"Bake 45 to 50 minutes\" most likely applies when baking in a 9\" x 13\" pan not 9\" round cake pans (although recipe directions say either can be used). I used the 9\" round cake pans; set the timer for 30 minutes; and checked on at 20 minutes. Cakes were already pulling away from pan and were done using touch test. 2) \"3 ripe bananas mashed\" would have been better if stated how many cups of mashed bananas as bananas vary in size so much. 3) Step 4 of recipe directions does not say anything regarding when to remove cake from pan. I removed after 10 minutes and cooled the rest of the way on cooling racks.",
