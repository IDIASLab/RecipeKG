I didn't use especially tart apples but even had I done that this would have been too sweet. Next time if I make this again (because I loved the mix of spices...the flavor was excellent there)I will cut the sugar back to no more than 1 1/4 cups. I thought the addition of coriander was interesting; it added a hint of a lemony note to the flavor. But there again it was nearly overpowered by the sweetness. If you wanted to keep the sugar the same this would probably be the kind of pie that is good cut with a slice of fresh cheddar cheese.",
