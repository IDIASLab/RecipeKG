I did make some adjustments because I didn't have some ingredients. I used honey instead of corn syrup. I used half the butter, and substituted with coconut milk (the canned kind). I accidentally doubled the brown sugar for the crust, no problems. I added coconut (shredded) to the crust bc why pack up what's left in the bag? Throw it in! I also did a gluten free version with coconut flour. The crust of that one I added a whole can of coconut milk to help moisten it. Then let the topping sit on it for a half hour before I baked it. Again, came out great. It seems no way to mess this up.",
