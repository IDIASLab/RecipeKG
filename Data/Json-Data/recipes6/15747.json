I made a few changes though for the ginger snaps - I used Speculaas - b/c that is what we have that is similar here in Holland. Also I couldn't find any pecans so I used walnut ice cream in place of the vanilla - that helped cut down on the cost side too. I'd make this again - it was very good. I did half the recipe - and that came to about 1/2 liter of ice cream in case anyone is wondering. Also I think it would be a good idea to skip the cookies and just put it in a pre-baked cookie pie crust and top it with whipped cream. Excellent!",
