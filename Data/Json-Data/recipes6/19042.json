I do have one bone of curious contention... why is it that nearly all the folks who rate this at a \"one star\" rating pretty much complain that it is 'too spicy' or 'too tangy' or 'too sweet'.. after reading the clear and detailed dish description, then rate it down complaining that it is just as I said it is??  I specifically outlined the tastes so that those who would not be interested in the taste would not bother to make it.  Don't rate me down to ground because it doesn't suit your personal tastes.  Just don't make the dish to begin with.  This is a first-rate recipe!!  And thanks again to all you who continue to lend input and suggestions!  Only makes the recipe better suited to a wider group of folks!!  Bon Appetit!!!",

For those who will be making it again you get a MUCH more tender chicken if you mix the chopped chicken with a bit of soy sauce sherry cornstarch and oil before frying it in the pan. If you just put the chicken in \"naked\" like the recipe says the chicken is tougher. Too tough for my taste. Another tip for those who think it's too strong in the vinegar taste or want more sauce but not more vinegar. It's okay to add half a cup or more of water to this recipe. Just adjust everything to taste. You don't have to keep adding only soy sauce vinegar and sugar to make more sauce.",

I did not add peas mushrooms and did not thicken. We put the chicken on top of green salad and used the sauce as a hot spicy vinagrette dressing. It was awesome. As another reviewer stated it does taste a lot like General Tso's without breading. Will use time and time again. Thanks so much!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I read through the reviews before making this dish. As a result I made numerous modifications to this recipe and it came out absolutely delicious. I made the following changes: (1) I used one fresh yellow onion about six cloves of garlic and about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped up ginger. I'm a big believer in using fresh ingredients where possible and here I think it really adds to the flavor. Before adding the chicken I sauteed the onion garlic and ginger in the oil for about two minutes. (2) In terms of the sauce I used 1/2 cup white vinegar 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce and 1/2 cup brown sugar. (3) In addition to the 8 ounces of mushrooms and one cup of peas I added one chopped green bell pepper and one chopped red bell pepper. I did not include the cornstarch. It gives a great Asian flavor and is much tastier than what you would get in most Chinese restaurants. Plus there is the added advantage that it tastes so much healthier because I was able to use all organic and fresh ingredients. I will definitely make this again maybe rotating different vegetables (I think this recipe would also work with broccoli green beans sugar snap peas bamboo shoots water chestnuts bok choy baby corn a lot of things). I also think it is really important to accompany this dish with rice. My rice really absorbed the sauce well.",

Also added fresh broccoli and snow peapods. Next time I would reduce the amount of vinegar a bit (1 c from 1.5 c) and also the soy sauce (1/4 c from 1/2 c) as it was too salty (or try low sodium soy sauce). It was a pretty good stir-fry but just too salty for my tastes. My friend also made it and used low-sodium soy sauce and said it came out perfect.",
