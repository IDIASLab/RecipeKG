It is even better with the following small tweaks: first instead of water use buttermilk for additional moistness and flavor; stick with Hellman's mayonnaise not a strong-flavored one like Cain's; use Penzey's high fat cocoa powder and Ghirardelli semi sweet mini-chips for the richest chocolate flavor; use a bundt pan greased and floured with cocoa powder instead of a 9 X 13 pan and bake at 350 for 50 minutes. Drizzle chocolate ganache over the top or serve with a dollop of whipped cream. The cake is actually even more moist and flavorful when it is two days old so make it ahead of time!",
