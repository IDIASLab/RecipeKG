(If anyone wants to know the drained weight of 1/2 of a 20-oz. can of Dole pineapple is 5-1/2 oz.) I used fresh (slightly sweetened) strawberries. The pineapple and banana became kind of mushy so next time I will try pineapple tidbits and only coarsely chunk the banana for a better texture. Also I would add the fruits directly to the creamed mixture gently mix this and then gently fold in the whipped topping (one less dirty bowl). DO add some slivered almonds or chopped pecans over the top. YUMMY.",

I thought that because there is a lot of whipped cream in it it shouldn't freeze too hard (whipped cream doesn't freeze solid) but it does. Probably because of all the fruit and the cream cheese it 'bonds' together and makes it very hard. So thaw a bit before serving. Very tasty!",
