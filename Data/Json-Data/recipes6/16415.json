I read the reviews and made some successful adjustments based on some of the issues people had: 1) Too tart 2) \"plastic\" taste/smell and 3) pink/red color inside chicken. 1) & 2) Added some frozen blackberries and raspberries. This added additional sweetness as well as a more fragrant fruity smell. Sometimes unsweetened cranberries can give off a smell that is similar to a \"plastic\" or \"chemically\" smell. Before I added the additional berries I could smell what some people were referring to. After though it smelled great. 3) Make sure to brown the chicken in the oil like the recipe says. This will \"seal\" the outside of the chicken. I had no red/pink color on the inside. I hope this helps. Thanks and enjoy!",
