Don't skip the freezing step we had no problems with the burgers falling apart or flaring up. Good recipe thanks!",

Since I was using ground round and bacon that was precooked I just crunched some of the bacon (which I finished cooking but didn't have enough bacon fat per the recipe) into the beef with the ground pepper and breadcrumbs before forming the burgers being careful not to let any of the bacon bust out from the beef lest it burn. The freezer part is really important--the burgers held together very well on the grill. They were really delicious. I will definitely be making this recipe again--thanks!",
