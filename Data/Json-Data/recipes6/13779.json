I was a little dissapointed about that BUT as i saw more and more people going to my bowl over and over and saying \"whatever this is, it's good!\" i knew the bowl was going to be empty soon. When we cleaned up at the end of the shower , my bowl was in fact empty and the other lady's was almost full. I felt a little bad about that, but hey, if it's better what can you do?

The second time I made this, I wanted to make it less soupy (adding all the juice was just too much liquid), so I drained the entire 20-oz. can of pineapple (chunks) into a measuring cup, then added 1/2 cup juice to the pudding.  Letting it sit overnight is key, as it will taste too much like unprepared pudding if you don't.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and cut down on the amount (used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2), and would do that again.  I also used the entire 8-oz. tub of whipped topping.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I added some cottage cheese to mine for extra texture and calcium.  You really can't taste it, but it was a nice addition.  I've made a recipe similar to this using peach gelatin in place of the pistachio and adding drained sliced peaches.  Ohhh so good!  Will make this again.  Thanks Jennifer.",
