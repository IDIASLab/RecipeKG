I substituted whole wheat flour, olive oil instead of butter, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 tbsp baking powder, 1/4 c brown sugar, and 1 tbsp of vanilla flavoring.  I didn't add the pecans to the batter.  I toasted them and added to warm syrup.  I do think that separating the eggs makes enough of a difference in taste and texture to go through the trouble.  I made them to have with fried chicken and everyone raved about how delicious they were.  The waffled won't get extremely crisp in the waffle iron, but if you toss them in the oven for a couple of minutes they will crisp up just fine.",
