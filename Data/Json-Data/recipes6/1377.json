I also needed to use mini chocolate chips, because the full-sized chips sank to the bottom and made quite a mess when eating.\n\nThe batter as written is extremely thin, so I upped the WW flour to 1-1/4 cups.  It may benefit from even a bit more dry ingredient, so 1/4 cup of ground flax seed would be a nice idea.  With this increased dry amount, the muffins were still very moist.  I used cow's milk, which worked nicely.",

These taste exactly like cupcakes, so that's often what I call them and the kids eat them as fast as I can make them.  I add 1/4 c. oat bran to the dry ingredients because I find the batter to be very thin and the oat bran makes it a little easier to measure out.  I also cut the sugar down as we try to reduce our sugar intake.  Sometimes I use buttermilk instead of milk and it makes them taste a little richer, but otherwise there's no difference.",

Funny story: I forgot the milk and doubled the cocoa in one batch (yes the consistancy was different.....but that is usually the last thing on my radar whilst baking with toddlers....) and they were super delicious and even more fudgy. So now I choose between super yummy muffin super sinful fudgy dessert or beautiful chocolate cupcakes. Thank-you!!:)",

                "reviewBody": "This was a great recipe! I just made a few tweaks: Didn t want to overmix the muffins so waited until the end to add the chocolate chips. I also saw the sugar content was 20 g so I cut the brown sugar and chocolate chips in half. My glasses were dirty after I spilled flour on them so I couldn t read the measure and put in 1/3 cup cocoa powder instead of cup. I didn t have soy milk so I used skim cow s milk. The only applesauce I could find had high fructose corn syrup so I put that aside and substituted nonfat unsweetened yogurt instead. After adding the first egg I realized I had to break it first so fished it out and tried again. I think I got the leavening and salt right. Added cup walnuts at the end to make it a little healthier. Added the oil after they started going into the muffin cups because I forgot it with the wet ingredients (canola oil didn t have grapeseed oil). I got a full dozen 6 mini muffins out of this recipe. I noticed that they came out nice on top but a little gooey on the bottom so I swapped the oven off the broil setting and put them on bake on the bottom shelf for a few more minutes. With the changes the muffins came down to 12 g of sugar and 158 calories each (13 muffins assumed) making them just healthy enough to eat when no one is looking. Meanwhile my family gobbled up the muffins and took away my car keys.",
