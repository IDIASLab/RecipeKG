That spice rack sitting in the corner of your kitchen that you got from Aunt Betty 20 years ago as a wedding gift wasn't given as a show piece. Don't be afraid of those things called spices! They can dress up almost anything and this dish is certainly no exception to that rule. I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, tarragon and thyme for a savory and delicious addition that made these pork chops pop and I only marinaded it for 30 minutes. Imagine what how those chops would taste after sitting in all of that savory goodness overnight!  Try it! Hopefully you'll agree and get creative shaking those pretty jars sitting in the corner of your kitchen taking up counter space!",

I read one review that said these chops had no taste, so I decided that a sweeter mustard might work better. You can see the seeds in the mustard on the photo I took, so maybe a whole grain mustard works best.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  We enjoyed these pork chops.  We rate it a 4 1/2!  I've saved some of the reserved sauce for another recipe--maybe chicken.  Thanks, Laura!  This helped us start in the new year!",

Doubled the sauce for my thick steaks.  Used apple concentrate from the can, undiluted.   The fat marbled in the thick steaks kept them nice and moist.  My father is a pork chop enthusiast and was a bit unsure about grilling something so thick.  Take your time, use a bit lower heat and you will end up with restaurant worthy meat, nicely carmelized and very juicy.  Grill up onions and sweet apples on the side.  Marinade was spot on delicious.  Amazing flavor!  Use good quality Dijon mustard. I do not understand the review about having no flavor, perhaps they used poor mustard and did not marinate overnight...",
