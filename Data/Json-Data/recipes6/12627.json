My icing came out so thick and I think I might have figured out why some are having problems with it being too thin. If you are using margering instead of butter, there is a higher content of water in it.  This frosting is fantastic for cupcakes, nice and thick if you use butter.  I'll be keeping this easy and delicous recipe.",

I made the vanilla version and didn't measure the milk, just added enough to get the consistency I wanted.  For novice cooks, it is important to cream the butter and sugar well, a good few minutes, until it is very light and fluffy!  Update 11-19-12: The chocolate variation of this recipe, while fluffy and delicious, is a very LIGHT chocolate.  If you like it darker, replace some of the powdered sugar with more cocoa powder.",
