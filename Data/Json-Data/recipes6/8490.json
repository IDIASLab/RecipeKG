The dried shrimp is an added flavor and modification I made to the original dish. This recipe is easy to make, and will be a hit at family gatherings. Tastes really good with steamed or spiced rice.",

I would actually cook the meat in the coconut milk mixture for the stated time- it is still moist and tender but it infuses the flavors.  I also added carrots, potatoes, and green peas.  A note on the curry paste- it is usually sold in Asian markets in cans the size of tuna, If you buy this size, half a can will make a pretty spicy dish.  Usually a fourth of a can will impart pleanty of flavor if you like some spice but not too much.  Enjoy!",

My kids don't like it to spicy. I also added 1 T of cumin. I added some extra veggies. 1 jicama chopped 1 green pepper chopped 1 shredded carrot and 1 cup snow peas chopped and 1 cup chopped kale. I always add extra veggies just to get them in for the kids. These added veggies added a lovely color. I found it a bit thick after the veggie addition so i added 1 cup plain yogurt. At the end i also added 1 cup raisins and 1/2 cup sesame seeds Extra crunch and a bit of sweetness from the raisins. Great recipe.",

Cheated massively by not pre-treating the beef (time reasons) just chucked it in and sauteed it with the garlic onions etc. Didn't have dried shrimp so substituted prawn paste which worked well otherwise used ingredients specified - including red chilli pepper.

Still turned out fantastic! Goes great with some roti and basmati rice. But be forewarned, it is very spicy (like curry is supposed to be).",
