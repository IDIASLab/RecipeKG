I have no idea how well this keeps because it disappears as soon as I serve it. Oh the last time I made it I had peaches left over so I diced them and spread them over the batter before I added the topping. Thanks Anne this is a winner!",

That's the Only reason I knocked off 1 star. I was out of brown sugar so I used Piloncillo cones raw sugar instead. ( This is found in the Mexican markets and looks like brown cones hence the name) I added a squirt of maple syrup. I chopped up about 1 tbs of crystallized ginger. There was apples and nectarines in the fridge chopped and tossed those in too. I had no yogurt so I mixed some apple cider vinegar and milk to make buttermilk. This created a nice tang to the cake. I was taking this to school so no nuts you never know. Baked it in a bunt pan and brushed the whole thing with Grand Marne. I mixed up some SF vanilla pudding to top the cake a few sprinkles and the Lunch ladies didn't stand a chance! Nice and spicy. Perfect way to start off the school year! This ROCKS ANNIE!

I only just found your recipe today and it's right up my alley so I wasted no time in getting into the kitchen with it. I remembered too late that I didn't have my small baking pan so made it into muffins instead. It filled 13 cups perfectly and I baked them at the suggested temperature for 25 minutes. I thought I had better halve the crumb topping for the muffins but it's so good I will be sure to make it a cake next time to enjoy fully that wonderful topping. Thanks so much for developing and sharing this recipe. Just be sure and let me know about the next one please!",
