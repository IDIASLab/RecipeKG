                "reviewBody": "I lost my Gran's recipe & was so happy 2 find the same one here! The recipe tastes great as written but over the years I've made a few changes(according to my personal taste)and with a few small adjustments, I prefer it. So, I thought I'd share. Firstly, instead of white sugar, I use 1/2 C packed brown sugar. The molasses in the brown sugar makes this pudding taste richer. The original recipe calls for 3 Tbs cocoa, I heap my Tbs to make it a bit more chocolately. I also find 1/4 C cornstarch was a little too much for me, as the pudding went as firm as jello the next day instead of staying creamy. If u add just over half that amount & cook it slightly longer it gels less. Of course, if you like it that way or are using this recipe to make a chocolate pie or square that you want to keep it's shape when cut, then you'll want to use the full amount. Lastly, I always use evaporated milk when cooking. It just tastes creamier to me. Thanks for posting this recipe, Kelly! Update,July 09: To avoid lumps, put 1st 4 ingredients in saucepan and mix well. If there are any lumps, get in there with your fingers and work them out. If you don't want to do it with your hands you can use a sifter or push them through a sieve. You must have a smooth, lump-free powder before you add your liquid. I also use a whisk and constantly stir. Lastly, it will sometimes thicken before it boils but I find if I don't let it boil for even just 10 seconds, I can taste the cornstarch in it. Thanks :)",

                "reviewBody": "Very very easy pudding. I also used three 'heaping' teaspoons of the cocoa, since I really enjoy a nice deep chocolate flavor. Make sure not to overcook, and never boil or it tends to try and lump up on you, but that can be resolved with a brisk whisking as the mixture starts to cool. Another tip is when you put it in the fridge to cool completly, try to make sure you have brought it down to about lukewarm temperature outside the fridge, I whisk away at it while having the sink filled about an inch or two deep with cold water and some ice cubes, really cuts down on the wait time for that. AND when you finally do put it in the fridge, use some plastic wrap to cover but make sure the plastic is lying directly on top of the pudding, actually touching it all the way over the top. This seems to prevent that top layer of strange congealed pudding you sometimes get when the pudding sits for awhile,which taste fine, but is a bit odd compared to the creamy pudding underneath it.",

Mine JUST started boiling, but it stuck to the spoon and because I was worried about it burning, I removed it from the heat.  I think had I let it boil for just moments longer it would have been thicker.  FYI, I used skim milk.  I thought it had a very rich flavor and definitely took care of my pregnant chocolate craving. :)",

Found this one and made it as the ingredient list is  the same, just different proportions.  It is very, very good.  I baked a pie crust and poured the warm pudding into it; am waiting for it to chill.  But, as I doubled the recipe there was a good bit leftover and son and I have tried it.  This is almost exactly the flavor of the recipe I've lost! I'm so happy and son is too! Chocolate pudding pie is a three-generation family favorite for us, so I am really picky about how I make it. This recipe is smooth, creamy, not too sweet when made properly. Be sure to cook over MEDIUM heat and don't get in a hurry after it boils, give it a few more minutes.  Put plastic wrap on it to avoid the \"skin.\"",

Also, after cooling a bit, place plastic wrap right down over the top of the pudding and this prevents the rubbery film from forming.  DO NOT REDUCE THE CORNSTARCH MEASUREMENT.If it's too think you're over cooking it, if it's too thin...you're under cooking. I've found this recipe to be virtually fool proof. ENJOY!!",

I used to stir the milk the whole time, and it would take FOREVER to boil and the milk would sometimes get a burnt flavor because it was on the heat for so long.  Only stir occasionally until it starts to boil (otherwise it keeps losing the heat and won't get hot enough to boil), and then stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes before taking it off the heat.  If you do that, then it is easy and relatively fast to make pudding.",
