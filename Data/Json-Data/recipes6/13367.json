I lessened the sugar to 2/3 a cup and it tastes great!\n\nSome words to the wise:  Cook sugar/half&half mixture on medium to medium high, but don't let it burn and don't stop stirring!  For those of you who couldn't get it to turn, keep stirring and be patient, as it takes a little time to happen, but when it does, it's magic!  \n\nAnd when they say \"Watch Carefully when it's under Broiler\", they mean it!  It could take as little as twenty or thirty seconds to bubble.  (I left mine in for one minute and it burned the butter covering so I had to fix it.)",

So, while I'm reading the reviews, preparing to make this for our New Years Day dinner, I saw that someone mentioned wanting to try adding bananas next time....and yet another person mentioned drizzling with chocolate syrup and it would taste like an eclair!  So I thought to myself, \"Hey!  Why not add BOTH banana AND chocolate syrup and end up with a sundae pie!\"  Right?  So I send my poor hubby to the store for a banana, since now I don't have all the ingredients!  He was hijacked or something at the local market and ended up taking an HOUR to get back with the banana!  In the meantime, I had started cooking this mixture and it (very suddenly!) became the right consistency!  Shoot!  Still no banana!  Poured it into the GRAHAM crust and remembered that I hadn't added the vanilla!  (\"Where's that BANANA?\", I'm thinking!)  So while I was waiting (argh!) I put the vanilla into a little kitchen spray bottle that I have and gently misted the top of the pie!  (by this time you're probably thinking I have never cooked a thing in my life, right?)  LOL  When he (finally) got home, I sliced the banana (resisted rapping him up-side the head with it!) and arranged slices on top of the vanilla misted pie!  Dab of whipped cream, drizzle of syrup and a cherry on top.  Even after ALL of this, the pie was AWESOME!  So I gave 5 stars because I KNOW that if it wasn't for this recipe, it COULD NOT have been possible!  Note to self:  Make hubby take kids along next time!  :)",

Substitute flour for the cornstarch-it will thicken up no matter how long you stir it-and let it boil and thicken up on the burner (while you stir it) until it thickens and is creamy. Grandma never used the cinnamon or the vanilla (it evaporates anyways) and she used 2 1/2 cups of cream or evaporated milk. Bake at 325 for about 30 minutes on a cookie sheet and be careful to watch it the last five minutes so it doesn't start boiling over and ruining the pie. Once it starts to boil, take it out, it's done. Cool completely before cutting and enjoy!",

I used the ingredients listed, except I used brown sugar in place of the cinnamon on the top.  I cooked the filling on medium until it began to bubble throughout and it thickened up to the consistency of pie filling (thicker than pudding), about 15 minutes total.  I poured it into the baked pie shell, scattered tiny pats/shavings of butter across and then spread a thin layer of brown sugar across the entire top.  I baked it for 25 minutes @ 325 like another reviewer suggested, then I placed a pie shield over the crust and put it under the broiler on the 2nd rack from the top (DO NOT use the top rack!! I learned the hard way that this pie scorches in SECONDS).  It only takes 20-60 seconds to brown the top so it's bubbly and browned, yet not burned. Definitely keep an eye on it while it's broiling and be sure to cover the crust to prevent burning.  You could skip the broiling altogether, but I wanted the brown sugar to caramelize and give a crunchiness.  Once it was sizzling all across the top I took it out, & once cool enough I covered & refrigerated to take to a dinner the next day.  It was served @ room temp and when sliced held its shape perfectly.  It tasted somewhat custard-like, minus the egginess, & had a rich vanilla cream taste, like a firm vanilla pudding.  I'll make this again for sure, sometimes just as a pudding, the filling is SO tasty warm.",
