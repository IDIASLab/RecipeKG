I had to cook my ham in a roaster, so to start off I dumped 2 16oz bottles of Verners ginger ale in the bottom of the roaster. I made up my mixture, placed the ham inside & then basted it with the mixture. I then tooth picked 1 can of pineapple rings to the ham & basted it more. I cooked this ham at 275 for 45, basted the ham with whatever mixture I had left. Then cooked it for 45 more min at 350.  Turned out Great!!! I can't wait to cook a whole bone in ham again!",
