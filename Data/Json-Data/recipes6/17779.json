PARCHMENT PAPER\nbuy it, use it, you will have no more problems and you will never go back.   Since some people said this didn't have enough flavor, I compared it with other recipes.  Due to this I used 2 tsp of vanilla, 1.5 tsp of salt, and of course, who would use margarine when you could use butter.  Beat the heck out of the sugars and butter and oil and eggs so it is almost like cake batter.  The dough is very soft so a quick chill in the fridge makes it easy to work with.  Very well liked, have had someone ask for the recipe where ever I take them. Thanks Mary Ann-Permanantly in my cookie recipe box. ",

Here are the things that I did to make the most of these pecan sandies: (1) For the sugar, I kept the confectioner's sugar the same but for the cup of white, instead I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar; (2) Instead of using 1 cup oil and 1 cup margarine, I used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 cup butter; (3) I doubled the vanilla extract; (4) I added one dash of cinnamon (who knows if this actually added anything to the flavor); (5) I did freeze the dough for a half an hour before trying to roll it because it is gooey; (6) I did use parchment paper on the ungreased cookie sheet as other reviewers have recommended; (7) Once rolled into balls, the way I flattened the cookies was by pushing a half a pecan into the center (they don't spread much in the cooking); (8) Instead of rolling the dough balls in extra sugar, I cooked them without and then once cooked and cooled for a bit, I took a queue from another reviewer and brushed a maple glaze on the cookie.  The maple glaze recipe I used was to mix together the following ingredients: (a) 1 and 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar; (b) 1 tsp. vanilla extract; (c) 1/2 cup pure maple syrup.  Once I made these changes, these cookies blew my mind.  So delicious and different from a typical cookie.  Thanks so much for the recipe and for all the comments from reviewers. ",

Mine didn't spread out at all and stayed in pretty much a ball shape; it was probably because of the butter. They're cute though! The dough was very wet right until I added the pecans. It was too squishy to \"roll\" in sugar so I sprinkled it on with a spoon (on some of them) and stuck whole pecans on top of the rest of them. I cut the recipe in half and used half brown sugar for the white. I also used half whole-wheat pastry flour. Baked for only 8-9 minutes. I used unsalted butter and put in less salt than the recipe states; I could still taste the salt a little too much. So if you use salted butter you may want to cut way down on the extra salt.",
