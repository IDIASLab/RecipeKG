I made these using all WHITE whole wheat flour& 2T \"vital wheat gluten\". I have found from many years of baking w/ww flour that almost any yeast bread recipe that uses egg (i.e. challah rolls etc.) will convert cup for cup from white to wheat & still be light/fluffy others may need tweaking or the addition of some white flour. The dough was still quite wet so I added a more flour (1/4c). I used smart balance oil instead of butter in both parts of the recipe (butter was frozen didn't feel it was worth the trouble for such a smll amt). I didn't worry about this in the bread part since I always use oil in lieu of butter in my yeast breads but was concerned if it would affect taste for the dipping part it didn't (only need 2-3T oil for dipping). I used 2T honey for the sugar in the bread part of the recipe (something else I always do dealing w/whole wheat breads; the honey/oil combo keep my wheat breads nice and moist) but I still used (BRWN)sugar for dipping (doubled this amt to 6T; the 1st time I made this 3 wasn't enough). Made the pieces smaller this time (35-40 instead of 20) because w/my whole wheat monkey bread I find it this gives each bite flavor or else some bites just taste like bread. I let it rise on the counter for 35min then covered put in fridge until am. Only took about 20-22 min so watch your time.",

It was such a MESS and has to be the stickiest dough I have ever worked with. I had no choice but to add a little flour to get it to hold ANY shape. I added some flour and worked it in just trying to salvage it. As another reviewer stated there was too much butter and not enough sugar to roll the balls in. You probably need about half the amount of butter and twice the amount of sugar. And lastly there was not enough orange juice listed for the glaze. After mixing the powdered sugar and the orange juice it was still powder-y. The presentation was very pretty. It had a litte hint of orange but not enough sweetness. The texture was off but I'm sure that had something to do with me having to add flour after the dough cycle. I think the concept is a great one but this recipe needs a lot of tweaking! I was really hopeful having orange trees and wanting ways to use the bounty.",
