I read over some of the recommendations, and this is what I did to make this recipe even better. I replaced the water with Pepsi, added about a tsp of liquid smoke, and seasoned the ribs with a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and brown sugar. Added the onion and garlic as stated in the recipe, and cooked them on high for just under 4 hours and followed the rest of the directions. With these changes, I love the recipe even more (though as many people have stated, it's pretty excellent as written)! I know that many people love them to 'fall off the bone', but good ribs should still have a nice bite and pull when you bite into them. Adjust the cooking time accordingly, but for my slow cooker, they are cooked perfectly between 3.5 and 4 hours. Thanks again for all the feedback!! ~Norah",

These were amazing! First time, I made it exactly as the recipe called for and these ribs were fall off the bone good.  The second time, I added smoked paprika and garlic powder to the rub on the ribs before I put them in the slow cooker.  I also used 1/2 cup of beer instead of the water (any liquid will add flavour).  I cooked them on high in the slow cooker for 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I covered a 9 x 11 baking dish with tin foil (to help with clean up) and put the ribs in the uncovered baking dish.  I coated the ribs with bbq sauce and put them in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes.  I pulled the ribs out and added another thin layer of bbq sauce before putting them back in the oven under the broiler for 7 to 10 minutes to get that crust on the top.  The ribs were perfect.  My family thanks you for this recipe which I will be using again and again!  Amanda",

Hubs and I do far too much rib eating in our travels and one thing we've learned from the experts is that, contrary to popular belief, you don't WANT your ribs to fall off the bone.  If that's the state they end up in they've been cooked too long (or stewed).  We like our ribs tender, yet with the meat still clinging to the bone.  I cooked them just short of 4 hours on high, and if I do this again I'd shorten that by an hour.  The finish in the oven, however, was just right - 15 minutes at 375 degrees resulted in a sticky, caramelized,  glazed exterior.  I didn't bother with either the onion or garlic, but I did season them with a good rub seasoning a few hours before I started them in the Crock Pot.  The bottom line?  In spite of not being smoked or grilled, and in spite of too long a stint in the Crock Pot, these were some \"D\" fine ribs.",
