I used canned corn (drained), I used canned green chiles (hot!) :0), I used heavy cream, I used pre-packaged real crumbled bacon bits.  In spite of my substitutions, it turned out fantastic!

I also had to cook the meat much longer than in the instructions like by 25 minutes to get meat browned and water absorbed. I used canned (2 small cans) chopped green chili s strained and pressed to remove water. Added red pepper flakes and used half the corn and added the other half as baby Lima beans. Was delicious!!",
