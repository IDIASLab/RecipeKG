I used dried black eyed peas but followed directions on bag of peas with regards to soaking them by boiling and letting them sit. I always add time to soaking. I drained washed the peas and picked through the soaked peas. This is an important process and step to do. I followed the directions except will add Kale upon reheating the soup today instead of cooking with spinach and used dried parsley (a smaller amount few shakes from container of parsley)In addition added 2 cups more vegetable broth. While simmering for 2 hrs I put lid on Dutch oven. My daughter is a semi vegatarian so wanted to begin a new tradition with the luck of black eyed peas to accommodate her on New Years 2016!

When putting all the ingredients in the pot at once, the result is slightly crunchy beans, dessicated and slimy spinach, mushy zucchini leaving the potatoes and carrots as the only properly cooked vegetables. I would revise this recipe to begin with adding the beans until they are just beginning to soften, followed by the potatoes and carrots. When the potatoes and carrots are beginning to soften, I would then add the zucchini and then the spinach last. This way all the ingredient have a similar texture upon completion!",
