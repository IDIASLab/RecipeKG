Some reviewers found the filling too runny so I thawed and drained the berries first, and also added 2 T of cornstarch to the sugar/flour mix (and increased the sugar to 1 cup per other reviewers).  The pie was not runny at all.  After it cooled, I could slice it into neat wedges without the filling spilling out the edges.  The pie was a little on the skimpy side--I'd use more berries than the recipe calls for if using frozen berries.  Also, don't be afraid to adjust the ratio of the two berries; I used equal parts of both berries and it wasn't too tart.  The crust wasn't bad but it wasn't terrific.  If you already have a good crust recipe, I'd stick with it.",

The juice took over and separated them before I could finish my decorative crust. NOTE! I also added 3 TBS of corn starch.
