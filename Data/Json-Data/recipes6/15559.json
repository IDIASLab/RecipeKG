I also added one more cup of Whiskey to this as the added pineapple jusce will make it want to freeze harder. You want to be able to scoop it out and only add a little ginger ale or lemon lime carbonated type beverage. I keep it in the freezer all summer and use it when ever I want a nice cold punch like drink. If you do not add the tea it will not taste the same so don't forget the tea. I steep 6 tea bags in two cups of very hot water. This makes a good and strong tea.",

I have swiched it up once in a while with different juices. I always use the lemonade but experiment with different juice. My favorite is Cranberry juice with orange spice tea and I use vodka instead of whiskey. During the holidays I try and find cranberry ginger ale instead of lemon-lime soda or you could use a sour soda like 50-50 or squirt. In the summer I have also used a citrus punch juice and a citrus vodka. There are soooo many possibilities with this recipe!! Have fun and enjoy!!!",
