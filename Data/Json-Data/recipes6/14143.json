I made it with an oreo crust otherwise made it as directed except - I didn't have heavy whipping cream - I just used cool whip - and it turned out perfectly....I added slivered almonds to the top - My dad loved it (birthday \"cake\") and I did not think the amaretto was overwhelming at all. I do want to note tho - it says 1 (5oz) can evaporated milk - I ALMOST didn't catch that - the cans I buy are 12 oz - I was pouring a little in at a time and then noticed - so I think I got about 6 oz in - so that may be why some people's didn't set up correctly.... I'm going to try this recipe later this week using pumpkin for thanksgiving....",
