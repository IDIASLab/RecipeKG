I find cooking cauliflower or broccoli rice at low temps causes it to be mushy, so after cooking the onion and garlic on medium-low, I cranked up the heat to medium-high to stir-fry it for 3-4 minutes. That helps it get done quickly (the small pieces don't need a long cook time) without overcooking and keeping some texture to it. Once the broccoli starts turning a muted green color, that's when you know it's starting to overcook.",
