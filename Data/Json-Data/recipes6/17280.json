They're sweet, but you don't lose the dill flavor either, a really good balance of sweet-dill.  Don't add any vinegar to this because you don't need it.  Just drain the pickles, add the seasonings as listed, give this a day in the fridge shaking/turning upside down occasionally, and you'll have delicious juice in the pickle jar...patience will pay off!  You can't buy a jar of pickles that tastes like this, and it just doesn't get much easier to mix up a batch.  Going into my Favorites Collection.",

I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the results. Some of the sugar is still dissolving at the moment but I gave it a little taste test before I stashed them in the fridge and they already tasted great before they were even cold or fully complete. Very good and I will surely be making these again. Thank you so much for a great new recipe.",
