The cookies are easy to make and are delicious! Spelt flour is now available in many grocery stores and all health food stores. Try adding sunflower seeds, almonds, shredded coconut, or oats to the batter for something different!",

The first batch I did I forgot to put the cookies on the lower rack for the first 5 min and cooked them the entire 10 min on the upper rack and they came out ok (but very dry as I already mentioned). For the second batch I did what the recipe said and cooked them on the lower rack the first 5 min and then on the upper rack for the last 5 min and they ended up burnt on the bottoms. I would suggest making sandwich cookies with these and filling the middle with fig jam or mashed dates to add a bit of wet to them. Also if I were to redo them I would only cook them on the upper rack for 8 min to keep them a bit more moist.",

They are a tad on the dry side but if you like a chewier cookie try reducing both the time and the temp. I did do 4 min on the bottom rack and 4 on the top and they had a crunch that was nice. They taste pretty awesome. I ate 4 tiny cookies and had to force myself to put them away. I will make these again. Didn't miss regular flour at all:)",

I made these changes because I have a ridiculously tiny oven (pretty much a European apartment standard) that runs hot and the higher shelf is practically touching the top.
