Start with ROOM TEMPERATURE butter,(REAL butter) cream cheese and eggs which makes for easier mixing and a more creamy outcome, and using cake flour (cup for cup) gives it a more velvet type texture.  I also add the eggs one at a time and make sure each one is completely mixed in before adding the next. And the baking time really depends on how true your oven temp is. Sometimes it may take two hours for this cake to bake if your oven is lower than 325, but baking at a higher temp will cook the outside, but not the in. Tricky?  Yes.  Worth the effort?  Oh yes! Be patient with the mixing, and you will have the best pound cake you will ever eat.  It stands alone, or you can top it with whatever you want.  Simply the best for a good old fashion comfort dessert.",

In fact, one woman almost cried when she took her first bite- she said it tasted just like her mother's pound cake from decades ago! \n\nThe only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and add some almond extract along with the vanilla. \n\nAlso, just a note, but swan's down cake flour is the only flour that I will use for pound cakes. It gives the cake a very fine crumb without the need to sift. \n\nOne more comment: to those people who have uncooked dough in their finished cakes, make sure that your butter and cream cheese are both at true room temperature. Otherwise, the cream cheese doesn't get mixed in and never bakes up, no matter how long you leave it in the oven. \nIf your crust burned before the cake was completely cooked, either the oven was too hot, or your oven doesn't circulate the hot air (convection oven). Use a thermometer to tell what the exact temperature of your oven is, and rotate the cake every 20-25 minutes if it's an older oven.",

This could probably be the best pound cake I have ever made...but I did tweak it a bit.  I used 1-1/4 cups of butter and 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  Buttermilk is a secret ingredient of mine that I like to use in place of regular milk called for in a recipe.  It makes your cakes, muffins and breads very moist.  This recipe didn't call for any liquid, but I did add a little for that \"moistness\".  I also added a tsp of lemon extract to the batter along with the vanilla.  The lemon flavor was very light, but gave it a little something special.  Perfect recipe!!  Many thanks Nanci.",

I've found that good pound cakes aren't hard to make, but they require some care in making them. You can't rush the mixing process. (If you have one, use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment for the best result.) Beat the butter and the cream cheese until it looks silky. Add sugar in a slow stream with the mixer still running and beat until this is full and fluffy. This takes a good while, but this how you'll get a lighter cake. The butter, cheese, sugar and eggs mixture should be well mixed because once you add the flour, you are only mixing to incorporate. Beating the flour in will result in a mess. I followed someone else's suggestion and exchanged 1/4 cup of butter for buttermilk. I baked in a cold oven, the way I always make a pound cake, and had a nice crusty exterior.",

To freshen things up a little bit, I filled the loaf pan about a third way up, and sprinkled some raspberries. Then I topped more batter to completely cover the raspberries.

I also made a yummy glaze out of 2/3 cup of melted margarine, 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, and 1.5tsp of lemon extract. This is a slightly crispy glaze when it sets, and the margarine has just the right amount of salt to offset the sweetness of the cake.",

I looked for many years until I found this one in a church cookbook which he believes is \"just like Mom's\".  In our family cookbook it was voted \"The Best Ever Pound Cake\".  Others might be interested in an alteration I've made when adding nuts to this cake.  Reduce the flour to 2 cups and add one cup of pecans by hand at the end.  For several years I've reduced the sugar to 2 cups and haven't missed it.  But if you like chocolate chips or icing on your pound cake then you'll most likely want to keep 3 cups of sugar in the recipe.  I also start baking in a cold oven, my grandmother said it made the crust true.  I'm not sure if there is any truth to this or just an old wives tale, but the cake turns out great!  A definite family favorite.",
