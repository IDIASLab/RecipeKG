I am proud to tell you that I was able to convert this to a bread machine recipe (okay, if that isn't truly a big deal, please don't burst my bubble, my nickname in high school was blonde roots).  I put the water, milk, sugar and melted butter in the machine first, then stirred in the yeast and let it all sit for 5 minutes.  I then piled the rest in as directed BUT I DID increase salt to a teaspoon and I DECREASED THE FLOUR to 3 1/3 cups.  I set the machine on the dough cycle and let it go!  When it was done, I put the dough in an oiled bowl and let it kinda rise again.  I followed the recipe the rest of the way as written.  It does taste a LOT like Pita and it is soooo good!!   THANK YOU!!!!  ***Added 7/3/2007, this recipe has been a family favorite. This is one bread that my kids actually bargain with me to make:). The ONLY thing I do different is I use my Wolfgang Puck Bistro Grill and fry this bread in a bigger batch. Thanks for giving my family something to reminisce about:).",
