I expected that the chicken might burn so I tossed the chicken with the sauce and then returned to the Instant Pot but with a trivet between the chicken and bottom of the pot. Unfortunately this did not stop it from burning and I ended up finishing the chicken up in the oven. Not sure how to prevent burning, but I would try doubling the sauce next time to see if this helps. Instant Pots are tricky like that!",

I proceeded to remove the mixture and scrub out the inner pot I then added more chicken stock stir in mixture and proceeded to pressure cook. This finally worked but broccoli ended up overlooked and the overall dish had a burnt flavor chalked up as an epic fail. I have since leaned for pressure cook setting to work there needs to be at least 1.5 cups of liquid in inner pot may attempt again as soon as I can figure out the right consistency for the sauce to be liquid enough for pressure cook setting and still turn out thicker in the end.",
