                "reviewBody": "Here are some things to know about meringue that will help you if you are unclear about some of the directions in this recipe.   1) Make sure you have completely seperated the yolk from the white... the slightest bit of yolk will break down you whites.   2) Make you your mixing bowl is 100% GREASE FREE!!!  Very important! 3) Keep your eggwhites at ROOM TEMP before you beat. 4) Begin beating the egg whites slowly, increasing speed when they are frothy and beating until soft peaks just begin to form. Continue beating, slowly adding the sugar and then the cornstarch mixture. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, this takes a little time. Egg whites are \"STIFF\" when the beaters leave ridges in the whites and they are glossy and hold a stiff peak when the beaters are lifted out. 5) It is VERY important to beat your eggwhites completely and not stop until you are ready to put on the pie.  Meringue starts to deflate within 5 minutes of turning off the mixer.  Hope this helps!!",

One word:  Awesome!  \n\nFor others, like myself, who are \"dummies\" at meringue making, I want to point out a few things about this recipe.  \n\nFirst of all, it is super easy to make!  \n\nThe cornstarch mixutre (preparation), can be tricky!  My mixture never did turn clear.  I followed the directions to a T.  After about 10 minutes, I gave up, and simply removed it from the heat, as directed.  I did cook it on low, and although it never did get clear, it worked, beautifully!  I would suggest this:  Cook it on low, as directed, and if it never does go clear, remove it from the heat, after about 5 minutes.  \n\nThe recipe did not state what speed to put the beater on.  I would suggest hi.  As far as how long to actually beat the egg white mixture, that is tricky, too.  NOT being familiar with meringue, I beat it on hi for ten minutes!  It said to beat, until \"stiff.\"  One persons definition of stiff, may not be the same as someone elses!  So, with that said, I would recommend beating it, maybe, 5 or 6 minutes.  \n\nThis made a delectible meringue!  It was super easy to fix, and more than covered my pie! It peaked, beautifully, just as it should, and I took a picture of it!! \n\nI put it in the oven on 350 for 17 minutes, exactly!    \n\nMeringue II, as the recipe is called, just doesn't get it!  This recipe deserves a much better name, and an award!\n\nTry it, you'll love it!\n\nlamborghinigal@bellsouth.net",
