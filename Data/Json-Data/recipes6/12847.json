Next I will increase the Maple extract to 1 tbsp increase the white sugar to 2 cups instead of 1 cup. If you want the cookies crisp place your cookie sheet on the bottom rack with no foil underneath. I also think that using a hand mixer for this recipe is unnecessary. Perhaps that is where I went wrong? In any case it's not a bad recipe but it needs tweaking. There just very little flavor and it wasnt sweet for a dessert cookie.",
