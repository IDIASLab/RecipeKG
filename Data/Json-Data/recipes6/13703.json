I quess my only (very small) complaint about this bread was that I wanted more cranberries. I would probably double the amount next time. Thank you Karin for submitting this recipe!\n\np.s. I made another batch and baked it as mini loaves... recipe made 4; they were done in 25 min.... love this recipe!",

Other than doubling the amount to 2 cups of berries and keeping them whole, I don't change a thing.  Don't overbake. 50 min. exactly is right.  If the dough is too stiff, add a few tablespoon of milk to moisten it up. TIP - for a prettier bread, place some cranberries on top of the batter before you bake it.  The red color on top adds a gorgeous appearance to the bread. I also glaze mine with a lemon glaze. The glaze gives it a little tart flavor on top and keeps the bread moist. (glaze - lemon juice and powdered sugar).  Glaze while warm.",
