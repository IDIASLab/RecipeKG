When I took the first sip during the meal I could not believe how sweet it was! Thinking the measurements were off I asked him if he followed the recipe. Of course he said no! However my guests ALL loved it. For me it was an easy fix by adding more cold water. There was NOT a drop left and they wanted more! Update I have made this several times and like how you can adjust to your taste (water and sugar). The only downfall is the time it takes to get the seeds out of each slice. I always cut back on the sugar by half. I will continue to make this recipe because there is nothing like fresh lemonade!",
