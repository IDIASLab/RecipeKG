I increased the recipe because I needed more servings. I saut\u00e9ed an onion in olive oil and added some cumin in my soup pot before adding the mashed beans mixture. After the soup was done I used an immersion blender to blend the soup up just a bit (not too much because I didn't want super creamy soup). I also added some spicy organic chipotle chicken sausage (that I grilled ahead of time) to the soup along with the cilantro cheddar cheese and sour cream toppings! My Hubby loved it!",
