Beautiful moist ,mahogany wings that are finger licking good,",

Instead of using chicken wings I grilled some chicken breasts then sliced them up into cubes coated them with the sauce then served it over jasmine rice carrots and broccoli. This dish came out amazing. I do recommend really listening to the recipe when it comes to low sodium soy sauce. All I had in my pantry was regular soy sauce and after using that it was way to salty so I ended up having to add more sugar and BBQ sauce to offset some of that saltiness after cooking it down an extra 5 minutes it was perfect! I will definitely be making this again!",
