For my cheddar I used applewood smoked cheddar inside and on top, and the flavor it added was amazing. I highly recommend using a smoked cheese with it. After baking I broiled the enchiladas for a couple of minutes to lightly brown the top. So yummy, and very easy to prep. Served with spanish rice and paired it with \"A big honkin' margarita\" from this site. great mexican dinner night!! Can't wait to make these again. Thanks bean machine!",
