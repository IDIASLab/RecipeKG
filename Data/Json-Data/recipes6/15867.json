Ten ounces of rum in the glaze and a 1/4 cup in the mix is almost a whole pint. Be careful and remember that this cake is supposed to serve 14. I've read that some cooks had a problem with the glaze; it's almost like making candy to make this glaze you need to boil down the ingredients...the mixture will bubble furiously and it needs to for several minutes before it will set as a candied glaze (not the easiest for an inexperienced cook). If you need practice on glazing read up; preparing the glaze correctly will help so this cake won't become a soggy mess...(as some reviewers have stated) It is most awesome and deserves to be made correctly and served at every winter holiday!",

When it was time to add the glaze I inserted a teeny funnel in the holes and put about 1/4 cup at a time in. It took a few minutes longer but was well worth the wait. This is NOT for your kid's birthday party! Thank you for a great holiday recipe. I made this a second time this week and it was fabulous! This time I let it sit about 20 hours prior to serving. The texture was wonderful and it held it's shape well. The flavor was out of this world - sweet and spicy flavor was perfect. I used spiced rum this time. To make this work you really need to put some care and time into it. If you do you'll be glad you did!",

For a healthier version... substitute the 1/2 cup of vegetalbe oil for 1 cup mashed over-ripe bananas OR 3/4 cup apple sauce OR a little more than 1/2 cup plain or vanilla yogurt.

Although I do like the taste of rum I could not even make myself eat a single bite because the smell of the alcohol was SO strong. With all the good reviews though I may have just done something wrong. I had to throw out the whole cake though because nobody in the house would even try it and I won't try it again just in case this is what it's supposed to be like.",
