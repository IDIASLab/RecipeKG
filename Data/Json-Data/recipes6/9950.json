I never buy self rising flour so I just add 1.5 tsp. of baking powder to 1 cup of flour & voila self rising flour hack.  Generously coat a baking sheet with organic olive oil & a dusting of flour before spreading out crust.  Par bake at 450 for 7 minutes.  Take out & top with ingredients & pop back into oven at 500 degrees for 10 minutes.

I doubled the recipe so I could use my large pizza pan.  It was humid the day I made it, so I did have to add extra flour.  I put it in my KA and let the dough hook do all the work.  I ended up with too much dough, so I roll it out and made 6 bread sticks with the leftovers.  The crust came out nice and crisp and worked great!  I par-baked the crust at 450\u00b0 for 5 minutes before adding 11 toppings.  The crust held up great and had wonderful flavor.  I most definitely will be using this crust again.",

Used this recipe for a taco pizza I  pre-baked for about 5min, at the suggestion of another review. used a pizza stone for one pizza and a cookie sheet with parchment for the other. Both came out crispy on bottom, sightly chewy on top. Husband (who is persnickety) said it was really good! my 4 year old thought it too crispy on bottom; my 9yr old, who I might mention has a dental appliance, was able to chew with no difficulty. Who knew all this time that homemade pizza dough was a couple cups of flour and some Greek yogurt away?...especially in a pinch! Keeping this \"golden nugget\" for future use. Thanks!",
