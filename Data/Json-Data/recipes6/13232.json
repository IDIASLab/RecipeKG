I added a couple dashes of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg and followed the suggestion to use cornstarch to thicken the filling-(Dissolve the cornstarch in small amount of water then add to filling while on stove)My cantaloupe was very ripe(had dents on the skin) so I suggest you use a little less sugar if your's is also and less sugar on the merengue as well. Let the filling thicken on stove considerably before you place in the baked pie crust. After the pie cooled I refridgerated it then served it chilled.",
