Added walnuts just because my family likes them and only made some minor changes (only because I wanted to use what I had on hand) - topped up the pumpkin with some unsweetened applesauce as I didn't have enough pumpkin used whipping cream - because I wanted to use it up. These get most of their sweetness from the chocolate chips. My two year old gobbled these up. Will definitely make again.",
