When I went vegetarian I came up with this Skyline lentil chili to give me that Skyline taste. I use green or black lentils as the protein where standard Cincinnati-style would use ground meat. Even though I've gone back to eating meat this is still my preferred way to get my Skyline fix.",

I served it as written in the description with onions, kidney beans, and cheese then served it over spaghetti. I should have broken the spaghetti into pieces. Serving over long spaghetti seemed more like a rag\u00f9 than a chili. Regardless, it was absolutely delicious. Thank you for the recipe.",
