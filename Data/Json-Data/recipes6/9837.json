I had never made a volcano cake and had to Google a similar recipe to find out when to add the chocolate glaze. The recipe does not state whether to glaze the cake while it is still hot or wait until it is cooled. Even though I liked the peanut butter/cream cheese filling I thought the cake itself was on the dry side even after it was glazed.",
