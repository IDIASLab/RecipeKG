                "reviewBody": "I used Fuji apples that were short on shelf life.  They were a little smaller so I think ended up with approx. 18 apples. Since Fuji's are sweet, I only added 1 1/4 C. brown sugar. Cooked on HIGH for 5-6 hours and let cool slightly. Threw them in the food processor and VIOLA! I got 6.5 pints and it's wonderful! Thick and sweet. It looks as good as it tastes. This will be \"THE\" apple butter recipe from now on.\n\n**UPDATE** Made it again this week (10/31/2019) with a mix of small Fuji apples and a few Honeycrisp. Again, they were just a hair past ripe and since they are both sweet apples, I cut down on the brown sugar to 1.5 cups. They also made an incredible amount of their own juice. When tender in the crockpot, I put on the stove and used an immersion blender and then cooked a little of the juice off. I will do this every time as it really bloomed all of the flavors. Hands down, still my favorite apple butter recipe.",

I cut down on the sugar, only because my apples didn't require it.  I started with 3 cups of dark brown sugar and added another 1/4 cup about 3 hours before it was done. ( Recall I doubled my batch-for one batch I would start with 1.5 cups of sugar and add according to taste) I canned about 5-8 oz and 2 half quart jars. I can give some of the smaller ones for gifts.  Thanks for my new go-to Apple Butter recipe!",
