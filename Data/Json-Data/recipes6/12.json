Warning - put a sign by this saying \"Savory......\" Some people thought it was a sweet cheese cake with carmel drizzle. OPPS - Sorry! This can be made ahead of time and refrigerated or even frozen. I said it serves 24 but it actually would probably serve more than that. I plan to make one and freeze in smaller pieces for a elegant appetizer to take to holiday parties. Update- I used my immersion hand blender to mash up the onion fruit mixture - if you don't have one I would consider peeling the pears. Also as you are adding the eggs to the filling - do so on a slow speed and try to not incorporate too much air. Air in the filling causes the cheesecake to crack.",

I am sorry, but I have wanted to make this for a very long time and I didn't have any event large enough to do this generous and beautiful appetizer. I decided that I would divide this to serve 6 so that I might use it for just my husband & I for Valentines Day as an app. and freeze some for drop in guests. Please forgive me Nana for deconstructing this to use in small amounts. First, I skipped the crust recipe because I decided to bake this  4 oz ramekins. To compensate for the thyme that was missing in the crust, I added it to the cheese mixture. I divided the finished cheesecake mixture between three 4 oz ramekins and baked in a water bath at 350 for 30 minutes. They puffed up beautifully. I then halved the fruit compote recipe and made as directed. I did not \"frost\" the cheesecakes cuz they came out beautifully. I then served the compote over the cheesecake with a sprinkle of toasted pecans and sliced baguettes for the foundation. YUMMY!!!! The beauty is that I still have two little ramekins in the freezer to pull out when I have impromptu guests or just us :) Thanks so much for sharing Baking Nana. this is impressive and delicious!",
