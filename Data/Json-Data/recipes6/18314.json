I have a couple of suggestions for achieving corn dog perfection:  1)  Dry the hot dogs with a paper towel before dipping them in the batter.  This way, you don't need to coat them with flour or anything before dipping.  2)  Make sure your batter is ICE COLD.  This will make it thicker and it will resist \"melting\" off into the oil before it firms up from frying.  3)  Use regular Farmer John hot dogs...not the all-beef kind (that's what the carnival food wagons all use!).  4) Omit the black pepper from this recipe.  It's not needed.",

I precooked the hotdogs first in boiling water for 7 min.  I then let the mixture and the hotdogs rest for 10 min.  I coated them with corn starch and the mixture stuck very well.  Also, make sure your oil is the perfect temp.  365 degrees was perfect for me.  If it is too hot the outside will burn and the inside batter will be raw.  If it is not hot enough the  batter will slide off. I love these because they are crunchy on the outside.  Great recipe!!!!",

I added a bit more milk b/c the batter thickened after it came out of the fridge. Will make again",
