I didn't change a thing about the recipe and they turned out tasty. I think I expected a cookie that didn't flatten out though. I rolled them in balls but they ended up flat. I think maybe I'd put a little more flour in next time to help them be a little drier like shortbread. Also I did not need to grease the pans. The first pan I put in burned on the bottom because of the oil on the pan but the next 2 came out better without greasing. Also it made 36 cookies for me.",
