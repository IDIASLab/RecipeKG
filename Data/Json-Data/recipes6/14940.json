Also i think all these past reveiwers are mixing the ingredients wrong. The reason why its so wet or not a dough like texture is because your not pouring the liquids in a small well in the middle of the dry ingredients. I make muffins all the time and this was a great recipe :)",

I think if your recipe is too liquidy, its because you are beating the egg or stiring your muffin mix too much. Unlike a cake mix, you are supposed to fold in the ingrediants not stir them. If you stir them you end up with liquid rubbery muffins with holes in the middle of your muffins ..just a little fyi",
