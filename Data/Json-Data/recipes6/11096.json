                "reviewBody": "Loved this! Classic German cake that isn't too sweet! As an avid baker from a German family, 5 stars!!! Tastes great with wine! To combat some of the more popular complaints of it being too dry or crumbling I did a few things different. \nFirst, I used half and half instead of milk, which I recommend for almost all dessert recipes, especially cakes! \nI also separated the yolks from the egg whites and then whipped the egg whites until a nice froth appears. This allows more air into the cake, allowing it to rise more during baking and create a more fluffy texture. Beat the yolks into the batter first, and then add the whipped egg whites. \nIn addition I added an extra tablespoon of coco powder for my personal preference of extra chocolate.\nFinally, after greasing my pan with butter I coasted it with raw sugar instead of flour. This creates a sweet and crunchy crust on the bottom of your cake. This is great for recipes that aren't already super sweet (like this one)! \nHope this helps!",

My sister and I have been wanting this cake again for years but my grandmother (who is German as well) never made it. Thank you sooo much for putting this recipe on here. It is exactly the cake we had at my Aunts! I made it exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfect. I didn't need to bake it for 70 minutes, having it in for about 60 was perfect. I did separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and mixed them separately and it seemed very fluffy but I'm not sure of the difference as it was the same from when i had it in Germany. For the people who said the cake was very dry, this is how it was at my aunts. This cake was amazing and i will definitely be making this over and over again! I didn't need to add any vanilla pudding as others did or change anything and it wasn't dry. This is the perfect cake to have with tea!",
