The only way I could mold the dough around the caramel half was to spray my hands with Pam about every third cookie - so it was time consuming and messy. Also after the cookies cool the caramels harden. Even though they are not my favorite I did get a lot of compliments.",

I actually didn't have a problem molding the dough around the carmel but I had a problem getting them off of the cookie sheet without crumbling a bit and then getting them off of the cooling rack because the carmel would stick to it. But if you can get over that they are tasty!",
