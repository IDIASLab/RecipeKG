The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the hot sauce by half. While delicious this would have been way to spicy for my child. Can always add more after! I didn't have jerk seasoning so I made my own. That may have also significantly changed the level of spicy I ended up with! For the sauce After cooking and draining the noodles I put the cream cheese sour cream and other sauce ingredients into the hot pan to melt. THEN added it into the meat/veggies. Making sure the sauce was smooth and keeping the form of the pretty veggies! Thank you for a great recipe! I'll be making it again!",

The only thing that I will say for me anyways is that next time I will not add the carrot as I'm not a big fan and it didn't do anything for me. I do think other veggies could be added with success like maybe spinach or zucchini. Also taste and salt accordingly. I had to add more than called for. This would also be great subbing sausage for the ground beef though the ground beef was fine. All around this was good and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
