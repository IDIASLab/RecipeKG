I used baked yams (1-1/2 lbs = 2 medium size yams - perfect for 2 cups) cut back sugar in the pie to 1/2 cup (1/4 cup white 1/4 cup brown) and 1/3 cup brown sugar in the topping. I also used pumpkin pie spice (1 teaspoon) and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Yam mixture seemed very runny when I put it in the pie crust but cooked up nicely. Watch the topping carefully under the broiler - cooks quickly. The ''Butter Flaky Pie Crust\" was easy and delicious too. This pie IS NOT low cal but it doesn't have corn syrup or sweetened condensed milk (YEAH). You could probably make it with Splenda egg beaters and fat-free half & half and it would still be good. My compliments to Lorrie... this pie will definitely be on my holiday table!",

I didn't find the sweet potato mix spicy enough so I doubled the spices (more or less) and added a little nutmeg. The sweet potato mix came out to be FAR more than my 9 inch pie could handle so I made a few small tarts to use up the extra. As someone else said watch the sugar mixture on the top VERY carefully - mine was done in just under 2 minutes. I also tried to add whole pecan halves on the top but they burned under the broiler - I would say if you are going to add \"decorative\" pecans do it just after you pull the pie from the broiler while the sugar is still soft.",
