I am writing a review just to show how versatile this recipe is. I actually did it with what I had on hand and that was strawberries! They needed a little more sugar but the taste was not weird. And so I encourage others to give this recipe a try with whatever fruit you have on hand. I may try apples next time but with thicker chops since the thin ones tend to become leather-like in the blink of an eye.  So happy I took a risk.",
