You don't have to refrigerate this dough at all, it's ready to use as soon as you make it. Good job!! I would give this 10 or more stars if possible!",

Nothing extraordinary about it other than there are no problems or issues with the recipe - and in my mind, that's a good thing.  I added a little salt to make the flavor come alive, just shy of 1/2 teaspoon.  Rather than margarine, which I never use, I substituted half butter and half shortening. What I particularly liked about this recipe is that while most peanut butter cookie recipes call for equal amounts of fat and peanut butter, this one calls for a smidge more peanut putter.  I rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar, then pressed the criss-cross pattern into the cookie with more granulated sugar rather than flour.  They came out of the oven shaped pretty much the same way they went in - no surprises, which is also a good thing.  The cookie has a light texture and is slighty crispy.  These are rather small cookies, so I might consider making the dough balls bigger for a more generous-sized cookie.",
