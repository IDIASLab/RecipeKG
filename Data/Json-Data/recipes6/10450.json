I did find the butter/sugar in the tins got more crispy-carmelized than get syrupy-gooey (which was fine by me!)... but if you wanted it gooey, you could set aside half the mixture for the roll filling, and then add some melted butter to the rest of it until it was more syrupy than pasty in consistancy.

I couldn't find my raisins, so I used craisins, and converted the icing to a cream cheese icing by adding 2-3 tablespoons cream cheese, an extra tablespoon of milk, and a couple of tablespoons of butter.  FANTASTIC.  Tasted like the Hardee's biscuit cinnamon rolls.  I gave them a 10, my husband gave them a 7 (he prefers the cinnabon type yeast roll).  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I won't make it again but I do have some helpful hints for those who will try it. First as everyone else stated the dough is extremely sticky so make sure to flour your hands and also put a little extra on the dough when you begin to roll it out. Second make sure that you trim the dough to be a perfect retangle as it will aid in the helping the final product look normal. Third don't waste time spooning 1 tsp of the brown sugar mixture into the pans. Instead after cutting the cinnamon rolls dip each roll into the sugar and then place in the muffin pans. It's much easier this way. Also after 18 minutes check them they won't need 20-25 minutes unless your oven runs cold. And lastly do not use the recommended amounts for the icing. You'll have to wing it by placing the confectioners sugar in a bowl and adding tsp's not tablesoons of milk until you get a creamy glaze. I hope this helps anyone else who chooses to make these but I would highly recommend taking the time to prepare them the RIGHT WAY!",

I didn't use muffin tins since I can't find em LOL I put these in a 9x13 glass cake pan.  And had to sub 1/2 the br. sugar for regular since thats all I had.  Put a thin layer of the br.sugar butter mixture in the bottom of the pan after spraying with cooking spray.  Put cinn rolls on there.  I rolled mine out a little thin because I came out with 16 with 2 end pieces, but put all in the 9x13 pan.  I thought they were going to stay small but they expanded very nicely filling the entire cake pan!  I had to bake about 25-27 mins.  I inverted them onto a baking sheet right away.  And just to get rid of some frosting in the fridge, I made a quick glaze and poured on top.  Very delicious! Thanks again for the recipe!",
