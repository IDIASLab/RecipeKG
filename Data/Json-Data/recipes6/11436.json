I can see why it might be called a cake, if frosting is used.  However, I chose to simply dust with confectioner's sugar.  It was very cake-like, kind of crumbly, and the yeast flavor was hard to detect.  My only change was to dice the apples, because I simply misread the ingredients.   A scoop of vanilla ice cream would be a delightful add-on.  I'm sure Aunt Lydia mastered the handling of this delicate, very sticky dough, but it was far beyond my ability.   I just patted the pieces together, and called it done.  The directions say to divide the dough in half, but actually, more is needed for the bottom and sides of the pan. Perhaps a more experienced baker would have been more successful than I, in getting the rolled out dough into the pan in one piece, even using parchment.  It was delicious, though, and DH approved!",
