This particular recipe falls into the latter category. With this in mind - it is an excellent example of \"Old Fashioned Apple Stack Cake\". The sweet/spicy apple mixture off sets the sour of the buttermilk in the layers. If you're looking for an authentic Appalachian Mountain Stack Cake - this is it.",
