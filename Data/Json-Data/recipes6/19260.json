I boiled the peanut butter mixture over the stove and it was having trouble getting to the right consistency so I added applesauce until it was runny enough to coat the cereal mixture. About 1/2 cup of applesauce worked great. A new favorite!:)",

I read the other reviews regarding the need for more liquid to hold the bars together and I found it wasn't really needed if you followed a few tips. First the peanut butter mixture needs to be really hot(like the recipe says- BUBBLING)- even after you mix in the powdered milk- if not it is virtually impossible to stir it into the cereal mixture. Also really press the mixture hard into the greased pan- pack it in and it will stay together. I found that we wanted the bars packed tight so that they would be more sturdy when packed for the trail without falling apart. Try adding different fruits and white chocolate instead of semi-sweet. My husband loved banana chips dates and white chocolate with the peanut butter. Again- GREAT recipe.",

This morning I made another batch this time I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup brown (the dried fruits have lots already) I added Wheat germ and ground almonds for additional calcium Vit B and minerals. They were tasty too and my grandchildren won't even suspect that there's wheat germ in them.Thanks for this great recipe that becomes a roadmap to better nutrition for our kids!",

These are so much tastier than store bought--super processed ones!!! Thanks for the recipe idea!",

Next time I will cook the mixture in a big pot on the stove then gradually add the cereal which I think will help it mix more evenly.
