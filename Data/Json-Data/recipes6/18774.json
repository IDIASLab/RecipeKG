Although I had the fruit blended instead of having them in as they were just soaked and I have also added 1/2 bottle of red label wine, 1/2 bottle of Grace Browning and even 1/2 cup more of white rum to my cake.

I ended up with so much batter, I filled up the two 9-inch round cake pans the recipe asks for, plus one 9x13 rectangular pan!!  When I put the cake pans in the oven, the batter started to rise nicely, but it suddently flattened, and I didn't open the oven door or did something to make it flatten.  The taste is not bad, but I couldn't taste the wine or rum at all.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I read the instructions very carefully to make sure I was doing everything right.  This fruitcake turned out to be a pain in the neck.\r\n",

                "reviewBody": "Ok this got 2 stars but only because the flavor is really good. This was a really difficult recipe partly because the directions don't seem very clear. Specifically the wine. If you soak the fruit in wine as suggested in the tips in small print on the bottom are you supposed to use the 2 cups that is listed in the recipe ingredients? Or is that 2 cups in addition to whatever the soaking takes? Same with the rum. I assumed maybe incorrectly that it was in addition to what was used in soaking. It did seem a little wet. But maybe it was supposed to... And as far as cooking time goes I inserted a knife in and it came out clean. Unfortunately after trying to get it out of the pan I discovered that it was cooked on the top actually starting to get a little darker than I like and still gooey toward the bottom and very dark on the very bottom. The cooked part must have been scraping off the gooey part as I was removing the knife. So I have a very good tasting but gooey mess that will be eaten by my immediate family (who are used to being guinea pigs) instead of something special I had wanted to take to a family dinner tonight. Fortunately there's still time to go to the store for something else. Some additional direction clarification by those who have been successful with this recipe would be helpful. I'd try it again if such help were available since as I said the taste even of the goo was very good.",

First of all you must add more flour to this recipe use your own judgment based on the consistency of the batter. Next if you like it dark then use more browning sauce. With regard to the rum/wine/brandy like another reviewer said I only put what I drink so I soaked my fruits for a week then boiled them on the stove for about an hour over medium low heat. I soaked them in Jamaican Appleton Brown Rum. That was fun! The most important thing I had to change for this recipe was the baking temperature. This has to bake slowly I turned my oven down to 250-275 for almost 1.5 hours. It is not going to rise much if at all but thats how a real rum fruitcake is. Once you take the cakes out pour more rum wine etc over them for that great moist taste. I am getting ready to make my batch for this year my husband keeps reminding me he loves this cake and can't wait!",
