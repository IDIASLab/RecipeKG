Its also very adaptable to your taste. The sky's the limit. Try any flavor or color of unsweetened drink mix in place of the blue.",

I could not find the blue drink mix, so I instead used a jug of the Blue Hawaiian Punch, the lemon lime soda and then white grape juice because I could not find white cranberry juice.  Everyone loved it!!!  And it was so cute with the ducks floating in it.  **I've since made this for Halloween using the green Hawaiian punch and floated those black plastic spider rings in it.  Too cute!**",

My punch bowl holds 6 quarts, and this recipe was just enough to fill my punch bowl to about 2 inches from the top.  I'm always disappointed about the lack of punch options for \"It's a Boy\" baby showers.  So I tried this punch recipe to see if it would work well for future baby showers.  I will definitely use it in the future, maybe even experiment with different colors of Kool-Aid that would be suitable for other party themes.  The one thing I would point out...I prefer Vanilla Bean ice cream, so out of habit, that's what I used when making this punch.  I didn't notice any vanilla beans in the punch itself, but there were tiny little black specks along the sides of the punch cups that resembled dirt.  I don't think the vanilla bean residue effected the flavor of the punch, but nonetheless others might prefer using an ice cream that doesn't include vanilla beans.  I submitted a photo of the Baby Blue Punch that I made, which was taken about 5 minutes after adding the ice cream scoops.  So you can see that it doesn't take long for the frothy blue clouds to develop.",

We went through 2 bowls of the punch for about 20 people.  This is a great, SUPER easy recipe!!",
