These are not your Krispy Kreme yeast-raised doughnuts!  They are traditional CAKE doughnuts.  They are MEANT to be a dense and heavy type of doughnut!  I read up on the reviews, heeded some advice and began with a little extra flour in my dough.  The time listed from start to end for this recipe was 25 minutes, and it was RIGHT ON!  I whipped these up, rolled them out, cut and fried.  My daughter rolled in sugar/cinnamon...and my family of five wolfed them down!  No problems here!  Nice recipe.  Simple and easy dough product.  Fun and delicious!",

There needs to be more of en explanation in the recipe, so I have to subtract a star from an otherwise perfect recipe, if I could subtract only one half of a star I would.  Let me tell you how to make this into perfect doughnuts.   Once the dough is mixed, chill it for just 15 minuets more or less. using a rubber spatula scrape it out & off the bowl onto a HEAVILY flour dusted counter top, and then also heavily dust the top of the dough with the flour. Now roll it flat & about 3/4 of an inch thick and cut as  directed now it will be easy to remove perfect doughnut shapes from the counter to the pan.",

In fact, I ommitted the nutmeg and cinammon, so the ingredients were few and basic, but the cooking process was not.  \r\n\r\nI scaled the recipe for four servings, and instead of adding 1/3 of an egg, I added a whole egg, thinking it would make the doughnuts richer.  The dough came out extremely sticky and goooey, and it was impossible to roll out.  Half the dough was wasted on my hands, the board, and the roller.  I tried to fry whatever chunks of dough I could, only to have the dough become burnt black in a matter of seconds, causing smoke to fill my apartment.  I boldly bit into one, only to find that the inside was still soft and raw.  I threw away everything: the remaining dough, and the black, grossly shaped chunks.  I went to sleep, vowing to get the recipe right the next morning.\r\n\r\nThis morning I remade the doughnuts, but took several precautions:\r\n\r\n1)I followed the recipe EXACTLY, so that the dough would not become too sticky.\r\n\r\n2)I used flour liberally on the board where I placed the dough, and put flowers on my hands, and on the roller, to prevent the dough from sticking everywhere.\r\n\r\n3)I flattened the dough to exactly 1/4 of an inch, using a ruler to measure the thickness.  This was to make sure that the doughnut would be cooked completely before the outside burned.\r\n\r\n4)I put in a small piece of dough as I heated the oil.  When numer",
