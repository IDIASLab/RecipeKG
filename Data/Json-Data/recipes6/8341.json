After the soup was finished and heated through I added some fresh cilantro and about 3/4 t. liquid smoke. It was even better the second day! Next time I'll up the ginger garlic and have some fresh cut green onions on hand for a topping. It was also a recipe that was easily converted to a Weight Watchers recipe. Made with fat free chicken broth it was only 2 pts per serving!!",

I made this for my grandmother and because she can't swallow large pieces I chopped the shrimp into smaller bite sized pieces which worked out great for the kids too. The only other change I made was that I doubled the cornstarch. (I liked the soup a little thicker.) We ate it over white rice and everyone including the kids liked it. My husband says it's a keeper.
