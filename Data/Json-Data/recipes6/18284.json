Since it was a half-batch I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 TBS brown sugar (instead of all white). I only had pre-ground coffee so I added an extra 1/2 TBS and it was caramel-flavored - yummy! I also only used 1 cup of vodka instead of 1 1/4 cups. Next time I'll use 3/4 cup so the alcohol taste is lessened and I think I'll add the vanilla when I mix in the vodka to try to get more of the flavor but this is great! Oh and an easy way to strain it is to place a coffee filter in a large funnel and place that on top of a tall container so when you pour it in it will drip away at its own rate while you do something else. Thanks Janet for an excellent recipe!",
