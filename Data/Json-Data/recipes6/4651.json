Only change I made was using 1/2 onion as I had one large sweet onion. I thought the beans were perfectly cooked and to be honest I liked them straight out of the pot. they would have been good in soup or even on a salad. I never had a fresh cooked chickpea what a difference. Now about the hummus I did not care for it at all! The tahini taste is just overwhelming. Maybe some brands are more light tasting then others I don't know. The onions could also be tasted and gave it a boiled onion after taste. It was way too thick too. Now I have 3 full cups that no one will eat. I wish very much I would have just tested a portion of the beans. To top I have a very good mixer and I thought it was going to burn the motor. I smelled an odor as it tried to blend this stuff. I wish this would have worked and it didn't get tossed but at least I know how to cook beans in my pressure cooker. My rating is for the actual hummus. I would only make half of it at a time to get the flavor desired and use the best tahini possible.",
