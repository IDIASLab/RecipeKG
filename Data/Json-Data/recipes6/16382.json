This recipe had a great dough texture (I like my sticky buns to be realy yeasty and soft not like bread) and the flavor was very good but I ran into the problem I always do when I make cinnamon pecan sticky bun type stuff. Too Dry! not enough of the sticky stuff. So should I just triple the sauce recipe or something to make it more gooey? Other than that nice recipe easy but time consuming. Thanks. Update Dec. 5 2006: This is a great dough recipe but I use the caramel recipe on \"Cinnamon Rolls I\" posted on this site. I double the caramel recipe and use pecans rather than walnuts. Great!",

I took the advice from below and used the caramel sauce (doubled) from Cinnamon Rolls I and it was good. I also used the cream cheese frosting from Cinnamon Rolls II and it was awesome! Double the cinnamon and brown sugar that goes between the rolls too because there wasn't enough. I'll make these again to try to get them softer but was disappointed.",
