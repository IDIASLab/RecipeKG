I loved how simple this recipe is and the flavor is absolutely delicious. I ll definitely make this again using this recipe and will likely try variations including dark chocolate chips shredded coconut salt. Thanks to my friends at Maplewood Farms I resolved foaming by coating the inside lip of the pot with butter.",
