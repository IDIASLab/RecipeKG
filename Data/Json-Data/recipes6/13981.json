I think that this is a really good recipe, or at least the the base to a really great chili.  I have made it at least 3 times now.  I made it in a slow cooker/crockpot for the first time yesterday....came out thinner than in my soup pot, so keep that in mind(nonetheless, I thought it was my best tasting batch yet). I like a little more beans so I bought a bigger can of pinto beans.  I also put a small can of diced tomatoes for chili in the pot(my husband doesn't like chunks of tomatoes).  If I have any tomato products that I want to clean out of my fridge(ex. salsa, chili sauce, etc.), I throw those in too. I also use 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of the white.  And I am usually doubling the spices(except for the chili powder and I haven't tried cayenne pepper yet).  I really don't think you can go wrong with this. I get compliments everytime.  Since I am new to making chili, I keep referring to this one to make sure I get at least the basics in. Try it. Taste it.  And if you need to...modify to your taste.  That's what I do.  Then I usually put it on top of some macaroni noodles and top that with sharp cheddar, chopped onion, and Fritos....YUM!!!",

I saw this one and what caught my eye was the # of reviews, so I printed it up and tried it out.  I got rave reviews on my chili yesterday, so much so that my husband brought some to his mom to try; she's Italian and she even liked it!  I made a few changes as well - I replaced the tomato juice with 2 cans of plum tomatoes that I diced myself, I used dry kidney and pinto beans and soaked them in water the night before. I bought a can of chipotle peppers in tomato sauce and added two of the peppers from the can. I slow cooked overnight for 10 hours - the smell was divine, the taste - out of this world!  The chipotle peppers gave the chili a slight smokey taste and an extra zing that was well recieved.  This is definitely MY new chili recipe and will be going into our annual family cookbook!",

Its just one of those things that can be made SOOO different and be SOO good many different ways!! I thought this chili was good and especially good for a base chili and then you modify to make it suit your tastes. I followed others suggestions and cut out the tomato juice all together and used 2 cans tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. Next time I will only use 1 can tomato sauce. It seemed too thick but once it started heating up it was a little more liquidy than I liked. It was good though. My boyfriend rated it a 3.5. Me a 4 and our friend who was over a 5! So... anyways all in all I thought this was good especially for a beginner Chili Maker! Oh I also forgot to mention I browned my meat beforehand w/garlic cloves and onion and then put everything in the crock pot!",
