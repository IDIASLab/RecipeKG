                "reviewBody": "Lovely cookies, but just narrowly miss a 5 star because they're far more delicate than a true ginger snap. To those who are wondering what went wrong when the cookies come out as flat discs, the answer is absolutely nothing! Ginger snaps are supposed to be flat and very crisp. If you are looking for a puffy, soft ginger cookie recipe, I can heartily recommend \"Big Soft Ginger Cookies\" from this site. Even though I upped the baking time to 12 minutes, the edges were properly crispy, but the centers still remained chewy. The dough is extremely soft. I chilled it overnight, but it was still too soft to roll into balls by hand. So I scooped them out with two spoons, and rolled them around in the sugar. They spread out a lot while baking, so allow ample room on your baking sheet. Excellent, tasty cookies, just not crispy enough to be called gingersnaps. Edited to add: By evening, all had lost any crispiness and become chewy, which underscores the appropriateness of the 4 star rating. Again, delicious cookie, just not a true gingersnap, without any \"snap.\" Edited to add: I discovered how to make them properly crisp. Use vegetable shortening in place of the margarine, bake for 12 minutes and you'll have actual \"snaps.\" Also, in order to get that proper warmth that we associate with gingersnaps, add a few shakes of cayenne or white pepper. Perfect then!",
