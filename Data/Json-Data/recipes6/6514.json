We don\u2019t like liquid smoke, so I didn\u2019t add that, otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Good balance of sweet-tart with perfect sauce consistency.  Enjoyed  last night on grilled split chicken breasts, and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I\u2019ll make this again.",

Added more brown sugar, into the sauce too.  I wanted more sweet and heat, so I added Grape Jelly, and Cayenne Pepper.  Amazing.  A smoky flavor from maybe a smoked chili powder would have been great too.  Going to try that next time.  Simply amazing!",

I was so impressed with how easy this was and with the amazing amount of flavor. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much! And don't doubt the amount of liquid smoke that is in this recipe. It was actually the perfect amount and I would not change it at all.",
