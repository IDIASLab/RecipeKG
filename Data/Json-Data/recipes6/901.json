Because of the amount of dry ingredients in the honey, I was unable to drizzle it because it was just a sticky paste in the bowl, so added a little warm water to it. While trying to serve the squash, the glaze could be stretched a foot or longer!  If I made this again, the glaze would need some major tweaking.",
