I had a can of cherry-chocolate frosting in the pantry so I popped that in the microwave for 45 seconds and drizzled that over the cooled cake sprinkled it with chopped pecans and added a few maraschino cherries on top for decoration. It turned out really pretty and everyone like it. I also used half espresso half water for he coffee portion which really came through in the flavor. The cake alone is not overly sweet which was nice.",
