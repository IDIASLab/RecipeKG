This recipe was great but i did a few minor changes. Instead of semisweet chocolate I replaced it with Cadburys Dairy Milk bar instead and used more than 4 squares. I used the really giant sized bars over here and used most of it. I also used double fudge chocolate chip cookies for the crust since you cant find regular choc. cookies over here. For a good texture I did give it a water bath in the oven and I kept it a little longer than 40 minutes to get the smooth texture I was wanting. It turned out amazing and those who were lucky enough to take some home acted like they were taking home something really special. I'd definately fix this recipe again. It was easy and very irresistible!! A definate keeper!",
