As with most reviews on here I didn't do it exactly as it reads but only becuase I butchered my deer myself and didn't have a roast.  What I did have was the correct amount of meat by weight for the curing process.  This is actually the easiest thing I have ever made using venison and it tastes great.  I took it to work and nobody could believe it was venison.  I would highly recomend this.",
