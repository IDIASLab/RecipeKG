You can use your judgment for adding additional ingredients such as nuts shredded coconut raisins or chocolate chips and usually 1 cup of any or a combination is what is called for. If I add additional ingredients that are sweet I cut back the sugar just my preference and what I like. I find that patting the ingredients down in the pan with a fork helps it stay to together. It's delicate but you will be able to pick up a slice once cooled. It's great crumbled into a bowl of milk too.",

The taste was good and with yogurt or milk (almond or soy would be great) this could be a breakfast staple.
