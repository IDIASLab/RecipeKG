After cooking (30 minutes until a bit golden on top...) and letting cool for 10 minutes, then dug in to the casserole.  Using the canned hatch chilies, it had an overall tart flavor.  It also was too salty for my palate.  The cheese is thick and chewy in texture, with not a lot of flavor except salt, like a mozzarella.  (I would cut the salt in half.)  The ranchero sauce was bold with spices, on the thin side, and again, a bit too salty for me, but tasted good on it's own.  Too much sauce can overwhelm the casserole flavorwise, which may be the point.    The overriding flavors were salt and tart and if using the sauce a bold flavored sauce that almost over-road the chile flavor.  It baked up nicely.",
