Sprinkle with 2 chopped green onions and garlic salt.  Fry until golden. Mix with steamed broccoli.  Serve serve the bulgogi over top of the noodle. 5 stars. Chicken had AMAZING FLAVOR.

I wound up finishing mine on a sheet pan in the oven so I could broil it to crisp up the skin a bit, and also bc it was sort of stewing in my 12-inch skillet. I think in the future I'd just broil it right from the get-go, the internet is full of instructions on how to do that if you're curious to try that route. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The key thing I do is to saute until all the liquid is gone and everything has more or less caramelized. It's amazing this way!  I served it over a couple packages of ramen noodles cooked with a chicken bullion cube and some frozen peas.  Also made an Asian slaw salad with mandarin oranges and  browned almonds in it.  Everything accidentally got mixed together on the plate, and boy, was that good!  This is definitely going on our frequent flyer list.  When my brother-in-law had it recently, he couldn't stop raving about it.  Said he wanted it for his next birthday dinner!",
