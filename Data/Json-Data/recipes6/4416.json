To me, this recipe was awfully greasy, but the flavor was so good and the recipe so unique that, with the butter halved, I think it will be absolutely exceptional.  Per other reviews, I broiled the asparagus (cut and placed on foil-lined, greased cookie sheet, sprinkled with salt/pepper/garlic, and broiled for 3-4 minutes) and toasted 3/4 cup cashews (reused the foil lined sheet and broiled for 1 minute).  Be warned that the spaghetti browns really quickly in the butter, so next time I might brown the rice first and then add in the spaghetti to brown.  Finally, I did not have nearly enough liquid to cook all that rice -- I ended up adding almost 3/4 cup of water towards the end, but it still turned out beautifully.  Again, next time I will reduce the butter to 2T (and I like things buttery, but this left a lot of greasy residue on the plate, which for me means it's too much).",

Now I only put in Asparagus if I have leftovers, and I rarely add the cashews - it's very good either way.  Obviously, this recipe is a keeper for me!  FIRST REVIEW JUNE 03: This Pilaf recipe offers a nice presentation and has great taste and texture.  I substituted the vegetable broth with chicken and would do that again.  Instead of boiling asparagus I broiled it in the oven, and would also toast the cashews next time as another reviewer suggested. I also enjoyed the browned spaghetti in this dish.  Excellent recipe, Sandy T., thanks!",

I used chicken broth and then chicken base granules instead of salt. Also, substituted orzo instead of the spaghetti. And, I highly recommend that you french-slice the raw asparagus then saute in garlic, pinch of salt and olive oil/butter blend. The asparagus stays green and slightly firm. Better texture than steamed. Everyone really liked this dish. I will definitely make this again.",

In place of the vegetable broth, I use home made chicken stock from a recipe on this site, \"Chicken Stock in a Slow Cooker\" which allows you to control the sodium content and is fabulous.  Freeze the chicken stock and take with you in your ice chest which acts as a freezing component/ ice.  Cooked the asparagus on the grill until al dente, which retained the beautiful green color and toasted the cashews before leaving home.  Yes, I know it's very similar to the Rice a Roni recipe which would probably be much easier to pack camping, but this recipe tastes SO much better.  Little extra work than the boxed variety, but so worth it!",

To make the measurements easier than they are in the recipe, I used one bunch asparagus (roasted in the oven while the rice soaked up the broth), 1 cup cashews (roasted alongside the asparagus at 300), 2 garlic cloves.  I wasn't sure what 2 oz of spaghetti would be, so I bought it in bulk at a health food store and I actually used 4 oz.  Everything else I kept the same.  It was a perfect balance.
