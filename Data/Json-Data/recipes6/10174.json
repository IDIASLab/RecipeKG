I used Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour/Meal for the crust (his favorite part) and for the custard I used raw honey which I had to double to keep from being too tart. He liked the crust better than the custard. His family preferred the custard! I thought it was perfect that this recipe makes a small amount--in keeping with the idea that someone on a diet doesn't want to incorporate large amounts of sweets. There is probably something out there in the paleo world that could be added to these ingredients to make them a little more like sugar-induced lemon tarts so I'll have to do a little searching.",

However I think I could have cut back on the lemon rind just to reign it in a little bit. I added a little agave to balance things out. As for the crust - I read that clarified butter is cleared on the paleo list so I did substitute 1 tablespoon for one of the tablespoons of lemon juice to avoid it being too tough. Turns out it's lovely! I'll keep experimenting with the filling - it's almost there! Thanks for posting:)",

I might mess with the ingredients a bit to get it to bake up better. The lemon curd was good though very tart even after adding extra honey but I didn't mind since I like tart tarts:). I ran fresh peeled lemons through my juicer which would be tarter than bottled juice. I used regular sized muffin cups and could have gotten 5 tarts out of it more if you made them shallower which I think would be a good idea. A little of the filling goes a long way! Oh and I didn't have paper cups so I very lightly greased nonstick tins which worked just fine. Overall the filling is very good but the shells are ok at best. It was quick and easy to put together.",
