Even though my version changes every time I make it here are some basic ingredients to try: to the margarita mix add 3-4 chopped garlic cloves 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon of salt (or 1 tablespoon of soy sauce) freshly ground black pepper. Sometimes I also add some chili powder for some kick. The method of marinading chicken breast in margarita mix makes for very tender and juicy grilled chicken breast that could otherwise end up very dry; also marinading even for an hour infuses a good amount of flavor into the meat. Definitely try it but be sure to pick a margarita mix you like.",
