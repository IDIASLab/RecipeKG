This soup tastes like something wonderful from that Restaurant. Very Gourmet. Very Vegetarian. I give it 5 stars. The Curry adds a bite/zing that I loved. DH (Meat & Taters Guy) gave it a 4 Star rating & proceeded to put handfuls of Fishy Crackers in it so he could eat it. This would be wonderful for a Fall Meal Cold Night. Good comfort food. I was thinking it also could be used over some kind of pasta with other Veggies. I could be a Vegetarian. DH - Not so much. It tastes very creamy - without the cream. I did not toast the pumpkin seeds (not our thing) & did not have Pumpkin Seed Oil. Delish without it.",
