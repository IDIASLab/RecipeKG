I can see how the name is misleading, but it is NOT supposed to be like the fudge that you get at the candy store.\r\n\r\nIt's also not like brownies-- it's supposed to be a little runny and mushy. The reviewers who have given this one star based on the fact that it is mushy have not made a mistake-- that's how it is SUPPOSED to turn out if it is baked fudge.\r\n\r\nIf you want baked fudge, this is a fantastic recipe. If you want candy fudge or brownies, this is not the recipe for you.\r\n\r\nThat being said... I love my grandmother's baked fudge and this was just like it! It was so delicious that I ate about two full servings- after a full meal- and I usually can't even finish one adult dessert serving. Mmmmm. I was a little intimidated about the roasting pan and the water, but it was very easy and VERY VERY worth it! THANKS",

I cooked it almost 1 and a half hours at 300 and still had pudding in the bottom of the pan. Increasing the oven to 425 and cooking another 10 minutes finished it off.",
