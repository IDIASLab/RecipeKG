The only problem with it is the cranberries are overpowered by the spices. If I make it again I'll leave out either the cranberries or the spices. The base cake itself is really great and I recommend this recipe.",

By the way, I used light olive oil (not the extra virgin one) and omitted the cranberry and spices, and instead added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon lemon flavoring, and 1 tbsp grated orange zest.  It was delicious.  My revised name for this cake is \"Mediterranean Orange Cake\".  I also made a glaze using powdered sugar and some orange juice.",

My Mom and Dad loved this cake the sweetness and spices were just right for us and I loved the occasional tartness of cranberry. I did make 2 changes I used corn oil and used 4 whole eggs for more flavor instead of 6 egg whites. I separated the eggs adding the yokes while putting in the buttermilk. I will definitely be making this recipe over and over again.",
