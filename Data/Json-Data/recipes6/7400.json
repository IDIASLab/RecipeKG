The only problem I found was for first time won ton makers (like myself) it would have been VERY helpful to know that you cannot stack the precooked won tons together. I had no idea that when I was ready to cook them I would have a HUGE ball of sticky dough that could not be pulled apart! Out of the 100 I had made I had to throw out quite a big pile of useless goo. Please make sure when you make this recipe to lay your won tons side by side and keep covered so they don't dry out. Also the recipe makes 10 servings - I tripled it and made about 150 won tons for a party.",

They were a hit - everybody liked them (of course I didn't tell them the ingredients until after they tried them). I really minced/ground up the filling for a nice even consistency (I put the cubed spam & water chestnuts in my cuisinart) & added an extra Tbsp of the oyster sauce b/c mixture seemed a little dry. Also I used SCRAMBLED eggs instead of hard boiled (it was quicker). I used regular spam & did NOT find it to be too salty. I made the wontons ahead of time covered w/ plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for a couple of hours. Brought them to my friends' and fried them up there (it just takes a few minutes) This made about 50 DELICIOUS wontons. Served these with a bottled sweet & sour sauce for dipping- although they were also good without the sauce. Will definitely make a double batch for an upcoming luau. Thanks for the recipe.",

Even at home my family couldn't leave them alone. I deep fried mine in a deep fryer and they came out nice and crispy. I did change the ingredients around a bit instead of egg I used mango (canned or fresh works great) and I used about an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple as well. Also if you have problems working with the wonton skins use egg roll skins instead. They are much larger and easier to stuff and handle. Awesome recipe once again. Thanks a million.",

I had a hard time using the regular sized won-ton wrappers so I used the larger sized wrappers and I rolled them up like egg rolls. They were a LOT easier to work with. To save time I scrambled the eggs like another reviewer suggested. I added some chinese hot mustard alongside the sweet and sour sauce like they do in Chinese restaurants.
