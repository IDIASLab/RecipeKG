It was made with 1 l/4 cup of orange juice instead of frozen), 1 cup of water, all the rest of the ingredients were the same except that you added one egg white when you are ready to blend it.  That is what gives it the froth!  I'm sure there really isn't much difference if you use orange juice or frozen but adding the egg white really adds to the appearance.",

The schnapps overpowered the vanilla taste (I LOVED the vanilla taste) but tasted very good.  I'll be making this again!
