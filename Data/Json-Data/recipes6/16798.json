I stayed true to the original recipe and the batter was light & crispy -- almost like a tempura. Some reviewers were disappointed because this is not the typical 'donut shop' fritter but that's not what I think of when I think fritter. I think of a flatter lighter item. In this case to keep it from becoming an 'apple pancake ' I used a cookie scoop to drop the batter. I scooped up mainly apples chunks (coarsely chopped 1/2\" chunks) then drizzled the batter enough to make it the fritter. I also used coconut oil which gave it an interesting flavor. After I flipped it once in the pan I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar over it. After cooking I transferred to a plate with paper towels on it and sprinkled powdered sugar on it. Served w/warm maple syrup.",
