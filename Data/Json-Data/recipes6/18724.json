The changes I made were to use all-purpose flour fresh mango that I pureed in the blender using 2 of the smaller and tastier yellow mangoes and I sprinkled organic cane sugar on top. I loved the crunchy topping and the texture of the inside of the bread - nice and moist. I noticed that in a couple of pieces there were small mango chunks and these pieces were particularly good leading me to believe that maybe the mango amount should be doubled with one ripe mango cut into small chunks. I would add even more fresh cranberries next time and maybe a bit less walnuts or even leave them out altogether. Very nice bread that I would make again. The orange zest is also subtle but definitely adds flavor. Thanks for this recipe!!",

My Mom insisted I go back in & rate it 5 stars! FIRST REVIEW 8-22-06: I didn't have cranberries but used raspberries with good results. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup & because I only had 3/4 cup mango puree I increased the oil to 1/3 cup; decreased the baking powder by 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla & a couple dashes cinnamon. EVEDDER is right--the mango is very subtle; it makes a moist loaf with a nice texture not a whole lot of flavor though. Still a nice recipe that I will make again--thanks Sue.",

The mango taste is subtle but delicious. Fairly easy to make. At 259 cals per smallish slice it's not a dieter's friend but makes a perfect special treat. I followed the recipe to the letter except for substituting chopped cashews for the walnuts (you have to use what you got right?)",

The first time I left out the orange zest and it tasted very wheaty at first followed by the cranberry taste (I couldn't taste the mango). I should note that this time I used older wheat flour. The second time I used fresh flour with a bit of orange zest (about half of what it called for). I also added about 1/3 c millet and I sprinkled a bit of turbinado sugar on top before baking. This time it was a lot sweeter. You could taste the orange first then the cranberry. The millet added a wonderful crunch. Everyone like or loved this recipe. Also FYI the amount of mango called for is about 1 whole mango.",

A quick way is to food process the mangos then the cranberries then the walnuts to get them ready. I did not use 1 tsp. salt - that's way too much. Cut it down to 1/2 tsp. salt. I used Olive Oil instead of Canola. The top comes out crunchy. It's very good. I also doubled it and made muffins. I got two medium loafs one large and 12 medium muffins by doubling it.
