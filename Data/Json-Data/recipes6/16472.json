After it cooled I decided to try a piece as I had made 3 of them and 1 was going to my brothers for Thanksgiving. Something is very wrong with this Recipe. The sugar content is way way too high. I may try it again but will use less than half of what it calls for in sugar.I think GrandMa didn't like her Daughter inlaw and tried to put the Grand Kids into a sugar rush.",

I didn't see that they changed the taste THAT much, I just don't like a lot of eggs.  The two differences are: is I use 4 eggs, instead of 5, and I mix two tablespoons of flour with the sugar.  This is a great easy recipe.  Thanks for posting.",

(brush frozen pie crust with butter, prick crust to prevent bubble, bake as directed on pkg) I also reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, increased vanilla to 1/2 tablespoon, instead of using a whole pkg of coconut, I placed a couple handfuls into the bottom of the baked pie crust, then poured the filling over the top.  I baked it for 20 min @ 400, then reduced heat to 350 and baked the remaining time.  Perfection!",
