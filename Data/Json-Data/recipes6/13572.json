I started out with 1/4 cup of water, threw in the sugar, cornstarch and fresh strawberries.  I kept the extra water near just in case.  After it all came to a boil, I lowered the heat and let it sit stirring occasionally.  It thickened up in no time so I threw out the rest of the water.  I followed the rest of the recipe and the cobbler was gone within 10 minutes of serving it.  My neighbor even took half of it home to share with his family because he loved it so much.  ",

While making it I told my husband I didn't think it would taste very good because there was no spice (like cinnamon) in it just flour sugar and butter... not even lemon! I was getting frustrated because the recipe wasn't specific in the cooking time of the berry sauce and I wasn't sure what consistency it should come out at. My sauce got to a point where it was bubbling but no longer getting thick. I also wasn't sure exactly what \"dot with margarine\" meant. I ended up slicing bits of margargine up and dropping on top of the hot berry sauce... that was how I interpreted that term. I thought the batter was going to be the worst but as my husband says: \"the cake is what makes this recipe!\" I think the texture of the cake was perfect and I really loved how that brown sugar and maragarine glaze came out. The fresh strawberries had a tonne of flavour it was amazing! If you are planning on having some cobbbler left over try not to over thicken the berry sauce... it reheats double as thick (tastes just as good though). In the end I'd say I don't think there is much you can do to goof this one up. Thanks for this strawberry recipe which is now hubby's favourite cobbler!",

I used a pyrex glass pan to make this dish in. I of course did as others suggested. I used 3 cases of strawberries which was approx. 6 cups of strawberries. I added a little bit extra sugar because of the extra ammount of strawberries so I say it was probably about 3/4 cup. I added what one reviewer stated 1 1/2 TBSP of cornstarch although I will probably add 2 TBSP next time. I did not cook the strawberry mixture and I left out the water as it was perfect the way it was. I did take the 2 TBSP butter and cut off little pieces to place through out the strawberry mixture once in the pan. I thought the dough mixture was just perfect with the ammount though. I baked it for longer which I thought was very helpful! I baked it for about 40 mins. I then made the brown sugar mixture which I added a little bit of cinnamon and vanilla for flavor...just a splash of each. I brushed the brown sugar mixture over top of it all. Then I baked for close to 20 more mins. Any longer and I think it would have burned but it cooked the dough part enough to make it non cake like. Through and through it was excellent and I will be enjoying this recipe for a long long time!",
