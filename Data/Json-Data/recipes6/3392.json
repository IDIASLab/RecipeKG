Speaking of favorite things, Boston cream pie is one of my all-time favorite desserts, and this was basically an individually portioned, probably superior version of that. These would be great filled with all kinds of things, but it's hard to beat vanilla bean pastry cream (see footnote).",

Outside really is crisp and caramel-sweet, contrasting nicely with the soft eggy dough and vanilla cream inside, not to mention the pleasant bite of chocolate at the bottom. As suggested by another reviewer, I cut a hole in the bottom to fill the buns, which was immediately hidden after being covered with chocolate. Given that the craquelin crust and vanilla pastry cream need time to freeze/refrigerate, I suggest making those things the night before you're going to make the buns. Also, don't forget you're going to need pastry bags to pipe out the buns as well as to fill them, though a ziplock bag with a corner cut off can do in a pinch. This recipe's a keeper!",
