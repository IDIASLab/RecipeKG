I used a sliced Italian crusty bread but it was too thin and not substantial enough so I'll stick to the crusty French loaf, sliced about 1\" thick, and day old for better absorption without getting mushy. Great recipe! You won't regret it! Lorraine",

I made the dish as the direction say (except I added extra cinnamon to the egg mixture as well as the top). I also added fresh blueberries prior to baking. I lowered the temperature to 350 and baked it for a full hour. The result was a delicious bread pudding/french toast casserole.\nI hope this helps!",

I forgot to assemble the night before, so I made it in the morning and let it sit for about 90 min, checking every 15-20 min and pressing the top layer down to ensure it absorbed the egg mixture. I cooked for 35-40 min, and it puffed up tremendously. It was still a little wet in the middle, so next time I'll probably reduce the heat to 425 or 400 and cook for 45-50 min. Seriously good, and an impressive presentation for little work! EDIT: The caramel on the bottom can burn if left in too long, even as the top looks fine. Next time I'll stick with 35ish  min.",

I made a half recipe and put it in a 7\" x 11\" pan.  Be sure to spray your baking dish with cooking spray as the caramel sauce on the bottom wants to stick to the pan.  The bread was cook all the way through and not the least bit mushy in the middle.  That is why we enjoyed this recipe so much.  I served this with scrambled egg whites, fresh oranges and the 'Absolute Best Pancake Syrup' from AR.  It certainly didn't need the syrup, but it was delicious, none-the-less, on this breakfast treat that will be a repeat in our house.",

Before placing it into the fridge for the night I mixed all the ingredients in the pan so the brown sugar/butter mixture was not just on the bottom of the pan but spread throughout the bread. This also helped make sure the egg mixture got to all sides of the bread. I used fresh challah and it looked very soggy but it all cooked well and puffed up nicely. I skipped the brown sugar on top and cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  It was perfect and so easy! If you're concerned about using eggs, I used egg beaters and couldn't tell the difference.",
