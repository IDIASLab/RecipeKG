Here's a secret idea that I got from a restaurant...Toast a slice in a toaster over then drizzled with caramel sauce (homemade is the best) and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Amazing.

Here's why: Please remember there are three distinctly different choices when it comes to molasses, as it will impact your recipe's flavor quite a lot. 1) Unsulphured Molasses is the sweetest, with a mild molasses taste.  2) Sulphured Molasses is less sweet, more minerally, with a stronger molasses taste. 3) Blackstrap Molasses is not very sweet at all, has a hard, licorice-like flavor... so choose carefully, your satisfaction will depend on it. And yet how many of these recipes recommend any one kind... they just say molasses...lol, is it just me?",
