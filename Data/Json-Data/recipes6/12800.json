All Norwegian homes must serve at least 7 kinds of cookies at Christmas. This recipe is different from other pepperkaker recipes on this web site because it calls for cream and does not use eggs. So it's great for any who can't eat eggs. Enjoy!",

I don't reccomend doing this as it doesn't all fit in the bowl! Also the cardamom was like 13! Oh well live and learn.",
