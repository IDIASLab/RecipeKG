I'm lucky enough to enjoy real Memphis rub (in Memphis!) about 3-4 times a year and, looking over the ingredients, I knew instantly this needed some tweaking. It just didn't seem to have the zest or the complexity of Memphis rubs I've become familiar with and love. First, if you've got a good blend of spices to begin with, the MSG isn't necessary - so I left it out. I also reduced the cayenne by half and used a sweet paprika. The ingredients listed were fine, it's just that it was clear there were also some seasonings glaringly missing.  I don't profess to be a Memphis rub expert, but after I added (for a half recipe) 1-1/2 T. of chili powder, 1 tsp, cumin, and 1 tsp. each of dried oregano and thyme, this rub came alive. Hubby grilled our ribs with it, low and slow, then served them with BBQ sauce on the side. Delicious.  Wish I would have made the full recipe!",

I saw a program on Food Network that talked about using rubs on meat when BBQing...so I decided to try one.  I had all the ingredients needed for this recipe along with a nice slab of pork ribs.\n\nI mariniated the ribs for about 3 hours before grilling.  I grilled the ribs approximately 1 1/2 hours.  They were perfect.  The meat fell off the bone and my family pratically licked the platter clean.  The only change I made to the recipe is to NOT use MSG.",

So far I've used it on grilled chicken breast beef tenderloin hamburgers pork tenderloin and salmon. I don't doubt that it's fabulous on ribs too. Like others I omitted the MSG and used meat tenderizer instead. And you can always make it a bit peppier by increasing the cayenne and/or dry mustard. However I have to disagree with one reviewer who said it was like the rub used by the Rendezvous restaurant in Memphis. If you like Rendezvous ribs then add a bunch of cumin and it'll be close. Thanks for a great recipe that also saves me a ton of money!",
