I used Braeburn apples since our choice of apples are not the same as they are in the states. I think using Braeburn apples was far better than the typical American apples I've grown up eating. This cake is even better the next day when kept in an air-tight container; it actually makes the cake more moist. I used the walnuts like it called for, but I made this again a week later and did not use them. I'm not a fan of nuts in recipes, but I think this recipe is perfect with the nuts but even better without them!! Simple ingredients, easy to make and absolutely delicious. I couldn't ask for any better!    \n\n***After consulting my neighbor who happens to have moved to Holland from Romania, she told me that this in it's traditional Romanian form does NOT involve walnuts at all. Just thought I'd pass that bit of information along.***",

She diced the apples finely probably because her teeth were not so good anymore. This tastes best about a day or so after cooking and, for a cake, keeps quite well. Any substitutions detract from the authenticity and longevity of the cake; applesauce spoils much faster than oil, I always say that the bacteria, mold etc. have healthy tastes, they don't eat junk foods as they have no nutrients! So it is not healthy, but a delicious hearty spice cake that anyone not overly concerned about their diet will enjoy a slice of. It tastes a bit like apple pie or apple sauce but as a cake. And it does have a lot of apples, so you get a good dose of fruit. Alright enough rambling but I am happy to have found this recipe and be able to make my grandmother's cake!",

I used five kinds of apples (Macintosh Granny Smith Gala Pink Lady and Jonagold). I baked it in a bundt pan and then when it cooled (to make it pretty for sharing) I drizzeled it with glaze that I made with powdered sugar milk vanilla cinnamon and a dash of salt. I will say that I like others thought I'd done something wrong when I was through mixing the batter. It's all apples! But as it bakes the cake puffs up and around the apples and it's just yummy. I love the big apple chunks. It's like apple pie meets spice cake. So good! I'll be making this a lot in the future.",

I would have liked to see some more cinnamon in it. Good warmed up. Did powdered sugar glaze for the top but it doesn't really need anything. Thanks for the recipe. 10/26/09 I have made this 3 times since this review just a hint I used about 4 cups of sliced apples as most apple cake/crisp recipes use this amount. Since varying apples are different sizes (mine are huge I only use two for 4 cups) it helps to know how much instead of how many. 9/12/2010 made apple muffins from this. Used 4 Cups of apples subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil(which I always do) made in dark muffin pans lowered temp to 325 cooked 22 to 24 minutes got 18 muffins. Still great!",
