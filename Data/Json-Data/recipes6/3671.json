I am not familiar with brown onions and used a yellow onion instead and I used the dried cilantro instead of the epazote as the recipe submitter suggested. I wasn't thrilled about adding the cinnamon but it was actually the cardamon that overpowered the dish. I recommend scaling that way back. These were okay but not something I would make again...sorry.",
