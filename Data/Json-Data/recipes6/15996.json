It is very easy to throw together and the orange juice really compliments the flavor well! An added bonus that is a family tradition in my house - the little ones are given the responsiblity of putting the miniature marshmallows in PERFECT rows on top of the mashed sweet potatoes. It gives them something to do makes them feel as if they helped prepare the Thanksgiving meal also (what smiles when you tell them what a great job they did!) and it keeps them out of your hair for at least 15-20 minutes while they are busy at the table! My six year old son loved doing it! I am 45 years old and this has been my job at Thanksgiving since I was about his age. Some family traditions never change- just the recipe gets better!",
