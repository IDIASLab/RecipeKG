I agree with the one reviewer who said this is the perfect chocolate flavor - not too sweet, not too bitter, and not at all 'fake' chocolate tasting.  Perfect!!!  Directions are very good, was very easy to prepare.  After it was completely cooled, I dusted the top with powdered sugar, and served the cake with some fresh sliced strawberries.  If you like the light texture of an angel food cake, and the flavor of a rich chocolate brownie, you will LOVE this dessert!!!",
