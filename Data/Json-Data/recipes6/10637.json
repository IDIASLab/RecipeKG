                "reviewBody": "This recipe minus the glaze is a staple I grew up on. When I grew up it took me years to track down the Herman starter again & still after all those years the memory of this coffee cake made my mouth water! Now I make it on a regular basis for my family & more & more friends after they've tried it. It's amazing with the glaze! A few variations I've tried- adding 1-2c. diced apples (dusted in flour & cinnamon) to the batter mixture. I've changed out 1c. flour for whole wheat flour & it only slightly lowered the sweet bite couldn't even tell;-) I also have tried it with raw sugar opposed to the white sugar & it didn't affect the final texture as raw sugar normally does. The topping for this cake is supposed to sink down into the batter as it bakes as that adds the swirls of intense flavor to the cake. I always use a couple toothpicks & swirl the topping into the surface of the batter a bit to even it out more. If your sourdough starter is too runny it will make the final batter wetter all you need to do is add a bit more flour to the batter until it resembles a thick brownie batter or the like. OR if you're already cooking it & realize- just bake it another 5min at a time until the center stops jiggling & you can slide a toothpick out of the center (not in a cinnamon swirl) clean. All in all this recipe is very forgiving & very agreeable to experimenting with variations! It's definitely a favorite around here!!",

It gives it a great appearance without adding a whole lot more fat/sugar and still allows the topping to remain crispy.\n\nOur favorite variations include 3 cups of cut up apples along with the nuts and raisins or a large can of cut up peaches and the nuts.  I also use a little more cinnamon - 2 t.\n\nFor best flavor it is best to make the coffee cake a day ahead.  The flavor becomes more intense as the days pass.\n\nThe secret to success with the Herman starter is to keep it at room temperature and to avoid using metal spoons or bowls.",

We thought it had a bread pudding texture that was not what I expected or wanted. My other comment is that the glaze is complete overkill. It made my favorite feature of coffee cake the crumb topping a mess. It totally obliterated it into a mushy slop that made it seem like it was undercooked. I agree with another reviewer's comments about texture. If you can get past the texture the flavor was good.",
