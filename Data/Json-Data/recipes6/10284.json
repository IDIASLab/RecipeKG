I put all the ingredients into my bread maker...pushed the dough button and in 1 1/2 hours I shaped them put them on a buttered and floured cookie sheet (2) and in 15 minutes we had the softest best tasting rolls...I was amazed!! And very happy. I make Golden Knots (which I have put on allrecipes also!) and they are a sweet roll so I wanted to find a good roll recipe my family would like on the non sweet side and boy here it is...you will not be sorry for trying these...you'll try them over and over again!!
