I literally looked at EVERY Spritz recipe on this site - sidebyside- with a notepad. I then made 3 different recipes that each varied by a significant ingredient or two. I brought the cookies around to kids and neighbors & had them 'vote. Without doubt these were the best!! They are light and delicious DEF with the BEST flavor! They're like Danish cookies but BETTER. (I used 1 c sugar and vanilla instead of almond. You can also tweak the butter and temperature to what works best for you.) This is the Spritz to go with!!!! Enjoy",

My cookie press doesn't allow me to use refrigerated dough because it's motorized so when i realized it wasn't quite firm enough I simply added 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out perfect. People have raved how it isn't too sweet and isn't too chalky (like some other recipes I've tried) and the cookies come out a perfect white. Thanks for the recipe!",
