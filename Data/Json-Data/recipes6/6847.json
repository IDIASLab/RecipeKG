First I used a pot since I feel that stews need to sit and cook slowly for optimal flavor and tenderness. Second since I am not a beer drinker I used about 1 and a half bottles and not the entire 2. To go with the theme of the season I used Samuel Adams October-fest Ale. Second there was something missing from flavor so to jazz it up a bit I added a few beef bullion packets and a 1/2 of cup of Worcestershire sauce - that perfected it for me for flavor. Finally I agree with most of the other posters that it was not thick enough and too soupy so I did thicken it with some cornstarch - that was it! I will make this again but with the additional modifications I did.:)",

I've been looking forward to it allllll day (the aroma has filled my house for hours) and now i'm a bit dissapointed. It's way too sweet. I didn't know how to fix that so I added worchestershire and that made it worce! It's definatley edible but I think where I went wrong was in the deglazing step. I went ahead and added the vinigar and sugar and scrapped the reminants from the meat added some of the broth to that and then dumped the mixture in with everything else into my crockpot. I think in the recipe the sweet mixture should have been absorbed by the veggies as was not the case in my version. ALSO i didn't add all the beer because of the other reviews and the beer i did use i think was to sweet. I think it needs a dark beer.",
