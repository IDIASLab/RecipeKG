I left out the kidney beans and substituted 6 T. ground walnuts for the peanuts and hazelnuts. For mixed spice I used a combination of allspice mace cinnamon nutmeg and cloves. My vegetarian son gave it a definite thumbs up. I will definatly makes this again. Good and healthy and sticks to your ribs.",

We served it as we would meatloaf so it only served 4. It was a little crumbly without the egg but we didn't mind a bit; others may want to use it. Thanks for a great recipe.",

It's quite easy (especially compared to traditional recipes) - no tracking down strange bits of offal which are hard/impossible to find in the States. I was confused about the \"mixed spice\" and didn't even think of the pie spices other people have named so I just ended up using a basil/oregano/sage mix and it was fine. I also subbed pecans for hazelnuts since I had them on hand. One tough spot was that the mixture was too dry already when starting in on the 20 minute simmer so I added water along the way to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pan and drying out. It also didn't set up into a real firm loaf but served as a sort of hash was just fine. What matters is that its delicious. Cheers!",
