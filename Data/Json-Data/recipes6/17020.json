So, I change my rating to 5 stars. Thanks for sharing!",

First time: I substituted 1/4 c. wheat flour (which couldn't be tasted - I might try using 1/2 c.); cut back the butter to 1 stick (might cut back 2 more Tbsp next time); cut the sugar to 3/4 c.; and omitted the nuts (personal preference). I also only used 3/4 cup cherries because that's what I got out of a 10 oz. jar but the boyfriend thought this ended up being the perfect amount of cherries. Second time: Used all white flour (didn't have wheat on hand) same amount of cherries as last time 1 stick butter (forgot to cut back as planned) only 2/3 c. sugar 8 Tbsp cocoa and no nuts. I think next time I will use 3/4 c. sugar and 8 Tbsp cocoa. I also might try adding 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips (although these are great without them). These would also be good sprinkled with powdered sugar. I got 35 cookies using my little cookie scoop (sorry not sure what size it is).",

I will see if this also helps to avoid them spreading which is usually caused by a warm butter or too hot of an oven or even the type of cookie sheet used. Beware that if you use a light colored sheet bake them for 10 minutes. With a dark colored sheet bake them for 8 minutes exactly. You can also lower the oven temperature to 325F if using a dark sheet. I also noticed that removing them from the sheet after about 3 minutes helped a bit to avoid excessive spreading. Anyway, I think this recipe has room for improvement on its texture and outcome. I will try again, but be assured that the taste is very  good. My only actual tweak was that I added 1/4c extra of nuts, because I like them a lot.",
