I will definitely make this again. No changes needed! It comes together quickly and is perfect for a weeknight meal.",

As it cooked, I made the veggies in a non stick pan with some extra mushrooms.  I added some ginger and some chili garlic to the left over sauce that the tofu had soaked in, and added that to the veggies when they were done.  My wife raved, and said it was up there with my best stir fries.  I can't believe we loved a vegetarian meal this much.  I will make this every 2 weeks!",

If you're new to cooking with tofu (like me), one thing the recipe does not mention is that you should press the tofu beforehand to remove the water. I made two changes to the recipe:  I used 2 tablespoons of peanut oil, instead of olive oil.  Instead of squash, I used Chinese eggplant along with the zucchini.  Served it with quinoa. Loved the recipe!",
