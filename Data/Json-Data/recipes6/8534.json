I used 10 Big Jim peppers (medium heat) for the recipe. I made the remainder of the recipe as written. The recipe was easy to follow. Like Christopher I also added two diced potatoes during the last 20 minutes of the cooking phase being we prefer potatoes in our green chili stew. This is a delicious dish and i will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.",
