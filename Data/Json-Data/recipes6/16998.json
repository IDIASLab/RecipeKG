I notice everyone else pointing out that we are supposed to use unsweetened coconut, but I used sweetened because it is what I had, and it was devine.  I wouldn't change anything.  The batter was very thick, so it was hard to spread, and I found that I had to spread it with 2 fingers with a little butter on them- the spatula just was clinging to the batter.  I made them in a 9x9 bar pan and thought the thickness of the layers was absolutely perfect.  These are just great and are definitely staying in my recipe box.  We burned our mouths on them because we couldn't wait till they cooled to taste them, and they were worth it.  They are even better the next day.",

I used the Baker's One Bowl Brownies recipe from the Kraft web-site for my base. Thanks for sharing Valerie.",

It is really thick I think there might be more coconut that brownie! It's a tiny bit dry too I would maybe use 3 or 3.5 cups of coconut next time (and keep the milk the same). That would cut down on the thickness of that layer also. I checked these at 40 minutes and they were done. I think they might have been a bit over-done so I would check at 35 next time. These cut very well and look fancy I love how they turned out. It was really really hard to spread the brownie batter (both times). I used Bob's Red Mill unsweetened coconut and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour. I have been wanting to make these all year and I'm glad I finally had an excuse to make them!
