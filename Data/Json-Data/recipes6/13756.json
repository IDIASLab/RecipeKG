I baked both and this one turned out lighter and better with a lot less work than my other one! I did put it in a water bath like I always do and added ground walnuts and a little sugar to the crust for extra flavor. This is a wonderul and easy recipe. Thanks for posting it is my new favorite cheese cake!",
