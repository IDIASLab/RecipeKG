Fresh vegetables sauteed quickly, mixed with your favorite protein, then placed into a perfectly cooked bell pepper and topped with a light drizzle of unagi sauce. It doesn't really need a side dish, but you could serve it with Chinese-style sticky rice or fried rice, or it would go well with your favorite wonton soup.",
