No need to go out to  get  it now- thanks for sharing  the  recipe.\n\nupdate - made again  added  leftover chicken w/ sliced mushrooms and slice celery  cut  down heat as its is  spicy as written by  adding 1  hot pepper less siracha  and read pepper  flakes -still spicy -- its  a  delicious  recipe !",

As for changes- I will say I couldn't find rice noodles so I just use fettuccine noodles.I also didn't use hoisin because I don't like it... but there was SO much flavor going on I didn't miss it. It was very very spicy because I used my homegrown jalape\u00f1os which are hotter than firecrackers but my family loves the spiciness. It could easily be made less spicy by adjusting the peppers and siracha as desired. We loved it! This recipe is a keeper!",
