I do make a few very minor changes:  I use raspberries instead of grapes (just for personal preference), thawed frozen peaches instead of fresh white ones, and I warm up one of the ingredients in the microwave (usually the lemonade concentrate) to dissolve the sugar into it before adding it to the mix.  Note:  This is VERY good, VERY easy to drink, and VERY intoxicating!  Unless you want everyone at your party drunk after a drink or two, I suggest serving it with 7up or sparkling water (1:1 ratio).  It makes the drink a touch bubbly, takes nothing from the taste, and helps it go down a little slower. ;-)",

Changed the ratio of grapes to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup blueberries for additional color.  Leave overnight in the fridge no longer than 24 hours.  Anything more and your peaches become mush. This Sangria packs a power punch so please be careful...  as other reviewers have suggested, you might want to \"cut\" it with ginger ale or club soda to avoid face first encounters with the floor.

I used a bag of frozen peaches (1 lbs), 1 cup of red seedless grapes (because to me they are oh so much better than green grapes), and about 1 - 1 1/2 cups strawberries. I refrigerated it for 12 hours or longer. With the left over fruit I decided to freeze it and use it for ice cubes in the glasses next time I make these and yes there will be a next time. I do think I will add about three kiwis next time as well. That will be beautiful. This drink would be great for a pool party. Enjoy! WOW!",
