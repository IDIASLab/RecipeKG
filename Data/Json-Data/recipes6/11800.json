I followed the recipe exactly aside from adding 1 tsp cinnamon. The dough tasted delicious; the cookies were very promising before they went in the oven. After about 7 minutes I checked on the first batch because they smelled done. They were. Not only were they done and quite dark brown but the cookies had all spread and made one gigantic extremely thin cookie conglomerate that covered the baking sheet. Not impressed. I put teaspoon fulls of dough on the tray 2 inches apart as indicated in the recipe. Doing this on two baking trays only used up about half the dough though so the yield is off (would be 48 rather than 24 if only teaspoonfuls of dough are used).",
