                "reviewBody": "I hate to give a bad review, but I had serious issues in making this recipe. Overall, potatoes cooked perfectly and flavor is good, but texture was more of a gluey consistency (used potato masher and fork). I only used 1 tsp salt and didn\u2019t feel the need to add additional salt after mixing. The major issue with this recipe is that there is too much liquid to make mashed potatoes in the Instant Pot (IP)! You will only need 1 to 2 cups total broth according to other tried and true Instant Pot recipes such as the IP recipe book, Amy+Jacky, and This Old Gal. I\u2019m a newer IP user and while I have successfully made potatoes in the IP before (for potato salad and Fioa\u2019s scalloped potatoes), but wasn\u2019t thinking clearly and added the entire 4 cups of liquid. What a mess when doing the quick release (spewing liquid like a volcano)! The next issue is wasting broth if you use 4 cups because you\u2019re straining the potatoes and not reserving any of the broth. Good thing I used Vegan and Gluten Free Broth Powder (from this site) to make the vegetable broth. I reserved about 1/2 cup of the liquid to use a little in mashing the potatoes as my husband always does when he makes his mashed potatoes. So, if you want to try this recipe, try with 1.5 cups of broth, either use the natural release method for 5-10 minutes and then quick-release, or do the quick release in short bursts to ensure volcano eruption doesn\u2019t occur. I\u2019d have to try it again with 1.5 cups. Sorry, this just didn't work for us.",
