Of course this made the actual shaping of the cookies very difficult! I ended up only making four because it was so hard and putting the leftover dough (or should I say crumbles?) into the fridge for my family to eat. The spiders themselves once baked were pretty cute but they were very hard and brittle. Several legs broke off in the process of moving the spiders even though I let them cool as the recipe suggested. A few of the legs burned before the rest of the cookie was baked as well. My siblings said they tasted okay but not great. Sorry but I will not be making these again!",
