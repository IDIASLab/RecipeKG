I followed the instructions completely before cutting into it and the dough on the bottom was completely raw. I nuked it for an additional 3 minutes and allowed to rest again. They were done. Texture wise it was not the same as baking...which gives a bit more of a crunch. I could see that you could easily OVER microwave these and then end up with a solid brick....watch your timing!",

This is one of the recipes I used to introduce cooking and it was well loved by thousands of students in my classroom.  Cooking time can vary based on your microwave wattage.  Our classroom models were all 1000 watts or higher.  if yours is lower it may take longer to cook.  The outside edges should look done and the center slightly moist.  Make sure you are using a shallow dish or silicone tube pan as suggested for good results.  Happy Cooking!",
