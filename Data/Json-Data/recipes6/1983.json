Both in terms of ease and quality.  \n\nReduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup per many suggestions, and I think this was fine, although I suspect it would have been just fine as originally directed.  \n\nI also substituted a flat iron steak for the flank steak because the flanks were all two pounds or more.  I've grilled flatirons quite a bit and knew they would be similar, plus they were cheaper.  \n\nI cut the steak into strips before the cornstarch step.  This gave more surface area to be coated with the cornstarch, although I am not sure why it is even necessary to coat the meat as the marinade surely washed it off.  It probably could just be whisked into the soy mixture at the beginning.  But I followed instructions except used a gallon zip lock back to shake the beef for coating.  I marinated in the same bag I used to shake it up with the cornstarch.  The whole concoction fit easily in my 2.5Q slow cooker.  (I wish all slow cooker recipes would tell you what size you need.  Sometimes I guess too small and wind up having to transfer to a bigger slow cooker, and nothing aggravates me more than dirtying up dish for no good reason and then having to wash it.) \n\nI checked it at about 2:30 and it was not tender.   But by 2:45 some marvelous chemical or thermodynamic reaction had taken place and it was just perfectly tender and flavorful.  Served on jasmine rice.",

Other than that, it is a GREAT weeknight meal when served with Jasmine rice (w/ a little sesame oil and salt added when cooking) and roasted broccoli florets (mixed w/ a little sesame oil and salt and then roasted at 400 for roughly 10 minutes).",
