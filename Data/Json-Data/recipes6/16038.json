The flavor is only intense butter and sweetness. I even followed other users' good suggestions and used half the amount of butter and extra pineapple. If I try it again, I would double or more the pineapple, add vanilla flavoring, cinnamon and maybe even a touch of cloves.    Substitution for self-rising flour: If you don't have it you can just use regular flour and add 1 & 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt to regular flour.  ",

What a great idea!  I had some pineapple and cherries left from Christmas ham and needed to get them out of the fridge, so was looking for a recipe.  I followed this closley but made a couple of adjustments:  Used 1 cup of brown sugar and combined it with the melted butter in the pan.  Then I laid-out cherries and pineapple as for 'regular' upside-down cake.  Then I poured the batter on top and baked as directed.  Turned-out just right and tastes very good.  Thanks for the helpful recipe.  For those that had trouble:  This particluar recipe, while easy, is very sensitive to pan-size and oven temp.  Time and temp MUST be adjusted if the pan is different than 9x13.",
