My mom taught me the recipe this year.  Now I am the designated person in our family to make the Fig Cookies.  This is a very high honor.  So they must be as good as my Grandmothers' cookies.  Some call them Homemade Fig Newtons.  They are a tradition at Christmas and are wonderful with a hot cup of coffee.  They are lot of work.  I make them in stages.  First the dough, then a few days later the figs, and finally I will make the cookies.  The dough and the figs keep well in the refrigerator and the cookies freeze very well.",

Almost all Americans with grandparents from Sicily are thoroughly familiar with this fig cookie. In the dialect of my paternal grandparents these cookies were known as \"uccidati\". In Italian they are normally called \"cuccidati\". Some use the word \"buccellati\" A plethora of recipes for Italian fig cookies can be found by googling  \"cuccidati cookies\" and \"buccellati cookies\". My wife of Scotch-Irish heritage went out of her way to master the baking of cuccidati each Christmas - she soon realized how much I considered them to be a part of my traditional Christmas. ",

I made a quarter-batch and it produced 41 cookies that were probably twice the size of Fig Newtons.  In order for a full batch to make the estimated 4-5 dozen cookies, they would need to be probably four times the size of Fig Newtons.  Maybe that's what you're going for, but I think that's a mammoth wad of fig goo.  I also think the dough-to-filling ratio is a bit off.  I would probably use 2/3 as much filling next time.  Still, this recipe was spot-on in terms of making tasty fig-filled cookies.  The raisins and apple add a nice sweetness to the dried figs without interfering with the flavor.  Be careful not to overdo the orange.",

The only complaint I have though is that the dough definitely has a shortening flavor to it that I can't really get used to.  Perhaps I'm just a purist in these situations, but I still think that using real butter in baked items such as these is still the best way to go...and somebody has yet to prove to me otherwise!  I think I will try making these cookies again using butter instead of shortening to see how it turns out.",

I used non salted butter in place of shortening. But if you use butter remember to put the dough in the refrigerator for at least an hour so the butter sets up and you can roll out the dough easier. Also be careful about using the full recipe becasue it makes a lot of cookies. I used 1/3 of the recipe for the filling and 1/4 of it for the dough. It made about 18 cookies. I made some cookies with the left over dough and put vanilla icing and sprinkles on them. Very tasty with coffee.",
