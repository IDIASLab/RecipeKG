My favourite recipe from this site so far. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well I had to change a few things... I halved the sugar and replaced half the ground almonds with raisins and chopped walnuts. And I didn't ice it. With those adjuctments it was definately full marks but as I had to make those changes myself I felt I could only give it a four. Anyway definately try this recipe! I promise it's well worth it!",
