Take the foil off 5 min. before the pies come out of the oven, they're beautiful!!",

Still didn't use the zest still didn't dust cookies (I think they're sweet enough as-is). Did however use butter instead of my usual low fat margarine this time. Used too much butter in fact closer to a half cup than so almost 2 tbsp over. The result was a cookie that wanted to be more like shortbread which I certainly had no problems with. Doubled the cardamom this time and did a couple shakeashakes extra of cinnamon and I think these are pretty much the perfect tea cookie. A very 'adult' cookie as someone else said. Lastly extra butter helped the stickiness in my dough SUBSTANTIALLY and I chilled in the fridge for an hour while watching TV:) Normally I reserve 3 stars for recipes that were fine but not something I'd make again--this time it's just due to the number of changes I've made.",

I also found the dough too sticky too roll so I made balls and flattened them with my hand - note that this will decrease the yield to 1.5 dozen. I sprinkled pecans on top too and am enjoying the cookies very much!",
