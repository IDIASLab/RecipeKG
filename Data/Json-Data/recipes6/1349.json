I had a 20oz. can of pineapple rings that I was using with this recipe.  I drained the pineapple and saved the juice.  The juiced equaled 3/4 cup, so my first concern was one cake mix having 2 1/4 cups of liquid with the water, oil and juice.  I used it anyways, and the cupcakes baked up fine.  My muffin tins aren't huge, and I got 38 cupcakes from this recipe, a lot more than the 12 the recipe states!  Because I got so many cupcakes from this recipe, I had to make a batch and a half of the brown sugar/butter combination.  I made 24 with dark brown sugar and 14 with light brown sugar.  The recipe does not tell you when to flip the cupcakes out of the pan.  WAIT for 5 minutes before flipping.  This gives the butter mixture time to set up.  It will make a mess, so make sure you have a cookie sheet or newspapers under the cooling rack when you flip them.  The taste is wonderful, and we actually prefer the ones made with the dark brown sugar.",

                "reviewBody": "First, I don't have a clue where you'd find a 12.5 oz can of pineapple (it's 8 or 20 oz in my area).  I used a 20-oz can, and measured out 12.5 oz.  Second, there's almost too much of everything for 12 cupcakes.  I filled the muffin cups up to the top (trying to use all of the batter) which made them dome too much, and I still had enough batter left for another 2-3 cupcakes.  The topping overflowed/oozed out of the muffin cup spilling onto the bottom of the oven, baking on to the top of the muffin pan, and leaving a mess to clean up.  I left the cupcakes cool completely (recipe doesn't tell you what to do), put a large cutting board on top of the muffin pan, and then flipped it over.  If I were to make again, I think I'd try an 8-oz can of pineapple tidbits, 2/3 cup of brown sugar, and about 5 Tbsp of butter.  That way the muffin cup would be less full leaving room for more cake batter and,  hopefully, using up all of it.  I'm giving this 4 stars because in spite of these things, they were moist and full of flavor, but some tweaking is necessary to make this a 5 star recipe.",
