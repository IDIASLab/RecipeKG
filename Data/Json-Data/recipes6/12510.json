I agree with another reviewer that the uncooked dough was really fantastic but when you cook it it dosen't taste as good. Sounds bizarre but it's true. This makes a ton way more than 12 servings unless each person has four or five cookies. 375 for ten minutes was just right. This would be GREAT with white chocolate chips and craisins. NOTE: I did use fat free cream cheese but I think that was kind of like putting the cart before the horse if you really think about it.",
