The clean up was even faster. Then came the rolling cutting painting sprinkling & baking - We have done cut out cookies before and what a chore all fun was lost but this cookie dough was the easiest cookie dough I have EVER worked with. It rolled out so nice I was amazed. Out cut outs actually held together too! The painting and sprinkles were the highlight of this recipe for the girls. Towards the end my 3 year old grandson came over and he too got involved painting. Things looks like so much fun before I knew it my daughter-in-law had joined in with the children painting too. We have some very \"BEAUTIFUL\" hand-painted one or a kind cookies that only a grandma could be proud of but oh how I could go on. The cookie itself baked up wonderful and of course we made them for Santa but you know we had to sample a few on the way to make sure they were his favorite kind. Well even Santa's gonna love these cookies and even more so knowing they were specially made for him with such great pride by the children. Thank you Ms. Robin J. for the wonderful afternoon your recipe allowed me to share with my grandchildren the day has been priceless. I recommend this recipe for anyone espically for grandma's and not only grandaughters but even grandma's and grandsons. This recipe has now made it into our families traditional",

                "reviewBody": "Thank goodness I found this recipe again I searched the entire sugar cookie recipes for it! I moved couldn't find my print out and couldn't seem to remember the name. I used this recipe last Christmas for the first time. These cookies turned out AWESOME! They held the cut-out shape better than any recipe I've ever used! My cookies were the best looking ones out of the bunch that was brought for the kids to decorate and I had several nice comments from the other moms. I thought the cookie tasted great. I was a little dubious using the powdered sugar but was pleasantly surprised! It has a light flavor and soft texture. I think if you're looking for a cookie for more flavor then maybe a more eggy recipe will be what you are looking for. If you want a recipe for cut-outs that is super then this is the one you want or try adding almond extract or icing them. I also made these for my kids at home and they had a blast painting the cookies. I was worried about using raw egg yolk but when baked it is safe to eat and store. The colors are awesome! They are so bright and make beautiful colors. Just make sure the kids rinse their brushes before changing colors. The more colors you use the better. I am thinking of using this at Valentines for a large heart cookie for the teacher and at Easter with some beautiful Easter colors. Thanks Robin for saving the day with your awesome cookie recipe! I am making sure to put it in my recipe box so I won't ever lose it again!",
