Instead of processing blanched almonds I used Trader Joe's pure almond flour 3 cups of it. B/c they weren't blanched there were bits of brown skin so it didn't turn out the smooth beige coloring in the picture. It was a little bit grainy/speckled and the dough was really sticky for me so I couldn't get rounded balls they ended up looking more like coconut macroons. The flavor was really great and I even cut down the sugar to 1 cup. I think if I use the almond flour again I might mix a little bit of regular flour in just to make the texture smoother. Also I used a 1/2 tablespoon to make the cookies which made 2 dozen but I think it made them too big and \"dense.\" Next time I will make them smaller I think 1 teaspoon would be perfect. I'm still looking for a recipe similar to the AMAZING amaretti I had in Venice Italy!! Flavor was there but texture was not what I was looking for but it was probably the adjustments I made. If you like the texture of coconut macroons then this is it but almond flavored!",

I only gave it four stars because the oven times were really off for me. It took closer to an hour for a batch to start to brown. If you want chewy cookies that stay chewy use rounded balls and do NOT flatten them as they are in some of the photos. I made a batch of rounded balls and one with flatter cookies and a day later the flatter ones are really hard -- great for dunking in coffee or tea but not for eating solo. The rounded ones are still nice and chewy on the inside -- perfect! The substitution I made was to use a 16 oz. bag of Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour instead of grinding slivered almonds. I may use less almond flour next time as I like my amaretti a little sweeter than these came out.",
