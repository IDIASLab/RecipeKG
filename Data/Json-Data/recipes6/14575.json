Nice & fully w/ a great taste! This is a quality muffin recipe - I'll be sure to make it again!",

We had a surplus of hazelnuts and this recipe is a perfect way to use them up. They are best when fresh though. I baked some of the batter up as a loaf but it does not hold the shape very well and crumbles. I also tried to freeze the baked muffins and this recipe does not freeze very well. Oh well I guess there are worse things than having to eat these freshly baked!",

The only fruit I had on hand were frozen peaches (so I omitted the apples cranberries figs and hazelnuts). I also substituted cloves for ginger and margarine for butter then put a vanilla/cinnamon sugar mix on top. However everyone who tasted these muffins said they were the best thing I have ever made by far...they are very critical and said they wouldn't change a thing! The bottom line: this is a great base recipe which tastes great despite substitutions...everyone appreciated the complex well-blended flavors.:-)",
