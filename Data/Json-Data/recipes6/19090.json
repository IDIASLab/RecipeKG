I didn't have a wok but found that using a large, non-stick pot worked well.  I substituted sesame oil for the vegetable oil but used the same quantity.  I used one medium onion (diced), two seemed like an awful lot.  I used a cup of tomatoe puree and, next time, I'd probably add a 1 1/2 or 2 cups of peas instead of just one.  The garlic/ginger paste is a little hard to find so I substituted a finely minced concoction of a few small cloves of fresh garlic and an equal quantity of fresh ginger.  The spice Garam masala is now available from the spice company McCormick and is sold at large supermarkets in my area (Giant Food in No. VA).  The amount of paprika specified was to my liking (but I'm a paprika fan).  Give this dish a try, you won't be disappointed!",

Rather than sugar I used about a tsp. each of cinnamon and cloves and rather than paprika I used curry and chili powder to spice it up a bit. To reduce fat I only used about a tsp. of oil and that worked just fine. Using crused or diced tomatoes rather than puree adds some moisture to the sauce to pour over rice or dip Naan into.",

I used chopped garlic and ginger worked fine. I pre-cooked the potatoes in a large pot with garlic salt and pepper. And sauteed the onions/garlic separately then mixed together when the potatoes were about done (about 20 mins). I also used a small can of tomato paste and topped it off with some V8 juice (about 2 cups)... it made it nice and creamy. Added fresh tomatoes and lots of peas... some dried chili flakes.
