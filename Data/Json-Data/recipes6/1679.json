The bread cubes do a nice job on thickening the soup, and I used my immersion blender instead of processing in a blender.   Made for lunch today and was quite happy with the flavor that came from canned tomatoes rather than making it totally from scratch.  Tomato soup has been one of my favs since childhood, and I'll be making this one again.  Thanks geode for a nice new recipe.",

I had fresh Beefsteak tomatoes from my garden so I used those. I used my Vitamix blender and pureed the onions garlic and tomatoes after lengthy simmering. Vegetable Broth was used since my daughter is vegetarian (I cut the amount in half) and since I had no bread I used smoked gouda Triscuits; they worked great. I added them after pureeing and they blended right in with no mashing. Rich creamy yes even decadent-tasting soup especially for something so healthy with the added plus of the whole -grain Triscuits. Wonderful soup!",
