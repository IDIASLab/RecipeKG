I also since I thought the number of serving sizes (4) was too small for my purpose and had a 12 point something ounce package of silken tofu made 50% more by multiplying all the cake ingredients besides the crust the topping or the lemon zest and juice by 1.5 times the amount listed. Almost all of it still fit in the 8 inch glass pie pan I used and it made bigger servings. I did NOT increase the amount of lemon zest or lemon juice however. I kept the lemon zest the same (1 Tbsp.) and actually LOWERED the lemon juice to juice of ONE lemon. My 1.5x version made about 8 or 9 servings though so I think the regular recipe really makes about 6. I also added the vegan all-natural Earth Balance margarine substitute to the crust but still had problems with it -- there was two much of it and it held together but could have been more solid. Also it needed more flavor IMO -- I plan to experiment with other pie crusts. Given all the changes I'm making why am I still giving it five stars? Because the texture and basic flavor alone are worth at least five stars -- this recipe came out INCREDIBLY cheesecake-like and was the most authentic tasting and feeling vegan cheesecake I've had. I think AllRecipes should list it in the regular cheescake files too -- most meat eaters would love it. It's a little less heavy th",

The only difference I noticed compared to non-vegan cheesecake is that this one is rich but not too rich--it doesn't sit really heavy in your tummy which is a good thing! My friend is vegan and I made it for her birthday party--I got tons of compliments even from the non-vegans. I tripled the recipe and it fit perfectly in my 9-inch springform pan. I used only 1 lemon and added 1.5T vanilla -- baked for 30 min @ 350 deg. reduced heat to 325 and baked for approx. another hour until the internal temperature of the cheesecake was 165 degrees. Turned off the oven and left it in there with the door closed for another hour and then chilled it for 4 hours (1 hr of that was in the freezer since I was short on time). Finished it off with a homemade blueberry topping--it looked beautiful and was eaten in less than 5 minutes!! THANK YOU for this WONDERFUL recipe:)",

I used the juice of one lemon and even that was too much. Next time I will use the juice of one half of a lemon. I found it very difficult to get the crust into the pie pan. It was too sticky -- stuck to my hands rather than the pie tin. Eventually I tried greasing my hands with a little vegetable oil and that helped. Next time I may use margarine instead of maple syrup. Otherwise it was a great dessert and I will definitely make it again!",
