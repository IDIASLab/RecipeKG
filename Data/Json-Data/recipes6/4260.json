A version of this casserole was included. Instead of  beef broth it called for a cup of water and a cup of frozen peas. As a very young, inexperienced cook this turned into one of our go-to favorite meals even after my culinary skills and repertoire improved. After my daughter was born and was old enough to ask for specific foods this was also one of her favorite dishes. Up until she was a teenager, when asked what she wanted for her birthday dinner she would always asked for 'Casserole' even though she had the option of any home cooked meal or restaurant in town. In the early days this would very often be our 'day before payday' meal as I could go to the store with $5 and come home with all the makings for a complete meal. LOL!",

I know I\u2019ve made my own \u201chot dishes\u201d over the years, and I never thought about cooking the macaroni right in the skillet...saved one dirty pan to wash!  It did get a little thick once the mac was cooked, so I added some extra beef broth, but this certainly was quick and easy.  Also, I think this is one of those recipes that you just have to adjust the seaonings to your taste preferences.  I was looking for a little something different, so I did add more soy sauce and felt it needed more of a kick, so more hot sauce as well.  Not sure that I\u2019d make again, but it was OK.",
