I tried it again and used fat free half and half and it was again, incredible.  I honestly could not even tell it was made without the cream.  (I used about 3/4 cup of half and half instead of the full cup since it is thinner than cream.)  My hubby said it was better than anything you can buy from the store.  The fat is incredibly low with only that from the butter.  Try it with the FF half and half--you might be surprised!  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares on hand so I mixed 12 tablespoons of premium unsweetened cocoa powder with four tablespoons of canola oil and then prepared the rest of the recipe as written. Outstanding!! Never again will there be store-bought chocolate sauce in this house. I can't wait to try this with ice cream cakes and as a topping for brownies. My search for a truly delicious, rich chocolate sauce is now over. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
