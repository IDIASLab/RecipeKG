I baked it into big rectangular corning ware dish (about 16\" x 9). I added a touch of almond extract. It gives it a nice taste. When baked, I topped it with a touch of icing sugar. It looked great. DO NOT over cook. I baked them for 30-35 minutes. These squares are better when they are moist. Do as the recipe says. Do not use a toothpick to judge if bake or not as it will come out as if it was not baked. Hope this help!",

I also used less brown sugar than it called for (because I ran out) and substituted with extra white sugar, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. It turned out great! The only thing I would do differently--if doubling the recipe in one pan again, I wouldn't double the cinnamon sugar topping because there was way too much. I used it all and when the bars were picked up, tons fell off---mostly sugar, leaving a VERY strong cinnamon taste, probably more than many people would want.",

I doubled the recipe (but I cut down BOTH sugars to approx. 3/4c each) and increased the apples to 2 large chopped apples (just over 2c).  Left out the nuts.  The bars were still sweet enough and don't require any frosting (although the caramel drizzle one reviewer suggested would be delish).  Did not double the cinn/sugar topping.  Baked in 9x13 pan for 33 minutes.  My daughter said to save this recipe and we'll definitely make again soon!",

Five stars, he said, and better than his all-time favorite butterscotch cookies. Wow! I used Granny Smith apple, left out the nuts at his request and glazed them (right on top of the cinnamon sugar topping) with a butterscotch glaze I kind of just threw together as an experiment: 2 T. each of butter, brown sugar and cream, boiled for a couple of minutes, added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla, then more cream and powdered sugar till desired consistency.  These are chewy, subtley cinnamony and appley with a butterscotch finish (his words, not mine). Definitely a make again!",

The first time, I used 1 cup of apples but the next time, I used 1 1/2 full apples and I liked it better with more apples.  With more apples, the squares are more moist and cakey.  I also made a batch in a 9x13 pan -- I doubled the recipe, used 3/4 cup of each sugar, used 2 1/2 full apples, and baked for 33 minutes.  No need to double the sugar topping.  Delicious!

Second batch was  5 stars, here's what i did: I doubled most of the ingredients and used 5 nice size apples (about 2 1/2 cups) and added 1/2 cup apple juice.  I also cut down on the sugar, using just 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white.  It turned out less sugary, moist and delicious!

For the sugar I used only 1 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup white sugar and it was plenty sweet. Next time I think I'll add about 1/2 cup apple juice for more apple flavor and tang. I will also use Granny Smith and double the apples. I used a braeburn apple this time and the flavor was too flat. I doubled the recipe but still used a 9x9 dish and baked exactly 40 min. Like a gooey coffee cake. Just make sure to cool completely before cutting since the cake is so moist. Will make again. (I gave only 4 star since it wasn't 100% perfect. Doubling the apples is a must!)",

Also I didn't like the topping it just fell off. I could not cut these into neat squares as they fell apart and would not hold any shape. Im sorry that these did not turn out for me.",
