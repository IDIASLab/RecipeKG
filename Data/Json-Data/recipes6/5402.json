Maybe GF breads differ, but I used the Schar brand and it took 20-25 minutes to toast the bread cubes. The first time I made the recipe as written and it was a soupy and soggy mess. To save it I had to bake it. The second time around I used less stock (1 1/4 cup and thought it needed more so added about another 1/4 cup and then it was a bit too moist and again I would bake it). Next time I would cook the veggies as directed, stir that into the toasted bread cubes, slowly add the vegetable stock until cubes are moist, and bake for a little bit adding additional liquid if needed. I'll make this again, but with some tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!",

I\u2019m going to try cooking it in the bird next time.  I did not have any broth or stock, so I used water instead.  It still has plenty of flavor!   Thank you for this recipe.",
