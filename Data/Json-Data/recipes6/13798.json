I also added a half cup of freshly shredded carrot and a half cup of organic raisins. One of the moistest bar recipes I've ever made and the flavor is really fantastic. I was worried that a halved recipe of the frosting wouldn't be enough but it was a very thin layer that didn't overpower the flavor of the carrot bars. Very VERY good.",

What a Godsend to forego the grating of fresh carrots scraping one's knuckles et cetera. I top with classic cream cheese icing. A pecan half atop each carrot bar makes a lovely professional looking garnish. Merci beaucoups Kathy!",
