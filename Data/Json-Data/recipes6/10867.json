Add sour cream and flour mixture alternately, beginning and ending with flour. To avoid a crusty, over-baked exterior bake at standard 350 degrees. Also, for a moist cake, do not overbake! This cake is very similar to one made with a yellow cake mix, but a much tastier choice. I omitted the nuts and used brown sugar for the filling--no need at all to double filling ingredients--then  drizzled with a powdered sugar glaze when cool. Excellent recipe!",

If you add the vanilla at the same time you add the butter, you get a more intense vanilla flavor.  I also added about a 1 teaspoon more cinnamon and added the nuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture rather than have them throughout the whole cake.  Definitely make it again but will use the standard mixing method - cream butter and sugars, add sour cream and eggs, etc.  Also I didn't use the 400 degree temp - just the 350 and baked it until it was done.",
