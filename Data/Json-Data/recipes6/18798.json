Who knew the combination of ingredients (chicken bouillon?!? with pickled beets?) in the dressing could result in such a tasty vinaigrette. I made a few changes to the salad part because all I had was feta and blue cheese....hubby had the feta and I had the blue cheese....we liked both! I also didn't caramelize my walnuts---didn't want the added sugar. Again thought the raw walnuts where just as good.
