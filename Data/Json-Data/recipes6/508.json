Besides, I've made \"from scratch\" baked beans that were simply awful. I added chopped onion and green pepper and cut waaaaay back on the brown sugar to about one-third the amount called for (good call on that one, at least for Hubs and me). But having doctored up a can or two of pork 'n' beans in my lifetime I've got to say it has to be the barbecue sauce (and green pepper) that gives these beans their mark of distinction. Such great flavor! These are too good to be this easy.",
