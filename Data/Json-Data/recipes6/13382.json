The directions in the recipe do not say to pour the contents of the bowl with the peaches over the \"dough\", it says to spoon the peaches over the dough.  Therefore, do not pour all the liquid from that bowl onto your dough...otherwise it will get sloppy.  When you \"spoon\" something up, you are suppose to leave the liquid behind.  This is a perfect tasting cobbler.",

First, I added more than a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the peach mixture-about 1/4 teaspoon of each. Next, I also added about 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the mixtue. To combat the extra juiciness, I replaced the cornstarch with 6 tablespoons of flour. Then, I scooped out approximately 1/2 cup of the peach mixture liquid. Another key  is allowing the cobbler to \"set\" after it comes out of the oven. Just let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the juices to thicken. DELICIOUS!",

Having just been to our local market, I had a nice fresh basket of peaches and some wild blueberries on hand. I whipped this together in no time. In this recipe I did not add any butter to the fruit mix, only the melted butter in the baking pan. I used 4 fresh peaches and about 1 cup of blueberries. After reading previous reviews, I decided to only use 1/4 cup of water. I also used whole wheat instead of all purpose flour. Cooking time for me was only 45 minutes. The result? Yummy, moist, everybody raved!  Personally, I wasn't keen on the whole wheat flour, and I like my cobbler quite cakey, so I'd double the batter next time.  Definitely a big thumbs up here! I will make it again.  Give it a try!",

Eliminated salt in batter and added 1-tsp. vanilla.  Reduced size of pan to 8\"x11\" glass and baked for 45-minutes.  Allowed it to set for 1-hour before serving.

For the person who used 10 year old Baking powder you can replace it with...1 teaspoon of baking powder = 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar plus 1/4 teaspoon Baking soda. The only thing I would change on this recipe is to double the batter....I perfer more of the cake part of it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!",
