It seems like all my Swedish relatives think that a recipe should have lots of cream and butter to make it delicious. Maybe not so great for your arteries but once in a while who cares? I remember my Mor Mor making similar cookies for her Christmas Eve smorgasboard. The only thing I would suggest is keeping the cookies chilled until right before serving. They are still wonderful but don't crumble as much as when they are at room temperature. If you are worried about using a raw egg you can get pasturized eggs at the supermarket or if you are still worried leave that ingredient out. These cookies also freeze very well so you can make them well in advance of when they will be eaten. So delicious!",

Ours uses light cream instead of heavy, which I couldnt even find on the west coast (light cream is abundant here in the NE).  They take a little labor, but its well worth it.  People will pause after the first bite and be overcome with how great they are.  I roll them thinner than the photos are showing, and use a napkin ring as my cookie cutter.  Grandma used a shot-glass :-)  I agree with the other ratings, don't be afraid of the egg-yolk and definitely check it at 7 minutes.  They should be just getting golden on the edges but overbake quickly.  I also double the filling for perfect proportions.  Detyails on the recipe -- chill the dough in thirds in flat disks.  Take each disk out and leave at room temp for 10-15 minutes, then roll with just a bit of flour on surface and rolling pin.  I rolled them this year directly on my granite counters and it worked great.  I only prick the cookies with the fork twice and they don't puff up too big.  Make them once and you will be a convert -- if Christmas is too much then make them for Easter and color them with pastels!",
