Followed recipe to a T and it came out so tender it fell apart. I haven't really cooked a lot in my pressure cooker but found this to be so easy. Hubby said it was little too sweet so maybe I will cut back on the sugar. But I thought it was perfect. Update** A little trick I learned, have a second burner waiting heated to desired cooking temp and move the cooker to that burner after pressure is reached. Cook according to the timing directions. This helps to prevent burning. Thanks",

I used 1 package of frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs from Costco (I did cut the sugar to 1/2 c); I cooked it for 30 minutes in the pressure cooker.
