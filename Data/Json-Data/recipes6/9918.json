There's no way that 2 cups of water is going to disolve/absorb into the chops in 20 minutes. I gave it 30 minutes and the chops went from nice and crisp to soggy...and dry on the inside. If I made these again I think I'd take the chops out of the pan after cooking, make the gravy and then maybe put the chops in the gravy to finish cooking. Or, just cook them through in the beginning and top them with the gravy on the dinner plate.",

Used 1/4 cup with dissolved chicken bullion cube and taste was great. Idea was good but directions need fine tuning. Thanks for the recipe- I would do it again with the adjustments made!!!",
