I am always on the lookout for easy recipes that can replace the mixes available at the grocery store (too many chemicals and msg in most of them for me). This one fit the bill!",

As far as the rest of the recipe I followed it exactly. I served with cheese enchiladas and a red chile sauce",

Update: The second time I made this it came out really dry. I switched recipes and the only difference between them is the tomato paste versus tomato sauce. I like the tomato sauce WAY better.
