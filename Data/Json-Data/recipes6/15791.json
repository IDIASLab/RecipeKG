I've been canning pickles for over 30 years and wanted a new recipe, I tried this one and if you are a beginner or a pro and you want a great recipe then you should try this one!  I made 30 pints in July 2009 and gave them as gifts, as well as ate them, they were a hit.  They were too salty after much rinsing so I cut back the salt to about half after the first batch.  I started making double the recipe.  I mixed them in a large cooler to have enough room to blend everything real well.  I added 2 red and 2 orange peppers to the recipe to give it color and just chopped it instead of diced because the peppers are just as good to eat.  I put ice on the top while the mix stands so the cukes and peppers get crisp.  The cooler helps keep the ice from melting too fast.  I packed the pint jars with the cukes then ladled in the brine, this works fine.  I put them in a 10 minute 'bath' since I made so many and wanted them to last.  I opened the last jar a few weeks ago and it is just as fresh as when I made them last year.  I just finished making 45 pints today.  They're ready to eat right away.  Fantastic pickles!  Thank you, David.  Another pickle tidbit: when storing pickles, turn them upside down, so that the top pickles are soaking in the brine, since the pickles will rise.  Then as you eat them the bottom soaks.",

My husband who is not usually a fan of b&b likes these almost as much as dills now.  :)  I made mine in lengthwise slices so that they could be used along with the onions and bell peppers as sandwich dressings.  Some things that I wanted to touch on that will clear up some of the confusion about the recipe, you MUST save the juices that come out of the cucumbers when soaking in salt and you cannot reduce the amount of salt because what you are doing is creating a balanced brine.  If the brine is not the correct volume of salt/sugar/vinegar and water they will not cure or be safe for canning.  The reason that some are finding the recipe too salty is that it is CRITICAL to use canning salt.  Canning salt has a different volume per measure than table salt or any other.  So you if you use the recommended measure in table salt instead, you are adding WAY more than you need.  I did hot water bath can my pickles, you can find the instructions for how long on pick your own.com  How long you do it for depends on your size jar and altitude.  Hope that helps someone!",
