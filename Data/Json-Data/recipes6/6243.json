Best flavor and always super tender and moist. I read most of the reviews and I see that everyone seems to be having the same problem. No ones glaze seems to thicken. I have always made more glaze than called for. I use about half when I first put the ham in the oven. I put the rest in a large pyrex measuring cup and allow to cool on the counter while the ham cooks. It DOES thicken as it sits and cools. And it WILL glaze the ham if you just continue to baste it about every 20-30 minutes. But overall it is an amazing recipe and I had never made a ham before in my life and my first one was the best!",

I'm sure the glaze as is would have been fabulous but I had to modify it due to ingredients on hand. I put my pineapple slices and cherries on the ham then poured some of the glaze over all before covering tightly with foil and baking at 250 degrees for 2 hours. I then raised the oven temperature to 425 and added more glaze and put the ham back in the oven uncovered for another 10 minutes. It came out moist and delicious. Best tasting ham I've ever made. Note: These are the changes I made in the glaze (which did not thicken like a regular glaze). I used 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves along with the pineapple juice brown sugar and honey. Instead of juiced oranges I used 1/2 cup full pulp orange juice (which may have been a little too much...I'll try 1/3 cup next time). Since I still had leftover glaze in my saucepan even after serving it with the sliced ham I've used the rest as a sweetner for my hot tea and stir it with a cinnamon stick. It makes a great spiced tea!",
