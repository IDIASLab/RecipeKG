I added a tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture for some extra flavor. I had no problem mixing it up even with the cream cheese right from the fridge. It's important to cook this in a preheated oven (I did it in a glass pan 350 degrees.) It was done when the toothpick came out clean and the top started to brown a bit. As an added touch I put chocolate chips on the top while it cooled. Don't try to cut it up until it is completely cooled. Wonderful quick easy recipe. Thanks Nat!",

                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS:  Unless you double the brownie mix, you really will have a flat/extremely thin brownie.  I posted 2 pictures showing the thickness of the entire batch (2 boxes) to give some an idea.  With two, they turn out the correct thickness for a brownie IMO.  Just make 1 box, put it ALL in pan, then put cream cheese mixture, and top with another brownie box mix.  Fits a 9X13 perfectly w/o even reaching near the top!  Definitely line your 9X13 with parchment or foil (w/pam), so you can easily pull out the entire brownie w/o any crumbles.  Also a must to wait for it to completely cool before doing or you will not have nice squares.  I baked mine for 50-55 minutes (until toothpick came out clear), and it came out perfect.  I also took the advice of adding 1T of flour, 3T of butter to the cream cheese (which I took straight out of the fridge before mixing).  If you're a frosting person, adding frosting and then crumbled oreos really makes it the perfect dessert!  I only gave the recipe 3 stars b/c even with changes the users here gave (and w/o), the cream cheese part is not spectacular tasting.  I thought \"Brownie Caramel Cheesecake\" from this site had a better rating AND tasted spectacular! This is good enough for something quick though when you have to bring something to a potluck or kid's school.",
