I followed the measurements and the batter was like soup so I added more cake flour until I got a consistency of a drop cookie dough. I used one cookie sheet(thermal)with parchment paper on top and another with foil on the top(ran out of p. paper). They poofed up like meringe cookies while baking then fell when I took them out of the oven. I could not get them off the paper(never had any cookie stick like that to parchment). They tore all apart. The taste was just like eating straight almond paste which we love in any dessert recipe that we have tried. Will not try again and play with the recipe due to the cost of the almond paste.",
