Cheesecake is hard to judge when it is done and an overcooked cheesecake will become dry, so if you take it out when the centre of the cake is still a little wiggly it turns out just perfect. The most effective way to bake cheesecake is to bake it in a water bath. Have a dish with a little water in it that is bigger than the cheesecake dish and it sits in it to cook. Since water evaporates at the boiling point, the water bath will never get hotter than 212 degrees F (100 degrees C), no matter what the oven temperature. This means that the outer edge of your cheesecake won't bake faster than the center, which can cause it to souffl\u00e9, sink, and crack. I added cherry pie filling cherries on the top. I will definately share this with company as I already did my familly.",
