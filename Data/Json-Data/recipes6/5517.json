I have also halved the cheese and doubled the spinach on some batches to make them a little healthier. Very good this way too. At others' suggestion, I served this with \"Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce\" from this site. These were excellent and healthier than the original recipe. Very yummy!! Next time, I plan to add avocado to the rolls right before rolling. I think they'll be even better. :) ",

If you want to serve the sauce a chain made famous for these egg rolls, mix: 1/4 cup smashed, fresh avocado (about half of an avocado), 1/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tbs buttermilk, 1 1/2 tsp white vinegar, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp dried parsley, 1/8 tsp onion powder, dash dried dill weed, dash garlic powder, dash pepper.  Let the flavors set up overnight prior to serving as it makes the sauce so much better.  Enjoy!",

I baked them and served them with another reviewer's tip on a dipping sauce-the sour cream and salsa mixture.  These were incredible!  I plan on making more this week and freezing them. One note about freezing these-par bake them prior to popping them in the freezer so the egg roll wrapper doesn't break down.  I can't wait to make (and eat!) these again.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!",

I just added the drained, canned chicken into the mixture in the pan and broke it apart.  I highly recommend this.  It also works well with rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  With one can of chicken I felt the need to double the onion (used yellow onion) and bell pepper and needed about 1/2 can or more of black beans.  Also, I changed up the other ingredients a bit to suit our taste - eliminated spinach, jalapenos, parsley and cayenne and added 1/2 can diced green chiles, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and fresh ground pepper.  Kept the measurements on the seasonings as listed in the recipe.  I used soft taco sized flour tortillas but didn't stuff them as full as you would a burrito.  I ended up with 6.  No need to use toothpicks.  Placed them in a 9 x 13 pan lined with heavy duty foil and sprayed with PAM and baked at 425 for about 15-20 minutes.  If frozen (not necessary but good option) you'll need to cook longer.  Excellent result considering you just cut out a ton of fat by not deep frying.  Everybody loved them.",
