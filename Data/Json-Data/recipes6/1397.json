The only thing was with the glaze, getting the brown sugar to dissolve, I couldn't get it to dissolved until I added the cream.  Then it did almost immediately.  It was a fairly easy recipe.  I did need to bake it 55 minutes.  We cut into it immediately after I transferred it from the pan to a platter and poured on the glaze.  Yumminess!!\n\n5 years later and it's still a favorite! My coworkers are always asking me when I'm going to bring in more! So good!!",

The bread in the picture is darker than it turns out when it actually comes out of the oven it is a nice golden brown and the top is not flat. The glaze is not white like it shows in the picture but a light chestnut color. It has a beautiful flavor to it. Although I did not have kosher salt I cut the amount of kosher salt in half and substituted the kosher salt for Mortan salt (table salt) but it added such a unique flavor to recipe that it really completed the flavor and rounded the dish.",
