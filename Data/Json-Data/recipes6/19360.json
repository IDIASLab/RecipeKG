Both times I've made it I wanted two pies (the pillsbury pre-packaged crusts at our grocery store come in packs of 2) This first time I made one deep dish (in a nice ceramic pie plate) and another in a regular tin pie plate. Doubling the recipe gave barely enough filling. Yesterday I used a triple recipe and 2 nice ceramic dishes. I tripled the filling and the topping ingredients. This resulted in 2 nice deep dish pies. I did cook the pies a little longer just adding a couple of minutes to each step to be sure the deeper pies were thoroughly cooked. I found the recipe easy and the end result simply perfect.

A couple of calories and fat can be trimmed with reduced fat sour cream.  Like many others, I reduced the sugar to one half cup, and added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the topping.  Total baking time of one hour is needed....just follow the directions and add keep it in the oven for the extra time.",
