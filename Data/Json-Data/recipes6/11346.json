I used 1/2c brown sugar and 1c white sugar to cut down on the sweetness, and to give the spices more of a base to blend with.  I also used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  The cake flour lightens up the cake while still keeping it very moist.  Use 1 cup + 2 tbl cake flour to 1 cup all purpose.  I also add 2 teaspoons of apple liqueur along with the vanilla to give the apple flavor of the cake more of a boost.  This is by far the best apple spice cake I have come across in a long time.  Thanks!!",

If you love spicey this is the cake for you. The taste is wonderful but I will make again using less oil and a little more cinnamon. I used Granny Smith apples which I shredded in my food processor. I believe shredded apples lend more of the apple flavor than coarsely chopped. Thanks for a great recipe Kristin.",

I followed the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1 cup - it was perfectly sweet enough. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of butter and substituted 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. It was moist, spicy and delicious. Thank you - this one's a keeper!",

Instead of baking this in a tube pan, I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes. Instead of chopping the apples I grated them (leaving the skin on) to help the cake keep it's shape and not fall apart, and then frosted with a maple cream cheese frosting. The result was a super tasty, dense cake that was snapped up by everyone who was around.",

I took everybody's advice and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white but kept the same amount of butter as it's said in the recipe. Then I didn't add either nutmeg or allspice to the batter. Used only some cinnamon and a little bit cloves. I must say that I actually don't fancy too much cakes with apples and raisins too much but this one came out so tasty and with such a wonderful smell that I couldn't help eating a piece;-) Definitely will make this heavenly cake again!
