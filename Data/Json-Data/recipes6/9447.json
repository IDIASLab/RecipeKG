Flouring the meat before browning it adds all the thickening we need to make it stew rather than soup.  Most often I don't add tomatoes - they really take this in a sweeter direction, so omitting them makes a more savory stew.  I always add hominy... taking the dish in the posole direction but ever so much richer.  Finally, we served it with warmed flour tortillas and sour cream and shredded cheese toppings for those who like them.  And this pork/green chili combination works as a sauce - many like it over rice... and a great filling, with cheese, for burritos.",

I deglazed the pan with red wine, about 1/2 cup. \nSo, here is my make process for a large dutch oven:\nPreheat oven to 350.\nSaute the pork in dutch oven in batches. Reserve. \nAdd more oil and saute the onion until transparent. \nAdd the cumin and oregano (if using)\nDeglaze the pan with red wine, cooking until almost all gone.\nAdd everything else, giving it a good stir and bringing to a boil on the stovetop. \nCover and put in oven for about an hour. \nMine was perfectly tender in an hour. \nServe with tortillas.

I cubed the pork large about 3 inches, so it would not dry out as much as small cubes would. Then broke it into bite size pieces as it became tender. I also like to roast my chilies whole, then peel and seed. I think it is easier, because the Hatch chilies I had were a little thin.

I guess you could save the left over flour and you might even add extra ingredients to make German dumplings as a side dish. IF  as inferred all this flour was added to the dish with the pork I can only imagine the result was inedible.",

In a pinch you can substitute a 28oz can of diced green chillies; it won't have the same depth of flavor as fresh roasted but it is still great. I also like to sweat my onions before adding them to the slow cooker but that may just be personal taste. Finally I often spike it with some diced jalape\u00f1os to bring up the heat a touch. Use it as a sauce over burritos and you'll never eat them any other way again!??",
