I did use 2 chipotle peppers because we like our food spicy, and they came out just right. I was afraid that using 2 of them would overpower the meat, but it did not. Now here's a GREAT tip to keeping these tasty burgers moist: instead of adding a slice of mozzarella on top, make 8 thin patties instead of 4 thick ones. Put a heaping tablespoon of finely shredded mozzarella on the center of 4 of them and then top each with the other thin patty. Then just seal up the sides of the burger. That way, when you bite into one of these yummy delights, the cheese will ooze out of the middle. Even my husband enjoyed these, (he ate 2 of them!), and he NEVER has been impressed with any type of turkey burger! Thanks for submitting this one; I'll be making it again for sure!",

I made it just the way it is written except didn't have mozzerella so I used provolone.  I served it on whole wheat buns with sliced orange tomato.  It was delicious but next time I would use another chipotle b/c we like it a little spicier.  Our burgers were not dry at all - they were perfect.  I served sliced orange and red tomatoes and sweet corn on the side and we ate outside - perfect meal for a hot and sunny day!  Thanks for the recipe!",

It's cold here so I cooked on the electric indoor grill for about 7 minutes. Topped bun with lettuce, avocado slices (a must) and Mont Jack instead of mozzarella (personal preference). Followed others' advice and used two peppers. Just enough heat. Hubby was blown away. So impressed, these burgers will be a staple in our house. PS don't skip the cilantro, it adds a wonderful fresh taste and an extra layer of flavor.",
