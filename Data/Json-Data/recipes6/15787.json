The batter is the consistency of cookie dough so it was very thick and difficult to blend. The amount of oil was staggering (IMHO) so I scaled it to 1/4 c. oil & 1/4 c. applesauce. End result was a decent-tasting muffin especially when eaten hot w/ melty butter (albeit a bit dense and an unusual texture that I couldn't quite put my finger on possibly due to the berries being of the frozen variety?) so I'm not too sure that I would make this recipe again.",

And after I put the batter in the loaf pans I sprinkled cinnamon sugar. The bread came out beautiful - brown and crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.
