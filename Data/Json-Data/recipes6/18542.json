I made both recipes on the same days and they turned out almost identical in flavour.  However, the \"to die for blueberry muffins\" recipe had a thicker batter resulting in rounded muffin tops whereas this recipe is thinner so as it was rising the batter spread out more so the muffin tops were flatter. Vanilla is a nice addition to either recipe, and I would strongly recommend using only fresh blueberries.",

I really didn't use a lot, just a tiny sprinkling over each muffin. Really, really good. I think adding a little lemon rind would really take these over the edge.

I was expected something really good especially with the amount of blueberries and buttermilk in the recipe. However, even after adding 2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter I found these to be overly sweet and a bit on the bland side. I baked these in Texas sized muffin cups lined with paper liners and topped the muffins with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. I baked them at 400 for 23 minutes. And, while they baked up nice and big the flavor just wasn't there.... I think I'll stick to my TNT recipe \"Blueberry Cream Muffins\" from this site.",

Make a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar 2 Tablespoons of flour and 1 Tablesppon of butter. Mix it all together and top the muffins with that instead before putting in the oven -- YUMMY!",
