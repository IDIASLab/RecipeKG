It's nice that the filling doesn't have to be cooked on the stove prior to baking (like some sugar pie recipes).  I made this recipe with the No Roll Pie Crust II from this site and our grandmother's would be envious at how little time baking a pie from scratch can take....and still turn out great.  The only thing I did that the recipe doesn't state is I put the pie in @ 400 on the bottom rack for 10 mins, then turned the heat down and placed the pie on the top rack for the remaining cooking time. That's just something I do for all my pies because it helps prevent a soggy crust.",

I started daydreaming about chess pie. This recipe looked quick and simple so I did the following: 1. Substituted soy milk and butter-flavored Crisco for the milk and butter respectively. 2. Tossed a tortilla in the bottom of a pie pan because I didn't have a pie crust handy and didn't want to make one. It turned out fine just with a very thin crust which is what I expected. I only tossed in the tortilla to protect the bottom of the filling while it baked. 3. Made the recipe without any other changes. Results: Awesome! It's rich and wonderful just what I wanted. However it didn't set very quickly at all. After 40 minutes in the oven I turned the oven off and left the pie in to see if that would help. I think it might be prettier if I'd chilled it after baking and only cut into it when it was very firm. But all I was going for was yummy and easy to satisfy a selfish sweet tooth after Halloween and this fit the bill perfectly.",
