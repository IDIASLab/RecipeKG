One note: I think the recipe only calls for 2 pounds of meat. The mixture however can easily coat nearly 5 pounds of spareribs.",

Even though there was sugar in the rub they were less sweet than the typical BBQ ribs. I used unsalted butter to help keep them from burning and I used a large non-stick wok to do the browing. Then I added the beef broth to the wok and then transferred the entire thing to a crock pot and cooked on low for about 4 hours and then one hour on high. ( I needed the stove top to make other things we were having so I didn't want to have the giant wok on there taking up space.THe crock pot worked fine they were very tender but didn't fall apart.) I couldn't find the \"country style\" ribs so I just used 2 lbs of meaty baby back pork ribs cutting them apart before I coated them with the rub.They tasted great but the country style that the recipe actually calls for would have been better because I couldn't really brown the underside of the ribs due to the curvature of the bones and also the country ribs would have had more meat. The amount of rub to coat the 2 lbs was just perfect. I used Kitchen Basics beef broth. I will be making them again soon and often. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
