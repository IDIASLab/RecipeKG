                "reviewBody": "Great recipe. The four star rating is only because I changed the recipe a bit. I used regular pumpkin filling and added my own spices. I make a lot of flans so I also like a creamier taste and ended up adding the whole 10 oz. can of condensed milk. The flan came out very light and was incredibly easy to make. Next time for a denser flan I may substitute some or all of the evaporated milk with 1/2 and 1/2. Will make it less fluffy and more flan like. To the user who had a hard time getting it out of the pan - use a pyrex dish or loaf pan and a bit more sugar (1 cup) in the caramelization part in the beginning and be sure to coat the pan completely. This will help the flan pop right out of the dish and then there's a little more syrup to drizzle over the flan for a yummy presentation.:)",

I love flan too, and this recipe exemplified the best of both worlds. It was inexpensive and easy to make, but tasted like a million bucks, especially the leftovers two days after I'd baked it! For a creamy, delicate, more flan-like texture, I added the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and baked it for an extra half hour. The water had evaporated by about 1/2 after an hour of baking - if this is the case and you need more baking time, add more hot water and check for doneness about every 15 minutes.",
