The thing is folks, it tastes just exactly like a bbq chicken pizza, and said pizzas have chicken, red onion, cilantro & cheese. If you don't like bbq chicken pizza its no surprise that you wouldnt like this. I just think it kind of defeats the purpose of making a recipe called \"BBQ Chicken Calzones\" and then give it a bad rating because you dont like an ingredient. Anyway, thats my two cents. It really is a fool-proof recipe. Thanks!",

I use the WalMart Brand Pizza Dough mix you add water too and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce I also add some chopped onion before baking I really think that the cilantro adds an extra dimension to the calzone and shouldn't be omitted (unless of course you don't like it). I have also brushed the crust with butter spread before baking with excellent results. This is an AR fave.6/17/2007:These are delicious and so easy. I made \"minis\" for a bridal shower and everyone raved. The beauty of this recipe is you can you use whatever ingredients you like (try turkey kielbasa with green peppers onions pizza sauce and fresh basil); the one suggestion I would make is to saute garlic in a pan and brush over calzones before baking I have also found the cooking time to be a little excessive.",

Also I used canned crescent rolls to make the pockets b/c we enjoy anything made out of crescent rolls and I had some in the fridge.
