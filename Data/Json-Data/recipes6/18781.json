I sauteed the onion first and when it was translucent I removed it from the pan and set aside. I then sauteed all of the other veggies (doubling the tomato) until they were a little more than crisp tender. I then added some cooked chicken breast (about a pound) and the cooked onion in with the veggies and cooked a couple of minutes until heated through. I then added about a cup of shredded queso cheese stirred and then put a second cup over the top covered and let the cheese melt. I served with flour tortillas and Mexican rice. It was really good.",

As we transfered the zucchini to the serving dish we slowly sprinkled in the cheese in layers and stirred as we went. Out of a 1 pound bag we used MAYBE 1/3rd of it. It was cheese enough to hold the various veggies together without being overwhelming and making a huge mess. (Also cut a ton of calories out of it) Definately will make again.",

Which means something because I'm not one of those \"let's add bacon to everthing\" cook... Then I checked the amount of cheese and noticed I had used only a third of the recommended amount! I guess with 1.5 lb of cheese it won't be bland anymore. However we really enjoyed the dish and I'm probably making it again soon. With less cheese and more spices it's healthier and you can afford it several times a month!",

IMHO non-fat cheese doesn't melt or blend at all and low fat cheese just doesn't give the same mouth feel. It's worth the extra fat and calories (to me) to use real MJ cheese or pepper jack. If you're not vegan or opting for a vegetarian meal throw some leftover pork or chicken or even beef in it to round it out to a full meal with tortillas.",
