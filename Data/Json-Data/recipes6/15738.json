First, when you make crepes, you have to tilt the hot, slightly greasy pan and pour the batter in the from the edges. DO NOT start in the center or else you will end up with \"the batter would settle to the center before setting\" as stated in an earlier comment. Secondly, immediately after you cook them, place them in a tupperware with the lid covering them, but NOT sealed. This will keep them warm and moisten the edges and other crispy areas. This is the perfect crepe recipe! The taste and consistency are on point. So any complaints people have about this recipe is not because of the batter, it's because of not cooking them correctly. These are great and truly easy to make!",

Also I am a bit of a cheater on rolling the batter in the pan, I use a 12 inch non stick skillet with taller sides so that I get a perfectly round crepe every time and they don't get crispy this way if you put just enough batter to coat the pan then the whole things cooks evenly and you really don't have a need to flip the crepe. Mine came out pale and thin, I did not find that the sugar at all contrubuted to any kind of browning of the crepes as others mentioned, perhaps they are using a pan that is too hot, I cook mine on medium low heat and never have a problem.

                "reviewBody": "This is basically the same recipe I've been using since my French grandma taught me to make crepes years ago. It's all about the ratios - 1:2 flour to milk, eggs to bind, butter to lube it up, sugar and salt to taste.   If you're getting a bad result with this recipe, the problem is probably your heat settings. Too high, and you get dried curlies on the edges. Too low, and you get that thick-in-the-middle effect as the batter settles to the lowest point in the pan before it has a chance to set up. Don't just set the heat and let it go; keep adjusting as you cook and you'll find the balance point.   Also, let the crepe tell you when it's time to turn - you'll know because when you shake the pan, it will move freely. Then give it another 15-30 seconds and go for it. There should be enough butter hanging out in the batter to make buttering a non-stick pan unnecessary if your heat is right.   Making crepes is a very \"feel\" based endeavor, but this is an excellent recipe for people who didn't have the benefit of having a little old French lady in the house growing up. Thanks for posting! :)",
