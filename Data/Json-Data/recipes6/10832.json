I thought it was very good I halved the recipie and baked it in a 9\" sqaure pan I had to add about 1/4 cup more flour the batter was a little runny cutting circles w/a knife worked nicely. Next time I will not halve the topping and i will mix it together first. I also cooked it for 5-7 min. longer it had a nice crispy/chewey edge and a soft fluffy middle.",
