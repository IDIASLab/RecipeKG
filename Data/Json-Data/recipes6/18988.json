I also had several ingredients in the freezer which needed to be used up like a pork tenderloin with freezer burn some prosciutto (extra bonus) and ginger. I had my usual garlic in the crisper and just happened to have oyster sauce... so... voila!... I had everything except the beets... it still tasted OK... a bit sweet to eat every day (I used a cup of sugar) but good nonetheless... I would make it again and try some variations... I suspect it is a very forgiving versatile recipe... probably better with a veggie in it... beets or even green pepper...",

You either need 2 cups of water or 1/2 cup of rice. It's also VERY sweet and I used far less than 1-1/2 cups sugar. In fact, about 3 tbsp. The oyster sauce is very sweet as are the beets so I ended up putting in some soy sauce and adding a tsp of salt. I'll make it again but next time I'll use hoisin sauce instead of oyster.",
