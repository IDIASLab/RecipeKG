You may want to add more sugar if you want it sweetened.. I admit its a tricky recipe. Before you start:You need to cool the bowl that you are going to use for the whip cream and the beaters for at least 15mins before using them. (I usually put mine in the freezer). In another small bowl;Sprinkle gelatin over water mix and let it soften for 5 mins.( I microwave mine for almost 1 and half maybe 2 minutes total and I stir it every 30 to 60 seconds)..but not too hot as to a hot bubbly boiling because it will harden when it cools..only till it the liquid looks clear. let it stand room temperature and not too warm when you add it to the heavy cream.. use immediately. I have used it for shell borders stars and basket weave for decorations on cakes. It doesn't fall apart like the average whipped cream.. its not a smooth frosting but I think it depends on the long you cook the gel. I hope this helps.:-)",

I ended up picking out the gelatin chunks and frosted my cake with the whipped cream. Like others have suggested there should be some clarification on how to do the gelatin for those of us who have never used it. The gelatin was nice and smooth and after whipping it into the cream it was just stringy and didn't blend. I'm sure it is my fault but I can't find one recipe online that explains how to do this properly.",
