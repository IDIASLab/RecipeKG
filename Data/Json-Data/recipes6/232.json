I only had 3 bananas which turned out to be 1 1/4 cup after mashing.  I meant to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla but forgot until just now and I threw in two palmfuls of craisins.  I baked it for 55 minutes in a loaf pan and wish I had taken it out at 50 when I thought it was done.  It was a touch over done but I will be making this again when I buy more bananas than we care to eat.",

For the 2 cups of flour, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  In place of 1/4 cup butter, I use 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also reduce the sugar to 1/4-1/2 cup, depending on how sweet I want it.  And I add in a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I also use two 8x4 inch pans (since that's what I have), and it reduces the baking time to ~35 minutes.  Very delicious!",
