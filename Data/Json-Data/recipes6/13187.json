The canned tomatoes are salty enough. It was also to thick and pasty for clam sauce. I think it is hearty enough for meatballs or sausage. I find it interesting that the recipe got such high marks when the reviewers didn't even follow the recipe. Next time I will add olive oil and omit the tomato sauce. I will also add the clam juice during cooking but reserve the clams until ready to serve...this way the acid in the tomato sauce won't have time to make the clams tough. I think with a little tweaking this will be a better dish.",
