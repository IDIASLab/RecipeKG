I prepared the recipe with the ingredients exactly as written, choosing not to sub any brown sugar as other reviewers suggested.  I wanted to see for myself how the recipe stood on its own.  I was not at all disappointed. I think it would have been easier and neater to mix the batter up in a separate bowl, then pour the batter into the baking dish, but this is a minor issue. I spread the chopped apples over the entire surface of the batter, rather than confining them to the center as the recipe directs, and the \"pudding\" (which is cake-like) had evenly distributed apples throughout. I served this with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with warm caramel sauce. Mmmm, sweet autumn comfort food at it's best. Hubby must agree, as he went back for a large second helping!",
