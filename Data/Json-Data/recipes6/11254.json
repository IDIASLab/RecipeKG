I have always used: chocolate fudge cake mix instead of devil's, 4 eggs instead of two and boil the icing base for 1 minute instead of two.  TIP to make super MOIST:  after boiling icing base and adding chocolate chips, I pour the icing mixture over cake when chips are 1/2 to 3/4 melted (instead of smooth).  This allows some of the milk/sugar/butter to seep down into the cake, and also leaves small morsels of chocolate chips in the icing on top.  Super easy to make, knock your socks off taste.  ",

The recipe is a good place to start, but I have experimented with it since i have made it so many times.  Cake texture is MUCH better if you mix the wet ingredients together first (including your cherry pie filling), and also add 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup oil to those ingredients.  Then mix in your cake mix.  Also, instead of using the frosting recipe, I fold in dried cherries and chocolate chips to the batter, then bake, and serve the cake alone.  The dried cherries and chocolate chips definitely give the flavor of the cake a big boost!",

I baked it in a 10\" Bundt pan for about 40 mns and it came out perfect. The almond extract makes a big difference, so do not skip or substitute it. I suggest following the recipe exactly as is. The frosting is fudgy and fabulous. The cherry flavor is subtle, but still definitely there. The whole thing is much better the next day, however. You might not be that excited about it if you eat it when it's just out of the oven. Make the cake, pour the frosting on it per directions, and serve it the next day. It's a major hit!",

It's been around forever known as \"Chocolate Covered Cherry Cake\" It was the first dessert to disappear at a church function and nobody believed how easy it is to make! The chocolate icing is amazing and Soo easy. I can't wait to try it on other types of cakes/cookies in the future! I added pecans to the icing just because my dad loves them :o) I'm sure it didn't change the flavor all that much. I'm also planning to try this reviewer's ideas soon... \"Used a CLASSIC WHITE mix and BLUEBERRY filling. used VANILLA EXTRACT instead of almond, and added 1/2 of LEMON'S ZEST to batter, as well as a handful of huge frozen blueberries. Baked for 32 min in a bundt pan. For frosting I halved the recipe and used WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS in lieu of the chocolate and added the remaining LEMON ZEST from the lemon....absolute perfection. Due to less surface area, it was perfect to halve the frosting recipe for bundt\" ",
