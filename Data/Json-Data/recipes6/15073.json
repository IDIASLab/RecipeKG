We had just picked our huckleberries in the Columbia Gorge and they were very tasty so I thought they would be perfect for a pie. I followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the flour to 1/4 C and the pie was still very runny. It completely saturated the bottom and even the top crust. It was like eating mush. I've decided to make this again but instead I will make mini pies in cupcake tins to control the oozing and keep some consistency. Also I will not use the cream on the top either I don't think it did much except to add more calories.",
