Follow the recipe as is (I used a little less sugar as my strawberries are very sweet and ripe) use a smidgen more cinnamon and only use 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. As suggested my a previous reviewer use 1 egg 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup milk. Also mix in 1 and 1/4 cup chopped strawberries and 1 cup finely chopped (use food processor) pecans. Use muffin tin liners and fill to top quickly mix up heaping tbs. of flour heaping tbs brown sugar and 1 tbs butter mix until crumbly and sprinkle on top. This crumble is magic it wont stay on top but sinks in a bit for a delicious little extra oomph! BAKE FOR 20 MIN. And voila! Moist cakey strawberry-y muffins!",

I thought they were \"okay\" however my son loved them and ate three in a row. I might make them again but I would add more of the cinnamon and nutmeg and add a cinnamon-sugar topping.",
