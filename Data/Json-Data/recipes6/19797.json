First batch I used AP flour, 1 tsp vanilla, and also added 1 medium mashed banana with chopped walnuts.  Second time, I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour, and used vanilla/almond extracts per recipe.  All my pancakes can out with a nice light, fluffy, and smooth texture.  Rated 4 stars b/c though they are a good simple recipe, they are a little on the bland side.  And just a tip-as with any pancakes-I do find the fluffyness is effected by how u are mixing the dry ingredients with the liquids.  Do not overmix-combine until just moistened, and it will usually have some small bubbles in the mixure once it sets for a few minutes-do not mix these out-this is what will add in a light texture.",

I did not use eggs or the almond extract. I always use mayo in my pancake so that also took care of the oil. I had to add a little more soy milk but that could be because I routinely miss measure.

Given the lemon juice the baking powder is not necessary (cream of tartar is what gives the acidity to activate the soda but it also has an unpleasing flavor). Instead just use one 1 tsp baking soda. I used half all-purpose flour and half buckwheat flour reducing the total to about 3/4 c. instead of 1 c. This made very spongey pancakes. I may increase increase the soy milk and/or reduce the baking soda a little next time to have stretchier pancakes.",
