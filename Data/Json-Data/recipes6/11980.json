If it boils too long the sugar hardens quite a bit. You also definitely do not want to refrig. these and keep them in an airtight container instead of leaving them uncovered. I've also tried this w/the melted milk chocolate chips as some have sugg'd. YUMM!!!",

I also brought the corn syrup to a boil before adding in the sugar to prevent the hardness that others talked about. I made some with melted chocolate chips on top and some with raisins on top. Both varieties were good as well as just plain (I think I like them plain the best). Thanks for such a great & easy recipe! I will make these again and again.",
