I couldn't waste HALF a can of pumpkin so I doubled it right off the bat using a 15 ounce can of pumpkin. I ran out of flour so I used half all-purpose and half whole-wheat flour; I ran out of white sugar so I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. They turned out wonderful- I would say better than any other recipe I've tried! In the future I will use the half-wheat/half-brown sugar again. Also I use more spice than most of the pumpkin cookie recipes call for.. so I added a 1/2 tsp of clove 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of allspice in addition to the cinnamon. divine! Way better than store bought.",
