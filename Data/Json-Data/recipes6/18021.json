It was on the dry side for a cake. But since I never had a german chocolate cake before I wasn't sure if that's just the way they are. My boyfriend (his mom makes him a german chocolate cake every year) said it was almost as good as his mom's. But he did agree that it was a little dry. The icing was delicious. I would definitely make it again.",

This might be due to the fact that I baked the cake in a 9-x-13 pan. The flavor is very good but I think that I'll stick with my recipe because it produces a cake that isn't as dry.
