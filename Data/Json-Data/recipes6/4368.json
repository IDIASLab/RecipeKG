And letting it cook in mushroom soup was to my husband simply out of the question.  I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a whirl.\r\nThe flavor of the pork with the rub was excellent.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh and added a bit of oil to make a paste.\r\nThe only thing I would change is to try to figure out a way to cook the veggies so that they didn't overcook.  I found that the last step of letting them simmer for 20 minutes really killed the texture of the veggies.  Perhaps if the wine and the spices were added when the veggies were and they were cooked until fork tender..it would be better.  Just a suggestion.  I will definitely try this again and see.",

After the veggies were about halfway done I deglazed the pan (with the veggies in it) with some chicken broth and a bit of cider vinegar. Then I put the pork chops back in and added the tomatoes. I had to remove the pork chops again for a bit just so I could reduce the liquid in the pan without overcooking the chops. The veggies sauce thickened nicely. I can see that if you used zucchini you would want to add it towards the end; and i only used enough olive oil to brown the chops and saute the veggies. The rest wasn't necessary. I added a pinch of cinnamon and allspice plus celery salt and dried savory. Turned out great!",
