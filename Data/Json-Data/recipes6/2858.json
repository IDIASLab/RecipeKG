The tonic water is a must as is the brown sugar. The notes are absolutely intriguing because it tastes nothing like what I would have imagined. As I'm sipping this I can't help but think this drink is suitable as a mocktail. Surely is a tease for my tastebuds! I rimmed my glass with brown sugar crystals...yum yum!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.",
