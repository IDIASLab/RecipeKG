I think this recipe is meant to have unsweetened applesauce used in it. For my pie, I tried something a bit different that ended up being excellent. A certain famous applesauce brand whose name begins with an \"M\" sells all-natural \"no sugar added flavored applesauce in those little individual serving 6 packs. I made my pie with the peach flavor and it was delicious! I used between 3/4 and full cup of sugar and it was not too sweet at all. When making the pie, be sure to cover the crust edges with foil or pie protector during the last 10 mins. or so of baking so it won't burn.",

I boiled up 3 apples and made my own (2 large braeburns and 1 granny smith) with no sugar there.  I used a full cup of sugar and it wasn't too sweet.  However, I just added spices until I thought it looked \"spicy\" enough!  A bit of nutmeg, some cinnamon, cloves would be great in this I think...just a tad.  I also ended up baking this without the crust as my crust didn't turn out the way I would have hoped.  The only problem with that is the sugar crystallized on the edges.  Perhaps that's because I didn't use a mixer.  I probably cooked it a little longer than called for as I used smaller pie plates, but I loved the way it turned out.  The consistency was a bit like pumpkin pie...would be excellent with some whipped cream on top!  I think I'll be making this as an additional pie for Thanksgiving!",
