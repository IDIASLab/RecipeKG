When I first made Tiramisu (a different recipe), I went to my local supermarket and bought the only type of Ladyfingers they offered. They were hard as rocks (like Stella D'oro breakfast cookies), and even had a picture of Tiramisu on the package (No, they weren't just stale). You need to buy the soft variety. I have not come across a Tiramisu recipe that distinguishes between the two kinds of  Ladyfingers. My Ladyfingers did not absorb the liquids when following the directions to dip them for just a few seconds--and turned out unpleasantly chewy. Hope this info helps avert a first time flop for some Tiramisu lover.",

I didn't add any vanilla at all even though I was worried that since there were 6 egg yolks it will have this eggy smell, but it didn't, 4.  I only used espresso and no coffee liquer (1/2 cup water and 2 tbsp of coffee), 5.  I chilled the bowl that I was planning on beating the whipping cream in, make sure to get the whipping cream that looks like a milk carton in teh fridges, and not the 'whipped' cream.  6.  Mascarpone cheese isn't hard to find but it's expensive $8.99., 7.  Make sure to use the soft lady fingers, if you go to a large grocery store you wont' have a hard time finding them, I bought 3 10 oz packages, 8.  I refrigerated the mascarpone/egg mix while I was beating the whipping cream. 9. And this might be helpful, use a cheese cake pan, chill it, and the next morning you can just pop the tiramisu out.  It looked beuatiful!  I decorated it with some fresh raspberries and slices of strawberries, shredded chocolate and dusted cocoa powder.  Took it to work and everyone oooed and aahhhed at it.  It tasted very very good!!!! Keeper!  By the way, it's important you chill over night.",

Same recipie fromback of the ladyfinger package, except they gave a wonderful substitute for the marcapone cheese, it's one 8 oz package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream and 2 tbs heavy cream, whipped together...this was the best dessert I've ever made!

I substitute the Mascarpone cheese with 8oz of cream cheese, one-fourth cup heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of sour cream.  I use 2, 3oz packs of soft ladyfingers (bought from the bakery section of the local Kroger). I don't use coffee liquer, so I substitute with espresso (half cup water + 2 tablespoons instant coffee).  Serve it in a 3QT dish. Suggest keeping this dessert in the fridge overnight.  This Tiramisu is divine - thank you Carol for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

I scale the recipe to 10 servings so I can just use the 8 oz. container of mascarpone cheese.  2. I use the Savoiardi style hard ladyfingers, buy them in a 17.5 oz. Package (which has 60 ladyfingers) and use about 32.  I do not split the ladyfingers.  Also, I have used the soft ones from Trader Joes but do not like the result as much.  3. I like to layer the dessert in a loaf shape. Yes, your \"filling\" should be thick enough to do this! I sometimes use two 9.5 c \u201cZiploc\u201d containers and make two, 2-layer desserts 2-go or 2-gift!  4. I use a hand-held electric mixer when cooking the egg yolks & sugar (for the full 10 min. on low heat).  5. I refrigerate the mascarpone mix while beating the HEAVY whipping cream, in a chilled bowl, until it is super stiff.  5.  Instead of the Kahlua, I make two 6 oz. cups of extra strong coffee (4 TBSP coffee per 6 oz water). I dunk the ladyfingers completely, but quickly, in the coffee.  6.  It is even better a day or two later and has a wonderful ice-cream quality if you can freeze/thaw it before serving!  Thanks so much for the recipe Carol!",

But since they're kinda expensive to buy, I'll be using the recipe for ladyfingers by roxanne. I always end up using more mascarpone cheese, than called for. So much creamier. And I always use lots of kahlua. Wonderful presentation and always get rave reviews. Thank you for the recipe!!\r\n   One reviewer had problem whipping the cream. The first time I made this recipe I had the same problem. The solution for me has been to use heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream. It will never turn to curd no matter how long you beat it and you don't have to watch out for the split second between cream and curd the way you have to with regular heavy cream. You should be able to find whipping cream in the same row as the heavy creams.",

I used a pyrex 9\" x 13\" pan.  I made a single layer of ladyfingers, poured some of the coffee liquer on top, then the whipped cream/cheese mixure, and repeated this two more times.  I do like my tiramisu to be really wet with the coffee flavor, so I made an additional cup of coffee, added an enthusiastic amount of french vanilla creamer (2-3 T I guess), let it cool down a bit, and poured it over top the top layer of ladyfiners, before making the last layer of whipped cream & cheese.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.  It was delicious!!!!  My friend said it was some of the best tiramisu he's ever had.  Will DEFINITELY make again.",

Then in a separate bowl combine syrup with egg yolks and whisk to the thick lemon yellow consistency. \nThis made it much easier since it was my first time with a double broiler. Plus with this method all the sugar melts and the yolks won't end up being cooked.",
