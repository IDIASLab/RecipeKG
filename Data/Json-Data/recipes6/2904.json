I made this during the day because I was skeptical of the long cooking time. I checked it at 4 1/2 hours and it was already sticking very badly to the pot and just about to burn. Next time I would either decrease the oats to 1 3/4 cup or increase the water by at least 1/2 cup and only cook for 4 hours. It is very tasty though!",

I added 1/2 tsp of ginger and cloves and reduced the nutmeg by 1/2 tsp but that's a personal preference. I've used spray oil in the slow cooker, but I find that buttering by hand is a bit better, although it still sticks. Worth it to wake up to breakfast already cooked!",
