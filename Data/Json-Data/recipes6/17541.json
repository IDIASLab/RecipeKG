I had to make it my own, so I made the cream cheese layer (with splenda blend) and tried variations to it by spreading a layer of either apricot, blueberry, blackberry or strawberry sugarfree preserves over the cream cheese then finishing off with the crescent dough and butter and splenda blend sprinkled on top... OMG, I had to make this 3 times in 2 days due to so many people loving it over the holidays!!!  No one could guess it was sugarfree..  the fruit topping over the creamcheese really gives it kick!  My fav were the blueberry ones, and the apricot... with the apricot I crushed 1/2 C of pecans and sprinkled those over the top with cinnamon and splenda blend.. that was sheer heaven.  Even better the next day if thats even possible!  I am thinking about trying this with a variation of no sugar, but using a packet of hidden valley ranch powder and bacon and maybe some sundried tomatoes... maybe butter and parmesan on top?... I will let you know!  ",

We greased the pan and sprinkled cinnamon sugar in the bottom of each muffin hole.

Little bite size cream cheese balls. Plus the girls and I had fun making them.",

Also, I didn't put sugar on the top, just mixed up powdered sugar and a bit of milk and make a white glaze. Thanks for the post.",

I tried the addition of fruit preserves and did not like it at all UPDATE #2: I usually make this in my 9X13 glass Pyrex but made it in a 9X13 metal cake pan and it was horrible -overcooked around the edges and the crescent dough on the bottom was raw in the center of the pan.  I'll have to remember to always use my glass pan for this recipe.",
