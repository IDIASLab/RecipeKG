The only thing I did differently is I used the remaining ganache that was to be pored over the final layer as a fluffy icing. I chilled it and then whipped it until light in color and fluffy. Then I just iced the cake as you normally would. I do recommend bringing this cake to room temperature before serving. It was a huge hit and I will defiantly make it again. I give it five starts!

It was fantastic; it looked good and it tasted wonderful--restaurant quality in appearance texture and taste. Next time I think I'd double the filling. To optimize the appearance of the cake it's a good idea to trim around the edges to make sure the layers are even--this makes the ganache looks its best. Strong orange and chocolate flavors for anyone out there who really likes that combo! Thanks for an outstanding recipe!",

Not the case at all. I followed the recipe exactly and served it for company. I did however take the advice of other readers and add canned mandarins for appearance and flavor and it was awesome that way. Everyone raved. Not only does it look fabulous but the individual layers and flavors are so well balanced. The cream cheese frosting went perfectly with the chocolate ganache and the orange cake. And none of it is too sweet which I really appreciate. It takes a bit of time to prepare but not too much and it certainly isn't difficult. We will definitely be having this again.",

I checked to see today how the guests liked it and it was a hit! I did change the way I frosted it though covered both seperate layers in the ganache and waited for it to harden. I spread the orange cream filling on the bottom layer and topped it with the second later. Instead of covering the entire cake (sides and all) with the ganache I made a simple cream cheese frosting and spread that along the sides and piped some decorative icing along the top edge of the cake. It was beautiful! I am rating this cake as four stars though because while I loved the density of it the layers were just a bit dry. I'm going to try playing with the recipe a bit to see if I can achieve a bit more moistness. All said though this is DELICIOUS! The orange flavor is not overpowering and the combination of the orange and chocolate is wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing! If anyone has any ideas on how to deal the moistness please let me know.",
