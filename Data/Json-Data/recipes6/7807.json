My filling calls for 1 lb dates, 2/3c. brown sugar, 2/3c. orange juice, 1tsp vanilla extract & 1Tbs lemon juice. I also puree the filling in the processor. The oatmeal mixture calls for 1 1/2c rolled oats, 1 1/2c flour, 1c brown sugar, 1/2tsp baking soda & 2 sticks butter.Pat half of mixture in a greased 9x13\"pan, spread with filling and top with remaining oatmeal mixture. It's important to press this top mixture slightly into the filling before baking. Bake at 350 for 40 minutes. Don't give up because this is a wonderful recipe.",
