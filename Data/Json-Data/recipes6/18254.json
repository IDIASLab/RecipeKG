It was like a cross between a cheese biscuit and yeast bread with a nice crunchy crust. The only changes I made were to leave out the onion powder and to use 1/2 cup shredded cheese instead of cubed. I drizzled the batter with 2 tablespoons melted butter mixed with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and let the dough sit in the pan for about 15 minutes prior to baking. I used JW Dundee's Honey Brown lager. Very nice and quick change of pace!",

Because of being cooked in a cast iron skillet not only is there a bottom crust (good) but the top of this bread is hard and crunchy also due to the nature of beer bread and that's not so good. I even buttered the top of my bread with melted butter before baking and still wound up with a hard (though tasty) crust. I did like the addition of dill because I'm always looking for an excuse to use more of that but overall cook this one in a standard loaf pan so that there's less surface area of the hard top crust to contend with. (It'll fit.) The cheese was lost in this recipe; you need to either add more use a harder cheese or omit it and serve slices of cheese on the side because 4 oz. cubed cannot be tasted in the end product (and adds another dimension to the whole chewy-crunchy-edges thing on all sides). Thanks Mark for a tasty beer bread that I can easily adjust to be perfect for my family's tastes!",
