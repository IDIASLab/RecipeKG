I used 5 lemons instead of 6 (I squeezed until I had about 1 cup of juice) and added this to the brown sugar and water inside of a pitcher. I tasted it after I was done and the tart after taste told me to add more water. Added the ice cubes and put in the fridge to chill. It's a hit at parties! Honestly based on other reviews this seems to be a hit or miss based entirely on personal taste. Don't be afraid to experiment with different proportions and adding things. I know next time I am probably going to add some mint! Hope this helps!",
