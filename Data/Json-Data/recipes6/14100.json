I used a rub of sage, rosemary, salt, garlic, shallots and olive oil on the roast.  The house smelled great! My roast didn't take as long to cook either, at 7.75 pounds, but I was keeping an eye out, so it turned out moist and tender.  I laid some apples cut in half on the rack with the roast when cooking, and put them on the outside of the platter when serving.  Made quite the presentation, bone booties and all!",

My roast was 10 lbs and it still came out quite dry. My oven has an accurate temperature for baking. Next time I will cook it at the high temperature the first hour and then reduce the heat to 325.",

Namely because it is simple enough yet fancy or elegant enough to make your family and friends feel as if you \"really\" care and out did yourself! I opted not to include the apple juice too much moisture can be just as bad as too little. I also sauteed the onions and celery in the butter and used Ocean Spray Jelled Cranberry sauce. I whipped the sauce and then added it into the onion/celery sautee allowing it to melt/meld. I added three cloves of minced garlic to this mix at the end of the cooking time (right about 10 minutes before the end of cooking)and added everything to a large bowl mixing with a wooden spoon. I also deleted the egg there is no need for this binder if you do not use the apple juice. If you find your stuffing to dry for your liking add a little apple juice a little at a time until you achieve the desired level of moistness. Nontheless your family and friends will feel warm and fuzzy and you will feel pretty darn good yourself when you serve this roast!",

It's too bad it's not in a cagagory by it's self because people may not find it. So if your looking for a roast I suggest you do a loin roast and follow the recipe I found on this site with 1/2 cup vinegar plus 1 tsp thyme and go directly to the stuffing. I followed the recipe as directed and it got rave reviews from everyone. I never thought anything could replace my mother's stuffing but this will come close at least some of the time. This is great!

Being a self-taught cook I wasn't aware that with crown pork roast it's sometimes better to tell how much you're getting with number of ribs not weight. I got a 12 rib roast to feed my crowd and it worked out very well. I rubbed it before putting it in the oven with a rosemary garlic pepper and little but of thyme mixed with olive oil to make a paste. It smelled so good while cooking and the dressing was beautiful and tasted great. It is so easy to prepare and looks so elegant that you can't go wrong!! Keep in mind however that it is NOT an inexpensive dish..definitely for special occasions only.",

It was BEYOND amazing. I cannot believe I was too intimidated to try one of these for so long....and yes it can be pricey for a single piece of meat but per person it is quite reasonable. I followed other reviewers who said I should only allow the internal temp to reach 155-160 before removing and it was perfectly cooked. I also made a light sauce to go with. I sauted shitaki mushrooms then used the liquid that cooked out of the mushrooms to add to a tbsp of butter & flour to make a light roux. After a could minutes I added a cup of chicken stock 2 tbsp balsalmic vinegar & about 1/4 cup of drippings from the roast & salt/pepper to taste. It was wonderful!!! It was one of the best pieces of meat I ever tasted.....and I MADE IT! Thank you so much for teaching me how to do it!!",
