I also added sauteed onions to my mashed potatoe mixture. Other than that this was just like my grandmother used to make. It wasn't as hard as I expected. Thank you so much for this recipe. Next time I will add some sauerkraut to the mixture. My grandmother also did these with plums and just boiled them. When they were done she would top them with sour cream and sugar. I know it sounds weird but they were wonderful! Now I have the dough recipe and can make many variations. Thank you!",

The first 10 I followed the instructions and well..they weren't good. When rolling the dough roll it to a 1/4 inch. The cut out with the smallest cutter you have I used the smallest biscuit cutter about an inch. Most people wouldn't have a glass small enough. A childs juice glass might work. When you have all those cut out there's about 70. THEN roll them again to almost a paper width. I used almost all the filling and they didn't taste like breading. That being said..and being Polish...they did NOT taste like my grandpas... I don't think they're worth the work.",
