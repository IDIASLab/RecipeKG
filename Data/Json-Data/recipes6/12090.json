The cookie is very good, light with a nice chocolate taste. The vanilla filling is not very stiff so don't use too much because it will just squeeze out the side when you bite into them. I also made some with peanut butter filling (half PB and half confectioner sugar). I couldn't eat more than two. I guess I could eat three if you dared me...four if you questioned my manhood...but I'd rather stop at two.",

The flour softened the very-sugary taste & I'll probably add flour next time as well. Such a good recipe!",
