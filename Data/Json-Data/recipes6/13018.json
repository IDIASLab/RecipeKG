If you're new to it boiling the milk for two minutes without stirring seems extreme but it just makes the consistency a little bit more carmelly. I added an extra cup of oats and made these into cookies. Also I added the cocoa powder with the dry ingredients (I've tried both ways and this sets better). I used natural peanut butter (like an earlier reviewer) and found that letting it rest in the fridge for even an hour helped them set perfectly. For those who want to indulge immediately I agree that the consistency is gooey. Yummy either way!!",

Be sure and stir the mixture over MEDIUM heat so it has time to thicken before coming to a rolling boil. I used fat-free evaporated milk, old fashioned oats, and adam's natural creamy peanut butter and I'm really happy with how it came out. I think what makes this recipe so good is the evaporated milk instead of regular milk and the large amount of vanilla. I was worried about putting that much in but it made it taste soooo good.",

I followed the directions even the 2 min. boiling time without stirring which I thought was wierd. Could it be because I used natural PB? (It just contains no sugar and no hydrogenated oils). Help! I've attempted to make a few similar recipes for no-bake cookies and in the past 5 years they've only turned out once for me. (And I used to make these all the time in junior high and high school and they always turned out!) They didn't harden up correctly. Since they're in the fridge they are firm but not the right texture. They stayed goopy. They'll be fine heated up in the mircorwave but not what I was wanting!",
