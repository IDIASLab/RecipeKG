We made it by hand as I had to make a quadruple batch. We found the recipe to be more like jalapeno bread with some cornmeal. I would change the ratio to 2/1 bread flour to corn meal. Definitely nice with the extra peppers! (THANKS!)We found that it had to cook for about an hour (cake pan) before it was not doughey any more. Also butter the top and add some Kosher salt for a very nice twist! Overall loved it and will make it a keeper.",
