I made it according to the recipe. After it jelled we tried it. The blueberry skins made the texture chewy; so I emptied the container into a saucepan heated it then ran it through a strainer. Once cooled I refrigerated it overnight. It jelled again and made for a very nice blueberry spread that would be great on top of waffles or pancakes. It reminds me of a cross between blueberry syrup and jello. Thank you Lovesmurfs for sharing your recipe!",
