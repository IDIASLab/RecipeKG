I subbed black beans for the kidney beans as we are not huge fans of them but love black beans. Reading the 09 review they mentioned need extra dressing. I prepared 1 batches of dressing BUT ONLY used 2/3 cup of sugar that 1 batch called for. It has a very slight tang but we prefer that over sweet. This would be very easy to modify using veggies that your family enjoys. I made this for lunches this week (3 packers) and wanted something besides a mayo based dressing. I know I will be making this one again!",

At first I used only half the sugar for a double batch then realized it really needed it. The longer you cook the less tangy it becomes as the vinegar cooks off somewhat. Dressing was yummy. The veggies I used were frozen peas and carrots and one can of corn. I excluded the bell pepper onion and celery. I used ziti pasta. Great recipe for a potluck style pasta make it your own way!
