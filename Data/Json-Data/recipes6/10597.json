The only difference that I did with the dough is adding 2 teaspoons of sugar...it gives it a slightly sweeter flavor I suggest it highly!!

BTW:  \"proofing the yeast\" means stirring it in the warm water, (I added 1/2 the sugar then, too) and letting it set until it's foamy (about 10 min).  I followed the recipe exactly (except adding 1/2 the sugar to the proofing yeast and 1/2 after).  I used my Kitchenaid w/the dough hook for the *hard* work.  I let it rise for about an hour, then placed it in the frig for awhile when I went out.  I took it out to come to room temp before using.  Mr. LTH grilled w/no issues, though I wasn't very clear in my instructions, so he grilled BOTH sides before I could top, so after topping I popped in the oven on broil to warm toppings/melt cheese.  This is so cheap & easy it will def be a staple at our house...so many topping combinations to try (Mr. LTH had \"traditional\" cheese pizza and I brushed mine w/EVOO/garlic and topped w/diced red bell pepper, sweet onion, tomatoes, feta cheese, Italian Cheese Blend, and crushed red pepper.).  If you haven't made this yet, MAKE IT!  THANK YOU for an excellent recipe!",

I also followed the other reviews who suggested 5 minutes on one side then remove from the grill and top the cooked side and put back on grill for 3-5 minutes. Once grilled nicely on the bottom I move up to the top rack of my grill and the cheese melts...yum! We will definitely be using this recipe throughout the summer--much cooler cooking on the grill than heating up the kitchen! Thank you for sharing!!",

I used my kitchen aid mixer with dough hook attachment to mix. Even with floured hands dough was very sticky. I divided into 2 separate dough balls to rise for 1 hour. The dough was very delicate and still quite sticky so I added more flour and kneaded some before rolling out into about two 8\" circles. Used a charcoal grill/smoker and got heat up to 250 degrees. Placed on grill without toppings first because my dough was a bit thick. Grilled one side removed from heat and added toppings. One pizza was basil pesto fresh mozzarella and fresh picked roma tomatoes (Pioneer Woman recipe). Back on the grill another 5 minutes then put under the broiler on low for 3 minutes. Second pizza was tomato sauce shredded mozzarella and pepperoni. The second pizza we put toppings on before grilling. However because our crust was thicker in took longer to grill. Had to place under the broiler for a few minutes also. Make sure to place your toppings on your pizza dough after you place it on the pizza peel! When I make these again I will grill one side first BEFORE adding the toppings.",
