        "description": "Most people who replace their ground beef with buffalo, in recipes like meatballs, burgers, and meatloaf, are usually disappointed. Ground buffalo is much leaner than ground beef, which is the biggest challenge. In case you're new, it's the fat that provides most of the flavor and moisture. Also, for whatever reason, pre-packaged buffalo is ground very fine, almost to a paste, which can lead to a rubbery meatloaf, unless you use a few tricks.",

Once again this was the wise choice. No substitutions no deletions no additions. I added the optional glaze and think it really added to the dish. I trust my butcher and after reviewing this recipe he suggested that I use 90% lean bison instead of 85% lean. This is an expensive ground meat as compared to beef but I think the expense is worthwhile if one's budget allows.",

I think it turned out pretty good anyway. The wrapped bacon looks beautiful and tastes amazing too. I did use the glaze and it helps the bacon get a more even brown golden color besides tasting delicious. Make sure that your meatloaf is not touching any of the pan walls because the bacon will not brown or get crispy. Mine was barely touching it from the ends and those sections the bacon stayed soft (I hate soft bacon) also be aware that the bacon you tuck at the bottom of your meatloaf will not get crispy either.",
