It just sounded kind of strange and I didn't think it would turn out with a nice consitency with no milk, cream, sour cream, etc.  I was very wrong and the reviews were right.  I don't usually make mashed potatoes because they are trouble.  This recipe is super simple.  No peeling potatoes, no guessing how much milk to add, no endless mashing with lumps remaining.  This came together like magic.  Just boil, drain, and mash with butter and cheese.  A great addition to my recipe box and a terrific way to use up fresh produce at the end of the week!  Boiling the garlic with the potatoes is genius as well.  Try this even if you are skeptical.  You won't be disappointed!",
