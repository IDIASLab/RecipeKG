All of my guests couldn't wait to try it and all agreed it tasted like a Twinkie but even better. I used a Duncan Hines yellow cake mix. I think Duncan Hines are the best cake mixes. The filling was fabulous and went together easily although you need to be prepared to beat it for several minutes. I agree it needed to be a tad sweeter and I ended up adding maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar. I made it Saturday afternoon and we ate it Sunday afternoon. I saved back a piece for myself and ate it Monday night. It was even better then. The second time I made this cake I did it for church treats. I baked the cake mix in two cookie sheets. It was very thin. I doubled the filling and topped one cake with the other. They looked exactly like Little Debbie Banana Twins after I cut them. The entire church went crazy over the cake. One Lady said she had never had wedding cake that tasted as good. I will make this cake again and again and again.......Thank you Carol!",
