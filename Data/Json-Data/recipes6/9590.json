Perhaps I used too much water as there was no amount recommended, just a vague height about the beans in the pot. All in all, my kitchen is a mess and this is one I would do again!",

You can adjust the heat by adding the the jalapenos until you're happy with the heat you want. I enjoyed vinegar in the pickled jalapenos. Complex flavors yummy! I didn't do the bacon only because I didn't want the added fat. I got plenty of flavor by using ham hocks. I'm sure the bacon step would be delicious! I will be looking for these beans again and making this soup many times!",
