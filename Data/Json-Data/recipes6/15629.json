I added more vinegar (didn't measure, probably ~3-4T), cumin (~2T), and the rest of the package of cilantro (I ended up using a whole package from the store), and 2 cloves of garlic.  Finally I substituted olive oil (that I had sitting for about a month or so with red peppers and seeds in it).  Overall, it turned out excellent, everyone liked it.  I think adding cumin makes a big difference in making this a southwest-like slaw.",
