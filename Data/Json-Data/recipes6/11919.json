I added 1/2 tablespoon corntarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water to the fruit, to thicken it. I have also used dried apricots and/or an assortment of dried fruits that I put in the food processor to chop up. I boiled these in orange juice (no water). In the oatmeal mixture, I added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, just to give it a little more flavor. Another filling is Cranraisins and dried apples boiled in apple juice. I am sure that others will come up with many other varitions. ",

I had a Meyer lemon and used the juice from that and also simmered the squeezed lemon halves in the date mixture for a more lemony flavor. I also added a little cinnamon to the the mixture only about a half a tsp. I followed the recipe exactly the same after that and was very pleased with the result. It does seem that any favorite dried fruit would work with this recipe and I look forward to trying out different combinations as well as the original all date recipe.",
