I changed the recipe a bit in hopes of improving the taste. I added an egg to make the meat stick together better also finely chopped half a medium onion minced 4 cloves of garlic some oregano garlic powder smoked paprika pinch of sugar chili powder sage and ground basil. I reduced the amount of salt since the blue cheese (I thought) was enough flavor. I think the more blue cheese you can get in it the better just a problem of trying to keep the patty together I had really squeeze it tightly. I am considering in just mixing the cheese in next time instead of trying to put it in the center.",

I stuffed about 2 Tbs. of blue cheese crumbles into a fairly large ball of meat pushing the meat around the cheese. I wanted my burger to be fairly large. To avoid the burger falling apart I didn't turn it over until the first side was nicely browned and somewhat stiffened. I was careful not to press the top of the burger while it was cooking as I wanted to keep it juicy and not dried out. Once I cooked the second side until it was well-done on the outside and felt firm around the edges I was able to flip it over one more time to finish cooking. The burger remained in one piece. I sprinkled Mesquite flavoring garlic powder and freshly ground pepper onto the burger while it was cooking. The cheese was salty so the burger did not require any additional salt. I served it on a toasted bun with mustard and ketchup and topped it with sauteed onion rings. It was the best burger I have ever made! It was totally cooked but was very moist and flavorful.",

It worked quite well though I didn't taste the cheese very strongly; perhaps it would be better to have it all gathered in the middle together for greater flavor impact. Otherwise this was a very simple and quick way to fix burgers so though I've had burgers with more interesting flavor I appreciated the ease of preparation! Thanks for the recipe Jenn!",

Made some modifications to suit my taste; I used one package of ground bison and about a half cup of blue cheese (we're cheese lovers) added Montreal steak seasoning (about a Tbsp) and mixed in 1 egg to help it all stick together. I mixed the cheese in with everything instead of stuffing it in the middle mostly just for convenience. I made small pattys bar burger size and pan cooked them. Took about 5 minutes on each side to cook med-well. They came out delicious! Didn't have any trouble with them falling apart. We didn't have buns and ate them without any toppings. These were so flavorful and juicy that we didn't really need them. Even my 15 month old son gobbled one up. We will definitely be making these again!",
