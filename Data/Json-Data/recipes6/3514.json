After I took the chops out of the frying pan, I added the pan drippings to the sauce. I just couldn't dump them. I think it added some more flavor. I only put half the sauce on the chops when putting in the oven, and used the rest of the sauce on the chops when serving.  The next time, I will only make half the sauce since I only make 2 chops for 2 of us.  I'll keep this recipe.",

The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 cup of honey (I ran out), and that was plenty sweet--I think 1 cup would have made it too sweet for my tastes.
