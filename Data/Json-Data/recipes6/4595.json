Definitely add the zucchini and green beans (I added sliced baby portobello mushrooms also) toward the END of cooking time, not at the beginning, or they'll be mush.  I used tiny elbow macaroni instead of broken spaghetti, and cooked it separately before adding to the pot.  The tomato-basil pistou definitely makes this soup (and sidenote: try dunking some bread in the pistou before you add it all to the soup...mmm!).  On it's own, it's just an ordinary (bit bland) veggie/bean soup but the pistou gives it a great flavour punch.  Served with some shavings of a good parm reggiano, crusty bread, and a decent chardonnay, this is a very warming and satisfying meal.  Looking forward to taking leftovers for lunch at work this week!  (makes a big pot)",
