I feel if you want cake - eat cake. If you want a cookie then the cookie should taste like a cookie and by that I mean the texture should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and that is exactly what these cookies deliver. I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup and refridgerated the dough for 30 minutes rolled the dough into walnut sized balls then flattened them slightly. They baked up perfectly round flattened and slightly cracked in appearance. They looked like they came staight from a bakery. Great recipe thanks for sharing.",

Frankly I don't care if they're crispy chewy or cakey so long as they're delicious and baked properly. The debate will go on forever as to which is \"the best\" as there are so many good recipes--and this is certainly one of them. I prepared them exactly as the recipe directs wanting to judge the outcome for myself and they were perfect. I chilled the dough to firm it a little to avoid spreading then used a small ice cream scoop and flattened them just slightly--I found they come out of the oven much as they go in. These are perfectly shaped rounded beautiful cookies that didn't flatten out--picture perfect. It is not a novel idea to use both oil and butter in cookies nor is the addition of cream of tartar. These were NOT greasy as some reviewers mentioned and the cream of tartar gives them a pleasant light and sandy texture. I don't know if this is \"the best\" chocolate chip cookie out there(because there will NEVER be one) but these sure are darn good! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",

Although the \"typical\" chocolate chip cookie lover likes his/her cookies soft and chewy there are some of us that prefer a crispier cookie. It is exactly as the name states: Chocolate Chippers. Why there are so many people that gave it a bad review is beyond me. I don't try recipes that don't sound like something I would like so why would they?? Tina I'm with all those people that think your cookies are great. Thanks so much for the recipe!! It seems like every recipe I try for chocolate chip cookies makes soft chewy cookies that just do not satisfy my cravings but this one is perfect. For those that don't like the dough so greasy if you reduce the oil to 1/2 cup it will give you a combo of both cripsy and soft cookie. The taste is WONDERFUL! Thanks again Tina!!",

I ran out of time and had to refrigerate the dough overnight before making. The next day I let dough come to room temperature before baking. My first tray was 1 1/2\" cookies baked for minimal time stated bottoms came out too brown. Next tray was 2 1/2\" cookies and these were better. I placed in an airtight container overnight but no difference in texture.",
