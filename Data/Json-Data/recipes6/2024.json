I used a full cup of orange juice and just simmered the chopped dates until they were a nice gooey texture. I didnt have whole wheatflour so I just used regular all purpose flour and because my MIL is diabetic I used Splenda brown sugar. FYI Im not a date fan so I experimented with craisins and it was faaaaaabulous",
