I baked this in my oven which I admit runs hot for 13 minutes. I removed what I thought was a properly baked cake. I let it cool and coated with powdered sugar etc. but when it was time to roll it up I found that the cake split into pieces rather than roll.\n\nI also feel the need to tell anyone attempting this dish to make a bit more cake bather than you feel is needed. the reason is that When I poured the batter into my standard size jelly roll pan, I had just enough to coat the bottom. If I made a bit more perhaps that would have compensated for the bake time. Good luck.",
