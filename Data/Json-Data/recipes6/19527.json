I didn't use caraway seeds; because some of the reviews said the bread lacked flavor I added two teaspoons of sea salt to the dough and topped the egg wash with something different on each loaf. One each plain sesame seeds garlic powder rosemary thyme celery seed dried minced onion and Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic mix. The bread was soft and yummy we enjoyed it very much! Took a little over 30 minutes total in the oven. Update: Made this again this time I topped with dried minced garlic (used only egg white for the wash). I convect baked at 325 for 18 minutes. Yum!",

Both turned out the same. However I did mess up the first recipe by accidently adding the egg to the dough. Produced a denser bread but still good. I suggest adding herbs and spices right to the dough mix. I added onion and tarragon to one mix the other was spicy garlic. FANTASTIC! If you want thin loaves use your pasta machine. I made all of mine single serving cut dough into 10. This is a staple in my recipe box. SUPER easy. I am going to try wheat flour next.",

Nevertheless these turned out great. I patted (rarely use a rolling pin) them very thin and sprinkled with a mixture of toasted sesame seeds and a bit of kosher salt before baking (did use the egg wash). I baked them on a stone and they are nice and crispy outside witha bit of soft fluff inside. They'll go perfectly with my veggie curry tonight! Thank you for the recipe...adding to my recipe box now...oh and I also used a half and half mixture of AP flour and white whole wheat.",
