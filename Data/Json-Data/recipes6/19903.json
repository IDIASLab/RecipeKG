Has a stronger coconut taste, and lends a firmness that makes this wonderful cake even better!",

I followed the recipe exactly and used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer to beat everything so it was nice and fluffy. I also let everything get to room temperature before mixing. It baked up beautifully in exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes and the smell in the house was nothing less than heavenly. Make no mistake, this cake is rich and dense so it's not something you'd make on a regular basis but it definitely fits the bill for special occasions. I served it with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and toasted coconut - YUM!",

One caution I would make. Although we cooked it for the full 1 hr and 20 minutes and it appeared to be done by testing with a skewer, when cooled and cut at the fair there were small pockets which were not fully cooked. So my advice would be to bake it 1 hr and 25 minutes. This is wonderful with fresh strawberries\r\nor ice cream. It freezes well too.",

I also made sure that all ingredients were at room temperature prior to mixing.  Also, I baked at a temperature of 300 starting in a cool oven (no preheating).

If you just intend to serve it at home or if you are covering the cake with strawberries and cream and presentation isn't as important you might do as I did. I baked it in a 9 x 13 inch pan and it was done in less than an hour. While it cooked I prepared supper and then used the pre-heated oven to cook my dinner. I made the recipe just as given except I did add more coconut extract. To be honest as much as I LOVE the flavor of coconut I wish I had not because I served mine with strawberries and cream and the coconut taste was a little strong. Perhaps alone or with just whipping cream the extra flavor would be more appealing. Thank you for this recipe it is really tasty!!",
