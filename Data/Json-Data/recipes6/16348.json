I followed the recipe as stated except for adding a dash of cinnamon. After cooking the first 2 I spotted oranges on the counter and thought that might be a nice addition. Squeezed 1/2 orange juice and zested a small about and put in the rest of the batter. This is a more time consuming recipe than many others. I think I would use this only on the weekends when it wasn't so early in the morning getting the kids ready for school! They smelled good and were somewhat dense.",
