So I added more veggies like carrots pea pods broccoli water chestnuts onions and baby corn then enhanced the flavor by adding minced ginger root which I think really made the dish not to mention took the emphasis off the nasty-smelling oyster sauce.

Maybe I could have saved this by really dousing it with soy sauce but I just ended up tossing it out. This was not liked at all I will not make this again I'm sorry (:",
