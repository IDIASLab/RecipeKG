The dough was easy to work with (I made it beforehand and chilled it in the fridge until I needed it) and survived a pack of kids armed with cookie cutters. The flavor is superb- the heavy cream adds SO much flavor to these cookies. I substituted a couple of generous shakes of cinnamon (about a tsp.) for the mace. I would suggest whisking the egg in a bowl with the vanilla before adding- I cracked mine into the bowl and the yolk took some mushing up to get it incorporated. This will be THE sugar cookie recipe we use from now on!",

The dough came together alright. When I put it out onto the counter (which had plenty of flour on it) and rolled it out it kept sticking to the rolling pin (that I had also prepared). I rolled what I could and then scraped it up and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Got it back out and it rolled a little bit better. When we went to cut out cookies they wouldn't come up well they did come up as blobs b/c they still stuck to the counter. I ended up using another recipe from King Arthur Flour. Those turned out great. If you do want to use this recipe I might suggest using more flour or less butter.",

Didn't brown but did puff up really nicely I don't like my sugar cookies too thin and crispy and these are the perfect combo of easy to travel but not rock hard. I had help from my 5-year old rolling and cutting and we re-rolled enough times that by the last rolling there was quite a bit of extra flour in there! Still tender and good though. I did skip the icing this time because I had promised we could make paintbrush cookies; before baking paint cookies with a mixture of an egg yolk dash of water and food coloring. Lots of fun but somewhat time consuming good for rainy days! Then sprinkle with a little sugar and bake as usual. Next time I would like to try the icing though. I've never had a cookie recipe ask me to cut in the butter so the texture seemed really weird; I had to work it a bit with my hands and then it rolled out smooth and perfect easy to work with. Thanks for a great recipe!",
