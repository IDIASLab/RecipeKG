I mean, if you order a fillet mignon in a restaurant, would you be happy with any piece of cooked meat? Absolutely not! While this is a tasty sandwich, it is NOT the true Cuban midnight sandwich. Try buying Cuban Bread (most Wal-Mart\u2019s have it on the bakery section) No Italian dressing (use mayo and mustard) No turkey meat (instead use roasted pork), ham, Swiss and pickle slices are OK. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt, pepper and grill until cheese is melted. I always make these on a flat griddle-press so that I don't get grill marks on the bread. Also some people like spreading a bit of butter on one side of the bread and mayo-mustard on the other. Source: Myself. (Cuban/Cook)",

By the way - the mayo mix made enough for 8 sandwiches with plenty to spare.  Knowing this, I may cut that part in half next time. Also - doing the sandwiches on the stove was a pain.  I just put them in the oven (open-faced) for apprx 5-10 minutes and worked out better this way (and more could be done at one time). Still, a wonderful sandwich - authentic or not - that we will be making plenty of times! Thanks!",

FYI-The idea of the foil and plate is to press down the sandwich while it cooks so whatever accomplishes that will do. I used a small frying pan lid to press down. Also, I would recommend you microwave the meat to warm it and take the cheese out ahead so it's not really cold. This will help in the process of cooking the sandwich so that the cheese melts, the meat warms and the bread gets crispy.",
