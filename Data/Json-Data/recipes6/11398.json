We are big peach lovers, but since fresh good peaches are hard to find, I did use the canned sliced peaches (the large can), drained and cut the peach slices in two so the peaches would be in every bite (next time I will probably add another small can of peaches). I took advise from others and made a sauce to pour over the cake after a few minutes of cooling: 1 stk. butter, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 can evaporated milk and I also added a little vanilla flavoring and topped cake with a few pecan halves, which added a nice buttery moist flavor.  My cake was done in 45 minutes.  I always put a shallow cake pan with water in the lower shelf of the oven while the cake is baking.  It adds alot of moisture to the cake and was absolutely delicious.  My husband and I finished the cake off in two days!!!",

Finally I topped the cake with cream cheeze frosting. There's so much cinnamon in the cake it almost tastes like carrot cake especially with the cream chz. frosting on it. It was gobbled up though.
