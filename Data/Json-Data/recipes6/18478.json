Coconut oil is solid at room temp so I just nuked it for about 20 seconds. It added just the right amount of extra coconut flavor. I love the orange zest and the little crunch from the almonds and chew from the coconut. I topped the muffins with sliced almonds and then flaked coconut about half-way through baking time so it wouldn't get too brown.",

First, i added 1 cup coconut milk and no orange juice, and substituted lemon zest for orange. Make sure to add the sugar to the milk mixture so that it is fully mixed through. Also, with the advice of another review, i added 1/2 tsp cardamom and a generous dash of ginger. I also did a teaspoon of coconut extract, 1/2 tsp of almond extract and a dash of vanilla. DO toast the coconut and almonds, it makes all the difference. And, for my healthier preferences, i substituted one cup of whole wheat pastry flour for one cup of the all purpose flour and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the olive oil... i felt the olive oil made the texture extremely heavy. Mix to BARELY moist, and these are absolutely delectable. The best part is that they are Vegan-friendly for my friends.",

Didn't bother to toast the almonds either... Also used nonaluminum baking powder (Rumford's) and extra LIGHT virgin olive oil.
