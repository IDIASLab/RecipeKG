I do a half recipe for 1 whole chicken although I'll be making a big batch of this brine next time and canning it. If you don't have herbs de province you can just use what you have on hand. Sage oregano thyme rosemary any combination of these. I brine the chicken overnight then rinse it out place it atop a celery \"rack\" in a casserole dish stuff it with a couple celery sticks and a few TBSP of butter and roast at 350 until it reaches temp. Baste a couple times during the roasting. The brine also eliminates the need to season the chicken any further it turns out perfect I promise. Not sure how this recipe didn't have more reviews but it's one that's worth memorizing and passing down to your kids and grandkids.",
