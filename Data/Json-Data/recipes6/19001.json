The really nice thing about it is that it lends itself well to all kinds of veggies. I've added snow peas, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions, and it always tastes great. A sprinkling of sliced green onions at the table adds a nice fresh touch, or toasted sesame seeds for a nutty flavour. I've served it over rice and udon noodles with equal success. EDIT: I forgot to mention that I always add some cornstarch to the marinade and pour it into the wok to heat for about a minute, it makes a nice sauce for the stir-fry.",
