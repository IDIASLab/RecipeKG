I used this recipe as a jumping-off point for my own version with green beans wax beans garbanzo beans dark red kidney beans and sliced beets. For the dressing I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (I used \"Sugar in the Raw\") and paired that with 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar (for an extra kick). I added minced garlic and fresh cracked black pepper before giving everything a toss. This salad gets better with time so if you can make it a couple hours before you want to serve it the veggies will marinate in the dressing and it will taste amazing.",
