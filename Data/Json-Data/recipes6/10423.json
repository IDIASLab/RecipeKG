Since this makes 3 loaves, it is a great gift to bring over to neighbors and relatives, also great to freeze and  have on hand.\nI will definetly use only half of the oil, and substitute the rest for unsweetened applesauce since it is 10g fat per slice.  It stays fresh in the fridge for a little over a week.  I had to cook mine for 70-75 min. but that is probably due to my oven.********So I tried this recipe again and put only applesauce and no oil.  The result?  Better!  It is so moist and delicious and healthier!  I have made it this way 10 plus times now and I will never go back to putting oil in it!  \n********This lightened version is: 168 calories, 1 g fat per serving (36 servings).   ",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is becauset the original recipe would have been WAY too sweet with 4 cups of sugar that were called for.  I made it using 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as some other reviewers had suggested. And I think next time I may cut back by 1/2 cup.  I used applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil and thought that worked really nicely. I also recommend upping the spices to at least 2 or 2 1/2 tsp.  Especially the nutmeg!  Overall, a very yummy recipe--It made 2 loaves and 24 good sized muffins for me. (Muffins take about 22-24 min at same temperature).",
