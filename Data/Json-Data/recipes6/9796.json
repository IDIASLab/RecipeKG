Not sure if I will make this again but I sliced it very thin (had to use a wet hot knife to get through it neatly) and spread it out among the gift goodie plates we give for Christmas. When I served some at a Christmas party it was eaten with the candy/Christmas goodies and seemed to be enjoyed - I got several positive comments. The flavor was very sweet - almost a candy cake rather than a fruit cake. Make sure you LOVE coconut before making this as it is a main contributor to the taste and texture.",
