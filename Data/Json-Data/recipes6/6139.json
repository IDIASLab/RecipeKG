They baked up beautifully, are cheesy, moist, and tasty, and excellent for portion control.  Another nice thing about this recipe is that after they cool for a while, you actually can eat them with your hands, knife and fork optional.  These would be great for game day, a buffet table, party food or, of course, dinner.  Thanks kpiper for submitting your recipe, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, and in this house, it\u2019s been delcared a winner!",

I quite liked the wonton wrapper texture - better than traditional noodles. Easy to make but SO SO SO time consuming. Between the cooking of the meat the prepping of the cheese mixture and the layering it took over an hour. Then the 20 min bake time. I didn't bother to cut them into circles just pressed the squares into the muffin tin. Also I doubled the recipe and barely had enough ingredients for 18 muffins - and they were not large. I think tripling the recipe will be enough for 24 which if I am going to spend that much time prepping I want left-overs. Be sure to let them sit in pan like the recipe states. It tastes just as good straight out of the oven but they are runny and sloppy if you don't let them sit and firm up. Watch the video - make recipe from there pausing at each step!",
