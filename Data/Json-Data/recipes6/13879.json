I did add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds to the dressing and decreased the amount of oil to 1/3 cup. I put the dressing in a glass jar and shook it well. I let it sit for about 10 minutes to let the flavors develop. I used sliced almonds instead of cashews and toasted the ramen noodles in a skillet before sprinkling them on top.  I bet rotisserie chicken tossed in would be a great addition too.  Do not add the dressing unitl right before your ready to serve, otherwise it will become soggy. I give this salad my highest recommendation.",

Also, as a diabetic, I cut the sugar down to 1T, and nobody seems to miss it. We're making this at least twice a week now! An entire meal with some grilled chicken tossed in. Many thanks!",

I usually coat the nuts, ramen noodle pieces with melted butter before I toast them and the key to preventing these to burning is to keep turning them while they are in the oven.  I add sesame seeds too.  I also boil the dressing for one minute to make sure the sugar dissolves properly and emulsifies.  Great salad-very versatile and everyone always likes it!",
