My husband and I both have a little bit of a texture issue when it comes to SPAM so my idea was to only blend half of it in with the cheese mixture. I minced the other half of the can and threw it in a skillet and browned it up real nice. The blended spread tasted good on its own but the added texture of the crispy SPAM in the mix really bumped this one up in my opinion. This was a fun little recipe and I plan on making it again the next time we have a food day at work.",
