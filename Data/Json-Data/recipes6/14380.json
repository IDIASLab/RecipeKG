I made the following adjustments due to other comments- added 1/3 cup milk, added 1/4 cup sugar, and decreased vanilla to 1/2 tsp.  I also incorporated the egg yolks and margarine into the milk before adding to the cocoa mixture. I was able to cook the entire 7 minutes without problems.  Thanks for a fast and easy recipe!",

About halfway thru the 4th minute I stopped the microwave because the mix was getting way too thick. It had already thickened beyond pie texture. After I added the eggs vanilla and butter the texture was better. But the second problem was with the flavor. It was very chocolatey but tasted dense. Like maybe too floury. I would make this pie in a pinch but it's nowhere near my favorite.",
