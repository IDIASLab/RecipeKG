You should be able to find it in the international food aisle (not with the mixed drink materials).\n\nCurry paste is much stronger than curry powder -- I'd recommend no more than 1 teaspoon of the curry paste to begin (maybe even less), and then add to taste.  1 tablespoon will knock your taste-buds off!",

It's a good base recipe which you can add to or change, but alone it largely depends on the quality of curry paste (or powder) you use.

I also threw in a handful of raisins.  Simple and satisfying dish over rice.  My two-year old loved it!",

So I just make sure I never run out of these ingredients, and then when someone invites me to a party or potluck dinner, I always have something to make.\n2.) It's vegan, so everyone can eat it, and hearty enough for your vegetarian friends to have something that counts more as a main dish--not just a salad thrown together at the last minute, or spaghetti.\n3.) It's fairly easy to remember: cook the lentils in the broth (I always use broth instead of water) until they're softer than they were but not quite done, add the coconut milk and spices, cook until the lentils are soft, serve. Done and done.\n4.) It's delicious, and it's always been a hit.\n\nIn addition to the vegetable broth I usually add yellow raisins (at the very end--I stir them in once everything is done until they're plump) lemon, cayenne pepper, marjoram, garlic powder, and coriander--all to taste. No exact measurements--its hard to really mess up this recipe.",
