It's so moist and yes just as the title states - it's light as a feather! I used butter flavored shortening and instead of all nutmeg I used 1 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I made this into a dozen cupcakes using a Texas sized muffin tin. I definitely agree that this is best with a buttercream icing so I chose \"Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting\" from this site and replaced some of the cream with real maple syrup for a maple buttercream which gave it a light maple flavor. I piped that over top and then sprinkled a little nutmeg over top. These were so good that I'll most certainly be making these again for the holidays!",

                "reviewBody": "As I looked over the recipe I just knew this was going to be good. First, the combination of butter (for flavor) and shortening (because butter cakes can be dry).  And then the buttermilk - I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a cake recipe that called for it.  As for the nutmeg, it's not that I thought there was anything wrong with using just nutmeg, but I wanted the more balanced flavor of both cinnamon and nutmeg - I used 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and was happy with that ratio.  I baked this as cupcakes, 350 degrees, 18-20 minutes. The title is very appropriate, as these are fluffy and really ARE \"light as a feather\" - no mistaking this for a pound cake or muffin at all! And just as I had suspected, the shortening and buttermilk did make these moist.  I do disagree with the submitter on one point, however.  She suggests this is best with a cream cheese frosting and I think that would be too heavy for this cake. I had some of my vanilla buttercream frosting left over so I just gave it a few good shakes of cinnamon, whipped it up again, and used it on these cupcakes.  It was perfect!  Very nice recipe, and certainly appropriate for this autumn season.",
