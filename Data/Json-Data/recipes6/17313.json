The texture when it hits the tongue is dry- like a cornbread texture. But it seems to melt in the mouth! I would definitely say that this cake needs good frosting though. It was more dry than I expected it to be but not too dry to be enjoyed!",

I made in a bundt pan so baked it an extra 20 minutes which was all the extra time it needed. It's a very light cake and isn't too sweet. I broke it out of the pan as it's very crumbly and apparently I didn't grease the bundt pan well enough. No matter; I just put it back together. Instead of a typical frosting I used the leftover filling I had from making the Blackberry Puff Pastry Tarts as a frosting. I had about half of the filling leftover and although it wouldn't normally be enough to frost a bundt cake I put it on while it was still warm so it could melt over. Then I decorated with some blueberries. Very good that way! thanks for the recipe!",
