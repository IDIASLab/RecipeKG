I added 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar and that was all it needed.  Instant lemon pudding would not taste like lemon to me, it would taste artificial, because it is. So I skipped that and used a fresh, homemade lemon curd instead, \"Microwave Lemon Curd,\" also from this site.  Finally, I used real whipped cream rather than the Cool Whip.  My tastebuds were in heaven - this was goooood.  Creamy, lemony, buttery good. Even Hubs loved it - and the only thing he likes lemon with is fish!",

                "reviewBody": "OK-This recipe has such potential to be better than a five-with slight modifications.  I must agree with the rest - the lemon pudding itself was fake tasting and I too had to add lemon juice and lemon rind to kick it up to a nice lemon taste.  Now in doing that my lemon pudding got a little too runny and didn't set up as nice.  Next time I will add a little less liquid(in the milk/heavy cream) to compensate for the lemon juice.  To make the pudding mix layer itself I did use half heavy cream and half milk-because it makes the pudding soo much more rich and tasty.  I also used  fresh whipped cream (2cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla-whip in chilled bowl with chilled wisk or paddles) instead of cool whip and it was awesome.  This really is such a great little recipe that is soo easy to make with such a nice combination of flavors-cream cheese,lemon and fresh whipped cream.  YUMMY!!  Don't pass it up-just make sure to add either the lemon juice or lemon extract if you have it.",

Every once in a while I add a half of an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip to my cream cheese layer and cut back on my sugar. I also make sure to buy a couple of extra boxes of Lemon Pastry Creams from the Girl Scouts because I crumple a few up to sprinkle over the top of the Cool Whip yummy!",
