Homemade \"pizza\" (actually cheese bread, no red sauce) has become a Sat. lunch or dinner tradition at our house. While I have tried several other pizza crust recipes on this site, this one remains our fav and the one I keep coming back to. The printed recipe card in my recipe box is so worn and tattered that I need to print a new one! I almost have it memorized. Also, wanted to say that 6oz. of liquid is 3/4 of a cup, according to my pampered chef liquid measure. Original review:I love that you can make the dough in the bread machine. I did add a little parmesan cheese as the machine was mixing it, and that helped it come together nicely. I then left it in the frig overnight and make it today for lunch for my boys. I made a cheese bread instead of traditional pizza (my 8yo doesn't like the red sauce).",

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and it still turned out great. I also skipped the kneading by hand and resting. My machine has a \"pizza dough\" cycle so I assumed that would be sufficient which it was. I used a generous amount of olive oil on my hands and the crust when I spread it out to avoid any issues with stickiness as mentioned in another review although the dough didn't appear to be overly sticky to begin with.",

                "reviewBody": "Since I have no bread machine here is how I made the dough by hand. METHOD: Combine 1 1/2 cups flour yeast sugar and salt in a bowl. Mince garlic cloves with olive oil in mini food processor. Add lukewarm water (110 F) and oil/garlic mixture; mix until well blended. Add in the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Turn out on a floured surface adding additional flour if you find it necessary (but not too much.) Knead until smooth and elastic. Grease a bowl with oil put dough ball in bowl turning it over to coat the whole ball with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in warm place to rise for 30 mins. TIP FOR RISING (can use with any yeast dough): Microwave a cup fill 1/4-1/2 with water till it is very hot leave cup of water in microwave and place covered bowl inside close the door. The steam provides a warm environment for the dough to rise. Works for me every time. After dough is finished rising pat into pizza pan (using a bit more flour as necessary) and then I followed the recipe from step 3. MY REVIEW: I did not have bread flour so I used All Purpose flour I used 3 large garlic cloves and it provided an okay amount of garlic flavour. Not overwhelming but not extremely detectable. I minced my garlic in my magic bullet with the olive oil so it would be more well incorporated. I used this as the base for Basic Beef Pizza (recipe on this site) and it was a delicious combination. Would make again. Thanks for sharing!",
