I did a few things differently: I used one more egg and next time I think I may use even more eggs to make it a little more moist (maybe add a little more milk too). I thinly sliced the potatoes and left out the peppers. I used garlic powder and onion powder in the potatoes for a little milder garlic/onion flavor. I only used 8 pieces of bacon which I thought was plenty. I baked it in a 8x8 square pan and added a little more grated cheese after I poured the egg over.
