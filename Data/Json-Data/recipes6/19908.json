This recipe is  reminiscent of the siopao being sold at a very popular resto in the Philippines as compared to the ultra light and fluffy siopao varieties being sold elsewhere.\n\nIncidentally, I gave this recipe only four stars because I didn't like the filling. The dough I give five stars! \n\nNext time, I will just make my own filling.\n\nThank you MCCACJ for posting!",

Also make sure you are precise with your measurement of the flour.  if it is crumbly then there is too much flour.  when you knead in that last 1/2 cup do it a little at a time you may not need it all.  Hope this helps : )",

First of all I make the dough in the breadmaker using all-purpose flour (just a regular white bread recipe). Second I use a combination of ground pork and ground beef and add a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the mixture. I make the meat mixture the night before and refrigerate it because it's much easier to work with when it's cold as well. After assembling the siopao I rise the whole thing one more time (about 45 minutes) before steaming. My siopao turns out just as good as this recipe.",

If your dough is crumbly you add just a bit of water, if it's too sticky you add a bit of flour, it's common sense. Flour is different, humidity is different where you're cooking, this is basic technique. At any rate, while it takes a bit of time I didn't find this recipe difficult in the least. I've been looking for a great rice flour dough recipe to make bao that my celiac husband can have, and this does the trick beautifully. Use the filling listed or go crazy experimenting with your own combos, the possibilities are endless! Imagine sloppy joe filled buns, buffalo chicken buns, BBQ of any variety, chinese veg filled, egg custard, sausage and egg breakfast buns, cheeseburger, pizza flavors, seafood, taco, fruit, chicken pot pie, quiche, spinach dip, the only limit is imagination. This is hands down one of the most versatile recipes you can have in your recipe box, and they freeze well too so make up a few dozen and when you're ready to eat them just steam in a bamboo steamer until they're 165 degrees inside. No more buying buns for crazy prices at the international grocery for us, homemade is WAY better!",
