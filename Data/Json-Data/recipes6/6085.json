Then I tried it and was treated to one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches of my life. Even if you never use these greens to make a grilled cheese sandwich, you should still master this recipe to serve as a side to meat, with pasta, or scrambled into some eggs. This stuff is just shockingly delicious. I served mine with radishes and cornichons.",

This sandwich is delicious I did however, change the bread I used sour dough, and and at first I couldn\u2019t find the lacinato kale so I settled for regular kale and I was just going to mix that with the mustard greens and then I found lacinato or Dino kale at Whole Food Market so I just mixed all the greens together I also added shallots and bacon and I used Muenster cheese. Now that I have something to compare it with I will make the original but nonetheless mine was delicious  even my 10 year old granddaughter loved it.",
