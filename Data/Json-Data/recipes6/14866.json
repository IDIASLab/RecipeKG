I totally skipped dipping the pork in the egg and dredging it - still turned out fantastic and crip!  Not big on green peppers, so I chopped them up fine.  Except for the flavor they added, no one really noticed they were there...  For those of you who looked for \"Tapioca Starch\" and failed - look for \"Tapioca Flour\" instead.  It is actually one and the same!  Bob's Red Mill is the brand I came up with and it is found in most of your health food aisle of your grocery store.  The Tapioca Starch/Flour adds an additional slight sweetness to the recipe.  You can substitute corn starch for this tho'.  Use 1-Tbsp corn starch to every 2-Tbsp Tapioca Starch/Flour.  If you have problems finding \"Plum Sauce\", you can usually find that in the Asian aisle of your grocery store by the other speciality sauces they offer...",

I think one step was missed out, as pointed out by another reviewer - after the water, salt and baking soda mix, dip the pork pieces in beaten egg before drenching in tapioca flour (which, incidentally, is easy to find and fairly cheap in Singapore). The oil will turn cloudy and blacken while deep-frying and I had to change the oil in the wok several times. Oh, and I also recommend halving the amount of plum sauce and vinegar,as well as adding more sugar, as I personally found the sauce a bit too sour/tangy. If you don't have plum sauce, you could use the pineapple juice in the can (if you're using canned pineapples).",

I think you are supposed to beat the egg into the salt, soda, water mixture-then put the pork to it and then drop it in the cornstarch or flour. Don't worry if you don't have tapioca FLOUR, use cornstarch or all-purpose flour (do NOT use regular TAPIOCA it is for making pudding or thickening pies)! I used pork sirloin chops cubed-then fried them til well browned over medium,not high, adjusting the heat accordingly to avoid burning, this takes about 20-30 minutes depending on your heat etc. To make sure they are done cut open one of the larger pieces and check it. I used only pinapple chunks, thinly sliced carrot, and green bell pepper& yellow onion cut in a one inch dice.For extra zip I added some pepper. I did not add tomato, red chili pepper or plum sauce, because I didn't have it on hand and the recipe turned out just fine.",
