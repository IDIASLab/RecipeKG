I did 20-25 minutes I was worried it was too much but I cooled them completely in the refrigerator and they firmed up.) Everyone should be adventurous and try this. It's great! Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "If you are up for something different that blends several unqiue flavors quite well give this salad a try! So good! 20 minutes worked for my fairly unripe bananas (kind of hard to find perfectly green ones) but make sure they cool all the way before mixing everything together or they can get mushy. When I make it again I think I will cut the green peppers into chunks instead of rings and put a little more sugar in - the recipe calls for 1 teaspooon but I would use 2 next time because the vinegar is so tangy. I also used real crabmeat and next time I think I would use artificial because the subtle taste of the real thing got lost in all of the other flavors. Just some thoughts on how I might adjust it - but I would definitely make it again! Delicious and perfect for summer!! Thanks!",
