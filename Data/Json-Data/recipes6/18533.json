Mine were large and fairly sweet as far as crabapples go (I have no idea what variety they were, though)... so it did not jell.  I had to add a box of Certo lite to make it jell.  Once this was done, the flavour was great and the colour was so pretty.... I double-strained the juice, so I did not end up with a \"weird consistency\" like some reviewers said.  Also, I needed a generous 8 cups of apples to get 3 cups of juice - not the four cups promised in the recipe.  All-in-all, I would say that this recipe shows promise, but watch your \"sour factor\" in your apples - make sure it is high.",
