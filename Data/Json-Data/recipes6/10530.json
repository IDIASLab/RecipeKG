My daughter said that they were the best she's ever had. We live in a town with a lot of Czech heritage, so that means something. I ended up using 5 and 3/4 cups of flour, because the dough was so moist, but they were still extremely light and tender\n\nTo prevent burning, I baked them on an insulated cookie sheet. That worked very well. \n\n I also followed the idea of another poster, and turned a dozen of them into \"breakfast\" kolach, with finely chopped onion, kielbasa, eggs and 2% sharp cheddar loosely scrambled. The loose, moist scramble set firm in the kolach baking process.\n\nThis recipe's a keeper. ",

I did not have any lemon when I made my second batch, so I used vanilla in it's place it was still wonderful. I am going to use the dough next weekend for the sausage rolls.
