I've made these so often (because they're that good), with all kinds of variations for the chocolate chips, that I don't even need to refer to the recipe anymore. The reason these are called \"Jumbo,\" however, is because they are supposed to be dropped by 1/4 cupfuls, which produces a beautiful cookie with an entirely different and better texture. Also, use 1/4 cup less all-purpose flour and add 1/2 tsp. salt!",

I made the cake flour by removing 2 TBSP of the flour in that one cup and replacing it with cornstarch, then sifting several times.  When I used milk chocolate chips, I reduced the sugars to 1 cup each, but the semi-sweet got 1 1/4 cups each.  I used 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter and peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips in one batch and in a different batch, I used butterscotch chips and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I could do no wrong with these cookies.  I gave out cookie plates to all my neighbors and they raved over them.  The ones I made for my family were gone long before they had a chance to go stale.  \n\nOne neighbor's comment:  \"These are DUNKIN' COOKIES!\"\n\nGreat recipe!",
