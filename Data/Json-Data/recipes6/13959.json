Didn't expect much, kind of a steamed cabbage/sausage meal, but what a treat it turned out to be! The base recipe is great, but I used a bunch of other reviewers' ideas...I sauteed the onions and garlic in the bacon drippings, then added the other items. Rather than cutting it in quarters, I sliced the cabbage 1/2\" wide, almost shredded. It wilts better that way. I also cubed 4-5 red potatoes, microwaved them to par-cook for 3 minutes, then added them to the pan with the cabbage. I also pan-fried the kielbasa separately to get it nice and browned, then added it for the final 10-15 minutes. The sugar caramelized the onions and cabbage wondefully, the red pepper added that great zingy contrast, and the potatoes brought another texture level. Delightful! I think the cabbage/potatoes/bacon mixture would make a great side dish as well, sans kielbasa. Thank you, Katherine!",

You're right about the potatoes-more people use them in this dish than don't and very few put the caraway seeds in it. I'll tell you a little secret though. One reviewer came close when she said that she tried it with bowtie pasta. This meal is fantastic with kielbasa, cabbage and a bowl of buttered egg noodles on the side with a little salt and pepper. You'll think you've finally reached seventh heaven it's so tasty and filling. Real comfort food here.",

I did add 1 large baking potato cut into cubes to the cabbage mix, after I boiled the potato separately for about 15 minutes.  I also sauteed the sausage in a separate skillet to keep them from getting soggy and that boiled taste once in the cabbage.  Also, I only used 1 1/2 tsp of caraway seeds and it came out excellent!  3 tsp is way too much!  I topped each dish off with a dollop of sour cream and it blended the flavors of all the ingredients perfectly!  It was truly yummy!  Thanks!",

Everything else remained the same... right down to the caraway seeds....  I understand the desire to cut back/down/eliminate certain things.... but I don't feel that one should judge and rate the recipe from their dietary soapbox... if it is too fatty for you, move along...
