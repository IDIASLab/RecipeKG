                "reviewBody": "With a yellow cake, the taste and texture are very nice.  The icing has a mildly crispy meringue shell and adds moisture to the cake especially if kept unrefrigerated.  \n\nThe seven minutes the title purports is totally inaccurate.  It took at LEAST 20 minutes with my hand mixer before the meringue got to the soft peak stage.   \n\nAs for the act of frosting, that can be a bit challenging.  This icing is a bit thin for my liking.  I ended up with icing all over my counter.  This frosting is just not very effective for layered cakes, as it just oozes out from between the layers.  This may have been avoided if allowed to completely dry before adding another layer.  Try fresh berries instead.  \n\nIt takes quite a few (four or more) hours to completely set.  I would have been building this cake for a few days had I gone by that method.  The drying time (for lack of a better term) also prohibits stencils from being used effectively.   \n\nTo the credit of this icing, it DOES taste GREAT and contains much less fat and calories than a butter-cream type of frosting.  Making this recipe is a challenging, but rewarding experience.  Seven minute frosting complimented the yellow cake from King Arthur Four's Baker's Companion very nicely indeed.  ",

As another reviewer, it probably took at least 30 minutes over the boiling double boiler with the mixer. If it isn't thick enough, keep cooking. I took it off and thought I could beat it thicker, and then put it back over the boiling water until it was thick, then just beat it until it was cool enough to ice the cake. This icing is exactly what my mom used to make, lots of great memories eating the cake!",
