I used cherry which worked fine but I am sure it would have been even better with cranberry. Also I was in a hurry to get this thing in the fridge before going to church so I just threw it all together in a bowl. It turned out great. I don't think the added initial chilling is necessary nor the additional step of pouring into 13x9 dish. Perhaps it just creates a more interesting presentation or something.",

I modified mine a little I used cherry jello and add one extra pack of jello 2- 14 oz. cans of whole cranberry sauce extra 1/2 cup of sugar and 20oz. of Mandarin slices drained instead of oranges. I mixed my jello sugar and hot water in the dish I was serving until jello dissolved and then added remaining ingredients and then refrigerated until ready to serve. It does taste better the longer it sets. I made mine 5 days before servings. Thanks Valorie for sharing this wonderful recipe!!! New family favorite.",
