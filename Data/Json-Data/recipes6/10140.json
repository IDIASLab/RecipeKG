This was fantastic! Every direction and amount was perfect! True 5-star. I did need to add about 1/3-1/2 cup more chicken stock, but that was it. I would strongly encourage folks to try this. It's rare on All Recipes to find a submission that doesn't need any changes, but Creamy Lemon Chicken Pasta is it.",

When it got to the Parmesan cheese, I only had the shaker kind (and I assume the recipe means shredded) so I used that bc it\u2019s what I had. Then, instead of baking, I just spooned the veggies and sauce on top of the drained pasta. I thought it was very good, even without chicken! Hubby however- loves meat more than veggies and thinks it was good but would be better with chicken. Lol",
