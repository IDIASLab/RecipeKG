I thought it made a lot of chutney--think that part could have been cut in half. (I've been trying to find ways to use up the leftover chutney--I was surprised to find it's really tasty just mixed with some plain yogurt; also good mixed in chicken salad.) My husband who is sensitive to smells didn't like the strong vinegar smell of the chutney cooking. The chutney tasted fine though not too vinegar-y. It was a little tart though so I added orange juice and apple sauce to sweeten it up. I put the pork in a brine of water salt and sugar for about an hour and a half before I cooked it--not sure how much it helped but the pork was pretty tender. I think I prefer a simpler pork--I found the very strong taste of the chutney overpowered the meat but that's probably a personal preference.",
