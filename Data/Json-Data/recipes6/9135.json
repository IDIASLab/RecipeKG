I whipped this up out of ingredients I had on hand. They thanked me profusely. Now I have a new dish to use. It's pretty rich in flavor, but not so high in fat (depending on what kind of ingredients you use). Enjoy!",

I didn't want to open my block of cream cheese for just one tablespoon, so I used 2% fat Greek yogurt instead of the cream cheese.  Unfortunately I am out of panko crumbs so I had to use regular.  I only had to bake about 25 minutes- I think the time listed is too long.  Watch it carefully, as you really don't want to overcook salmon.  We had broccoli, steamed rice, and sliced avocado with this.  Loved it!",

You do have to cut back on the cooking time, though.  400 degrees for 25 minutes was PERFECT!  ",
