You will get 12 servings (at 3/4 cup per serving) or 9 (1 cup) servings. I track my food so I had to portion this out which is how I got these amounts. Secondly this really is quite sweet. I halved the brown sugar (only change I made) and it was still plenty sweet for me so you might want to start with a smaller amount. I served this over zucchini noodles. The mustard and celery salt really add some depth of flavor. Thanks for sharing grandma's recipe!",
