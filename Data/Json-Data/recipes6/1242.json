Before marinating I pierced the roast all over with a large 2-pronged meat fork. I added a little salt to the marinade and marinated for 48 hours. Since we live at a high altitude (6500 feet) I cooked it on high for half the time and then switched to low. Of course I let it rest for about 15 minutes before slicing for the juices to distribute. It was surprisingly tasty even to my husband's and my palate which are used to much more spices in the cooking. Our friend loved it and my husband asked me to make it again giving it a 4 rating.",
