They did spread a bit more than I would of preferred, so next time I think I would try refrigerating the dough before baking. I made a half batch (got 18 cookies out of it), used Bailey's in place of Kahlua (personal preference), and used dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. They baked perfectly in 12 minutes, and benefited from staying on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes after baking to set up a bit. Thank you for the recipe!",
