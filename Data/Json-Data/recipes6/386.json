                "reviewBody": "Here are some things I've learned while making these caramel apples. 1. If the caramel is not sticking properly, you need to heat caramel up again to 248.  The caramel will stick perfectly until it starts to cool then the butter separates and it will not stick.  It really is useful working with a candy thermometer because you can monitor the temperature closely. With one of the batches I overheated the caramel when reheating and it turned into hard toffee.  2. Placing apples in the boiling water made them seep juice, will try them without following that step the next time.  I had many extra apples and kept them near a cool door, that made the caramel hard but once it was placed in a warm room they started to soften again.  Definitely worth trying, flavor is far superior compared to store purchased caramels.  Also, it is useful to have a helper hold dipped apples upright to cool a moment before placing on parchment otherwise you will have the hot caramel puddle.",

I rarely try recipes that have so few reviews, but this was definitely worth the try! Thank you for the great recipe!",

I think I over cooked the caramel just a tad - I did not have a candy thermometer! But I used a knife and cut slices and it was every bit as delicious and not as messy!

I found this recipe last year and the caramel tastes exactly the same. I had to figure out how to get the right technique down to get a nicely covered apple but I have it down. Once the caramel is done let it sit for about 5 minutes then use room temperature apples and roll the apple for about 10 seconds in the caramel and then pull it out of the caramel and let the caramel come off and roll it a bit. Place the apple on sugared parchment paper if you are making plain caramel apples. AWESOME...just made them tonight (first batch of the season) and the kids loved it!",
