Just picked some habanero and jalape\u00f1os from the garden so I googled a recipe and decided to go with this one. After reading the reviews I decided to switch things up. I added 2 cups of apple cider vinegar instead of 4 and 1 cup of water as hubby hates an overpowering vinegar taste and from the other reviews it sounded like 4 cups was too much for our liking. Chopped up the 2 habanero and 1 jalape\u00f1os and minced it in the processor then dumped it in the pot. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 2.  Substituted ketchup with tomato paste because I was worried the sauce wouldn't thicken up. Everything else stayed the same. The sauce is better than I anticipated and adds an amazing kick to our pulled pork. Hubby said it was a tad bit too vinegary still but he got over it and thought it was delicious regardless.  Will definitely be making this again!",

This is even BETTER than their wing sauce...but we did make modifications. We cut the recipe into 1/3 b/c we didn't want that much sauce. Then we doubled the amount of brown sugar as well as ketchup...and we did NOT add any cayenne power mostly b/c we did not have any. Oh and we used black pepper again it is what we had on hand. We put it on wings that we grilled and put Lotta Bull BBQ seasoning on as they grilled then tossed in the sauce. They were out of this world! My hubby suggested we only use 1/2 of a habanero next time if we are making it for others b/c we like hot food and it wasn't uncomfortable but certainly noticeable in terms of hot on our lips after we ate. My hubby said a MUST make again. Delicious!",
