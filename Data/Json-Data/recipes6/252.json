Served it with New Year's rice recipe on this site, great together. \nUpdate: I've made this in the crock pot  with  cut large chunks of pork tenderloin (they shrink half the size). I used fresh pineapple chunks, about two cups, and also cut up a half sweet  onion, saving the green onion as topping after cooked. Added in a small chopped red and green bell pepper. Used a bit more Mae Ploy Sweet chili sauce, like 1/4 cup, instead of Sriracha . Cooked on low for six hours in the crock pot. Meat was tender melt in your mouth. The sauce was so tasty with all the juice of fruit and peppers. Adding in a tablespoon of corn starch before cooking kept it at just the right consistency. Served over rice.",
