I just worked with what I had on hand..I only had two small peppers from my garden and a couple cans of diced tomatoes in my pantry...so I just diced up the peppers and olives to make them go farther and pureed the diced tomatoes. These are the only two things that I did different and it turned out excellent!! Oh yah...I also added about a 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to make it a little thicker...Awesome stuff!! Its definitely worth repeating!!",
