But once I started using this recipe I have never had a problem with them setting up. I do use evaporated milk in mine an most of the time I use creamy peanut butter. Every once in a while I will add i cup chopped pecans and/or 1/2 cup coconut to this recipe. You can cook for about 20 seconds longer but i minute should be perfect. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! For thr oatmeal if you use anything but the quick cooking (1 minute kind) they will not taste right. The rolled oats will make them tough with a cardboard taste. Rolled oats are great but just not for these cookies.",
