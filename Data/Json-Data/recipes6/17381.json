I used 2 cups chopped dates and a half cup raisins.  I boiled the fruit in 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup orange juice with some cinnamon.  When I added the baking soda it had a mini lava effect like a science fair project (I didn't think about the acid from the orange juice and baking soda, oops), but not enough to be a mess, and it didn't ruin the flavor.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and I also added nuts to the cake. I messed up the topping the first time I made it (adding the cream to the hot butter wasn't pretty) so I just did a topping of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Anyway, my whole family loved this recipe.  They said they would buy it in a coffee shop.  I didn't think it was that pretty, so if I made it for company I would increase the recipe and make it in a bundt pan, or slice it like a loaf cake and serve with sauce and whipped cream.",
