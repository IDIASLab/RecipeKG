However, we use melted butter/margarine (1 cube melted) instead of the sour cream and we scale the raisins down to approximately 3/4 to 1 cup; we dip the knife into the flour and then make our 'X'. We don't put seeds in ours. This was the first recipe that my cousins and I were taught to make when we were young girls, or 'wee ones' as our Grandmother called us. For some strange reason, the best bonnets (Great grandma said that they weren't loaves but \"bonnets of bread\") seemed to come from my mother's oven...an old Wedgewood. Now they come from my kitchen...I have an 'old Wedgewood' now.\r\n",

Instead of 3 cups of raisins used 1 cup raisins, 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup chopped dried apricots.

I did use only 2 cups of raisins (1/2 golden & 1/2 regular) and 1 tsp of caraway seeds.  I don't care for caraway seeds but had to have some for authenticity.",

I used only 1 cup of raisins and it was enough for me but my boyfriend thought 2 would have been better.  3 cups would be way too much!!  We both agreed the flour on top was yucky.
