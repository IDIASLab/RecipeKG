The flavor is so bright and shiny and the texture is great. I will definitely make it again:) The one thing is I can't decide what it IS- is it a breakfast drink? Dessert? Snack? Whatever it is it's very yummy and right up your alley if you're a lover of orange things! I think the reviewer below me must have accidentally used a tablespoon of vanilla extract or is really sensitive to vanilla flavor or something because the vanilla is not at all overpowering. I'm not a fan of the vanilla-orange-cream flavor combo usually (an orange flavored medicine I had to take as a child completely turned me off to all things Creamsicle) and I think it's just dandy in this recipe. The dominant flavor is definitely orange and the vanilla just adds a little something subtle.",
