He loved it, and so did everyone else!  (I accidently poured in the whole cup of sour milk that I had prepared, and it still turned out to be perfect!)  \r\nI added chocolate chips (as others suggested), and I topped it with the \"Banana Cream Frosting\" (another \"allrecipes.com\" recipe; see my review for that too).

I added 2 tsp. cinnamon and frosted it with a double batch of \"Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing\" from this site. I would have liked to have made a cream cheese icing for this cake, but didn't have any cream cheese. I get the best results when making homeade cake by making sure to really beat the butter and sugar well (medium speed for at least 2 minutes). I then added the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Then I added the bananas. Add the milk and flour mixture alternately just until incorporated. I baked them for about 23 minutes. To make the sour milk, I put 3/4 Tbsp. vinegar in a measuring cup and added milk to make 3/4 cup. I highly recommend this recipe!",
