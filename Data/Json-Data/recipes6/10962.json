In her original recipe, Emma Rylander Lane calls for a full wine glass of whiskey or brandy - the REAL THING.  My mother and I have always included at least a half-cup of liquor to the filling.  In our opinion, if you're not going to add the liquor (unless for a child's birthday, of course), you shouldn't even bother.",

It does take an eternity to make properly, but it's worth it.  I froze my cake layers for about two hours and then removed them and filled them AND frosted them with the same filling, instead of cream frosting.  I believe the original recipe used the filling to frost and fill the cake.  It makes an amazing Christmas presentation.  It's very difficult to make the frosting stay on the cake, but freezing the cakes and chilling the frosting for an hour or so makes it easier.  I used my hands to pat the frosting on and then placed the cake in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning, I removed the cake and patted more frosting on the \"bald spots.\"  I also use a half cup of brandy, instead of brandy extract.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  I work with a lot of southerners and they were all so excited when I brought the cake in for Christmas.  Everyone loved it!",
