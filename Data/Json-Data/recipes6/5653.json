This was mild not spicy. It was very very good and it was a great alternative for my kiddos. We did have to add extra water because there wasn't any liquids to help cook with the potatoes and in fact it took longer to cook the potatoes for that reason. When reheated most of the juice factor is gone but that's okay I opened up a small can of green chili enchilada sauce and added to the stew and it was totally awesome as a reheat dish.

I salvaged it by adding 1 c. beef stock (only started with two cups of water for fear it would be too liquidy) and added a lot of cumin salt and pepper. Next time I'll be sure to season the ground beef better and use all beef broth instead of water. It's worth trying but needs more flavor which you can add it to suit your tastes.
