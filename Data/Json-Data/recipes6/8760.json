Making them into sliders on lightly toasted sourdough is an amazing gourmet treat for guests! My boyfriend got out the ketchup, and after one bite of these burgers he put the ketchup away. These burgers are perfect as-is--you don't even need buns!",

Since the burgers had goat cheese in them, I didn\u2019t add any cheese on top (only caramelized onion), and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because you really taste the goat cheese.  They were super tender, moist, and just delicious.  I rarely fool around with adding a bunch of ingredients when making burgers (typically grilling), but these were really good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
