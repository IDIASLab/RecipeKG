I dice onions and peppers saute' them with minced garlic. I don't use as much garlic powder maybe half or less than what is called for. For cheese I'll use whatever I have on hand. The sauce is great and I add a squirt of sirracha. I also broil it for the last 5 minutes just to crust it all up. Great flexible recipe. My wife loves it and I do too.",
