Overall this is wonderful recipe and I think works best with plums that are not completely soft. I used a potatoe peeler to peel these them and it helped alot. Okay my experience with this is you can't get it wrong. On a whim I decided to make this I didn't have enought honey so I added a some sugar. Didn't have enought sugar so I used splenda for baking for part of it and didn't have walnuts so I used pecans and the batter was dry so I added another egg and a little bit of milk to make the right consistency for bread(yes it was a cook on the whim because i wanted to but didn't want to go to the store). This bread came out wonderful moist in the middle and the sweetness &tartness of the plums was a nice touch. Very good and as you can see hard to mess up LOL",
