I have even used it on beef and hamburgers, sausages, hot dogs, or anything you want, for the most part.  I use it on everything from ribs to roasts to hamburgers to hot dogs. Even goes good with a good old classic grilled cheese sandwich. This is a great all-round BBQ sauce. Use right away or cool to room temperature, transfer to jars or containers, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months in the fridge.",

It's not as sweet as so many BBQ sauces are just a very rich taste. The red chili pepper flavor mellows over time and although it was not too strong for us to begin with it was much less noticeable the second day. It is very easy to make and will be my new go to recipe for BBQ sauce. I used about a cup to cook a pork shoulder roast in the crock pot along with a sliced onion and diluted orange juice and then topped the pork with the sauce when served. Yummy! Looking forward to trying it with chicken and so many other dishes.",
