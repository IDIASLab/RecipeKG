I followed the recipe but missed the splitting of the Italian salad dressing so just used the marinade in the making of the sauce. It did make it a little lumpy though. I found the fiddleheads too crunchy - especially since I am trying to convince family members to eat them. Next time I think I will steam them for at least 5 minutes instead of boiling them for two. The sauce was nice. Also although it didn t say to in the recipe after starting to fry the chicken breasts I decided to cut them into smaller pieces so they were easier to manage. Made the serving more presentable too. Had some rice on the side and some partridgeberry sauce (similar to cranberry). Lovely meal but family not convinced yet!??",
