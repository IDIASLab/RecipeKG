Good, as always.----UPDATE 4.24.14---Used this recipe\u2019s standard sauce ingredients, but I substituted Johnsonville\u00ae Italian Hot Sausage links for the wieners.  I did brown the slices on both sides in a non-stick skillet and then they went into the sauce.  The first bite gives you a sweet saucy taste, then the spiciness kicks in with the sausage.  Maybe an unlikely combination of ingredients, but these flavors partner well, and they all disappeared VERY quickly.  Just another, totally different option.",
