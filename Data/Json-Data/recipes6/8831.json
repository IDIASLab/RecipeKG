                "reviewBody": "This may have just become my favorite green bean recipe of all time. I absolutely loved these. I will mention a couple of things. I found that the larger more plump green beans worked better. The smaller ones seemed to get lost in the breading and the green bean flavor didn't come through. For a pound of green beans, plan on two large baking sheets instead of one. Lastly, I think there is room for improvement on one thing. The bottom of the fries get nice and brown due to them sitting on the foil with the nonstick spray. The tops however stay pretty chalky like. When I make these next time I will definitely give the tops a spray to get a nice golden brown all over. Coating one bean at a time is tedious but well worth it in the end.",
