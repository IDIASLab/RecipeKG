I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter (instead of oil) and 1 (6 ox) container of yogurt (same flavor as pie filling used), 1 1/2 cups freash fruit added to the pie filling.  So for Blueberry Pied Cake I use blueberry yogurt and 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries and I onit the cinnamon.  For Cherry Pie Cake, cheery yogurt and fresh or frozen cherries and I omit the cinnamon and use almond extract instead of vanilla.  Strawberry Pie Cake is delicious too!  You get the idea.  This is a very versatile recipe and that's why I like it! I get rave reviews every time I've served my version of Pie Cake.  It's great for breakfast or dessert!",

I used a store brand blueberry flavor and the filling itself was rather bland (I tasted a little out of the can after I made the recipe). Maybe the extra fruit pie filling would be a better choice. Also blueberry makes an unappetizing color of batter so I decided at the last minute to use a streusel topping to cover up the gray color. I would recommend using a topping and the optional nuts to make this cake more interesting. It came out a little too moist even baking it for a full 60 minutes. This was good my teenager liked it but not my favorite.",
