On the bone keeps the chicken moist and while messy makes a good meal.",

                "reviewBody": "this is a really interesting tasting recipe.  Tastes slightly like Indian, slightly Chinese chicken.  The addition of the rosewater added a high note.  Subbed nutmeg for mace, and also added a piece of the orange rind for a more intense orange flavor.  It seemed a shame to let the fruit go to waste so I processed the entire thing in my foodprocessor (only tossed out the rind)to get more intensity from the clove and peppercorn.  On its own, the sauce does not have a great flavor but somehow when added to the chicken, it was a really great taste so don't give up until you've tried the final product.  I rarely make a dish without onion or garlic so I did saute 2 cloves of garlic and 1 med. onion halved and sliced along with the chicken and am glad I did; it added to the overall flavor of the dish.  Served this over rice for a really nice different way to make chicken in a snap!  This makes a quick weeknight meal with a different way to jazz up chicken breasts.  Don't forget to add some salt.",
