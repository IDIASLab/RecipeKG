I bake the mix in my large muffin top pan which allows me to make them perfectly round and control the thickness, it also makes them the perfect size to put in the toaster. In some I add garlic powder, black pepper and sesame seeds, others I just add the sesame seeds. It tastes WONDERFUL, is super easy to make, holds together perfectly and (I am a diabetic) has drastically dropped my blood sugar since I have replaced any bread that I use to eat with this bread.

I may try thinning it with some water next time to see if I can make it a little easier to spread. I can't wait to try it as a sandwich bun tomorrow!",
