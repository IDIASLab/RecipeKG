First, turn the oven temp down about 10 degrees.  Second, don't soften the butter before mixing, just cut it into 1 tbsp pieces and mix with the sugar.  Third, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the dough.  Finally, once you've filled the thumbprints with jam, put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking.  The first time I followed the recipe and my cookies were so flat the jam leaked through the bottom, and the second time I made these adjustments and the cookies not only tasted delicious, they looked perfect, too!",

They turned out flat as a pancake, so I'm attributing the cause to the switch in the extracts because I made a third batch, like the first (with the almond extract) and they were perfect.  Also followed another reviewer's advice and used a chapstick end to make the hole. These are delicious and attractive IF you follow the recipe exactly.",

                "reviewBody": "I've made these cookies a half-dozen times now. They've been DELICIOUS every single time, but here's a few words of advice: First, do not leave out the almond extract or sub it with vanilla. The almond adds a great flavor and its very distinct. Second, pull the cookies out of the oven midway through cooking, take a spoon and lightly spread the jam outwards and even it out into a circle. This way, the cookies will look much prettier when done. The first time I made them, the jam had bubbled all over the cookie and wasn't evenly spread. The flavor was the same of course but the jam likes to go its own direction and I like them to look pretty. Great recipe!\n\nETA: I have found that once the cookies are ready to be put in the oven, if you put them in the fridge for ~15 minutes, it will eliminate the need to \"fix\" the jam half-way through baking. Also, because shortbread is naturally so white, it is easy to burn these without realizing that the bottoms are browning. So, carefully watch the edges and when they turn light brown, they are done (even if they don't look like it!) Also, use the back of a teaspoon to make perfect little holes to fill.",

Although... it did take 3 tries in the oven before I figured out how to eliminate the jam from spreading all over my cookie sheets and creating a mess! (even the messy looking cookies tasted great though) I should have listened to other reviews... In the end... I made the cookies like small little buttons - about the size of a quarter rolled them into a ball like another reviewer and then made a nice indent for the jam. You don't need a lot of jam... when you use too much the jam will destroy your cookie sheets... suggestion for novice bakers like me... use parchment paper the first few rounds so you don't have to deal with the mess in the event you don't use the right amount of jam or push the indent enough to hold the jam... Anyhow I baked the really small cookies for only 12 1/2 minutes and they turned out fabulously. Each oven is different though... that much I've learned... so I started to look for golden brown edges and then pulled the cookies out.... makes for a tasty shortbread cookie! even my husband who is a die-hard chocolate chip cookie lover and told me \"i don't like sugar/shortbread type cookies\"... well... he has managed to eat close to a dozen of the little button cookies in the past few hours!",

Although I typically never bake with margarine - I was surprised at how well it worked for this recipe.  Although the recipe works as stated - I've found a way to \"improve\" it a bit.  \n\nBy adding 2 egg yolks and 2 extra tablespoons of flour - it creates a tastier cake-like cookie.  The trick is to beat the butter by itself until the butter is very pale - then add the sugar and beat again until very very pale.  Add the eggs and flavoring - then add the flour.\n\nI don't use extract because I don't use any alcohol - I have found an almond emulsion for bakers (alcohol free and much better than extracts) and these cookies are PHENOMENAL with the almond flavoring.  Vanilla works well too - but the almond is the best!  \n\nOf all the cookies I bake these are the most requested cookies.  \n\nI use a cookie scoop to have even sized cookies - shape them into round balls and only use my thumb to make the indentation.  Fill a plastic ziplock bag with the preserves and snip the corner of the bag - and pipe the preserves into the center of the cookie (less fuss and mess)... if you have any extra preserves you can just squeeze it back into the jar.  Be sure to use parchment paper, rotate half way through baking, and remove from oven when the bottoms begin to brown (the tops of the cookie shouldn't brown).",
