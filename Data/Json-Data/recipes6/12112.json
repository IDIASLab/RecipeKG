First got it but unnamed from a local aussie paper more than 10 years ago then discovered it's got a name (1st or 2nd name above) last 4 years or so via the Net. Recently here (malaysia) it's making its rounds again but under yet another name - Famous Amos lol. No matter what name it goes around with this chocolate oatmeal chip cookie deserves a try; so go on you might just come to love it especially if you love oats with nuts and chocolate. This makes a lot; I make them smaller and halve the recipe sometimes too. Thanks for sharing it here Holly I now know the calories and fat content of these cookies.",

Also someone noted this was the Mrs. Field recipe. Mrs. Field's has stated they do not use oats/oat flour in their chocolate chip cookies and I cannot taste oats in those cookies. They have stated that their recipes use more butter and vanilla than the average home recipe along with more sugar.",

I know it's terrible but I use margarine instead of butter which really help the texture. I don't bother grating the chocolate. I just throw some extra milk chocolate chips in the blender and mix that in (and I add more chocolate than it calls for). In the end though underbaking these cookies is really the key for me. I bake them for 6 minutes and let them cool as short a time as possible on the cookie sheet. People continually beg me to make them and I've sold a few batches. By the way you can make these vegan and they are still fantastic! The texture is different and you have to form them into a cookie (they don't spread out) but the taste is still incredible. My vegan friends said they were the best cookie they had ever tasted.",
