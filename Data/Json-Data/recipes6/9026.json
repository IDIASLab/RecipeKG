I used Guinness as the type of craft stout suggested was unavailable. I didn't do the quick soak in addition to the overnight soak. I just did overnight soak. For first half of cooking time, the slow cooker was on high, last part I turned it down to low. The beans were done in about 7 hours. I would like to try this in a Dutch oven, in the oven next time to see how they turn out. Delicious beans!",

For the beer, I used Oddside Ales' Bluegrass Breakfast Stout (brewed with coffee, maple syrup, bacon and pecans). YUM! The only issue I had was the cook time.  I let the beans soak for 9 hours (longer than stated) and after 5 hours in the slow cooker on HIGH (recipe states LOW), they weren't even close to softening up and they should have by that point bc of the HIGH setting. I transferred everything to a large dutch oven and put it in the oven at 275F, which took an additional 4 hours.  Next time I'll just use the oven for the full cook time.  Not sure what the issue was, I even bought beans that same day, as older beans can take longer to cook.  This paired exceptionally well with smoked brisket and jalapeno cornbread! I'll definitely make this again!",
