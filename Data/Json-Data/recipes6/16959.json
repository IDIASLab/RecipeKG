I had both Coffee Liqueur and Creme de Cocoa so I put the creme de cocoa in the cake and used the coffee liqueur for the sauce. Also with the sauce I think I just used all liqueur and no water (it's been that kind of week) and I was running very low on margarine/butter so I used Cream of Coconut I had on hand. FABULOUS CAKE!! I was worried my cake would stick to my obstinate bundt pan so I dusted the pan with sugar. The result of everything including the sugar dusting was a wonderfully sauced cake a lightly crunchy coating drool worthy sauce (what didn't soak into the cake making it super moist) a great texture and a cake that holds itself together. It was a little rich but then again my makeshift ingredients were sweeter than called for. At any rate this is a new staple!!!",

Made this for a book club Christmas Party and it was a hit. Next time I will try using cold coffee in stead of water in the cake mix. Sauce / syrup was delicious addition and made the cake.",

First, this recipe must have been written before the sizes of the cake mix and pudding have decreased.  Due to this, I put a slightly lower amount of oil and water into the mix.  Next, the cake tasted a lot like a straight box cake.  I had hoped the extra ingredients would have made it taste more homemade.  Finally, there was so much sauce and I could not get the cake to absorb much of it in the center (even with the holes).  The sauce ended up being a mostly messy greasy liquid around the cake plate.",
