Couldn't find gingerbread cake mix so I used the spice cake as another user suggested. I made it the day before serving which probably wasn't a great idea since the topping soaked into the cake and made it soggy. To cover that mess up I made another batch of the syrup-sugar-butter mixture and thickened it with cornstarch heated it and poured it over the whole thing before serving. It was definitely the hit of the night... Highly recommend the additional thickened topping even if yours comes out great to start with. That put it over the top. Thanks for the recipe. I will probably make again but will likely thicken the original sauce as well. Merry Christmas!",
