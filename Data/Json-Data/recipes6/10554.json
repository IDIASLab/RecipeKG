It just needs a little tweeking.\r\nAt my mothers suggestion, I substituted a product called \"vanillina\" powder for the vanilla extract. This is available in small packets and you will need 3 or 4 of them. This will produce the missing \"aroma\" that was mentioned in a previous review.\r\nIt does rise too high in the machine so I always pull off a lump after the second rise ( a bit smaller than a tennis ball) and discard it or bake it in the oven as a small bun.\r\nI used dried (or candied) mixed peel as the fruit along with some golden raisins. This is what you often find in store bought panettone",

Upddate: made this bread again today. This time reduced yeast to 1 1/2 tsp, upped the sugar to 1/4 cup, reduced the salt to 1 tsp. Added 2 tsp vanilla  and almond extract.  Added 1 cup mixed fruit(golden raisins and mixed dried peel).  These changes now make it a 5 star authentic Italian panettone. Spoken by a 100% Italian person.",
