I found that very disappointing. Given the name you'd expect to taste both coffee and chocolate in the cookie but you don't - and if you don't what's the point of adding it? I don't believe this cookie would have tasted any differently had I omitted both the coffee liqueur (Kahlua) and the chocolate syrup. Still I can find no fault in the cookie itself which bakes up nicely and holds its shape. Can't help it tho' - there is nothing to distinguish this from other chocolate chip cookies so it won't be something that will stand out in my memory.",
