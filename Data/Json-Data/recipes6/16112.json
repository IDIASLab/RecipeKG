Cook to no more than 234 degrees - if if cooks at higher temperatures, it will be very stiff and somewhat grainy.\n\n2.  It is very important to let the fudge cool in the pan to no more than 120 degrees, 110 is better.  Just leave the candy thermometer in to check this.  This cooling process takes at least an hour, so allow extra time.\n\n3.  For an even smoother fudge, add 2-4 Tbs of cream as you are beating the fudge.  This will make the fudge easier to slice.\n\n4.  Beat for at least 3 minutes with a good quality hand mixer.  It will not look like it has set up when you put it in the pan, but put the pan in the fridge and a few hours later, it will be set.\n\nI don't usually go to this amount of trouble, but the flavor of this recipe is so good, it was worth it - and even with their flaws, eating the trial batches was very tasty.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe will take considerable restraint on my part to NOT EAT THE WHOLE BATCH in one sitting it's so good! Fantastic brown sugar taste with a creamy, smooth and buttery texture. I followed the recipe exactly except skipped the nuts and it turned out perfect.  A couple key things for someone new to candy/fudge making: make sure you don't stir it AT ALL after it comes to a boil and until it's cooled off - take it off the heat and don't touch it.  Otherwise, if you stir while it's boiling or while it's cooling off, you'll start the crystallization too early and it'll end up horribly grainy and even separate.  I use a candy thermometer and take it up to 234 exactly (as other reviewers do)  then let it cool off to 110 without touching it. I then use a hand mixer and beat it on medium-high until it is creamy and really starting to thicken up (consistency pretty thick where you can see the tracks/ribbons from the mixer but still pourable - once at this point it'll firm up quick if you keep beating and you'll have to scrape it out of the pan).  And I know it's a silly detail but I always move the pan around on the counter every minute or so to constantly give it a cooler surface underneath so it sets up a bit quicker although it still took me about 10 minutes today with the mixer.   Thanks for the great recipe!",

I poured the penuche into a clean mixing bowl without scraping the sides of the pan to cool. I added 3 Tbsp's of butter to the top of the hot mixture without stirring it in as it cooled to 110F. When cool I added the vanilla and beat the mixture by hand until it was thick enough to spread and frosted the cake. I used what I needed for the cake and continued to beat what was leftover and scraped it into a buttered mini loaf pan to set up as fudge. It set-up perfectly. Excellent flavor and creamy smooth texture. Will definately make this again. NOTE: regarding graininess..Any implement you put into the candy while cooking but remove and set aside has to be completely cleaned of any sugar from a previous dip into the boiling candy or it will cause the entire batch to start to crystalize and become grainy or sugary. When you remove a spoon or whisk rinse it well and dry it before using it again. There should be enough time between uses to clean and dry it.. Just sayin!",
