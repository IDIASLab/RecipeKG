It seemed liked 3/4 of a cup was quite a bit of brown sugar for this recipe so I started with 1/2 cup and that was plenty sweet for our taste. I thought the bacon made the beans a little greasy and personally we didn't like the texture of the bacon mixed into the beans. It was a little too soft and chewy. We prefer the bacon put on top of the beans so it gets a little crisp. The BBQ sauce did give the beans a nice tang though! Great idea!",
