I did use organic flour and eggs and half butter/half margerine. The cooking time was not right for me. 375* was way too hot and they burned fast but 350* for 10 minutes was perfect. All three of my men LOVED these cookies and my husband remarked that the cheesecake pudding was a really good addition. I thought this was a particularly pretty looking cookie. I would recommend that you chill the dough for an hour or two so it has time to firm up a bit and let the cookies firm up on the cookie sheet before taking them off so they don't fall apart. NOTE: Half gone since this morning. OMG, huge hit!",

I added a bunch of hangerson..M&M's choc. swirl chips choc. chips and raisins to equal the two cups. I had a French Vanilla mix. I did add 1/2 tsp. salt which I think helped with what others complained of the blandness problem. Very nice soft cookie for a change of pace w/a bit of crispness. 9 minutes on a teflon sheet was perfect.",

I only had chocolate pudding so that is what I used. I also had about a 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips left over so I threw those in with the 2 cups of chocolate chips. The only thing I was confused about was the 3.4 oz box of pudding. Maybe because I used fat free sugar free pudding the size was different but I had both small (1.4 oz) and large (2.1 oz) boxes. So to be safe I threw both in. In response to the reviewer that felt the cookies had a chemical taste maybe it had to do with the type of pudding they used. I was afraid of this since I used the fat free sugar free variety but I detected no strange after taste. The cookies do not spread much and frankly my daughter and I had fun making them.",
