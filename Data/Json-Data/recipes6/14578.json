Thanks to previous reviewers, I cut the oil by half (next time maybe even a little bit more), added 1/4 cup chopped red onions and 1/4 cup sliced almonds.

This salad is always a crowd favorite, and it's always requested at potlucks and dinners.  I always add a few strawberries to the dressing and let it sit in the fridge to cool for an hour or so before serving.  The dressing ends up a beautiful pink color and the strawberries really dress it up!  It's a nice way to bring back summer if you can find strawberries out of season in your grocery store, and goes well with just about any meal you could possibly think of.",
