I wasn't able to start serving at that point though and just kept it on the lowest setting I could and stirred it constantly. It was about 10 minutes from the point that it started boiling that I was able to serve it. The sauce was a little thicker than I would have preferred. It was a little filmy but that was my fault. I substituted white vinegar for tarragon vinegar and added 1/8 t. salt and 1/8 t. lemon pepper seasoning. The flavor was wonderful. I served this over broiled tilapia and steamed snap peas. It was outstanding over the peas. It was a little overpowering for the tilapia but I am going to try it over a heartier fish like salmon or mahi next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
