I kept wondering why it was taking so long for the cream to cook down and potatoes to start to brown after the foil came off, and then it hit me\u2026I\u2019d cooked it at 350\u00baF instead of 400\u00baF.  Now that\u2019s my fault, not the recipe\u2019s!  Not to worry, it still ended up tasting absolutely delicious and absolutely DECADENT (which it is!), it just took a little longer.  I would describe this as somewhere between au gratin and scalloped potatoes.  This certainly is a nutritional splurge for a side dish, but we all deserve a little treat occasionally.  Still don\u2019t quite understand the layering, but bottom line, it ended up tasting good, so I\u2019ll make it the same way again.  Julie, thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a good one.",

One layer of onion, bacon, potatoes, dry soup mix, cheese and some cream;  start the second layer and layer exactly as you did for the first - onion, bacon, potato, dry soup mix, cheese, cream.  I was able to add a third layer.  Only change was to reverse the order of the cream and cheese for the final layer.  Use the rest of the cream and ended with the cheese.  I think the previous reviewer misunderstood the layering process and though some ingredients just were done for the first layer",
