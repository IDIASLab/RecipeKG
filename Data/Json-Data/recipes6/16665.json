I did not have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c shortening with no adverse effect to the cookies. I also split the recipe in half before adding the candy-coated milk chocolate pieces. In half I added raisins and walnuts and in the other half I added the candy-coated milk chocolate pieces and walnuts. Both cookies were fabulous! The cookie dough tasted great also!",

I used all vanilla and decided to fill the rest of the cup with the candies with pecans and raisins. I also didn't have any butter-shortening so I put in a little butter for flavor and regular shortening. Boy these turned out so yummy!! I will definitely use this recipe again as I know you can add almost any combination of things to the mix and it will come out yummy. Thanks Ellen the kids nephews grandma and myself couldn't wait to pop them in our mouths after they got out of the oven! enjoy!",

My blend actually was clumpy so I put in the blender & it made a fine powdered sugar like texture. Used 1/3 cup of that blend 1/3 cup of more Splenda & 1/3 cup of regular brown sugar. Used Whole Wheat Pastry Flour less oats because mine are Organic Old Fashioned. Found Dark Choco M&M's after Christmas on clearance used less that the cup. Hubbie was so happy! I learned on the Splenda site to cook at a lower temp these were perfect at 350 for 9 minutes. Thanks again!",
