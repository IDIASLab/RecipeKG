I patted the *dough* out in the pan and crossed my fingers.  I then made the topping which I added walnuts to. The topping was a little wet and formed clumps rather than small crumbs.  I broke it us and spread it out evenly on top.  I thought it might sink but the cake batter was too dense for that.  I was pleasantly surprised that the cake baked up nice and doubled in size. The cake texture is not dry nor is it crumbly.  It is a soft cake and very moist.  We really liked the addition of the nuts in the topping and I also added a sugar drizzle.  The cake is not overly sweet which I liked but the sugar glaze was needed.  Nice flavor - you can taste sweet potato and I will be making this again.",
