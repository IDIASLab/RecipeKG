However he RAVED about this and told me to give it five stars. I made no changes to the recipe and even though some reviewers said it was 'bland' neither my husband or I like particularly hot dishes so I kept the chili powder as is - it was PERFECT. I only had one pound of meat but it was fine. And I dumped the whole thing in the crock pot and cooked on low for the afternoon. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!",

Next time I will do the green pepper that way too! I had already chopped it by hand & thrown in the pot- it was fine this way anyway. I did saute' the veggies in a little olive oil then added the meat. The only other thing: it was too mild- & I'm a wuss! So next time I will add more chili powder.
