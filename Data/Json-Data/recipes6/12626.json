I actually baked mine at 350 for eleven minutes--the reason for the longer cooking time was because I really packed my small cookie scoop to make bigger sized cookies which meant they needed a touch longer bake time. They turned out soft chewy and were loved by my husband and two kids. Next time I will try this with Reese's pieces and maybe half peanut butter in place of some of the shortening.",

I like the use of shortening rather than all butter in this recipe for the sturdiness it imparts but wanting the best of both worlds I used half of each. Going into this I knew this would be a moister softer cookie just by virtue of the fact that there is a higher ratio of brown sugar to white sugar. Because I like my cookies crunchier I knew this would not be MY favorite but I know this texture appeals to most and that s what it delivered. These are indeed soft and tender but chewy at the same time. I had mini M & M s in the pantry so I correspondingly made the cookies smaller too. As I do with all my cookies containing butter I chilled the dough for about an hour before I baked them. These cheery two-bite cuties will be well-liked at Hubs meeting tomorrow morning.",
