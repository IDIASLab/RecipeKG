So, when I made this, I left the sugar out of the crust, as the cookies are sweet enough already, and the sugar is what caused the crust to burn for some people.  Also, I used a package of cream cheese instead of the can of evaporated milk, so that it would not be soggy.  Finally, I have found from experience, that if I ever use any number but 3 eggs when a pie requires them, that I will be sorry, so I made it with 3.  It turned out phenomenal!  The crust was crispy and sticky like candy, and buttery too.  The combination of ginger and pumpkin was just so wonderful, it took me right back to my childhood and made me feel all euphoric and happy.",

I also add 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and substitute cloves for the nutmeg. My husband loves this too. He commented that the top tastes just a regular pumpkin pie but that the crust is so much more flavorful. Well I'm off to make one!",

Would do that again! One tip is to pour the filling almost all the way to the edge that way not so much crust is showing (the molasses in the cookies makes the crust look burned although it isn't).

The first time I made this I mistakenly bought pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin so I used the recipe on the Libby's can. Baking time was right on for this mixture to set and the crust really adds some zip to counter what I think is the bland mushiness of pumpkin filling. I'm still not wild about pumpkin pie but I happily finished my slice. I would give four stars for the crust alone but the second time we used the filling recipe here. As one reviewer pointed out it did not look set. I let it bake about 15 minutes longer but unfortunately the extra time scorched the entire crust. When I make this again I will follow that reviewer's advice to use the baking time suggested and let the pie completely set out of the oven. Or I'll just use the Libby's mixture again. The crumb crust takes up more room in the pan than a regular pie crust and this recipe makes three times the amount of filling needed for one non-deep-dish 9-inch pie. Next time I will either increase the crust recipe or decrease the filling amount. Given the issue with the filling setting I wouldn't recommend using a deep-dish pan.",
