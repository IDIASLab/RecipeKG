If you can't get blue corn posole or hominy feel free to substitute White or yellow corn hominy (NOT hominy grits though). I didn't use the squash or Eggplant instead I added strips of cabbage at the very end for texture and I added a fair amount of cumin and a squeeze of lime juice - which is more in the mexican style. If I can find blue corn posole I'll try it with the squash - I bet the colours would be as ravishing as this beautiful dish. I use pork shoulder in this and put it in at the beginning before the Posole after a couple of hours you should have a nice broth and the pork will shred easily with a fork. The add the Pozole and continue to cook. Some places in Mexico sear the meat first and then add all the ingredients to make a kind of braising sauce - in that case just simmer the whole thing and use stock insetad of water.",
