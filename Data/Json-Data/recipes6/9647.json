I made it a bit more quick and dirty (and more like a corn salad): steamed the corn in the microwave, dumped the hot corn over the other veggies and butter, let sit for a few minutes to soften the veg and melt the butter, added the spices, and stirred to combine.  Used green onions.  Thanks for the inspiration.",

I think the only thing I did differently was season my veggies with some garlic salt pinch of pepper(Cajun seasoning is spicy enough) and added about a cup of quinoa which I thought completed it! I will most likely make again as it was super simple and it's one of those where you can throw veggies in that you're trying to get rid of.
