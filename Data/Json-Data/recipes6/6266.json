My husband makes his own version that is very similar to this recipe (using a little of this and that)...and I wanted to replicate it. Suprisingly enough this came very close to his. I used dry herbs and threw in some cilantro and green onions. I used a bit more salt than what the recipe called for and used ground pork rather than lamb. I've never cooked with lamb before...simply because I never see it at our grocery store. I was given several compliments and plan on making this again. Thanks for sharing Alan.",

My family gave it 5 stars even the kids. Will serve this often this coming summer. Thanks for the great recipe.",
