I usually have to saute spaghetti squash after roasting it in the oven because the strands always seem a tad too crunchy for me. It was the perfect texture for our liking using the instant pot. I did not have fresh rosemary on hand and subbed with a little dried rosemary very lightly sprinkling into each shell. I used this recipe to go with Chicken Cacciatore for the Instant Pot by Bren. If you're new to the IP like me see the pictures from the recipe author Fioa to see how to place the halved spaghetti squash into the pot. I have a LUX 60 and used the steam option for the same amount of time called for in this recipe and it was perfect for us. Will be making this again! Thank you for sharing the recipe!",
