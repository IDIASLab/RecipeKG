To make the dumplings come out a little more tender and delicious add a little less than 1T more lard or shortening and zest some lemon rind into the dry ingredients before adding the milk. Then only stir the milk in until the dry ingredients are moist- don't stir and stir. Thanks for the delicious recipe.",
