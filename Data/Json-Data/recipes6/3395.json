Bake in a 9 x 13 pan. I would have liked the sauce thicker and the larger baking dish could have helped. At 30 minutes my large chicken breasts were no where near cooked. I had to cover them crank it to 400 degrees and cook another 10-15 minutes. Smaller chicken breasts would have fixed that. I sliced the chicken on the plate and poured the sauce over the chicken. A nice fall meal. Would make again. Very impressive with great flavors!",

I used a cast iron frying pan so I would not have had to dirty up two dishes. It needed a lesser cooking time. Next time I make it I will reduce the sauce before baking it and take about 5 minutes off the cooking time. I made it with Calamata olives instead of Spanish olives (I don't usually eat Spanish olives).",
