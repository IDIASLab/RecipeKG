I did not prepare the pan as it wasn't indicated to do so and I do know that with this type of \"no-fat\" cake greasing or greasing and flouring the pan isn't generally done as it could affect the rise. I used a shortcake pan and the little cakes stuck miserably. I was at least able to salvage the top halves. The recipe I have always used with the butter doesn't direct to prepare the pan either but I believe that because of the little bit of butter in the batter that's not necessary. I actually prefer the recipe with the butter anyway - I like both the texture and the mouthfeel better. If I was to make this recipe again especially with this individual shortcake pan I'd grease and flour the pans. What little bit of rise I might sacrifice would be worth having the cakes release easily and intact. Same day update: I was compelled to make these again for several reasons sheer stubbornness one of them. But the truth be told if Doughgirl made them with success there had to be something I needed to do differently. (I admire and respect her expertise!) Finally unless I wanted to serve my guests with botched sponge cakes (my mother would say \"Who cares what they look like they're delicious!) I either had to buy an angel food cake or...bite the bullet and try this again. This time I greased and floured my pan - complete success!",
