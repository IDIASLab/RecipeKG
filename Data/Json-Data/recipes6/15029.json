I used two 29-oz cans of cut sweet potatoes instead of cooking my own.  I substitued evaporated milk for the regular milk and I think it made it more creamy.  I used dark brown sugar for the white sugar and I cut that back to 3/4 cup since others said 1 cup made it too sweet.  I upped the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I was going to add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. salt to the mixture but I forgot until it was too late.  But I did manage to get a sprinkling of cinnamon on the casserole before I put the topping on.  I made a double batch of the topping and baked it all in a 9 x 13 pan.  It was fantastic!",

I tried it a few days before Thanksgiving and even my husband (who will never eat sweet potatoes) asked for me to make again it for Thanksgiving dinner!!!

I made a few adjustments the second time I made it and it was even better.  1.) used 1/3 cup evaporated milk instead of regular  2) seasoned potato mixture with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.",

I use real maple syrup instead of white sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes and don't use flour in the topping. You may want to double the topping. Very yummy. Tastes great warmed up but doesn't look as pretty. You can make it ahead of time but keep the topping separate until ready to bake.",

We always have it during the holidays and even our daughters in-laws ask her to bring it. The only difference I noticed is that I usually use canned sweet potatoes (one large and one small) this way it is always on hand. Also, I place the pecans on top first then add the flour, brown sugar mixture on top. I melt the margarine and drizzle on top of this mixture. Does not need to completely cover as it will flow over areas not covered as it cooks. It is a receipe that I have had for about 30 years from my mother-in-law and now my daughter makes it also for her in-laws. It is great!!!!",

Be sure to use a shallow baking dish as it will take much longer to bake if you don't. Great recipe and Thanks!",

My father is a big major food critic in our family and he loved it.  My mom is a sweet potato lover and will basically eat them just plainly baked.  My family never really had this before so it was great new addition.  Since we have American additions to our family through marriage we had to tweak our Christmas dinner.  This recipe is awesome & the kids love it!  I am a new lover of sweet potatoes & I wanted to try to make a casserole so I did this receipe.  It turned out great however the pecan streusal was way too much so next time I think I will half it and use it sparingly, I also think this would just be great with the marshmallows on top or even by itself.  But the marshmallows is always good presentation.  I also used a half cup of sugar which was plenty of sugar for it and I used a tad bit more of vanilla.  I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.  The sweet potato part was creamy, perfectly sweetened with the half cup of sugar and it was fluffy and light.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!",

I buy 5-7 sweet potatoes depending on size and am usually in the 4 1/2 -5 1/2 cup range in the end.  I highly recommend giving this one a try! \r\n",
