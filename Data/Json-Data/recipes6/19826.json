If you have never made a Texas Sheet cake, do not be scared by the consistency of the batter, it WILL bake up correctly. Be sure and use the 10x15 pan, it's supposed to be flat. I didn't have the ingredients for the icing in this recipe so I used this one. Bring 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup peanut butter, and 6 tb milk to a boil in a large saucepan. Add 1 tsp  vanilla. Mix in 1 box (3 3/4 cups) powdered sugar. Mix well, beating with handheld electric mixer for smoothest consistency. Frost cake while frosting is hot and cake is warm. Finally, I drizzled lines of warmed hot fudge topping over the icing. Once the hot fudge cools it firms up so don't substitute with chocolate syrup. For me, the chocolate adds a lot somehow.",

Because so many reviewers commented that the peanut butter flavor was somewhat subtle, a couple even saying the cake was bland, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't be peanut buttery enough for my taste, but it was. I did add just a sprinkle of salt to the icing to draw out the flavor a bit, as I used unsalted butter. I will definitely make this again as a simple way to satisfy a PB cake craving!",

The cake is a little on the oily side has a dense crumb and doesn't pack the peanut butter flavor I hoped for. The frosting recipe didn't appeal to me so I made my own peanut butter buttercream frosting. The cake might be improved by reducing the amount of oil a little and replacing it with the same amount of peanut butter and by using brown sugar rather than white. I'll still keep looking for the school cafeteria peanut butter sheet cake I remember from my school days.",

So I made my first ever pb sheet cake. The frosting is amazing. It makes the cake. Upon first bite I was slightly disappointed as the cake does seem a bit bland (though o-so-moist!). My tastebuds caught up and the frosting took over. I think if the cake were any sweeter or any more peanut buttery I'd be in a peanut butter coma. Both textures of cake and frosting are perfect. I did use all butter instead of butter and oil and I doubled the icing. Everything else was the same. Great stuff! ETA: It's even better the next day!",

The other inconsistency I have is that the texture can be oily (sometimes more than others). What I've learned is this: 1) You can't over bake it. It's a moist moist cake! 2) Regardless of how it turns out peanut butter lovers LOVE it! I've never had to toss one out because people refused to eat it.",
