I wasn't too sure about having just the peanut butter brownie so I layered it with a chocolate brownie (I really liked this one: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Katrinas-Best-Ever-Chocolate-Brownies/Detail.aspx) and layered them both in two pans. The cook time that worked for me was around 25 minutes at 335 degrees. The peanut butter layer was more the texture of a soft cookie but it worked wonderfully. After it was done I added the toppings of this recipe as called for. If you love peanut butter and chocolate I have no doubt you will love this.",
