Especially since shortening is very unhealthy - if these tasted great, I wouldn't care, but I try to make sure the taste is worth the health effects!  Used 1/3 cup b.s. and 2/3 white; 2 bananas; did not make frosting, just sprinkled hot chocolate mix over top, which was good.  If you want thick bars, use a 9x9 pan - this goes fairly thin in a 9x13.  But, I suggest you make Mocha Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins, Banana Cake VI (a real winner), or Banana Chocolate Chip Cookies from this site instead.",

Having to change it this much means it is basically a different recipe entirely which is why I gave this particular version 2 stars, the new and improved version would definitely be a 5.\n   I used 3 small bananas in the bars, I added an egg, I cut back to sugar to 2/3 of a cup, no salt, no lemon juice, no walnuts although they would be nice, my preference is pecans which would also be good. They baked at 350 for 20 minutes.\nThe frosting IMO is too much, just too sweet and not really necessary with the great banana taste of the bars themselves. So I frosted first, then scraped most of it off, leaving a very thin almost glaze like covering, which is how they will be made next time.",

The bars came out great, I suspect they are fluffier than the original recipe with the help of the egg.  I will definately make them again & again!  Thanks for the inspiration!",

I had 1% milk only so I added about 3 tablespoons of sour cream to the milk making it measure about one cup. You could probably use all sour cream. I had no shortening which has no flavor anyway so I used Land o Lakes buttery Spread. Not the best choice but it creamed fine. Butter flavored shortening would be good in this I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is all I had. Last of all I used two small ripened banana which ended up being about one and half after removing the ends and dark spots. They were ripe but not to ripe. They had plenty of texture and firmness to them. I smashed them by hand. LOL. I think these would be great with just a dusting of powdered sugar too. Some ideas for icings: browned butter cream cheese peanut butter (small amount to the frosting recipe given) chocolate Any combination They are cooking up very nicely. I suspect they will be great as the raw mixture was wonderful. Enjoy!",
