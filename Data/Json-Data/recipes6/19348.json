That is 3 separate batches not all on one! Get creative but keep the filling thin or it will ooze and stick. Glad I have an easy place to find this now instead of digging through my index card recipes!",

I think the filling overpowered the dough a little but still delicious. Might try it again with a lighter preserve like an orange or lemon. I also wonder if the dough could be used for savory recipes since it contains no sugar? Might have to experiment with that. Also: Would be fun to make with kids if you dont mind washing sticky fingers afterward. The construction part is like making little pizzas. Very enjoyable.",
