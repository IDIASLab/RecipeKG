My machine has 3 rise cycles so I take the dough out just as it goes into the 3rd rise and form it in breadpan. Let rise again and bake as above. Done in about 2hrs with no problems. I do use about 3 cups of flour and probably a 1/4 tsp more yeast. I make this about every other day and my daughters hover around the oven waiting for their treat.",
