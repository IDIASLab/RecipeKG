The only thing I changed was to double the amount of crumb topping, I just didn't think it was enough, it didn't cover the entire top of the pie.  We warmed each slice in the microwave for 35 seconds and topped with Cool Whip--excellent!!  My other apple pie recipes will be deleted from my recipe box!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!",

I also, based on other reviews, increase the flour in the filling mix to eliminate runniness. I had made this pie for a friend, but my dear husband refused to let it leave the house! Smelled so wonderful he could not resist. Cool completely before slicing! I know it is hard...you can also zap it in the microwave to serve with vanilla ice cream!",

This is one of the best apple pies I've tried in some time. I don't normally make a crumb topped pie so this was a nice departure. Because hubs and I wouldn't be able to eat a whole pie before the topping became soggy I scaled this down to three servings to make two individual pies in shallow round ramekins. I used \"Butter Flaky Pie Crust \" also from this site. I skipped the raisins and nuts and subbed an equal amount of cinnamon for the nutmeg which I'm not a fan of. The apples are perfectly sweetened and spiced (use more or less depending on the sweetness or tartness of your apples) with a perfect amount of rich cinnamony syrup - just enough to mix with the apples. The crumb topping is light and \"crumbly \" just as it's supposed to be (a recent baking experience showed me that's not always the case). And just the right amount of topping too. Not only is this one of the better recipes I've tried it's also one of the easiest with no top crust! This would make a terrific presentation for a dinner get-together as these individual little pies are very charming. I definitely have another favorite with this pie!",

I had baked it as directed just before the meal and it cooled for about an hour and a half and was still warm when I served it. I'm pretty sure I didn't forget to put the flour into the filling (but it's possible). Later, after all the guests were gone, I picked up the pie plate and the juices had thickened upon standing. So I think I may have to let it cool completely before serving next time, and maybe bake it uncovered longer.",

The Cool Whip on top sort of saved it, but I'll know better for next time.........UPDATE: The next day the pie was incredible. I don't know what happened.  I still think doubling the topping was a mistake, but boy was it good the next day.",
