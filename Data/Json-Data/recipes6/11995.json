Mine ended up being more of a sweet biscuit -- would be great dough for scones! Would have probably been wonderful if I'd used the right flour. The texture is great -- the sour cream makes the difference. I'll definitely try them again -- the right way next time!",

The only downfall this cookie has is the lack of sweetness. But otherwise it is soft melts in your mouth mmm mmm. It's a good thing the frosting I made compensated for the lack of sweetness in the cookie itself. I also made this dough ahead of time maybe a few weeks ahead. Rolled it into a log wrapped it tightly in wax paper and stored in a ziplock bag. I thawed it 3/4 way before I started working with it. Very good dough very good cookie. I will try this recipe again and probably put more sugar in next time. Thanks for Sharing!",
