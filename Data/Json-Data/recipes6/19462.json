I am going to add some cubed tofu in the next time...I am sure it will make a great main dish!  :) Thanks!",

I questioned rather I should blanch or steam the beans for about 2-3 minutes before adding to the wok. I should have followed my instincts and done so. I cooked the beans in the wok for 4-5 minutes with the first cooking and another 2 minutes with the second cooking. They were still pretty crunchy (raw kind of crunchy not good cooked kind of crunchy). The flavor was wonderful and the cooking method was easy to follow but I will par cook the beans when I make them again. I served these with Take The Night Off Slower Cooker Pineapple Chicken and white rice. We enjoyed a delicious meal and I would make both recipes again.",
