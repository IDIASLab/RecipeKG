Lastly, I didn't want to deal with the messiness of the squash halves - I was in a hurry - so I peeled and cubed the squash, and baked everything together. Cubing increased surface area of the squash, decreasing the bake time, and made it easier to eat in my mind...a better mixing of the flavors. My partner topped his with parmeasan and I ate mine with plain yogurt.",

However I just couldn't add all the turmeric. I thought about an 1/8 tsp. was plenty. Any other seasoning suggestions? Curry was good too.",
