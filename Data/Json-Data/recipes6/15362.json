How many? 2? 4? 10? Then it says to cut these logs into 1 inch slices in an irregular shape. What sort of shape? Octagonal? Trapezoid? or does it mean to cut on the diagonal as in biscotti? I rolled the dough into 2 logs about 12 inches long. Then I sliced it into one inch slices on the diagonal. This gave me 17 biscuit/cookies. Anyone who manages to get 48 pieces from this recipe has my admiration. The pieces would be microscopic if I did it. These came out tasting pretty good but I am rating this recipe 2 stars due to the inexact instructions........Aug 22nd I had to re-think my rating of this recipe. Even though I still think the instructions are ambiguous the cookies are strangely addicting. My husband and I can't stop eating them. Will definitely make these again. Soon.",

Next time I'll add a little red food coloring. I agree with other reviewers that the instructions were vague. I ended up rolling the dough into 3 logs and then sliced it kind of like small biscotti. I got about 36 biscuits out of it. When these finished cooking at 30 minutes I took one out of the oven and tried it. That was a mistake. They really need to stay in the oven to cool to get that crispness on the outside. Don't eat them until they are completely cool -- they don't taste very good when they are warm. After sitting in a tin all night they were quite good today and made a great afternoon snack. I'll be taking a few with me for lunch every day -- they make a nice complement to soup salad and chicken or tuna salad. It's a nice change from bread or dry crackers.",

The biscuits are very dense-don't use these if you're looking for something fluffy. I used the egg white on half of them but it picked up far more sesame seeds than the amount called for so I stopped coating them and it worked fine. I only ended up with about 20 biscuits but that could easily be my fault. The dough was slightly difficult to roll into logs for cutting. Yet overall they are a mellow tasty and filling treat.",
