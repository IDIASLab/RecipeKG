If prepared as written this is a pureed soup that wouldn't have appealed to me nearly as much.  It's incredible to me what a robustly flavorful soup can be had so easily, in so short a time and with so few, basic ingredients.  The bacon, garlic, red peppers and thyme each have a signicant contribution and all the flavors meld so well, including the odd Worcestershire sauce!  I had some chopped rotisserie chicken in the freezer that I tossed in at the end - really delicious (especially if you don't puree the whole potful)!",

As I was cooking it I was thinking that there were a lot of vegetables in there and when I added the beans and saw the ratio I was worried that the veggies would overpower the beans' taste. But it came out wonderful: the tastes blend so well that you actually can't pick out any of their individual flavours. After blending the soup gets a wonderful babyfood-like quality that makes it so very comforting. When it was over I was wishing I could lick the bowl clean - a 5 star indicator!",
