I didn't have the baking squares so I substituted with about 10 tbs. of baking cocoa (supposed to be 12 but it's all I had left, it was enough, though), and with 4 tbs. of veg. oil. I also added about 1 and 1/2 tsp. vanilla and sprinkled some cinnamon in the batter as well. I baked at 325 degrees. It was moist, which seems harder to find, to me, in a homemade cake , and it sure did rise nicely! The whole family loved it and was told by my daughter that this is her favorite cake recipe so far. I believe I'll just stick with this one! Thanks Sue!!",

I used an 8x8 square glass pan which could be why I needed the extra time.  This was freaking delicious.  A keeper for sure! \n I also made icing.\n**3 tbsp butter, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, pinch of salt, a bit of homemade vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 1/2 tbsp unsweetened vanilla almond milk ( its just my milk choice, I'm sure any milk is fine).**\nMelt chocolate and butter, mix in vanilla and salt, mix in powdered sugar and milk.  Beat on low-medium speed for at least 5 minutes, 10 is better.  Spread over warm cake.",
