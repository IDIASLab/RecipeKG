I've been using the same one for years, with just a few variations: (1) For a slightly more moist and chewy cookie, use butter in place of the shortening (no, they do not come out flat this way - they maintain their shape perfectly). The flavor of the butter also helps take the taste of these cookies to a whole new level!! (2) Bake them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, pull them out of the oven and put the kisses on them, then put them back in the oven for 1.5 to 2 additional minutes. If you do this, the chocolate takes on a new, slightly softer texture once it cools. It still hardens, but not QUITE as hard; and it suits the cookies much better when it's time for eating. Whether you take my advice or follow the posted recipe, I urge you to try these cookies. You won't be disappointed! This is THE classic Peanut Butter Blossoms recipe, and everyone you feed them to will love them :)",

Actually my friend and myself ate these cookies and did not feel very good afterwards.  These did not leave a warm full feeling, but instead a disturbing very sugary unsettling feeling....we couldn't eat anything the rest of the day.  Perhaps it was because they actually were quite tasty and we ate 24...and then we burned some and ate those too...:-)  Thanks for the fun recipe",
