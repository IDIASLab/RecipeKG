I altered the recipe slightly with the following substitutions:\n\n3tbsp vegan butter margarine -> 3tbsp virgin coconut oil,\n1 cup sugar -> 1/2 cup evaporated cane juice,\n3/4 cup cocoa powder -> 1/2 cup cacao powder + 1/4 cup cocoa powder,\n1/2 cup agave nectar -> 1/2 cup rice malt syrup.\n\nI think the original recipe calls for too much sugar, considering agave is sweeter than cane sugar I highly recommend reducing the sugar to 1/2-3/4 cup. \nI drizzled chocolate melted with coconut oil over the top and it went all crispy! You can't tell this recipe is gluten free and when I was looking for a brownie recipe I wanted to use the two flours (almond and brown rice) in the recipe so it worked out perfectly! So pleased.",

The consistency is perfect - just like most people are expecting from the traditional brownies. However, the cocoa flavor was a bit too strong for my husband's prefeeence; there is a slight bitter after taste. That can easily be remedied on the next batch. This was my first time substituting for eggs and I didn't have chia meal - but I knew from my reading that flax meal would work so that is what I used.  and it worked great!  Because my 8x8 pan was in use, I decided to make these into the mini-muffin tins and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes. I let them cool for just about 10 minutes then gently scooped them out with a soft plastic fork so as not to break them. (Hard to get out once they are totally cooked). Made about 3 dozen. The guys at work will devour them.",

I would like to substitute the almond meal for almond flour. I had to add another TBSP water to get it to mix in the bowl. I think the original recipe needs to be tweaked to get the best result",
