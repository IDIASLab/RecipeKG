Also, I added 1/2 tsp salt to the dry ingredients. The cake was HUGE, moist & smelled wonderful when baking.  I made the 1st cake with pecans & it was delicious.  I made the 2nd cake without pecans and topped the slightly warm cake with a caramel frosting which dripped down the sides. YUMMY! (Caramel frosting: melt 1/2 stick real butter over low heat; add 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup milk; heat until almost boiling.  Remove from heat and cool 10 min.  Add 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Beat in 2 cups sifted confectioners sugar until smooth.  Cool 5 minutes and spoon on warm cake).  Thanks for a great recipe.",

Also, it's very important to add sugar very slowly.  Take 5-7 minutes to add.    Add eggs one at a time and beat until just blended.  Don't over beat eggs!  Your cake will overflow if you do.\n\nI baked mine in a metal bundt pan for 70 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I added: 1/2 tsp salt to dry ingredients; to the egg& sugar mixture I also added: 1 tsp of \"vanilla butter&nut extract\" (it's by mccormick and in most stores) 1 tsp of lemon zest (helps balance out all the sweetness) and substituted half&half instead of milk. I ground the pecans in the food processor untill they were fine but not dust or paste about 20 sec maybe; folded them in at the end. For a glaze I did: 6 tbl butter 3 tbl corn syrup 1/2 tsp lemon zest 1/4 c brown sugar. Cooked over med heat for until well combined and butter is completely melted. Off heat add: 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp of the vanilla butter extract and 1 cup of finely chopped pecans. It should resemble the topping for a sticky bun thick and gooey. Spoon over the top of the cake when still warm. It is very sweet and decadent dessert that is fabulous for company. I sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar around the plate when I served it. It was beautiful and scrumptous and everyone loved it! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!!",

Without this addition - I doubt I would have a received the high approval rating from my family that it did. Tastes similar to a sugar cookie but too plain for me (very unusual!).
