Even meat chicken or sausage might do the trick. I followed recipe just doing 1 less can of beans. I might see if I can save this by turning it into a soup or something else. It did make quite a bit for just 2 of us. Having had a meal plan in college I am surprised this was served in the cafeteria at the dorms. 20 years ago we paid 800 1000 a month for a meal plan. I would have been pretty displeased if the main dish was cooked white rice and a can of beans.",

Also add 1 can of tomatos (or fresh diced or Rotel) reserving juice. I add the juice then top off with the veggie stock in a measuring cup. Along with Cajun seasoning adding some smoked paprika, or liquid smoke to taste, Mrs. dash and a bay leave. I will also use brown rice, for added nutrition. Increase liquids a half cup  and cooking 10-15 minutes if using brown rice. Finish dish with salt, pepper, squeeze of lime, and/or some chopped parsley or cilantro to add freshness to dish",

If you roast the rice in the pan you are using to cook it in, the starch is converted and not such a problem for the blood sugar.  This also makes the rice fluffy so I do it for all rice dishes except Japanese where you might like sticky rice.  You could use minute rice or Uncle Ben's otherwise but I like to convert our own rice.   Hubby hates beans.  His mom served them all the time because there were 9 children and a small budget.  I would love this recipe but I think I will make it with the barracho (drunken beans made with beer) beans which are a little spicy.",
