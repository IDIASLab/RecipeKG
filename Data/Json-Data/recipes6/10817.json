I used the butter/applesauce option and also traded the sour cream for vanilla yogurt, and used the 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar combo. I really liked the way this turned out--really good flavor and a moist, spongy texture. I'm not a fan of crumbly, dry coffee cake, so I will keep making it this way. Next time I think I'll add a drizzled icing. Thanks for all of the suggestions--you all are helping me become a better baker!",

I omitted the nuts and mixed the cinnamon with brown sugar instead of white. Before putting the cinnamon sugar on top I creamed 1/4 cup cream cheese with a teaspoon sugar and a splash of milk. I dropped it in blobs all over the top of the cake and used a knife to swirl it around. Then I put on the rest of the cinnamon sugar and topped it with a little extra brown sugar. I used an 8x8 pan and baked it for 35 minutes. Delicious!",
