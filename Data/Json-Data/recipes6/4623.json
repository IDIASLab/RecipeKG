This was very delicious and was a healthier bow to the typical Thanksgiving main course. Hints & suggestions - Puff pastry at my local market comes frozen. Plan ahead - place it in the fridge 24 hrs. before you need it (I did not try the \"quick thaw\" method so I cannot tell you if this dries it out. It was just more convenient for me to put in the fridge 24 hrs. before I needed it). I'd also suggest using only 1 maybe 1 1/2 loaves at the most of the multi-grain bread and at least 1 more 16 oz pkg. of seitan. For our taste it was simply too much stuffing and not enough seitan. Plan ahead and use your food processor - place the bread in the processor and lay out on a jelly roll pan overnight. Then place it in a storage bag until you're ready for it. I omitted the margarine and put the carrots celery onion and parsley together in the processor then dumped it in an XL (read: very large) bowl with the bread and omitted cooking the veggies entirely. Also for the egg replacer 5 1/2 tsp. is almost 2 Tbsp (1.8 Tbsp. to be exact). I purchased 2 dried vegan gravy mixes at my local natural foods store (I could not find garbanzo bean gravy mix); next time I'll make sure I'll have 4 envelopes agreeing with a previous reviewer that gravy is the key. Serve with a big bowl veggies and it's a wonderfully healthy and complete meal.",

I purchased shredded seitan by mistake but it worked out well and I will do it the same way next year. I used a 9 X 13 pan with a layer of chicken style shredded seitan chunks with garbanzo bean gravy a layer of stuffing another layer of seitan and gravy then topped it with the puff pastry. When it was done it was easy to cut and serve in pieces (much like a casserole). I think the texture of the shredded seitan is easier to deal with for meat eaters as it is a bit like the texture of actual Turkey. Fantastic recipe!",

It worked perfectly and allowed me to prepare everything the-day-of. And I bought an organic roll-out croissant dough as opposed to the puff pastry. This made it sooo good. This meal came out so tasty I was so proud of myself. And I whipped it all together the morning of thanksgiving with no troubles.",
