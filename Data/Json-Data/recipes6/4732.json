We are vegetarian and I wanted to duplicate the chicken pot pie of my youth (minus the chicken!)I added the tofu (but I browned it separately) and cooked the potatoes with the onions and garlic - I also added cauliflower and white cannelini beans - yum!  When you add extra veggies, just be sure to up liquid content (I used more milk and water - no broth) and salt enough. Taste \"sauce\" that forms to see if you like it - then adjust! I also added some paramasian cheese to the sauce - it was VERY very good! Hearty and fairly healthy!",

I added about 1/4 cup more potatoes reduced the broth by about 1/4 cup and there was actually a little room to spare. I did dice up the tofu and veggies fairly small which probably made a difference. Now that I know it fits I'll make the pieces a bit bigger next time. I also added more seasoning: thyme sage marjoram and a little bit of tamari. It was exquisite and I can't recommend it enough.

As others have commented, the potatoes need to be added with the onions.  Also, the recipe doesn't mention when to add the flour.  This should be added with the milk and broth in order to thicken.  I used a little less milk/broth/flour than the recipe called for because i was afraid it would be too milky.  I like how it turned out, but probably following the recipe measurements would work too.  I also added 1/4 cup each of sliced mushrooms and shredded cheese.  And as suggested by another reviewer, i poured a dash of soy sauce in when sauteing the tofu. Yum.",

My one issue is that when I was done the potato was still on the table... the recipe does not say when to add it so I didn't even notice the issue until after I sealed up the pie.
