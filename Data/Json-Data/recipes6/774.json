I doubled the sauce, and cooked the veges in half of it as another reviewer suggested.  I BBQ 'd the steak before slicing it up and tossed it in at the end.  I used gluten free spaghetti for a more authentic rice noodle taste without breaking the bank.  As far as vegetables go, snopeas, shredded carrots, sliced onion and button mushroom were used.  This recipe is a home run in my book.  I will be making it often.",

This has nice flavor, but the one criticism that I have is that it was a tad on the dry side.  The spaghetti really soaked up the sauce, so the next time I would increase that by at least half and, perhaps, even double it.   I used sliced bell peppers, sliced baby bok choy, julienned carrots, vertically-sliced red onion, and snow pea pods for the vegetable blend, and it worked out well.  This is a lot of pasta for 4 servings, and depending on what else you serve with it, it may be 6 servings.  We enjoyed and will make again.",

I used a bag of stir fry veggies from the store.  It was probably closer to 2 cups than 4.  I also used chicken tenders rather than steak.  So this is a very forgiving recipe.  It was really good!  The sauce is awesome.  I don't know what \"asian chile paste with garlic\" is so I used sirracha (about 1/2 Tbsp) and cut back on the oyster sauce (1/2 - 3/4 Tbsp) - since it was for the kids.  The sauce is really good.  Very flavorful.  It was a hit!  I'll definitely be making this again (and probably I'll end up making it on a regular basis).  Look forward to trying it with noodles - but I'd certainly double the sauce if I do.",

This was very close to restaurant style (bf said he thought it was better). The sauce gets nice and thick and coats the noodles perfectly. We used Japanese noodles instead of spaghetti. We chose pea pods carrots water chestnuts and green onion for the veggies. Everything worked so well together. Has a nice heat - I love sriracha but found I didn't even need to add any.
