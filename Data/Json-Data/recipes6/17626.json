I made it once as directed (except used Oreo crumbs for the crust, which I highly recommend) and it turned out perfectly - tasted amazing!  I made it a second time with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was really disappointing.  I'm usually all for low-fat modifications because often you can't really tell and it makes sweets a lot healthier, but resist the temptation here.  It just doesn't taste right and the texture is off.  Go all out on this if you're going to make it.  And do make it because you will seriously impress your friends and family.",

I made it for a church function last night and I had people coming up to me all night telling me how fabulous it was one girl scraped the bottom of the platter and showed me she had to o that just to get a taste. another man ate his and his wife's peice and tried to steal some one elses! I must have said thank you 100 times. I Used chocolate graham cracker for the crust milk chocolate intead of semi-sweet and baked it in a water bath. I was perfect. I cut it first into slices ( so it would be easier to serve) then I melted some more caramel and some chocolate and alternates swirling them over the cut peices which worked out nicely becuase it oozed down into the slices and made it taste even yummier and It looked prettier than if I had to cut it already decorated! thnak you so much for this reipe definetly making this again!!",

The caramel layer was not hard as some \"turtle\" type cheesecakes get I followed the recipe exactly making sure the ingredients were at room temperature. I baked in a 325 oven for exactly 50 mins. with a 9\" cake pan full of hot boiled water on the oven rack beneath the rack the cheesecake was on. The cheesecake had a 2-3\" wobbly circle in the centre at this point. I turned my oven off cracked the door open and left it for a good 4-5 hours until it was completely cool. It set up beautifully with NO cracks. I then transferred it to the fridge and decorated it the next day with sweetened whipped cream that I had added some whip cream stabilizer to. I also sprinkled the piped cream with some chopped pecans and added a cherry on top of each dollop of cream. To cut I ran hot water on the knife and wiped it off between each cut. It cut beautifully!! I served it with some Smucker's caramel sauce. Delish!! My sil absolutely loved it!! (i made it for her 40th b-day)",

If you do get tiny lumps they don't ruin the cheesecake; it's just not as pretty. Make sure your crust doesn't have any leaks for the caramel layer to go through or you'll have a hard time getting the pie out of the pan! I will probably pour the caramel over the top when serving instead next time. The caramel is chewy in the crust something some people may not like. Excellent recipe!",

Just make sure it's the thicker caramel. I toasted the pecan pieces before adding them to the caramel. I also used Ghirardelli milk chocolate (about a cup and a half of chips). I baked as instructed but with no water bath. 50 minutes in a 325 degree oven and then let it set in the oven for 2 hours. Do not open the oven door! It turned out perfectly no cracks!! So good so rich! I made this for my bosses birthday and everyone raved about it. The whole thing was gone in no time! Unfortunately I didn't grab a piece in time to take home to my husband as promised. Looks like I'll have to make another one!!!",
