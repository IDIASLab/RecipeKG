I also reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsps. I used a cookie scoop, flattened them slightly with a fork and baked for 10 minutes at 350. Everything else I usually keep the same, although I have also subbed the walnuts with pepitas or pecans and/or raisins. They always turn out great and everyone loves them.",
