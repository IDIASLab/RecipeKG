One thing to note, though, is that cottage cheese will not work for lasagna -- you need to get the 15-oz. container of WHOLE MILK ricotta. Also, a good idea is to bake it for the 30 minutes the night before, keep it in the refrigerator, and the next day, sprinkle the 1/2 pound of mozz on top and then bake for 15 minutes before serving. That way, the flavors gel overnight, but you still get the feeling of eating the lasagna \"fresh\".",

The only change I made was that I added fresh mushrooms and a bit more water to the sauce. STICK WITH THE COTTAGE CHEESE! I decided to try the cottage cheese instead of the ricotta like many others changed and I'm glad I stayed with cottage cheese. I did blend the cottage cheese up with a hand mixer however so it came out to the same consistancy as ricotta and so there wouldn't be any noticable curds in the lasagna. I've used ricotta on many other recipes and the cottage cheese beats it in flavor and creaminess by far!!! I will never use ricotta again. Thanks for such a great recipe! ",

I did use Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because of what I remember about eating cottage and peaches as a snack as a kid (ARGH).  Never want cottage cheese again.  Instead of no-bake noodle or boiling the noodles, I placed them in room temperature water for about 40 minutes and that worked great.  (got this from someone else on AllRecipes)\n\nI added about 1 teaspoon of basil and a bay leaf to the sauce while it simmered.  Be sure to remove the bay leaf!  \nSince it's only me and my 21 year old son at home, I have a lot of leftovers and it was exceptional the next day.  I also shared with my niece and her 2 year old and they loved it!!",

I added riccotta cheese instead of cottage like everyone else did...GOOD idea!  \nalso, added:  white wine, italian seasoning, fresh-chopped parsley, and mushrooms to the sauce.  It really adds flavor to it.  In addition, instead of cooking the sauce, I put it in the slow-cooker for an hour on high, then on low all day which really makes the sauce shine.  Just remember to add a bit of water and/or wine to it throughout the day.  Best stuff you'll ever taste!",

The sauce had a wonderful flavor and I would use it again for pasta (but the Slow Cooker Spinach Marinara from this site is my favorite).
