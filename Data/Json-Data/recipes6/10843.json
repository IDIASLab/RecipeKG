Butter need to be firm/cold to retain air. I always thought room temperature butter is the best to work with for baking.  Please work with cold butter!!! I guarantee the out come would be way better.\n\n***********\nThis is soooo my favorite.\nI've made this so many times. I like it a little less sweet, so I reduce white sugar to 3/4 cup. I've tried 1/2 cup and it came out a bit dry. And fat free sour cream makes it a bit dry too. So, stick with the regular sour cream. Also, I\u2019ve tried few different baking pans, but I found baking in a 10 inch tube pan makes it the moistest cake. Of course Bundt cake looks pretty, but I take the taste over the looks. Yum. Thank you for the recipe.",

It is easy to prepare, light to eat and looks very \"special\" when cooked in a fluted pan.  Even my two-year-old granddaughter really enjoyed it.  It stayed nice and moist and the glaze was just the right amount of topping for a breakfast entree.  You could easily add a few chopped nuts (pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts) to the cinnamon mixture, if desired.  I highly recommend this recipe both as a breakfast/brunch item or a dessert item.",

You can use any sour cream, even that tub in the back that's accidentally gotten frozen. My one tip is this: under no circumstances should you let the cinnamon filling touch the pan! Make a little rut all around the batter, carefully spoon in the cinnamon mixture, and carefully dollop the remaining batter on top. There should always be dough in between the cinnamon and the pan, or patches will stick to the pan when you turn the cake out. I LOVE this cake and I've made it 4 times now. Thank you!",
