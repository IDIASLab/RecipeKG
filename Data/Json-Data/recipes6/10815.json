I did use pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 t. of cinnamon to give it an extra bit of spice.  I baked it in a stoneware bar pan which was perfect for it.  Thank you for sharing!\n\nI've been making this cake for 3 years.  I always double the frosting and use about 3/4 of it on the cake.  I use 1 T. of the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice in place of just regular cinnamon.  It's also best when baked as a sheet cake, in a stoneware bar pan.  It bakes fine in 25 min. that way.  I've given out this recipe dozens of times!",

I thought this fairly standard recipe was good enough and certainly moist but this is not a recipe I d pull out again and make a point of making. Its biggest flaw is that a mere teaspoon of cinnamon is not enough spice to give this cake the flavor it needs. I don t have an issue with cinnamon being the only spice used; it just needs a lot more of it like maybe a full tablespoon! And I d actually prefer the complexity of flavor that any combination of cinnamon nutmeg cloves ginger or allspice would contribute. Just as is the taste falls flat. Complicating matters is the wimpy amount of frosting which I didn t use. A more traditional amount of frosting 1/2 c. butter 1 (8 oz.) package of cream cheese 3-1/2 4 cups of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla is much more suitable. But Hubs disagreed. He liked it just fine. Three stars (barely) from me four from him. I baked this as a 9 layer cake about 33 minutes.",
