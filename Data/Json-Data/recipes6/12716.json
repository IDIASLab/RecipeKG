I used butter instead of shortening one cup of sugar instead of 3/4 and a whole egg and no milk in the batter. Also I used 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder instead of the chocolate square and milk when making the chocolate dough. The end result was amazing! Although time consuming because of chilling the dough these were a lot of fun to make and I was very proud of what I ended up with. Friends and family all found them delicious--nice and sweet with a bit of chocolate =)",

I also substituted butter for shortening and used 3/4 c. sugar instead of the 1/2 c. listed. For the 2nd batch (chocolate) I used 4 Tablespoons of powdered (unsweetened) cocoa instead of the chocolate square. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes -at a higher temp they'll be a bit too crispy. Letting the dough refrigerate long enough is important otherwise the chocolate will bleed into the vanilla. Making the recipe this way I yielded 4 dozen cookies (enough cookies to make this recipe worth while - as it takes time to refrigerate the dought twice)! I gave this recipe 4 starts because this is a good \"solid cookie\" - it has it's own very cool look and it's tasty. The downfall of the recipe is the prep time to refrigertate the dough.",

As written, they aren't sweet enough, we increase the sugar to 3/4c; also use butter instead of shortening.  The result is exactly what he wanted.  Yes, time consuming and a bit of work, but worth it.  Make sure you chill the dough properly or it will be too soft to work with: I chill dough balls for 1.5 hrs, roll them out using wax paper on top and bottom, then place choc layer on top of white, make the jelly-roll, and then chill the roll wrapped in wax paper for 3 hrs.  Unwrap and the cold dough slices perfectly with a sharp knife.  Double or triple the recipe and freeze the extra cookies so you don't have to go through the work every time you want these, thats what we do.  Works great.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used a ton of powdered sugar to roll it out it still stuck everywhere and thank Goodness I used sugar and not flour to roll it! The chocolate dough was bitter and the vanilla dough was bland. The ONLY reason I'm giving this three stars is because my 1 year old can't get enough of these cookies. Everybody over 1 thinks they stink. I ended up globbing together the two doughs and rolling 'em into tie-dye balls which my 6 year old thought looked awesome till he tasted them.",
