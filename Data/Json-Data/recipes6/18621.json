Great as an appetizer just place one med-large spinach ravioli in the center of bowl and top with soup for a wonderful color contrast or serve with a salad and some crusty bread for a filling dinner. Great winter dish to warm your bones! Also the recipe should state 2 medium butternut squashes peeled seeded and diced with just enough chicken stock to cover. This should help with the thickness. Since I have had a hard time finding the spinach pasta cheese ravioli I have also tried the tri colored tortellini the texture is very good. For vegetarians who would like to make this soup you can substitute a light vegetable stock for the chicken stock called for in the original recipe.",

I would suggest adding MORE SQUASH though - I doubled the amount of squash because when I pureed it the first time I found it too thin. Doubling the amount of squash just makes the flavor deeper but doesn't affect the other ingredient proportions. For those looking to lighten it even further I replaced the light cream with rice milk (you could do soy milk also).",

I made the soup first and then added chopped up raw shrimp which cooked in the steaming hot soup while the ravioli's boiled. Turned out delicious. Without the alterations i expect this soup is just as good. The potato just thickened it up and gave it more substance and the shrimp was a delicious pairing. So was a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon!:)",

My VERY VERY picky kids loved it and my very skeptical husband quietly slurped down bowl after bowl. We literally fought over the leftovers! I accidentally only had heavy whipping cream on hand instead of light cream and I'd have to admit that little \"accident\" was quite decadent! I'm sure it would be lovely with the light cream too. I have another squash roasting in the oven right now to do it all over again! (I roasted the squash first then cubed it because I just don't like cutting uncooked squash.)",

Everything was going along great...The soup smelled fabulous, the flavor was fantastic...then I added the cream.  Big mistake.  The cream had the effect of thickening the soup and mellowing the flavors too much.  Used spinach/cheese tortellini and it went well, under the circumstances.  The flavors definitely say \"fall\" so I'll try this soup again but only as a first course and omit the cream entirely.",
