I did think I had made a mistake before I stirred in the mango though. The batter before the mango was very thick. I was thinking about what liquid I could add; however once the mangos were mixed in the consistency was fine. I will definitly make this bread again even though my 17 month-old didn't really eat it. Everyone else loved it.",
