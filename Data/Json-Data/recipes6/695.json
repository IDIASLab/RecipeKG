I used a 4-cup measure for the butter brown sugar and corn syrup mixture and was glad I did as the mixture rises while cooking. This was cooked in an 1100-watt microwave for a total of five minutes stopping once at 3 minutes to stir. This was then poured over the Chex/pretzel/nut mixture and stirred to coat. The mixture did not coat well. If I make this again I'll cook it for less time yet-possibly 4 or 4.5 minutes-to allow the mixtue to be thin enough to coat well. I would also reduce the pretzels to one cup as I felt the pretzel taste dominated the mixture. This is a quick snack if you have the ingredients and need something fast. It is a typical sweet/salty mixture good but not great.",

I used a combo of corn and rice Chex as that is what I had on hand and mini pretzel twists that I broke up a bit. I halved the recipe just to try and it made a good amount. The kids are really enjoying it! I would make this again but would maybe double the caramel mixture for a better coating. Thanks for sharing.:)",
