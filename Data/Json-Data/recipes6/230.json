I didn't have any brown sugar so I left it out and I also didn't have green onion so I used regular white onion and added just a pinch of paprika instead which added a little kick to it! With out the sugar the lemon stands out but I served it over plain white rice to balance out the intense flavors. Overall delicious!",

We only got this by mistake when the guy at the store confused our package of red snapper with the order of customer next to us who was getting catfish fillets! So I came to Allrecipes and luckily found this recipe. I made this recipe with a few minor changes: Didn't have green onion or fresh garlic so I used a bit of yellow onion and garlic powder instead. Also I cut the amount of sugar down to a scant two tablespoons. Coupled with the onion (and a couple dashes of onion powder for luck ) this makes a sauce that complements the catfish fillets really well. The sweetness of the onion and sugar is a delightful counter to the pong of a fish that lives in turbid waters. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a break from the standard catfish in cornmeal.",
