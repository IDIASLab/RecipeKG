We're a Chinese family living in San Francisco who go out to Chinatown every weekend so we know our Chinese dim sum! After starting the crust I realized I didn't have any evaporated milk so I substituted instant skim milk powder reconstituted in water (we don't keep milk around the house). It still turned out great! The custard is perfect - just like the ones from Chinatown! Next time I'll reduce the sugar in the crust because it reminded me of a sugar cookie. I also used a mini muffin tin because I didnt' have any tart shells. I would recommend rolling the dough into balls and rolling them out with a rolling pin because the crust was uneven and a little too thick in some of them. I would also lower the oven temperature next time because the crust was brown before the custard was set though it may be because I used the mini muffin tin. The house smelled wonderful while these were baking!",

I hesitated after seeing the mix reviews but decided to go ahead anyway.The recipe is easy to follow, and yes, the tarts taste like bought-from-store. I've reduced the sugar for the dough to 90gm and 100 gm for the custard as I do not like them too sweet. And yes, there is too much custard for the dough - you'll need 1.5 times of the dough to use up the custard. I've substituted evaporated milk with fresh milk and they still turn out great. I've tried replacing butter with margarine and regretted it - the tarts were bland. So just stick to butter. Will definitely make this again. My dad and husband were totally impressed! Thanks for the recipe :}",

The tart shells came out perfect and golden but the custard was overcooked on the top- there was a thick gel-like layer instead of wobbly custard goodness. I baked my second batch at 190 degrees celsius for 17 minutes; they turned out fantastically!",

Maybe it's because the ingredients are different here. I had to use Self Raising Flour which didn't turn out the way it should like the picture. I also have plenty of eggs left from the 9 eggs that were beaten. I thought it would be easy but it wasn't as easy as I thought. Could you tell me if its ok to use SELF RAISING FLOUR and should I purchase foil styled baking cases? As I found the paper baking cases weren't as good as the egg pours out of the tart. The tart also raise to high that it burns so fast at the top but that's because I've been using SELF RAISING FLOUR because I couldn't find ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. Anyway I hope you can help as I love Chinese Egg Tarts and want to learn how to make it so I can share with my friends and family. It cost 80p each for a Chinese Egg Tart here in Scotland and that's very expensive.",

The Hong Kong egg tarts I've had in SF and in Hong Kong always had a puff pastry kind of crust so next time I'll use puff pastry. I used a muffin (12) mini muffin (24) and 2 four-inch tart pans and still had enough dough to make more. There was also a lot of the filling left maybe about 2 cups. I had to use almost an extra stick of butter for the dough to hold together and instead of using a fork I used a pastry blender. It d probably be easier to use a food processor. My first batch the crust browned too much before the custard was set so I lowered the temp and baked until the middle jiggled then took it out of the oven. The middle of the tart should be more like a flan. I thought it tasted a bit eggy I might just use less eggs next time.",
