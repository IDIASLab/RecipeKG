The dressing was a little sweet for my taste but that may have been my vinegar which was white wine vinegar. I added a little extra vinegar and some salt and pepper. I loved the crispy bacon with the sweetness of the dressing. I might add some matchstick carrots next time for some added crunch and color. Thanks for a very tasty recipe!",
