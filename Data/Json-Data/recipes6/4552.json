I altered some of the ingredients as I didn't have everything required, but it was still ended up tasting great:\n* didn't have the soup, so used milk;\n* added a dash of chilli powder; &\n* used broccoli instead of kale.\nI also more than doubled the pasta required (must have bigger appetites than the author!).\n\nMarch 23, 2008 - I have made this recipe several more times with all the ingredients to hand, except I cannot source Kale. Continued using broccoli instead - tastes fantastic. Thanks.",

I followed the recipe closely and I found that the cooking times for the veggies were too long.  I used Campbells Gardennay's Leek and potato soup and some homemade veggie stock.  It turned out beautifully.  For the next time I might broil the dish for a few minutes to brown the cheese a bit. It might be good with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar or some parm.\n\nYummy, yummy, yummy! ",

It turned out creamy and had lots of flavor. Thanks for the recipe! It sure beats Tuna Helper :)",

I made a few minor changes for what I had on hand (& to make it Gluten Free To make GF I first sprayed glass 9 x 13 dish w/olive oil then put 12 oz Schaar GF penne pasta in the bottom UNCOOKED (GF pasta won t stand much cooking). I saut\u00e9ed onion celery red bell pepper garlic together (still tender crisp) added salt pepper 1/4 C red wine (it's what I had open) 8 oz frozen chopped spinach 1 sprig of fresh basil & 3 or 4 stems cilantro chopped and simmered on medium heat covered until the spinach was thawed abt 2 or 3 min. Next stirred in about 1/2 of a small steamed cauliflower left from the night before along with the salmon. Spread the mixture evenly over the top of the uncooked pasta (in the casserole dish) poured 16 oz Imagine brand Potato Leek soup on the top next 1 C chicken stock (extra b/c pasta wasn't cooked before hand) sprinkled top with a generous cup of Daia (nondairy) Cheddar Cheese followed by 1/3 Gluten Free bread crumbs. I misread directions - preheated and baked at 350 instead of 375 needed 30 minutes instead of 25 for the pasta to be cooked al dente but then I put it in uncooked too. All in all my kind of recipe healthy easy one dish and liked by all! I gave only 4 stars b/c I think it needs more than 8 oz pasta & 1 can of fish per 8 people.",
