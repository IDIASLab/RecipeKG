The cleaniest way to make this is place a cake rake in a roasted pan lined with foil because the basting sauce with drip off the pork and either get burned into your pan taking forever to soak and scrub off, or drip into your oven requiring you to clean if.  This is an excellent recipe and quite as good as what you get in Chinese restaurants.  However, it is time consuming so if you go through the effort of making a batch and you know you like it, make a double or triple batch because it does not take anymore time than a single and extras freeze well.",

I kept some sauce on reserve and poured over the meat after 30 minutes of baking and turning the pieces over.  Fifteen minutes later, I took it out and drained the excess sauce into a pan to reduce and then pour over the meat.  I served this with broccoli slaw sauteed with sesame oil.  Delicious!
