I assume a 6-cup muffin tin has larger cups (like jumbo muffins) than my 12-cup pan.  I ended up putting the mashed potatoes on the side (with gravy). My young grandbaby doesn't like her food to \"touch\" anything else on her plate so I thought the potatoes on the side would be best for her. Unfortunately, she had seen me add the onions and green pepper to the mixture while she was doing her homework so she pretty much nixed them before they were even on the table. Although these did not please the picky child, the rest of us enjoyed them very much! I received repeated compliments on these meatloaf cupcakes. I will definitely make them again. I will probably double the recipe and freeze the leftovers for a future meal. Thanks for the recipe, matykada!",
