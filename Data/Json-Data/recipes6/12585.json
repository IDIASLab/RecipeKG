In a pinch, I used Toll House White Chocolate chips (yes, the one from the store) and honestly folks, it turned out just as good.  I did follow the advice of one post and microwaved the chips and butter in a glass bowl at 40% power - around 4 1/2 min.  I whisked it half way through.  I've also used quality white chocolate chunks and I really couldn't tell a difference, other than the fact that it was easier to melt due to a higher fat content. Either way, it was the same taste and goodness.  25 min. bake time was also right on.  I used a ceramic baking dish, (i.e., 2 1/2 quart square casserole dish), so the edges and bottom didn't burn.  Don't use a dark pan for this, or else these will get too brown.  I suggest porcelain or glass dish.",

(Not to mention the cup of chocolate chips!) And those who tried to compensate by overbaking these to a \"biscuit\" are not accounting for this unavoidability. I guess I'd call it more \"fudgey\" rather than brownie-like. It's not the fault of the recipe I guess--but it really didn't appeal to me. Again, expecting these to be chewy, like a tradional blonde brownie, is almost the same as expecting fudge to be chewy. These were okay, but not worth a repeat. Who wants something to be just okay when you're using 8 ozs. of quality chocolate?  (Not to mention the chocolate chips...) Update: Hubby REALLY liked these, and he said his staff did as well. Guess I need to upgrade these from three to four stars!",

(This makes the texture and flavor perfect) I get real white chocolate from my chocolate store. Also it's better if they are completely cooled even chilled before you try to cut them. I make them the night before let them set really good and cut them the next day. They are perfect the next day. Cut them small! They are very rich but awesome.
