I only varied from the recipe in two minor details; one I cooked on high for half the time and two I didn't rinse the sauerkraut but I did drain. I am the kind of guy that likes sauerkraut and kielbasa or sausage in the slow cooker all alone. Juice and all from the sauerkraut. So when I saw this with the sweetness added and the juice drained I didn't know where it would take me. I was really thinking about even eliminating the caraway but I'm glad I put my faith in the recipe. I liked this perfect as written. Will I always make it this way? Probably not but I will definitely make it again just as written. As much of a fan of the sourness of sauerkraut that I am I didn't find this too sweet at all. The onions kind of got absorbed in and I didn't notice them but I'm sure they added to the experience. The carrots were a nice diversion. 5 stars MellieLynn. Thank you!",

Used beer instead of water and saut\u00e9ed everything before putting it all together in crock pot. Also added some ground mustard to fit our taste. We all loved it! Think saut\u00e9ing before helps meld the flavors even more. THanks for the recipe. It's now in my favorites slot!!",
