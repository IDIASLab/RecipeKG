Also, let the bagels rise for at least 1-2hrs after forming, this will enable them to take shape and not look so narly. I think 9 bagels for this amt. of dough is too much. Make 6, so they are big. The flavor was good, and its a fun thing to do with your kids, but I will stick to the bakery. Thanks for the recipe though, it was fun:)",

We love Panera Asiago Cheese bagels, so I added 1/2 cup shredded asiago cheese to the dough, shaped them, let them rise for 30 minutes (great tip!), boiled them, then topped each with a little more shredded asiago cheese.  My husband said if he didn't know I made them, he would have thought they came from the bagel shop!  Since the original recipe made 9 large bagels, which are pretty big, I made them again, and divided it to make 12.  They were a little smaller, but a better portion for us.  I'll be making this recipe again and again!",

I usually get 9 large bagels. I used 2 tbs of molasses in the water instead of sugar. I also used olive oil glaze because the egg had a funny after taste",

I made whole wheat cinnamon raisin bagels as follows:\nI used 2T of Splenda instead of the sugar in the beginning.  I then tried to make them healthier by using 1 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c of wheat germ.  I mixed it all in my Kitchenaid.  Once it had all pulled together I added 1c of white bread flour about 1/4 c at a time until the whole cup was mixed in.  I then added 2t of cinnamon and 3/4c of raisins.  I let that all rise in a warm oven (covered) 30 minutes.  I shaped them into balls, stuck a finger in the middle and placed them back in the warm oven (covered) for another 1/2 hour.  I then boiled them in water with 3T blackstrap molasses as someone else recommended.  I think you could probably get away with only 1T.  I'll try that next time.  I boiled them closer to 2 minutes each.  I realized too late I didn't have any cornmeal so I just sprayed the pan real well and it was fine.  I also forgot all about the egg wash which was fine too.  Watch your baking time as mine didn't need 20 to 25 minutes.",

Like most other people recommended I have increased the water to 1 1/8 cups and halved the quantities of both sugar and salt.  I found that watching the bagel rolling video on YouTube was a great help, but I now cheat and use a medium cookie dough cutter to cut the bagel and then a very small round cutter to cut out the whole in the middle, to almost perfect results.  I do find that the whole process takes a little too long to make from start to finish for breakfast, so I started freezing the dough.  I make the dough as usual and cut in to shape, but before allowing the dough to rise.  I place the bagels on a baking tray and freeze.  Once the bagels have frozen I transfer them to a plastic container, using wax paper in between the layers. (I can usually get 3 layers in my containers). Then I can take out the desired number of bagels and thaw them in the microwave for 50 seconds on full power.  I then let them rise in a warm place for 20 minutes.  (I always heat the oven to 200 degrees for 2 minutes, before turning the oven off and placing the dough inside to rise).  Then continue with the rest of the recipe, I boil each bagel for 1 minute on each side, glaze with the egg white and then cover with Asiago cheese and bake for 20-25 minutes, perfect!!!",
