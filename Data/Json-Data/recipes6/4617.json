I made the risotto up to the point of adding the cheese and felt it was the right consistency and the flavor of beets was really coming through. It definitely needed salt to bring out the flavor. I was hesitant to overwhelm the dish with the cheese so only used half. It tasted good but ended up very cheddary tasting. I'd recommend if you like the beet flavor to add 1/4-1/2 the cheese in the original recipe and add some acid in the form of lemon juice or some green onion at the end. Otherwise a great idea for risotto. Really like using the whole beet greens and all.",
