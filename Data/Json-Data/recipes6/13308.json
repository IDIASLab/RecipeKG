It came out very firm, almost like lemon meringue pie. So next time, the only thing I will change is the sugar. I will use 1/2 cup sugar like I did this time, but do everything else the way it called for in the recipe. We would have preferred at least a bit of juiciness. Also, I cooked it for about 5 minutes longer because I wanted the top to be entirely golden brown and it was not quite like that at 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis would be great with any summer fruit or berries - I am going to try it with peaches when the season comes round.\r\n",

Usually i do berries or fruit topped with cake batter...but this pudding cake kinda way with pouring over the water mixture just sets everything together...VERY good. I used fresh sweet cherries...and cut back the sugar to half of what was called for and it was sweet enough with the dark cherries. A hit for sure...and i will be experimenting with different berries and fruit fillings. Thanks a bunch.",

It seems, as it is with pies, that in addition to individual tastes and preferences, how sweet or juicy the fruit is also makes a difference.  I decided to play it safe and reduce the sugar and water in the cornstarch mixture just a teensy bit \u2013 to 3/4 cup water and slightly more than 1/2 cup sugar - not huge changes, but it made me feel better.  :)  As it turns out, this is pretty much a perfect recipe.  Perfect baking time \u2013 45 minutes was right on.  Perfect amounts of everything - in fact, my reducing the amounts of sugar and water, even a little bit, was probably unnecessary.   Perfectly delicious and it looks perfect too.  My first fresh cherry cobbler.  And it was perfect.  (As a side note, my fingers show the fruits of my labor.  They\u2019re stained deep purple.  So to the uninitiated in cherry pitting as I was, it might be wise, particularly if you\u2019re attending an event the next evening as I am, to wear some gloves)",

The biscuit topping was good but 1 c of sugar was WAY too much and the syrup didn't thicken up at all - it was like cherry flavored sugar water.
