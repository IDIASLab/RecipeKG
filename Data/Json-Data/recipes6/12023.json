Just the thing if you are looking for a fudgy brownie as opposed to a cake-y one. A word of caution: they will stick to the pan!  The original recipe calls for covering the pan with foil, leaving enough at edges to form handles.  Grease the foil generously.  It works well.",

As another reviewer mentioned the instructions do say to foil & grease the 9 X 13 pan, which I did & used pam with flour, and I had no problems with sticking.\n\nI followed the  variation on the box for a more cakey brownie which was to add 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/2 cup of milk. Perfect. Will definitely make these again :)\n\nEdit: I made these again and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, while upping the vanilla to 2 tsp and they were much better.",

(Or the other, identical, \"One Bowl Brownie\" recipe from this site...) I know there are differences from one person to the next on what makes brownies \"the best,\" but in my judgment no one could possibly disagree this is it unless they somehow goofed up the recipe.  Easy to mix up, rich, buttery, fudgy, chewy on the edges and just the right amount of \"chocolatiness\" and sweetness (some brownies are so sweet they make my teeth hurt!). As long you don't overmix or overbake these, you'll have the perfect brownie - like the kind that beckon you from bakery shelves with their beauty only these taste a whole lot better!  So make these - and top them off with \"Fudge Frosting,\" also from this site.  (I made half the recipe, baked in a foil lined pan, 22 minutes)",

Several people suggested following the instructions exactly the first time I tried substituting cocoa powder and butter for unsweetened chocolate squares (they don't have those in Russia) I also wasn t paying attention and put the eggs in before the sugar maybe the problem was the butter was too hot and semi-cooked the eggs? I don t know but the batter was chunky and not nice at all. I cooked them and they tasted good but the texture was gummy and I needed a chisel to get them out of the pan. The second time I followed the recipe precisely and they were perfect. My whole house smelled chocolatey and when I taste tested one I ended up tasting (uh) three. Nice and crusty on top soft but cooked in the middle my second batch didn t stick to the pan at all I was going to try out several recipes but I will go no further. This is my brownie recipe I m sure my Russian friends will love them! (Guess I ll be packing unsweetened chocolate squares in my suitcase!)",

I used old old old Hershey's baking chocolate the first time--only half of what was ordered (because I am an idiot and cannot always read very well). I realized the problem and made an icing (cocoa-based) and they got raves by everyone at the school party. The next time I made them with Girardelli (sp?) baking chocolate and they turned out amazing again--very rich and chocolatey. The next time I used the same chocolate and added a little Kahlua-maybe 3 Tbsp and put a glaze on again. Once again, everyone loved them. These are so so easy and the one-bowl to wash up? How can you beat that?",

I like dense brownies but these were more like thick brownie crackers; they were chewy and crunchy on the edges and just plain chewy through the middle. Thanks for the recipe but I'll keep looking.",
