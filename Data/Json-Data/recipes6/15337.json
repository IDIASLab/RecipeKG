Followed suggestions (sort by \"most helpful\") and baked at 375 F for 8-9 minutes, used 2 tsp. vanilla, decreased sugar to 3/4 c. EACH, used 1.5 sticks of Nucoa margarine (same thing as 3/4 c.) Shaped fairly large, oversized, round balls of dough, and used Ghiradelli and Tropical Souce brand chocolate chips. In place of the two eggs, I used a total of 1/4 c. water. (1 egg = 2 Tbs. water) If mixture is still a bit dry, add just enough water for it to come together. This way, even those with dairy/egg allergies can have some! Baked on parchment paper, and also added small dashes of ginger and cinnamon to half the batch. Have already made two batches since discovering them a month ago. My mum makes the exact same recipe--but with eggs, and people don't know the difference. :o)",
