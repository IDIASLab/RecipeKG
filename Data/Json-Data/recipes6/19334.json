I had none of the issues or criticisms others experienced like graininess, flecks of chocolate, consistency, freezing time, etc. In my opinion this is a flawless recipe, and my suggestion is to use the finest chocolate your budget can afford. I used 3 ozs. of Scharffenberger chocolate (by accident!) and it was perfect, tho' die hard chocoholics might even appreciate another ounce. This had a smooth, velvety mouth feel, totally creamy, chocolatey and rich. This is every bit as good as the frozen custard Wisconsin is so famous for. The directions are well written and easy to follow. No need to change or add a thing--unless you have some unexplainable burning desire to do so!",

                "reviewBody": "I agree with some others who had trouble getting this to freeze, except... I persisted and now I rate this a 5 star. On my first batch, I hurried.  I didn't \"temper\" the eggs properly (that's where you take warm mix out, add to egg & return to the pan).  And I threw in semi sweet chips that I presumed had melted sufficiently.  Then I failed to chill well before putting in my machine.  Worse yet, I used my Cuisinart freezer that allows a fairly thick build-up in the canister between the dasher & the edge, preventing the center from getting to the coldest area.  The band-aid was to put the half-frozen mix into a shallow container in the freezer and stir every few hours until it was ice cream.  Tasted good, but had \"bits\" (either choc chip or egg - not sure)  The CURE is: follow the directions!  Do not boil, properly temper the eggs, use as tiny chocolate bits as you can (shaved is best), chill completely before freezing, and use a maker whose dasher really scrapes the canister edge. (My Waring did great)  If you don't hurry, you will be rewarded with a very rich, delicious ice cream.  As another reviewer stated - not overly chocolate in flavor, but exceptionally rich in taste & texture.",
