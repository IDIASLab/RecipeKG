First the recipe said 3 dozen. I followed the ingredients and came up to 30 tarts. I should have cooled the dough first. With other tarts I made I usually cool it to make it easier to shape with the pan. You can do it right away but I suggest cooling it. When removing the tarts from the pan it was very difficult. The crust was very flakey. It was delicious but flakey. A few came out easily. I will definitely try this tart again for an upcoming luau party. Just a few things differently then I think it would come out better.",

Ran a thin paring knife around edges and they came out easy. I would recommend: Making 1\" balls of dough then chilling before molding into cups (I had to keep flouring my finger to keep dough from sticking to it). Also don't press dough above the top of the cups. Taste is very good!!",
