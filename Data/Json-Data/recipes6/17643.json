It was still not too sweet but tasted more like a dark chocolate. It looked very pretty sliced on a dessert plate that had been drizzled with chocolate syrup! My family liked this dessert and we will be making it again. Remember to close container tightly in fridge for storage so the cake will not dry out.",
