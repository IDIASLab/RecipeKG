Also added carrots since I needed to get rid of them. Amounts were all used as measured (for 2 servings) though. All in all this tasted good - I think the sweetness of the carrots mixed with the honey might have added something and I also let the meat and veggies sear slightly in the pan to add a slightly smoky flavor. I ate it over ramen noodles with a dash of vinegar and that tasted good - I suspect it might be equally good over rice as others suggested.",
