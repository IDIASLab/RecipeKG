I was nervous about this bread as I had read the reviews prior to baking it so I added a few things to moisten the bread and make it more appealing to a bigger crowd. - 1/2 cup or so of sour cream - 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon - 1 tbsp maple syrup - 1 tsp ground cloves I used different amounts of white and brown sugar - it came out peanut buttery and sweet and I got some good compliments from several folks! I added chocolate chips the next time and more people were willing to try it and plenty more liked it. Altogether not a bad recipe at all!! Thanks!",
