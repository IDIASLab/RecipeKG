You should never soak or wash the rice in cold water as directed because cold water will disrupt the cooking process when the rice finally enters the boiling water. You should soak the rice in luke warm to room temp water. And further more you should NOT boil the rice for 15 minutes this is called \"over-cooking\" this is why your rice will come out mushy. You should only boil the water for 5minutes. It depends how long you soaked it the longer you soak it the shorter time it needs to be boiled. If you soak it for 30minutes you should boil until 10min max. But if soak for more than 30min then please only boil for 5 minutes and then transfer to oven. The recipe given above is wrong and not in conformity with how good Qabuli or even good rice is made that is why too many people are coming up with \"mushy\" rice.",
