Tonight however he raved and gave this dish a full five stars! Due to allergies I omitted the lemon grass and subbed with a little rind and juice of a lemon. Due to hatred of cilantro we eliminated that and used parsley. I added garlic and onion powders to the breading and sprayed the chicken with olive oil. I marinated the chicken overnight which resulted in an amazingly moist breast. Family thanks you Shabern!",
