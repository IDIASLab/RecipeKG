Can't stand cilantro? Use fresh parsley, instead. Make these the way you like them. Serve with additional coconut aminos or soy sauce, if desired.",

The only changes I made were that I tossed in some diced red bell pepper instead of mushrooms (my husband hates mushrooms) and used lettuce instead of cabbage for the wraps as that\u2019s what I had on hand. Served with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping or to lightly spoon on top of the filled wraps. This was a hit in our house and will be making it again (with some mushrooms on the side for me to add into my wraps ;) )! Thank you for a great recipe, Bibi!",
