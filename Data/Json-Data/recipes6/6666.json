As it turns out everyone in my family loves it; even my picky sister who hates bananas! This is a recipe for when the kids say, 'Mom can we go to Sonic&reg;? We want a milkshake!' And instead the kids can eat a delicious, healthy, and filling summer snack. The most important direction of all: Enjoy!",
