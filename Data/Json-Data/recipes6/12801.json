Added crushed chocolate covered espresso beans. My husband ate the whole batch in two days. Thanks Nan!",

We did make an alteration though I used brown sugar (half brown half white). We also coated the cookies in dark chocolate and sprinkled some coconut on top - my son loved doing that! I'll be making another batch when son's in kindergarten and husband at work so that I can hide the cookies and save them for Christmas:)",
