Don't be surprised when it looks horrible as it starts cooking cause it's not too pretty. However I followed the directions to a T and they came out wonderful!!Everyone loved them and a few people left with the recipe! I will be making bags/tins of these for gifts next Christmas!

This has a nice light and crunchy texture and taste and what I love about this recipe is that you can take your time to evenly coat the nuts (and you can noticeably see which ones you've coated) while a lot of other candied nut recipes involving using the stovetop you are required to work very quickly to coat the nuts before the mixture hardens. I compared these candied nuts with the stovetop candied nuts and the feedback was that these ones tasted more unique! I also personally prefer the texture look and taste of these ones. I will definitely be making these again",

A little strange looking when you first start mixing the nuts with the egg whites and put them on the 'swimming in butter' tray. But it all makes sense as you begin to toss them every half hour. I quadrupled the recipe and turned pecans walnuts and almonds into Swedish Nuts. They were incredible additions to my gift baskets. They are a new tradition I'm adding to my recipe box for family and friends! Oh and as much as you'll be tempted to for the sake of calories...don't skimp on the butter. The butter helps to brown and crisp the nuts. The batch I skimped on its easy to tell the difference. They didn't brown as much and looked more beige than brown. You don't want that.",
