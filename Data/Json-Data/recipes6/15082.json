Besides the fact that in under 10 minutes it charred to become something you might expect to find at the bottom of a fire pit it was not only too bubbly to support it's weight but also overflowed all over the (fortunately removable) rotating microwave plate. I can't say if this cake was tasty or not as I didn't dare put any in my mouth. However it doesn't smell wonderful while cooking (even before burning). I know I'm crazy but I think I'm willing to try this again.",
