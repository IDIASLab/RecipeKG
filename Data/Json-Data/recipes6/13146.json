I made a few changes just for personal preference, I reduced the dates to 1 1/4 cups, added 1/4 cup of golden raisins, and increased the walnuts to one full cup.  I also used 2/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of white sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Also increased the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp and left off the powdered sugar as others suggested.  Although I'm sure this would be awesome as it's originally written.  I will be adding this to my recipe books.",
