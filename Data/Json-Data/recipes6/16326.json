I used 1 1/2 cups instead of two, and I added a tablespoon of white vinegar because it's called for in my other recipes. My baking time was 55 minutes. I think I could've gotten away with 50, but the other suggestions mentioned much longer cooking times. It just takes a little while to set. I covered the crust edge and removed it at 45 minutes. Next time, I'll gently lay a loose piece of foil over the whole pie to prevent over-browning. Whisk it well, and strain if you're afraid of getting those tiny little egg pieces. Great flavor and texture!",
