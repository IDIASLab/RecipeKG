Because I didn't I had to make this into a meatloaf. But it was still delightful! The hot sauce adds a nice kick. I did reduce the pepper to 1 tsp and the seasoned salt to 1 tsp as well. And I didn't use onions. Instead I added onion powder and just put the garlic (3 cloves) right in with everything else. The quinoa really is a nice touch and I will definitely make this again.",

I cooked them the full 45 minutes and they were browned on top and easy to remove for on buns.",
