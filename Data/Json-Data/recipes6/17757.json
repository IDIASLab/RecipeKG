No need to add extra oatmeal at all, or to cook longer than one minute if you get the syrup to a rapid boil before you start timing. They are peanut butter no bakes, there's no chocolate added because they are PEANUT BUTTER no bakes. ",

They are very sweet,  very peanut buttery, and have a perfect texture; slightly hard on the outside into a nice chewy middle.  It is crucial that you boil the sugar solution for a full minute or else you will end up with gloopy cookies that never really harden.  If you boil the solution too long, the cookies will turn out dry and fall apart.  I generally cook mine for just over a minute.  I know some people who throw in extra oats because they think the batter looks too runny; this is not necessary and will make your cookies tough and bland.  The batter will look a bit runny, but it's fine; the cookies will set up nicely despite this.  The hard part is waiting for the cookies to set!  ",
