I used butter instead of margarine and being a lazy cook, I dumped all the ingredients into my mixer bowl and used the dough hooks for 8 minutes. Let it rise and made hamburger buns out of it. Let the formed buns rise for another 30 minutes, popped them in the oven for 12 minutes or so and YUM!! They rose nice and tall with a soft texture and were delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it'll be one of my keepers.",

I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes until it looked creamy then added the \"soured\" milk (I didn't want to take the chance that vinegar soured milk might kill my yeast--I used lemon juice to make sour milk this time.) the melted butter salt and AP flour. (I omitted the baking soda purely by accident I just happened to overlook it when I was making the bread.) This recipe needed no extra flour to get it into a ball. I kneaded it with my dough hook for about five minutes. I let this rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad until it doubled then formed the dough into balls and plopped them into greased muffin tins. I then covered it with saran wrap and let them rise in the pan on the warm heating pad. I got nine biggish rolls out of a halved recipe. Very good bread/roll recipe--soft and really airy. It's going to sound weird but it reminds me of italian bread only without the hard crust on the outside if that makes sense. NOTE: I noticed the difference from using soured milk instead of buttermilk I will use the real deal next time.",

I warmed the butter and buttermilk together and added it to the yeast that was proofing in the warm water. Instead of white sugar, I used a 1/2 cup of pure honey. I let it sit a few minutes more while I mixed the dry ingredients together. I used about 1 1/2 tsp of salt since there was already salted butter. Once I mixed everything together by hand, it took the bread an hour to rise up. I halved the dough into 2 loaves. I placed them each into two greased (buttered) loaf pans. It rose again about half hour later. I then brushed the top of the bread with, \"Honey Butter,\" from this website. The smell of the bread baking was so heavenly! They both baked right up in the pans with a nice golden brown color on top. The top of the bread is crusty and has a nice sweet crispness to it. I thought the buttermilk might leave that bit of \"sour tang\" in the bread but it did not. Instead I could smell and taste the buttermilk as well as the honey...Mmmm. The bread is just so moist and sweet especially when eaten warm. The inside texture is so soft I could eat it plain with no butter. My family requested that I make a honey butter to spread all over their bread. It was worth making this bread. This exceeded my expectations and we all loved it! I served this with, \"Hearty Chicken Vegetable Soup I,\" from this site.",

I've found that doughs (such as this recipe) with higher moisture content bake up in the bread machine with a denser texture as opposed to a fluffy/spongy consistency---more like old fashioned home made bread.

                "reviewBody": "It was okay. Even when freshly baked the buttermilk \"tang\" was not pronounced and lessened quickly over time; a couple days after baking it was just a too sweetish white bread. Watch for over-proofing as with two packs of yeast and a quarter cup of sugar there'll be a lot (!!!!) of CO2 released. The both rises happen very quickly. Additionally this is a very dense bread; toast is about what it's good for.",
