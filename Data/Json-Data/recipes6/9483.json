Two things that I really liked about this recipe are the rich flavor that the chicken stock adds and the little kick from the fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers. I know many people add crushed red pepper flakes to collards but the jalape\u00f1os brought a different flavor (I added a pretty good sized pepper). And the fact that this is a slow cooker recipe keeping me out of the hot kitchen at dinner time is a bonus. Served with a splash of vinegar at the table. 3 D's Mom thanks for sharing your recipe we really enjoyed it.",
