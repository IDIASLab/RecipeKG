Also you don't have to dip the dough in milk to get the sesame seeds to stick. I did it with and without. The only difference is that the dough gets more heavily coated when dipped in the milk first but its so much more of a mess! The photo shown is without dipping them in milk. You can see they have plenty of sesame seeds on them. This is a great recipe that I will pass down to my daughters!",

Mine turned out fine but maybe it's because I make all of my doughs the day before so my cookies go into the oven a bit chilled from being refridgerated all night.

It's an unbelieveable combo of citrisy & vanilla flavoring like nothing you've tried before! It can be purchased on line. There should be a 10 star rating for this recipe!",

Instead of taking walnut size pieces of dough grab a handful of dough and roll it out on the counter until desired thickness. You can then cut the strip into 2\" pieces. This is the way I do Viennese Baton cookies and it goes very quickly. Do be sure that your hands are not wet from the milk once you get going. Thank you for this great recipe.",
