Also it was perfect because I had 2 leftover eggwhites that I needed to use up. I did use 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup and it still came out really sweet. I also used carob chips instead of walnuts as I did not hav any. Came out sooo good! The only thing I would say is that for some reason I felt that the batter was too little and it did not rise at all so I had a very thin brownie. I wonder if everyone got that result. They tasted perfect though! Rich chewy and so easy to make. Baked 30 mins as the recipe asks and that was enough.",
