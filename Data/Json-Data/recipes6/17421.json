Sounds healthy & the ratings are great.\"  SO>>>  I followed other reviewers & added about 1/4 Cup of food processed onions to the bubbling butter, then did the recipe as followed.  Added about 1 cup of shredded chicken to it & used Coconut milk instead of the 1/2 & 1/2, AND I used Indian Curry which made it near impossible for my children to feed their bodies so wonderfully as my hubby & me!  Made wheat rolls & topped the soup with the seeds & we were so satisfied, in & out!  This is a great, warm up your insides & get your nose running soup! So good for you too!  Thank you for this addition to my fave site!  Now this recipe card sits in front row in my soup slot in the recipe box!!!  ",

I made a few changes: I added one chopped yellow onion, and about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the curry saute, and I replaced the vegetable stock with chicken stock and the cream with evaporated milk because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. I'm sure this soup is great without any changes though! I also added a pinch of ginger. Served it with some warm crusty popovers. Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
