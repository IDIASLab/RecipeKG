I used chipotle salt and chipotle pepper on my pork chops before placing them in my frying pan that I had previously saut\u00e9ed some cut up mushrooms in butter and placed aside. I cooked over low med heat with the diced onions being added after the flip for two minutes on each side. In the meantime I mixed a can of condensed mushroom soup with 1/2 can 2 percent milk in a bowl. I added this mixture after arranging my sliced potatoes and mushrooms on top of the pork chops to my pan. After the first 15 minutes of simmering I stirred this mixture. I stirred up again after the second 15 minutes. The result was spicy so use the chipotle salt and pepper sparingly. The spicy flavor cooked through the potatoes and sauce. It was yummy with a lot of flavor and I will make it again.",
