                "reviewBody": "I should probably start off by saying that stroganoff is one of my favorite meals but I'm pretty picky about it. I looked through this website for a while looking for a recipe that looked good and not too complicated. This was the perfect sunday recipe, just layer and let it go for a few hours. I wasn't sure what wine to use so I just used the cabernet sauvignon I had on hand. I did follow the recipe except two small changes. When I was putting salt and pepper on the stew meat I also added a bit of paprika.  I also could not find dried chives so I just left them out. I think the way it was written the recipe is great, but it came out delicious my way too. None of the changes were very large. I just have a few things to point out. 1) warm the cream cheese up to room temperature to let it soften and consider breaking it into small chunks. 2) a tablespoon of paprika really adds some nice flavor to red meat dishes. 3) I really like a savory flavor so I might double the Worcestershire sauce the next time I make this. This recipe is definitely a keeper too. Satisfying, and quite simple but also I believe it is a bit healthier than some of the other recipes I have seen.  \n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve made this recipe many times now. Everyone I\u2019ve fed it to loves it.  I do add the paprika, and double the Worcestershire sauce. I add chives when I have them but that isn\u2019t a deal breaker to me. This is one of my favorite recipes to come home to after a long day.",

It has a hearty, rich flavor. I didn't have to adjust any of the seasoning, and the thickness was perfect, which doesn't always happen in a crock-pot recipe. I had all of the ingredients, and didn't change a thing. Looking forward to more recipes from Ann. Thanks, Ann!",

Made to the recipe for a double recipe and a single recipe leaving out onions and chives. Truly didn't make a lot of difference. The red wine was the answer to a full flavor! Awesome ,.. This will be my GO TO stroganoff from now on! Thanks",

If you have time, there are a few things you can do to make it even better. I seared the cubes of chuck in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a bit of vegetable oil until each piece had a nice brown crust (Don't buy \"stew meat\" in the package if it's more expensive per pound than a chuck roast, it only takes a few minutes to trim and cube it  yourself.) I transferred the browned meat to the slow cooker and reduced the heat to medium. I tossed in a couple tablespoons of butter and added the onions and a pinch of salt. Once the onions are soft and taking on some color, I tossed in the mushrooms and cooked them until they release their moisture and then get nicely browned. I then deglazed pan with the wine, and poured the mushrooms, onions, and wine to the cooker. The only other change I made was mixing the cornstarch and flour with water instead of the wine, since I used the wine for deglazing the pan. The result was even better than the first time I made it, so the extra steps are worth it, but this is super delicious if you just throw everything in the slow cooker. I served this mixed with some old-fashioned egg noodles, and it was to die for!",

However, I did make the mistake of adding 1/3 too much sour cream because I read the directions wrongly. Then when I taste-tested it, I found it to be quite bland, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra worchestershire sauce. In the end, it still didn't have quite as much flavor as I was hoping it would. I think I'll go back to my much more simple and much more flavorful stroganoff recipe, which is basically just some sour cream mixed with a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.",
