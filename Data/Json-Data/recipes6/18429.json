I made a few changes on the advice of others: I doubled the sauce ingredients, but I did not double the amount of vinegar. I substituted fresh lime and lime juice for the lemon, added about 2 tsp of garlic chili sauce to give it a little needed kick, and about 1 tsp soy sauce to take the edge off the sweetness. I decreased the peanuts by 1/2 cup to cut calories(just used a sprinkling on top for garnish) and added 1 cup of julienned carrots to the garnish at the end. With these changes, it tasted just like the Pad Thai I get at my favorite Thai restaurant.",

Changes:  double/triple the sauce recipe as the previous reviewers suggested, added 1 tsp red pepper flakes (we like it HOT), and 2 tsp garlic chili sauce.  We added a handful of shredded carott, fresh basil, fresh bean sprouts, about 1/3 lb spicy sausage (this is the way my fave restaurant makes it) and used Trader Joes Rock Shrimp.  I've also used chicken.  Perfect.  If you love spicey Pad Thai restaurant style, you will be very happy with this.  Good enough to entertain with.  Thanks Laura, and thanks previous reviewers!",

Next time I will use half the noodles double the sauce and half the bean sprouts and peanuts. The egg part is a little tricky and is probably best done by pushing all ingredients to the sides of the wok cooking the egg in the center until almost cooked scrambling the egg and then mixing with the rest of the ingredients. I served this with mango salad and it was quite nice.",

First don't substitute the fish sauce and all. That's what makes the sauce taste good. That's the base of most if not all Thai cooking. So if you don't use that don't even try this recipe. Second I scrambled the eggs then added the noodles then the sauce. If your noodles are too soggy it's either because you didn't use the right size noodles (I don't recommend the small size since they're too thin. Medium or large is best. If you can't find the variety at your regular grocery store go to an Asian store they'll have it.) Also don't soak your noodles in hot water or for too long. That makes the noodles too soft which once cooked will be too soggy. Your noodles are ready to be cooked once they're bendable but still have a slight crunch in them. Overall it wasn't too bad. I'd use it again.",
