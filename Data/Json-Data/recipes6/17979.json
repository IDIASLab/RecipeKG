I also used a frozen pie crust (the kind you roll out yourself.) \nFirst I greased a pie pan with unsalted butter, then rolled the pie crust out over it, and used about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 ghiradelli dark chocolate pieces to sprinkle a thin, single layer on the bottom of the crust. Then I baked at 350 for 7-8 mins. Then I mixed all the remaining ingredients and filled the pie pan + baked for an additional 30 mins. I chilled it overnight (about 8-9 hours) and the end result was absolutely divine. I am a cheesecake FANATIC, and in all honesty, this was the BEST cheesecake I've ever had. The Nutella taste was very evident, but the walnuts + hint of chocolate at the bottom added a turtle flavor to it. I opted for a regular pie crust instead so not to take away from the Nutella flavor. If you plan on making this, whichever way you choose, DO NOT USE SUGAR, and you MUST let it chill for at least 8 hours. It only gets better and better the longer it sits in the refrigerator. Nobody at my Christmas dinner table could keep their hands off of it.",

I made a few alterations because I didn't like the idea of using a graham cracker crust so instead a friend suggested making a brownie crust which turned out to be a great idea.  \r\n\r\nI make my brownies from scratch using the Deep Dish Brownies recipe on this site.  I cut the recipe by half and added about half a 7 oz jar of Nutella to the batter for taste.  Spread the brownie batter out in a pie pan and then baked the brownies for 7-10 minutes or until the sides were cooked.  Then I cut the recipe for the cheesecake a little by using only 10 oz of cream cheese (half reg/half light) and 1/2 cup of sugar and an egg.  Then I added the remaining Nutella into the mix, poured it unto the brownie crust and baked for 25 minutes.  I cooled it in the fridge for about 8 hours and the result was a dessert that was literally gone in 20 minutes!  It was a huge hit at the Christmas party I took it to and I had everyone asking for the recipe and blaming me for the Christmas weight they were going to put on!",

It may be ok for a spread on fruit or bread but it was awful in a pie crust. It wouldn't cut and you had to end up spooning it out and forcing it off the spoon.

I used 2 blocks of cream cheese 2 eggs 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 jar of nutella.(dont not add extra sugar) I baked this at 350 for 30-45mins. in a 8 inch spring form pan. For the crust i used chocolate cookie crumbles(eyeballed it) 1 egg white and 2 tablespoons butter and baked the crust at 350 for 8 mins. Let the cake chill for atleast a full day or more. The longer it sits the better it gets. This worked out very well and everyone loved it. I think it could used more hazelnut flavor. I'd suggest maybe adding chopped toasted hazelnuts. Anyways if you want a real cheesecake then turn this into a baked cheese cake.",
