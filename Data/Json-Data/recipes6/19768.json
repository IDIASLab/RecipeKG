The tomato and vinegar offset the sweetness nicely. I recommend starting with no sugar but add gradually to taste. I was also very unsure of what the papaya seeds would add-- I didn't know you could eat them. Our learning: yes they're great as used here but don't eat them alone!;-) My daughter & I each crunched one before adding to the recipe. Don't try this at home. A little like crunching a black peppercorn. But in the blender as part of the dressing they add a very unusual peppery flavor like cracked pepper. For those who had problems with watery-ness: brush your baguette slices with a touch of olive oil (or spray lightly) and bake 5 min so they're good & crunchy and definitely drain the salsa before spooning on. Thanks for a unique light app that will be used several times this summer!",

I don't eat processed or cooked food much so I used a good quality organic olive oil no sugar (addictive and highly processed) lettuce instead of bread (I am still looking for a good raw bread substitute and lettuce don't get soggy) and added dates to sweeten the sauce. It is true that a ripe papaya can make all the difference. Choose one that is mostly yellow soft but not mushy and heavy. Fresh ingredients are always best! I used basil tomato and papaya from my garden. With these adjustments it was wonderful!",
