I will never make cupcakes the \"old\" way again.  The filling is out-of-this world -- the slight tang of the cream cheese contrasts so nicely with the rich chocolate of the cupcake and the chocolate chips make it extra special.  I did cheat a bit -- I used a mix for the cupcakes, but you'd never know with the great filling!  By the way, this works equally well as a swirl-style filling for cake.  Just dollop the filling on top of the batter in the pan and use a knife to swirl it in.  Mmmmmm, it's so delicious and so easy!  I make the filling right in the same bowl as the cake mix -- just pour the cake mix into your cupcake pan or cake pan, throw the filling ingredients into the bowl, give it a quick mix, and dollop onto the cupcakes or cake.  So easy.  Definitely try this filling!",

Like others suggested, I hid the filling in the middle by filling the liner 1/3 full of batter, then added the cream cheese dollop, and then added another 1/3 of the batter on top.  It's really easy to create a \"pastry bag\" to fill the liners by using two plastic bags filled with the batter and the filling, cutting the tips off of the bags, and then squeezing out the right amount of each into the cups.  I did it like an assembly line and I was done in no time. It's a much neater way of filling the cups.",

These did come out very tasty; I like that fact that they weren't too sweet. My one major mistake was using foil cupcake liners. The cupcakes stuck to them and it was a pretty big process separating them. So, make sure you use paper liners or if you have to use foil  liners make sure you spray them with cooking spray first. I'm taking these to Easter dinner tomorrow, if they're a hit there then I'll definitely make them again b/c they were very easy to make.",
