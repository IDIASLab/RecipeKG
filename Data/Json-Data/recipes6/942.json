They don't have that smooth, slightly moist top most muffins have. The interior is soft, yet extremely dense. The exterior is slightly hard and has more of a crusty texture. The batter is very thick and the way it is spread is the way it bakes up. So consider that, if not spreading smoothly on top. Only change I made was using mini chocolate chips, pumpkin spice for the nutmeg, and King Arthur white whole wheat. These would fit most diets. The calories are also quite low for a muffin. Might be good with some coffee.",
