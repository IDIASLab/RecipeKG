Oh My ... DELISH! I will make bean soup again for sure. I was skeptic as to the igredients it called for and reviewed a few other recipes on this site as well, I followed this recipe to the letter adding some brown sugar as well and I followed suggestions from other users to add the baking soda. I used more ham then what the recipe called for only because of the memories of bean soup as a kid. Let's just say that my own children will have terrific memories of bean soup when they get older and will probably want this recipe from me when they get older. :O) Thanks so much for sharing this!!",

This is not traditional ham and bean soup.  It is very good, but I gave it two stars because of how far the base flavors stray from norm.  If you are going to change it this much it should be called \"southwest style ham and bean\" or something.  With the chili powder and significant tomato base, it taste a little more like chili than ham and bean soup.  I'm bummed I made this much soup with this flavor when I was in the mood for something more chicken/hammy flavored.  I make a big pot of chili when I'm in the mood for these flavors.",

Cooked ham and beans in crockpot alone for the first 4 hours, then added the rest for the next 4 hours since we don't like our veggies real mushy.  It was PERFECT!!!!  We are huge soup eaters and I have some good and not so good bean soups, but this is probably the best!  I was a bit worried about all the tomatos and veg. juice turning this into a spaghetti like recipe, but it made a hearty stock with just a hint of tomato.  I think all the other seasonings added to it are the perfect mix.  This is absolutely a keeper!!!!!!!!",

I started in my slow cooker (that I think is pretty big) and had to move the soup to my largest stockpot because I ran out of room.  Since I ran out of room in the slow cooker I also ran out of time to cook it in the evening and had to cook it for a couple of hours in the evening, put it in the fridge and then finish cooking it the next day. It still turned out great! Definitely the best ham and bean soup I've made. Thank you for the recipe!",
