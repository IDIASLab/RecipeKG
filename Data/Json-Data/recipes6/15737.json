I made the mistake of rolling out the dough on floured aluminum foil which made it difficult to lift up and just gather (i.e. the dough got stuck to the foil). So using a baking sheet as the directions say is best. Also I think that the syrup is on the sweet side but it tastes perfect when eaten with the apple and the dough:) I can see vanilla ice cream topping off this dumpling perfectly.",

It could've been a cinnamon-y flavor carrier but instead it was like a gelantinous overly-sweet goo. It need cinnamon and nutmeg badly.The red food coloring made me feel like I was eating melted candy. Not good melted candy either. 2.) Unless you're looking for a biscuit-type of consistency this pastry was much too soft. The biggest reason is probably that there's just too much baking powder in this recipe. If you use this amount that salty almost carbonated flavor you'll taste is leavening. I'd use 1/2 tsp. if I made these again. 3. I felt the baking time and temp was off. I used Jonathan apples and they were still very firm after 35 min. while the pastry on the bottom of the dumpling was still slightly doughy. Maybe trying a higher baking temp (400 for the first 15 min and then 375 for the last 15) would make the apple nice and soft and the pastry crispy.",
