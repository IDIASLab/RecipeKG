Now I just put everything into a mixing bowl and use the mixer.  I don't even bother to melt the butter, just pour the boiling water on top of everything and go!  This becomes the first step of my recipe.  I actually baked two of L.J.'s cheese cakes, one with the name brand canned product and one with the substitute recipe.  We really did prefer the cheese cake made with the substitute.  It was much thicker, creamier, and had a very rich taste! (If I want a \"healthy\" dessert, I eat fresh fruit!) I use regular dried milk as opposed to \"instant\" dried milk.  I would not thin it out, as I would be afraid that my dessert would not set up properly!!  Thanks for sharing!!",

Not only is this such an easy recipe, but it tastes SO much better than the canned stuff! I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and I put the liquid ingredients in my mini blender before the dry ones, because several reiviews said that would be helpful! It turned out to be the perfect consistancy and tasted amazing! Some people said theirs turned out gritty from the powdered milk, but I think it depends on the brand of powdered milk you use. I have always used the store brand because of the expense, but I recently bought some from www.providentliving.org for my food storage and it was WAY better. It was very refined and powdered, whereas the store brands did tend to be more granulated. I think it made a huge difference in the way it turned out! Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Make sure you do it quickly, I did mine in a food processor, let it run until the sugar was dissolved, sometimes stopping so the processor dosen't over heat. Perfect, smooth condensed milk.
