I thought that too till I found out differently; you'll notice that one half of the pans has tiny air holes in it. You put the whole cake batter into the (well-buttered) half that doesn't have the air holes which is the bottoml it will be full. Then you put the other well-buttered half pan over it and snap the two together. It's probably wise to get a piece of string and tie it too. Then you bake the whole thing in the oven and it rises up into the top half. You can look online for a recipe to do this if you like; I'm not sure how long it takes. You can also stick a toothpick through one of the airholes to check doneness. After you take it out cool it completely before removing from the mold. This way the cake is a whole lamb! I'm not sure if this will work with a cake mix pound cake is traditional because it has more tensile strength.",

We now add an instant pudding mix to a box cake mix to get the heavier \"poundcake\" like density. After unmolding the cake. cooliing it; I put it in the freezer to let to harderned a bit before I ice it. Then I sprinkle on coconut add raisin eyes and nose plus royal icing flowers. Next a tiny ribbon is added and tied around the neck. Back it goes into the freezer. When totally frozen it is wrapped in syran wrap then replaced into the freezer. At Easter it reappears in a table display and eaten after brunch. It is not unusual to make 5 or 6 to give to friends.",
