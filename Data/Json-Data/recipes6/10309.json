When using WW flour and oat bran it is important to add Vital Wheat Gluten this recipe needs at least 3 Tablespoons of VWG. Also if you hydrate the oat bran first and then add to the dough you will have better results. Both Oat Bran and WW flour really suck up the water take that into account when kneading and don't add all the flour at once. I proofed the yeast with about 1/4 cup of water soaked the bran in the remaining 3/4 cup warm water. I still needed to add more water to the dough. The Vital Wheat Gluten makes all the difference in the world.",

I baked this bread for almost an hour and it was still doughy in the middle. Also although it rose well during the first rising period it didn't rise at all in the oven. It came out as flat as a pancake. And it tasted of nothing but molasses. I wish I could give this recipe less than one star - more like minus five stars.",
