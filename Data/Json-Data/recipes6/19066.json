I also used margarine instead of butter and and I swapped out the buttermilk for 3/4 cup of skim milk mixed with 1/4 cup of fat-free sour cream. Splenda instead of sugar and whole-wheat flour completed my transformation of this recipe. Grandma also made it a bit softer so I brushed it with melted margarine before baking it and shortened the baking time to 6 minutes.",
