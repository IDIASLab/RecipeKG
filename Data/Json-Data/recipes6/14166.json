Here's what I did....substituted milk for the water, used 1 cup peanut butter, added 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 c butterscotch chips and 3/4 c coconut.  They were soooo good!!  I also baked them for about 12 minutes.  Leave them on the cookie sheet for several minutes before putting them on the cooling grid so they don't fall apart.  My cookies didn't look anything like the picture, but more like a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Great recipe!!",

Mine looked nothing like the ones in the photo, but were still quite edible :) My batter was of a great consistency, I had no problems with this recipe (unlike other people did). Might add chopped pecans to them next time, for extra crunch. Yes, we'll be having them again! I also froze half the mixture to cook at a later date and that worked really nicely too. I chopped slices of the frozen dough and baked as per the directions. Yum!!!",
