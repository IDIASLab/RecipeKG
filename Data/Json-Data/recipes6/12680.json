It calls for dried cranberries, I used the fresh, I rinsed them and put them in a glass dish on 250 degrees for 5-10 mins to soften them up.  Then I folded them carefully into the dough right at the end!!  I took them for thankgsgiving, they were gone before anyone even sat down to dinner.  The cranberries popped open in your mouth.  Absolutely the best cookie I've ever made or eaten!!!",

It makes it special.  I always double to recipe and decrease the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup of both white and brown sugars.  I also use margerine (I Can't Believe its Not Butter)and add a box of Cheesecake flavored pudding.  Cook as Diane suggested, just until barely brown and leave on the cookie tray (I use stoneware) for 3-5 minutes.  They will be scrumptious!  I cannot tell you if they are dry the next day, as some suggest b/c ours never last that long!  BTW, the dough freezes beautifully.  I just drop it onto a cookie sheet with my \"scoop\" and freeze it.  When baking the frozen ones, put them on the cookie sheet when you preheat the oven and they will be ready to bake when the oven is ready.",

Since I hate it when cookies spread too thin (I feeled like I've failed somehow), I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening - still delicious! Used just a little less sugar - 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and did not grease the cookie sheets which keeps them from spreading too much. I ended up with beautifully rounded, chunky cookies chock-full of crunchy, chewy, creamy bits - yum. 8 minutes baking and no more.",

I layered the jar as follows: 1/2 c. brown sugar (well packed & pressed down into the jar), 1/2 c. sugar, 1-1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 3/4 c. white choc. chips, & 1 c. dried cranberries.  As long as you are consistant using the exact ingred. and slightly pounding the bottom of the jar on the counter, all the ingred. fit perfect into a quart size jar. Also, I found that using a hand made funnel out of paper helped a lot.  I added a pretty Christmas fabric to the top and made a little recipe card that I tied to the outside of the jar: 1.\tEmpty cookie mix into large mixing bowl.  Use your hands to thoroughly blend mix. 2.Add:  \u00bd cup butter, very soft; 1 egg, slightly beaten; 1 Tbsp. brandy.\r\n3. Mix until completely blended.  You will need to finish mixing with your hands. 4. Shape into walnut sized balls.  Place 2\u201d apart on sprayed baking sheet. 5. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 mins. in preheated oven.  Remove to racks to cool. Makes 2 dozen.\r\nI enjoyed putting these together and giving them as gifts.  I received such wonderful responses from the receivers and the ones that have made the cookies.          \r\n",

I was so proud of them, I made up cookie gifts for my neighbors :)  I truly believe this cookie is one fo the best cookies I ever tasted.  I used dried sweetened cranberries.  I couldn't find any dried cranberries that weren't sweetned (don't really know for sure if there is such a thing anyway),  but I will make sure I get the same kind of cranberries next time as well.
