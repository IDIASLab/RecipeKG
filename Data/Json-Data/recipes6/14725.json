If you don't have self-rising flour (as I didn't), use four cups of all-purpose flour, two teaspoons of salt, and two teaspoons of baking powder (in addition to the tablespoon that's already called for).",

                "reviewBody": "I used to bake biscuits for a fast food restaurant and I have some tips for those of you that have never made biscuits or that are struggling to get them right. 1. Never over-work your dough. Mix it only as much as you absolutely have to or it will be tough. 2. Don't add too much flour! flour can be affected greatly by the humidity in the air so what works today may not work tomorrow. Biscuit dough should NOT be easy to work with, it will be pretty sticky. If you add enough flour so that it is easy to work with your biscuits will be dry. 3. Your shortening should be left in small chunks (about the size of a pea) so that your biscuits will be flaky. You can substitute a little butter for part of the shortening to give a richer flavor but your biscuits won't raise as well.  4. Roll your biscuits to at least 1/2 in thickness (or more) to have nice high biscuits. When you cut them push straight down and straight back up. Twisting the cutter will cause your biscuits to raise unevenly. This is a good biscuit recipe, flaky and delicious but I'm still looking for the perfect flavor. ",

I let the dough set in the fridge for a couple of hours to ensure the biscuits would rise high. I rolled out the dough on a lightly floured surface cut out the biscuits and placed them onto parchment paper to bake. Instead of buttermilk I brushed the tops with melted butter. These smell great and taste even better. What's great is the leftovers are perfect with breakfast the next day!",

That review said to use 4 cups of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of baking powder (in addition to the tablespoon that's already called for). That was perfect! I had some guesswork with the temperature though. I have dark non-stick pans which means that you lower the oven temperature 25 degrees so I set it to 375. The biscuits got VERY dark on the bottoms (almost burned) but the insides were still doughy. On the second pan I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan then raised the temperature to what the recipe called for - 400 degrees. Perfect! The bottoms weren't burned and the dough was fine. Thanks for the recipe!",

The only thing I changed was brushing the tops with butter instead of buttermilk. We loved the buttery salty taste on top of the biscuits. These rose beautifully. Looked like the ones on TV. Picture and taste perfect. OH and these freeze great! I tested them. I got to the cut dough part and froze individually on a sheet and put in bag. Then when I wanted a couple I just put directly in oven and baked as instructed. Yum!!!! Thank Sandra for posting this recipe. Sherry from Tennessee",
