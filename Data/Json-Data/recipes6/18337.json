I crumbled them into small to medium pieces and mixed them with the remaining ingredients.  After baking, the graham cracker pieces were almost caramelized and delicious!  I spread it out on a well greased cookie sheet and underbaked it a little.  Next time I will definitely bake it for the full 15 minutes.  I will also add a little more graham crackers because there is plenty of brown sugar mixture.  The graham crackers are good enough just to snack on.  I skimped a little on the salt but will use the full amount next time because the little bit of salt that you get every now and then is great with the sweetness of the brown sugar.  This is a must try recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but I like my instructions to be a little more specific so I minimize the chance of screwing things up. I finely crushed most of the crackers leaving a few bits bigger for contrast. I shouldn't have dashed it with salt - I used salted butter and it seemed a little salty - my mistake. Also I underbaked based on other reviews and the fact that I pre-made it for later in the day so I could reheat it before dessert. After initial prep and before baking it seemed a little sweet so I added one more graham cracker. Go ahead - it can take it. I also don't think you need to sprinkle with the white sugar but if that's your thing go for it. It tastes like a very sweet graham cracker crust (key lime cheesecake etc.). I think next time I'll cut the sugar topping out bake it lower and slower for more crunch and throw them in a homemade s'mores ice cream or cheesecake ice cream recipe. That would be tasty because most graham crackers dissolve when mixed into ice cream. Not bad!",

This topping was great over out homemade vanilla ice cream but it didn't get too crunchy until after it had cooled completely. Still I think it tastes 100 times better warm. To heat up the topping simply heat it in your toaster oven in a small metal tray or on aluminum foil. This topping tasted a lot like the crumbly topping on many apple pies and also had a hint of a toffee flavor.",
