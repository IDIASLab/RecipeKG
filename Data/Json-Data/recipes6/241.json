I made no other changes. I made muffins out of this recipe instead of one big loaf, I did get exactly 12. Baking them at 350*, they were done at exactly 20 minutes. These were VERY moist and the perfect muffin-texture, I think the only thing I was missing was more spice. I will make these again but double the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.",

As I was out of raisins, I used dried cherries (currents or dried cranberries also sound like a delicious possibility). I do not like nuts or seeds in breads so I left those out. Because I did not have mini loaf pans and I wanted to bake this \"like..now!\" I had to use two regular-sized loaf pans. Novice bakers should know that they will need to drastically increase the baking time if they do this. \n\nNext time I am going to use fresh ginger instead of dried for that extra zip that it provides breads and muffins. \n\nI will be making this recipe, with the changes I mentioned, for Thanksgiving presents for all of my family. -Chaya",
