I halved the recipe used half whole-wheat flour cut down the sugar to 1cup ( half white half brown) and used pumkin-pie-spice instead of nutmeg. My batter was pretty thick so I added a splash of milk and about 1/4c apple sauce to add moisture. The batter was plenty for 15 cupcakes-size muffins that rose beautifully and were done after 24mins. The muffins were absolutely delicious!! Very moist and rich. I did the calorie count and one muffin came down to only 150kcal!!! Next time I'll try substituting half the sugar for sweetener to cut down on the calories even more. Can't believe something this moist and decadent is actually fat-free!! Will be making again!",

I only used 1 1/2 cups flour because for 12 muffins that's usually what I use and I was afraid the muffins would come out dry if I added more flour. Baking these at 350 my muffins were done at just about 20 minutes. Thirty minutes and I would have had overdone muffins. These turned out okay but they didn't have much flavor. I think if I were to make these again I'd increase the spices (like maybe use pumpkin pie spice) and I'd use some kind of fat (melted butter or vegetable oil) or even some cold brewed chai instead of plain water.",
