The title though is quite misleading: not that is matters to people over there but Jule Kage is actually Danish (yeas there IS a difference!) and in pure Sw it would be Jul Kaka. Although similar this is more correct. Curiously I have never heard about a \"kage\" like this being of Swedish tradition.I guess it actually is Danish and that the author has mixed up the countries. So try it and enjoy the smells; and give it the title \"Jule kage - a Danish cardomom bread\" OR \"Jul Kaka - a Swedish c. b.\" Merry Christmas. God Jul! Josquin",

It's VERY expensive and the pungency will fade from purchase date to the next year. I keep my bottle tightly capped put it in a ziploc freezer bag and keep it in the freezer. It is also used to season \"krumkage\" which is similair to a pizelle OR waffle cone that is cooked and rolled around dowling while hot. Good stuff!
