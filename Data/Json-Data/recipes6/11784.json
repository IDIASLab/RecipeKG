I used the whole 10 oz. box of broccoli and added some half and half to compensate. I also added about 1/2 cup crushed saltines. This is a delicious side dish. Next time I will use American or some other \"soft\" cheese in place of the cheddar. It didn't melt to my liking and I think it would have been better with a more gooey type cheese. I highly recommend this recipe it's a nice change from plain scalloped corn. Very tasty and smells great when it's baking.",

I play quite a bit with the recipe substituting different cheeses etc. so you can get many variations out of 1 base recipe. I omit the sugar as it is sweet enough without. I add a pinch of salt and a good grinding of fresh pepper. I have also used Gruyere cheese instead for a bit more kick. I use fresh broccoli and I have also substituted frozen corn when I don't have canned creamed corn on hand. I add some milk to the combined ingredients to give it the custard consistency. I have also thrown in some cauliflower. This recipe is now in my repertoire. Thank you JM.",
