I also used about half the baking soda and added a tsp of baking powder plus a couple of Tbsp of oil.

Will try half the soda and 2 tsp baking powder instead like my other cakes - there's no acidity in the recipe so I don't know why the soda's there! Also 1 tbsp of cloves is entirely too much maybe 1 tsp? I substituted the soy flour for an equal amount of ground hazelnuts and left out the almonds currants and tapioca starch. The consistency is a good one though.",
