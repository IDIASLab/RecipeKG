I used milk chocolate and white chocolate. People have commented on the layers not coming out right this is what I did. I put the chocolate mixtures in 2 separate measuring cups. I poured milk then white next to each other. 4 across and 4 down. I took a toothpick and swirled together. They came out swirly and very yummy! VERY gooey just the way I love em!",
