My sauce tasted good when I tasted it but refused to thicken very much and I ended up drizzling it over my roast. It ran off the meat and so there wasn't enough to taste properly over the hogget I used. I also had more than a litre of sauce left and as raspberries are expensive I was disappointed. I would not make this recipe again because it is too expensive for the end result but I have frozen the excess sauce and will use it on another roast and see if I can get it to a better consistency. The taste was worth 4 stars but the consistency only two I'm sure the sauce should have gone thicker than it did but it just didn't.",
