Didn\u2019t realize it until I got started, but I was out of brown sugar, so I had to sub Splenda\u00ae Brown Sugar blend.  It worked fine, and I even saved a few calories.  This syrup was the perfect topping today for Easy Banana Nut Pancakes, also on this site.  Very nice option for pancake syrup.",
