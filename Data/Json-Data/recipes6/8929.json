My parents and I all thought it was very good-- it would be especially good as a breakfast casserole.  By the way, I couldn't find an oven temperature listed, so I put it in at 275 for 30 minutes.  But I rate my recipes by whether or not I think I would get an immediate proposal of marriage if I served it to a date.  It was very good, but probably not worthy of a marriage proposal.",
