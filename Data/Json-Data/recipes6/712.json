I suppose I will give it a second try at some point in the future. In any case I'm not sure this recipe is the best use of such quality ingredients. Combining two great things - avocado and bacon - sounded like a great idea but topping two fatty ingredients with a butter-based sauce just went too far for my taste. I feel the dish needs something dynamic to counterbalance the overwhelming amount of fat.",
