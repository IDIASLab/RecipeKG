Since my receipe had been handed down over the years I wasn't able to replace it until now.  Pulling the mints make all the difference.  My mother and I used to make a double batch and hers were always better.  She always got more pulls in than I did.  This is a fun receipe to make with friends.  The success isn't in the receipe but in the candy maker. If you fail the first time try again.",

We'd make mints of different colors. We'd make flavor varities such as spearmint (our favorite) as well as raspberry strawberry vanilla etc. We'd have different colors for each flavor. Warning: you will really need a candy thermometer to determine candy temperature. Be careful mixture is HOT and I burned my hand once while trying to pour it. You also have to work VERY FAST with pulling the candy and cutting it before it sets up because it starts setting up fast. It's best to have several family members present to help because it \"moves fast.\" Great recipe for inexpensive gift giving. I think we'll try it again this year!",

One last trick that my grandmother swore by - make these on a sunny day. If you make them on an overly cloudy day they won't turn out right. The humidity level effects the candy and they usually \"turn to sugar\" as she called it (the candy is very grainy and not the smooth melt in your mouth texture that it should be).",

I also covered the pot for the first 3 minutes or so to wash any crystals down the sides. I found that the recipe needs a little more peppermint flavoring - not strong enough for my taste! Also while it tastes good it's not quite the light and fluffy melt-in-your-mouth mint I was expecting. This might be because I only heated it to 265 - next time I'll go all the way to 280!",
