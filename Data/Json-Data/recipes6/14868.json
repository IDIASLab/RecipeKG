It tasted delicious- even with the malt vinegar! I would recommend this to anyone. However my only problem with this was that the pavlova stuck to the parchment paper and it crumbled while trying to pull it off. Still delicious and when it's covered in whip cream and fruit no one knows it's broken:)",

Due to the confusion mentioned in the reviews I compared this recipe to others and decided to bake mine at 300 degrees for an hour. Then turned the oven off and let them sit in the oven for another three hours. Even though I made smaller individual pavlovas by tracing a custard dish mine still weren t totally done in the very middle where they were hard and chewy. I dusted my parchment paper with cornstarch as mentioned in another recipe and I didn t have any sticking issues. I would have preferred these to be whiter in color but I think the malt vinegar and perhaps the vanilla made them more beige than white. The taste was very good however.",
