To toast the coconut just spread it on a baking sheet, and bake it at 350 for 5-10 mins, stirring a few times. I also used rice krispies instead of cornflakes the second time, and I liked it much better. Great recipe!",

I did make a few changes in order to make them a bit healthier...I used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup melted honey (just mixed in at same time as sugar) I added 1/4 tsp. baking soda (because of honey) and instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of apple sauce. I then cooked them on a lower temp. (just below 300 F) for 18-20 mins. I will definately try again with more honey and less sugar. Great recipe, thanks a bunch!",
