Honey was the predominant flavour but it was still buttery. One of those where you have a bite and say \"yup that's a good tart but what's different?\" I thought all butter tart batters were runny. This one was not so don't panic. I also just can't bring myself to eat raisins so I tried chopped walnuts instead. It was a good sub. Safe to say I'd make these again! Hubby gave them 4 stars kids 4.5 I gave them a 5 and I win! Thanks KIM BOYLE!",

I followed the recipe exactly as written and i wouldn't change a thing about it. I did spray a measuring cup with a nonstick spray so the honey would slide out easily and that is my only tip. Lemon zest might me a nice little touch in addition to the lemon juice. I would love to try these with some flavoured honey that you can buy from the Farmer's Market in the winter. This is a keeper! Thanks for the Recipe Kim! Whoops with the excitement of writing this review about these DELICIOUS Tarts i forgot that i only ended up using 1 cup of Brown sugar i though it would be sweet enough with the honey as well.",

I have more of a savoury palate so to me they were way too sweet. For those like me I would suggest to cut back the sugar and maybe add some nuts. My kids (who are adults) and friends thought they were only a little bit too sweet but they loved them and gave two thumbs up nevertheless! Great easy yummy recipe Kim Boyle thanks!!",
