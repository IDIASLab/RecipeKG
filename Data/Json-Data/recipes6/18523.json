The dough itself is not very sweet, which can be nice so they are not too sweet. I also added a little bit of sugar with the yeast and water to allow the yeast to activate a little faster. My kids and I had a lot of fun rolling and cutting these out. Will make again. I covered mine with melted chocolate and powdered sugar! They were really good!",

About 1/4 tsp gives you that nice little hint of taste. In no case, however, would I ever put in more than 1/2 tsp, and that's if you really like nutmeg. If allowed to rise properly, then slid into the oil with the exposed side down you will have lovely, puffy, light treats. Just take care not to be too impatient and fry the cut donuts without waiting for them to rise sufficiently. That second rise can make the difference between light donuts and \"sinkers.\"",
