        "description": "My family which is mostly German-Irish ate the same meal for New Year's every year of my life. It consisted of pork roast, sauerkraut, kielbasa and mashed potatoes. We ate the pork (pork roast and kielbasa) because pigs are a symbol of progress. Pigs push forward, rooting themselves in the ground before moving, and we need to move into the New Year in the same way. We eat sauerkraut, as it's believed it will bring blessings and wealth for the new year. It also reminds us that with the good comes the bitter as well. We eat potatoes to remind us that even as poor men we still had potatoes to eat.",

My better half is using just so-so about sauerkraut (I love it) but with the apple and brown sugar, it had a bit of a sweetness to it that she enjoyed and I thought was good too.   The roast came out juicy and tender.   This was the very first time ever that my  lady didn't go for steak sauce with a pork roast, which is a huge success for both my  kitchen and for this recipe.   Thank you for a great one.",

I cooked the roast pork with seasonings of salt pepper and garlic salt slow roasted for two hours with water in the bottom for the roasting pan. My saur kraut is made with four strips of bacon cut into small pieces 1 onion cut into small pieces also brown sugar to taste cooked for at least one hour until the sauce in the pan thickens the juices of the saur kraut. The gravy is made from the pan juices from the pork and served over Chateau bread dumplings found in the frozen food section of your store. Delish and a wonderful fall meal for those colder days.",
