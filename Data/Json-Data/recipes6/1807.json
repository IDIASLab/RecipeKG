I think I overcooked mine because it was a little dry and rubbery but the blueberries (I used frozen) were plenty juicy which gave it moisture and all was good in the end. The only thing that I didn't care for was the whole wheat flour and I will switch to all purpose white flour (personal preference) in the future. It may not have been pretty but it was big enough for two of us to split for breakfast and pretty tasty. Have to wonder if a little streusel topping on this might improve its eye appeal. This certainly has potential just need to get the timing figured out for your own microwave.",
