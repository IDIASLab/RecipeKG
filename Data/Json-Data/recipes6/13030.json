Then I roll each piece of cookie dough in powdered sugar place the cookie on the cookie sheet and press down with a glass dipped in powdered sugar. I bake the cookies for a few less minutes than the recipe calls for. This way the cookies come out a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside and stay that way even after they cool.",

I also mixed the butter-sugar-egg mixture on high until it was really light and frothy before I added the dry mixture. The cookies turned out flat yet chewy--very good texture and taste.
