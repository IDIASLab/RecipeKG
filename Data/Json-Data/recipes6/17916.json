My mom made it for us on Christmas (changed it to 1 C sour cream) and used a vanilla sauce that consisted of 1/2 C melter butter 1 C sugar 1 tsp Vanilla and 1/2 C evaporated milk...It literally melted in our mouths. We weren't so sure about the tangy-ness to it but once the vanilla sauce was on it it was AWESOME. So you may want to try it with the vanilla sauce.

I made it pretty much according to the recipe, though combined suggestions from two other reviewers (Thank you Justina & Dianna):  I added the zest of 1 orange (naval orange, I think) into step 2 (with the butter, sugar, cinnamon & cranberries); the juice of 1/2 an orange (naval) to the batter; and arranged seedless mandarin orange slices (about 2 oranges worth) in the bottom of the cake pan before adding the cranberry mixture.  I also made the vanilla sauce that Justina described in her review (1/2C melted butter, 1C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2C evaporated milk), but at the last minute zested another orange into it - it was divine!  It looked as delicious as it tasted!!  My only concern now is that people are going to expect that I can bake!!  Thank you AllRecipes & thank you reviewers - it was a huge hit ;)",

I also used only 3 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/2 cup it calls for & it was still quite buttery and sweet. So if anyone is calorie or sugar conscious you can probably even reduce a bit further than half and come out with a tasty cranberry topping. I've used a similar recipe from williams sonoma in the past and I may return to it as I found the cake a bit lighter. Also you don't need to fuss with a springform pan - I've used regular cake pans and aluminum pans and it turns out just as good.",
