One reviewer had stated that the breads are not called pregnant dolls I come from a traditional Italian family and my Grandmother refered to them as \"a fertal Goddess\" I think in reference to Spring being the time for new life. Which is why we have eggs for Easter. So all names lead to the same great bread.",
