The texture was a bit off from what I've had in Indian restaurants and I agree with another reviewer that it just wasn't very fluffy.  Next time I'd roll each one out a bit thicker.  Also for those reading the recipe for the first time, Ghee is a form of butter that is near the consistancy of oil.",

I didn't have access to a grill or oven, so I fried each piece of Naan one at a time in a frying pan and they bubbled up perfectly. I rolled out each piece to about a quarter of an inch thick, perhaps those who found the bread to be too tough rolled it out too thinly. This is my favorite naan recipe, and I have tried making it with various substitutions (milk instead of yogurt, olive oil for ghee, garlic and garam masala instead of onion seed, no seasonings, etc.) and it always comes out delicious. I find I have the best results when I use one cup of bread flour with one cup of all purpose flour, the added gluten gives the Naan a really nice texture perfect for sponging up curries and sauces.",
