Sorry - I usually try to come up with something nice to say but I can't with this recipe. My advice to anyone searching for a good muffin recipe - keep looking. The alterations may help some - but not enough. Save yourself the hassle.",

But with the changes they were delicious. They tasted like bakery muffins! The dough was not as thick as I thought it would be so I didn't need to add extra milk. Thank you to all of you who sent in your reviews. They are always a big help! I will make these again sometime!",

Instead of 3/4 cup milk I added 1 cup and I used regular semisweet chocolate morsels instead of mini - but apart from this I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I did end up with way too much leftover sugary topping though so I would suggest mixing 2 tbsp white sugar and 1 tbsp brown. I also sprayed the muffin tin with Pam (with Flour for Baking) AND gave a quick spray inside each paper liner which I credit the ease of taking these muffins out. 20 mins in the oven is all it took for these babies to come out perfectly puffed and sugared.. This recipe is def. a keeper for chocolate chip muffins - Thanks Nora!",
