I assumed, like most pie recipes, this would not make full pies, I was wrong, this recipe produces generously filled pies! Other than that, I BAKED the potatoes instead of boiling them (I peeled the whole baked potatoes after they had cooled halfway), I added a few dashes of cinnimon and a dash of ginger, plus about an extra 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and reduced the sugar (I used 3 cups of sugar for a DOUBLED recipe). I wish I would have reduced the eggs, this turned out to be much fluffier than I wanted. I wanted a denser, more custard-like pie (like pumpkin pie), and this recipe made a light, fluffy pie. It is a good basic recipe though, and I feel I can work with it until I arrive at the type of pie I want, by reducing the eggs, using half brown sugar next time (in the same reduced amount), and by adding more spices, maybe even some allspice. I also cooked the three pies at 325 degrees for one hour on the second oven rack down from the top (so the pies were closer to the top of the oven), and they came out beautiful, the crust did not get too dark, and they were lightly browned on top, just like I like them.",

I average 8 - 10 or pies at each baking and can use nearly a dozen eggs or more in my batch of mix.",
