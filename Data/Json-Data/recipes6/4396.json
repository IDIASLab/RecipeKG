I thought the 2 envelopes of onion soup mix might be too much but boy was I wrong. This was very good. It has a nice blend of flavors and textures. The crispy noodles on top and the water chestnuts add the right amount of crunch. My husband told me he wouldn't mind if I made this once a week!!",

They call it my 'homemade Rice-A-Roni', and will not eat the boxed version anymore!  This dish is MUCH better!  When making it for a dinner party, I make it the day before.  I under cook it by several minutes, let it cool, cover it, and stick it in the refrigerator.  An hour before I am ready to serve it, I take it out of the refrigerator, and let it get to room temp. Then I pour about 1 cup of extra broth all over the top of the rice to moisten it.  Cover with foil, and cook at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Check for heat and doneness, adding more broth if needed.  Comes out perfect every time!",
