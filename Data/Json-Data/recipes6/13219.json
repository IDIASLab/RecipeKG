It is the two eggs that give it that soft texture, but you only really need one.  Also, I cut the sugar down to only 1/4 cup. The corn syrup is plenty sweet on its own. Your teeth don't curl up from the sweet that way.  It was still plenty sweet.   I also used WHITE Karo syrup, effectively making a vanilla pecan pie. It was GREAT!    Last change that anyone can do to any pecan pie recipe they choose to use:  CHOP the pecans.  I always had had the mindset that the pecans had to be whole to look pretty. They don't. I added 1-1/2 cups CHOPPED pecans (and a little extra) for a positively great pie that is now my daughter's favorite.",
