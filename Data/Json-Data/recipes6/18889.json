Those of you wondering what tahini is it's ground up sesame seed also known as sesame butter. You can't find it at a normal grocery store so try the local import store - it's a Middle Eastern thing (or if you're feeling bold grind up some sesame seeds). Dehydrated onions work fine for the onions. The tahini smells nasty just make sure that the marinade smells somewhat sweet and your meat will taste sweet. We also added a pinch of oregano. Excellent!",
