First, I doubled the recipe and made only two 8\" DEEP DISH pies from the doubled recipe, filling the unbaked crusts to the very top rim.\n\nSecond I baked the two pies for 12 minutes longer than the original recipe stated.",

Make sure you follow the directions as printed.  Once the batter is mixed, pour into the two crusts very fast.  The batter separates very quickly due to the 4 eggs and large amount of butter.  Cook the pies a little longer than recommended to make sure the center is cooked.  When you cut into the cooled pie, you should see two layers.  The chocolate layer on top and the custard layer that settles to the bottom.  I had to make this recipe several times to perfect it, but I get raves everytime I make it!  Be patient and measure carefully when you bake.  YUMMY!!!!",
