The noodles were broken up into small pieces (uncooked) & mixed with the cabbage mixture. The dressing was put on & mixed through last minute. She called it \"Oriental Cole Slaw\" & almost everyone who has tried it loves it. It is great for outdoor pitch-ins since there is no creamy dressing to go bad.",
