This recipe can be adjusted according to your taste preferences, so you can leave out undesirable ingredients or add others that appeal to you (like mushrooms). I add ingredients just to bulk up the heartiness and color palate of the chili, but feel free to just use a few green peppers or same-colored zucchinis as you desire.  By the end, you just want everything to be hearty, moist, and flavored -- mess around with it as you go! I would say to serve it with shredded cheese and corn chips, but then it's no longer 'vegan.'  : )",

I added a small can of chopped green chiles for a little zip, and used Great Northern beans instead of garbanzo (my kids don't like garbanzo beans).  I also use V8 juice instead of tomato sauce, and found that just one can of tomato paste makes it plenty thick.  This will be a regular at our house!  Thanks!",

It makes a ton and was delicious for days afterwards.  I only had one small can of diced tomatoes, but just added a little extra veggie broth to make up for the liquid that would have been in the canned tomatoes.  We have a large crock pot, and it almost didn't all fit!  For the reviewer who was worried about sodium, just check the sodium levels of your veggie broth, rinse your beans well (or use fresh and soak them overnight before), and/or omit the salt.  I can't see what else would be adding so much sodium. ALSO, I didn't saute any vegetables in olive oil first.  Just added all to the crock pot.  Not sure if that would have made a difference, but I doubt it.  Cooked 8 hours on low.",
