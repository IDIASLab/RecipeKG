I doubled the recipe so I could take dinner to a friend as well and it turned out to be a HUGE pot of food enough to feed both of our families dinner twice with more for a lunch as well! Because kids were going to be eating it I skipped the jalepeno and only added half the chili powder. It was not spicy at all, but it was still full of flavor! I did have to add some liquid, and I used a can of chicken broth (or half a can for a single recipe). I will definitely be making this again. EDIT: Now that I have made this a second time I will say that I believe that the flavor is much improved by cooking the quinoa in chicken broth (or vegetable broth if you prefer) instead of water. I think I did this without even thinking about it the first time because I almost always do when cooking grains. This time I didn't bother with it, and the flavor was not as good. I remedied it by dissolving some \"Better than Bouillon\" in a couple of tablespoons of water and stirring this into the finished chili.",

The chili was a tiny bit watery from the crock pot, but it thickened up nicely once I added the quinoa.  This is a really tasty and healthy recipe.

I only wish that I'd added some diced canned chipotles in adobo per the other recipe on here for \"Black bean quinoa chili\" b/c I think that would've added a special flavor that this seemed to be missing. Otherwise I was faithful to the recipe's ingredients but I put everything (save the cooked quinoa) in the crockpot b4 leaving for work in the a.m. and stirred the quinoa in when I got home. The quinoa balloons up so I only made about 3/4 c. and then it begins to absorb all of what remains of the liquid in the chili (which really is only that from the canned tomatoes) so I had to add a little water to counter the gummy thickness. With a sprinkle of cheese and a handful of cilantro this recipe has transformed us into quinoa chili junkies.",

The only thing I did differently was that I added about a cup of vegetable broth when I added the tomatoes as the chili was very thick and I didn't think it would hold the quinoa well. It was a little \"soupy\" but when I added the quinoa at the end it soaked everything up to create a thicker consistency (which I prefer when it comes to chili). My boyfriend would have liked it a little spicier so I think I will add a bit more kick to it next time. Overall a wonderful meal that I will be making again!",
