I made this cake for a friend's birthday and now everyone wants me to make their cakes from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!  DELICIOUS!\n\n**If you don't like dark chocolate, I would suggest using more of the semi-sweet to milk-chocolate squares instead.  It was a little too rich for me, but everyone else loved it.  Also, I used buttercream frosting instead of the frosting listed.  It gave me more room for creativity and evened out the bitterness in the chocolate.  For the raspberry filling, I cooked it with raspberry liquor, doubled the raspberries, raspberry preserves (seedless), and a little cornstarch to make it more of a gel.  I filled the cake and then used the rest for the the top. ",

The baking time is too much. The batter is very thick and brownie like and so I checked it every 5 mins after 25 mins of baking. A lot of people wrote that the cake was too crumbly. That might be because it was over baked or maybe the eggs weren't beat enough. I had to beat my eggs by hand. Also the filling was too little. 4oz is just not enough. I had 6 oz of raspberries. For every ounce of raspberry i added.75 oz jam. If some people want the cake to be sweeter strawberry would probably work. And the frosting. Some people said it was too thick that might be because the cream was boiled too long. And if it was too liquidy maybe it needed to cool more. My cake looked so pretty that I didn't feel like eating it. hehe. And as the title says the cake IS very fudgy...",

The cake comes out with a dry texture and a remarkably plain taste -- frankly the plain chocolate you use in the recipe tastes better than the cake. In addition it's a lot of fat for so little flavor. Furthermore preparation is quite hard especially folding the egg whites into the very heavy chocolate-laden batter. I do not recommend this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "There are other cakes out there that are easier to \"deal with\" and just as tasty, but if you want to give this cake a try here are a few things that I learned.  1) When whipping your egg whites add your sugar at the very end.  Your whites will form the soft peaks better when there is no sugar. 2) Frost the top of your top layer before assembling.  The raspberry filling oozes out - EVERYWHERE.  3)  If you want A LOT of raspberry filling (like I did) I found out that by making three layers I could make holes in the middle layer by using a small biscuit cutter (about the size of a quarter).  The holes held the filling and the \"leftovers\" make great bite-size cakes.  4) Make extra frosting.  Because of the egg white/meringue added to the batter the cake is crumbly (not dry)therefore making the cake very hard to frost.  With the frosting in liquid form spoon/pour small amount on the cake - spreading gently. You want the frosting to absorb into the cake - you'll have an ugly 1st layer.  Allow the frosting to cool; on the cake and the remaining amount in the bowl (do not put the frosting in the fridge it gets too hard).  Once the frosting no longer drips off your frosting apparatus you are ready for layer two.  HOPE THIS HELPS!",
