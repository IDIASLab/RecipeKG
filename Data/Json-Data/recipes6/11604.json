My husband however ate it up like it was his last meal ever! My tips: use less chocolate chips when mixing bake for 30 minutes & cover with a foil tent (stick a toothpick in the center & layer foil over it like a tent....otherwise the foil will stick to the pecans) then finish baking so you have a pretty golden pie. Thanks for sharing the recipe; will definitely make this again!",
