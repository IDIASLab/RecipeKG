You need to almost double the amount of chocolate you melt down to cover the bars to ensure getting a nice even layer. I used two extra bars and still didn't have enough. The only reason why I didn't give the Kid Friendly rating a 5 was because I didn't test this on kids. I made it for a work treat for my birthday. Although these guys could be considered kids I guess. Great recipe and I would definetely use it again!",

My neighbor likes semi sweet chocolate so I sprinkled chocolate chips (I don't think the chocolate amount in the recipe would do the trick) over the warm bars and covered with foil until they melted like someone else suggested in the reviews. Spread out the melted chocolate chill and you are done. Thanks for sharing!",
