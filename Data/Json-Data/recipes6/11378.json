No lemon tang\n\nWhat I'd do next time:\nUse only 1 cup sugar  (orig. 2 cups)\n6+ TBS lemon juice  (orig. 2 TBS)\nUse only 1 1/4 cup milk (depending on how much extra lemon juice added) (orig. 1 1/2 cups)\n\n I personally don't like zest (diminishes lemon tang/too bitter) but the cake part ,imo, was in need of something. So you just might want to maybe sprinkle some zest over top of cake just before baking.   \n\n",
