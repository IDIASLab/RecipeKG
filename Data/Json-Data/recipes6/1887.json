This well could be just a personal taste preference since we seem to like food less sweet these days. I bought a bottle of the McCormick Vegetable Seasoning just for this recipe and I can see using it a lot on steamed veggies which often can use a little flavor boost. This was a very good side dish to a baked Christmas ham and I would make again. Dana P thanks for sharing your recipe!",
