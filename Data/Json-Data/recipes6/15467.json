Remove from heat, strain, then add vanilla.  Cool in ice bath, then chill mixture several hours or overnight before churning. Almost as good, and certainly a lot easier because you don't have to cook it, is simply to beat the eggs till light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes, add the sugar, beat another minute, then add to cream mixture with vanilla. Whichever way you choose to do it, don't whip the cream. This will cause a lot of \"overrun,\" or air volume, which you don't want. (This is what the inexpensive brands of ice cream do) I wanted a clean vanilla ice cream flavor, so I eliminated the lemon juice and, since I like my \"frozen custard\" super rich, I used half and half instead of the milk.  So long as the step of whipping the cream is skipped, this is excellent ice cream.",
