Maybe I should have greased it? Should I have kept the cookies in the turned on oven for a few minutes before I turned the oven off? What I did in the morning is turn the oven back on for a few minutes on low and the cookies were ready soon after that. They came out delicious but I wish I didn't have to do that extra step. What did I do wrong? Also I think chocolate chips are extra I just added chopped almonds and a little bit of sugar and the taste was just right. Thank you for the recipe. Please give me more direction for I want to try this again.",

For the reviewer who had to turn her oven back on...is your oven gas? If so that's your problem. Electric oven coils retain heat for awhile after you've turned them off while gas ovens start cooling almost immediately. If it is a gas oven I'd preheat the oven then when you put the cookies in drop the temp to the lowest possible...they'll be ready in less than a few hours dependant on your oven.",

I was baking them for a breast cancer awareness fundraiser so I used red food coloring in the final mixing stages to make the meringue pink before folding in the mini semi-sweet chips and chopped peanuts and they took to a nice pink color. They also didn't spread when baking so I could pack the parchment lined cookies sheets closely with cookies and bake 2 batches simultaneously!

Sometime I get sidetracked cleaning something and they end up in there for a few minutes. Add food coloring red and green for Christmas.",

One this about this cookie though; I've had several people say \"Mine didn't come out that good!\" The BIGGEST keys are the parts of this recipe that mention ROOM TEMPERATURE and STIFF PEAKS. Too many people make it cold and go like \"Oh! This is close enough.\" Or make soft peaks and say the same thing.",
