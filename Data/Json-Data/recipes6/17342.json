Easy to make nearly foolproof. I can't imagine how you could goof up on a cake like this. The ingredients are conveniently and readily at hand and it mixes up in just a minute or two. Perfect for strawberry shortcake - individual cakelet pans would be so cool (I was too lazy) but this wasn't compromised at all just baked in an 8x8\" pan (for a half recipe baked about 20-25 minutes).",

I have already ate 2. This would make great strawberry shortcake and tastes like a cross between the little store bought short cakes and Twinkies. I didn't have any milk so I used half and half instead eliminated the butter and used more half and half to replace the butter. They bounced on the cooling rack when they fell out of the pans. One bounced off of the rack onto the floor to a grateful dog. My family and dog thank you for this easy to make 5 star recipe.",
