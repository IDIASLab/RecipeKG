They are not meant to to rise up a lot and have a light and airy texture like a yeast donut would. A tip for the thick batter is to use a pastry bag to pipe it into your donut pan. Use a muffin pan if you don't have a donut pan. \nAlso, as all ovens vary, you may have to adjust the cooking time a bit for these, or any recipe you make. I hope you enjoy them!",

The only changes I made were increased the recipe size to serve 18 (didn't want to waste pumpkin puree), substituted the Pumpkin Spice (didn't have it) and altered the glaze. I used 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger. I'm sure it would have been great with plain Pumpkin Spice, I just didn't have it. With my 1 1/2 TBSP scoop leveled out, 8 min baking time, rolled them over and cooked for another 30 seconds, this recipe made about 3.5 dozen doughnut holes with the recipe at 18 servings (a whole 15oz can of pumpkin). For the glaze I did use a reduced amount of milk instead of water and added a couple TBSP of corn syrup. This helps the glaze harden.",
