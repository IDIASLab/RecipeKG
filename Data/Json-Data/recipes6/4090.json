It boggles my mind that another reviewer would make gingerbread cheesecake--with strong flavors such as molasses and warm spices--and complain about a lack of cream cheese flavor. This has a perfect combo of tang from the cream cheese dark sweetness of molasses and a good hit of spices. If you want solid cream cheese flavor then eat a brick of cream cheese. If you want a cheesecake that tastes like a good gingerbread then make this cheesecake. (Also you can make the crust crisper by pre-baking it before adding the filling. Really quite easy to do. Otherwise you will have a rather nice soft chewy gingery cookie crust when made as written.)",
