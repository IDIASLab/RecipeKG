I made 12 servings for a friend's Cinco De Mayo party which was more than I expected yet most of it was eaten up mostly as a side dish but also as a main course for the two vegetarians at the party. Here's the changes I made to the four (4 ) serving recipe originally shown on allrecipes.com: Instead of 4 zucchini I used 2 zucchini and 2 butternut squash (for color). I used 1 can of Ro Tel tomatoes because they're lightly spicy and 1 tablespoon of cilantro. I then covered and sauteed until soft over medium heat stirring about once a minute. Then I stirred in the recommended amount of corn but reduced the beans by 1/3 about 10 ounces. While that mixture was heating I added the recommended amount of salt plus 1 fresh lime 1 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin. Continue to cook uncovered stirring about once a minute. I also found out it's just as delicious cold as warm. If you can let it sit for a few hours in the refrigerator and then thoroughly stir it and microwave it (or serve it cold) it tastes even better.",

I also added Texas Gunpowder which is dried ground jalapeno in a shaker. I needed more salt too. My husband eats this with sour cream on a tortilla and loves it (so do I).
