It's quick and easy and a great accompaniment to soup or stew.  Then the last time I made it I actually had self-rising flour on hand (usually I make my own substitute).  It was no where near as good when made with self-rising flour.  I highly recommend using this substitue:  3 cups all purpose flour, 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt.  I know it seems like a lot of baking powder, but if you like a buttery slightly salty bread you'll love it.  I also always use butter on top, not margarine as the recipe states.  Finally, if you have it on hand, dark beer makes this bread even better.",

This bread is much better and has a much bettter crumb to it.  Sometimes I add Italian herbs and garlic powder. If you have problems with the margarine/butter overflowing into your oven just make a slit down the center of the bread, before pouring it on.  It helps control the direction of the melted margarine/butter and helps for more even distribution too.",

You can substitute any flour you like but if it is not self-rising you'll need to use some baking powder. The beer reacts with the soda in the the baking powder to help make the bread fluffier. Try adding 4 T of baking powder to your dry ingredients if you are using a flour that isn't self rising.",

I've made it twice now, each time adding grated cheese and garlic and onion powder. The second time I added a bunch of dried herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano, thyme) and it was sensational! Next time I might try adding spanish chorizo. I love the crunchy/chewy crust that it forms! I have used both self-raising and plain flour + baking powder and room-temperature and cold beer and each combination worked out fine. GREAT recipe!",
