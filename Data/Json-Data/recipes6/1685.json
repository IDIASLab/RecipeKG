Perhaps this is best used as a 'base' recipe to which you would add your own raisins and/or walnuts? As is it just misses the mark. I wouldn't rule out this recipe in the future however if/when I make again I will certainly try adding some extra goodies to jazz it up. Tip:: Pop the shells into the oven for 5 minutes or so BEFORE filling them so that the shells can get a bit of extra cooking time (they'll need it).",
