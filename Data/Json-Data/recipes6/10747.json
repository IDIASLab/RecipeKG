The only things I whip together are the eggs sugar zest and oj. I then stir in the flour/baking powder and then gently fold in the whites. You should also NEVER grease the pan with a sponge cake and allow it to cool upsidedown for 1 1/2 - 2 hours in the pan before removing. Works very well in a tube pan-this particular recipe may need to be doubled for that.",

Sponge cakes are supposed to be dry that's why they're called sponge cakes. If you wanted something moist maybe you should make a regular cake. But above all else do NOT add oils and fats to a sponge cake it will not rise properly. Also don't grease the cake pan if you do it will become dense after coming out of the oven. If you're not sure if you can trust me I'm a patisserie and baking student at the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. So unlike those people that were complaining about the cake being too dry I actually know what I'm talking about.",

It smelled awesome coming out of the oven! I didn't think it tasted very orange-y but my family members thought it was perfect. I might add more zest next time. I would definitely make this again!",

I like to slice it in half and spread it with whipped cream that has had 100g of melted dark chocolate whipped into it. I then ice it with a dark drizzly chocolate icing. You could also spoon a little Grand Marnier onto the bottom layer before you put the cream on. This was my solution to a request for a Chocolate/Orange birthday cake!",

Cake did not want to budge from pan though so be sure to grease/flour really well! Is equally delicious with vanilla used as a flavoring instead of orange zest. I used this recipe (with vanilla instead of orange) for a ice cream cake for 4th of July and the results were delicious! I spread layers of vanilla ice cream and blueberry and strawberry sorbet. Then I froze. Then before serving I topped with whipped cream and bluberries and strawberries in a sort of flag shape. Worked very well. FYI sponge cakes work better for ice cream cake because the lack of butter (which I usually looove!) keeps the cake from becoming too hard in the freezer. I great all around sponge cake recipe. A keeper.:) Note 4 stars just because I'm SUPER! picky about 5 stars!:)",
