The flavors are pretty mild and the ingredients go very well together. And it's healthy! I substituted chicken instead of turkey but I'm sure it tastes similar. I also used 3/4c. of organic wild rice blend instead of a packaged mix. The slivered almonds add great texture. This is a nice salad to bring to a picnic or potluck too. I will be using this many times in the future.",
