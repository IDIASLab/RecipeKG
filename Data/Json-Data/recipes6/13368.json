My problem with the pie is that it didn't hold it's shape very well when cut and the crust was soggy on bottom. Was the pie filling too moist? I don't know but will try agian today. Also I followed the recipe and ended up with enough filling for two pies. (not a complaint )",

My only change to the recipe was to double up on the cinnamon and nutmeg and I probably used more lemon juice too. I could tell right off that I was going to have way more filling than I need for a 9\" dish so I used two of my smaller dishes and it was perfect. I say \"dishes\" because the crust will be soggy if you use a pan I am getting to be an old lady and experience tells me this. I have made a hobby of collecting pie dishes in all different sizes and depths so choosing the right one comes second nature now. I used parchment which I always have on hand for cookies fish and other dishes that I want to steam with other ingredients. Someone mentioned using a paper bag please don't use this unless your roasting a turkey it gives off an odor and even a taste to baking that it doesn't to turkey. Everyone loved this and it was a bit different with the crumb crust tasted very rich. My thanks to Judy Pusko for offering this unique method....it was a first for me!",

But when I made it just as described but the butter in the top \"crust\" laid on the top of the baked pie like pizza grease! Gross. The bottom crust was soggy as well. I let it then sit in the oven longer to try to fix no luck. Only thing I can guess is that my apples were very juicy?? Like the other reviewer I had enough apple filling for two pies. Guess my 8 apples were twice as large as the cooks? But even so both pies turned out very very poorly. And it is the night before Thanksgiving! AAAA! Not good.",
