Then I fry them in oil till the are cooked and top with fried onions. Then I make the pasta on the side. I use rotini noodles and top them with butter garlic and parmesan cheese. Its so good.

I use round steak instead of cube steak (not as tough and easier to handle) dredged in egg and then bread crumbs combined with parmesan cheese. After browning the steaks in olive oil add 1/2 c. chopped onion one can tomato paste (again for richness of taste) and 1 tomato paste can full of water to the skillet drippings. Blend well and cover steaks--eliminate spaghetti sauce. Bake the same as this recipe indicates. Fast easy and more flavorful in my opinion.",
