                "reviewBody": "I have to give this a 5 star!  I was looking for a recipe that emulated Martin's potato rolls. This didn't, however I loved the texture.  It was light and fluffy, yet had a heavier mouth-feel than I expected.  Very good.  The flavor isn't a strong potato flavor that I was going for, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The texture is also very good as hamburger buns.  My suggestion is to add a little more potato and instead of shortening, add vegetable or canola oil.  I also kneeded it for about a half hour, just because I got lost in thought and realized it when I looked at the clock.  proofed very nicely in a bowl using any pan spray with a damp towel draped across the top. personally, I let my breads proof in a warmed oven, and they rise amazingly well.  I took half of the recipe and made rolls, and the other half made a twist bread out of. (rolled it into an inch thick rectangle, cut the half dough in half, twisted two pieces, and repeated with the other side.   placed them side by side in the loaf pan tucking the ends under.  I'll take a picture before I slice into it.  I also use a double-egg wash.  1 egg with a tablespoon of water while dough is well... dough.  then just before finishing I brush it again.  \n\nAll in all, very well done, and tasty.  I can say it was a LOT easier to make in the kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook than it would have been to make by hand, but hey if you want to, go for it.",

                "reviewBody": "This is my favorite bread. I've made it twice in the past two weeks. The first batch I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with milk which I scalded and added butter instead of the oil called for. The second time I used only the water called for. I think using the milk makes a more tender loaf. I got two beautifully risen light and fluffy loaves from this recipe using only about 5 cups of flour. What I like most about this bread is the flavor. The yeast does not overpower the bread's flavor it's more of a back note which I think is perfect. I used the rapid rise yeast and reduced the amount to 3 1/2 tsp. Thanks Judy this will be made again and again my family absolutely loves it...and so do I.. BTW:..Do not expect this bread to taste like potatoes. Potato has a very neutral flavor. It's purpose is to fuel the yeast and add moisture and lightness to the bread. Make sure you use only enough flour to produce a slightly tacky feeling dough if you want the bread to turn out light and fluffy. About 5 /- cups of flour should work. Again feel the dough it should be smooth and tacky not sticky.",

My Aunt won the Colorado State Fair when she was in high school with a potato bread. I didn't have the recipe available but I remembered that it used dry milk. So I added in 2 Tbsp dry milk and it make it very sweet and smooth. The change that I would make is one suggested by another reader. She let hers rise longer before baking it to make it lighter. I agree you should double the time on the second rise. I made it 50% longer and I wish it was a little more. Also be warned you can only make 2 cups of potato from 1 potato if you have a huge tuber. I had to make up the difference with some emergency instant mashed potatoes. So I would correct it to say 1 very large or 2 medium potatoes. With just a few tweaks you will LOVE this simple bread. It makes great rolls too! (Just make sure to cut baking time down to 20 min).",
