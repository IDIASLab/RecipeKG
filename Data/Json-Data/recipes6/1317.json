I did so and added a little less water than called for because so many reviews said it came out thin. I otherwise made it as written except I tried to thicken it down by simmering it for a while which didn't really work. I even let it cool to room temp before I served it and it was still on the thin side but very tasty on French toast. I'll definitely make it again but I might try adding a little pectin like a 1/4 tsp to try and get it to thicken a little. I might even add some to the leftover syrup and see what happens.",
