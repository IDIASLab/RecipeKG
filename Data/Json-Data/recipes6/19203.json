Never again will I buy applesauce when I can easily make it.

Therefore, there is no exact recipe for anything involving apples.  With that said, this is a great basis to work from.  I used Cortland apples, which had a sweet taste and firm texture.  I tasted the apple mixture right before I was supposed to add sugar, and it was sweet enough so I left it out.  Then when it was finished cooking, I smooshed its with the back of the spoon to make it smoother, but still chunky.  A number of people commented it on not getting it smooth enough. Some advice: use softer fleshed apples, add more water and cook for longer, or use a blender, as previosuly stated. Over all this was a great way to make applesauce!",

This recipe tastes exactly like Mott's cinnamon applesauce which I LOVE but I can pronounce all the ingredients that went into it. I used 6 Fuji apples (I tried this with golden delicious and did not like it - I'm going back to Fuji or Cortland next time - the Fuji won't need any sugar) and 1/8 c sugar and probably could have gone without completely. I used 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon cause I love cinnamon and will leave out the cloves next time. I also might try throwing in some strawberries or other berry. I did need to cook it 5 minutes longer.",

I didn't have any cloves so I just used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice that tastes great. And I think next time I'd half the sugar but I'm one of those types to not like my food sweet.
