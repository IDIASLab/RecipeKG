I figure its better to try it, and then make adjustments that I see fit.\nI DID notice that it took longer than the 50 minutes in the oven, the middle was still liquid-y when I checked it at 45min. I left it in for a bit over an hour, then was scared that the edges would be a little burnt. \nWe've enjoyed a slice already since then- it was beautiful.

I had made a couple of changes to the recipe (using only two eggs losing the poppy seeds and adding more lemon zest) but I followed the cooking times and temperatures properly so I don't see how that could have made a difference. Anyway to remedy this I sliced off the burnt-ish outsides turned the cakes upside down and covered the whole thing in a glaze of lemon juice icing sugar and a little butter. The cake soaked up the glaze so the outsides had extra sweetness the inside was moist and tasty and the cakes smelled great. I saved one of the loafs in the fridge and had it a week later it was just as good as when it was freshly cooked. If you're thinking of making this cake go for it! It's very tasty and light and despite the mishap I had with the burning I enjoyed it very much.",
