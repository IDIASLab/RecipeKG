I had just cooked a bunch of apples to make applesauce before they spoiled so I subbed the apple for 1c applesauce (unsweetened). I find almost everything too sweet so I completely omitted the raw sugar. Just did 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. It\u2019s almost a perfect amount of sweetness if not slightly on the sweeter side. I could not detect any cayenne in this quantity, but I\u2019m ok with that. Ended up with about 3.5 cups of jam.",
