I have to admit to changing some ingredients to meet family likes, but did really appreciate that the recipe was done in the slow cooker.  We have done the bean pot-oven baked beans for years.  I did not really like them, as I found them too dry.  The beans made your way were so tender & moist, I actually had a small second helping.",

I drained off as much of the water as I could added about 9 ounces of Sweet Baby Ray's hickory & brown sugar barbecue sauce and cooked for another hour. It worked.
