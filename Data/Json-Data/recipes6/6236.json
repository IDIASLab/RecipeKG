I used two cans of fat free cream of chicken soup because that is what I always have on hand and 2% shredded cheddar cheese with red potatoes and the family loved it. The only issue I had was that my prep time and cook time were way longer then you have in the recipe. It was 30 minutes prep and two hours cooking...the cooking time may have something to do with the red potatoes not sure I did cut them very thin. Overall I will totally make this easy and pretty healthy recipe again!!",
