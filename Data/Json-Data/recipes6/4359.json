Great tasting, though, and leftovers just as good or better. I used homemade veg broth, which I do for everything. Very easy to make -- just keep all the ends of veggies that you have in a bag in the freezer (carrot ends, broccoli stalks, onion bits, etc). When you have enough to fill a pot, cover them with water and boil until the veggies have basically nothing left! Drain and keep the \"broth.\" You can compost or throw out the soggy veggies, and then freeze the broth for when you need it. Great way to recycle old bits of veggies, and couldn't be healthier or more natural!",

I used no-cook noodles to counteract the amount of liquid that the other reviewers talked about.  This came out AWESOME!  Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

With the sauce in the bottom of the pan, the lasagna didn't stick.  I substituted a little oregano for the rosemary (I guess you could substitute a little basil too), used whole wheat lasagna noodles and, per one reviewer's recommendation, used a jar of (Classico) portobello mushroom sauce.  Instead of the frozen spinach, I substituted a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach which I just washed, drained, & chopped into slightly smaller pieces.  Although I did chop the artichokes a bit, I'd chop them a little smaller next time.  Just a note - this lasagna isn't high (like you'd think of for a meat lasagna).  If you'd like it higher, you could probably double the recipe, except for maybe the feta that you sprinkle on top.",

I always use regular, dry noodles, and just make sure I've included enough sauce to boil the noodles as the lasagna cooks.

I only used about 1/2 a cup of broth (I like mine a little on the thick side) and crushed about 1/2 a tsp of dried rosemary since I didn't have the fresh.  I added 1/4 a cup of whipping cream to the sauce..to give it a pink look. This is truly a gourmet dish.  You could even omit the broth and noodles all together and use this as a dip with french bread.  I plan on passing this one along...thanks for sharing!!",
