This has to be one of the best pasta salads that I have made, but I do advise to start w/ just one packet of dried Italian dressing mix and go from there (one was all I used and it was perfect for us). I also used one packet to make the dressing that was used in the salad. I grated my parmesan fresh (maybe used a little more than called for, lol), and I think that made a HUGE difference, so definitely do that. I had no fresh mozz. on hand, so I used block and that was fine, but I can't wait to try it w/ the fresh. Hubby commented several times on how much he liked this, so that's saying something. I will def be making this often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I did omit the olives, as we don\u2019t care for them.  I started with 1 \u2013 7oz. pkg. of dry Italian dressing, and it added enough flavor for us, so I did omit the other 2 packages.  This is a salad that improves in flavor the longer it has a chance to meld.  It lasted great for a few days to pack in lunches.  That is big in this house, as we have 3 people who pack almost every day.  This will be a \u201cused often\u201d recipe to have for summer cookouts.",

I did not add the dry italian dressing thought it would make it too salty. It was fabulous!! I also omitted black olives and used Salad Supreme seasoning from McCormick's that gave it a little extra flavor. I meant to add cucumber but forgot to buy at store but that would make a great addition to this salad. Kids loved it!!!",
