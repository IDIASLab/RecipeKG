I saut\u00e9ed an onion and two cloves of (minced) garlic; then added a little over a cup of each sliced carrots and diced celery. I forgot about the roux so it was made in a separate pan (3 tablespoons of butter of flour plus a little olive oil to smooth it out I think a cup of flour would ve been WAY too much. Then a little chicken stock was added to thin it out) while the vegetables cooked. To the pot of veggies I added (4 cups total including what was added to the roux) chicken stock 3/4 Cup White Wine 1 Cup Heavy Cream 1 Cup Skim Milk a (VERY) large chicken breast (cooked with some water and McCormick Garlic Pepper Grinder seasoning then shredded) Fancy Minnesota Wild Rice (I go home to Minnesota for the Holidays each year and stock up on Wild Rice I cooked the rice according to the package plus 2 Tablespoons of butter and maybe 2 teaspoons of the Garlic Pepper Grinder blend). I added the roux to the pot gave it all a stir then added 1 Cup (sliced) Baby Bella Mushrooms plus a large (fresh) Rosemary sprig and 5-6 (fresh) sprigs of Thyme seasoned with fresh ground sea salt and pepper (to taste) this simmered for a half hour or so. When served we sprinkled some (cooked then crumbled) bacon on top. My boyfriend gobbled up two bowls (in the time I ate my one) only taking time to breathe and tell me how good it was I say it was a success!",

But this soup was suffocatingly thick and lacked any depth of flavor. Even after I salted it within an inch of its life and added 1.5 cups extra stock to thin it out. Maybe it was the lack of meat but I think the huge quantity of flour was the real problem. If I ever try it again I'll reduce the flour to 1/4 cup at most and add in some thyme Sherry or Vermouth and a hit of lemon for interest. More French and less Minnesota perhaps but at least edible.",
