I agree with reviewer DSRTBLND43 that the sourness of your starter has a lot to do with the sourness of the bread. My fairly new starter has still not achieved the tang I want, but this recipe is the recipe I will keep using for my sourdough bread. Nice crust, good chewiness, moist inside, and very good flavor. Thank you Kathy!",

This was my first non-box recipe and I just happen to have a 3 year old sourdough colony in my fridge.  The bread was AWESOME!!!  The one comment I have is that I needed to add more water, probably closer to 1/2 a cup.  You can always check on the dough during the first knead cycle and add more if necessary, which is what I did, to make it look like dough.  If it's crumbly it needs water!",
