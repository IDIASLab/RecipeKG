It was my first Instant Pot recipe, and worked well for that, since it was so simple.  We found that it didn't have enough flavor for us, but after I added in more seasonings (mostly a Cajun blend), it was good!  It didn't taste quite like the Brunswick stew that I know, but it was still pretty tasty.  I'll play around with the seasonings more next time, but this recipe has great potential!",
