It was a bit unclear from the recipe what the oats were to look like. However I figured it out and they turned out great! I have tried a number of oatmeal cookie recipies and this one is the best by far. I don't even time them just watch them and about 30 seconds after they have fallen they're done. Chewyish with crispy edges. These are really easy too...I'm a novice at this. I brought them in to my department and they were gone in no time. Try this one!",

I used a different method to toast the oats though...even though that may take something from the recipe...I toasted my oats in a jellyroll pan at 350 for 20 minutes stirring once half way through and then incorporated the butter into the recipe instead of using it to brown the oats. I can't stop eating the dough before they even go into the oven! Delicious!",
