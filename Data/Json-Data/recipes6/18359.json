The only alteration I make is to season the roast with salt & pepper and brown it up really good before putting it it the crockpot. I then sautee the onion in the pork fat before adding them to the crockpot as well....we just don't care for raw onion. We like to serve it over plain white rice with some warm flour tortillas on the side. D-Lish!",

Didn't have the small cans of green salsa so I used a large can of green enchilada sauce, little less pork (cubed), and added some fresh crushed garlic along with the garlic powder and pepper. I was using this a wet sauce for burritos and it was very runny so I thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch. Not as thick as a real sauce but thicker than the soup. Worked just fine on the burritos. This also went great with Linnie's Spanish Rice from AR. Hint don't make the rice with HOT salsa!!",

I removed the roast before adding the verde salsa and pulled it apart with two forks then added it back in and let it swim in the sauce like that for another hour.
