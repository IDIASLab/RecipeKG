It does not say to melt the butter ~ just make sure it is at room temp. And I also suggest that the milk and flour mixture be pretty cool before adding to creamed mixture. Try it again you will love it. PS try using a tsp. of   almond extract when frosting a chocolate cake. Its delicious.",

If I had to stand there with a hand held mixer, I would have given up much sooner.  I mixed & mixed & it still did not all come together.  It looks curdled to begin with, which is normal, but after 20 minutes of mixing, it still looked a little curdled and the sugar had not dissolved.  \r\n\r\nAs far as lumpy flour other people mentioned, you really need to stir constantly as it thickens. I did not have any problem with that at all. Also, this is not nice and cream colored- it is definitely yellow, with the butter and vanilla.  I was hoping it would look lighter upon beating.\r\n\r\nI finally had to give up on this.  I have very little time to find a new recipe now to frost my friend's birthday cake.",

But next time, I don't think I will half the recipe, because it was so good, I want to add a huge mound of icing on each cake.  This was not too sweet and it had a great flavor.  When I bake, I always \"substitute\" healthier ingredients.  So I did use whole wheat pastry flour and sucanat with honey (which I ran through a coffee grinder, that has never had coffee in it, to get a finer sugar - closer to confectioners).  This was great with the healthier substitutions.  Will be making this again today and will try adding a twist with strawberries to get a strawberry icing.  Hope it turns out just as good!\n\n***UPDATE***  I did make this icing by adding strawberries, delish!  I divided the icing into 3 parts, one part stayed the white vanilla (as the recipe), second part I whipped in 1 Tlb. of cocoa for chocolate icing, the third part, I added about 1-2 Tlb. of pureed strawberries (strawberries had sugar on them, left over from shortcake).  Then I iced cupcakes and had 3 different icings.  These were great!  BTW - this recipe \"Simple White Cake\" from this site makes excellent white cupcakes.",

A stand mixer works great for this as it should be beaten for at least 5 minutes to lose the graininess, sometimes closer to 10.\r\n***Update, I read somewhere that it was recommended beating the sugar into the warm paste mixture, I did that and boy does it save tons of time! I beat my butter until fluffy then put in the fridge, then I beat the paste with the sugar and put that in the fridge, when the paste was cool I added it to the butter, added the vanilla then only needed to beat it for about 2 minutes until it was nice and fluffy, no graininess at all.",
