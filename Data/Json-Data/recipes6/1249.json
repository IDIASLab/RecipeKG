Not sure it could have cooked to a crispy point in the oven on top of the beans.  \n\nI, too, was a little worried about the sweetness but the garlic powder helps mitigate it.  Bottom line, I was disappointed when they ran out before I was able to get seconds.  Guess I'll have to make it again ;)",
