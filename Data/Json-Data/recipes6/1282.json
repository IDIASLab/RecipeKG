It looks like a lot of ingredients but I just sliced and diced everything measured all of the dry ingredients into a small bowl and pulled the rest of the ingredients out of the pantry before I started browning the meat. Everything went fast after that. I like spicy and my family does too but not as spicy as me therefore I left out the sliced jalapenos and used Hot Rotel Tomatoes instead. I used a cup of cheese in the mix but probably closer to a 1-1/2 cups on top; served it with sour cream (a must) and tortilla chips. The next day I used the left overs for burritos perfect and didn't need additional cheese. Will make again thanks for sharing.",
