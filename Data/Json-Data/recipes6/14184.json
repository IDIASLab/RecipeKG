There are three from scratch recipes on this site (all are the same).  I read through the countless reviews and I knew I wanted a rich, dark, chocolate cake for these - that being said here's what I did: I used 1/2 c. of Hershey's cocoa, 1 Tbsp. of pure vanilla, and replaced the water with strong brewed coffee and 2 tbsp. of half and half until it equaled 1 cup.  I didn't change a thing with the cream cheese mixture except to add a little vanilla and make sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheese cakes.  I used foil baking cups to bake these and got 18 cupcakes.  Watch carefully - mine were done in 20 minutes not 30 -35.  Cool and store in the fridge as they're best the next day.",

                "reviewBody": "EDIT: I just wanted to add this note. My mom used to make this as a cake (minus the cream cheese filling) in the 60's. Since I first saw this recipe I've been racking my brain to remember what that cake was called. After a brief Google session it finally came back to me - Wacky Cake aka Crazy Cake or Depression Cake. Anyway I baked a batch of these today and they are so adaptable lending themselves to any number of small changes as evidenced by the reviews. A hint to make them a \"SURPRISE\" cupcake: be sure to drop the cheese filling in a small spot in the center of each cake. That way as the cakes bake the filling drops down and is covered up by the rising chocolate cake portion. These are very good and a snap to make. Chocolate and cream cheese are such a great combination! This recipe yielded only 22 cupcakes for me. Maybe I filled my tins a little too full. Watch your baking time on these. I feel that 20 - 25 minutes is a better estimate. I did my first batch at 25 minutes and reduced the next to 20. On a purely personal note I added a little more cocoa (about 1/3 instead of 1/4 cup) being a dark chocolate fan. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture.",

I'm sure the consistency of the cream cheese portion will change to that of cheesecake once they're refrigerated and that will be delicious too. But right now straight out of the oven and cooled the chocolate part is moist with a just right level of chocolatiness and the cream cheese part is creamy and decadent. All three the cake the cream cheese center and the chocolate chips all combine to create this special cupcake. I suppose one could add vanilla to the cream cheese mixture or substitute coffee for the water all good suggestions. But other than using mini-chocolate chips I prepared the recipe as directed and it was just fine as is. Tinker if you feel compelled to but it really isn't necessary. I do question the long baking time directed though - I made my cupcakes bigger yielding 18 rather than 24 and still they were done perfectly at 23 minutes so I can't imagine how baking these for 30-35 minutes could produce a good result. To avoid dry cupcakes and/or filling be careful to bake these just until set.",
