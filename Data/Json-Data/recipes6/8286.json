I will add some shredded chicken fajitas and make it more of a smokey tex-mex flavor soup next time. Mexican spouse LOVED it! This is a good start of a lot of different style recipes.",

So I made exactly as written, but made with 32 oz low-sodium chicken broth,1 tsp no sodium chicken bouillon granules,unsalted diced tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic, and it was goooood! To the average person it's probably a little bland, but for me it was perfect and I got my soup fix I was craving.\n\nUpdate: I have since made this recipe several times. I've added a 4 oz can of diced green chilis and definitely use fresh cilantro if you can. Also added 10 oz extra lean ground turkey cooked with Mrs. Dash taco season and added it to the soup. It's a great way to add a little protein to a nice, light soup. This is definitely one of my favorite very low sodium soups on this site.",
