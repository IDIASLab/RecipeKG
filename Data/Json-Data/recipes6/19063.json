Even with that error, it was a 5 star at our table.  :)  It's like coleslaw, but doesn't taste heavy & saucy like coleslaw sometimes does - it's very light & flavorful.  I hand chopped/sliced everything to avoid the \"shredded coleslaw from a bag\" look & it was well worth it.  It was very pretty w/ the thicker cabbage slices, green bell pepper pieces, thin red onion slices, & matchstick carrot pieces!  I found the amounts called for in the recipe were spot on - the dressing is the right amount for a perfect light coating & after 5 hours in the fridge, it blended nicely without getting that soupy pool at the bottom of the bowl like other coleslaw recipes I've tried.  We really enjoyed it with our Sloppy Joes II sandwiches.  Thank you very much for sharing this!",
