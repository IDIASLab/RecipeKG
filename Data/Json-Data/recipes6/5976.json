I made a few minor tweaks, mostly just based on personal preferences and what I had on hand:\n-I seasoned the pork before I cooked it (in the crock pot) with onion powder, garlic powder, garlic salt and cumin. I would probably do this again.\n-I used diced tomatoes with green chilies, about half a 10-ounce can, instead of just green chilies.\n-I made my own cornbread instead of using a mix. It covered the top generously.\n-I left off the cheese, and didn't miss it.\nWe'll be adding this to our rotation!",
