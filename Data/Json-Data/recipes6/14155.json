Based on the previous suggestions, I made the following changes to the recipe: I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, about 1 Tbls brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, and I used canned peaches rather than pie filling. I actually used one 29oz can AND one 15oz can of peaches and added all of the juice from the 15 oz can. Based on how it turned out, the only change I would make is to add MORE peaches. I had already used 23 additional oz of peaches, but it still seemed like there was more dough than peaches. Next time, I plan on using 2 29oz cans of peaches. One additional note: It makes more than 8 servings. More like 12. Four stars.",

STOP LOOKING! this is divine. Light beautiful crust moist 'melting' filling. My daughter the \"Chocolate Cake is the only cake\" queen has now asked me to make this for her Birthday Cake. I will try the recipe with fresh peaches but I know it won't be a Make or Break situation. This recipe can be enjoyed all year round. Thank You Jan!!",

This couldn't have been more perfect and it was a big pay off for a very little investment, both in time and cost. I added maybe 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter and, since it didn't seem like much for a 9x13\" pan, I baked it in an 8x8\" pan instead and I was glad I did. This is rich, buttery, satisfying, old-fashioned comfort food. I can't believe something so good took so few ingredients and was mixed up and in the oven in less than two minutes. This will be a good recipe to remember if I need a dessert in a hurry! If you have any flavor of pie filling on hand, and basic staples in your pantry, you're just a blink away from a great dessert!",

The dough never rose and was a gummy mess. When I looked at the bottom of my can of baking powder, I saw that the expiration date was June 1996 -- 11 years ago!! Moral of this story: Make sure your baking powder is fresh. Or, better yet, use self-rising flour and omit the baking powder! But this is one of the easiest and best desserts around!",

I used 4 cups of fresh sliced peaches and let it sit a bit but it still wasn't as juicy as I had hoped it would be.
