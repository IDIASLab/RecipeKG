With that said, though I must say that no way do you need to saute the ramen noodles, sesame seeds and nuts in 1/4 cup margarine on the stove top.  That makes it waaay too fattening!  You'll get the same results if you put those ingredients on a cookie sheet and under the broiler for just a couple minutes until toasted.  And from what I have heard from other cooks, you should never saute in margarine anyway, but only butter.",
