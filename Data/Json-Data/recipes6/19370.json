We had to use so much syrup to enjoy them that I'm pretty sure it cancelled out the healthy benefits of the pancakes!  Since we enjoyed the taste, I think I'll try making them again (with a couple of changes to attempt getting a more moist result.)  If that doesn't work out, I'll probably try another recipe the next time.     **Update: I tried these again replacing the 1/4 c. oil with 1/2 c. applesauce, used 2 eggs and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla, and liked them MUCH better - moist and yummy!",

I made the recipe exactly as posted, except for having to make a substitution for buttermilk (lemon juice in milk), and it was fabulous!  The pancakes were moist, hearty, and tasty!  I served them with butter pecan syrup (you can buy an extract from Watkins or a similar company), and the whole family just loved it.  My husband also likes to top his with sliced bananas, which is a yummy option.  Just a note:  some reviewers seemed to have trouble with the amount of liquid in the recipe.  I'm in Utah, where the climate's pretty dry, and my batter turned out thick.  We're also at a higher altitude, but I don't know if that makes any difference in this particular instance.  Because these recipes are submitted from all over the country, where climates and altitudes vary greatly, the recipes on this site may not turn out exactly as you expect.  Adjustments may need to be made.  Enjoy this recipe!!",

This recipe is also open to some wonderful flavour boosters such as cinnimon,vanilla extract and two tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate which compliments the whole wheat. The addition of about 1/2 cup of bran and wheat germ ensures an excellent and healthy breakfast!!  A good idea though, is to use two rather than one egg which ensures a less dry pancake.",

They came out so fluffy and moist! The batter was almost like muffin batter (we like our pancakes thick!). finally we dropped frozen blueberries onto the pancakes once we laddled them in the pan (got this tip from a friend and it makes for much better pancakes then if you just mix the blueberries in the batter.",
