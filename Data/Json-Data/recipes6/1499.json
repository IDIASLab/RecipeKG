I used a GF flour mix with white rice tapioca and sweet rice instead of brown rice and sweet rice. I used teff grains instead of teff flour. I omitted the nuts. I also accidentally used 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1 Tbsp. My batter was soupy and the waffles rubbery. I added 1 C more GF flour and that helped the texture. In the future I'd reduce the amount of milk. It for sure needs salt at least 1/2 tsp I think.",

Maybe the Teff flour would help them hold together better?",
