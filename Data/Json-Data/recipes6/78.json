Made this for dinner last night and there was happy silence from my husband's corner as he finished his portion and then not-so-silent (but relatively subdued lest he resemble Bambi in the headlights before running away) ecstatic chatter from mine, when he got up for seconds.  Normally, when I make sloppy joes, there is the animated discussion about how ketchup should be used only as a condiment on the side to adorn hot dogs, hamburgers, the occasional french fry, but it should never -- and he repeats never -- be used as an ingredient.  There was none of that with this meal :) -- not even the suspicious, \"Did you put ketchup in this?\" or the disappointed, \"Honey, you Know I'm not a big sweet-and-sour fan\".  A note to those reviewers who thought this was too \"sloppy\", I would say make this again and be more patient next time -- the liquid does evaporate eventually.  The flavour is superb that it is well worth the wait.   So .. Thanks again!  I have myself a new sloppy joe recipe!",

This was so easy and so good - perfect for Sunday football. I doubled the recipe using 96/4 ground beef, one red pepper and one green pepper, half ketchup and half Bennetts Original Chili Sauce along with a generous splash of white wine vinegar, and brown sugar to taste along with the rest of the ingredients.  I highly recommend watching Chef John's video. It's only a few minutes long and was very helpful. You really do need to add the water and let it simmer down for at least 30 minutes - and don't be afraid to add the cayenne it really does make a difference but doesn't make it \"hot\". All I did was keep it warm in a crock pot during the game. I served these on slider rolls with chips and pickles to rave reveiws. Thanks Chef John for another awesome recipe!",
