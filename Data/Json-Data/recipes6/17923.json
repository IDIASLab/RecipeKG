Make sure to beat the sugar/butter (or margarine) for a long time to incorporate air - it makes the cake come out light and fluffy (do not beat to much after adding flour though). Added only 1 Tb more milk. My husband said he \"couldn't stop eating it.\" It is plenty sweet - sweetness just right. Baked it in a sprayed 8\" sq glass pan - still gooey at 30 mins so I baked it 10 mins more (40 mins total). Will make this again!",
