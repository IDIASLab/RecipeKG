I took a risk of subbing for similar things and it was AMAZING!\n-Didn't have 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom, so I used 1 can CoM, and 1 can Cream of Chicken.\n-Didn't have can biscuits, so I subbed in crecent rolls (gently pieced and rolled into dumplings)\n-Didn't have veg broth, used chicken stock. \n-I like color, so I added veggies. I also like being lazy, so it was a half bag of frozen mixed. ;)\n-Did this recipe call for poultry seasoning? totally forgot poultry seasoning.. lol \n\nI don't feel I changed much of anything drastically, but this is a recipe one can definitly piece together with whatever you've got!\n\nSO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD!",
