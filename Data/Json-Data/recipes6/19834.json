I also made sure to mash the strawberries.  These were SO INCREDIBLY AMAZING.  The texture was perfect, lighter than I expected and they were amazingly moist.  The kept their moisture extremely well and if they hadn't been such a hit with the finace and rommates I'm sure they would've stayed that way regardless of where I kept them for at least a week.  Throwing texture aside the taste of these was enough to make me a fan for life.  (Although for those avoiding sugar I could see reducing the sugar just a tad-they'd still be fantastical) Delicious, filling, healthy, and quick to make!...what more could you ask for?",

The only thing I did different was add blueberries instead of strawberries and I used 2 large bananas instead of 3. I did read the other reviews and I dont understand why there was any negative ones--but a tip for future bakers would be to make sure they FOLD the bananas around the dry ingredients. Dont stir the batter but if you do definitely dont stir too much--that makes the muffins hard sometimes. Good luck and I hope everyone else enjoyes these muffins as much as I did!!",
