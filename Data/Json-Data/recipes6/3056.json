I use tapioca flour instead of arrowroot coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and end up adding a touch of water to get the dough to come together better. I roll out the dough between parchment paper instead of flour. The flavor and texture are great. You can bake them on the short end for chewy cookies or a bit longer for crunchy ones; both are delicious. The recipe doubles (triples quadruples...) nicely. Glad I came across this one!!",
