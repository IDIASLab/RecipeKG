My mom is an awesome cook -- most everything is made from scratch -- and both my mom and dad said this was the BEST SOUP they've EVER had (they are in the 60s-70s).  I think my dad ate four huge bowls and he asked for some to take home!!!!  That is the highest compliment!!  I make a few minor revisions -- I double the onion, butter, carrots, black pepper and bay leaf and add minced garlic.  I also make the Boiled Chicken recipe from this site (using 4 lb. raw chicken) and use all of that chicken PLUS part of that broth instead of all water (probably 2-3 cups of the broth and 9-10 cups water).  I also cook it alot longer -- a couple of hours -- before adding the noodles.  I also use frozen noodles (Reames brand).  These noodles are thick and hearty and really make for a delicious, homemade taste and presentation. Thanks Sherry for an awesome recipe!!!  Now, I'm off to have a bowl for lunch.  I'm glad I didn't give all of the leftovers to my dad to take home!!! ha  ha",

They're terrible tasting, not healthy (way too much salt, no nutritional value) & make awful broth.  Instead use Swanson's chix broth instead, this is the closest to homemade & it's true. It's worth the extra cost to use \"Swanson's\", as their broth is nutritional, plus non fat. Per other reviewer, OK to cook the chix w/the broth.  Can substitute noodles w/pastina, alphabet pasta, orzo pasta.",

Added a small bag of frozen white corn. also, i used a whole store bought rotisserie chicken instead of just chopping up cooked chicken meat. I placed the whole chicken in to the pot when adding the veggies, spices,and broth and simmered it all for 30 minutes like the recipe says to do. Then removed the whole chicken from the pot and removed the meat from the bird then placed the meat back in to the pot of soup. I've had so many complements on this recipe it is unbelievable. Everyone says it's the BEST chicken soup they have ever had. Thanks so much for this wonderful easy recipe!",
