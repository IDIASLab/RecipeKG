I doubled that part of the recipe to make sure the bottom was well covered as well as the top. I'm pleased I made that decision it was tasty and the appearance was well put together. As a matter of fact I doubled the entire recipe. I ended up using two cans of cranberry sauce; one jellied and one jellied with whole berries. I apologize for reviewing the recipe in spite of my alterations but I figured it was alright seeing how I used the same ingredients just more of them lol. I did however make an orange/pecan glaze when it was all said and done and it was a great compliment to the cake. (My orange glaze: confec sugar orange zest & juice & pecan pieces)",

I'm wondering if making half again as much of the dough, and making the bottom crust a little thicker, might not be a good idea.",

I used around 6 tablespoons of butter (about 1/2 the amount the recipe calls for) and after cutting that in, I used around 1/2 C of apple sauce and cut that in also.  Doing it this way didn't require an egg as the applesauce added enough moisture.  I pre-baked the bottom layer for 10 minutes before adding the cranberry sauce I made.  I baked for 30 minutes after adding the sauce and top layer.  In a nutshell...delicious!!!  BTW, the filling can really be just about anything from jam to preserves to a thick fruity sauce.",

Do yourself a big favor and put some printed copies in your purse! I have to laugh at myself because although I bake using whole wheat flour most of the time...you know...trying to keep the family healthy I use butter instead of margarine for the squares and let me tell you my two son's coming running to the kitchen when they smell the butter! However I did use 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and it turns out great. I love this recipe because our family does not have a \"sweet tooth\" and it is just right. Ok maybe it's the gardener in me but I'm used to getting my fingers into the earth and I found right off the bat that to make crumbs for this recipe I was just going to dive in and work the butter and the dry ingredients with all ten fingers. Tada!! Also a little hint to make the cranberry sauce spreadable. While still in the can take a fork and squish it scooping the softened sauce on the crust. When I'm grocery shopping now I make it a point to stop by the canned cranberries to see if they are on sale! I'm sure this recipe will be a favorite for a long time. Thanks! Margie Bayer",
