My kids love their shape and I love that they aren't too sweet. I used to run out of filling before I ran out of dough but have learned that a very thin layer of filling goes a long way. Also I refrigerate them overnight so that they are very easy to slice the next day. Thanks!",

I chilled it for at least two hours. I cut out a piece of wax paper into a 10x14\" rectangle and used that as a guide to roll out each portion of dough. Place your dough in the middle and when you reach the edges of the rectangle, you're good. I divided the filling into three equal portions ahead of time so I wouldn't run out. Spread the filling with a small offset spatula right to the edges of the rectangle. Use the wax paper to help roll it into a tight roll from the long edge.  Wrap the rolls in wax paper. Repeat with remaining dough portions and freeze the rolls overnight. Slice with a sharp knife into 1/4\" slices and bake on parchment paper lined trays. 15 minutes was WAY too long to bake. They were dark brown and very crispy. I found 10 min to be the perfect amount of time. The recipe yielded about 10 dozen cookies. I posted a photo if you want to see what they looked like. \n\nFor the filling I ground the nuts and dates in the food processor(separately) before adding them to the water & sugar. Made it very easy to spread on the cold dough. Good luck! I almost forgot... they were delicious! ??",
