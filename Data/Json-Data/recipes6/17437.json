Also I substituted tomato puree for the tomato juice to thicken the soup and give it a little heartier flavor. I'd also suggest adding more salt and pepper to taste. This should be served with a dollop of sour cream plain yogurt or kefir. If you want to reduce the fat content let the borscht cool and skim the fat off the top - the beef shanks do add a good amount of grease.",

I was trying to find a recipe that is similar to my Grandma's Polish Borsch and this one sounded close. \n\nIm giving this 4 stars because, like other reviewers said, it needs that fresh dill to give it the right taste. I added about 3 tablespoons. \n\nI also used much more cabbage and beets than was supposed to. an entire small head of cabbage and 6 large beets. \n\nI also think this recipe would be better if using short ribs instead of beef schank, but everyone in my family enjoyed this. Tumbs up - im not an experienced cook yet and it was not too difficult to make.",

It's rich yet it is really low in fat (I refrigerated the broth overnight and skimmed off the fat) and high in fiber. The color is gorgeous. It fits in perfectly with the way I eat. I used my Cuisinart to shred the veggies so it was really a snap. This is now one of my favorites.",

A hefty amount of tomato paste and diced tomatoes rather than the tomato juice might help. The main thing that saved this from being 3 stars in my book is the beef which I find to be essential. The vegetarian borscht recipes I've tried taste like dirt. It will be a while before I experiment with this recipe again since it is fairly time consuming (even with a food processor). The ingredients also aren't items I typcally keep stocked in the house which makes it a little more costly than some other meals I enjoy.",
