Both spellings appear to be acceptable and virtually all recipes call for the cinnamon and cheese combination. It simply isn't capirotada without the cheese. Think apple pie with a slice of sharp cheddar on top -- wonderfully complimentary flavors! The ingredients used have strong religious symbolism this being primarily a lenten dish. I made this recipe exactly as presented and found it to be quite pleasing as did the others in my family. Next time I will probably try using brown sugar instead of the less-historic refined white sugar. I might try using sliced almonds or walnuts. And I would try buttering the bread and oven toasting it rather than frying. But I really enjoyed this exactly as is.",
