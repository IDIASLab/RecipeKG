This recipe comes very close (it's perhaps a little sweeter). Cornmeal cookies are a refreshing change from the usual choc chip or oatmeal and the lime makes this particular recipe very special. These cookies are great for teatime to accompany a light meal or to go with all the lime/chili flavors of many Mexican meals. I'm going to experiment with decreasing the sugar a bit but otherwise these are fantastic.",
