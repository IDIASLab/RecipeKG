Additionally, I baked it for about 38 minutes and sprinkled powdered sugar on top just before serving.  We served with syrup and butter, but honestly didn't need it.  This tastes wonderful and only takes about 5-10 minutes to throw together.",

We did up the egg/milk mixture as other reviews suggested and sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving and found it sweet enough to not need to add syrup. DELICIOUS!!! Increasing the oven temp to 375 helped with the final texture go from a bit mushy to nicely toasted. We may even add some banana slices between the brown sugar and bread layers next time for a twist.",

It was great. I did however have to substitute heavy whipping cream for the milk because I was running low on milk. On a different day I also tried this recipe with diced pecans on the layer with the brown sugar. It did not come out right may try again with pecans on the top. I have also made this with vanilla added because I like that flavor in my french toast. My additions of heavy whipping cream instead of milk and vanilla brought the flavor over the top.\nI have never made french toast on the stove again after finding this recipe.",
