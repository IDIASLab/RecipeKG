I read all the reviews beforehand and it seemed the only complaint some had was that the fish itself was bland.  What I did was marinade the steaks in 8 oz. of Italian Dressing for a few hours.  That really made a difference, it kept the fish moist and flavorful and complimented the toppings nicely!  Also if you are able, try to use every ingredient in its freshest form - it really helps the taste!  I used garlic and herb feta instead of plain and that was great.  The last thing I did based on some reviews was loosely cover the dish with foil for the first 8 min., then I uncovered and baked another 8 min.  I could really tell how the foil helps the feta not brown too quickly and keeps the tomatoes from turning mushy.  Besides its spectacular taste, this dish is a beautiful presentation, perfect for company!  I will use again and again!\r\nP.S. If you can't get fresh halibut, Trader Joe's sells it for $9.99 lb.  Its flash frozen, so it's the next best thing to fresh - you really can't taste the difference!",

He said this is the best he's ever had and that's saying a lot considering his brother-in-law is an Alaskan halibut fisherman and his sister cooks some amazing dishes with halibut.  I did marinate in Italian dressing for an hour, used the diced tomatoes with basil and oregano as previously suggested.  Used fillet instead of steaks, so it took a little longer to bake.  While the fish was baking I sauteed mushrooms and garlic in olive oil and added those to the dish before presenting to the table.  Yummm, will make again and again!  I can't wait to make this for my sister-in-law!!  :) Thank you for this wonderful dish!",

This is a simple light and fresh tasting dish that can be eaten totally guilt free! Hubs can't tolerate feta cheese so unfortunately I had to leave that out but I'm sure that would have been a delicious addition. I baked this as directed uncovered for 15 minutes and it was perfectly done. Beautiful on the plate and a very satisfying meal that doesn't sit in your stomach like a brick.",

The colors are gorgeous (white feta red tomatoes green basil) and it looks delicious right out of the oven with the feta slightly browned... mmm! We take a nice big piece of fish and throw everything on there (i.e. a whole zucchini etc) and it's like having a big salad on top of your piece of fish. We don't serve it with any sides because the topping is enough. Just a glass of white wine and you're set! One recommendation -- In order for the fish not to dry out it's best to use an evenly thick piece of fish. We've made this recipe about 8 times and it always turns out juiciest when the piece has an even thickness. Great recipe for beginner cooks! Really impressive!: )",
