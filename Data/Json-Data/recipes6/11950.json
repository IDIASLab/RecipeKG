She thinks this means $2.50, but then she gets her credit card bill back and finds out it is $250.00. Outraged, she spreads the recipe far and wide to try and get her money's worth. I first heard this story 6 years ago and was given a recipe on a sheet of paper which bore the date '1986.' The supposed originator of the recipe was a well-known cookie company. I have since heard this tale again several times, with the recipe originating from different upscale department stores. True story? Who knows, but it's a darn good cookie. Here's my version.",

                "reviewBody": "Tip #1: Finely ground oatmeal for a subtle nutty taste and texture. Don't grind if you prefer a rougher, more dense cookie that tastes more like an oatmeal cookie with chips. Tip #2: Using unsalted butter will make cookies spread more while using a margarine will make them spread less and be thicker. Tip #3: Add 1/2 tsp more of baking soda for a higher rising cookie. Tip #4: These cookies are extra extra sweet so you may want to reduce sugars to 3/4 cup each to lessen sugary taste. Tip #5: I found 1.5 cups of choc. chips more than enough for me. But, true chocoholics should try 2 cups of the chocolate chunks instead. Tip #5: Watch cookies very carefully. Cooking times may range from 7-10 minutes depending upon the cookie size you choose, your texture preference, and your oven's temperature settings. They may look undercooked, but you'll get a crunchy edge and soft chewy inside if you bake just until the outer edge only is brown.  Let them set 1 minute on the cookie sheet after removing them from the oven to finish cooking them and you'll get a perfectly chewy but not soogy cookie. Over-cooking (entire cookie is brown) will definitely result in a hard crispy cookie, unless you like them that way.  Tip #6: This is a lot of dough so you can either halve the recipe or store the dough in your frig. in a platic zipper bag so you can make a fresh batch when the mood strikes you.",

Here are the slight changes I made which resulted in a perfect, thick chocolate chip cookie...I used margarine (1 stick lite, 1 stick regular). Margarine helps cookies stay plump rather than flat.  I let my eggs reach room temperature, and was careful not to overblend them with the dough (another common problem with cookie bakers).  Lastly, I added 1/2 tsp more of baking soda and 1/4 tsp more of baking powder to help the cookies stay thick.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a T using Ghirdelli (sp?) chocolate chips.  I noticed some people said the dough got stuck in their mixers, but if you look at the recipe closely, you will notice it says to STIR the batter once you mix in the dry stuff...do not use your mixer at this point. Good luck! This is quite a perfect cookie!:-)",

They stay dense and moist, not fluffy and cake-y like other recipes I've tried, and it's all chunk with a just a little cookie holding it all together!! The last time I made them, I used 1/2 cup each of walnuts, pecans and macadamia nuts, and substituted almost 1/2 of the semi-sweet chips with a Hershey Bake Shoppe product called Almond Toffee Bits - basically the inside of a Heath bar, but in perfectly uniform little chunks and with no mess and frustration of chunking up the candy yourself. Really great!  Oh, and if you really want to go overboard, make an ice cream sandwich with a couple of these bad boys!",

                "reviewBody": "These are IT!! Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies. If you don't like your cookie too sweet, reduce the amount of brown sugar and white sugar to 3/4 cup. Please don't omit the grated chocolated as well as the ground oats. It makes a world of a difference in taste and texture. For those reviewers who left out the grated chocolate, try it again and you'll taste a difference. I've also found that I get a better looking cookie when I mix the batter by hand rather than with an electric mixer. The trick is to let the butter soften at room temperature or pop it in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds. Make sure not to let it melt though! It alters the appearance and texture of your cookie. \r\n\r\nThese cookies do take quite some time to prepare so be sure to make a huge batch and freeze the rest of them. Everyone who tastes these delectable treats raves about them and will beg you to make them. I love to bake and do it quite often. These are the most requested treats by my family and friends.",

OOOOHHHHH my it was so good the next day I had to make another batch using the same candy bars and even mixed in some reeses p-butter cups and a whatchamacallit bar. Even better.
