If you love coconut you will love these cookies. I used a greased cookie sheet instead of buying parchment paper and it worked fine but they did stick just a little. Also when I made the full recipe I came out with 2 dozen cookies (which fit nicely on two cookie sheets) instead of 3 dozen as suggested and they were great! The cookies would be pretty small if you made 3 dozen and maybe not as chewy (the best part!) You must try this recipe because it is so tasty and easy!",
