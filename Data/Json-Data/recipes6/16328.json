I took the advice from some other reviews and used 4 eggs and 4 cups of milk.  I also added plumped raisins and about 2 T cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the mixture that is poured over the bread. This seemed to coat the bread very nicely.  I cooked it in the oven without foil for the first 20 minutes until lightly brown and then covered with foil for 30 minutes.  The last 10 minutes, I removed the foil and by doing this, the top of the bread did not burn, just got a nice golden color.  \n\nFor the sauce, I used a combination of Bailey's and Jamison's.  Delicious!! My only concern was that I seemed to have quite a bit of liquid to cover the top, so I poured about half of the sauce on top of the bread pudding and then placed back in the warm oven to soak up some of the juices.  Once I took it out of the oven (about 10 minutes later), I poured the remaining sauce over the top and let it set.  Seemed to work out really good.  I'll definitely make this again!",

I didn't have any whiskey in the house so used one of those \"airplane bottles\" of Bailey's Irish Cream instead and it was superb. Very smooth and subtle. The sauce would be fine with a bit of vanilla instead of the alcohol too I think. Try it and enjoy! It's certainly going to be an oft-served item in our home.",
