I altered the recipe to make it healthier-low cholesterol & low fat. I use 8 egg whites since I am allergic to egg yolks. I substitute apple sauce for the oil use wheat flour instead of white flour and use honey instead of white sugar. I add 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ginger & 1/4 teaspoon cloves. After it is in the pan I sprinkle generously with pumpkin pie spice on the top. I leave off the cream cheese icing because it is sweet enough without it. This makes a great fall breakfast dish.",
