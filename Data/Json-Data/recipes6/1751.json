The flavor combination of brown sugar and just a little butter makes it hard to forget this unique treat is in the freezer. The subdued amounts of spice complement the delicate flavor of acorn squash. I modified this recipe from an existing pumpkin ice cream recipe in one of my cookbooks.",

Very gentle flavour with a very smooth and luxurious feel to the final product. I made it as in the original recipe but did add a dusting of cinnamon not only for looks but it did complement the final taste. None of your guests will guess the main ingredient so interesting to serve to guests. For me this one should be paired with some crisp spicy cookies or a slice of apple pie...",
