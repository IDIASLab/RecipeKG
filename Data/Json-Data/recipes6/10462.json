Warm right out of the oven I think I like them even better than the old fashioned banana bread recipe I used to make. They are lighter in texture and have a more noticiable banana flavor. I did make a few changes... I went heavy on the vanilla added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice (because I love it) and a splash of rum flavoring - all of which were holdovers from my original banana bread recipe. I also made muffins instead of a loaf (because that allows for better portion control in my family) so I adjusted the bake time down to about 15-20 min. Overall easy tasty and fantastic!:-D Thanks for sharing!",

My family and I have never really cared for banana bread so when I found myself with 6 overly ripe bananas I didn't know what to do with them. So I thought I would make bread and take it to work. I substituted the walnuts with chocolate chips and withing 20 min. out of the oven the bread was half gone! My husband his friend and our son devoured over half the bread in one sitting! Now..they are hoping the bananas will get too ripe to eat so I can make the bread again! Many thanks!",
