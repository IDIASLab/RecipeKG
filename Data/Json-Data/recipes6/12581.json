Even at that these were plenty salty and I can't imagine for flavor OR health reasons using a full 1-1/2 tsp. of salt. That said while great tasting and buttery (if you use all butter as I did and NO margarine) this was not the type of chocolate chip cookie I like but I know it appeals to others. It's just a matter of personal preference that I don't care for a soft moist chocolate chip cookie as this is. (The higher proportion of brown sugar is partly responsible for that) If you like the Original Nestle Toll House Cookie recipe this is a step above that both in appearance as well as flavor.",
