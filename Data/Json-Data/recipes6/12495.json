I used a 1 tablespoon scoop, and scooped the dough so that it would be quicker.  The cookies were baked approximately 12 minutes, then I let them sit for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing.  They tasted like slightly richer shortbread cookies, with a hint of sweetness.  I substituted raising for currants and omitted the carraway as they were for DH's office potluck and I thought many would prefer without.  His coworkers ate them all up...and sadly I only had one cookie myself to test them after they came out of the oven.  Everyone loved them.",
