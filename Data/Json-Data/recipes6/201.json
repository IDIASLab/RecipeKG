The flavors of this are really good...nothing overpowering, just right, IMO. I will def be using this simple, delicious recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

We used only about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of orange zest which I think was the perfect amount - anything more than that and I think it would be a little too orangy for me. I will definitely make this again and would highly recommend it to everyone!",

Added a bit of diced fresh ginger root and even though the chili paste (with garlic) is a pantry stable in my house my wife isn't a fan of the heat as I am so I just added a bit to give some zest and had the bottle at table for me to add more. Also added some red and green pepper strips for both flavor and color. BTW when you fry the beef it is essential to use high heat and not stir it around so the Maillard reaction to take place. Really enhances the flavor.",
