I do agree that it was bland even with local dry cider (much different from what you get in the US). Less cream might solve the problem but to the sauce just didn't have a lot of taste even with three different types of fairly tart apples (Cox Braeburn & Delicious) and the dincredibly strong onions they have here. The pork however was extremely tender and my kids like it (passed on the sauce completely after the first taste). Probably won't make it again.",
