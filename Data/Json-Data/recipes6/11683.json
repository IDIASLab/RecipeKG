It's not a problem that potica takes some time to make--lots of breads take time and this one does too. The challenge of this bread is rolling the dough out thin yet not so thin that the filling seeps out. I did two loaves: one about 18 inches long and one about 14 inches long. The filling seeped out of the longer one (too thin layers) and the top layer of the fatter loaf split (otherwise it was fine). So I'm going to keep practicing because even though my loaves aren't as pretty as Olga's or Christine's they tasted really good. Thanks Christine!",
