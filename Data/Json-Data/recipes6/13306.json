I too feel that the topping could use some improvment. For the topping, I have added oatmeal and it does make it more like a \"crisp.\" Also, the addition of a little flour (enhanced with pumpkin pie spice) stretches the mix to ensure that there is enough to cover the top. A must try for those who want a little something different for the holidays!",

Nice substitute for regular pumpkin pie and is a nice accompaniment to my requisite apple pie. The yellow cake is so much more interesting than standard pie crust and marries well with the pumpkin filling. However the topping mixture didn't work out all the well as it was not turning into coarse crumbs during preparation. Too much butter? Not enough cake mix? I ended up adding more flour (about 1/2 cup) and 2 tbsps of sugar (might try brown sugar next time), and a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to cut the flour taste to the topping mixture in order to get the consistency right. This gave me more than enough topping and I may even back off a bit on the amount of topping I add to the dish next time. But it was a hit and I'll definitely make it again. 4 stars for flavor and \"interesting\" factor, a star off for recipe adjustment.",
