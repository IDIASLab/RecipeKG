Batter was very thin liquid and I just poured a thin layer onto warmed buttered skillet and flipped once brown.   First two were perfect, the third I poured too thin and tore apart when I flipped.  The rest were great.   So easy will make again.",

I did not use honey as I am not eating sugar. After the batter sits a bit it does thicken up but not enough to roll out. I poured it into a pan sprayed with Pam and spread it with a spoon to the size of a tortilla. The end result was still thicker than a flour tortilla but the taste was good and the texture was similar to a thick tortilla. When you're limiting carbs this works well! This made 3 nice size tortillas.",
