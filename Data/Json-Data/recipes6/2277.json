It did not take a full hour for mine to cook but it could have been the size of my squash. Mine was completely soft at about 35-40 minutes. I also didn't use the full amount or salt or butter but again it probably was because of the size of my squash. I think you will just need to see how much flesh you get from the squash and decide on the quantity of the butter and salt you need to add so it isn't too salty or greasy. Thanks for the recipe!",
