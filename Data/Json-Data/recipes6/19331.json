Made exactly as written & served with Triscuit Garden Herb crackers (you need a sturdy cracker). 8oz blocks of cream cheese and cheddar cheese, alternating standing squares, filled the bottom of a bread loaf pan perfectly! The marinade was fantastic! My family raved about it! The only suggestion from several was to not use the squares, but to cut the cheese (sorry for the pun) into halves again for smaller rectangles and just layer the bottom of the pan with them, which can be spooned onto a cracker a littler easier! The squares were slightly awkward to maneuver onto a cracker along with some of the marinade. Overall though, they LOVED it! Thanks!",
