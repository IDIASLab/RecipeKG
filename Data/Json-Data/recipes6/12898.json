No mention was made of stirring during cooking. This is not only a good idea, it is down right critical. Plus, no mention is made of the initial cooking temperature. Keep it down a bit, stir constantly, and you should have good results. The flavor is just like Bordens. I mixed it with the can of Bordens I had on hand and it worked great.",

I don't have a double broiler, so I filled a larger sauce pan 1/3 full of water; and took a slightly smaller saucepan and put it inside the larger one.  In the smaller pan I sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray and put the ingredients in.  I cooked in on medium heat - stirring often - for about 10-15 minutes.  I didn't have ANY problems with this recipe whatsoever.  It was an identical substitute.  Thanks so much for sharing!",

I made a second batch in the microwave oven and timed and watched it very carefully so it wouldn't boil over. I zapped for 1 min., stirred zapped for 30 seconds, twice, stirred, then continued to zap until it boiled almost to the rim for 15 seconds. I did this for 5 times, stirring after each. Finally, I put it into my Bullet and blended it for about 50 seconds till it was totally smooth and exactly like the canned version. I'll make it this way from now on - it tastes like what I always bought before but is much cheaper to make. It actually takes less time to make it this way, too!",
