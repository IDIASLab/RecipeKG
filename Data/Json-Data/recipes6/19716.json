To eliminate any bitterness I used thin skinned oranges and after cooking, topped and tailed them to remove the thicker parts of the skin. Also I measured 1 1/4cups of the pulp as there was too much and would have been bitter. It browned up in minutes so I quickly popped on some foil but didn't think to spray the foil with cooking oil so it stuck and tore the top off a perfectly cooked cake, DUH!!! The cake was as good as promised and our guests loved it, my girls, 14 and 11 thought it was \"disgusting\" as the texture if you're not used to it is wet and very different to flour based cakes. I won't make it again but if you like flourless, this would be a winner!",
