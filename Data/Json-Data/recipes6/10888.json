I never used the nuts only because the kids didn't like them, and occasionally make this in a Bundt pan. The aroma as it's baking is wonderful, like a good comfort food should be.  It is deliciously moist with a ribbon of cinnamon and not too sweet, especially since there is only a powdered sugar glaze and not a heavy frosting. Even now when my kids come, I still make this cake---just for the memories.",

I was worried halfway through baking that it would cook too quickly on the outside, and be runny on the inside. I lowered the oven temp to 350, and baked it an extra 10 min. I also used 1/2 c. of sour cream and more cinnamon. But I know it still would have been perfect had I followed the recipe exactly. I left off the icing and it was so moist and GOOD! I also swirled the batter with a butter knife after I layered the streusle filling in the middle. I read the reviews about too much cinnamon right in the middle. I liked that change the best. It gave it an eveness. Excellent, thank you, will make it again ASAP!",

Added more batter and then another layer of streusel. I baked it for about 20-25 minutes and then when cool drizzled it with powdered sugar icing. Excellent 'coffeecake' muffin! Moist and cinnamony.

It tastes so good inside the cake (not overpowering at all like I thought) that I wanted it in every bite and not just the center. But my family loved it! Even the cake master herself (my grandmother) commented that the cake was delicious! I think I \"socked-it-to-them\" with this one! Happy baking everyone!",
