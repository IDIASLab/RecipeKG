The only thing that was wrong is that the instructions did not tell when to add the peanut butter not that it was hard to figure out but I did all the wet ingredients and I was like what about the peanut butter??!!

Definitely need a mini muffin baking pan for this one. With a regular sized muffin baking pan the cookies are too big for the miniature peanut butter cups. Of course you could always buy the regular size peanut butter cups instead! This recipe makes about 24 cookies in the mini muffin pans. I fill each muffin space to the top. They are slightly dry so next time I might use a little less flour.",

I used a mini muffin scoop to measure out the dough and cooked it in mini muffin tins. I pressed one frozen mini P.B. cup down into the top of each one before cooking and that left an imprint that was easy to fill with the candy cups once they came out of the oven. The bake time for my oven was closer to 10 mins and they required quite a bit of cooling in the fridge before they would come out without breaking. Make these- you won't be disappointed!",
