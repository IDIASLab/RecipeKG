For those that have problems with this one: pretend you are making a thick cobbler pie/with no fruit.  Between each layer of dough-add a splash of the milk sauce.  Cover the entire top with dough, and keep this \"top\" moist while cooking by spreading milk sauce over it every few minutes.  Hope this helps out!",

First if you use carnation milk it will be a thicker sauce and make enough to pour over once you start serving.  Now with the roll, you need to make the dough, roll it out and layer it with sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon and pieces of unsalted butter over the entire roll.  You should be able to make 2 rolls with this recipe.  Once you layer it then roll it up.  Cut it in small rolls from this and put it in a baking sheet.  Bake the rolls for 30 min by them self  until its golden brown, then 15 more min with half of the cream sauce poured over it.  This will prevent it from being mushy and you will be able to have a light flaky crust with a semi moist center.  AGAIN save additional sauce for later.",
