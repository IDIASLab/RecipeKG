I didn't have chili oil so I used sesame.  I peeled and sliced the eggplant and brushed both sides with additional sesame oil.  I broiled them on both sides along with sliced slabs of red Bermuda onion rings also brushed with the sesame oil.  Meanwhile, I combined the sauce ingredients (I doubled the sauce)and microwaved for 2 minutes until thickened, stirring every 30 seconds.  When the eggplant was browned, I basted it and served it topped with toasted sesame seeds.  It was delicious.",

I made 4 times the recipe added 2 Tbs. of Cooking Sherry 1 clove of garlic and omitted the salt. Also I added a little chopped ginger crushed red pepper flakes (instead of chilli oil) and a half of a red green peppper. This tastes just as good as our best local chinese restaurant and living so close to New York I think I know good Chinese food. Thanks Bonnie now my family thinks I can really cook!",
