I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to the apples when mixed in with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Also like the reviewers suggested I used less brown sugar both when mixed in with the apples and cinnamon (and cornstarch) and less brown sugar with the flour and walnuts mixture. Finally we used Matsu apples--from a local orchard--and they were just perfect!",
