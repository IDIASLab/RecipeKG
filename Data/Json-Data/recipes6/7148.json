I was timing dinner to be ready at a certain time so I actually simmered mine on medium-low for 35 minutes or so. They still turned out great. I served over jasmine rice with the juices since mine did not reduce all the way. I also had an Asian veggie medley on the side. My 4 and 7 year old really like it. I used sweet Asian chili sauce and I used 1 cup of orange juice and 1 1/2 cups of water in place of the 3 cups of water. It was quick and easy to prepare and a tasty way to use my ground bison that I had purchased. Definitely a keeper!",

Which was fine with the meatball part it was the sauce. I tend to be one that tries to follow recipes to a T if all possible. The sauce was tasty but you need to note that: 1. drain your pan of any residual fat and oil before adding the ingredients for the sauce. It makes for a very greasy sauce and it prevents your sauce from thickening. 2. I had so much liquid it looked like soup hubby agreed too but because there was so much liquid we didn't find the recipe that spicy. Will make again but if I'm doubling the meat I won't be doubling the liquids 6 cups of water didn't seem like a lot at first until it took me 2 hours to get the liquids to reduce and thicken.",

I too used sriracha and added a single-serving size of mandarin oranges because they needed to go, and a smidge of ground ginger because I take every opportunity to use it. I used the ground pork I had on hand and the meatballs cooked up with amazingly little fat left.  The simmer time was magic, the sauce thickened up just like you said it would.  It was delicious as well as pretty to look at, and so easy.  I would never have tried something like this without you.  It's now a regular recipe for both home and potlucks.  Thanks, Chef John!",

Once reduced I returned the meat to continue cooking a tad. My family loves ALL of Chef John's recipes - perhaps he can have someone proof read for him?",
