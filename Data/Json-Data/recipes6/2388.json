I didnt have any ketchup so I used A1 sauce. It was a good decision but it was a just a little over the top. \n100% would make again. My only tiff is that the directions never specified how to chop the mushrooms. So i quartered them. It worked out great. They had a fun texture and I love the taste of mushrooms. I would say the original intention was to coarsely chop them. Also no directions as far as when to add the flax seed mixture. I just mixed it with the cooked lentils and the veggies. No problems.  \nSeriously it was a great meal.",
