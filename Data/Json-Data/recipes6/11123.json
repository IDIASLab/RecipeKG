Plus we're a chocolate-loving family so I wanted to overturn the status quo.:-) I omitted the extra 1/3 cup sugar cause the cake mix is plenty sweet on its own; also omitted the oil in the glaze and used a little extra lemon juice. I was also tempted to put a little vase of flowers in the middle of the bundt but left it alone. This is one cake I'll look forward to making again - thanks!",
