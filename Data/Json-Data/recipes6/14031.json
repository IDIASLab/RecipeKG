I had to omit the nuts for my daughter and I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar with a tsp of vanilla and some extra cinnamon and then did a very light drizzle of maple syrup over the apple before I added the flour mix. I think that maybe 55 minute was a bit to long for my oven. Next time i will start checking it after 45 or so. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
