Followed the recipe exactly, except I used a reduced fat pre-made graham cracker crust.  With this substitute, the pie was practically guilt-free, and certainly worth every bite--YUM! Between three people, the pie was gone in less than 40 minutes!  The pie crust wasn't a deep dish, so I had some filling left over--baked it in ramekins along w/ the pie in the same oven and for the same amount of time. UPDATE:  Made this last night, only used 1 c. of sugar, and increased the lemon juice to 1/2 c.--I LOVE lemon, and this small change made it healthier and even tastier too!  You can also make this with no crust, in a pie plate w/ some no-stick spray, or in little individual ramekins...the baking time and temp. is still the same.  Without the crust, it's less than 150 calories per serving and has only 2 grams of fat, but still has a deliciously decadent taste:)",

The one there was heavenly, and this one is just as good.\r\n\r\nI haven't made a lot of pies, but this recipe is simple and produces great results.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I even had to make another one the day after because of the demand.  The pie comes out spongy on top and custardy on bottom and VERY lemony.  A must for the holidays or any occasion.  I used a standard pie pan (9\")but I had a lot of leftover filling, so for my second pie I used a larger, deep dish pie pan (10\" with a 2\" depth) which was just right.",

The sponge part was mostly good but the bottom part was runny like other users had mentioned. I don't know that more time in the oven would have helped because I had it in for another 10 minutes and I was about to burn the top part. The crust since it was not previously baked never cooked on the bottom. I am thinking if I would have baked the pie crust for about ten minutes and then poured the lemon mixture in it would have helped the crust as well as finish baking the rest of the lemon stuff as well. Something that I will try next time.",

Normally that wouldn't be a problem but even the little bit of smoke my oven produced managed to sink into the top 1/4 inch of the pie. lemon sponge pie should never have a smokey flavor.

Prebaked pie crust for 7 minutes @350 (docked the heck out of it first) and glad I took that advice from other reviewers. I would also use a deep dish 10\" crust if possible as this make plenty of filling. Mine turned out with a 1/2 layer of custard and 1/2 light fluffy sponge on top. I get requests for recipe often. With minor tweaking this was the best lemon pie & I make it often. Not much work either in my opinion. I topped with homemade whipped cream flavored with a bit of the zest and 1/4 tsp of lemon extract - SO GOOD! Based on any negative reviews I wonder if high altitude has something to do with that? Baking has to be altered at higher altitudes - just a thought. Note: I've made this numerous times using above measurments. Turns out perfect every time but I am near sea level for baking. Try this one. I'm glad I did even tho I had no clue what the heck 'sponge' pie was all about:)",
