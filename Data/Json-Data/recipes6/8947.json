                "reviewBody": "This meatloaf is unique. I enjoyed the mix of Turkey and beef as well as the vegetables packed in it. The taco seasoning is a unique add. Without a sauce on top, I felt like it should have been crumbled and put in a tortilla because it just tasted like taco meat. I made a sauce to go on top of the meatloaf that really made this recipe awesome. Here is what I used: 1/2c ketchup, 1/8c to 1/4c Heinz 57 or A1 (depends on your taste preference), 1/2tsp liquid smoke, and 1/2tbsp Dale\u2019s or Moore\u2019s marinade. With the sauce, this is a great way to get the family to eat more vegetables and I would definitely recommend it.",
