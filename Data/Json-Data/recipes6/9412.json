Instead of broccoli I used one box of spinach, thawed and drained. I added sauteed onion, salt and pepper. Next time I will add some dry mustard and chopped red pepper to spice it up a bit. 50 minutes was too long though, it got a little toasty - be sure to watch yours at 45 minutes. Be aware - this is a big recipe, use a big mixing bowl and if you use pie plates for your quiche you will need 2. I used a 9 x 9 pan and it was perfect, but it did make it look more like a casserole than a quiche. I can't quite decide if I like the baking mix crust or not, it is easy but I guess I just miss the good old fashioned pie crust. I think I will try it next time without. Hmmm, all the possibilities! I can't wait to make this again and again!",
