Yes, the batter is thick. I used light sour cream instead of the yogurt, because I had it on hand. The secret is to barely mix the wet ingredients into the dry. Then use a spoon to spread the batter in the pan. I also drizzled the glaze on as soon as getting the cake out of the oven. This is yummy either hot, or room temp. Delicious and beautiful!",

I really loved this coffee cake because it wasn't overly sweet and \"cakey\" like some coffee cakes can be. I didn't have any raspberries on hand so I substituted with frozen peaches and strawberries and absolutely LOVED it. I also subbed Greek yogurt for regular. I panicked a little when it came time to \"pour\" the batter because my batter was far from \"pourable\". Instead I used a greased spoon to spread it in the pan. I was surprised by how moist and springy the cake was (if you're concerned about it being TOO soggy, try reducing the amount of sugar added to the berries as this produces quite a bit of liquid). I can't wait to try this again with different fruit combinations!",
