Like a previous review,  The sweet and savory flavor of this dish pairs beautifully with a ham. It would also be great addition to a brunch buffet.   I agree with some of the earlier reviews that the tidbits are much easier to eat.  I mix the pineapples with the dry ingredients and add a splash of pineapple juice to keep it moist.   We have always used Ritz crackers but I love the idea of the Cheez-its and will be trying that soon!  I finely crush the crackers to the consistency of bread crumbs which elevates the presentation.  Don't skimp on the toppings and use as much as you need to make a 1/2 inch topping.   This is good old fashioned comfort food at it's very best!!!!",
