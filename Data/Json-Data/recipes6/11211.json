When finishing putting batter and apples into pan, I drizzle the juice from the apples on top for a finishing touch. It also seems important in the way you mix the batter. First I start with beating the eggs and sugar together; combine the flour, salt and baking powder together; then add alternately the flour mixture and oil, then the orange juice, then lastly the vanilla. This cake comes out perfect every time! Always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe.",

The only difference I made in the recipe was to follow my friends advice and mix the cinnamon/sugar with the apple slices instead of sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar over the apples.  That gave the apples a delicious flavor in the cake.\nAt 350 degrees it took 85 minutes to come out perfectly.",

I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze with almond extract over the top and down the sides. Made for a beautiful and delicious cake. Everyone loved it!",

My oven's temperatures are consistent, so it is not an equipment malfunction.  Unfortunately, I chose to try this recipe for Thanksgiving tomorrow, and now I have no cake to take to my mother-in-law's house.\r\n\r\nI would DEFINITELY recommend checking the cake after 45-50 minutes.",

Mine didn't need as long to bake -- only an hour. Also be generous with the apple -- it bakes so nicely in the cake.",
