There is more than enough \"stuff\" to fill that Bundt pan take some and place a single layer in a 8 or 9 inch single layer cake pan too. One or two things that I'd change are: the note to preheat at the beginning. Wait intil that last 'punch' and into the 45 minute rise after that. Also add about a third again to the butter and sugar-cinnamon for dipping and rolling any left overs can be drizzled and dusted over the top of the pile in the pan. A winner with my crowd.",

I would have given it 5 stars but I think the recipe is a touch off somewhere. I added at least another 2 cups of flour, if not more, along the way to get it to a recipe I could at least touch and not be totally covered or it being like a batter.  I,also, ended up using more sugar and cinnamon but we have a bit of a sweet tooth in the house. What was left over, I just mixed with the butter and poured over the top. Extra, crunchy goodness! LOL!  I don't think this recipe is for the beginner baker though. It requires lots of time and patience, and sometimes, trial and error.   This is a fantastic recipe! I wouldn't attempt it if you didn't have a lot of time to spare. It took me around 4 hours from start to finish. I knew going into it that it was going to take a while so I was prepared.   It is well worth all the time you put into it! I will upload some pics. ",

Always read through a recipe before you start: I preheated my oven when it said to..not sure why considering it takes four hours to make. Which I also didn't realize. Guess we'll be having coffee cake for lunch not breakfast. Also I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt and went ahead and rolled (spooned) it out to try to knead before letting it rise. Spooned it right back in the bowl and let it rise for an hour and a half then added a layer of flour on the top and a bunch of my dough mat. It was still pretty sticky but doable. It's rising for the second time now..I hope it's worth all the time and mess.",
