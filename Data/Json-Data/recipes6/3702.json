I did realize at the last minute that this called for chicken legs- and my family isn't really into chicken legs.  I had some boneless, skinless chicken thighs in the freezer I ended up using and they were excellent.  I think this would be good with chicken breasts too and I will probably go that route next time.  I might even consider marinating the chicken in the sauce before baking.  That sauce is SO GOOD!  I served the chicken thighs over white rice.",

I used chicken thighs instead of legs and would recommend baking them skin side down for about 15 minutes and then finishing them off skin side up.  I also let the chicken marinade about an hour because that's how much time I had - longer would be fine too.  And lastly, I slowly reduced the marinade while the chicken was baking and spooned it over the chicken and rice when serving.  I'll probably try using a little less sugar and/or honey next time.",
