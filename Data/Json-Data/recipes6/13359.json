Don't be put off by having to separate the skins from the pulp..it's worth the effort. I don't add the butter it doesn't need it. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.",

I've made it (although very time-consuming) for family and friends and this pie always receives unbelievable accolades. Most people have never even tasted something like this before. It's so unique. Don't even attempt to make it without buying yourself a food mill if you don't already have one. The work for this pie is worth the effort and those grapes only come available once a year in the fall. Thanks so much for this recipe. My mom would be proud.",

I even cut the sugar down to 1 cup, but it's still too much.  It also needed more flour, so I added 1/2 cup instead of 1/4.  I think this pie would be best with 1/2 cup sugar and without the butter.  It's just too rich the way the recipe tells you to make it.  It's a very fun idea, though.  A grape pie!  Who would have thought of such a thing?  My hands aren't purple, but my tongue sure is.",

Try putting up a dozen jars of pie filling...it takes a whole day. However there is a modern solution! This year we found a seedless version of the Concord grape. I believe it's called Coronation? Anyway it cuts the prep time in half and yields a pie that is just as tasty. In my version I found that 3-1/2 cups of grapes made ample filling. I wouldn't recomend 5 cups unless you have a deep dish. I cut the sugar back to a single cup but prefer a crumb topping to a double-crust. It's a combination of brown sugar butter and flour.",
