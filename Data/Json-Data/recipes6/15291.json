I changed the recipe slightly when I made it--adding a bit more white chocolate (250grams) and reducing the sugar a bit. Also I didn't have buttermilk in the house so i used two (125g) pots of natural unsweetened yoghurt. The yoghurt worked really well to cut the sweetness of the cake and helped to make it extremely moist. The only thing i noticed was that the cooking time wasn't accurate. This could be due to the cake pan i used--anyway--the cake took about an hour to cook and i lowered the temperature to 150 C after 35 minutes to prevent the top from becoming too brown. To serve the cake i turned it upsaide down and put chopped white chocolate on top as decoration! Enjoy!",
