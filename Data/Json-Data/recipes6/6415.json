I found that when I added a bit less oil to the pan and mixed some finely ground plain bread crumbs with the pretzels that helped some. I would definitely grind the pretzels well. I would even suggested a food processor or blender. The large pieces do not adhere as well as the ground pretzel after cooking. It was very quick to make for a fast meal. I preferred them without a dipping sauce but served some yogurt ranch with them. We are just not a fan of blue cheese dressing despite it being traditional and I did not want it going to waste. This would be a good recipe for a quick weekend meal. ty",
