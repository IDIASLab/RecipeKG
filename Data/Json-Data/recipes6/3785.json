I checked the original recipe that had been submitted and there is no sweetener listed. I knew we would not care for these made as written so I went ahead and added 1/2 cup sugar. The ratio of pumpkin-cheesecake mixture to the crust and streusel is way off. More filling is needed. They were just ok, but not something I would make again.",
