First of all I used 3 very ripe bananas instead of 1 that increases moisture quite a bit. I heaped the peaunt butter I used 2 whole eggs instead of just the whites. Also I used 1 cup of the wheat flour and 1 heaping cup of the white flour. I added 1/2 tsp salt and skipped the raisins. They were cakelike but tons of PB and banana flavor so good. And the oatmeal made them chewy. Also I cooked them at 350 for about 8-9 minutes but I have a hot oven you just gotta watch them and don't overcook. Thanks for a great recipe Gretchen!!: )",

For those who want a definite banana flavor to these make sure you use a brown overripe banana and you'll get the nice taste of it in the cookies. I did make some modifications and they still came out excellent. First I cut back on the white sguar by 1/4 cup added 1 t cinnamon used chunky PB and left out the raisins entirely. I baked these at 325 for about 18 minutes and they were just perfect. With my modifications there are 114 calories/cookie with almost 3 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. Super tasty will make again and again.",

I mixed ingredients according to directions then put the dough into the refridgerator for 10 minutes to chill used a silicone baking mat then baked at 350 degrees for 9-12 minutes.

I used 3 bananas which sweetened them enough where I can probably reduce the sugar next time. Beware if you increase the bananas though - the peanut butter flavor won't come through as much. Adding some chopped peanuts might do the trick. Also I subsituted Splenda for all of the sugar added the yoke from one of the eggs and added 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed. Half a cup of raisins was plenty especially if you plump them first (I covered them with water and microwaved for 30 seconds). These could also use a pinch of salt but were fine without. Overall these were a terrific wholesome snack and were perfection with a glass of milk!",
