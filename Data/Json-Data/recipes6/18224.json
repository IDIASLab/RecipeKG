As written, this is only about 3 stars(no spice in the batter for an apple muffin?) but with tweaking became a 5 star and they were delicious...so averaged out to 4 stars.  I shredded 1 cup of the apple to give more even distribution and add moisture throughout and chopped the 1/2 cup.  I also did this first and added the sugar to the apples to help leach out the juice to make the batter not so thick.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the batter, and 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown. Used the 1/2 cup butter but also added a couple of heaping tbsp. of applesauce. With that tweaking, just added 1 tsp. vanilla.  These made 6 Texas size muffins and baked up like a picture and were very moist.  The streusel topping is great and if you mix the flour and brown sugar well before adding the butter, you won't get those clumps of brown sugar that cause 'sinkers'.",

So that you do not have to read previous reviewers, these are the most suggested changes to rec, which I also followed: Double the amount of apples ( do half shredded, half chopped), add 1 tsp of cinnamon to dough, do 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. For strudel topping I melted the butter so that I do not have it that crumbly and it was perfect, did not sink into muffins for sure. Thanks",

I didn't measure how much apple I used by cups - I just used 2 normal sized apples, grated one and chopped the other.  The grated apple just disappears into the batter.  Next time I make these I will use one grated apple and two chopped apples (don't chop too small.)  I didn't bother using baking apples, just used a red delicious and a gala 'cause that's what I had.  I made the \"To Die for Blueberry Muffins\" the same day so I just split the topping between the two batches - for me it's too much topping for one batch.  The batter really does come out looking like cookie dough, so don't be afraid that you did something wrong, it's supposed to be like that.  By the way - a tip for getting the muffin out of the pan if you aren't using paper cups, is to use a pineapple knife to get underneath it.  Works great.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe looked okay on paper but really didn't work out for me. At all. The muffin batter was very dry and that was after I only put in a cup and a half of flour. The reason I only put a cup and a half of flour in is because after I mixed the wet ingredients together it was quite obvious there wasn't near enough liquid to moisten two cups of flour. I guessed by looking at the batter with the cup and a half of flour that a half cup of milk might be just enough to moisten the muffin batter enough to actually make muffins. When I made the strudel it looked fine but when I went to bake it the mixture bled all over my oven and started a fire. NOT HAPPY. I'm not a baking novice by any means and I do make quite a bit of muffins for my family--this recipe was an absolute flop for me. Not only am I angry that I wasted the ingredients I now have to scrape the sugar off the bottom of my oven. I really wish I'd thought to read the reviews before I made this one or skipped this recipe all together. Cheers to those who made this recipe and had a success--I did not.",

It also packs well for the West Coast Trail visitors that I send off with breakfast. I like to put the topping in a middle layer and on top. It's best fresh because the aroma from the oven is fabulous but I admit the leftovers are just fine too. Doubling the recipe is the only way to have leftovers!",
