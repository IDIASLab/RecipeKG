And I will not be making any changes!\n2. I was concerned that the 4 c. milk (I used whole milk because no almond milk on hand) would not be enough for the 2 C. oats but the consistency turned out perfect and I will NOT change that ratio in the future\n3. This milk:oats ratio yielded a very thick, slightly chewy oatmeal. Exactly the way steel cut oats should be served, IMHO.\n4. I used 1 smallish granny smith apple and 1 large braburn apple, peeled, cored, and sliced.\n5. I toasted my walnuts \u2013 as always\n6. I used the full \u00bd c. brown sugar and was satisfied, although I typically like it a bit sweeter, but you can always add more on top afterwards.\n7. Thank GOODNESS I used a crock pot liner \u2013 I started this at 10 pm and turned it off at 6:30 \u2013 it was done, stuck to the sides, and needed stirring, but it was not burnt.\n8. Even if I had raisins on hand, I would not have added them before cooking \u2013 they turn out mushy and should instead be added as a garnish.\nTHANK you for the recipe!! This will be written in to my permanent recipe book!!",

We don't particularly care for steel-cut oats so I used regular oatmeal. I checked the cooker at 3 hours it was done and starting to stick a little on the bottom. It well may be that my slow cooker's \"low\" setting is hotter than many and maybe not using steel-cut oats had something to do with it but I would not let this cook overnight. I don't mean that comment to sound negative but I would suggest using some caution on cooking time. For our tastes it also was too sweet so I'll try cutting the brown sugar in half in the future. This is really a tasty recipe and I have some containers going into the freezer to be enjoyed later by reheating in the microwave.",
