But I was not sure if the meat should be cooked before adding, so I cooked the meat before adding the egg and bread crumbs to be on the safe side. My kids liked them esp since they could eat them with their hands. I was a little impatient waiting to flip them becasue I was in a hurry, so I put them in the oven until I was done cooking them all to make sure they cooked thru. I will be making these again. I think I will try usung sausage and them freezing them. They would be great to reheat for a quick breakfast on the go.",

I followed the recipe exactly using some cayenne pepper in the potato mixture and Italian bread crumbs in the ground beef. These came out so delicious! As I was frying it the thought hit me that I could have added some shredded cheese on top the ground beef. I ended up serving these with a generous grating of cheddar cheese on top with ketchup and hot sauce as a dip. I initially started off eating these with a fork but soon realized I could eat them like a burger! These would make a different but good lunch for kids to carry to school. Maybe by adding the cheese in the middle and seasoning the meat mixture with BBQ sauce to eliminate the need for any dip. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

Also I posted this as a very basic recipe, I dont like posting complex recipes because everyone has their own taste and others may not like what I do. This is just an idea, I encourage you to add your own herbs and spices, and whatever else sounds good to you. I'm sure you will enjoy it more if you make it your way. I also wanted to add that you really need to squeeze all the liquid out. Its a bit tricky because it seems as though more liquid keeps coming out. So I suggest as you are forming them, keep squeezing the extra liquid out. That might be the reason some people had trouble with them falling apart.\n\nBrowla1,\nI wrote the recipe and there is no need to pre cook the meat filling, the frying time should be enough to cook the meat through.",

Secondly I will because of the response do this again. I had enough egg substitute to use in the potato mixture and only one egg left in the fridge which I used for the \"filling\". My filling was a good premium breakfast sausage! I omitted the garlic (no big fan here) and used maybe a couple tablespoons finely diced onion. I pre-cooked the sausage and onion so the onion wouldn't be crunchy just until the pink was gone in the meat drained it really well and then continued with recipe as written. I put a drizzle of maple syrup on mine and the GK's wanted a dusting of powdered sugar on theirs. Big tall glasses of OJ steaming coffee and a delicious breakfast was enjoyed by all!!",
