I wasn't sure if this \"fancier\" version of baked peaches would be worth the trouble but I tried two of the peach halves with just butter brown sugar and cinnamon as most baked peach recipes out there call for and I have to say that in this case the simple version which I can only describe as \"very sweet\" didn't quite compare. I think maybe the brandy and the pinch of salt lent this sauce a touch of sophistication and slight savoury-ness that made it stand out.",
