Here's where I differed from the recipe: Edit: It seems strange that 8 oz of cream cheese is mentioned twice separately. I made this w only one 8 oz Cream Cheese and feel pretty sure that is how it's supposed to be. Only use one 8 ounce package. -I didn't include spinach so I put in more mushrooms (6-8 ounces is good!) -I didn't have garlic powder so I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt instead. -I made it using only a microwave toaster oven and stove top! Ran out of propane and didn't have time to wait for delivery; so I was left finding a recipe I could make w/o oven. -Not completely necessary but well worth it: used the toaster oven to toast 3 slices cubed plain wheat bread which I drizzled drawn butter on after toasting. Added to the top of casserole after done cooking in microwave.) -Used one beef bullion cube in a cup of hot water. (that's the only broth I had on hand.) -my 9X13 casserole is aluminum so I had to make this in halves using my square glass 8\"x8\" (20cmx20cm) in the microwave (so I wouldn't start a fire.) Veggie ingredients should be as dried out as possible b4 cooking in microwave so it doesn't end up watery. I started off drying the asparagus and artichokes together by heating in microwave in 3 minute spurts then tossing repeat. Keep mushrooms separate from asp & artichokes bc you need the shrooms to be in the saucepan while melting cream cheese in heavy whipping cream and 1 cup broth. I dried",
