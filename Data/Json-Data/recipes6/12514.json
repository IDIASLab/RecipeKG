The dought i baked today was in the refrig. for 5 days and it was sooooo sticky. Didn't have a problem with the previous ones which i baked the next day. /I made a batch of apple filled (apple pie filling with a little cinnamon) and another batch with nutella and crushed hazelnuts. In my opinion, fruit is the way to go. These were delicious. The kids liked the nutella ones too but i think they were a little too sweet. The Nutella is least likely to \"leak\" in the oven and they seemed easier to handle when they are still hot. The fruit ones stay softer longer after cooking them so i had to wait a little longer for them to \"set\" so they could be transfered to the serving dish. No Biggie!! I was just in a hurry and i needed my cookie sheet to bake some more. I love this recipe so much i want to try all kinds of fillings in it. You should try it too!",

Definitely go with parchment if you want an easy clean up! If you're like me and don't like the hassle of rolling out dough, you can also shape these into 1\" balls, then press the balls flat with the bottom of a glass - much less work & mess! Finally, use high-quality preserves for your filling - it will make a difference!",

I filled them with picadillo (ground beef, potatoes, carrots, etc.) and brushed some egg on top to make them golden brown.  They were a hit.  I used lots of flour when rolling out the dough, as others had suggested, and I floured the wax paper on the cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick (the first batch stuck even to the wax paper).  They weren't ready after 20 minutes so I cooked them for almost 30 and they turned out great.  Thank you for this Christmas Eve hit. Oh, my sister suggests a little bit of salt in the dough.  I liked it as is, though.",
