Most were gone within an hour. I'd make them slightly smaller than a tablespoon size. They really spread out when baked and mine all overla[ped. I had to cook for 9 mins, as 8 mins made the centers too wet. Let them sit for 5 minutes minimum on the cookie sheets or they will fold up funny on the spatula. Great recipe I will make again!",

I used parchment paper and that might be my bonus verses the last review who said her spread. I totally try to cut extra oils where I can but follow the recipes to the best of a T as possible. I didn't change anything with the cookie type part at all. The frosting center was slightly thick so I adjusted with a little more milk to make it just a bit creamier. Not much but I wanted that slightly ooze affect. And I'd say the frosting didn't taste of marshmallow but that's okay. Because the recipe was quite nice.",

It was unclear how large the drops needed to be on the cookie sheet and how far apart they needed to be I did about a tablespoon-size and a couple inches apart which worked out perfect. I had my oven at 340 Fahrenheit convect and they were done in about 9 minutes. I let them cool on the cookie sheet about 5 minutes and transferred to cookie rack. The filling however did not work for me at all! I didn't have enough shortening so I substituted butter instead and the filling emulsified and melted butter got everywhere. But it was still extremely delicious. The recipe made a whopping 32 whoopie pies way more than I was expecting! Next time I will probably either make just a meringue for the filling or whipped cream. But very tasty!",

I hate to see raters substitute ingred. and then rate it poorly..baking is a science so adjusting or substituting can really wreck a good recipe...trust me the cake is perfect no other recipe will be the same. Disolving the baking soda in water then adding it makes all the difference. And again fillings are always subject to preference.",

This recipe does make a lot but that was fine for me. I used a small ice cream-like scoop probably a tablespoon size and they were the perfect size for my needs. I baked them for 9 minutes and that was perfect soft and cakey. I took them to a Super Bowl party this past weekend and they were a hit. I did not fill them with the filling from this recipe instead used a filling from the Martha Stewart website it was more marshmallow-like which I liked. I will try the filling from this recipe next time because I had to make two batches of the other filling.",
