I hope this review (and my posted pics) will change that! It's very moist, with a large, fluffy, but light and tender crumb. It definitely is fun and pretty, and you can clearly taste the distinct flavor of each of the lime, lemon and orange layers, each as delicious as the next. Given the mixed reviews for the filling and frosting, however, I did not use those particular recipes though I did prepare it with a lemon filling and an orange buttercream - specifically, \"Lemon Cream,\" and \"Golden Orange Frosting\" - both great recipes as well and both complemented the cake nicely. This is much more labor intensive and time consuming than your average layer cake, but so worth the effort! This was a home run, not just for hubs and I, but with his staff as well. This cake will do any baker proud!",

Here in Louisiana, it is sometimes hard to find recipes that are light enough to serve in the summer yet still presentable enough for any important occasion...  I baked this one for my mom-in-law's retirement party, and there wasn't a scrap left!  I'm here printing it again a year later to bake it for a baby shower I'm hosting...  \r\n\r\nHere's something I did to decorate the cake:  I stuck with the original recipe, because I like the delicate flavoring of the citrus fruits (I'm sure the oils makes it wonderful, but I like the light flavor!) and I candied orange, lemon and lime peels and used them to decorate the sides of the cake!  It's a really easy way to add to the cake without overwhelming it!   (Brandi, Baton Rouge, LA)",

I used zests as directed but added a tablespoon of lime juice orange essence and lemon extract for an extra punch of flavor. The lime layer turned out to be the most mild in flavor and the orange came out tasting quite artificial. I used jarred lemon curd between the layers and then frosted with Cool Whip; so lots of changes but much quicker and a little lighter in fat and calories.",

I didn't find the cake especially complicated to prepare and though it was kind of time consuming that was only because I only had one cake round and had to bake off each layer one at a time.
