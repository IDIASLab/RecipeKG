I tried another salad with pears and feta and didn't care for the combo so knew in advance I would change the fruit. I used iceberg and spinach (what I had); made the dressing per the recipe; used fresh sectioned oranges; no cheese. We very much enjoyed this salad. And...glazed walnuts would probably be very good in this salad; add another dimension.",

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and white balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I cut the dressing s sugar back because I knew it would be too sweet for us and gave it an extra shake of hot sauce but that s just a personal taste preference. I assembled it a bit differently than in the instructions mixing the salad greens and the dressing together (setting aside a little dressing) and then placed the onions and pears on top sprinkled the salad with the walnuts (which I d toasted) and the feta cheese and then just drizzled the remaining dressing over each salad. This one s going into my Favorites file awesome salad!",
