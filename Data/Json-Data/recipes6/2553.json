I realize that reduces the nutritional value but the muffins had to be tasty too. I added a bit of ground flaxseed left out the oil and increased the milk. I subbed pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Oh and I made some with chopped apple instead of blueberry. All in all they turned out well.",

I used whole milk not skim as that's what we have and use and I believe whole is actually healthier for you anyways. 2. I used 1.5 cups of blueberries and no walnuts.
