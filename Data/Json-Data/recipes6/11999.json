For this recipe the quality of your butter makes a big difference.  If on the side of the box it states that it \"meets specifications for grade declared\"  then you can count on a low butter quality.  Use only the best butter you can afford.  Also for this recipe I use extra large eggs.  This helps with the texture and makes the dough easier to work with.  I also add an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  If the dough is still too soft after trying these suggestions, I have found that using half butter half shortening works every time.",

Not to mention the trouble of adding all that flour. I reduced the amount of milk to 1/4 cup and added it in teaspoons as I mixed but that still didn't help -- neither did freezing the dough for an hour although it did make it slightly easier to work. If you don't mind all that then the recipe is worth it for the soft taste (altho I did add about a tablespoon of lemon rind). However I will definitely be using a different recipe for sugar-cookies.:(",

For me the instruction to \"knead in enough flour\" is wonderful because I often times find that recipes which are too strictly written do not turn out right for me. With this recipe it is more to the taste of the baker than to that of the recipe writter. What amazes me the most with this recipe is how wonderfully the dough can be rolled out thin then puff beautifully when baked. The almost cakelike consistancy when rolled thick makes them perfect for Black and White cookies. This recipe is a family favorite now in our house hold after I made christmas cookies with it last year and they didn't last longer than one afternoon!",
