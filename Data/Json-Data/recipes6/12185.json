Spreading the batter in the pan is a mucky job, but ultimately it's worth it.  I chose to broil the marshmallows until lightly browned, which only takes about 40 seconds in my oven--unfortunately, on my first try I let them sit for about a minute and a half--hey, at least I know my smoke detector works. . .  Finally, these are not by any means an elegant or sophisticated bar--but kids positively inhale them!  They are ooey, gooey, sticky delicious fun--I should know, I've certainly eaten my share today.",
