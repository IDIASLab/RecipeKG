For those of you who make it and don't know what to expect...these are not intended to have a flavor explosion; they are about the texture and mild sweetness.  Some people add the almond extract for more flavor, I like them the way they were intended to be made...without extract.  An added tip...use a small cookie scoop so they stay round and symmetrical.  You can also add another teaspoon of vanilla for a little more sweetness.  Lastly, the lemon icing isn't quite right for this cookie...just use a powdered sugar/milk icing, and it adds even more sweetness to the taste of the cookie.",

After reading reviews I decided to be skimpy on the icing (because of complaints about it being too sweet) and I'm glad I did.  I also decided to use almond extract instead of lemon (just because it's my favorite) and skip the colored sprinkles or colored sugar. My family liked these a lot.  Here's a tip to reduce the mess on the glazing process - a little cheat thing I saw on a tv show:  I put my glaze in a ziploc bag, sliced just a tiny tip of one corner, and then just drizzled the glaze over the cookies while they were still on the cookie sheet to the desired thickness.  No muss, no fuss. And I always bake my cookies on sheets lined with foil so there's also no clean-up.  Just toss the glazey foil away!  I'll make these again at Easter time and do the colored sugar/sprinkles to be festive.  This goes in our permanent recipe file.",

To the 4 cups of conf sugar, add 2 heaping Tbl. of \"Just Whites\", a powdered egg white that you can find in the baking aisle of your supermarket. Add enough lemon juice (not extract) to make a thick paint-like consistency (not icing thick!) Dip each cookie in the mixture and allow to dry, about 1/2 hour. Icing will harden in a thin glaze. You can also use water or milk instead of lemon juice, as well as food coloring or other flavoring. When decorating sugar cookies that are cut w/cookie cutters, you can apply this icing more precisely with a small paint brush. (If you're going to further decorate with sugar or sprinkles, do it before it dries.) When they harden, you can stack them without the icing smearing all over. Enjoy!!",

I added grated lemon peel to the dough which enhanced the flavor a lot. The cookies were a tad less exciting in comparison but still good. They formed well with my mini ice cream scoop and looked perfect when they came out of my oven after exactly 13 minutes. I think the glaze does taste very powdered-sugary. I agree that this is a huge batch of cookies and I spent way more time than I wanted to in my kitchen and after the mess I made on my counter with the glaze I might hesitate to make these again. I did enjoy doing something different departing from the good old chocolate chip cookie recipe as I needed to use some leftover ricotta. These are actually really better the next day I think!",

I originally made them with almond extract in place of the lemon and I still prefer them that way. But I made them along with maraschino cherry cookies for a reception so I made them as written with the lemon and everyone loved them. I volunteer weekly at a local hospice, in fact the first time I tried them was there and I made them to use up some leftover ricotta. One of the current residents asked me to make anise flavored cookies and said she likes soft cookies so I made these for her last week using anise extract. Today I had planned to make a Valentine's Day dessert but when I got to the hospice Laura asked me to make these again. Before I left she must have already eaten at least eight of them. So thank you, Lisa, for a great recipe and thank you for adding a little enjoyment to one woman's final days.",
