I always wanted to try it but never got around to it. Well I'm 52 now and finally made it for the first time this weekend. And you know what? I actually liked it! I did make a change but took that into consideration when rating it. Thirty-six crackers just didn't seem like enough in the premade deepdish piecrust I used so I added a third more a total of forty-eight crackers. This resulted in a pretty firm pie reminiscent of a chess pie and I realized that thirty-six crackers would have been just the right amount for a juicy pie so the 5-star rating is for the original recipe. But my son said he liked it the way I made it and that I should make it again just the same way so it also gets five stars for being versatile enough to handle the changes. And the flavor is apple-y enough to make you do a double take. I'd make this again even if my son didn't insist on it!",
