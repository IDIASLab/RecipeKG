I made my own spice mix, as suggested and also added chopped dates, which we both thought added a wonderful sweetness to the dish, while remaining authentic to Moroccan dishes. It has a wonderful flavor, not in your face or spicy, just very delicious. I also used butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes-I am a fan of both, so I think either, or both work just fine. I may add chicken sausages next time, as I will make it again. Also, I used boneless thighs, as I like to remove all the fat and it was just right! Try it-you\u2019ll like it!",
