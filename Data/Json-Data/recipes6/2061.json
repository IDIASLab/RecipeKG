Here's a summary:  Double all ingredients except brown sugar, make it 1/2 cup total.   Change cereal to 2 cups All Bran and 2 cups Bran Flakes (don't crush the flakes) Add one small mashed banana (preferably previously frozen so it's really soft)   Add milk to cereal mixture at the very end so that the milk doesn't get absorbed.  Be generous with the milk, I actually use 2 1/4 cups instead of 2 cups.  Also add the liquid ingredients first into the cereal/milk mixture and THEN pour into the dry ingredients.   Bake 24 mins at 375 F.  If you don't have a banana, a 1/3 cup plain applesauce also works well.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is perfect for me because lately I have had a lot of All Bran cereal to use up, AND it is the perfect way to use up a cup of milk when it is starting to get old. The method of curdling the milk with lemon juice is very practical and substitutes for buttermilk. Also, it only uses 1 egg. which is good because I buy the expensive cage free eggs and then tend to ration them because I am poor. I have made them with raisins, I have also made them with mulberries from a tree in my neighborhood which was also good. These muffins taste best fresh, so if I am not feeding them to others immediately I put the remainder of the baked muffins in my freezer and take them out the evening before when I want one or two in the morning. If they aren't given enough time to cook then they tend to fall apart. But when the cooking time is right and everything goes as planned they are very good. Really good cheap recipe that doesn't require fancy ingredients. I have made it at least about 4 times now.",

They are reminiscent of New England brown bread. They were very moist and had a lot of flavor. I used bran flakes and crushed them with my hands into tiny pieces and then measured my 1-1/2 cups of cereal. I also used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of the 1/8 tsp but prepared everything else as is. Make sure you use the dark brown sugar that is listed in the recipes instead of light brown because it gives you a light molasses flavor that you will not get if you use light brown sugar. I filled them slightly over 3/4 full which turned out perfect for my muffin tin because they didn't rise very much. I will definitely be making these again.",
