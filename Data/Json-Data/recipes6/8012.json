I agree with others in the baking time. All ovens are different, adjust accordingly. You may need less time. My recommendation would be to cover with aluminum foil if the top starts to brown too quickly.  Also, if you make half the recipe you can easily divide this into 3 and possibly 4 mini loaf pans. The batter might seem too thick and not enough to fill the mini molds. Well, I miscalculated and my 4 mini loaf pan overflowed. I could have made 3 or 4 mini loaves. Fill the pans about 2/3 of the size you are using.",
