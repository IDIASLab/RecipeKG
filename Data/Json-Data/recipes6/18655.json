Yes, do make sure you have ALL your \"ducks in a row\" before you start heating anything - plan ahead.  BONUS: Since 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice was just about one lemon, there was a little leftover.  There was leftover mint juice, too  - so I added the mint juice and lemon juice to a pot of iced green tea I had made.  Delish!  Mint-mania at our house.  Between the jelly & the tea, I knew something good would come out of our surprise mint patch (our mower broke and the lawn was HIDEOUSLY overgrown!)  When life breaks your mower, make mint jelly!",
