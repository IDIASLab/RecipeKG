When ever I make these I use the mini-tart shaper from pampered chef & I can make them really quickly. First I divide the dough in half then quarters then eighths I keep on this way until I have a little ball of dough in every space of 4 mini muffin tins. Then I use the mini tart shaper to form the cups. I submerse the tart shaper in flour between each cup. I can whip these out like nobodies' business.",
