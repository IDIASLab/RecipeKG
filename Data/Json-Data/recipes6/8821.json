They are very sticky and I had to refrigerate them overnight in order to be able to half-way roll them into balls. Once rolled, I again had to refrigerate them because they would not hold their shape. After another hour they were cold enough to roll but the nuts would not stick. I re-rolled them and with the warmth of my hands they softened enough to roll in the nuts. But then again they would not hold their shape. Again I refrigerated them and once cold I pushed them into balls. But within 5 minute they were again soft and gooey. With so many other recipes out there, this 'Easy' Rum Balls recipe is definitely not easy.",
