The granny smith batch was a bit wetter and much more flavorful while the red delicious batch was very low in flavor. I recommend using good tasty apples. I also used butter instead of shortening and 1 1/2 c. of finely chopped apples in each batch. This was great for the kid's apple fair at school.",
