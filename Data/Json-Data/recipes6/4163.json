I didn't change anything in the recipe, except that I forgot to halve the potatoes initially so I pulled them out part way through cooking to cut them, meaning they didn't darken up as much as if I had done it right the first time. The meal still turned out great. My whole family (including two younger picky eaters) devoured the meat and potatoes (obviously not the green beans, because, vegetables). The green beans didn't look overly appetizing, but they tasted phenomenal. The pork was just perfect. I will definitely be making this dish again.",

I marinated the pork in a zip lock bag for several hours and liked the results. It took longer than the 20 minutes but using the temperature probe to 145 degrees gave us a very nice juicy center.  The tiny potatoes are a must, they were oh so good.  Thanks for a great evening meal!",
