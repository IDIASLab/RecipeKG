I do add some extra things, like chopped cabbage, potatoes, and birds eye frozen mixed vegs.  I don't like lima beans so I leave them out.  The extra veggies make the soup take longer to cook but it is really DELICIOUS! **Try not to use pasteurized or canned crab meat or it will give the soup a \"fishy\" taste.  Fresh crab meat works the best (if you can find it in your area).",

Here is what changed:  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed (28 oz can), used Birdseye frozen veggies, which has green beans, corn and peas (2 small bags), 1 1/2 cups cubed potatoes, 1/2 cup chopped savoy cabbage, 2 cans (not cups) of beef broth (low sodium), 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 T. Worcheshire sauce.   3 Tablespoons of Old Bay was perfect for me, but for someone who isn't from the area, it might be a little too spicy.  I cooked it much longer on low (about 2 hours), but I don't serve it until the next day so all of the flavors can develop.      ",
