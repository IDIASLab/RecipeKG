I wrapped my 2inch thick filets with bacon. I then took 4 oz of feta (we don't like blue cheese) and mashed it with 2TBS of softened butter to make a paste. We like our filets medium rare so I broiled them 4 minutes on each side. At the last 2 minutes I put the cheese spread on and continued broiling until  it was bubbly and melted. Delicious! NOTE: it's important that while you are marinating these to leave them at room temperature. Filets should be allowed to rest at room temperature 30-60 minutes prior to cooking. This will ensure a juicy steak.",
