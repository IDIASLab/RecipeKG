Yes I might add a few more cherries next time because the cake is so dense and can feed so many people that it can handle another dozen cherries. I must say that this is not a recipe for children due to the alcohol but I still gave it a 5 star rating because it deserves it. Thank you so much Holly for sharing this recipe.

So that kids can enjoy the cake with the adults use grape juice cranberry juice for a dark fruit cake or light grape juice or apple juice for a light fruit cake. Reduce the 1lb of chopped pecans to 1.5 -2 cups chopped pecans. use more candied fruit (fruitcake mix pineapple cherries) and soak it in 3 cups fruit juice instead of 2 cups juice. also reduce both sugars to 1.5 cups each====4 cups sugar makes the cake toooooo sweet. Also if you don't have a 10inch cake pan (bunt is ttoooooo small for this cake) for this cake use 2 10 inch bunt cake pans or 2-3 loaf cake pan. the 10 in tube cake pans are very hard to find unless you go to a specialty shop or mail order",

Her cake was virtually nuts currants or raisins with batter to hold it all together. She used cheese cloth and stored the cake in a large pan. Every few days she'd sprinkle bourbon on the cake and onto a quartered apple that rested at the bottom of the cake in the center hole. after replacing the cheesecloth she sprinkled bourbon again over the whole thing and resealed the pan. It rested in the laundry room which wasn't heated. Please use a pan or kettle that can be securely closed up and the cake will be moist and delicious and yes dense with nuts raisins and good bourbon flavor. She always served the thin slices with a homemade hard sauce..it was great but not necessary.",
