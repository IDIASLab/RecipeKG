This method of cooking allows the chicken to sit flat as it roasts, ensuring that everything cooks evenly so the breast meat ends up just as juicy and succulent as the dark meat. The honey mustard marinade adds incredible flavor and works overtime as a sweet and tangy basting and serving sauce. Serve with roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts, if desired.",

Rather than 1/2 cup of Yellow Mustard, I opted for 1/4 Yellow and 1/4 \"chinese-style\" hot mustard for slightly extra heat/flavor. Everything else pretty much followed the recipe. Spatchcocking the chicken was a new technique for me. Not hard but definitely requires some more practice. \n\nAll in all, great simple recipe to prepare in anticipation. Prep in the AM and cook in the PM. Chef John did it again! :)",

I didn\u2019t marinate my chicken; I just used leg quarters and brushed the sauce on at a few stages during roasting. I also had some leeks and a couple of red potatoes in the same pan which got cooked in all the chicken and sauce drippings. Since I didn\u2019t use the sauce as a marinade I was able to dip my potato wedges in it without any extra cooking which I think is THE move to make this more of a one-pan situation.",

I turned down oven temp to 350 to finish, a total 70 min. The drippings were delicious stirred in the boiled marinade, made for a lovely sauce. Super moist breasts, caramelized skin. The juices were blackening so much which is why I turned temp down, and the chicken released more as it rested. Gotta have it for the sauce. I didn't add any salt at all and it was fine. It's great when you can make a delicious dish from easy ingredients from your pantry. Add a fresh chicken and you have a scrumptious sweet and spicy dinner. Smiles all around. Thanks CJ .",
