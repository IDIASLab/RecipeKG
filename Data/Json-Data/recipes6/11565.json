I made no other changes or substitutions. This was very easy to assemble, the directions absolutely outlined the steps clearly which was great because I made this dessert with my two boys. Just over 45 minutes was just right for me. It's cooling now but I'll update my review once my family as a chance to taste-test it. As it sits, it is a very pretty dessert. It looks like a chocolate chip cookie in cake form! NOTE: 45 minutes was WAY too long! DO NOT overbake, it becomes dry as heck. Because of my mistake, this turned out less than great. We ended up cutting away the edges and eating the middle, which was pretty freaking tasty. I was more upset that half of this got tossed as I hate waste. I'll make this again because it's really freaking good but I'll cut back on the baking time.",
