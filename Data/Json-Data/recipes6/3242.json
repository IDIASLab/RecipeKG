It doesn t take much time to get this dish into the oven and really all you need is time for some surprisingly absolutely delicious baked beans. The recipe didn t say whether or not to drain the beans but I didn t just dumped in the whole can. I did add a little salt and pepper and used red and yellow bell peppers instead of green otherwise followed the recipe. If you have a day where you re going to be hangin around the house give these beans a try. Alice Shockley you made a believer out of me!",
