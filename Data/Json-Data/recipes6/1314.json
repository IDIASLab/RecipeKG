This is a break from my traditional pumpkin pie recipe and we loved the graham crust and the silky smooth filling. I followed the recipe to the letter with one small deviation. We couldn't wait for it to cool so I topped each piece with the whipped cream instead of spreading it over the entire pie. It was nicely set even while still warm. Beautiful texture. We are looking forward to another taste tomorrow. Great recipe!",

I am allergic to egg whites so I only used the egg yolks by using an egg separator and also adding two measurements of an egg replacer to make up for the loss of egg whites (it was perfect). I also added a little cardamom to the mix. For the whipped cream I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. Overall it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I'll be making this every year. Thank you for this fantastic recipe.:-)",

My changes: I used 1 cup steamed acorn squash and 1 cup steamed kabocha squash instead of pumpkin. I love the flavor of both of those squashes more and they are much smaller to deal with and prepare than wrestling a big ol pumpkin. The acorn squash is lighter in texture than the kabocha so together the texture is a little different than straight pumpkin. I also used half the condensed milk as our family doesn't like stuff that's too sweet. Once I finished mixing it was plenty sweet for our tastes. I also used fresh grated ginger and 1 teaspoon prepared pumpkin spice. I wish I had fresh nutmeg and cinnamon. It would be out of this world if I had fresh spices. I think the best part is the lemon zest. It lifts the heaviness of the filling and gives it this really fresh light taste. I felt like the mix tasted just like fresh pumpkin ice cream and I was eating right out of the mixer!! Can't wait to bake it. I'm keeping the mix in the fridge overnight to let all the flavors come together. I think it's going to be a hit!",
