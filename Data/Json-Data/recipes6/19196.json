Light on the ketchup, no vinegar, light on the water, and definitely use paprika.  Use the water to get whatever consistency you like, but you need at least 1 Tbs. of dill pickle juice.  Trust me.

I did not add any water what-so-ever and I substituted the sugar for honey. Add garlic powder and black pepper to taste. Yummy! Not runny at all. We prefer this to the sauce we get at Japanese resturants mainly because we can give it some more kick with that cayenne pepper. Thanks for the excellent recipe guide!",
