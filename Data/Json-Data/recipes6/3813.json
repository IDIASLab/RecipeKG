I like heat, too (the cayenne did not come through), so the next time I make this, I will add chipotle for smoke and heat. \nSecond and perhaps more importantly, it definitely needs more tang to balance out the porky goodness. Maybe it just needs more apple cider vinegar, but next time, I'll substitute sour juice for half the water (orange or perhaps pineapple).\nThose two additions I hope will make it more like barbeque sauce -- smokey, spicy, tangy.",

I cut a large pork shoulder into 6 pieces and marinated them in the rub mixture inside an extra large zipper bag for about 24 hours.

I also felt like there were too many steps and too much hands on which took away from the ease the Instant Pot is supposed to provide. The pork was super tender though so I am giving this 4 stars. I would definitely make this again but would skip making the sauce and just use our favorite Kansas City style bottled sauce which would eliminate that extra step that I didn't care for that resulted in an overly sweet sauce.",
