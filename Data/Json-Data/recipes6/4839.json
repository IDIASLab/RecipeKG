Most of the recipes on here do not include carrots or celery, and I always add them to my soup and have never reviewed any other leek soup recipe because I change it so much. This recipe looks almost how I do it except I usually add a clove or two of garlic, lot's of black pepper and use all chicken stock. After making it, I did have to add some garlic and pepper just to get the flavour we like. I am not sure about the veggie stock though, I used an organic veggie stock that was a very dark mushroom colour, and I should of known by the smell of it I wasn't going to like it very much. But after it was all cooked, I still liked the soup, but next time I'll use a stock I know I like! This is still a great base for a soup, plenty of Leek flavour, very creamy. Just make sure if you use veggie stock, it is one you know and love, otherwise use a good quality chicken stock! I will be making this again, thanks for sharing your recipe. :)",
