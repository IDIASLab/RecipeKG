I have to confess that I subbed butter for olive oil and added about 1/2 tsp each of lemon and orange zest so the dough would have a stronger citrus flavor so maybe that is what made the difference. As I tried to shape the cookies I progressively added a little more OJ in hopes of making the texture of the dough more workable but I couldn't get it right. Finally I gave up on individual cookies and turned them into cookie bars instead laying them out in a 9 x 13 baking dish with dough on the bottom and filling on top. They baked up well tasted wonderful and cut into bars nicely. Our guests loved them and had no idea they were not intentionally cookies bars.",
