Too much sweet and goopy sauce, I couldn't eat mine.\" Made this as directed only using a frozen bag of tri-color bell pepper strips, and starting to brown the sausage b4 adding the veggies so it'd get a little more brown and crispy, the way we like it. The sauce was just sooooo glossy and thick and syrupy sweet. My husband loved it, me, not so much. I'd have to change the ingredient ratio around in order for me to eat it again in the future, and possibly add a veggie like broccoli to make it more of a stir-fry meal.",
