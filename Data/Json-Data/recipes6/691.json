It is also kid-friendly; haven't met a kid yet that don't like it! If your kid hates sauerkraut, try this. Quick and easy to make but does have a longer cooking time to reduce the liquids and bring out the sweetness. You can use it as a meal or a side dish and some family members, believe it or not, get a bowlful for a late night snack!",

He will not eat canned greens of any kind and even when eating fresh ones they cannot be too wilted or cooked. They must retain some of their bright green color. He is not a picky eater so this is the one thing I work around for him. So on that note I used fresh chopped greens and mixed them in after I pulled the dish out of the oven. I made one other change which wasn't necessary but something we really like and that is that I browned my sausage in a skillet prior to adding it to the kraut and sticking it in the oven.This dish had deep flavor and the kraut had a really nice caramel on it. Even scaled in half this recipe makes quite a bit so keep that in mind. If you are a kraut lover like me then I highly recommend you give this one a try!",
