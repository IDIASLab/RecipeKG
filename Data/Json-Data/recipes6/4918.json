I used homegrown jalapeno pepper, sweet potatoes and tomatoes, which made me happy to be able to use produce from my garden. Made about 1.5 of the recipe. I didn't have vegetable broth on hand and substituted with vegetable base Better Than Bouillon\", combination of kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans. No where in the instruction when to put tomato paste in, so I put it in with the sweet potatoes and spices. I also added a can of drained sweet corn at the end to balance the spices and heat. It turned out very good, nice and thick! Husband loved it as well. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper!",

Then one day we had a party and guess what! It was all vegan. Have I ever had something vegan? No. Did I ever think that I really would? Not really.  But let me tell you something; this chili is amazing.  I was kinda skeptical but when I tried it they actually were not that bad. This chili tasted like any other chili that I had had beside it being meatless. \nI do not like sweet potatoes, and in this recipe there are a lot of them. They were used as the meat substitute. However, you couldn\u2019t even really tell that they were in there. They were not to sweet and they soaked up all of the flavor of the rest of the chili. \nThe base of the chili was really good. It has a few different types of beans and many vegetables. Also, if you cook it right it is not a watery chili. Let's be honest, who wants a watery chili. But, it also was not a super thick chili. All of the different veggies in it all went together perfectly. \nThe chili wasn\u2019t too spicy but it also was not bland. It had a perfect balance of spicy and savory with just a hint of sweet from the sweet potatoes. To garnish it, it says you can put in cheese and sorry cream. But this was a vegan party so we did vegan sour cream and vegan cheese which was just as good.\nThis chili was amazing. With its accents of different flavors but also the balance of flavors. It smelled amazing and that me",
