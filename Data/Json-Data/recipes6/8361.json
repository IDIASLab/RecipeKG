Full recipe of topping with more cinnamon. Batter, did 1/2 but substituted a mix of milk and yogurt for the buttermilk, and used 2 eggs, and 1cup of rhubarb. This half of recipe made 12 muffins, so I thought maybe the original recipe used an extra large muffin pan? MAKE THESE EAT THESE BUT CONTROL YOURSELF. SOOO GOOD!",

Added approx. 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to it. \n\nFilling: reduced sugar to 1 tbsp.\n\nThey are so delicious! Great way to use up the slightly limp rhubarb in my fridge. :)",
