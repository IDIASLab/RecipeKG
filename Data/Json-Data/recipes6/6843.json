Thanks for the great recipe: everyone at church wants it. This chili had the most outstanding taste of any chili I had ever eaten.It isn't too hot either; just right. Thanks again!!!

Well I'm glad I went out on a limb to risk trying this chili for the first time for a New Year's Eve party my husband and I had. I followed it to the letter and thought the beef was going to be too tough to eat when it was done (the cubes were cut by the butcher and were quite large). As it cooked however the meat got very tender and all of the spices and the rest of the ingredients melded together for one of the best chilis I've ever had! Thanks for posting this one--and thank daddy for us! It's a keeper!",

I wasn't sure what type of mild chili powder/ground chile to use so I used some ground New Mexico chiles (rather than the store-brand chili powder that already has the cumin and garlic mixed in) and just a little cayenne (not the full amount of ground red chile pepper that the recipe calls for) and it was plenty spicy with a fantastic flavor. I also did not add the full amount of flour as it was plenty thick but the masa also added a very nice flavor. Goes very well with Amusement Park Cornbread from this site.",

I made this recipe for an Engagement Party last night and had numerous compliments. Three adjustments I made double the cumin increased the jalapenos to 1 and 1/2 and finely chopped them and cooked it for 3hrs. The increased cooking time took the meat from OK to melt in your mouth tender and the consistancy required no masa. No one had less than two bowls. Great recipe for those that don't like beans.

Here are the minor changes I made: I added a bit of liquid smoke used V8 instead of tomato sauce used regular paprika left out the jalapenos and didn't need the flour as I just estimated the water. I added a little ground black pepper forgot the oregano and cooked in a crock pot on low for several hours instead of simmering for convenience's sake. Also--I'm Texan and agree about the \"no beans\" rule but my waistline disagrees so I added one can of ranch beans and one can of kidney beans drained but not rinsed. My husband loved it said he could eat it every week. It was too spicy for the kids. Thanks for a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Something must have went wrong. This is not the Chili others have reviewed. I tried to follow the recipe to a \"T \" but made the following mods. I cooked it in a Roaster over 2 burners. I don't think that made a difference. I added 1 TBSP of Butcher's Pepper (I love pepper). Substituted Beef Broth for Water. Regular Paprika instead of Hungarian. Regular Oregano instead of Mexican. Corn Tortillas (ground) instead of Masa Harina. The Chili is plenty spicy. I like spicy food but this Chili was borderline too hot. The consistency is too thick. Perhaps I should have used less or no Masa. The meat came out too beefy. I used Chuck Steak. Maybe it could have been browned longer. I followed the directions but 8lbs is a lot of meat. It probably would have been better had the meat been cooked longer. The meat is very tender maybe the beef broth was overkill. The Chili was fun to make and everything seemed to go according to the recipe. I can't understand why it tastes...So...Blah. I mean it tastes like hot beef not chili. That is my best attempt at describing the taste. If by reading the other reviews you are inclined to make this Chili consider the following: A) Try half the amount of Ground Red Chili Peppers. You can always add the rest later. B) Make sure the meat is good and brown as stated in the recipe. C) Use half or totally eliminate Masa.",
