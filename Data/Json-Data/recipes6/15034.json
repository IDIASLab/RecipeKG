For my medium-sized machine I resize the recipe to make 7.3 servings (though I then actually make 12 rolls out of the dough. The original recipe makes rolls that are too big for my liking.) The pureed squash is added along with the other liquids at the bottom of the bread pan. Remember to use bread machine yeast (\"instant\" yeast) instead of active dry yeast. The recipe also seems to work very well with other vegetables. I have tried butternut squash carrot and beetroot (which makes great \"Red Nose Day\" rolls!)",

Just as they come out of the oven, if you rub a stick of butter over the tops of them, it keeps them soft and makes them just that much better. Also, substituting up to half of whole wheat flour for white gives them an added health kick without ruining the texture. One more note--this is a bread that you can make ahead of time. Stick dough balls in a greased casserole dish, seran wrap, freezer bag, then thaw and bake whenever you want! ",

                "reviewBody": "I cut this recipe in half. Because I did not have winter squash on hand, I used Trader Joe's organic canned pumpkin. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the slightly-cooled scalded milk, warm water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the cooked squash, melted butter, and all the dry ingredients. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook, almost another full cup. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, adding more flour when the dough would stick to the bottom of the mixer bowl (which it did because the dough was rather sticky). I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was absolutely perfect. Good sized dinner rolls that were soft, fluffy and absolutely wonderful. What a fantastic recipe and really, the pumpkin adds a pretty color and adds a little something to the roll that's really fantastic. I think this would make a great sweet roll dough. NOTE: Watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time. HALF RECIPE for me was exactly 12 rolls.",

I think these would be better with a little more grit so if I make them again I'll use half wheat flour next time. I might also toy with using butter instead of crisco. I followed the recipe exactly this time except that I cut back the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and they still seemed plenty sweet to me. Sweet moist and HUGE. The other reviewers weren't kidding. I should have halved the recipe!",
