However I always put my tapioca pearls in my blender first and pulverize them so they don't take so long to cook. Instead of using boiling water I let the tapioca soften in cold water add all the remaining ingredients and then bring to a boil. I also cook these on the stove top simply because I don't plan ahead far enough to use the slow cooker. If I did I think cooking time would be far less if you broke up the tapioca pearls. Mine thickened up easily.",
