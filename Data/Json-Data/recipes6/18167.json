I received many compliments on the flavor and even the color.  I'd like to pass on something I did.  I wanted an ice ring.  I filled my mold to about a 1/3 of it's capacity, then put it in the freezer.  At the same time, I took fresh strawberries,(washed and hulled) and frozen them on a plate lined with waxed paper.  I also filled a container with punch and froze it to the consistancy of slush.  When the mold was frozen, I added the strawberries and the \"slush\" to fill the mold and returned it to the freezer.  It really looked pretty. I also placed the remaining frozen strawberries in the punch to help keep it cold.   Her wedding was Valentine's day and the  strawberries in the punch was a colorful touch.\r\n\r\nOne mistake I made...I didn't make enough.  I trippled the punch and it still wasn't enough.  Many liked the punch much better than the wonderful champaign we had.\r\n\r\nEllie Russell, Jacksonville, FL \r\n",

The name caught my eye then the simple ingrediants seemed like they would blend well together. I made a batch a week early to taste- thats when I knew it was gonna work. I decided to \"doctor it up\" by replacing the O.J. with Minute Maid Blends orange passion concentrate. I used a little less lemon juice about 1 1/4 cup per gallon of water and I also added a fruit blend from Trader Joes (mango guava passion fruit orange ect.) a little extra sugar to compensate for the melting ice. It was great",

With triple the recipe and about 85 guests there were 2 cups left at the end of the 3 hour party. I bought a three tiered beverage fountain from an online retailer (think of a river in South America) for about 50 and didn't want a recipe with carbonation which would quickly be lost or citrus pulp which would clog the pump or holes in the fountain. This recipe was a TOTAL success!!! Nice flavor and the golden color of course matched the golden theme of the anniversary. I was worried about using bottled lemon juice rather than fresh but it worked fine. And the sugar seemed like a lot but with all the lemon juice it was needed. A great alternative punch to the \"standard fare\" red punch or those made with ice cream or sherbet lemon lime pop etc.. The fountain was very much a hit with the kids and no spilling as with a ladle! Tara thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",
