I hope you enjoy them as much as we do. You can make these larger or smaller; simply adjust the baking time. Keep loosely covered, and they will maintain their chewiness for several days, if they last that long.",

The only thing I did different was add WAY less salt (about half a teaspoon) and I could really taste the salt in the finished product but it was just right. I also added white chocolate chips and cooked for 16 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet with parchment paper before removing and placing on a cooling rack. Next time I will add a little more cinnamon and I think they would be perfect!",
