I've made this about 6 times now and have found that as long as you make sure the cake batter is level with the cake pan you're using (before you put it in the oven) it'll cook to perfection with the least amount of mess. I use frozen peaches on top and fold about 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries into the cake batter. I find that frozen fruit works best; try and pick a 'sturdy' fruit for the top (tried frozen strawberries once and they went to virtual mush).I triple wrap my pan with aluminum foil and put it on a cookie sheet for extra spillage. I have an old school springform pan that doesn't have the buckles which seems to work better than a regular springform pan. Be very careful when lifting off the aluminum foil from the pan; the caramel sauce is very hot! This is totally a keeper! Thanks for a scrumptuous recipe;)",

In the baking recipes I'm familiar with brown sugar is measured \"packed\" so I did that for the topping here too - that gave a little too much to the (heavenly) sauce next time I'll just measure the two cups out - chalk that up to the inexperienced baker. I also didn't bother to measure the peaches just sliced and arranged them until the pan was full which seemed to work wonderfully. Not having the deep 10\" pan I used an 8x11 which JUST BARELY held the cake and still leaked some sauce in the oven: a 9x13 should work great next time. The 8x11 needed just under an hour for bake time. Very rich satisfying impressive and simple enough to turn out - thanks very much for sharing!",
