I didn't get 1 TBSP of zest from my small orange so added a bit of natural orange extract to the batter to bump up the orange flavor. I used more apricots so also added an extra splash of o.juice. My loaf needed 50 minutes in the oven. As an alternative next time I will increase the butter by 2-3 TBSP to keep it moist maybe add some Cointreau to the dried fruit and o.j. mixture possibly increase the sugar slightly to make it more of a cake rather than a loaf",
