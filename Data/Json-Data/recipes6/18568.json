I was a bit troubled about the lengthy cooking time and knew it could be accomplished in the microwave in a fraction of the time.  These settings and times will differ from microwave to microwave, but I cooked the tomalito, covered, for 7 min. at 30% power and then 4 min. at full power.  It came out awesome after only 11 minutes.  Experiment, because this stellar recipe warrants being made often!  I originally rated this in June 2004 but wanted to make sure new viewers saw my microwave directions because they are soooo easy.",

I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup substituted butter for the margarine and used previous reviewers' suggestions for microwaving (7 min. at 30% 4 min. at 100%). Cutting down the sugar lets us use it as a base for toppings (sliced jalapenos or salsa or seasoned meat) or even as a filling for tacos/burritos without being too sweet. But when we want this for dessert I bump it up to the 1/3 cup of sugar and voila! Perfection. Thanks for the great recipe!

According to the Chevy's cookbook, you should cover the pan tightly with foil, place in a larger roasting pan, pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach 3/4\" depth, and cook their Sweet Corn Tomalito in a 250 degree oven until a thermometer reads 175 degrees F (I assume when placed in the center of the casserole).  For a 13\"x9\"x2\" pan of corn tomalito, this should take 1 1/2 - 2 hours, but it would probably take much less for an 8\"x8\" pan, I would guess 60-90 minutes.  Cooking over a pot of boiling water seems precarious, and I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave, so this is the method I'm going to use.",

When done baking to thicken it up a little more I then put it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and microwaved it a tad. It appeared more like what I thought it should but then it got really \"dry.\" The original directions really need to make this clear on how to cook this!
