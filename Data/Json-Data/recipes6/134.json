I made these when it was still a personal recipe and here is my review: Occasional Cooker has a great recipe here! I did change the method by baking my wings in the oven first without the sauce (this can even be done a day or two in advance) and then grilling them using the sauce as a basting/dipping sauce. Turned out great!! I used a product called Thai Chili Garlic Paste which is really hot so I did cut back on the amount and just added it to taste. I also used fresh ginger (3 times as much) for the dried. Hubs and I really enjoyed these and didn t find them to be too sweet at all. Thank you Occasional Cooker! This will be repeated for sure!!",

I also dialed down the chile sauce for my kids, but if it were for just me and my husband I would have added exactly what was indicated in the recipe.  It helps if you turn up your oven the last 10 minutes of cooking to \"crisp\" up the skin.",

If using drumsticks & thigh's use a baking sheet a little deeper to collect the juice run off. Make sure you brush the sauce over chicken every 15min like the recipe calls for and it will caramelize perfectly! I also used pureed ginger instead of fresh & it also gave great flavour. This recipe would also work good on the BBQ. This is a keeper!",
