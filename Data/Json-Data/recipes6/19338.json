I used 1 can roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and one can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup, added an onion and can of drained mushrooms and put it all in my crock pot for 10 hours.  It smelled great and when I went to take the meat out of the pot, it actually fell apart.  I served it over garlic mashed potatoes drizzled with the mushrooms and onions.  I agree that the gravy was very thin, but I don't like thick gravy, so it was fine.  I could have thickened it.  My husband and house guest loved it and even my 2 year olds ate it up.  So easy and inexpensive to make.  I'll definitely make it again!",
