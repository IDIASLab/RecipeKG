I followed the recipe exactly, except I needed 2 or 3 more mins. of baking time.  Could have been because it was an extremely humid day.  Save yourself some time and buy the already shelled  pistachios.  It took me 45 MINUTES to shell the cup and a half I needed.  I then determined that the shells weighed the same as the nuts so when it's all said and done, you aren't saving a great deal by buying the ones in shells.  I bought unsalted pistachios, I think next time I would buy the lightly salted ones, just to give them a bit more flavor.  Also, one pkg. of white chocolate chips didn't quite make 2 cups, more like 1-3/4 cups, but it tasted fine.  I used a small ice cream scoop and got exactly 7 dozen cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
