I did change a few things though: I reduced the amount of flour to 2 1/4 cup (dough was not as crumbly) and since I didn't have a lemon for zest I used 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. I also added a drop of red food coloring to the cookie dough to turn them pink. I only chilled the dough for about 2hrs rolled them into balls and covered them in the red sugar and baked them for 8min. My fiancee loved them and he's not really a cherry person. I think these are going into my tins at Christmas!! Thank you so much for sharing this!:)",
