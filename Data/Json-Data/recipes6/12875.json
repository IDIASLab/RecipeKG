My sister made cookies like these when I was little, but she doesn't remember making them anymore and I could never get the recpie from her. These are almost exactly them.... \r\n\r\nI made these with milk chocolate chips (compliments the banana very well), reduced the baking powder to 1 1/4 tsp, and used 3 (about 1 and 1/4 cups mashed) very ripe but NOT brown bananas... I couldn't wait for them to ripen that much ;) The banana flavor is delicate, but definitely there.... I think those who want a more banana-y flavor may want to try replacing some of the vanilla with banana extract. The cookies do have a slightly \"muffin-y\" texture to them... but don't let that put you off of trying them. I've never had muffins as good as these cookies.  (also, I baked these on parchment paper, and found they rounded themselves out reasonably well - better than it sounds like they did for other with just an ungreased pan)",

They are still coming out of the oven batch after batch and my 5 year old son is eating them up! He's had 2 so far and loves them. These are nice puffy cookies that would be GREAT with a cuppa tea. I will be using semi sweet chocolate chips next time I make these because I love the two flavours together and carob just doesn't do it for me.;) I was trying to be healthy about baking.
