I tasted it before baking and added a cup of milk and another egg to tone down the sweetness and was still very sweet, but still very good. I think I will skip the sugar next time since there is plenty of sugar in the condensed milk.  I used leftover ends and pieces of 4 or 5 different loaves of bread, added cranberries, used shredded coconut, subbed vanilla extract and may add pineapples next time also.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

When I realized I only had one can of coconut milk (not condensed milk as one reviewer said--no wonder hers came out too sweet!), so I substituted a cup or so of heavy cream for the second can of coconut milk.  I also didn't have coconut extract, so I used a tsp or so of vanilla extract.  I also didn't have nutmeg, so I used allspice.  My pet peeve on recipe review sites is when someone changes 12 things and then gives the recipe a bad rap.  I'm here to say that this one is delicious and hard to mess up even when you are ingredient-challenged!  I used my convection oven at 300 degrees, and it took about 35 minutes.",
