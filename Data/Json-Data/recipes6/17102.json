My roommate tried them and ssaid \"Forget the pie lets make cookies!\" I also used Adams Extract Vanilla claiming to be 2x the strength (Although I can't tell the difference I just use it because it's clear and I like the top of my french silk pie to be bright white.) Why this as a pie crust? French silk pie has a sweet filling. I added sugar and vanilla to the cream on top and that made a plain crust stand out like a sore thumb! I needed a sweet crust so I went looking and coulsn't find anything that went well with the pie then it hit me forget the self rising flour and use a sugar cookie recipie! It works out great but it is too sweet for a lot of people. The only other thing I changed was I used butter instead of shortening and added about 1/2 Tbsp of light corn syrup (Just because I like it a little sweeter:) Overall it is great. This recipie makes nice soft fluffy melt in your mouth cookies just the way I like them! Thanks Melissa Heath for submitting it",

My husband loved these even more than our daughter...who has an insatiable sweet tooth. I didn't have butter flavored crisco but added some butter flavoring and they were great. just a side note...If you don't want to buy self rising flour just for this recipe you can substitute regular flour. For every cup of regular flour just add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder. It is the same as self rising.",

After we put them on the cookie sheets he helped me press them with a sugar-coated glass bottom. We decorated them for our family's July 4th celebration with Sugar Cookie Frosting colored red and blue. They were soft and perfectly crispy around the edges. Thanks!! We'll be using this one again!",

Maybe that's where I went wrong. Anyways it doesn't say to chill the dough before cutting into shapes but mine was way too sticky and soft. I chilled for a few hours but it was still sticky and soft. I ended up making drop cookies which were good but they tasted kind of like the Simple White Cake recipe that is also on this website. I love that recipe but these cookies just weren't what i was looking for. I might try again with Shortening though.",

Today I made these and they are beautiful!! I halved the recipe in case I screwed them up I wouldn't have wasted to much. I worked slowly at first and added more flour to my ball of dough as it got too sticky to roll out. Once I pressed them out with the cookie cutters I transfered them from the counter to the pan with a spatula so they wouldn't tear in my hand. I cooked about 7 minutes and let them continue cooking on the hot pan once they were taken out as another reviewer suggested. I used regular crisco (because that's waht I had) and they tasted just fine. I am so grateful for this easy and wonderful recipe!!",
