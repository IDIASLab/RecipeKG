In my opinion, the best way to handle the tomatoes is to dice them and remove the seeds, then put them in a food processor--pulse until they are in small pieces but not liquified. Then I followed the recipe (put them in a colander, salt, rinse; let them drain). I also suggest cutting the nutmeg back to half a teaspoon. I also added an extra egg since I am at a high altitude (over 5,000 ft.) I like the cake with a cream cheese icing, but my husband likes it plain. One kind of funny thing about this cake is that it tastes better than it smells or looks!",

It's an easy to throw together cake(I didn't salt or drain the chopped tomatoes...too lazy and my Roma's aren't very juicy to start with). I topped it off with a cream cheese frosting so whats not to like?. I'm sure you can play around with lots of spices to your own taste. I think I'll be making this cake quite often during the next couple of weeks while the garden winds down. Might even try a chocolate version? Give it try if for no other reason than to use up some of those many green tomatoes!",

Also - I have tried it with the cream cheese frosting & without.. I prefer without, it's just too good all on it's own!  YUMMY - one is baking now & the house smells so good!  I can't wait for later! **as a side note - I have since tried this in a bundt, and had good success.  I baked longer & at 330, and had no problem with a soft center as previous reviews stated.  Also drizzled the rum cream-cheese glaze from another recipe - YUM!**",
