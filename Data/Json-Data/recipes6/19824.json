                "reviewBody": "My 1 year old son and I are eating this right now. Delicious! He keeps asking for more and I can't deny him because I want more too.:) I inherited a bag of store-brand raisin bran from someone who was moving away but there was a hole in it so it was stale. I searched online for a recipe to use it up and landed here since it seemed easy and I had all the ingredients. It is easy and it tastes great! Especially when I took the advice of the other reviewers: I added 1 Tbsp of unsalted butter 1 tsp of cinnamon and a handful of extra raisins. Since this off-brand cereal had really large flakes I crushed the cereal a bit in a bowl before measuring it out. Then I dumped everything into my bread maker selected white bread and let it do its thing. The bread came out moist and soft and tasting like cinnamon raisin bread you buy at the store only fresher since it was just baked. So good when eaten still warm with a spread of butter. Can't wait to try it as toast. I'll definitely make this again even if I don't have any stale raisin bran cereal.:) PS in my bread maker this came out as a 2 pound loaf in size even though I didn't double the recipe. Keep an eye on yours if your breads tend to rise too much and touch the lid. ----- EDIT: My family and I ate nearly the whole loaf the day it was made. The next morning we made toast with it and were disappointed. Nice texture but bland. Needs toppings to taste good. At least it tastes good fresh! I'll still make it again.",
