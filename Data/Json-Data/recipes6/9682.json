Because of the lockdown, I don\u2019t have bread flour and so have had to experiment with what I\u2019ve had on hand. The first time I used 30% spelt flour and 70% einkorn. It was a nice loaf! The second time I used half einkorn, half all-purpose flour. It was even better! I can\u2019t wait till I get some bread flour, as I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be even better yet. I have used a combination of oats and seeds (sesame, poppy) to cover the bottom and top of the bread. Also, since I\u2019m out of parchment, I have been lining the slow cooker with aluminum foil, and it works totally fine. I broil at the end as suggested. Thank you for an amazing recipe!",

I poked around on the internet some and found you have to add sugar to get the yeast to activate.  My yeast appeared to be dead, but I completed the recipe anyway.  I got a raw-looking (but not actually raw inside) outcome that tasted all right but was not risen.  I blamed the yeast.\n\nThe next day I got some other yeast which I tried to activate with water, per this recipe.  Nothing happened.  Then I tried again using sugar, and I got a big froth.  Yay.  Maybe my loaf will rise!\n\nNo.  One hour in an airtight container and there was really no perceptible rise.  The air in the container was noticeably warm, though, so I could tell something chemical was trying to happen.  \n\nKneaded and then put in slow cooker.  2 hours later I had a loaf nearly identical to the one from the prior day.\n\nTLDR:  1.  Use sugar in step one of the recipe.  2.  If you don't mind a barely-risen doorstop for texture and size, this recipe is OK.  The flavor is fine.",
