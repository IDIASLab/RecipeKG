This will be replacing my nice, but boring old standard recipe. I followed to the letter however, must admit to using a black cherry/cranberry juice blend I found. My only, albeit slight, issue with this recipe is it was a tad 'loose' so I would reduce the juice accordingly next time to allow the sauce to gel a bit thicker. Thank you so much for sharing this gem!",

I let the sauce cook down before removing from the heat; and I left the orange quarters but removed before serving. I buy ground korintje cinnamon in bulk so I used that rather than a cinnamon stick. Absolutely delicious (and let me throw in a plug for buying cinnamon other than what one picks up in the grocery store. you will not believe the difference in the flavor!)",

I can't do sugar being diabetic so used \"diet\" cranberry juice and substituted agave syrup for the brown sugar (not sure how much just a really good squeeze). I prefer things to be more tart than sweet so this was perfect. I also didn't measure exactly 6 oz. of cherries but sort of estimated since I had no scale and just went by the approximate weight of what I bought in bulk today. I ate some too so who knows if exactly 6 ounces wound up in there LOL! It came out wonderfully and my roommate who doesn't even like cranberry said it smelled so good that she had to try it...and she loved it! It was a little juicy but thickened up nicely as it cooled.",

One note of caution though: I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and added a bit of cornstarch and water to the recipe which made it jell to the consistency I wanted.
