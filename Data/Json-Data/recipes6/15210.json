                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. Using slow cooker at holidays frees up oven space & your attention span, e.g., one less item to stir/worry about.  Used canned sweet potatoes/yams, left out nuts, cut back on butter a little.  Everyone enjoyed, even children.  Have also made a few days ahead & either reheated in micro or bought to friends as a side dish.  If anything, reheating a few days late enhances flavor.  Orange juice gives a nice clean undertone flavor to a very simple, easy dish.  Unless you're a purist or hate the taste of canned veggies, use the canned yams/potatoes. I've used fresh baked & canned.  The slight difference the fresh baked makes is not worth the extra time,effort or trouble in my opinion & I'm a bit biased towards using fresh items.",

The only thing I would alter is the amount of butter; it seemed to be a tad to buttery for my taste. Thanks for the recipe!",

I only added 1/2 the oj and then added about 1 tsp vanilla. For the topping I subsituted quick oats for the pecans. I layered as other posters said and then the last 30 minutes of cooking added mini marshmellows. So yummy!! Also I cooked on high for 1 1/2 hrs and then on low for an additional 2 hrs.",

This recipe seems to be it - it was VERY delicious. I have a very very large Westbend slow cooker so I doubled the topping as one batch wouldn't have reached all potatoes as they spread out (it was worth it every bite came with the nice sweet topping). I also used the 2T of butter for the potatoes and the topping (silly me I didn't even notice the teaspoon mistake) skipped the pecans and made it with fresh potatoes although with the review below I am tempted to try canned (yuck? I'm VERY anti-canned fruits/veggies they should be banned). Make this with confidence it's a guaranteed hit.",
