I particularly liked the fact that, though the recipe calls for real butter, you didn't have to refrigerate the dough before baking.  I adapted the recipe to a half batch with no problems.  The only thing I found I had to do differently was modify the baking time a bit:  I cooked them for about 11 minutes on a parchment paper-lined sheet, and they turned out beautifully.  My entire family loved these cookies, and I will definitely make them again.  Thanks so much, Arlene! :)",

They did not care for the flavor of butterscotch (wuzzies!) so next time I'll use chocolate chip.  I might add some peanuts too.. these would have been great using them.  Thanks for sharing, Arlene",
