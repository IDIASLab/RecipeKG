A little on the interesting side - it was like a mix between cake and brownies - but that could have been due to not frosting it. I garnished it with confectioner's sugar instead of frosting as that is what I had on hand. Next time I think it would be good with a simple orange glaze (reduction of confectioner's sugar and OJ - really easy) or with icing/frosting. Definitely tasted like chocolate syrup!",
