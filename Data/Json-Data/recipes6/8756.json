Probably used more cheddar than the recipe called for, and topped it with bread crumbs as well.  Initially I was afraid the spaghetti would get dried out, but was pleasantly surprised to serve an incredibly creamy, yummy and FILLING main dish.  Talk about comfort food!  This was very tasty and very creamy, but not sickening like an alfredo sauce.  My husband and son liked it a lot as well.  Good recipe, Mrs. Leonard!",

The changes I made for my taste: I saut\u00e9ed sliced mushrooms and garlic with the onions in real butter. I also mixed in a little bit of sliced fresh spinach and oregano as well as mixing a little bit of breadcrumbs with the cheese on top before putting it in the oven.  I doubled the recipe because I was cooking for a few more people.  It was so tasty! I have made this recipe before with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.",
