But  it's super easy to  toast / bake raw flour and it also adds a nice flavor dimension. The fastest is to put 1 cup in a medium size fry pan and stir in medium heat for 5-6 minutes. The flour changes color slightly and you can smell the nuttiness . Raw flour is probably not one of the first things that comes to mind in regard to food safety but it can be just as dangerous as raw eggs. \nSo as to changes... less salt and by all means experiment with other flavor chips. Personally I like using butterscotch  and chocolate chips.",
