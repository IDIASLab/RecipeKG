I went back to check and I followed all the instructions.  My husband says he prefers the casserole version as he is not a big soup fan.  A big plus was that I had enough to feed an army. I made it during a historic snow and ice storm in Texas and it fed 5 of us with leftovers for 2 more full meals.  That will help us stretch until we are able to get more groceries in town.",
