I used baby bella (cremini) mushrooms, and garnished with some chopped parsley for a pop of color. And  I cooked the meatballs on a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet just to make clean-up easier.  This turned out very, very well!  The only thing that I\u2019ll do differently in the future is add a bit of minced garlic to the meatballs and cut the Worcestershire back to 2 tablespoons, but that\u2019s personal taste preference.  I\u2019ll also double the meatballs, cook them, put in a zip lock bag, and into the freezer.  Then all I\u2019ll have to do is make the sauce, add the meatballs, cook the noodles, and this will be a quick-and-easy weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s comfort food at its finest!",

The sauce was way too light in color before I even added the sour cream. As always, I tasted it first then added just a touch of kitchen bouquet. Really added to the flavor and the color.  For my broth I used 2 beef  bouillon  cubes to one cup of water, as I don\u2019t keep broth on hand. I also added Lowery\u2019s California blend garlic salt with parsley  when I saut\u00e9ed the mushrooms. I would also make more sauce the next time around, as I felt that this wasn\u2019t quite enough.\nAll in all I really like this recipe. I will be making it again. Thank you.",
