I used sesame oil and Jasmine rice.  I also drizzled lime juice over the rice after it was finished.  I think the cilantro and lime juice are essential.  The only thing I will do differently next time is try it with two eggs instead of one.  One egg doesn't seem too noticeable in the final dish and I think two will make it more like authentic fried rice.",

The smell when cooking is great: the scent of the jasmine combined with onions and garlic! mmmm... I have some suggestions though: (1) If you're using dried cilantro use more like a teaspoon. Dried cilantro is more dense and powerful than fresh and this recipe calls for a tablespoon of fresh. (I made the mistake of using a tablespoon of dried once and that was way too much.) (2) The cucumbers don't add anything to (and I think even detract from) the flavor; I've skipped adding them after the first time I cooked this. (3) The lime flavor however does add something. It goes well especially with the crab.",
