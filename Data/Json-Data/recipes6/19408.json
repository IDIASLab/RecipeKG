I would go so far as to say that EVERYONE who ate this cookie LOVED IT. I followed the measurements posted in the review by Erin H. on June 9 09...and it was spot on!THESE WERE GREAT!! I will use this recipe from now on. In total 9 different people ate these and each one raved about it. A friend and her mom actually called me on the phone after they were in the car eating the cookies...they called to rave and say how good they were! As with all of us out here in \"all recipe\" land I love when people love my cooking/baking! Try this recipe and you will not be disappointed. I made the cookies regular size (1\"-1.5\" balls) and baked them at 350. The recipe temperature & time is for large cookies so if you want regular size cookies bake at 350 for about 8-9 minutes. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!",
