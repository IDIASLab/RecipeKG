I'm a 'throw it in and see how it turns out' kind of cook, so please adjust the recipe to fit your own tastes.

The sugar caramalized beautifully and the kids said they tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. Due to fruit allergies I had to eliminate the apples and kiwi but it was still wonderful just with the berries and bananas. If you have any leftover chips use them as a base and top with caramel swirl icecream caramel sauce chocolate whipped cream and a few chocolate curls. Makes a really pretty presentation!

And no matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine I baked the chips vs. frying to keep this a little healthier and lower in fat. So for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy sweet and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!",

When we were in the car we heard Boys Like Girls but I personally like boys. Then we heard Taylor Swift and Doug (the brother previously mentioned) is in love with Taylor Swift. I mean not a celebrity crush. He is convinced he will marry her. Don't be surprised if the next headline is \"Taylor Swift engaged to.... Doug?\" He freaked out and started singing along to the song. He almost crashed the car! He's not the best at driving stick shift but he thinks he is... SEW we just play along. We bought some stuff to make drink concoctions that can't be said because they are secret but they were good!!! Then we got home. We decided to play truth or dare and we did some pretty nasty dares. I had to lick the floor! (Yes we're 5 years old.) THEN Laura had this great idea to make these chips! We went on Google and searched: Mexican cinnamon sugar tortilla chips. Then we decided we didn't need the Mexican part so we took that out. And guess what popped up? This recipe! We just made them as they were directed (the baked version) We had to make some revisions though. We put the tortilla triangles in a bowl and covered them with Pam (the cooking spray) We tossed them around with some cinnamon sugar and baked 'em. Then we plated them with some whipped cream. They were very good though the time stated was incorrect. Awesome!!!",
