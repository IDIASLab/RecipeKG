Topped with a chilled can of cherry pie filling in winter but in the spring topped with fresh strawberry topping: 1 qt fresh strawberries washed and hulled. Puree half of the berries in food processer with one cup sugar then stir in the other half and chill. This is a keeper. Thank you so much for this recipe.",
