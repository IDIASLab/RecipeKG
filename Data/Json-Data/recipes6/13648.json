Just before I pureed it I had decided that the next time I made it I would probably cut back on the chicken both because it seemed a little \"watery\".  But once I pureed it, (one cup at a time so it didn't explode out of the blender!) it was a rich and creamy and wonderful soup.  That COMPLETELY changed the soup...for the better.  I'm not a fan of spicy hot, but I did enjoy the andouille in this recipe, it isn't too spicy.  I think next time I'm going to try a breakfast sausage though, just to try it a different way.",

Not sure what 1.5 pounds of pumpkin is, but I used 4 cups and it had great flavor.  No praline liqueur, but spiced rum added a great scent and flavor.  Did cut back on the stock to only 4 cups (we like our soup thick) and used 8oz. evap. milk in place of the heavy cream.  Used another reviewer's suggestion of topping with sour cream and loved it, though hubby preferred without.  We found the flavor to be even better the next day.  This was AWESOME soup and a recipe that I will definitely make again!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm rating this 2 stars because made as it is posted it somehow turned out all wrong for me. More of a thin broth with no pumpkin flavour texture or colour. I ended up adding a lot more pumpkin in. It was homegrown roasted pumpkin which I strained pureed then added instead of letting it cook in the soup. This made it a very quick soup as I did not have to simmer for 45 min. I doubled the thyme and added a bit of rosemary. Used 3/4 cup 1% instead of the cream left out the butter and added salt. I didn't have praline liquer so I added a touch of maple extract. Not a bad thing! Overall I was a bit worried I hadn't done enough to \"save\" the soup but everyone loved it! We really enjoyed the chunks of sausage. Definitely excited to eat the leftovers and will be making it again seasonally. If you fiddle with the levels you can't go wrong with this recipe. Thanks MARBALET:)",
