I think it could use a little more coconut milk and peanut butter (we like more sauce to go with the rice) and less/no lemon juice (too sour for our taste), and might not need the brown sugar if the peanut butter contains sugar.  I seasoned the chicken pieces with some salt and pepper, garlic powder, ginger paste, and corn starch (to make it more tender) before browning in coconut oil.  A Thai relative taught me to saut\u00e9s the curry paste in coconut cream (the top/cream portion of the coconut milk) with ginger slices for a minute to bring out maximum flavor before adding the other ingredients.  I also added more veggies in the curry.  Overall a great recipe\u2014Thank you!",
