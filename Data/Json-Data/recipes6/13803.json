However I had so many left over bread cubes from another recipe that I was looking to use them up and  I decided to take a chance and try this.  It's pretty good although I think the recipe instructions are a bit poorly written in some parts.  In the beginning, I wasn't sure if I was doing this right.  In any case, this has a nice, chocolately flavor and is not too sweet (which I liked).  It is definitely easy and was a good way to get rid of some leftover bread.  I prefer it warm so I after it had baked and cooled, I just pop the portions in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes very nice.  All in all, this was pretty good!",
