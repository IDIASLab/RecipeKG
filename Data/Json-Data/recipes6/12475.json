With addition of the Brazil nuts the batter became very crumbly so I used a small melon ball scooper and packed the batter into the scooper and placed the balls on a Silpat mat. The cookies were tasty - very sweet nutty orangy flavor. I can best describe my reaction as ambivalent - they were kind of good but maybe I'll make them again and maybe not. If I make them again I would reduce the sugar by 2-3 TBspoons.",

The melon baller worked pretty well but i cut the cooking time to 11min. Yummy! People loved them and it was nice to give them a healthier cookie for a change. Plus one that I can eat (I'm a low carber) Next time I make I'll toast the chopped nuts just a bit before adding them.",

It wasn't a soft macaroon-like cookie I thought it would be as the oats were a little tough still but I didn't leave them in the fridge over nigh either - only for 6 hours.
