I almost didn't take them b/c I was afraid too many people wouldn't like the pineapple or coconut but then figured oh well I made them so take them and I thought they were good. Of all the items I've made from this site over the years this one got more positive results than any other. I had so many requests for the recipe and the men loved it!!! One told me to go into business and sell these cookies. Even my kids loved the crumbs that were left over so I guess I'll be making them again. Not a difficult recipe and so worth the time.",
