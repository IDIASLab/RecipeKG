One suggestion I have for making this recipe is make sure your dropping the batter in the oil in the \"level tablespoon\" size and no larger...otherwise, you've got a yummy looking raw-in-the-middle dough ball.  The tablespoon amount of batter gives you a \"doughnut hole\" sized doughnut.  Also, drain them on a paper bag instead of papertowel...it tends to keep them crisper since the papertowel creates a \"steaming\" effect.  Cheers!",

These are addictive little suckers. Between the three of us, we made quick work of these spiced donut holes. The kids keep talking about them and how unbelievably good they are--HUGE hit here. Next time I make these, I'd like to try another submitter's idea and try pumpkin puree in place of the applesauce. I bet that would be AWESOME. NOTE: Using one of those spring loaded cookie dough scoops to make uniform balls and to drop into the hot oil works really well. Try that. Much easier than trying to manuver a tablespoon and a spoon.",

My husband has made me promise not to make them again soon because he couldn't stop popping them! I followed recipe and advice from reviews using pumpkin instead of applesauce but also added finely chopped apple to the batter. I used a candy thermometer with a pan on the stove which seemed to work best below 375 degrees- more like 325-355. Also small teaspoons of dough instead of larger sized doughnuts allowed the centers to cook better for me. This recipe wil be used often in the fall particularly while DH is working and the kids can get some! Thanks for posting it for us!",

I had to go look for a recipe to make the sauce and it had sugar there thus the extra sugar burnt in the frier and I had to start all over. 2)Sugar is not in the dry ingredients category. I didn't read through the instructions carefully and added the sugar with the dry stuff and so had nothing to beat the eggs with thus the fluff never came. Still hard to understand how friers work. Had it on the right temperature and all but the outsides started browning while the insides were still wet. Plus the doughnuts soaked up too much oil. I read that adding half a teaspoon of vinger (carefully) to the hot oil will help prevent that. Will try it next time. BUT this recipe found its way to our tummies hearts and the recipe box. Will make it again and again!",
