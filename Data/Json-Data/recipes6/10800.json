I added twice the amount of white chocolate to the cake (not the sauce) added a crushed oreo cookie crust (1/3 cup butter and 2/3 oreo cookie bag) and topped it with strawberries when serving. The most important tip is not to put the springform inside the steam bath but instead to place the steam bath on the rack underneath the cheesecake when baking.",

I will definitely make it again.\n\nI didn't have a 10\" springform, so I used a 7\" and an 8\".  The cake ended up a little thinner, but not by much.  (2 7\" pans would have the same area as one 10\" pan.  Sorry about the numbers... I majored in math in university and I can't help it.)\n\nI wanted to transfer the cake to a platter for serving, so I added a standard chocolate cookie crumb crust (3/4c crumbs and 1/4c butter, pressed into pan and baked at 350 for 10 min) to make the transfer easier.  Also, I took everyone's advice and doubled up the white chocolate in the cheesecake batter.  Everything turned out wonderfully.  \n\nBut I'm not sure the cheesecake needed the extra chocolate.  That's because it's the white chocolate brandy sauce that really makes the cake pop.  To quote my wife, \"you could pour the sauce on cardboard and it would taste great.\"  I'd stick with cheesecake though.\n\nFor baking, I put a pan of water on the rack under the springform pans.  The cheesecakes did crack a little, but I think it may be because I overbaked them slightly.\n\nI also added a raspberry sauce (5 oz frozen raspberries, 1 tsp corn starch, 1/4c water, 1/2 tbsp sugar, boil 5 min, strain) for garnish, which I think was a good idea to add some colour to an otherwise very pale dessert.  I served the dessert plated and garnished each slice with a dollop of whipped cream and a raspberry.",

The first time I made this I used chocolate from the bulk bin and it was an awful tasting cheesecake. I made it for Christmas this year with good quality white chocolate and took it to a family gathering. Everybody loved it and  wanted the recipe. It really was amazingly good. I had added an oreo cookie crust, about 20 oreo cookies crushed and pressed into the pan. They do not need sugar or butter and hold together nicely. I also changed the sauce and added about 3/4 cup Butter Ripple cream liquor instead of the brandy. It was phenomenal. When I served it, both the sauce and the cheesecake had been sitting in the frige and the sauce was nicely thickend. The recipe for the sauce made quite a large amount of sauce and I may try cutting that in half next time I make it. I sprinkled raspberries and blackberries on the cake to serve and it was a huge hit. I will be making this again and again.",

We didn't have any brandy on hand so I used a shot of amaretto rum and it worked very well. I would definitely make this again. I don't remember if this was in the recipe but cheesecakes taste better once they've set up overnight in the fridge. Also the sauce would probably be less runny if it is refrigerated and then poured over the cake in the morning. If I were to make it again I would make it in the morning or a day in advance.",

(4.5oz of milk chocolate 2tbsp dark corn syrup 1/2 cup of whipping cream. mix together on low heat until chocolate is melted drizzle over cakes.)",
