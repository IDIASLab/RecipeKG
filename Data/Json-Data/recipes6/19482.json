                "reviewBody": "I have made several recipes like this. Here's a few things to note. #1. When it cools, it gets hard. Like chewy caramels. Reheat it. #2. The longer you boil it, the THICKER and, later, CHEWIER it will get. You'll know when it has reached the point where it is no longer just a bunch of stuff in a pot and has become a sauce, because the color changes and the entire texture of the mixture changes abruptly. #3. This mixture grows in volume to about 6 times or more what you originally put in there. Use a HUGE pot and don't walk away from it. If it's getting too high, remove from heat, stir it down, reduce heat, and put it back. #4. The baking soda doesn't make a \"bitter\" taste. Burning the vanilla does. Remove from heat, and stir it until it doesn't bubble anymore, then stir in the vanilla. That \"bitter\" flavor is what happens when you burn vanilla, in ANY recipe. I hope these tips help someone; this is a fabulous syrup/sauce/caramel ice cream topping/cheesecake topping/whatever you want. Thanks for the recipe & the excuse to make another version of this totally sinful sauce!",

It's very similar and doesn't cost nearly as much to make as they were charging at the market ($7 for a little tub!) I am going to make & bottle this up for my neighbor's for Christmas present, along with pancake mix. Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe!!!----2nd Review: K, I made this a 2nd time & purposely omitted the baking soda. It's sooo much better. It doesn't have a bitter, baking soda taste like the first batch & it's a pretty, white color. It does have to cook a little longer & thickens up upon sitting on a heating pad off the stove. I like it even better the 2nd way.",

I made it on a day when I had too many pots on the stove so I cooked it on very low.  The phone rang, people came to the door ... in general I was *very* distracted the entire time.  I kept the burner on low until the butter melted, stirring occasionally, then bumped it up to 2, then 3.  It foamed but I didn't realize that was probably \"boil\".  I actually turned it off when the interruptions got too much.  When I came back, I thought for sure it would be ruined but it was perfect!  So if you are worried about it boiling over or burning or not being able to stir it as often, try cooking it on very low.  A little more time needed but it turns out great without as much babysitting!",

Boil for 3 minutes, remove from heat and add 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Stir until blended and voila, awesome syrup!  Adding the baking soda AFTER boiling really does the trick.",
