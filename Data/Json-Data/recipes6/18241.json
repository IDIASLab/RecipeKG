I was expecting something harsh but this was smooth and actually kind of sweet. I picked this over the others available because it wasn't blended. I didn't have 24 hours to wait so I warmed the water lime zest and sugar on the stove until the sugar dissolved and added the juice off the heat. I let it set while preparing the glasses and measuring the tequila and Triple Sec (instead of Grand Marnier as called for). We didn't prefer the zest in our drinks so I strained it when adding it to the alcohol. We also used sugar instead of salt on the rims. The only thing I'm left wondering is if the recipe should be for two drinks. We made a double batch and ended up with four small sized margaritas. We'll definitely make these again...",

If you are a margarita or tequila connosieur you will love these and not mind the extra work involved. If you would ever consider putting beer or frozen limeade with your tequila you will probably say these are too much trouble. If you do decide to make this delicious concotion try these tips: 1. If you are in a rush mix it in a glass bowl or cup and microwave for about 20 seconds to dissolve the sugar and bring the oil out of the zest. If you have time to wait overnight marinate in the fridge and shake occasionally. Mason jars work great for this;) 2. Unless you like drinking greenery with your margarita strain the zest out before mixing/serving. 3. You can easily reduce the tequila by half and still feel good after drinking it:) 4. You probably won't get a full four drinks out of one batch so go ahead and plan to make a double!",
