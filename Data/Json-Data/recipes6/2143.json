These, paired with grilled asparagus and a good red wine, make for an awesome meal that will have your taste buds screaming for more. When cooked right, the seasoning mixture will practically caramelize over the chops. This helps seal in the juices and gives delicious flavor. Hope you guys enjoy.",
