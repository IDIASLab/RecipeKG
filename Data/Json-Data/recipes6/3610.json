It is almost impossible to get both. Some folks will smoke at 225 for a while (45 minutes.) and then turn up the smoker to 375 (The last 15 minutes.) to finish for a crispy skin. I like a dry brine (AKA: Rub only.) chicken smoked at 325 or 350 the whole way. Use a Thermopop to test doneness. Here's another twist. How about smoked fried chicken? Smoke it first then flour it and fry it",
