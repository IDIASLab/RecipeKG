Nobody in this house likes smoky flavors, so I did omit the hickory smoked salt and the smokehouse maple seasoning.  Since there was a lot of freshly-minced garlic, I also left out the garlic powder (do you really need that???).  Yes, we enjoyed this, but not well enough to make again.  The great thing about a sloppy joe is its simplicity, and I thought the recipe author was just pulling out every spice in the cabinet; bottom line, I really didn't think that any one of them distinguished itself well enough to justify this many ingredients.  The flavor that is the most dominant is the barbecue sauce, but the rest of the ingredients in such small amounts are overpowered by the BBQ sauce IMHO.  Good, yes we enjoyed it, but Bubba, I'll be movin' on.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
