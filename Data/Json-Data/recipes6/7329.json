I did add quite a bit of crushed ice which didn t dilute the flavor it too badly used vanilla Greek yogurt and pomegranate-blueberry juice (both what I had on hand) and was quite happy with the taste. As I always do with smoothies that have oatmeal I first ground/pulverized the oats in the blender and then added the rest of the ingredients. Pretty good but it does either need frozen blueberries or ice IMO and at least for me I'll cut the cinnamon in half if I make this again.",

Only changes I made was using frozen blueberries and cutting the amount of sweetener in half and it was plenty. Not a smoothie I would make again as it was too thin for my taste and I am just not a fan of smoothies with more than a couple of Tablespoons of yogurt. However it's healthy enough to get me through the afternoon. ty",
