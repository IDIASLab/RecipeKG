These came out so good. I got about 8 dozen cookies out of the batch (I used a smallish heart-shaped cookie cutter). Not having tasted them before, the taste and texture of the cookie base itself reminded me a little of a shortbread cookie. These cookies go really well with a cup of tea, as noted in another review. The cookies are only mildly sweet. They keep their shape well while baking. They are sturdy and crunchy without being hard.  I had a slight problem with the dough sticking as I rolled it out, so I just dusted on some more flour to make it work.  I am about to make another batch right now!",

The taste is subtle with a lovely lemony finish. (I was generous with the lemon zest.) I was initially concerned about straying away from the circle shape, but my stars turned out lovely.  I could easily see one adding a nice sugar glaze if they want a more decadent flavor, but I don't think it's necessary.",

                "reviewBody": "Ok. Found this because I'm at a cousin's wedding in CA and can't find our grandmother's recipe.  Reading this brings it back.  These are a Major Family Tradition from our eastern European Jewish heritage. But, our recipe uses oil to replace butter and 1/4 cup oj and no zest or lemon, no sugar topping.  Important to brown 1/4\" edge and a darkened meaning not a bright or white center. Keep them thin and krispy.  Real sticky to roll and cut. Keep a slab of marble dusted with flour or will stck to marble and roller.  I add the fresh Polish poppy seeds fro Penzey's at the last minite to help mixing and folding.   Also refrig the dough for couple hours or overnite before rolling. It helps a lot. I make tubes and then.roll them and cut onto parallelograms and place on cookie sheet slicked with crisco.  Not too much but enough to aboid sticking. I think ours uses a full cup of sugar but they come out with a lite mild sweetness.  I break the batch of dough in half and freeze until a family event or an emergency munn cookie craving ... or my mom's birthday.  Last batch 10 days ago for her 88th.  Tip: don't forget the sugar and not a drop more than one cup of oil.  NO BuTTER. I brought my own Penzey'S seeds from Philadelphia to Venice Beach.  Rented a house so we'd have an oven today. Wedding is tomorrow.  Also brought Tastykakes just in case I forgot the recipe.  But that is why I'm here sharing with y'all.  Turning on oven now. Bye.",

Instead of egg wash and sugar on top I used sugar cookie icing from this site and added lemon extract and yellow food coloring.
