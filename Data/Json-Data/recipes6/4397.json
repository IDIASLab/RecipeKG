                "reviewBody": "I married a Moroccan who makes THE best couscous (even his sisters ask him to make couscous because his is so good).  I recommend the follow changes:  Omit the cinnamon, tumeric and curry powder.  Replace with ground ginger, paprika, a pinch or two of Ras el Hanout [Moroccan spice blend] or Garam Masala will work too, salt, and pepper to taste.  Be generous with the spices; liberally sprinkle spices over the vegetables instead of measuring.    \n\nThe greastest thing about making couscous is that the ingredients can easily be subtituted!  Add queen table squash or pumpkin.  Cabbage and garlic should definitely be on your addition list!  \n\nFor a more flavorful couscous - cook it the authentic way.  Measure couscous into a ceramic bowl and cover with hot water; then drain.  Insert a tightly fitting steamer (resembles a colander) on top of the stock pot. Pour couscous and cover with a tight fitting lid.  Remove couscous periodically (20-30 minutes) and place in a big bowl/platter and fluff the couscous - breaking up the chunky pieces.  Salt and butter the couscous to taste and return to steamer pan.  The steamed couscous tastes a lot better than boiled couscous.  \n\nNOTE: Although saffron is a little expensive, it is a staple in Moroccan cooking.  To save money - avoid buying saffron at your local chain grocery store as their spices are always costly.  Try an ethnic market (Indo/Pak) and you will see a significant price difference.",
