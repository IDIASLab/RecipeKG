The combination of onion garlic and oregano is very tasty. I left in the bread machine thru the 2nd rise then formed it into a loaf and bake in a 9X5 bread pan at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Perfect bread Tom! Thanks.",

I made the dough exactly as written except I like another reviewer substitued garlic powder for the minced garlic and I don't recommend that. I think this bread needs all the kick it can get so don't be lazy like me:-) the fresh garlic probably needs to be there. I felt the Oregano was overpowering and I will subtract at least a tbsp next time. I also think I might like to add just a bit more cayenne pepper. I used my bread machine to make the dough and then with well oiled hands I shaped the dough into small balls in a 9x9 pan to create dinner rolls allowing them to rise an additional 30 minutes. I baked them for approx 35 minutes at 350. These rose well the texture was great they make a fabulous crusty dinner roll to serve with salads or soup and again the smell was fantastic. The taste though just wasn't what I was expecting. It simply tasted like a fresh homemade french bread roll with a tiny bit of spiciness. Now you must know that I made these for my Argentine husband who is standing behind me as I type this insisting that I tell you HE loved them and wants me to make them again. He says and I quote; \"they're delicious\". He's the best husband in the whole world so of course I will make them for him again:-) Thank you for the recipe Tom and Diego Thanks you too!",
