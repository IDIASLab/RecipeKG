I only had individual servings of Mac and cheese so used 3 of them. Had left over peas and carrots so used them and a can of corn, drained. No diced tomatoes so I used a can of hot ro tel. My husband is a meat and potatoes man and generally doesn't like dishes like this, but he liked this one!  His suggestion- next time make it with diced potatoes instead of macaroni!!  And I think I might. Good meal and very quick and easy. Will definitely make again.",

I think it might have been the peas which overcame the flavor of the corn and mac and cheese. Like cooking lima beans with anything. They cover up flavor. I really wanted to like this as it looked and sounded so good. I did use the Rotel tomatoes and taco seasoning, but I guess not enough as I only used 1 teaspoon like the seasoned salt. If you would please update with suggestions on seasoning amounts as that would be helpful. Spice it up! Chef Charlie (Dallas Texas)",
