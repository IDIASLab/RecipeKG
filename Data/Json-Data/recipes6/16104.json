Plus if you either reheat the cake pain in a sink of hot tap water for about 30 seconds and then tap it out it comes out easily. To make it even easier just use parchment to line the bottom of the cake pan before you butter and flour it. ANY good baker knows both of these tricks and I can only assume the other people who have reviewed the cake don't bake very often or at least they don't bake cakes. This recipe was exquisite very lemony and rich. If you don't like as much lemon just use 1/4 cup milk in place of the lemon juice in the cake recipe and you'll essentially have a white cake to use with the lemon filling and glaze.",

I made the cake 3 times as an experiment with friends & clients & the response was consistent (& I agree): the lemon flavor is good but the cake is way too dense (egg yolks versus whole eggs). The cake was easy to make & I didn't have any problems with the cake coming out of the bundt or tube pan. I always use Baker's Joy spray (plus parchment paper for tube pans) & never have problems. I did like the glaze and decided to use it with another recipe on this site. I modified the Kentucky Butter Cake recipe and then glazed the cake with the lemon glaze from this recipe. The result was good--a lemony cake that was moist and not too dense.",

With that stuff - you could soak a couch cushion in it and it would taste the same. The batter has very little lemon flavor to it - just some lemon juice.  Lemon doesn't hold up well to baking - the flavor sort of dissapates.  I did change the recipe - and I know I hate people's reviews when they change it but - well if others do it, so can I!  I wanted a lemon CAKE.  Not a plain cake soaked in lemon juice.  So - I added the zest of a whole lemon to the batter.  I couldn't see making this thing with what little lemon juice it called for and having any remaining lemon flavor after baking.  Zest was necessary!  Also - I didn't just use egg yolks.  I didn't see the point - so rather than use EIGHT egg yolks: I used 4 whole eggs.  Less work, less hassle, and the cake cooked up BEAUTIFULLY.  This is a very solid nicely colored lemon cake.  Well, at least MY version was!!!",

The cake fell apart coming out of the pan because the center was still hot. (But it tasted yummy so if at first you don't succeed...:) Second try I added an additional 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup more lemon juice to the cake. Before pouring on the hot glaze I used a metal skewer to poke holes in the cake. This allowed the hot glaze to soak more evenly into the cake. I cooled the cake in the pan 1 hour according to directions ran a butter knife around the sides of the pan before turning and it came out perfect.",
