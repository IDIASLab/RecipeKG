After about a year of making a few and combining different ideas, I came up with this one. Every time I've made this, it's been a huge hit and people are always asking me for the recipe, so here it is. The cornstarch absorbs extra moisture and forms a very thin crispy crust on the wings. It's not a heavy breading, it just adds a bit of crunch.",

Could use a bit less butter next time 2 more habaneros but otherwise these were the favorite of the 3 flavors of wings we made.",

The hot sauce was HOOOOOOTTTT (or I put too much) so I had to add more brown sugar and honey to the mixture. They were AMAZING yet again!!! Great recipe - thank you so much!!!",

Definitely way too much it separated and sat on the top. However after I spent ten minutes skimming it off the most beautiful sauce was hiding underneath. Sticky sweet tangy and spicy. I added about ten habaneros and still thought it could use a bit more spicy but the original six would probably be appropriate for a dinner party or for people who like less spice.",

I made these exactly as written and they turned out delicious! I also made a batch of honey barbecue wings for those who might not appreciate the heat and served them both with celery and dip. Just as directed I could see the sauce start to thicken at the 45 minute mark but let it simmer for the full hour so that it was nice and thick. (Next time I may try frying the wings naked without the corn starch coating just to see if that step is necessary.) All in all this recipe is a definite keeper.",
