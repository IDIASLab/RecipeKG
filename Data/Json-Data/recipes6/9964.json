I must preface this review by stressing our pizza was supreme pizza from a local pizzeria and was very flavorful, so plain cheese pizza would not have the same outcome.  I followed the recipe to a \"T\", with the exception of skipping the onion since it was already on the pizza and using an 8X11 pan, as I don't own a 9X9.  It was good, VERY rich (cheesy/buttery/greasy), but good.  While I can't see myself making this again for the two of us, I could see making it if we had a party w/overnight guests w/whom we'd enjoyed some late night pizza for breakfast the next morning.  THANKS for the recipe, Prov31woman!",

I greased a non stick pan just in case. I cut the pizza to arrange in my round pan instead of a squared pan. It was easy crisscrossing the triangles. I followed the recipe and pour all my ingredients on top of the pizza. I cooked on my stove top on low until the eggs were set then to oven for a bit more firm setting of eggs and finished with a quick broil. It came out looking great and it was so good. I omitted the butter that recipe calls to add to mixture. It was not greasy at all. I transferred to round plate and sliced with pizza cutter. It was a hit!!! Thank you for sharing.",
