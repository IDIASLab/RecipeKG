I had never used flavored Philly Cream Cheese before so I was doubtful about the flavor so I bought a jar of Nutella just in case. There was absolutely no need for that because the cream cheese is delicious! The recipe gave me exactly 30 cookies which I baked for exactly 12 minutes. They were firm slightly crisp on the outside soft on the inside. Any longer would have made them crumbly. This cookie is a permanent part of my holiday baking!",
