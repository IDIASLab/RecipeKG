I even had to hide them from my husband. The only change I made was that I used chocolate chunks instead of chips. Didn't have the chips on hand. After I have tried these with the chunks I will only use chunks. With chunks you get more chocolate anyway. These cookies remind me of a brownie cookie more than a cake cookie though. I think you should give this a try. This has become a staple in my house!!!",
