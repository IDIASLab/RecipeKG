I never made BBQ sauce from scratch before so I checked Allrecipes.com like I always do.  I chose this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was VERY good! I doubled the recipe...and I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it a little spice with the sweetness. I would do as another poster said and omit the water. It was too liquid for me, I like a thicker sauce. Oh, I also added some honey. Its not too sweet at all. I would actually add more brown sugar next time, and honey, along with the cayenne pepper. This is a great base BBQ sauce to tweak however you like! I also broiled the ribs first like I always do. And I added a large onion to the crock pot. Cooked it on low for 7 hours and it was delish! =)",

I also seasoned the ribs and threw them on the grill to get a nice caramelization on all sides. I like to call this dish my \"everything but the kitchen sink ribs.\" I have done this recipe before and it turned out great! This time I used brown sugar, molasses and honey (since they were all in the cupboard). I added the juice from 1/2 an orange (because it was in the fridge). I used 1 can of tomato paste and 1 can of tomato sauce (I doubled the recipe and didn't have 2 cans of paste). I threw in some garlic and used apple cider vinegar (becuase I think it gives it a better flavor). This recipe is a great base recipe like other reviewers stated. I recommend you get creative and see what you have in your cupboards or fridge and change it up a little. Last time I used wasabi mustard instead of regular and it was delish!",
