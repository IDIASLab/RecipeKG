It traditionally takes hours to make, as we let the beans slow cook overnight in the oven on low heat. I decided to try and transform it into a much quicker Instant Pot&reg; recipe with great success! With this method, you don't even have to presoak the beans. These are even better the next day, and they freeze well, too.",

The batch I made for the picnic all went and when I got home, I whipped up an batch and froze some of it.  This is my new go to recipe for beans, without a doubt.  These were a hit with everyone and I've given the recipe out to several people already.  Thanks!",
