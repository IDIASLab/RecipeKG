I used butter flavored shortening since I had it on hand and followed the directions exactly. The batter is very thick and needs to be spooned into the pan rather than poured. The addition of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture on top of the final addition of batter makes for a slightly crunchy exterior and moist, tender interior. I checked the cake after 40 minutes and it was still very under-done. After 10 more minutes the toothpick came out clean. The cake turned out beautifully after a 10 minute rest and it smelled heavenly. It's delicious, and I'll definitely be making this one again!",

The only thing that I changed on this recipe is that I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.

I had to substitute FF Greek yogurt for the sour cream but you would never know the difference. I also don't have a 10\" tube pan so I used a 9\" bundt. It just fit whew! Instead of greasing and flouring the pan I sprayed it with butter flavor no stick and dusted it with about 1/3 of the brown sugar cinnamon mix. I used most of the rest inside the cake and just dusted a small amount over the top. It baked up moist and delicious but not too sweet in 50 minutes. I'm happy to report there wasn't a crumb left.",
