The one thing I will say is that at 15 minutes the potatoes do not get done enough. If you want to eat the packets straight off the grill you'll need to leave them on for 20 minutes. If you do pull them off after 15 minutes you'll need to let them rest for 5 minutes while they are still sealed.",

Just two minor differences I mixed the ingredients in a bowl minus the shrimp just to coat everything a little more then added the shrimp and butter on top. My cooking time was a little longer then the 15mins but that I think was only because my grill was off temp wise. Thanks for the share loved it! Kids said better then Joes Crab Shack!",

Only thing I did differently was added about 2 Tbsp of butter to each one and a hard boiled egg. Cooked it for 20 minutes as recommended buy another review and didn't rush to get it off the grill once turned off. Will make this often!!",
