Probably will not make again. Flavor is okay but needs whipped cream or frosting of some kind.",

I also substitued 4 mashed ripe bananas fir the eggs (other reviews had said to use 2 eggs so I used 4 bananas when doubling the recipe) and this gave a SUPER banana flavor which I like but you could also taste the cinnamon applesauce and the raisins.
