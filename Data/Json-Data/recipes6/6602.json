Definitely use low salt Soup.  The chicken was really tender.  I\u2019ll make this again.",

My husband would give it 5 stars.  I give it 4 for taste.  Unfortunately I will NOT make this recipe again as it is just very labor intensive.  Lots of ingredients being cooked on the stove first, then transferrend to the baking dish while it awaits the next layer of ingredients to cook on the stove, and then again.   Make sure you have enough time to prep!",
