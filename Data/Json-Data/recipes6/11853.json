It's also very cakey probably due to the three eggs. I wasn't crazy about the almonds. I love almonds but felt that walnuts or pecans would work better here because of the texture of the cake. My recipe was completely baked in 30 minutes (my oven is accurate). I added chocolate frosting because I wanted more chocolate than this offered.",

The cream cheese doesn't really stand out but the whole thing in its entirety is good enough to make again.  My boyfriend literally ruined his dinner because of this!  ;)",

I also used bakers chocolate instead of choco chips because it's what I had (3 squares = 1/3 cup chips). I melted the shortening and chocolate in the microwave. Once the shortening is melted the chocolate should melt on its own after mixing it around a little. I used my mixer for the rest of the ingredients to make it smoother and I mixed the dry ingredients first before adding them to the mixture. I opted out the nuts because my kids aren't too find of almonds. I will make it again but I'm not sure if I'll add the almond extract again not because it wasn't good but because it seems kind of an unnecessary taste if you don't add the almonds in the first place.",

Also I know this is a brownie not broccoli but watch out for the calorie count in this. The recipe says 139 per brownie but I noticed that is based on 18 brownies cut from a 9X9 pan which is a pretty teeny tiny portion. So if you have a normal sized portion you will be consuming a lot more calories. Again no shocker since it's a chocolate brownie but for those who count calories but still allow for a little indulging beware.:-)",
