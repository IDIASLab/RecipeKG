No one would ever guess how it is made. Even though people were stuffed with food they made room for this. It might be the best dessert I've ever made. Next time I would put it together a couple of days in advance because it got even better as it seasoned. I think the cookie layers would freeze forever and I froze the left overs for a week. It was great when defrosted. Try it you won't be disappointed.",

I did have a bit of difficulty getting seven 9\" cookies out of the recipe but I was able to make it work. Next time I might try 8\" cookies instead. In any event I followed the recipe exactly except I did use half low-fat sour cream and half regular. I also decorated the serving plate and the top of the torte with sugared cranberries and green decorating frosting to resemble holly berries and leaves. Pretty on the \"snow\" of the powdered sugar. This got raves from all and I personally loved it.",
