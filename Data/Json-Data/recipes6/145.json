I've made oatmeal muffins before so I knew to let the batter rest for 15 minutes to give the oats time to soak up some of the liquid and expand. I baked my muffins at 350* for just about 22 minutes. Everyone liked these, even my muffin-picky husband. They turned out fluffy, moist and chewy. Very good muffin. NOTE: If you don't use flavored instant oats, I suggest you add some kind of a flavoring or spice, otherwise these might turn out a little bland.",
