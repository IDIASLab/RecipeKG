I used this recipe (I substituted the new Hershey's Special Dark unsweetened cocoa powder and heaping tablespoons of the powder instead of level ones, because we love dark chocolate) and they turned out wonderful. I don't think anyone could tell that it wasn't the old recipe. The only caution I have for anyone making this recipe is follow the initial cooking instructions carefully. Medium High heat on my stove is a little too hot, but make sure it is thick and bubbly before moving on, otherwise the pie won't set right. The only other tip is make the meringue ahead of time so the pie is very hot when spreading the meringue. This keeps the meringue from shrinking and exposing the chocolate underneath.",

The first time I made it as the recipe states, but it came out too gummy, not creamy like I wanted.  People liked it, but I knew it could be much better.  Second time I added an extra egg yolk to the mix and used 3 TB of cornstarch w/ 2 TB of flour.  After the mix came to a boil I added 2 TB of butter.  I threw the extra egg white in with the meringue, but that was just not to waste because the meringue is fine in this recipe.  With those changes it really makes this pie five stars.",

I reduced the sugar in the meringue by a couple tablespoons also (personal taste) and upped the cornstarch in the pudding by one tablespoon per past experiences with runny puddings/custards for pies. PERFECT. FRIENDLY TIP: per Smitten Kitchen and Joy of Cooking I discovered what happened once to an otherwise delicious pie we had to spoon into bowls to serve: the cornstarch bond CAN be delicate (a cooking mystery involving humidity and magic). Don't stir or move the custard too much once it's good and thick and starting to set. Don't set it aside for a second and let it start to set in the pan and THEN move it to crust don't whisk it too vigorously after it's starting to set etc. I learned the hard way: it was beautiful and thick and then I whisked one more time and set it aside while I whipped the meringue then scraped it out into the pan and it turned back to LIQUID. I was dumbfounded and searched until I found that this CAN happen and this was why!",

I cooked it all over medium heat until it was thick and bubbly and then added the cocoa. Make sure your pie crusts are completely cool or that will result in a runny pie as well. I used 6 egg whites for the meringue and placed it under the broiler for a couple minutes with the oven door open so it wouldn't burn....you have to watch it VERY closely if you do this though. And make sure you \"seal\" the meringue on the edges or it will shrink. The pie set up nicely this way and was delicious.",
