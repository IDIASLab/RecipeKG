When baking time is off and ingredients aren't to the letter making a quality product is next to impossible. I baked this cake as instructed and the result was terrible. 90 minutes is way too long for this cake to bake and I do not know if it was a mistake but 3 and I love cinnamon tablespoons of cinnamon is a bit much. And not only that but after baking for an hour the crust was hard and the cake was dry. I wasted 20 dollars on ingredients and was less than pleased. If I try it again I'll deffinitely make modifications.",

Although 90 minutes is a good rule of thumb for a traditional pound cake the oven temp for this one is a bit higher so a shorter baking time may yield a moister cake. It's definitely worth baking again.",

I only added 2 TBSP of cinnamon I added another 1/2tsp of mexican real vanilla (delish!) I also added a little butter in the cinnamon sugar nut layer. It helped bind and saturate the layer. The biggest thing is that I only baked the cake for 65 minutes in the oven. 90 would have RUINED it. So I guess I should say that with the tips people gave and some of my own it became the best Sock It To Me can I've ever EVER had. I would highly suggest the way I baked it.",
