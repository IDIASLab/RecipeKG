I had to put them in the freezer so I'd stop helping myself to \"just one more piece.\" The cornflakes are not at all discernible once it bakes. I used 10 cups of apples, and 1/2 cup brown sugar, plus 1/4 cup white sugar, plus 1/2 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg. That addition was the only deviation I made from the recipe. Don't skip the nutmeg - it adds depth of complexity to the flavor. Outstanding! The pastry, which is made with milk in classic Danish style (and which differentiates it from classic American pie dough) is tender. The egg white wash makes for a glossy, professional, Kodak-moment finish. I made them to serve at my daughter's bridal shower (if I can keep my fat mitts off of them, that is!) The lovely aroma hung heavy in the air for hours after they were out of the oven, driving everyone crazy. This is a showstopper recipe, any way you look at it. Thank you, Stephanie, for sharing.",

I beat the egg white until frothy and brushed on the top crust. Baked up beautifully in 45 minutes. Slices more easily when cooled.

I did change the recipe to suite my personal taste by using 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. I mixed the sugar cinnamon nutmeg and cloves together before putting it on top of the apples. I left off the corn flakes because I didn't have any. I was worried this would leave liquid and the bottom crust soggy but it did not. My only complaint about this is the difficulty I had with the crust. It was very sticky and difficult to work with. I rolled it on a sheet of floured parchment paper and turned it upside down on the pan. I had to use a lot of flour to not get it to stick to everything and I rolled it very thin to get it to the size I needed it. It turned out well and I was able to seal the top crust to the bottom crust. This recipe is a keeper. I will keep in mind though that this a time consuming recipe dealing with rolling out the crust and peeling and slicing the apples. I wish it had an addition for a glaze recipe I had to look that up. I used 1 cup confectioners sugar 6 tsp. hot water 1 tsp. vanilla and drizzled over the top after removing it from the oven.",
