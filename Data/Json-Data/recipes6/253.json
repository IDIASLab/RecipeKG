We had to add more and more ketchup! What we think happened is that the Worcestershire sauce was just too much. It became overwhelming. I will definitely be trying this recipe again using less Worcestershire sauce by a lot (for 2lbs it called for 2tblsp and 2tsp). I'll start there. I think it'll make a big difference! Looking forward to a refined recipe and will update this when I've got it figured out!",
