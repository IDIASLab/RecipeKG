This is a more dense sturdy cake. Almost brownie-like without the sickening sweetness of a brownie. For Christmas I baked this cake then layed mini peppermint patties and milk chocolate chips on top right out of the oven. After a few minutes they were melted and I spread them around the top for a marbled mint chocolate frosting.",

The evaporated milk and cocoa powder should be cooked at low heat so that the cocoa will dissolve without burning the milk. The frosting should be cooked at low while the cocoa powder dissolves but then turned to medium high so that it will boil and then thicken. I stirred the frosting for about 1/2 hour before I just turned it up. I should have done that about 25 minutes before that.",

Also the frosting tasted like nothing but thick condensed milk. I may try this again when I'm looking to experiment a little and use another reviewer's idea of putting chocolate mints on top of the hot cake and allowing those to melt to make the frosting instead.",
