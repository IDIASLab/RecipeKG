To the spice mixture we added 1/4 t of Italian Seasonings & 1/4t of Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb Seasonings.  Also, while chicken cubes were frying I sprinkled chicken with salt.  Omitted the Onion & replaced with 1/4t Onion Powder.  Let it cook about 5 min. each side.  Replaced the beans with 1 can drained corn.  I made the dough a couple times because I thought it was rather dry & maybe I did something wrong.  Anyhow, it was hard to roll out, it was brittle & wasn't working like a dough.  I got it to  work by using it as is & I am glad I did.  Placed it in my 9\" glass pie dish.  Baked it with the ingr. inside  covered with the Top Dough & made slits.  It was done in 24 min. It was phenomenal!  This whole pie is exactly what I was looking for today!  A quick and easy lunch that was really made in minutes.  The thing that was a little bit of time was the pie crust and I am glad I made it, even my picky husband said it was wonderful and flaky and tasted awesome.  Yes, he said awesome!  He also said this was the best Chicken Pot Pie he ever had!  He finished it off in a couple days & asked me to make it every week!  Great!  I will make this often, although not weekly!  UPDATE: Made this again & again, now I pre-chilled the shortening for 1hr first.  Also, roll out dough between 2 sheets of wax paper.  Perfection!",
