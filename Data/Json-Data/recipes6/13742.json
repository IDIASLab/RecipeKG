If you stir the pudding every 15 minutes while baking, you won't get a crusty top, and it will be less cake-like and more like a true pudding. Very rich, so we just top with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Its also delicious cold.",

Be advised, when i put this in the pan to go in the oven, it looked awful, but it turned out as the yummiest type of thick pudding I've ever had.  And to save money I used over-ripe persimmons, the kind that small markets will sell for a fraction of the cost (like brown bananas).  I will make this year-round, but the flavors are especially appropriate in the fall.",

Of course, the butter sauce (follows) is a key part--cut the pudding into squares, place on individual serving plates with an ample drizzle of butter sauce. Two cups of persimmon pulp equals 5-6 persimmons, peeled and blended in a food processor. I eliminated the baking powder because we like a dense pudding, and the little bit of soda works just fine. If you do that, you must use buttermilk rather than plain milk. I cut the sugar back to 1-1/2 cups and upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. The baking time required for me was 1 hour and 10 minutes. This also freezes well, wrapped tightly in foil. Make it in season, enjoy all year. Butter sauce: Combine in saucepan: 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup cream, pinch of salt and 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla. Heat until sugar is melted and mixture is smooth.",

I also had less than half a can of pumpkin leftover so I threw that into the mix. This was SO good. In fact as I was attempting to stir every so often throughout cooking my roommate and I ended up using that to take huge bites while it cooked. Seriously SO good. I love the texture of this pudding.

You can cut another 1/4 cup sugar when using hachiyas. The fuyu persimmons are less sweet. I use 2 cups sugar for them.",
