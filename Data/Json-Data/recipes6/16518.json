I probably increased the butter, didn't actually measure, jut added untill the oat mixture was a good consistency. I added some real vanilla and a few tsps of almond extract to the butter before I added it to the oats. (I really like almond flavour and apples together) I also added the cinnamon right to the oatmeal mixture, rather then sprinkle it on the apples. Oh, and I added some nutmeg as well. Served it warm, a la mode, and it was greeat! Thanx for this recipe! :)",
