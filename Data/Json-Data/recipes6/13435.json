After creaming the butter and sugar together for 5 minutes, I use a kitchenaid mixer and beat each fresh, cold egg for 5 minutes. It has never turned out soupy for me. I also use regular sugar, and increase the cocoa to taste (6-8 TBS depending on where the pie is going). My suggestion is to add 6 tbs of cocoa, mix, then taste test - it should taste slightly stronger than you want the completed pie to taste. Even with regular sugar the pie has never been grainy, nor does it have a mousse like texture - it is very silky smooth. I prefer to top with store bought whipped cream piped on top, and chocolate shavings.",

You don't need to refrigerate the mixture in between, or wait too long when adding the eggs - just use a wire wisk and slowly and carefully whip the mixture together.",

Great idea!  \n\nUpdate: I tried the Bakers Sugar as suggested, it's perfect for this recipe!  \n\nFinally, I added probably 3 tbs. more cocoa than this recepie called for.  Before adding the extra, it was more sweet than chocolaty and the extra cocoa seemed to balance it out nicely.",

I added a few chocolate shavings on top. I think it's essential to have a large stand mixer (I use a Kitchenaid) as you MUST beat on high speed for at least 5 minutes after the addition of each egg. I can't imagine doing this with a hand mixer. I also chose to cream the butter & sugar for 10 minutes prior to the addition of the eggs. Using baker's sugar (easy to find in your grocery store) is also a help as it is more fine than regular sugar. After adding the final egg I continued at high speed for another 10 minutes. The filling was light and fluffy and absolutely delicious. My husband licked the bowl. It also set up very quickly and I was able to serve it within an hour. I'll be making this one again...soon!",

Using egg beaters instead of eggs makes this a safer dessert because they are pasteurized. After beating 5 full minutes after each egg addition I threw the filling in the freezer for 15 minutes and then whipped it up for 2-3 final minutes. It set perfectly. I'm not much of a whipped cream fanatic but I found that it was the perfect addition to this dessert not only because it was a nice decorative touch but it also countered some of the sweetness. A dusting of chocolate shavings and its official: my pie was a beautiful masterpiece!",

I thought it was going to be ok since it wasn't soupy like others described but yet it wasn't exactly set either. I chilled it for an hour then put the whole thing in the freezer because I still wasn't too sure if it was setting or not? An hour later I put it back to the refrigerator until it was time to eat and it was like eating chocolate mouse. My guests said it was good but for me it was just \"ok\". Not too sweet and not too chocolately either and I had added 6-7 Tbsp. cocoa likes others had suggested. It was definately an easy dessert to prepare except the 30 minutes spent just beating eggs. The other dessert I made was \"Better than sex cake\" which took a lot less time to prepare and was so much more delightful and satisfying. My vote is for the \"other\" dessert... pass on this hit or miss option.",
