I used a pie crust that was made completely with Butter (no crisco) and I baked it in a 9\"x9\" square baking pan. I also used about a cup and a half of black cherries because I was short blackberries. The crumbled topping made it look more like a cobbler and my partner said it was maybe the best dessert he's ever had. The lemon really makes for a lovely pie topping.",
