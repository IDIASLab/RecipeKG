I couldn't find almond butter, so I had to cheat and use regular, sweet cream, unsalted butter (I know, this is not paleo) but I made everything else exactly as the recipe stated.   These had a nice flavor and browned up nicely, too.  I didn't think the cooking time was anything out of the ordinary.  The texture, of course, isn't the same as \"standard\" pancakes, but even my fiancee' said they were good and he'd eat them again.  (He's VERY particular about food.)  I'm going to try tweaking it a little, with more and less almond flour, adding some honey, and maybe trying some different spices, like nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  Maybe some almond extract instead of vanilla, too.  I'm thinking this recipe is a great one to potentially make in different versions, for a little variety.  \n\nFor the reviewer who asked about paleo syrup:  Real, unprocessed maple syrup is considered paleo-friendly.  As is raw, unprocessed honey.",
