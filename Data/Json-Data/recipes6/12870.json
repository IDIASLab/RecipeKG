I do have to admit though that the fluffy consistency of this cookie reminded me of french madeleines. Now that doesn't mean that it tastes anything like madeleines but I did change the recipe to make myself a madeleine knock off. I will post my recipe changes after I've made them and let you all know if it turned out good. It's shocking that there is even one person out there that thinks this cookie is great tasting. I guess if I had no taste buds I might find the cookie good too.",

I tried to salvage it by adding other flavorings coconut and almond to no avail. The cooky was also dry so I made a recipe of tollhouse cooky dough but did not add the flour or baking soda called for. Mixed that with this recipe's dough and at least got an eatable cooky. A lot of work to get 1 good cooky",
