Everytime the holidays come around, people start asking, are you going to make that candy with the caramel and nougat in it? Truly better than a Snickers bar. And a tip: coat the inside of your 9x13 pan with a thin layer of non-stick cooking spray, then freeze the bottom layer before adding the other layers. That will help it not to stick.",

I use the microwave to melt the chocolate layers and the caramel layer. Just check your chips after every 30 seconds (stirring each time you check). Do not overcook chocolate in the microwave!\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

The waxed paper pulled away really easier. I did cut it one piece at a time in 1 inch squares. They look and taste great. ",

Pour that on the filling and refridgerate then do the top layer.",

I did follow some of the suggestions from all of the wonderful cooks out there and I had no problems with it at all. I did line my pan with parchment paper and totally chilled each layer before adding the next. Another tip I followed was to allow the top layer to chill for a bit and then I scored it with a very sharp knife. I scored it into 1x1 inch squares and when it was totally chilled I had no trouble cutting it. I did remove it from the pan in one big piece using the parchment paper and then cut it. I also heated my knife under hot water and cleaned it often. I wanted perfectly cut pieces for the contest. The recipe and the hints did not disappoint. One 13x9 pan makes a ton and it will be a wonderful addition to my Christmas Goodies I pass out to friends and familly. Thanks again!",

We had to eat it with a fork my girls who are big chocolate lovers didn't even finish their small piece. I won't be making this again but I would recommend that others try a graham cracker crust or something that allows this to be more manageable. Each layer tasted great as I was making it but all together is just too much for me.",
