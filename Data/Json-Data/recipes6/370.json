I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted ground flax seed meal for the wheat germ because that's what I had. They're a bit dense but I like that. Most of all they are super filling and excellent with coffee. It says 8 servings but those would be he huge cookies. I found that it makes about 24 smaller cookies or 12 servings so I eat two. It's only 5 Points Plus points! Even my 12-year old likes them.",
