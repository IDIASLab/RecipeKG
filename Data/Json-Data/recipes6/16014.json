One thing you need to know, the cucumbers really reduce down once they have sat in the vinegar. I filled jars and processd them in a hot water bath, and when they came out the jars were only half full.  I would let the mixture sit in the bowl for at least 2 hours and then fill your jars if you are going to process them. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "I rated these 4 stars because I made some modifications.  I added 1 tbsp of mustard seed, 1 tsp of celery seed, and 1 tsp of turmeric (to make them bread and butter pickles).  Also, not mentioned in the recipe but very important, if your brine doesn't cover your cucumbers, don't add extra water.  The cucumbers will release water into the brine and then it will cover them.\n\nIf this is your first time making pickles, here are a few notes so you can avoid the mistakes I made:\n1. Don't use white onion, it's too strong.  Use sweet or vidalia onions.\n2. Slice the onion and green pepper into strips, don't dice them.  If you dice them the flavour is too strong.\n3. Cucumber sliced thinly (1/8-1/4 inch) will pickle in 1-2 days, and will stay crisp for 3-5 days.  Cucumber sliced thickly (3/8-1/2 inch) will pickle in 3-4 days, and will stay crisp for a week or more.  So if you want pickles now and later, do a jar of each.\n4. If you use this brine to pickle other things (I did cauliflower, green peppers and asparagus) you need to use more brine on those vegetables than you did on the cucumber.  I added water to the brine thinking that when I made cucumber pickles, they released water which added the extra liquid to the brine.  That didn't work.  You need to cover the almost completely, then finish with water, to make a strong enough brine for other vegetables.  Steaming the vegetables first might help too, I haven't tried that yet.",

I did add more vinegar with others advice but found (since it was the first time I made pickles) that after the cucumbers sit in the fridge overnight the 1st time, they will create more juice and more liquid will appear.  So, I would not fill up my bottles completely with liquid before letting them refrigerate.  Thanks for the recipe!",
