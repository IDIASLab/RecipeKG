Before adding the zucchini I let it sit with some salt for 30 mins to get the extra moisture out, but that made my batter was too dry so I added another egg. Then I used pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cloves, and with the raisins I tossed in a handful each of pumpkin seeds, pecan pieces and coconut. I ended up with about 4 dozen soft, perfectly golden and very tasty cookies. I may never make them again though, because I can't stop eating them.",

I love the fact that I can hide a vege in my husband's cookies (yes kids come in all ages). The only thing that was a little odd is that my cookies did not spread out - they stayed mounded but that could be because I used gluten-free flour. Other than the GF flour substitution I made these exactly to instructions and will definitely make them again. A not-too-sweet very tasty all around great cookie!",

We found these cookies very flavorful delicious and perfectly moist. They are like a cross between a cookie and a muffin. Perfect with a cup of coffee. Just the right size.

Many other reviews mention it being cakey, which is absolutely true so I found that these veered more towards a breakfast treat. To make these breast-feeding-friendly, I also added 1 TB brewer's yeast, 1 TB wheat germ, and half coconut oil for the butter. Very tasty right out of the oven yum yum!",
