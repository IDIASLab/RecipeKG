The grape raspberry and grape peach are really good (and strong!) but the grape is by far the best.  I used 6 cups of sugar and the result is a very sweet wine, which is what we like.  I used yeast made especially for wine and I boiled my water and sugar to make sure all the sugar dissolved.  After 5 weeks I poured through coffee filters and transferred wine to another container for a couple of weeks before bottling.  This is the perfect wine to use to make Sangria. ",

                "reviewBody": "Great intro recipe for starters into brewing your own wine at home!  Some additional tips because there are some things that you arent told:  1.  Use more cans of concentrate and less sugar for a stronger flavored wine (3 cans and 1/2 cup sugar or 2 cans and 2 1/2 cups of sugar)  2.  Siphon off after 2 weeks of starting to get the wine on the lees (dead yeast) so the wine wont taste as funky...if you leave it on the dead yeast for 5 weeks it will be super musty-flavored  3.  Use Hawaiin punch jug and drill hole in top and hot glue a 1/4\" tube from Lowes (about 2ft is 20 cents) and run tube to a jar/bottle of water.  Keep submerged in water so air cant spoil wine and you dont have to worry about rubber balloon taste, etc..  4.  a 5 gram packet of wine yeast makes 5 gallons.  Im trying a batch right now just using 1 gram of yeast per gallon.  See next step of how to prep yeast to ensure survival.  Using 1 gram should cut musty bread flavor of wine, even if using bread yeast.  (packets of bread yeast are usually 7 grams)  5.  Prep yeast by rehydrating and feeding.  Put amount of yeast in lukewarm water and let it rehydrate and foam then feed it a teaspoon or 2 of sugar so it can begin multiplying the yeast count and start on its job.  Then add it to the wine mixture of juice and sugar  Hope this helps the newcomers a bit more!  Thanks for the original recipe!",

She called me that day after she got home from school and was frantic... come help me clean this up!  It had exploded in her bedroom closet.  What a mess.  The whole house reeked of wine!
