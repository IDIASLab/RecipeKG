I did sub smoked cheddar for the smoked provolone b/c that's what I had but everything else was just as is. I didn't have soft pretzels on hand so we just used regular pretzels and that was fine but I can't wait to get to the store to get some soft pretzels. Really great combo of flavors...I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Now I can make soft pretzels to finish it off. Maybe I'll share. Next time I will try the suggestions to add more beer to thin it out more like a sauce though I thought the consistency as-is was fine for a dip.",
