I actually enjoy that much heat in many recipes, but in this recipe it dominates too much over the more subtle flavors.  I will cut in half at least next time, and maybe a quarter for my toddlers' sake.\n\nA really neat thing about this recipe is that most of the ingredients are dry or easily replaced with dry ingredients, so it is easy to pre-mix on the weekend, store in a Ziploc bag on a shelf, and then throw in a crockpot with 2 quarts of water in the morning before work any day of the week - or even a month later, if you use an oxygen-reducing packet.  I replaced broth with boullion and garlic with garlic powder.  Button mushrooms were the only fresh ingredient we used, and I since found a way to order freeze-dried mushrooms - so next time I will be using entirely dry ingredients and then will \"just add water\".
