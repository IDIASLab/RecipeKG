I think this is one of the mysteries of the recipe.  Since I had soaked it for so long, the peels were really soft, so I boiled for a shorter time.  I think for the first boil, we need a time as that will seriously effect the amount of liquid.  I did measure out 3 cups of fruit (I used a blender to chop) and added 7 cups of water instead of 9.\n\nI still added 9 cups of sugar.  I added 1/2 cup lemon instead of 1/4 because it seemed so sweet.  I did not add pectin.  I boiled until 220, poured in jars, then processed to seal.\n\nMy marmalade did gel - not completely like store bought, but enough to spread, and it tastes delicious.  \n\nNext time I would take out another cup or 2 of water.  I think I would like less sweet, but I know the amount of sugar effects the gelling.  Maybe I would take out one orange and add more lemon juice?  \n\nBut you can definitely do this without pectin.  I highly recommend.",

You could however go to the trouble to remove the peel from the quartered oranges, scrape off more of the white part, and then slice the peel with a knife, if you want to remove any bitter taste, but its good as is.  Dont bother rechopping kumquats (just slice them on a mandolin).  I wonder why it says to add water and soak overnighta step not called for in other recipes.  I decided to add a packet of regular pectin as insurance on warning of another reviewer, at about 218 degrees (never could reach 220 degrees).  Highly recommend the pectin; texture is perfect.",
