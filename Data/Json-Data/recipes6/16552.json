For my crust: Combine 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1/3 cup confectioners sugar and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon in a bowl. Pour in 1/4 cup melted butter and mix well. Press into bottom of springform pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350 before adding filling to pan.",

One change: While mixing the 1 c. cream cheese mix with the 1/2 c. pumpkin puree I noticed that it looked a bit too \"cream cheesey\" so I added pumpkin puree until it looked & smelled more pumpkin-y (about another 3/4 cup). I then put in 1 1/2 cups of that new mixture in to the pie tin. It was a perfect mix of pumpkin flavor on top cheesecake flavor on the bottom but all with the consistency of cheesecake. And it serves beautifully as well!",
