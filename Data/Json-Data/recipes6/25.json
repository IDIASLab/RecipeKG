Instead of simmering for 1-2 hours I put the burner on high and rapid boiled it for about 25 minutes stirring constantly. And instead of using the hot water canning process I put the chutney in 8 oz. jelly jars and pressure canned it at 6 pounds pressure for 10 minutes. I doubled the recipe and made 14 - 8 oz. jars of this delicious thick condiment. Today a month later I'm doing it all over again to use as gifts. Besides being a wonderful compliment on pork and chicken try dumping 8 ounces of this in a batch of jasmine rice right before serving.",
