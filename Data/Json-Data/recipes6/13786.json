It's possible that I didn't do one of the steps right for instance beat the yolks long enough or cook long enough until thickened. I think next time I will skip folding the egg whites into the pumpkin mixture in order to make the texture a little more solid and easy to cut. I also used a graham cracker crust which went well with the other flavors. Overall a great recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks for the recipe I really liked this pie! The whipped cream mixture alone was to die for. I doubled the recipe using 2 9\" Pet Ritz deep dish pie crusts and I still have enough of the pumpkin mixture for at least 1 probably 2 more pies?! (Bought 2 small cartons of whipping cream only needed 1 so it works out!) I really like that there was so much pumpkin in the pie. So many recipes call for only small amounts of pumpkin. It really held its own with the other flavors (e.g. nutmeg & allspice) although overall the whipped cream overwhelmed the pie a bit. I don't know that less whipped cream would be enough to thoroughly cover the layers of pumpkin mixture but if I make this again I might try it with less confectioners' sugar and maybe a little more white sugar in the pumpkin mixture? I would love suggestions! I went into this expecting it to require a decent amount of effort and still feel compelled to strongly recommend you make this only if you have a slow day at home where you can plan to spend a good deal of it on the recipe and the cleanup and washing bowls/utensils between steps depending on how much equipment you have in your kitchen! Several steps required a mixer so at the very least you will have to wash the beaters etc. between steps. Too bad you can't prep much of anything or keep it for long but it was as reviewed a \"light\" alternative to traditional pie and a great flavor very nice to bring to a party if you can keep very cold!",
