Growing up vegetarian, I've eaten a lot of lentil loaf (and cottage cheese loaf) and always thought it was too dry and tasteless. Then I found this recipe. My carnivore husband went back for seconds and told me it was better than any meatloaf he'd ever eaten! I added an additional egg, used wheat bread instead of white, subbed ketchup for the tomato paste and used onion soup mix rather than vegetable. Just had the leftovers for lunch. Yum!",

However, in all fairness, I should mention that I didn't follow it exactly.  I was anticipating that it might be too dry (after reading some of the other reviews) and added an extra egg and a little more olive oil.  With these changes, I liked it a lot - 5 stars - but the recipe as is gets 4 stars.  Other modifications:  I put cheddar cheese on top instead of bread crumbs - 10 minutes at 400 degrees turned out to be just right for a cheese \"crust\".  I used potato soup mix, and it really complemented the other ingredients.  Also, I divided the mixture into two small loaf pans so that I could freeze one for later.  Thanks, Karen!   EDIT 11/1/06:  These loaves reheat perfectly!  I thawed mine out in the oven until it was soft enough to cut, then sliced off a piece and nuked it, & refrigerated the rest until I used it all up.  Worked like a charm.",

I followed the suggestions of others and substituted ketchup for tomato paste & whole wheat bread for white. I used crimson lentils as well and the color of the loaf and consistency going into the pan was far firmer than other attempts. Instead of bread crumbs I put a little barbecue sauce on before putting it in the oven and cheese for the last 10 minutes. Overall it looks and smells terrific. It sliced easily and everyone in my family loved it although we all love lentils. This was a great recipe although I might try using egg replacer instead of the egg next time.",

I would suggest lining your loaf pan with either parchment or wax paper before filling with the lentil mixture if you like to make a nice presentation.\n\nI would not suggest adding the 1/3 cup of bread crumbs as suggested either...just a dusting will do as the rest will just fall off.\n\nAll in all, I was very pleased with this dish.

I threw in 2 chopped garlic cloves for the last minute. I added one extra egg and 1/2 a cup of whole grain bread crumbs. As I am concerned about sodium and most dry soup mixes are incredibly high I left out the dry soup mix and put in 1 cup of water instead of vegetable broth. Also used 2 tbls of low cal ketchup in place of the tomato paste. I basically stood in front of my spice cupboard and threw in a bit of everything. I had the lentils in one bowl with the bread crumbs and sauted veggies and in another I combined the eggs water ketchup olive oil and some chopped cilantro. Gave it all a good whisk then added it to the lentil bowl. Mixed everything well and put it in a convection oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. Took out let sit for five and then enjoyed. Did not put breadcrumb topping on. Was really delicious - nice and moist. I'd made a lentil loaf before and it was dry and tasteless. This was a winner and I'll make again and recomend.",
