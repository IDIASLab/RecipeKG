I reduced the soy sauce a bit and added water to make up the difference since I was concerned it might be too salty. I also skipped the sriracha in the quick pickles and added a sliced jalapeno instead. We really enjoyed it. Hubby told me to not lose this recipe which is high praise from him. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Nicole.",

I didn't have some of the ingredients, such as cucumbers and red onions, sriracha, or buns, BUT this was an excellent starting point. \n\nFor the pickle, I agree with the author that red onions would be best but yellow onions worked fine. Rather than cucumbers, I used fine cuts of zucchini, which I will use again.\n\nNot having buns I served it over rice, which I would also use again. \n\nI advise following the recipe regarding the hamburger. Just browning it a few minutes and finish it off in the sauce, which blends the flavor into the meat. The leftovers were even better, for the same reason. The same goes for the pickled zucchini. \n\nOverall a flavorful, simple, and versatile recipe.",
