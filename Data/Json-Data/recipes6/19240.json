I did change of a few things yes but with the exception of the 4 tsps. of onion salt, I think the recipe would be very tasty as written. I boiled some peeled diced potatoes in chicken stock as I browned about a half of pound of ground beef and then later added both to the soup ( I like a more hearty soup). I used more pickles and juice and even left some of my pickles in bigger hunks because I really wanted to taste the pickles. VERY good and very unique and even though this is not a soup I would want on a weekly basis, I will be making it over and over throughout the years. Oh, also thought I'd mention that for me 2 tablespoons of butter was not enough to whisk a 1/2 cup of flour but that might have just been me. Pretty simple fix to just keep adding butter until you get your flour smooth but thought I'd mention it in case anyone had any troubles there. Thank you for the most unusual soup this soup loving gal has ever tried!*****update*****I have made this soup 3 times now and it turns out a little different each time but always good. I used pickles with tobasco sauce this go around and that added a nice kick. I do think potatoes are a must and I left out the ground beef this time but will be adding it back next go around. This one has become a favorite in my house. Thanks again!",

Surprisingly the pickles, juice, milk and curry powder worked.\nUPDATE: I've made this one several times in the past few months.  Everybody, including those who don't like pickles says this is the best soup they're ever had. At first I started adding onions to the beginning of the soup.  I now use a bunch of leeks, sliced thinly and washed instead of the onions at the beginning of making the soup.  The leeks add to the creaminess, and they're an amazing mild compliment to the strong pickled dills.",
