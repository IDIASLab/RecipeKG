When I was preparing this I knew that the celery would be a bit crunchy since it was cooking for such a short time-and I was right.  I had increased this to serve 12 since it sounded so good- but got lots of celery comments!!  Like - \"Rita, was there a sale on celery?\". Celery lovers - this soup is for you.  Like others I did substitute spinach for lettuce and angel hair pasta for Ramen noodles since I ran out of ramen. If you use angel hair you can put the pasta in this soup with the chicken and then cook it for 2 min. when it comes to a boil.  Angel hair is always a good substitution for ramen noodles (break the pasta in half).",

Instead of lettuce I used chopped fresh spinach-the taste was great and stirred in 2 fresh eggs at the end ( like an egg drop soup). I only used 1 1/2 tsp of Asian chili paste and believe me that was HOT enough! I used wun tun noodles but served the soup OVER them. It works very well over rice too. This soup had a wonderful flavour. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.",
