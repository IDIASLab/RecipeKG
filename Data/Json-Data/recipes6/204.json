We're about in the middle on spicy foods, and my gut was telling me that this was going to be too hot, but I hate to modify a recipe too much the first time through.  The reviews were Interesting, too, because the spiciness didn't seem to be as much of an issue as the strong vinegar flavor...maybe we really are wimps!  I had no issue with the vinegar, this is \"Carolina-style\" which traditionally has more of a potent vinegar flavor.  Unless you like your food smokin' hot, I'd recommend that you start with a teaspoon, taste, and then add more red pepper flakes and black pepper as you see fit.  You can always add more, but once it's in there, you can't take it out.  I had a container of Kaluha Pig in the freezer, so I added this sauce for some pulled-pork sandwiches.",

That is not saying it is not a great tasting sauce, but it is not the way we make it in South Carolina, the birthplace of mustard-based BBQ sauce. I have lived in SC my entire life (53 years) and have been writing about SC BBQ specifically since 2012. I have tried a wide variety of mustard sauces -- we have a lot of different styles in the state -- and, of course, we make our own. This is nothing like what we have here.
