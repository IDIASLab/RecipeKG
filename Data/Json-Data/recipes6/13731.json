The only reason this matters is that these \"bars\" are best served like a sheet cake on a plate with a fork. I wouldn't call these a grab-and-go type thing. Nonetheless I was entirely pleased with these. While I do like pumpkin bars/cakes made with vegetable oil I did appreciate that this was made with butter and the taste difference is noticeable and pleasant. I'm not a big fan of nutmeg and the recipe seemed a little short on spice so in addition to the cinnamon I substituted 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice for the 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. And because I'm kind of tired of the same ol' cream cheese frosting I made a caramel frosting instead and sprinkled some crushed cinnamon cookies over the top. It was a great flavor combination but this cake is so moist and flavorful it would be great with no frosting at all.",
