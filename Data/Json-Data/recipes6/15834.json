My only alterations were: not mashing the bananas (they were ripe enough to just break in half and put in the bottom of the bread pan and let the machine do the work); Using whole wheat bread machine flour since we were out of white BMF; no orange extract (didn't have any); and I did add two heaping tbsps of flour during the mixing cycle since it looked so liquidy. This may not have been necessary but it sure looked like it was. I kept everything else in the recipe exact and the flavors came together so well. This is one of the best breads I've made in the bread machine the flavor is so yummy. It is not sweet but very hearty if you want it sweeter I'd add 1/4 cup brown sugar but you should try it the way it's written first you won't be dissapointed. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!",

I let my bread machine do the work thru the second rise then I took it out to shape into loaf and bake in the oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. Yummy! Because the dough was somewhat sticky I will add 2-4T of flour extra next time.Thanks for sharing Julie. This is a definite keeper...and it makes great toast too!",

I had to add 3/4 c more flour to get to a bread dough consistency. I didn't bother mashing the bananas either; bread machines will chop things up pretty well on their own so I don't usually mash or chop myself. I used almond extract and lemon extract (don't have butter or orange extract although I think I'll get some!) and the dough smelled so wonderful while mixing. I baked in the oven at 375 for 50 min and it came out a beautiful loaf. I let it sit in the warm oven for a bit longer just to make sure it was baked and it worked well. thanks for the recipe!",
