Everyone loved it!\n\nWord of caution: don't use a handheld mixer! When I added the third cup of flour it nearly burned the motor out! I will use my food processor next time. I am also going to try sea salt/kosher salt instead of table salt next time as well.\n\nMine was done in 38 minutes but would have been ok at 40.",

Also, I love how there is no kneading invloved; this would be a very good recipe for someone who is just learning how to make bread.  Thanks for sharing!!  :)",
