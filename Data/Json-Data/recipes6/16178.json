They all were great, but these Japanese Chicken Wings were our favorite. So sweet, so flavorful, so crispy, so moist! One word of caution... line your roasting/baking pan with sturdy aluminum foil. The sugar/vinegar sauce gets very gooey near the end of the baking portion of the recipe and can be tough to clean up.",

I don't like to fry food unless it is really necessary to improve the taste and in this case it isn't necessary and in my opinnion does not inprove taste.  To make my chicken I used wings, cut them up and put them in a bowl.  I then poured about 1-2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil on them and made sure all the wings had a light coating of oil.  I then placed the wigs on a broiler pan and put them in the oven (set to broil) until the wings were brown on one side and then I browned the other side.  This is much faster than frying, uses much less oil and is much healthier.  I then put the wings in a baking dish with the sauce mixture from the recipe (I only used half a cup of sugar) and cooked them in the oven like the recipe says.  This way tasted much better than frying (in my opinion). But also, this way, the wings are less crispy.  If you want crispy wings you better fry them.",

I did tweak it a little though-i placed the wings in a pan and sprinkled them generously with garlic powder and paprika-then sprayed them with pam. I baked them at 375 for 35 min-then i flipped them respiced them and baked them for another 25 min. After that i poured on the sauce and baked them another 20-25 min. I find this recipe very quick and easy and it is always a hit with my guests. You wont regret trying this recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "Awesome!  I used only 1/2 of the sugar recipe calls for and used half white vinegar and half seasoned rice vinegar found in Asian markets.  I tried 3 different cooking variations: 1)followed the recipe's cooking method using butter to fry in before putting it in the oven. This was good, but I felt the butter overpowered the goodness of the sauce -btw, I LOVE butter, but frying the wings in butter was a step you can definitely omit and save the calories on. 2) I followed reviewers suggestions and oven-fried. I coated with egg & flour and baked @ 400 for 25 min turning once then added sauce and baked additional 30 min @ 350.  This was by far the best. The skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was fabulous. 3) I coated with egg and panko flakes, baked @400 for 25 turning once, added sauce, baked addition 30 @350. This was also good and my second favorite. the panko really soaks up the sauce and gives the wing a more sweet-sticky coat then a crispy-sticky. so it depends on your taste.  For all 3 variations, once the sauce was added (lined baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup), I turned the wings a few times and then removed the wings from the sauce and placed on fresh foil over baking sheet for the last 5 min.Can't wait to make it again! I forgot to add the sesame seeds like the pictures show and really wish I didn't. I'm sure the sesame seeds are a perfect touch..",

While the finished product looked and smelled wonderful and was relatively easy to prepare, the taste was overpoweringly sweet. I should have known better, but given the high ratings, thought that all these reviewers can't be wrong. Some mentioned adding cayenne pepper to \"balance the sweetness\" but in retrospect, I'm rather inclined believe that there's something a little wrong with a chicken dish that has as much sugar in it as an average dessert. Perhaps I'd use it again as an appetizer where you'd only eat one or two, but as a main dish for already sugar-addicted kids I'd vote no.",

Instead of frying the wings i simply washed them, patted them dry, seasoned and put them under the broiler.  I turned them over and over again and they end up very crispy.  I then drained the fat and followed by adding the sauce. With the added corn starch, the sauce ends up very thick and rich  Served it with coconut rice and grilled veggies. Amazing!",
