I omitted the sugar even though there's hardly any but I don't like too-sweet French Onion Soups and I used Vidalia onions which are sweet on their own. I slathered some minced garlic on the toast instead of just rubbing a clove since we love garlic in this house. You may miss the gooey mouth-feel from the lack of gobs of cheese but the flavor is still really good and this is much healthier. Be careful not to add too much black pepper without taste-testing as it is quite noticeable but not excessive as long as you like pepper. Great recipe!",

I've made french onion before and I believe the buttery taste of the onions lend to the flavor of the soup. I know its only a tsp but it added a hint of a buttery flavor. Other then that I used it to the T and it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",
