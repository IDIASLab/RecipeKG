        "description": "I was tired of finding apple butter recipes with more sugar than apples, so I adapted a few and perfected it. This recipe makes the house smell fantastic and tastes like fall. Enjoy! If you do not have an immersion blender: allow cooked apples to cool, transfer to a regular blender, and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust the flavor. If the texture is too liquidy still, return to slow cooker and allow it to reduce for about another hour more. This recipe is really about adjusting to your taste. If you like a lighter color, cook it less. If you want it highly spiced, throw on the cloves, etc. This recipe freezes well.",

Interestingly the first came out much thicker than the other (I think I left it too long so there was less liquid at the end to reduce... it produced much less apple butter than the other did but the consistency was nice.) I used dark brown sugar rather than light and added about a half tablespoon or so of allspice because I wanted a warmer flavor. The lack of extra sugars made for a really nice balance of sweet and sour. Definitely would recommend.",

I omitted the cloves just because i personally don't care for cloves I also only put in 3 tsp cinnamon because I didn't want it to be over powering I figured I could add more after cooking if it needed it which I did not end up doing just because of personal preference I cooked it for five hours on low then turned the crock pot to high for about 2 hrs just because I was running short on time then I blended it as directed filled some jelly canning jars put them in boiling water for ten min to can the extra for later use. Thank you for such a great recipe. It's a great way to use up apples when they get over ripe and soft.",
