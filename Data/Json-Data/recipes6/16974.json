Replaced eggs (because of allergy in family) with 1/2 banana mashed 1/4 cup sour milk and 1 1/2 tsp powdered egg replacement. Made enough for 24 cupcakes and cooked a little longer (35mins). Also I would use paper liners next time. I greased and found the tops would tend to come off when removing from the pan. Fantastic recipe!",

Substituted 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 bisquick and also 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. While not quite as sweet but sweet enough was much healthier. Also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 buttery spread with same amt of olive oil and came out fine. Think that using brown sugar might enhance the taste. Will try next time. Also used walnuts instead of all the zucchini ( only use about a cup) and will likely fare well with the nut lovers. Alot of vit e in walnuts----good for you!!!!! Good luck.",
