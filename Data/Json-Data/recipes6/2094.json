I made my own chickpea flour by grinding up dried chickpeas until very fine and then sifting out the flour (only do this in a heavy duty blender and not a food processor or you'll burn it out). I also upped the peanut butter to 1/2 cup (we have a bit of a peanut butter addiction in our house) used about 3/4 cup rolled oats 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips in place of the chunks. I also wouldn't generously grease your cookie sheets as these cookies have enough butter in them not to stick (parchment paper works better). I got 35 cookies out of this recipe.",
