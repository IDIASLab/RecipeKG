The pineapple caramel topping is essential--and made after the cake has cooled--so be sure not to skip it. While this may not be traditional in flavor or cooking method for an Impossible Cake, it's definitely a delicious variation and well worth the extra effort. Prepare ahead: this needs to cool at least 4-8 hours.",

It's one of the most scrumptious and moist cakes I've was ever successful in making.  It turned out of the bundt tin in perfect shape -- imagine my glee when I saw a perfectly shaped flan crowning this masterpiece! I didn't think it was possible! I made it exactly as set out in the recipe, except that I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. It's excellent even without the caramel sauce. I'm going to try freezing a piece without the caramel sauce and see how well it does. I don't think the flan will stand up to the freezing, but I'll try. Thank you for sharing this most unusual recipe. It's definitely one of my favourites.",
