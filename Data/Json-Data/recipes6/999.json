It takes way more than 30 minutes to do the second bake. It took almost an hour to brown the way grapenuts cereal (the brand) are. I kicked the temp up to 300.

I did what I usually do read some recipes and reviews then go in the kitchen and experiment with what I have. But I followed the basic formula and process of the recipe and it resulted in a cereal that tastes better than the store bought. To the recipe I added in some oat bran nutmeg and ground flax seed and subbed a cup or so of the wheat flour for spelt flour. Because I added a bit more dry ingredients and the recipe said to pour the batter (mine looked more like dough than batter) I added some water and a few more splashes of vanilla. I baked it for a while I actually had to leave the house so I shut off the oven and just left it in there till I got back. My meat grinder was grinding it too finely so I put the pieces in the food processor instead baked it up again and it came out great. Grape nuts is my daughters favorite cereal and she likes this better. It made enough to fill up two quart jars.",

I will make it again but will leave out the cinnamon. Also the grinding works better if the patty is torn into rough chunks and left overnight to dry a bit. Otherwise the grinder tends to smash the crumbs together into gobs. Also I used 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar plus skim milk to make the 2 cups of \"buttermilk\"",
