They taste pretty good, and I'd suggest giving the recipe a try.",

The sourdough starter I used was a sweet starter I would NOT use any other type of starter or your muffin will not be sweet enough. By using the applesauce the muffin becomes a little more dense in texture but worth it to lower the fat. Kids and hubby all liked them (made the mini size!). Will make them again.",
