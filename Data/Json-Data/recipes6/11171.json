The nuts at the bottom of the cake become soaked with the glaze and many people have told me that is their favorite part. If you like rum- you will LOVE this cake ! YOu can always cut back on the rum in the glaze a bit if you don't like a real strong rum taste. Most of the rum cooks off though, so don't worry about getting drunk by eating this cak.",

I only use Bacardi Anos rum.  It gives the cake a much richer flavor.  You should start cooking the glaze about 10 minutes before the cake is done.  I combine 1 cup sugar, 1 stick of real butter, 1/4 cup rum & 1/4 cup water.  Cook it for exactly 3 minutes.  Pull the cake out of the oven, and pour the warm glaze right over the cake while it's still in the bundt pan.  Make sure the glaze gets down in the middle of the cake near the hole.  Use a knife if you have to loosen the cake up a bit in that area.  Let the cake sit 30 minutes so the glaze makes it's way down.  At 30 minutes flip it over on the plate.  You will see that the glaze has covered the top and been aborbed.  Once the cake sits awhile, the glaze will become slightly crunchy.  This cake is suppose to be VERY dense and moist and I have never ONCE had anyone say it tastes like it comes from a box.  I only use Dunkin Hines Butter Recipe yellow cake mix.",

When I turned the cake upright onto a platter, I realized my mistake. I felt I should redeem myself by making more glaze for the top of the cake or no one would be able to taste the rum.  Well, obviously doubling the glaze is not necessarily a bad thing, because I had more compliments on that cake than any other I've ever made!  Several friends asked if they could take a slice home.  I refrigerated my leftover slice and had it the next morning with my coffee.  YUM!  I liked it even better when it was cold. Yes, I'll be making this one again.",

                "reviewBody": "I bought 1.5 oz pudding mixes because I didn't have this recipe on me to know what size so I just bought a bunch of the small ones. So I used two small packages of pudding (3 oz total) and even that was WAY too much. The batter is So thick! I was making a bunch of mini Rum Cakes so I wasn't planning on turning them upside down. Now I have to because the batter was so thick that the tops are ugly. No word on the taste yet. I'm sure they'll taste fine. But presentation was key for me this time because I was planning on giving them to co-workers as gifts for Christmas. LESS PUDDING! I'd make more with less pudding but \"The Rum's Gone!\" Planning on maybe cutting off the tops and turning them upside down? But I don't have pretty paper plates to give them out on... I'll figure something out.",
