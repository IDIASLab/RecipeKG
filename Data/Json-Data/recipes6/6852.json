I also used 1 cup of rolled oats in place of 3/4 cup of the whole wheat flour. The beauty of this recipe is that you can add in just about anything that can be mixed easily, and it will work. Used part rendered beef fat since I only had 3 strips of bacon. I wasn't up to rolling and cutting, so I just rolled little balls and flattened them to bake. You can pack them closely together on the baking sheet, since they don't expand as they bake. Remember to store in the fridge, as they don't contain preservatives and will get moldy in time. I feel good about giving these out as treats because they're all natural and I know exactly what went into them. My Westie, my daughter's mixed breed and her boyfriend's puggle will do back flips to get their jaws around one of these! Edited to add:No need to buy bacon. Save all trimmings from steak, chicken (plus skin,) pork,etc. in the freezer. When you have a handful or two, render (fry on low for about 15-20 minutes to melt off the fat.) Chop up the pieces left in the rendering pan and put them in the mix with the rendered fat. No expensive bacon needed. That's stuff you'd normally throw in the trash. You're recycling, AND your doggie will go nuts - promise!",

I increased the recipe size then added more fat and bacon. It was a hit! I refrigerated the leftovers and even froze some... thinking my dogs wouldn't eat them so quickly. They were gone within the week! I'm making more today at my dogs request!! Oh, I also wanted to mention that salt is not healthy for dogs so I'd advise omitting it from the recipe.

I tried them myself just to see what they tasted like and from a human perspective they were a little too floury and bland but I'm sure in the canine world it doesn't matter much! I didn't add the salt because the bacon has so much salt in it already but I did finely chop up 1 piece of bacon and added about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and I also flattened them with the bottom of a glass. And lastly since after tasting them I thought they were bland I decided to baste the top of each one with some leftover bacon grease like icing! Great recipe and in moderation the ingredients are not bad for your furry friends! 2/21/12: Made these again today and didn't have quite enough bacon grease so I added 1/2 smashed banana and left the rest of the ingredients the same. Came out great!",

She's even mastered the levers on my stand mixer which we used (dough hook) to mix it all up.  The dough was not greasy like I thought it would be, and we hand-pressed it flat and used bone-shaped cookie cutters.  They baked perfectly in 35 minutes, and somehow my dog knew these were for him when I took them out of the oven.  I am thinking about selling these at a farmers' market this summer!  Fun, fast, easy, kid-friendly baking recipe!  Thanks!",
