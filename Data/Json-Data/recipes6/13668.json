I put my rice and pine nuts through the food processor since I'm currently sans blender and liked the texture of the final mix so I think I'll just stick with that. I shared with a friend who kind of likened the flavor to something close to oatmeal. I'm not sure I quite agree - this is subtley sweet in a way similar to oatmeal but it's also something quite a bit different. I will definitely be enjoying this again!",
