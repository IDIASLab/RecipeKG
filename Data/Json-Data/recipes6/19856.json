I did not give it 5 because I TRULY like this stuff more on the tart side and have found the Strawberry Limeade on this site to be VERY difficult to beat. BUT with that being said I truly don't see anything wrong with this. It has NUMEROUS possibilities w/ customization! Add more lemon use less sugar vice versa and etc! I did the recipe to a T but mistakingly added a tad more strawberries (Fresh..didn't have frozen) than what it called for. Even just a little more altered the taste and the strawberry really overpowered it. SO..I had to juice another lemon (one lemon did yield JUST short of 1/3 cup as a PP mentioned). I ended up using ALL of that lemon juice as well. Perfect for us!:) I didn't think it was pucker-y tart..it was perfect the way it was! Lemon isn't SUPPOSED to be SWEET! I eye-balled the ice as we have an ice maker built into the freezer and don't use trays.....but using too much ice or too little ice could alter your the outcome as well....and you may have to adjust your ingredient amounts too! Totally would make this again! My 4.5 year old digs it..and if it makes HER happy it's gotta be good.",
