It took much longer for the cake to cook (at least 50 min in total) which may have been because of my substitution of the round pan. Unfortunately because it took so much longer to cook my company had to leave before the cake was even out of the oven! I will try this again though with a square pan. It is really wonderful with the apricots.",
