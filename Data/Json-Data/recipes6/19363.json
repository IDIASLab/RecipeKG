My main criticism would be that isn't as moist as some loaves I've made and the top turns out flat and a little crunchy rather than rounded and moist the way a lot of fruit breads do. It is good and chocolatey. I tasted it as soon as it was completely cooled and it was pretty good but even with tight wrapping it seemed dry the next day. The only modification I made to the recipe was to substitute dried montmorency cherries for the dates... I was actually looking for a recipe to use the cherries up when I came across this one. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract along with the vanilla. I still have no clue why the fruit is soaked with baking soda or why you leave it to stand 20 minutes before baking and I really don't know if those steps could be modified to the better.",
