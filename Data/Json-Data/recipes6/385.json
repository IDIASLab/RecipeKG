The only thing missing is that when you take the meat off the grill, you should wrap it in foil and let it rest for about 5 minutes or so.  You might want to reduce the temperature from 145 to 140 to take that into consideration.  The meat will have a pinkish shell because of the marinade, but the inside meat should be the white of pork.  This is a great one to grill for a party.  I have several times.",

We used an electric meat thermometer and cooked until it was about 150 degrees.  145 degrees is a safe temp but a little on the pink side for me. We let it sit for about 5 minutes before carving and It turned out PERFECT!  Juicy on the inside and nicely grilled on the outside.  Since there are only two of us we shared half with the neighbors\u2026they loved it too!  Perfect dinner for a warm fall evening!",

Due to the amount of sugar in the marinade, it is important to oil the grate and use a medium heat, as the submitter stated, or use an indirect method.  I think it would make a great sauce for chicken, pineapple and bell pepper skewers, too!",

(more like half that time for me) b/c I can only imagine how much more flavorful it would've been had it had longer to penetrate w/ that flavor. Halved the recipe for 1 tenderloin that was a little over 1 lb. for 3 of us. Wary of the cinnamon, but used it, and everything else, as directed. Delicious marinade that I'm sure would be just as good on chicken, pork chops, or cheap steak.",

I was happy to find that the marinade wasn't overpowered by the soy sauce. It was a nice blend of flavors of all the ingredients. I baked it uncovered  at 350 degrees because it was cold and snowy outside. When the meat hit 145 degrees, I brought it in to rest for 5 minutes before carving it.  As good as the oven was, I can't wait to grill it. I doubled the marinade, brought it a rolling boil for several minutes as a safety measure, and it provided a delicious sauce. Sliced the meat thin and served with rice. Delicious!!",
