I wanted to try some salads that were not so ordinary and routine and this salad really fit the bill! It is a beautiful salad with lots of color. (I used an orange bell pepper instead of the green.) Everyone loved it! And we were all pleased at the healthier choice it offered us over mayonnaise laden potato salad. Definitely a keeper! I'll make it again and again.",

I cut the recipe in half but then only used 4 red potatoes (instead of 7). I also had only 1/2 a red pepper I didn't bother to buy the other 2 colored peppers. I added the dressing and it was soaked up immediately probably because I didn't let the potatoes cool completely. Anyway I ended up making twice as much dressing just to get it going. Also added a splash of red wine vinegar it seemed to need it.",
