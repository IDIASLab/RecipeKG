I did have to drain off a little butter so I am thinking 2-2 1/2 sticks would be perfect. I also continued stirring until it reach temp. It was a huge hit and it tasted great.

I expected more melting but realized that it is not intended to be a toffee or a brittle. I would recommend warming the cookie sheet before spreading the dough out as it starts to set rather quickly. That helps. The rest is easy but I found that after cooling freezing helped everything somehow. It tasted good after it cooled but after freezing it really came together. Once you accept that it's not going to melt down into a liquid it works quite well and goes over well with the 'eaters.'",
