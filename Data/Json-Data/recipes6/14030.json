Knowing I'm repeating many tips already suggested, this is what I found worked well: Add 1/4 tsp vanilla and a little cinnamon to the batter, bake in an 8\" square pan or equivalent sized baking dish,cut butter down to 6 tablespoons, and sprinkle with sugar during the last 15 minutes of baking. Have fun with your favorite flavors of pie filling - all work well. Mmmmmmmmm, grandmas always were the best bakers, yours included, Jan!",

Next, cut the amount of butter down to 1/4 of a cup or less.  Using 1/4 of a cup of butter you will still get pools of melted butter on the top of the cobbler when you are done.  No worries though!  Simply spoon the butter onto the biscuits that have formed around the edges of the pan.  Make these changes and I think you will like this recipe.",

It was a good starting point I guess, but if prepared as specified, I think I would have been VERY unhappy with the results. first, I halved the butter called for, and found it to still be too much. I cut back on the sugar and it was still a little too sweet (and I used fresh cherries so no added sugar there). Putting it in a 9x9 was absolutely necessary; it would have been pancake thin in a 9x13. I added a healthy dash of cinnamon and allspice to the batter and it was very nice; I think if I hadn't done this it would have been pretty bland. So... this recipe can be a success only if you follow everyone else's advice about it. as is, no way.",

I used 2 tablespoons of butter, which (to me) was enough because the butter didn't gather in the middle.  I also used 2 cups of cherries, but I think it could of used just a little more, maybe a half of a cup more.  I didn't add more because I didn't have it at the time.  Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and a little bit of sugar on top, which made it taste great.  I also put it in an 8X8 pan.

It is WONDERFUL when you substitute fresh peaches that have had sugar, butter and a lot of cinnamon added to it and heated to boiling. You pour that over the batter and it makes an almost lacy topping when it rises to the top. This is so delicious that a friend's son had me make this for almost 100 people for the dinner the groom's family hosts after they do the wedding rehersal. I can only say it was easy to make and when served in martini glasses with a dollop of whipped topping it was elegant as well as delicious. Everyone should try this recipe with their favorite fruit. The fruits and berries in the grocer's frozen food case makes this a sinfully simple dessert that is sure to be a sensation after any meal. I should say that peaches are the only fruit you add cinnamon to, with everything else I add a little vanilla to the fruit when I heat it up. ",
