Next time I will cut the baking powder in half though. I could taste the baking powder too much. Other than that my husband and I loved this dessert. Tonight I reheated the leftovers in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and had it for dessert with vanilla ice cream on the side. I also sprinkled a little sugar over the Pudding Chomeur. My husband and I thought it was delicous. It's been about three days since I initially made this recipe and the leftover Pudding Chomeur was still great reheated! I will definetly make this again.",
