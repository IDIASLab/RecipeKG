They're very good that way and much healthier. I like to make them at holidays for breakfast. I serve them with Hashbrowns and fruit.",

If you don't have a steamer (rice cooker will work)-put the eggs in water, cover and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let set for 12 minutes then cool rapidly in ice water.",

I think the oil was too hot and browned the bread crumbs too quickly. I ended up just browning them in the fryer to get a nice even colored coat and then I baked them at 325 in the oven for about 50 minutes. After reading quite a few recipes I also added 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour to the sausage mixture to help the sausage adhere. Had no problems at all! Used 1/2 sage sausage and 1/2 regular pork sausage. Came out beautiful and YUMMY! Thanks for the great recipe Karen! Merry Christmas!",

You won't have to chase them around the kitchen when they come squirting out of the wrap when you squeeze. I LOVE this dish but make it very differently. I roll them in cracker crumbs for a softer slightly sweeter crust and I bake them on a broiler pan (two levels to trap the fat) so they don't sit in grease. Mustard of any kind is great however consider drizzling a little maple syrup instead. Yummy.",
