When they cooled they stayed chewy though so that was a perk.

I think I'll make these again without the pepper.",

I love to play \"guess the ingredient\" with my friends and co-workers and that is exactly what I did with this recipe. That being said do not be afraid of the 1 teaspoon of white pepper as most people didn't detect the 'heat' at all in the cookie. The only change I made was to refrigerate the dough and baked the cookies on parchment paper. A good chocolate chip cookie that is a little different from most.",
