One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.",

I was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport since I had to cover it but that didn t turn out to be a problem at all. The bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in. The only problem I ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough but I think that was more of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it. Why take responsibility when you really don t have to? I think next time I ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that ll tenderize the meat a little. Overall it got rave reviews and my fianc\u00e9e is still committed to me so I suppose this recipe was a win.",

The breadcrumbs are really the star of this dish because they taste great (the cheese gives them a lot of flavor) and they add wonderful texture.
