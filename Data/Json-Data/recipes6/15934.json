I know from having worked with past recipes, candy and fudge making, is that to get up to the right temperature to solidify at room temperature you would need to boil for several minutes.  In fact, I let the sugar/honey mixture boil (while mixing) for about 4-5 minutes.  I had no difficulty with these forming bars at all after boiling for longer than it stated in the recipe.  Although I found the recipe to have a rather strong honey taste my husband and children who are honey lovers really enjoyed it.",

                "reviewBody": "During a high-fiber diet phase, I went and bought a box of Kashi Heart Healthy something. (i can't remember the name, but it resembles Cheerios) Well, it was bland.. and this recipe helped me get rid of my extra cereal! I found a few ways to make it healthier. Because the cereal was already flavored honey, and because I ran out, I replaced the honey (other than a few tablespoons) with sugar-free syrup (it's so low-calorie!!!) Next batch I make will be with crunchy natural peanut butter (or the reduced-fat natural kind). I used 1/4 cup of the splenda mix (you're supposed to use half the amount) so it turned out fairly low in sugar and carbs, other than the cereal. The cereal made it HIGH FIBER (yay!) and the peanut butter also made it high in fiber and added protein and omega something. So, not only are these yummy, but they are lower-calorie and nutritious! These are one of my new favorite snacks and I will make them again and again.\nOh, also as soon as I made my first batch and was trying to press it into the pan it only filled up so I decided on the spot I wanted another batch. On the second batch, I didn't remove the saucepan from the heat while adding the peanut butter and it made the liquid darker and thicker (not in a good way) so I would recommend not doing that... I didn't have any problems making it into bars, and I think this recipe is great for making gross but healthy cereals edible!",

These are fantastic, and I don't even like honey!! I used wheatie puffs (think unsweetened Sugar Smacks. yeah, they're pretty bland), and boiled the honey mix for 3-4 minutes. I think I overdid it, though- the bars came out break-a-tooth-crunchy. But I found a solution (yaaay)! I covered a bar with a damp paper towel, and microwaved it for 20-30 seconds. Then I broke it up into bite-sized pieces and OM NOM NOM'd them good! SCRUMTABULOUS.\nEDIT: I boiled the honey/sugar mix for one minute (count 60 mississippis), and it was PERFECTLY chewy-- in fact, the bars stayed chewy for 2 weeks. YUM!",
