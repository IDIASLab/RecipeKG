Serve with steamed green beans and fresh crusty bread if you are looking for a winner to impress your dinner guests. This dish is so decadent it tastes exactly as though you ordered it at a fine Italian restaurant, but the secret is how simple it actually is to make! This sauce is also a wonderful accompaniment to pork chops, ravioli, or whatever strikes your fancy!  It is very versatile, so the possibilities are endless!",

It\u2019s taken me too many years to figure out how to make juicy tasty chicken & this recipe pushed me to try new skills. First, always pound your meant (pause for laughter). Next season well: salt, pepper, FRESH herbs, & whatever else floats your boat. I do NOT recommend cooking the chicken fully in the pan. Brown each side (for me it was less than 5 mins each side & that was with uneven sized chicken breasts, one of which was HUGE!). Then transfer to the oven (350^) or use a convection oven (been trying out my new Ninja Foodie air fry oven & no I\u2019m not being paid to say that). I set it to air roast for 10 mins @ 325 though it probably would\u2019ve been okay with 8 mins. Still came out juicy & super flavorful & I thought complimented my sauce well! Thanks everyone for the recommendations ~ I followed several & ended up having enough sauce to freeze, yeay!!!",

I reduced the amount of chicken to 2 small breasts (actually one whole 2 halves) but kept all other amounts as listed hoping to have excess sauce that i could use the next night in another dish. While the sauce was delicious we found it to be a bit skimpy for our tastes and if it had been served with something like noodles or rice I d think it would not be sufficient. Next time I d double all the sauce ingredients.",

I did use a little butter along with the oil to brown it. I felt initially that the sauce wasn't going to produce enough liquid to make a sauce or topping but it did come together. I would have seasoned the chicken in the beginning more and that is an easily rectified situation. We thought our dinner was very tasty and would make this again. Thank you very much!",
