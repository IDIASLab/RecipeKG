It became popular during War Rations because it didn't use eggs or butter.  Our family recipe calls for 2 Tablespoons of vinegar, 2 teaspoons of salt and 3/4 c. oil.  It makes a FANTASTICly chocolatey cake (and trust me, you can't taste the vinegar).\nIf you're making a layer cake, I'd use less oil, as the 3/4 c. makes a very soft and tender cake that won't hold up outside a pan.  We top our crazy cake with a boiled chocolate p'nut butter frosting (fudgy!) or with cool whip and a variety of crushed up chocolate candies...but it's way yummy just right out of the pan with nothing on it!",

Very plain one dimensional and simple. Don't be fooled by the name \"crazy chocolate cake\". The cake was not rich nor moist. In fact it took long to bake and even then it appeared uncooked in the middle (sort of like a brownie consistency but minus the chocolaty-richness). If someone baked this for my birthday I'd throw it at them.",

Yikes!!  BUT.. The second cake was AMAZING living up to every positive review I read... so my advice is to: 1. carefully follow the directions and 2. don't give up if the first cake is a dud.",

My family has been making Cockeyed Cake for 40 years and never had a failure that I can recall. THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF VINEGAR PROBABLY SHOULD BE 2 TABLESPOONS NOT 2 TEASPOONS! YOU MAY ALSO TRY 2 TEASPOONS OF VANILLA. I also think that the preparation instructions may be causing some problems here. The original recipes were 1/2 this amount and were mixed in a 9\" pan. THE DRY INGREDIENTS MUST BE SIFTED TOGETHER WELL BEFORE YOU ADD THE WET INGREDIENTS. You may want to do what the original recipes specified: Make three wells (one each for the vinegar oil and vanilla) then pour the cold water over all. When I make this I generally use a bowl to mix the batter rather than the baking pan. It is easier to get the batter evenly mixed. Also the vinegar activates the baking soda right away so it is important to get the cake in the oven immediately.",
