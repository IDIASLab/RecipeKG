Using a large pan,  cut the bacon in smaller, bite size pieces.  Cook bacon - put aside - cook onion in bacon fat until it starts to brown, then add vinegar, stir,add cooked fresh green beans or canned, add the bacon, season with pepper.  As a note:  I never added sugar - I might try that and amount of vinegar for your taste.  I prefer plain old white  vinegar with this dish. This is a good dish to make ahead because the flavor gets more intense.",

Then I sauteed the onions in the bacon fat. I used fairly lean bacon so there was not too much grease. I put the sauteed onions & bacon in the pan and made the marinade separately as the instructions call for. Leaving the beans to marinate overnight is THE BEST way to get a really good flavor. Fantastic recipe!!!",
