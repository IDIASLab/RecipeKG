The taste is incredible. Made exactly as stated minus the nuts--boyfriend is allergic. No frosting needed! Sprinkled powdered sugar on top, more for looks than anything else. Everyone loved them. Just had one, couple days later, and they are still NOMMY! Update: Made these again with 'help' from my 5 year old. Still super tasty! Just wanted to add that I used about 1/4 c margarine and 3/4 light butter with canola oil, did not notice a change in taste or texture!",

We added 2 tsp of freeze-dried coffee to increase the complexity of the flavor, and created a mocha sensation: they were sensational! Chewy, rich, and moist. I'd definitely make these again -- esp. given how simple they are! Much better than boxed! Our brownies turned out chewy, moist, and chocolate-y!  P.S.
