We love lemons and this is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. \"3 lemons\" is 1/2 cup of juice--you'll get a bit more if you microwave the lemons for about 15 seconds before squeezing. If you squeeze them too hard or press to extract the juice you might get some bitterness from the pith. A hand-held wooden reamer is best IMHO. I served it after it had cooled (just room temp) and topped with a dollop of Cool Whip and a strawberry. YUM!",
