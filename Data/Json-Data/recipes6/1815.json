My husband liked it also, but he asked me to cut back a little on the vinegar and add more peanut butter next time I make it. He's the one I made this for anyway because he likes peanut sauce. I adjusted the recipe to make 10 servings and the only thing I did different was just to cut back a smidge on the cayenne pepper since I am not a big fan of too much heat in my food. I cooked a 16oz box of spaghetti noodles and the amount of sauce for 10 servings was practically the perfect amount for it. I cooked chicken to go with it, but I think the noodles soaked up most all of the sauce before I had the chicken cut up so I didn't mix the chicken with the noodles. I think next time I'll cut up the chicken and mix with the sauce just before mixing into the noodles, maybe even make just slightly more sauce. Will definitely make again!",

I used it as a dressing for a quick Asian Noodle Salad loaded with linguini, red bell pepper, zucchini, cilantro, green onion, carrots, and chopped peanuts...it was delicious!  I put this together so quickly that I even forgot to heat it up.  Used my battery-operated whisk, and the brown sugar dissolved just fine. Made with pantry items that I always have on hand, I love that this sauce can be used in multiple ways.   Thanks Bonnie Gertz!",

I'd probably make it again with rice vinegar and maybe 1/4 of what the recipe recommends.",

I stir-fried some chicken tenders , pepper strips and julienne carrots, then added the sauce and some sliced green onions, served it over rice noodles. Rave reviews from the family. A couple  things I would suggest: first, that you only heat the sauce till the brown sugar dissolves, as directed. If you keep it warm on the stove, the peanut butter begins to go grainy. Second, I added only a 1/4 of the cayenne called for and there was still a little kick going on. Next time, I want to try adding some chopped  garlic and sauteing it with the  veggies for an extra flavor punch without the heat of the cayenne. Great recipe! Thanks for posting!",
