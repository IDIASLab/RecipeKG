It was very hard to make layers of batter and cranberry sauce. I would use more sauce...but the batter really needs to be thinner to work out right. It was tasty but I think I will have to keep looking because it was pretty hard to work with. Great taste though! Doubling the recipe did not work:( Took forever to cook!",
