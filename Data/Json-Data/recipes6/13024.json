I added about 1/2 cup each of chocolate chips, currants, and oatmeal to the recipe, and they turned out nicely, although I think they would be pretty good without add-ins, too.  One thing I really liked is that, due to the sourdough starter, the cookies rise nicely, consistently, and don't fall.  My starter was not sweet and made from whole wheat flour, and it worked fine.",
