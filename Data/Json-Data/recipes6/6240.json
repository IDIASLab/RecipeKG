I added some rosemary and thyme which really perked it up the flavor to delicious. Cooked the gravy down for about 15 minutes and it was still very thin so I did add just a bit of a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. I thought cooking the chops on a trivet was an excellent idea and I d never seen that before just makes sense to me. Doesn t seem to matter how I cook pork chops (even Heritage pork) these days it s just never tender and that again was the case here. So I just look at it as IT-IS-WHAT-IT-IS. With the modifications I made to the gravy these were OK but I m pretty close to giving on pork chops in general. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
