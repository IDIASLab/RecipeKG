My recipe only uses 4 eggs, which I beat with the sugar to dissolve prior to combining with the milk.  I also add a pinch of salt & about a teaspoon of cornstarch to stabilize it-whisk it into the sugar prior to adding to the eggs. Contrary to the name, never let it boil.  The protein in the eggs will coagulate and it will be grainy, or worse, lumpy.  For the same reason, use only whole milk, the fat is necessary. \nThe thin layer of foam on top of the custard will disappear as the mixture cooks, and when the texture and color are uniform throughout, the custard is ready and will \"coat the spoon\". Serve with a healthy dose of good bourbon.  Hope this helps.",

I don't live in a region where anyone knows what boiled custard is so this was my hope for the drink I grew up on at Christmas. After over an hour of constant stirring it finally started to thicken enough to coat the spoon although it was splotchy. The next day I tried the chilled bev. disappointed that it was very eggy tasting and lumpy. An approximate time to cook (i.e. \"It generally takes ME xxx min/hour to get the mixture to coat the spoon) would have been helpful. Also what constitutes \"coating\"? Sticking to the spoon like honey or just sticking to the spoon at all?",

I will say I had to make it twice to get it right. The first time I made scrambled egg custard which was disgusting. When the recipe says \"don't over cook\" that is important here. As soon as it started getting creamy I cooked it just a little longer. Its also possible to add a little cornstarch first mixed with water to give a little more creaminess. All in all it was great!!!

Next time I will cut down on the sugar a little, say 3/4 cup per quart of milk.  I also add a pinch of corn starch to the sugar/egg mixture.  The secret (or art) to getting perfect boiled custard is to heat slowly, stirring constantly (double boiler).  I continued to cook about 30 minutes after the custard reached 170 degrees F.  Total cooking time was about 90 minutes.",
