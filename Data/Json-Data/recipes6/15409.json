The biggest challenge was the crust--it was difficult to spread the crust on the bottom of the pan, and then later on, the sides.  I think it could have cooked longer than the suggested 70 minutes.  I know the recipe said cook until set, but I thought it was set at 70 minutes.  Would recommend this only to experienced cooks due to the crust factor!",
