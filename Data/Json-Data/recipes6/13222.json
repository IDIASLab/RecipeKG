It was from the \"American Woman's Cook Book\" which is an old 3\" thick green book that has seen better days but is still in my cupboard. The rhubard pie is just as good now as it was in 1938. The only hint I can tell you is to add a tablespoon or so of flour and one of sugar in the bottom of the pie crust before you add the filling. Mom said that keeps the crust from getting soggy. Now I have to go out and find some rhubarb. I NEED to make this again.",

Beat 3 egg yolk till pale yellow add 1 c white sugar 3 T milk. Beat until smooth. Add 1/2 c more white sugar and 1/4 c flour and beat until smooth. Add 1 T milk 1/4 c white sugar 1/4 t cinnamon 1 t vanilla. Beat until smooth. Stir in 2 1/2 c sliced rhubard (0.5 inch pieces). Pour into prepared pie shell (I used Baker's Secret Pie Crust from this site-- perfect!!) dot with 2 T butter. Cover with second pie crust. Brush with milk and sprinkle white sugar on top. Bake on bottom rack of oven at 425 for 10 minutes. Drop temperature to 375 and bake until crust turns golden brown approximately 40 more minutes. Watch the time carefully at the end because if you overdo it the top might collapse in a bit (and it just doesn't look as nice). Hope you enjoy this.",
