The beets are delicious and just different enough from my canned pickled beets that the change is refreshing.  The cinnamon is perfect. I made deviled eggs out of the eggs.  Very tasty, but next time I will leave any vinegar or lemon juice out of the yolk filling, as the outside has enough of that taste.  The deviled eggs were quite eye-catching!  Deep purple, fluffy yellow filling, green parsley sprinkled on top.  But you do need to pickle them about 4 days for the eggs to \"purple\" all the way through to the yolk.  To use fresh beets:  Wash beets, leaving roots intact, and cut the tops, leaving two inches at beet.  Barely cover with water, and simmer till tender.  Drain. Cool, and slip the skins off the beets.  Slice as desired.  You will need about 1-1/2 cups sliced beets and about 1/2 cup for what would have been in a can of beets.",
