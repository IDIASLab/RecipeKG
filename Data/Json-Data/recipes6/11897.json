Both versions came out but I did have to vary the cooking time and I found that filling the muffin tins too much was a problem that resulted in brownie like rocks. I personally was not impressed but my roommate just loves them. Fiddle with the bake time as you see fit. Worthy of Five stars overall for ease and taste.",
