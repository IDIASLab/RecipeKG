Also added molasses, and used between 4-8 Tbs. water instead of eggs.(Didn't measure the amount of liquid. Just eyeballed it. I needed the extra liquid b/c I also added one large chopped apple, and 1/2 c chopped almonds.)  Substituted almond milk for the milk, and used Rumford's non-aluminum baking powder. I omitted the raisins and used a handful of dry cranberries instead. Omitted the brown sugar topping, and added more cinnamon, as well. \r\n \r\n\r\n",

I often double the recipe and bake it in an 11x14 glass baking dish (using 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar).  You can easily mix this up the night before, cover with plastic, stick it in the fridge, and simply bake it in the morning whenever you wake up.  NOTE: To avoid breaking my cold glass baking dish by placing it in a hot oven, I put the cold dish into the oven BEFORE I turn the oven on (that way the dish and the oven slowly heat at the same time).  If I'm baking this oatmeal staight from the fridge, I'll increase the baking time a bit (about 45-50 minutes for a single recipe or 60-75 minutes for the 11x14 size double recipe), otherwise I use the time given in the recipe.  Mmm-Mmm!, great on a chilly morning!",

If you think you don't like oatmeal unless it's baked try making oatmeal in the microwave with milk (whole - or add some cream to your skim) instead of water and then stir in a dash of salt and some brown sugar. Top with fresh berries (whatever you have on hand) cinnamon and a little cardamom. This is much healthier much faster and in my opinion tastier. I would still do the baked version for a crowd because you can make many servings in one pan but for every day try it in the microwave as described - healthier and better.",
