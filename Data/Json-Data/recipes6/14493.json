                "reviewBody": "I tweaked this recipe. It is truly wonderful on a cold winter's day. I call it Eastern European comfort food.\n\nI parboil my cabbage leaves by placing them into boiling water for one minute. I then shut off the fire and leave them in the water, taking them out one bye one to stuff each leaf. They are not too hot to work with but this is a necessary step to allow for easy and pliable rolling.\n\nIn a large bowl, I put 1 and 1/2 lbs of lean ground beef, unflavored bread crumb about 1/2 cup, 1 cup cooked rice, 2 beaten eggs,1/2 fresh green pepper finely chopped, half a small onion finely chopped, 1/2 cup golden raisins,zest of a lemon (for extraordinary freshness), 2 beaten egges, salt, pepper to taste.\n\nMy sauce is started in a seperate pot-  in 1 Tbs olive oil Sautee half green pepper, 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped add two cans of tomato sauce to one can of tomato puree, Juice of one fresh lemon, 1 Tbs of sugar and 1 cap of white vinegar. cook for about 1/2 hour. \n\nPreheat oven to 350. In a large baking pan ladle some sauce on bottom. Tightly pack your cabbage rolls into pan, you'll get twelve rolls into a large pan. Cover them with a bit more sauce. Cover with foil and bake 1 and 1/2 hours. It is a lot of work but worth it. If you are like me you'll love to be in the kitchen on a cold day cookin' away! Enjoy.\n\nTip- If I have leftover meat and cabbage, I cook it in a large pot (the one the sauce is already in) making meatballs from meat mixture- I drop meatballs in raw to sauce",

I had no idea what this was supposed to turn out like, as I have never had stuffed cabbage before, but my family adores the ingredients in this so we though we'd give it a try.\n\nI wasn't certain if I was supposed to cook the ground beef or not because the recipe didn't say, so I erred on the side of caution and prepared this with it cooked. \n\nGarlic powder 'to taste' is not enough information for someone cooking this for the first time. I like garlic, so I added it liberally. It was still not enough. Again, not knowing what the flavor was supposed to be in the end, it was frustrating.\n\nThe picture shows thick hearty sauce over the top, but it made no sense that that consistency could be achieved from just vegetable juice, vinegar, and sugar. But I trusted the recipe and positive reviews and made it how the recipe dictated.\n\nIn the end, I had a sort of tasteless watery tomato soup with cabbage pods submerged within. It needed salt, badly. \n\nI will not be making this again.\n\nHowever, I will be making an extremely loose adaptation with a robust marinara or spaghetti sauce and chunky veggies; and lots of garlic, onion, salt and pepper in the filling.",
