I pretty much followed the recipe except I did not add the last tbsp of butter at the end. I thought that was just overkill and I didn't miss it at all. I was a little bit leery of putting a whole habanero because habaneros are no joke when it comes to being hot. I just put a smallish one and it was perfect. These onions would also be perfect on hamburgers. Make sure you don't slice the onions too thin because they'll dry out and be tough. You want nice strips so that they will caramelize well. Thanks for posting this Doug and my tummy thanks you too!",

After years on this site this is my first review, I was compelled by how delicious this is and the fact nobody else (other than the author) has reviewed this yet... word of this secret deliciousness needs to spread.  My wife, who hates onions...I made her try a bite and soon she was eating up my onions off my plate.  Thank you for this recipe, very easy and so delicious!
