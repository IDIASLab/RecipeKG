The next day they had gotten soft (of course b/c of the amount of butter and the cranberry spread), which isn't bad, just a preference thing. And heck, throw some ice cream on top and I'll be saying texture smexture ;-). I will make these again, but will reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.",

Could not taste the spices in the crust, so added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the cran mixture after thickening and still can't taste it but perhaps by tomorrow it will season.  The cooking time was spot on in my oven.  I couldn't let them cool completely because I was too impatient to try.  They were still warm but did not have any problems with crumbling or falling apart. *I also took care in not letting the cranberry sauce touch the sides of the pan during preparation.  This prevented the sugar from crystallizing as it baked and sticking to the pan and becoming hard. They cut perfectly into little squares.  They are sweet so they can be cut into small squares.  I only had a white mix and used that and cannot taste any cake mix flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe with alot of versatility.  I would like to add a bit of orange zest to the next batch.",

I ad libbed a little (it is in no way a reflection on the original recipe, it's just what I do...).  I added about a cup of ground pecans to the dough.  On top of the cranberry layer I added a handful of white chocolate chips (would have liked to add a few more but someone had broken into the bag and a handful was all that was left!), and I also added about a cup of shredded coconut before adding the top layer of dough.  Delicious and festive cookies that I am looking forward to serving at our Christmas party tomorrow night!  Thanks for a great recipe.",

To the cake mixture, decreased butter to 2/3 c, 2 eggs, and used quick oats(didn't have rolled), only 1/2 c br sugar, 2 t. cinnamon, no ginger. Then use the butter wrapper to press down the dough mixture into the pan (it won't stick) and use wrapper again to press the remaining dough into flat pieces to place over the cranberry mixture. 35 min was perfect in my oven. Cool completely and it will cut beautifully. Great fall dessert.",
