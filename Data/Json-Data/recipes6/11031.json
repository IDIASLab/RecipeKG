No one could tell what the \"special\" ingredient was until many hints were made. I boiled pinto beans in just water until it had absorbed almost all the water and mashed roughly. I added dried pears to the mix and toasted walnuts. I replaced 1/4 cup of white flour with graham and used two egg whites instead of one. I made the glaze from a tablespoon of milk, a cup of powdered sugar, and some lemon and orange zest. \n\nI'm making another cake now, but, because I ran out of ingredients, am substituting a lot. We'll see how it goes -- I'm replacing 1/2 cup of white raisins with guava fruit rolls, half the flour with graham, and 1/4 of of the pinto beans with azuki (red) beans. I also added a bit of nutmeg and more cloves to the recipe.\n\n\n\nNote that standard toothpick test does *not* work on this recipe because of the beans. I initially undercooked the cake and discovered that when I started cutting in. Bake for the full time, even if the top starts to crack. I served the cake upside down -- the nice golden brown, even surface was easier to glaze and so pretty.",

However, it doesn't raise noticeably in the baking so you end up with a bundt cake that is about 3\" high.  This tastes almost exactly like my apple cake though so not a recipe I'd add to my collection.\n\nFor those who complained that the cake was a bit 'heavy', perhaps you used too many beans?  The recipe calls for 2 cups pinto beans, mashed (meaning you measure the beans first, then mash them)...not 2 cups of mashed pinto beans.  This will make a difference.",
