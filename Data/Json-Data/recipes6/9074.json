As I was mixing together the spice blend, I was thinking it was making an awful lot and that there was a ton of salt since lemon pepper seasoning is already salty as is...but I went with it.  On the two chicken breasts, I only used 1/4 of the seasoning I had mixed up because there was so much of it, and it still came out too salty.  The amount of seasoning as written would be enough for about 8 breasts.  I highly recommend you only make a half batch at most, and leave out the salt - only sprinkle some on at the end if needed.  I used 8oz breasts and they were done at 10 minutes. The onions were starting to burn, so keep an eye on things. I do like broiling chicken though, as they tend to come out juicy (assuming you don't overcook them!).",
