I'm not sure I understand the point of wasting 8 sheets of foil when you can cook the beans all in one packet, unless your guests are insisting on each having their own packet?  Even with one large single packet, the beans were more than done after 12 minutes, with the lid closed and flipping every 2 to 3 minutes. Cooking them 20 minutes would turn them completely soft and a muddy green, overcooked color.  If you like them al dente, you might even start checking after 8 minutes. A simple recipe with easy cleanup!",
