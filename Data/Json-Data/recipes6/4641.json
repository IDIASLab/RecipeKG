                "reviewBody": "This was a good base recipe but the cooking times are very off in my opinion. I hate overcooked veggies. I would make the following changes. Cut down to 1 C of broth, the veggies create a lot of juices which were not completely absorbed by the time the quinoa was done. Let the quinoa simmer for 10 - 15 minutes before adding your mushrooms, zucchini, etc. I would also add the garbanzos at this time. I like adding a cup of quartered cherry tomatoes as well. Simmer for about 5 more minutes. Increase spinach to 3 or 4 cups and add at the end of cooking. The spinach will wilt from the heat of the dish. Adding a few shakes of crushed red pepper adds a nice little bit of heat too.",

I think toasting the quinoa was an inspired idea it really gives it a nice flavor. Thanks Crystal",
