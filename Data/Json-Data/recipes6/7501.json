And drain the pineapple really well and the ham needs to be blotted if from the package or pizza will be too wet. Also do NOT use a big square cut slice of ham.. slice in in thin strips or again won't blend as well. Just my tried and all that experience. But very quick and very easy to make and oh so delish.",
