This is my new obsession. I knew they would be great when I swiped a lick of the bowl after I tossed them into the oven.. the seasoning mix alone was yummy. I followed the recipe but used chili powder (no chipotle powder on hand) and I used foil instead of parchment paper (suggestion: spray the foil! I didn't and they stuck a bit!). I forgot to set the times and took them out when they were tender (no clue how long!). they were firm and nicely roasted on the outside and creamy on the inside. They do have a tiny kick of heat but it's balanced by the sweet of the brown sugar and potato. These are fantastic!",

For Epicure users I used 2/3 regular chili powder and 1/3 Epicure chipotle chili powder because it is so potent. Good amount of heat for moderate spice people.",
