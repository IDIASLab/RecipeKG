I did not put it under the broiler to finish; it was finished just fine.  I think if I do this again, I will set the timer for only 18 minutes, and then finish the loaf under the broiler.  I also was not a big fan of the balsamic in the glaze.  I think it would have been better with about 1/2 of the vinegar and adding 2-3 Tbls. of brown sugar....which is what I will use next time.",

My meat came out done on the ends and sides middle was extremely rare. meat thermometer read 110 when we took it out of the broiler. Rather than wait for the pot to build up pressure we put it in the oven at 350 until the internal temperature said 160 about 25 more minutes! Unlike another person who said there's wasn't done due to his/her total meat weight being 2.25 instead of the 2lbs called for mine was exactly two pounds (I've noticed at Wally Mart the 1lb packages are marked exactly one pound the two lb packages are marked 2.25...not sure about other stores). Would also like to know what fat ratio the author used to see if that makes a difference. My beef was 97/3. I was surprised at how good it tasted after it was done. I've never put apples in my meatloaf before. Other than the apples and the topping it was identical to what we usually make (we only use ketchup on the top...not a fan of BBQ sauce on meatloaf which is what ketchup mustard and brown sugar give you). I'd give this five stars for taste and three for not enough information so four it is!:-)",

I halved this recipe since I live alone and followed it to the letter (as I do with any new recipe......I can always tweak it next time).\nThis was AMAZING.......I have a small, high side pan that came with my air fryer and I used that in my 3 qt. Instant Pot and set it for 40 minutes and put 2 red skin potato's in with and let it go.\nWhen it was done I released the pressure, took my potato's out for mashing and drained the \"liquid\" in my meatloaf pan.  I mixed the sauce for the top but added a bit more sweet for me and put it in my oven and let the top \"dry out\" and put the sauce over it and let it set.  Sliced, plated and ate and I loved it.  I was shocked about the apples but I could not detect any apple flavor and I made my own breadcrumbs from crusty bread.  Basically, this is the first \"GOOD\" meatloaf I have made in a long time and I am making this AGAIN!  THANK YOU for posting this.  \nOH!  I put foil over the meatloaf in my IP and placed the taters on top if that helps anyone.",
