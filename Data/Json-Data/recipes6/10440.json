I didn't change a thing only using pecans instead of walnuts and I'm so glad I made the recipe as is ignoring other suggestions and substitutions by other reviewers. This is just delicious prettily specked with the red cherries and brown nuts and flecked with the coconut. So different from the same ol' banana bread and a nice change. It's moist and flavorful with a real comfort food quality about it. Set your timer at less than the full hour--my loaf was done at 50 minutes. You can always add more time but you can't undo it!",

I had never actually timed it but I did so today and I am at 50 minutes and I'm just now greasing the baking pans.now maybe you already bought your walnuts chopped so that would save you some time But just chopping up the cherries and measuring everything out takes at least twice as long as 15 minutes and if you include greasing the baking pan you'll add more time. I double this recipe and make it in small baking pans to give as gifts and it will make eight small loaves if you double the recipe. And I bake it at 25 to 35 minutes with eight mini loaves. It's always a hit even if it takes much longer to make then what is noted here! ??",
