GREAT balance of ingredients. The boys made quick work of this sandwich stuffer--they LOVED it. My husband asked me why I hadn't made it before and please could I make it more often........and why aren't there leftovers? ;)",

Plus it was quick and easy to put together for lunch - not to mention a bit healthier than fried chicken wings! I used Kraft Reduced fat light dressing and of course Frank's Red Hot which is a staple in our house. I cut back on the celery a bit but it did give the chicken salad a nice crunch. I let it chill for about an hour before serving to let the flavors blend together. I made these into wrap sandwiches - perfect with crisp lettuce fresh tomatoes and of course some crumbled bleu cheese! Thanks for a great recipe Nikki!",
