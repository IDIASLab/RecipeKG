One tip: You really need to salt the cucumbers before making the rest of the recipe to draw out excess water. I don't salt ANYTHING but I won't skip this step with this recipe. For all of the reviewers who ended up with too much liquid, I think this is why. I used 2 english cucumbers, sliced them thin and then sprinkled one tablespoon salt over them and covered with plastic wrap for 2 hours. This will sweat out excess liquid that can be poured off before proceeding with the recipe.  It is absolutely unnecessary to boil anything -just pour everything over the cukes after salting and let set in fridge overnight. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. Wonderful!",

For those who like a little bite,you'll have to use more vinegar,for those who don't,use more sugar. I actually had to double both. I found that if you add the DILL into the water,vinegar,sugar mixture when on the stove, it has a better taste and mixes better. Also, adding salt and pepper to the cucumbers and onions BEFORE the mixture is a MUST. That small change makes a world of difference to the taste.",

The person who recommended using an english cucumber hit the key!!  We wondered what was different about our recipe than the person we were trying to copy and that was it!!  BUT... normal cucumbers also taste great, I just could tell a difference.  Then the person who said for 1 cucumber, 1/2C white vinegar, 1/4C sugar, 1/4C water, sprinkle salt lightly after you've sliced them, and then 1/2t dill got it right!  With 4 large cucumbers,, I'd definitely double the liquids or there would not be enough liquid to soak this all up.  I always omit the onions!  I think you have to kind of know what you're about to make to really appreciate this recipe b/c before I had this... this would have tasted and looked gross on paper.  I knew what I was looking for, so there were no surprises.  It's our favorite!  ...or at least my husband's.  It's my favorite just b/c he thinks I'm the best now that I can make his mom's \"secret\" cucumber dish ;)  His mom also does the salt with a T in Tupperware for 2-3 hrs, rinse the 2/3C+ of water you'll have left, and then continue with recipe.  Also better to marinate overnight.",

I only used 1/2 teaspoon of dill as someone else suggested.  That seemed perfect.  If I do add more cucumbers next time then I will probably use more dill though.
