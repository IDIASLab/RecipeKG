These cakes make a great gift and are usually a big hit at every holiday dinner party. This cake is super moist with the soaking glaze. I remember mom always making this on Christmas Eve for our Christmas dinner but to our surprise dad always cut into it first thing on Christmas morning once he discovered just how good it really was. It became a tradition of ours from then on to have a slice while opening our Christmas presents. Sip a fine cup of coffee or your favourite tea with a slice of this and you will be pleasantly surprised at just how splendid this really is. Thank you Staceyo for helping me relive some wonderful family memories of some long past Christmases. I'm ready to bake some more",
