I also used half&half milk for a richer taste. This recipe is the old-fashioned version of short cake. It has a taste very much like scones. I hope these suggestions help others - put all your dry ingredients in a bowl and use a whisk to blend the ingredients. Have your butter at room temperature. I used a wired pastry blender to mix - the texture will be \"fine\" & feathery - not coarse. Make a well and add your wet ingredients and combine just until they come together. As with any biscuit recipe you don't want to over work it or your dough gets tough. I \"floured\" my hands with confectioner sugar and separated my dough into 8 equal mounds -then rolled each mound in the powdered sugar and fashioned into a biscuit. I allowed an inch around each biscuit as they will get larger as they bake. This recipe will make 8 \"catshead\" (large) biscuits. For the BEST whip cream - use heavy (or whipping) cream - to 2 cups heavy cream add 1 tsp. vanilla ext. and during the whipping add 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I made 55 shortcakes for a ladies lunch - Big Success!",

I took the advice of some other reviews and used 1/4 c. sugar in the batter, used 1/2 c butter instead of the shortening, added vanilla to the batter, and used 2 1/2 tsp instead of 4 tsp of baking powder.  Instead of a whole cake, I made individual sized cakes (like big biscuits) and baked them on a greased/floured baking sheet for 12-13 minutes.  I even sprinkled each of the mini cakes with a cinnamon & sugar mixture!  We then prepared them as the recipes says!  Such a hit and so easy to make!",

I cut the baking power to 2 tsp like other folks and upped the shortening to 1/2 cup as I wasn't getting the \"course crumbs\". A local farm makes and sells terrific shortcake bicuits when their strawberries come out in June. This cake is exactly like those biscuits and I can have them anytime! I had no problem with crumbling maybe because of the increased shortening. As for folks substituting butter and adding vanilla try it according to the recipe first. The problem I've found with many \"shortcakes\" is that they try to be center of taste and just end up overpowering the finsihed product. Also I have no 8\" pie pans but I do have an 8\" spring-form pan. Worked out great. This is a keeper! Enjoy!",
