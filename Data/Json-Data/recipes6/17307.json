I pressed that amount into a 9-inch tart pan and my cheesecake came out perfect. I used about 2 tablespoons less sugar in the cream cheese mixture and it was already sweet enough. It was quite difficult to get the \"marbled\" look because there was too much of the chocolate mixture. I would suggest mixing at most 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup of cream cheese mixture with 1 ounce of melted semi-sweet chocolate and swirling it into the rest of the cream cheese mixture.\n\nOverall, it was yum!",

Yes but so is the boxed cheesecakes as well. This is a thin cheesecake that would thus make it too thin to be a cheesecake. Putting half of the cheesecake with the chocolate mixture is way too much and does not allow for a good marbled affect. I enjoyed reading the various methods of trying to create this affect. Once again too vital a piece of this recipe to have to alter. However it tastes good except for all the crust.",
