Unlike some others, I find it too sweet for my tastebuds so I cut the sugar in the crust to 1/4 cup (or less).  Also, I've tried it with 2 whole eggs instead of 4 yolks.  I separated the eggs, beat the whites and folded them in before baking. Same taste - just a bit lighter. Finally, why not use the lime zest since you're using the limes? Nevertheless, however you tweak it, a fabulous recipe.",

However one suggestion - I thought the baking soda flavor came through too strongly using the recipe so I halved it in the second pie and that was perfect. Also I never did get the \"foamy\" result of whipping/stirring the baking soda with the other ingredients listed. Works well with either lemon or lime zest. I think the flavor is best with some whipped topping (Cool Whip) on top. Try it the crust is excellent and the overall result is addicting.:)",

As you can see from my photo the crust puffed up huge; by the time the thing was out of the oven it was more crust than filling. While the crust was tasty I think it would be better for cookies; once refrigerated overnight it was very difficult to cut. The filling was not bad at all maybe a little tart. I made it exactly as stated juicing 2-3 limes and straining them into the measuring cup and also happened to have lemon peel on hand. I added green food coloring because the yellow didn't look very appetizing. So the flavor wasn't bad overall it just looked funny with a huge crust with a little puddle of filling in the middle. Next time I'll use some of the crust dough to make a small pan of cookies for the kids and the adults can have the pie.",
