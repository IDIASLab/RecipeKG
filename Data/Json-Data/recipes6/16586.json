The changes I made were to increase the persimmon pulp to 1 1/2 cups and the water to 12 tbsp. I did not use a bread machine and divided the bread into 2 pieces and baked them in 3 1/2 x 6 inch pans at 350 for about 30 min. While eating the toasted bread I thought that nuts would have been a great addition!",
