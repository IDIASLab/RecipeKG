I knew I wasn't very good at rolling stuff out. So I tried rolling them into balls and then rolling them in cinnamon sugar. Came out yummy. Even if you roll them in cinnamon sugar you don't need more than the 1/4 cup you make in the recipe. I think next time the only thing I would try is rolling them into balls and flattening them slightly. Rolling them made 54 cookies. But that isn't necessary just something I might try.",

What I do like about it is that it calls for the seeds instead of extract which mellowed the anise flavor making it appropriate for everyday eating with coffee or tea. The sugar-cinnamon topping definitely adds to the cookie and gives it a nice crunch but also removes somewhat from its buttery-ness. I also made a few with some nutmeg added to the topping and it was a nice addition.",

When your getting ready to bake them put the Anise seeds on your board and run over them with your rolling pin a few times it will release more of the licorice flavor. and then you can run a sharp knife through them to chop into fine pieces texture is better that way. I shaped the cookies into the double S shape in the picture. you can glaze them or dust with powder suger too.",
