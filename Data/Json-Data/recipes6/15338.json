Maybe if you used milk chocolate it wouldn't be as bad. I did like the rice crispies in them. It was different but it didn't make these cookies as unique and unordinary as I thought they would be. One hint when they come out of the oven after 10 minutes they really appear to be raw. I found that after sitting on the pan for 5 minutes and then cooling down that they did firm up but I still ended up baking most of them for 12 minutes and prefered the end result of those ones better. I might make these cookies again but i will definetly be cutting down the chocolate or changing it to milk so they are not as rich.",

I took the advice of another reviewer and halved the choco chips but used Cocoa Krispies instead of Rice Krispies. Something seemed to be missing and it wasn't sweet enough though so added another 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup chocolate syrup and 1/4 cup peanut butter. The cookies came out pretty tasty then. Liked that about the recipe that it was so easily adaptable to taste and creativity. Would make again.",

Also like others have said the Rice Crispies added a different texture than expected less crunchy and instead more chewy than I thought they would be.",
