My grandmother always made it with the salad dressing, but I prefer it with regular mayo(not lowfat.) My recipe is a little different: I use 1 cup \"warm\" water and 2 teaspoons of baking soda instead of half soda and have baking powder.  I made this cake last night for my family.  They love it served warm with whipped topping.  A little trivia: The Original Chocolate Mayonaise Cake recipe was made with salad dressing and the recipe was always printed on the jar's label.  I don't know when it was converted to regular mayo just know that is how my Mom made it.  I can hear my Mom and Gram arguing now over reg. mayo vs. salad dressing.  haha!",
