We like our cookies a little stronger flavor... My husband was eating them as fast as I could get them off the cookie sheet.. I frosted them with White Frosting from the can that I bought from the store and flavored it a little with the anise oil... They were so good.. This is a keeper... I will be making these all the time.. They turn out so pretty.. They are going to look nice on a cookie try.. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us.. It's wonderful. I can't wait to make a cup of tea and have cookie's..",

I love the fact that they are just perfectly sweet. These are not a cake like cookie but just like a stella doro due to the baking powder. They do not spread and therefore can get alot on one sheet. I didn't have anise extract so ground 4 tsp. of anise seed in my coffee grinder and it was just perfect! I think I would prefer the real anise seed anyway. Nice to get a little crunch of a seed for a burst of anise flavor. Thank you for this lovely cookie as a great addition to my holiday trays! UPDATE 12/23/10 I just have to say that these are so wonderful. I make them every year and just took a batch out of the oven. again i use extra fennel/anise seed that I grind in my grinder as well as a bit of anise extract. I also use parchment paper. makes alot and u can't stop eating them!",
