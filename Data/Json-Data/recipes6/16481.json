I followed the instructions exactly and the only change I made was a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar on the top before baking.  If you like pecan pie but find it to be too rich then I encourage you to try this one.  It is very similar in flavor but not nearly as heavy and rich as pecan pie.  In fact,the next time I make it I'm going to try it as a base for a pecan pie.  It couldn't be easier to make and the ingredients are very inexpensive.  All I had to buy was the buttermilk.  And don't worry if you hate buttermilk (as I certainly do) you won't even taste it.  This is a very creamy, sweet, and highly addictive pie!",

Not only is this recipe easy its wonderful. I took the advice on some reviews and reduced the amount of sugar. My crust didn't burn and I even left it in the oven 10 minutes longer to brown the top some more. The top is crunchy and mixes well with the gooey inside. This is so good! I really didn't know what to expect but I am pleasantly surprised. It is really sweet and has a wonderful after taste. I can't wait to take this work I am sure everyone will love it.",
