I m definitely going to make these for gifts and such since they make a pretty presentation and it s something that will stand out from the usual butter/sugar/spritz/chocolate chip cookies. They look like something you d have to get at a specialty bakery and are very yummy. Because I like chocolate I made one change to the recipe and that is I added two Tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. I took a chance and added the cocoa the first time I made them since there was a comment that this recipe was too sweet. I figured the cocoa would be a good counter to the sweetness and I like dark chocolate anyway. On my opinion it was a very tasty move. I always enjoy reading helpful hints from other s reviews so I hope someone else will find this suggestion useful. Next time I make these I think I will use special candy making chocolate (the kind that hardens back) so that the cookies are less messy. (Although melted chocolate on your hands isn t all that bad a thing!) I prefer dark chocolate so that's what I used. I also used parchment paper but I imagine release foil would work just as well. I agree with other s suggestions about the cooking time. I made a few trays crispy and a few chewy both were great. Just pay attention to the level teaspoon of batter and the space on the cookie sheet or else you get a giant blob of stuck together cookies. Ha",

I was using my fancy pants thicker aluminum cookie sheets and they weren't cooking/spreading fast enough. Switched to my flimsy cheap nonstick cookie sheet (still with parchment) and viola! Perfect browning on the edge and reduced cook time. Use a little more than the recommended teaspoon. In the bakeries these aren't so \"holey\" and are a satisfyingly sweet and sticky cookie. Lastly give them a little smoosh before baking since they don't spread enough on their own to make a flat thin cookie. Don't flatten them completely but don't leave them as round balls either. Thanks for the recipe! This NY'er has Italian cookie fever in MN:)",

Even with heavily greased foil (and in a second attempt a heavily greased nonstick cookie sheet) these cookies were quite difficult to get off the foil / pan (I tried removing them immediately after coming out of the over). To be fair several of the cookies did come off the pan / foil with only partially broken edges but to me any breakage is unacceptable. I bake constantly and have never had this much trouble removing cookies from a pan. I think another reviewer mentioned \"chiseling\" them off... sounds about right to me. I tried cooking them for 5-7 minutes then 10 minutes as per other reviews. Neither time really yielded a good cookie. I was looking for something thin crispy buttery and delicate. These ended up being chewy candy-like brittle and fragile. I really had high expectations for these cookies and I am by no means a novice when it comes to baking. Sorry these were not at all what I wanted and I will not be making these again.",
