With the rust I omitted the Tbsp. sugar and used walnuts only because I could not find any pecans in my grocery store without the chemical BHT in them. Then I used 2 pkgs. cream cheese and added 2 cups REAL whipped cream with only 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. Yum! Now for the topping I mixed 3/4 cup sugar with the 4 Tbsps. cornstarch and added 2 cups organic peach juice (not made from concentrate)instead of the water and cooked that until thick. Meanwhile I sprinkled 2 Tbsp plain Bernard Jensen gelatin over the remaining cup of peach juice to soften the gelatin. Then I poured the hot over the cold juice and added 6 large sliced peaches. I covered it and chilled it in the fridge. O man was this good!",

The combination of the Jello filling and fresh peaches absolutely hits the spot. Way to go TARA! I only changed a few things. I doubled the amount of sugar in the crust for a little extra sweetness. And used more peaches (8 instead of 5). I also liked to just dollop some fresh whip cream on the top as opposed to cool whip. Good eats!",

I found that the peach layer didn't set up completely could be that it didn't sit in fridge long enough or i didn't cook long enough. This recipe works well with lemon pudding and pie filling instead of the peached(skip the jello step and make 2 packages of lemon pie filling awesome) the only change i made was i used chopped almonds and 2 tbls of sugar instead. the other thing people could do with the cream cheese layer is use 2 pkg of cream cheese 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of whip cream that works very well. will definitely be making this again we also try with different fruit as well thanks again",

We loved it even though it seemed to take a long time to make (the cooling of the crust and the jello mixture and then waiting for the jello to set up). The only changes that I made were walnuts instead of pecans and I used less sugar. It was plenty sweet after cutting more than 1/2 cup of sugar from the jello layer. I will probably use more cream cheese next time only because I love that layer the most. The fresh peaches make this dish so cool and refreshing for this time of year.",
