Its not real pretty to look at. I supose you could add some purple food coloring. I am thinking about making some marscapone or goat cheese whip cream and reduced lemon drizzle to fancy it up a bit.

So moist:)........just made this again, still cutting in half and keeping the spice measurements whole. Found this stores very well for several days in Tupperware on the counter. The spices seem to get stronger as it sits and a taster and I both thought that it tasted like a cross between a fig Neuton and gingerbread. Was good warm with some Haagen Dazs, too.",
