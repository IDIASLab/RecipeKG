Trust me with this one- check after 30 or 35 minutes of cooking. When LIGHTLY BROWNED take them out of the oven. Let them cool till warm (about 15 or 20 minutes) and slice. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and lay pieces on sides. bake for 2-3 minutes on each side. Cool completely. Trust me-this seems like they would be undercook but theyre delicious when theyre slightly underbaked. if not theyre too cakey. so underbake them by 5 minutes or so...TRUST ME!! ENJOY!",
