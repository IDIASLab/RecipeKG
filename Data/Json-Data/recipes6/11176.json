I was quite liberal in my use of rum and actually added more than the 1 cup of rum soaked raisins called for (additionally I soaked my raisins in rum for several days) but no rum taste was discernible in the finished cake. I would describe this as a snack cake. It is moist and mildly spiced not overly sweet yet does not require a frosting or glaze. It is relatively healthy for a cake and makes a good lunch box addition or simply a nice snack for the kids. It is not an exceptional recipe in any way.",

Maybe it is in the original form but use this twist: Use a full 1/2 cup rum to soak raisins. Also use this to glaze the cake fresh out of the oven: 1/4 C butter 1/4 C Sucanat or Turbinado sugar 1/4c (or a tad less if you prefer) rum. its fantastic. i also use a half and half Sucanat- turbinado sugar mix for the cake itself.
