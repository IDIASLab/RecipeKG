I always use the fresh cranberries, and I use dried cranberries in place of raisins.  My neighbor has asked me to bring this bread to her holiday open house - it's fantastic!",

I heated the OJ and then put my cranberries and golden raisins in this to let them soften.  I then added the butter and beaten egg to this mixture (the butter was already soft and melted in this warm mixture) and mixed well.  I added this mixture to the dry ingredients and poured into 2 pans and baked for 40-45 mins (must check, but they came out perfectly baked in my oven in 44-45 mins).  Smelled fabulous and tasted even better.  No crumbling at all.  This procedural change is from a different recipe on this site, and worked very well here (and I don't like cutting butter into dry ingredients, anyway).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

Quick breads are like muffins you do not want to mix too long just until combined. I stirred in cranberries and walnuts (some family members have issues with raisins) by hand. Mine baked up in about 55 minutes. Very moist very flavorful bread.",
