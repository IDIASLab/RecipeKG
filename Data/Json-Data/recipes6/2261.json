I used only all-purpose flour (because I didn't have any wheat flour on hand), and skipped the raisins (as the kids don't like them in scones). Other than that, I followed the recipe, including brushing them with the optional egg white wash before baking. I did add a caramel/cinnamon drizzle on top (powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp caramel flavoring and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, thinned out with a few teaspoons of milk to get the right \"drizzle\" consistency). Thanks for the recipe!",
