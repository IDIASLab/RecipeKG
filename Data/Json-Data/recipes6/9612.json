I had 10\u2019 tortillas on hand, so I doubled the filling (using cream cheese), and 50/50 frozen blueberries and fresh raspberries (made 6 burritos in total).  Didn\u2019t have to double the cinnamon sugar mix, and I brushed on the avocado oil.  I had to air fry mine a little longer until both sides were lightly browned.  The burritos came out nicely and the flavour was creamy, a little sweet, lightly tart.  Didn\u2019t eat one until it was completely cooled off, so the burrito wasn\u2019t crispy but still good.  A good recipe for an easy dessert.",
