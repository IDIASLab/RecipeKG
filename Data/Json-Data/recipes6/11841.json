The reserve liquid was used to break up the brown sugar. I also cooked agreed with the idea of cooking it at 375 for about 10-12 minutes.

It claims 3 dozen cookies but in reality makes about 1 and a half dozen. This is a very easy recipe that is great for making with small children and the subtle flavors are great for kids younger than four years old (since they are often sensitive to strong flavors) although my own principles force me to soak them with artificial rum flavor versus actual rum. All in all it's a good enough cookie.",
