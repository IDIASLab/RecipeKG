This is my go to recipe for muffins -they always get rave reviews and everyone asks for the recipe. I substitute whole wheat flour for half the flour called for. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla for a little more flavor. I have also made this with strawberries and they are great. Seriously, thank you so much for this recipe, I make it ALL the time!! (The batter also freezes really well)\n9/19 - update. Still my favorite muffin recipe. I no longer soak the oats in the orange juice, I just mix all the dry ingredients, mix the wet and then incorporate the wet into the dry and add whatever fruit I want. Finely chopped candied ginger and nuts with the blueberries is a great combo.",

After the orange juice and oatmeal had a chance to sit for 10 minutes, I stirred in the white sugar, vegetable oil and egg. Once those were combined, I folded in the dry ingredients and the blueberries. I did get 12 biggish muffins out of this recipe. I baked them at 350* for a little over 20 minutes. These looked very pretty and were moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. The flavor that the orange juice gave to the muffins was a nice addition. My family enjoyed these muffins, especially slathered with butter.",

A number of reviewers said that they halved the amount of baking power just by intuition.  Well, I guess there is science behind it too!",
