But my boyfriend wanted to try some because we have been doing weight training and black beans have so much fiber without the load of carbs in bread. we both don't like peppers or pimentos, so i just left them out, and i used canned beans instead of dry. The trick to canned beans is to pick the low-sodium variety with the most spices already in it. (More flavorful beans, the usual is salt sugar and dehydrated onion, but if you can find canned beans with more than that they're even better!) I used two cans, drained, and DIDN'T ADD THE 5 CUPS OF WATER!!!! this is very important, as a few reviers have mentioned their beans came out watery. The water is to soak the dry beans in, and then to be drained off. If you need some extra liquid while cooking the beans, add a little chicken broth. (Or vegetable if you're vegetarian) :) It turned out -so- good, i'll be making them often! Thanks :)",

I had to simmer it forever to even get it close to not looking like soup. Now perhaps this isn't the case when you use regular beans and/or perhaps this is how soupy it's supposed to be. Regardless next time I'll use at the most 2 c. of water if not less. Also this could use a few more spices; I increased the black pepper and added cayenne pepper.",

I made them a day ahead because I think that beans like chili always taste better the next day. For those who had issues using canned beans dried beans are healthier tastier and have a much better texture than canned. You do not need to soak overnight. Boil the beans in water for two minutes and then let them sit for one hour. Drain rinse and continue on with the recipe. I will use these as a vegetarian filling for tortillas as well as a side.",
