One thing that stood out to me was the carrot/celery ratio. Most all recipes call for half the amount of celery but this one was equal. I love celery in my chicken soup and this was the perfect ratio in my opinion. There is one minor thing I will change the next time I make this. While the cauliflower rice held together okay, I would have liked it a little less done and will wait to add it next time. Still giving this 5 stars because it is an excellent soup.",
