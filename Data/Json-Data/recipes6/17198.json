The only consistent issue I have is that the sauce needs nearly twice as much liquid to make it \"spreadable\" which is fine and the crust does not taste \"cooked\" in 20 minutes. I made this again yesterday and I find that when the crust is \"lightly browned\" it's not enough cooking for the crust beneath the toppings. When I reheated the leftovers for 20 more minutes @350 the crust became the perfect texture. I love this recipe though so make it your own.",

I was under a big time constraint so I took some shortcuts by using a prepared alfredo sauce (already in my cabinet) and then I grilled the chicken breasts using the George Foreman grill to expedite things. Even though you don't let the dough rise in this recipe it still made a nice crust. The combination of the rosemary and thyme seasonings (along with the green onions and mushrooms I added) gave this pizza a \"gourmet feel \" and it really impressed my family who came home & thought that I had bought it from Papa Murphy's!

I also made the pizza with sauted spinach as a topping along with the chicken and it was so good!! I'm going to make this as an appetizer as well and make it in a 9x13 pan or a jelly roll and cut it into small squares. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
