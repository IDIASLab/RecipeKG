I have tried so many recipes for crust and my Irish mother would always tell me \"Butter flour salt and water is all you need \" but I wouldn't listen. Mom knows best! The filling is great too as it doesn't have too much spice to it (some apple pie recipes are drowned in cinnamon and nutmeg and you can't taste the apples). Since I go to the orchard to pick mine I want to be able to taste them (that's the only thing I do differently with this recipe-- I don't use Granny Smith). Thanks so much for submitting this!",
