I make it every Christmas with sausage crepes. I've made it lots of times and I cut back the sugar to at least half of what the recipe lists. It has lots of natural sweetness and the extra sugar is really not necessary. Also it must be taken out of the freezer at least 30 minutes before serving or it will still be totally solid.",
