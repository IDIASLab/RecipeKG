With the second batch, I increased the sugar by about two tablespoons, kept the nutmeg the same, but added ground cloves and cinnamon.  I also increased the orange zest to one teaspoon.  Second batch was outstanding.  The result was still not a very sweet filling, but flavorful, different and generally a very easy to make dessert!  Beware that the recipe calls for making three inch tarts.  If you are using the pre-made phyllo dough tarts by Athens, they are just over an inch in diameter.  Therefore, if you double the recipe (or triple, as I did) you will have much of the batter left over.  (So, I baked it into a pie - a bit different, but yummy!)",
