My daughter and I like to eat cookie dough (we SAMPLE it! It has to be good dough to make good cookies!), so it's nice that I don't have to worry about eggs. Oh, I also used parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets. It took them about 12 minutes in the oven, and they were a thicker, softer cookie. The ginger was a nice addition. One bit of advice to people complaining about 'cakey' cookies: Substitute some (or most, or all) of the baking powder with baking soda. Most chocolate chip cookies have soda but not powder, and think of what they turn out like. :) Thanks for sharing, Lucille!",
