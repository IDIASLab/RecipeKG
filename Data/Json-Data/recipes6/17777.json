The only problem with this cookies is that while they're delicious the first day they don't keep well beyond two days. Some ideas: for less greasy cookies change to 1/4 C butter and 3/4 C shortening and for variation try adding chocolate chips.",

I would give the recipe 5 stars if it were all about taste but I have to say they were kind of a pain to make. The dough was VERY dry and crumbly and there's no way you could \"drop batter\" by rounded teaspoons onto the cookie sheet -- i had to scoop up crumbs of dough and smoosh it into a ball and then VERY CAREFULLY flatten them so the balls wouldn't just crumble. It's definitely more effort than I'd normally want to put into cookies but I have to say that the end result was terrific: very pepperminty and not bland at all and I am having a hard time not eating the whole batch in one sitting! Oh and one other thing it only made 3 dozen not 4 dozen but maybe I made mine bigger than I was supposed to.",
