I will make this again. Thanks.",

I replaced the chicken with a can of chick peas to make it vegetarian and diced up a green pepper instead of using the corn because that is what I had on hand. We prefer these kinds of salads with lots of red wine vinegar so I added quite a bit more than the recipe calls for. I also added some diced up fresh parsley because I wanted to use it up. Delicious!

I could see using water chestnuts in this also for crunch. My co-workers were all jealous when I told them what it was and were surprised it wasn't takeout. Will definitely make again.",
