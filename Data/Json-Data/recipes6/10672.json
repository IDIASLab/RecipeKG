I've made some changes that make it even yummier and easier to prepare. I can't find masa harina so I always use all-purpose flour. Instead of water I use one 8.5 ounce can creamed corn. I don't bother processing the thawed corn -- it's perfect just thrown in. Also, I mix everything in one bowl -- much less mess and it turns out just as delicious.",

Instead of 1/3 c of sugar I used 1/4 c Splenda, perfectly sweet enough.  I used 1/3 c all-purpose flour plus 1 T cornmeal in substitution of 1/3 c masa harina.  I used canned corn, which I did pulse in the blender with a little cream, though I don't think that is necessary if you don't want to do so.  I would have used creamed corn but I didn't have any.  I baked it in an 11X7 b/c I thought that fit into the 13X9 water bath easier.  Turned out just the restaurant...probably healthier though.  Will make again, probably double the recipe though so the pieces are thicker.",
