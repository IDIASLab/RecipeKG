If it is too hot inside your kitchen things tend to react differently. AND if you kept working with the dough your hands may have congealed the butter more and made it more liquid within the cookie. If it's hot in your kitchen and you are working with things like this it's best to keep the dough in the fridge and take out little bits to roll while you make them. Hope this makes sense!",

They were not like what I've made before at all.  The cookies flattened out in the baking so that they weren't balls at all and they were too salty.  If you do make these, I reccomend rolling them in sugar twice: once when they're hot out of the oven and again after they've cooled.  The first layer gets rather pasty from the heat, but soaks into the cookies very well.  The second layer sticks to the outside for a nice look.",

Roll the cookies smaller than you think you should.  The recipe says it makes 48...I can get 110 out of it.  They turn out so much better the smaller they are.  I also toast the pecans before I put them into the cookie.  Also, roll the cookies in powdered sugar right when they come out of the oven and then roll them again.  The first coating gets kind of sticky and then the second coating makes them perfect.  Make these cookies...you won't regret it!",

First off, the dough absolutely needs to be chilled prior to baking.  Second, the oven temperature should be 350.  I tried this, and the balls were perfect. Lastly, use unsalted butter when baking with a recipe that calls for salt.  Using 3/4 teaspoons of salt and salted butter will make the cookies too salty.  This same dough can be used to make crescents, or if you don't mind them spreading, they make a very tasty cookie.",
