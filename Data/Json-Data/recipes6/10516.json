I doubled the recipe cut back on the white sugar added 1/2 C brown sugar and it gave them a wonderful bronze color and flavor! I omitted the lemon zest and instead simply added Vanilla Extract. I increased the amount of banana as well using 4 large ripe bananas. I also added extra walnuts for more protein content. All in all I will probably be making this recipe again. Thanks!",
