The cookies turned out quite nicely with a somewhat cake-like texture and crisped edges. Make sure you give them plenty of time to cool before serving. They were a huge hit! I ate mine with a bit of natural peanut butter to add a little protein and saltiness to it as that's my personal preference. If you also prefer a slightly salty and sweet cookie I would increase the salt by a quarter teaspoon.",
