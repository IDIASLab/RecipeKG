This was the first time I tried this recipe;  a lot of the cheese oozed out of the meatloaf, (I need to learn how to \u201croll up\u201d the burger better) and the bacon on top didn\u2019t cook through.   I put it under the broiler for a few more minutes and that did help cook the bacon.  Clever idea on \u201cweaving\u201d the bacon!\n\nThank you for sharing an awesome recipe!",
