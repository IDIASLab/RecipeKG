The sauce was runny when I first took it out of the oven, but it thickened while it cooled.  I used plain water instead of vegetable broth, and it was still delicious.  The only thing that would deter me from making this again would be the amount of prep time involved -- the best way I discovered to get around that is to multiply the amount of filling you prepare.  I make one pie immediately, then divide the rest into the right portion sizes and freeze them.  The filling freezes wonderfully, and it's so easy to defrost, put in a pie crust, and stick in the oven!",

In addition to what is listed, I added: shelled edamame, peas, garbanzo beans, broccoli, spinach, extra mushrooms (shitake and cremini), and 3 to 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also threw in some extra garlic and some Herbs of Provence for flavor.  I used a whole wheat pie crust just on top.  Thanks SO much!",

The veggies I used were red skinned potatoes, parsnips, green beans, carrots, onions, portabellas and shiitakes.  Other than the veggies, the other change I made was I added a little thyme and ground sage to the filling, and a little extra cornstarch.  Make sure to bake the bottom of the pie crust for about 10-15 minutes  before you add the filling so the bottom of the pie won't get soggy.  This was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.",

                "reviewBody": "The taste of the pie was delicious, no complaints there!  The sauce was pretty thick when I made it, but when I put the pie together and cooked it the following day (after refrigerating it) it turned out extremely runny.  I actually had to drain the liquid from the pie and as a result the base turned out soggy.  I used cornflour, as I think this is the Aussie equivalent for cornstarch.  Maybe I should have used more.  But I want to try this again one day, I can imagine it will be worth it!",
