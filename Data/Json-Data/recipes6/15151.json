If you decrease the salt by half and use a generous tablespoon of sugar (instead of only 2 tsp) - this is great!  Fortunately I tasted the dough before pressing it into the pan - and added enough extra sugar to still use it for my pecan pie.  Came out fantastic!    Since pecan pies typically bake for a long time, I didn't bother baking the crust and it came out cooked through after an hour and a half baking.  Rating four stars because  this produced a very simple and quick alternative to rolling out a pie crust - and if enough sugar is added, is very tasty!",

But I gave this recipe a try and I am absolutely ecstatic to have found such an easy recipe that turned out so well!  It was tender, flaky and flavorful!  My crust was for a quiche and I used olive oil as another reviewer here suggested.  It turned out fantastic.  This is a keeper for sure and I am saying goodbye to Pillsbury crusts!  Thank you so much for a great recipe that will definitely save me time and money in the kitchen.\n\nAn update on my original review - I healthied this recipe up a bit by using 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour plus 1 cup of white flour and it turned out great.",

I've used it as a cobbler crust, top and bottom layers of fruit pie, even cut up sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It's so so good! I do agree with past reviewers that if you're making a sweet dish, use only a pinch of salt and up the sugar quite a bit. If you're making a savory dish, like a quiche, leave the recipe as is or cut the salt just a bit. Otherwise, this recipe is IT!!!",

I chill the oil first and then mix in the milk before I add to dry ingredients in pie pan.  For a double crust use  2 cups flour, 2 t. sugar and 1 t. salt. Increase oil to 2/3 cup and cold mile to 4T.  Save 1/3 cup of crust to crumble on top.  Fill with your favorite filling and top with crumbs.  Bake at 400 for 15 minutes and reduce to 350 for 30 - 40 more minutes.  I always get raves for my pie crust.",

This is a fine recipe when you're in a pinch but when I have the luxury of time and a special recipe I would go for a real crust. That said my husband and son didn't mind it at all for my homemade pot pies. (For the tops I pressed the dough into rounds on WAXED PAPER and then picked it up and turned it onto the pie - very easy.)",
