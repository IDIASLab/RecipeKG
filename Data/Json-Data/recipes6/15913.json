I usually don't care for marinades that are heavy on the soy sauce, but I was impressed how well it turned out.  We used low sodium soy sauce and a lighter shiraz, which helped and the molasses flavor is subtle and really, really good.  Brown sugar would have been great here too.  Just that little bit of sweetness from the molasses added a nice crust from the grill on the outside of the meat and it was tender and perfect on the inside.  We also did another tenderloin with straight bbq sauce just in case we didn't like this marinade, and there was a ton of the bbq tenderloin left over and none of this one!!!  A sign of a great recipe!",
