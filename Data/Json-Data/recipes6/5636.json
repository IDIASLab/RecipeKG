All you have to do is heat some oil in a pan and fry the bell peppers and carrots. Once they are semi-tender add the corn and tomato until the veggies are as soft as desired. Meanwhile, add the cilantro, mint, oil and balsamic vinegar (I needed double oil/vinegar than what the recipe said) and let it sit until the quinoa is cooked. Once it's ready, add it all together and you have warm quinoa vegetable salad!",

Omitting tomatoes and onions makes it safe for a GERD diet. Don't like cukes? Use zucchini instead or brocolli stem and all, or dress it up with asparagus. Coriander would make a nice addition. Herbes de Province or  basil works for me to vary the dish. Thanks.",
