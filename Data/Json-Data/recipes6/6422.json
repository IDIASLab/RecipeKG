It gave the chicken a nice creaminess but it wasn't so much that all of the other flavors got lost. Even the 15 minute bake time was spot on. The tortilla's were perfectly browned and the cheese perfectly melted. The tortilla's I had on hand were much bigger so mine were more like burritos but same principle. I've made similar recipes in the past but this one has them all beat. Thanks for sharing!",

I used the recommended amount (3/4 cup) and it was hot!  My first batch of taquitos were barely edible due to the heat. I like mild heat. For my second batch, instead of using a spoonful of chicken I did a small layer of the chicken and a ton of cheese (approximately 4:1 cheese to chicken ratio) and they were AMAZING!  Next time I make it I will dramatically reduce the amount of Wing Sauce so I can have more chicken in each taquito.  \nI used a convection oven. I kept the 425 degrees temp but the cook time was reduced to 8-9 minutes. No need to flip for browning purposes, but if you don\u2019t flip them the cheese runs out as it melts.",
