I've tried several variations of this and other similar recipes (\"Overnight Blueberry French Toast\"), and this is my family's favorite: Cut eggs back to 9-10, and add 1 tsp. vanilla to the egg/milk mixture.  Six to 8 oz. cream cheese is plenty.  Spreading the cream cheese on the bread before slicing is a great idea if you have family members who aren't fond of cream cheese - it's less visible.  Otherwise, cut into small dice no bigger than 1/2 inch (a little messy, but much better than the 1 inch squares suggested in other recipes). It's critical to sprinkle cinnamon (I like Pampered Chef's \"Cinnnamon Plus\" spice blend) on both the bottom and top layers of bread cubes - the cinnamon could be added to the egg mixture as well, but I would still sprinkle extra on top.  For the sauce, use only about 1-2 tsp. of cornstarch, especially if you prepare it ahead of time - otherwise the sauce becomes too thick.  Reduce the sugar to 1/4-1/3 cup, and add the juice of half a lemon for a little zip.  Tip: Be careful not to use too much bread -- the dish can't \"puff up\" if all of the cubes aren't sufficiently saturated. Also, as much as I love the sauce, the dish is equally good and maybe even better with real maple syrup. Enjoy!",

Used homemade white bread and frozen rinsed blueberries (that's all that I had on hand). For my 3 servings I did use 3-1/2 oz. of cream cheese 2/3 cup blueberries and 1/4 cup chopped pecans in the refrigerated mixture. (Spread the cheese over all the slices of bread before cutting them into cubes.) For the sauce I increased the blueberries to 1/2 cup and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Only had time to chill this for about 2 hours. Baked it in an 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch glass loaf pan. VERY YUMMY!",
