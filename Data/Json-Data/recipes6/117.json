First problem is the flour & egg both really need some Creole seasoning. I cut the sauce recipe in half and it was still too much for 1 lb of chicken tenders. The sauce was a little too sweet but has great potential. Thanks for an inspiring recipe. I will have fun tweaking this to be perfect for our taste.",

My husband didn't like it becuase it was like eating chicken with our sweets instead of eating sweets with our chicken. my daughter and I give it all thumbs up however.",

I also found I only needed half the amt. of flour listed. I found the sauce amt. perfect but I'm going to dbl. the Cajun seasoning in that too! Another idea I might try is breading and baking the strips (skipping all the frying & grease!) adding the sauce for the last 15-20 min. Like someone else mentioned this is a great recipe & experimenting with it will be fun! Thanks so much for posting.:)",
