They baked for 25 min at 375.  Came out just perfect.  I used Pillsbury's cream cheese icing to frost them.  It's milk and egg free too.  Who would have thought?  Thanks so much for this recipe.

She was on an iodine-free diet for cancer treatment and so excited to have cake on her birthday.  I took my first bite nervously, but it was actually delicious!!! The combination of the frosting (which tasted marshmallow-ey) and the chocolatey cake ended up tasting like a sophisticated moon pie!! The cake was very moist, and the frosting went well with it.  I would consider making this again for a birthday cake.  I made two 8-inch cakes and turned it into a layer cake. Yum.  Thanks for the recipe!",

It did rise very nicely but I found the taste rather bland. It lacked a lot of sweetness and chocolate flavour for me. \r\nI think I will try this recipe again but changing it up a lot, for example add banana, like one reviewer suggested.
