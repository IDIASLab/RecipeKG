Cook untill the cookie returns to the surface and turn over to finish cooking. The cookie should not be brown! Second a pastry wheel will cut the cookies and allow you to create a diagonal line across the middle and flip one end of the cookie through the hole to create a cookie which looks like a belt buckle and the shape will provide a hole to hook with a fork when you lift it out of the lard. Swallow to dry your mouth and blow the excess lard off the cookie before placing it on a flat piece of a brown paper bag to finish draining and to cool. The cardamum will taste better if you store the cookies in a paper lined sealed container for at least a week. The cookies will maintain their texture there also.",

Also if you add a tablespoon of whisky or other alcohol they will not absorb the oil as they cook. My mother always used vegetable oil and never lard. My mother's recipe used more eggs and the amount it made was dependent on the number of eggs used. The reason that they are called Fattigmand Bakkles (poor man's cookies) is that they contain ingredients that everyone could afford.",
