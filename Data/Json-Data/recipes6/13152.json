If I would have had time I would have made a batch with Lime jello which would have been very pretty next to the strawberry. Oh well next time. _____________________________________ 12/19 Just wanted to add a note. We enjoyed these fresh from the oven the day they were made but nobody would eat them after a day or two of them sitting. The jello taste was so strong and fake tasting that they did not go over well.",
