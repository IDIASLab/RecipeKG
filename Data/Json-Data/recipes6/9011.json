Love the lemon flavor from the juice, and I could see adding the zest of the whole lemon, but just won\u2019t deal with the chewy lemon rind again.  I used my best olive oil (which I typically reserve for salad dressings), and I think it made a difference in the outcome of this dish.  I like the harmonious blend of ingredients, and the first thing that comes to mind is what a fantastic side dish this would be to some roasted or grilled fish.  In this house, this recipe would be four servings, but maybe my bell peppers were just large.  Fabulous eye appeal (red bell peppers would make it pop even more), fresh flavor, and I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.",
