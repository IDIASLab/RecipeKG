I hate the rolling, I hate the crumbling, I hate the chilling, I hate everything that makes sugar cookies what they are. I'd only make them when I couldn't get out of it. And my 6yo DS has the most convincing big brown eyes. Anyway, this cookie has made me a convert. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't need much chilling (1/2 hour to 45 minutes does well for me), the texture is GORGEOUS and doesn't get dry or sticky between rollings. I actually make these willingly. I'm making 3 pink batches, one for each of my kids to take to school for Valentines Day. I'm using the Easy Valentine Sandwich cookie method from this site to make them sandwiches (along with the frosting). I think they're truly fantastic. Laura, you ROCK to have restored my faith in easy cookies.",

Don't waste your time with the fake stuff, you will be disappointed after all your time spent. I also use 2 tsp. not 1 tsp. as called for. Try them again--Chill overnight, use PURE vanilla, and double the amount of vanilla.. This is the easiest dough to work with and the taste will be much better.. (also, make sure you beat the butter and sugar for at least 3 minutes, add eggs and beat for another 3 minutes.Add flour mixture and mix only till incorporated in, don't over mix)",

My mother is diabetic and was 107 after eating them. I also live on the east coast and found that in my electric oven using 335 degrees for about 18 - 20 minutes gave me more control on how they turned out. I also switch the pan on the bottom with the one on the top rack. It makes them more even. Finally (not the diabetic ones)I frosted them with a sugar cookie frosting from this website.

The \"scraps\" we rolled into a ball and chilled in the freezer and then rerolled. I will be using this one again! Thanks!",
