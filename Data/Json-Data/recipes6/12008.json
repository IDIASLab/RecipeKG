I did leave out the cofee and cinomin because I just wanted brownies.(Oh I also did half brown sugar half white) These are so moist and fudgy just like I like them. If you like cakey brownies these are not it. If you want a rich creamy fudgy chocolate dream of a brownie look no further. Oh and make sure to let them cool in the fridge before you cut them or they will crumble. I also halved the recipe and baked in a 7x11 pan and it worked great.",
