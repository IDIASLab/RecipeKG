The only thing I changed was substituting an entire individual serving cup of applesauce (unsweetened) for the margarine and decreasing the sugar to 2 cups (and i could have even decreased it even further without it hurting the cookie).  However, once i mixed the dough, i realized that i had used rolled oats instead of the quick cooking oats (they were the only ones i had) so i let the dough sit in the fridge for a while so that the oats could absorb some moisture and soften up.  I then baked them (using a smallish ice cream scoop) and they turned out so soft and delicious.  The first tray was undercooked a little, but they had such a lovely melt-in-your-mouth texture, that i wanted the underbake the second batch too, but that one happened to bake perfectly, darnit.  But it was still soft and delicious, just not as tender.  All in all, a great cookie.    ",

These cookies are great if made correctly (DO NOT ADD FLOUR to these. It will be a whole different final product)!  In 34 years I have never seen one of these as big as a dinner plate.  The best way to make these are to drop by heaping tablespoons(serving, not measuring) or from 1/4 cup measuring cup (packed).  Then only slightly press them down to NO LESS than 1/2 original heigth. Also for variety try M&M's (plain or peanut) instead of chocolate chips and/or chunky peanut butter instead of creamy.  The raisins are also a good idea.  You will LOVE them!!",
