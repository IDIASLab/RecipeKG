The directions are pretty close to hers only she covered the edges of the pie with a crust cover or foil to keep them from burning. For someone like me to make this pie and not fail it's pretty much foolproof. Very comforting. I serve it with whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream Grandma was big on eating a slab for breakfast in a bowl with milk/cream. I suggest you make your own crust to make it even more decadent.",
