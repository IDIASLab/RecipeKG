I cant say enough good things about it -- everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe! Considering the fact that my dorm is in Germany and most people had never heard of eggnog (and were a little suspicious when i explained what it was!) that was the highest compliment! I used whole milk instead of half and half and Schlagsahne (german for whipping cream) for the heavy cream. I think the scotch whiskey (which isnt always added to eggnog) also gave this drink a particularly holiday-ish punch. Prost! Well done!",

Don't be tempted to speed up the cooking process at the beginning (making the custard). Keep the heat low & stir constantly until it's thickened slightly. I didn't add the ice cream (it was sweet enough without) and used part whole milk & part single cream because we can't get half & half in the UK. I also only used rum as is the tradition back home. It was delicious and everyone loved it - and most of my friends had never tried eggnog before - by far the best eggnog I've had.",
