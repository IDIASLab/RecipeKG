You may think that you don't need the space but once the cookie starts to spread it will go farther than you imagined. The first time I tried it, I had uni-cookie. It will also be soft-ish when you take it out of the oven, but will harden to a lovely texture when it cools. (I substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar.)",

                "reviewBody": "Yum!  These were alot easier than I expected.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting a bit of the flour with some oats I ground very fine with my coffee grinder.  I just used my 1tsp measuring spoon to scoop out the dough onto the baking sheet.  Even using the spoon I found that it didn't take much dough to vary the size of the cookie from about 2 1/2in to 3in in diameter.   If you really want uniform cookies I suggest filling and leveling off the spoon size of your choice.  Definitely leave the cookies on the pan for a few minutes to harden before moving them somewhere (like a cookie rack) they can cool completely.  If you stack them warm they can stick, so beware!  I used alum. foil, shiny side down, with a light spritz of canola on my pans and it worked like a charm.  The foil made it easy to manipulate the cookies up without breaking them and the oil minimized sticking to the foil.  I was even able to wipe off anything that had stuck, respray, and reuse my foil a few times before it tore and needed replaced.  The cookies themselves are very delicate, crisp and tasty.  They can get a bit crumbly around the edges, but I hope to remedy that when I sandwich them with a little chocolate later today.  They definitely will benefit from it, both visually and taste-wise.  My single batch made almost 7 dozen cookies, out of which I will get about 3-4dozen sandwiches (give or take some \"sampling\").",

My favorite variation: After the cookies have cooled Melt some semisweet baker's chocolate and put a spoonful on the bottom of a cookie-- then sanwich it with the bottom of another cookie. The chocolate acts as a glue and they become sandwich cookies. Delicious! However make sure that your cookies cool totally flat for this to work.",
