My dough was a little on the dry side and hard to work with so next time I would try 2.75 cups of flour and see how it is then before adding the full 3 cups. I started out with chopped almonds and ended up using VERY VERY finely chopped almonds! Just chopped them even smaller in my food precessor so they really coated and stuck to the cookies. Will make again for sure! Thanks! re-reviewed 1.22.09 - I made these again this past Christmas and added in Raw Sugar (the large brown crystals) with the ground almonds. It was fantastic. It did make them a bit sweeter and crunchy. I like them both ways.",

You really had to grind the almonds very fine for it to stick well. I had leftover almonds so I made the recipe again but did the egg paste. It really was not that messy! And the cookies looked exactly like the picture because the paste was able to grab on to the bigger pieces of almonds and to the festive Christmas sugar crystals. In the end the cookies did taste the same but the 2nd batch had more of a crunch...yummmmm.",

I had no idea what kind of almonds to use so i pu in blanched almonds. Like other reviews suiggested i combined the sugar and almonds together to roll the sticks in. This method worked okay for the first like 15 cookies but then the mixture became so saturated with the egg that came of the sticks that i could only get the stuff to stick in akward clumps. When they came out of the oven almost all of the cookies were pretty gross looking a yellowish color and with strange clumps. When i tried them the coating was chewy and oddly flavorless. The inside was okay iguess but had a weird aftertaste.",
