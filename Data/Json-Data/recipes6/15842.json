                "reviewBody": "I tried this bread. I am looking for a good bread to use to make homemade french toast. I didn't add the raisins this time. The dough was almost soupy when I went to put it in the fridge. I left it in my mixer bowl because of that. To my surprise it did rise a little by morning. I had to add 2-1/2 to 3 cups of flour to it to get it to a rolling or patting consistancy. My Kitchen Aid worked great for this! I can't imagine using a hand mixer. I also substituted powdered buttermilk for the liquid buttermilk. As someone else said it does make a lot of dough so I made two breads out of it. The sugar/cinnamon topping is enough for 2 breads. I let it rise again after it went into the pans for an hour in a warm oven as an experiement to see if it would rise at all again. Well it rose beautifully! I was afraid all that mixing in of the extra flour would have killed the yeast. I'm glad it didn't. Now to bake it. It baked for 25 minutes and looked nice. I let them cool and I sliced them. They tasted great! They sliced nice had good consistancy. Good I think for french toast. I was a little disapointed that there didn't seem to be more cinnamon flavor. I may increase the cinnamon another 1-2 tsp. I upped the amount I put in to 1 tbsp. I think it needs more. Also maybe adding more topping to the dough may help as well. Overall I'm very pleased with this recipe. It takes a while but the results are worth it. I WILL make this again!!!",

The batter for the first half of the recipe remained pretty soft and could not be rolled into a ball. I just covered it up with some plastic wrap in the bowl and it rose perfectly! I did not measure how much more flour I added into the risen dough but I left my dough pretty soft still. I rolled out the dough on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and proceeded with the recipe using cinnamon sugar instead of plain cinnamon. Unfortunately because I left the dough so soft it started t spread out on the cookie sheet so I just lifted the parchment paper into a bread pan and let it bake as the recipe stated. I rubbed some butter over the top when it finished baking and it soaked in giving it a nice buttery-cinnamon taste through the whole bread! It keeps well in the fridge when wrapped in plastic wrap. All I do is lightly toast a slice and it is perfect! Great breakfast bread!",

I wanted it somewhat wholesome so I used 3 1/2 cups unbleached flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. Then I had to add another 1 1/2 cups for it to actually be kneadable. I only used one package of yeast and 1/2 cup raisins. I mixed 1/4 cup into the dough and then spread the remaining 1/4 cup on before rolling. I like that this recipe can be prepared the night before and then just pressed out rolled up and baked in the morning- fits my lifestyle very well!!",

I decided to make the whole batch and split it in half with one loaf being \"plain\" and the other being cinnamon apple. Pros: The flavoring is great for a sweet bread. We actually even used the cinnamon apple bread for french toast one day and it was amazing! I also liked that it rose overnight which made the overall process easy since I was short on time the day I made the dough. Cons: The recipe as written comes out more liquid than dough. I increased my flour and my cooktime but I still didn't get it quite right for the first loaf. Definitely 45-60 mins!! Also I wouldn't make it plain. It was way too sweet to eat without something in it to kick it up a notch. Overall I'll make this again when I want a special sweet bread just because it rises overnight which makes the overall process pretty easy when you are short on time.",

I was able to get 6 huge cinnamon rolls and two medium sized loaves out of one batch. I think I'd halve it next time; it just makes way too much! I didn't use the overnight rise method because I had time to make it in its entirety yesterday so that's what I did. I definitely had to add more flour; I think it was about 2 cups when all was said and done so the ratio of liquid to dry ingredients is off. However when making bread it's also dependent on the humidity at the time you make it so the ratio is not always accurate from day to day. This is a light mild white bread that works well as a dessert loaf. Thanks for the recipe!",

I had some cinnamon bread in TN once and was always wanting to find a recipe that replicated it and happen to be recommended this on the recipe buzz. The bread tasted like cinnamon swirl bread but had the texture of monkey bread or a cinnamon roll. This is pretty close. I followed the recipe except I used mock buttermilk and 1/2 the raisins suggested. After refridgerating I ended up adding near 3/4 of a cup more flour during the quick kneading process just to make it more manageble. I shaped it into a 12x15 rectangle to add the sugar cinnamon and raisins as it didn't specify. I also had to heavy flour my hands to roll it and had to quickly transfer it to a bread pan. I just used a regular bread pan. It seemed like more than one loaf but not quite enough for two. I put the bread pan on a sheet pan and was glad I did because I got a little spillage in the first 10 minutes. If you are looking for perfectly swirled cinnamon bread that slices perfectly for the toaster this bread is not for you. But if you want super soft cinnamon roll like bread you can almost tear pieces off and eat you will love it!",

The dough however was extremely goopy (toooo much liquid in the recipe) so I'll have to tweak it like the other reviewers did until it can be made into a nice loaf. Better yet this recipe is good enough for cinnamon rolls so I'll have to play with it to get the dough just right.",

The second time I made a braid and put it on a baking sheet it was still much too soft on the inside and the crust was too hard. This is not a bread and not a sweet dough something in between that doesn't work. The dough is much too soft and there is too much leavening.",
