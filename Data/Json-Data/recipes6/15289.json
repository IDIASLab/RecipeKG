This is a MUCH safer option if you are going to be feeding this to the elderly, little children or pregnant, as raw eggs whites can have salmonella. Anyhow to test, I made 2 batches of frosting: one with raw egg whites and one with the dried egg whites and had my husband do a taste test to make sure I was still getting the same outcome. We both agreed that they both tasted exactly the same. I made my own yellow cake and also put sliced strawberries between the layers on top of the filling. YUMMY! I put raspberries and blueberries on top for the red and blue color. SUPER EASY FROSTING TO MAKE! I agree with previous review that if you are using a kitchenaid mixer, you don't need to mix for 20 minutes. Mine was done in under 10 and very very fluffy. Turned out beautiful!",

NOTE: taste good chilled but frosting does not hold up well overnight serve same day for best results. This is a keeper!!",

It is basically a meringue icing, so you will want to add about 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar, and 2 egg whites instead of one. The other big thing is to add about 1/2 cup of the sugar to the cup of strawberries and let them sit about 20-30 minutes to drain off most of the water. If you're going to put slices on top of the icing, you should drain them this way, as well. Getting rid of the water will help the icing last longer, as will the cream of tartar.",

Using fresh NJ strawberries 2 9\" rounds and cutting up bits of strawberries in between the layers... what a hit. Everyone at work loved the cake. Will DEFINATELY make again even with all the mess!",

This frosting has the consistency of Marshmallow Fluff and is a very pretty pink and just tastes incredible. Heck I wouldn't even need to eat cake-just sit there with my bowl of strawberry frosting!
