By placing the dough on a floured surface & sprinkling with flour, it removes the tackiness of the dough.  The dough does not stick to the rolling pin.  The only suggestion would be to let the donuts drain & cool somewhat before adding sugar/cinnamon coating.  If the sugar coating is added too soon, the donuts will retain too much sugar mixture and drown the taste of the donut & you will only be tasting the sugar.",

By the time we got to our holes (we did them last) we had it down pat.  Our doughnuts came out very crunchy and greasy, and not very doughy in the centers at all.  I think our mistake was not letting the oil get to temp (It really needs to be 370 or even a tad higher) or else the doughnuts just float around soaking up oil for too long.  Use high heat, and don't over cook (golden does not mean brown!  It took us a few tries to see the difference)  Personally, I think the flour ratio is right on.  I can see how adding extra flour could dilute the taste as another poster mentioned.  Do use extra flour when rolling out.  We will be doing these again soon to iron out our wrinkles and I'll review again.  In our case, I think the failure was our fault, not the recipe!  Use high heat!  Don't overcook!",

I read the other reviews before making these and have some hints for people who were finding the dough too sticky. I made the recipe as stated with two notable exceptions. First I used Becel margarine because that was all I had on hand. I don't buy butter unless I need it for shortbread. I will buy butter for this recipe. I think the butter would help the dough firm. After making the dough I divided it in half and added two tablespoons of dutch process cocoa in an attempt to try to make chocolate doughnuts for variety without making two different recipes - I lack willpower and my waistline doesn't need dozens of doughnuts in the house. The cocoa didn't work and that half of the batch was compost. It did however roll out better than the plain batch which was probably due to the extra dry ingredients. I let the dough sit in the fridge uncovered overnight. Also I rolled these out on a board slightly more floured than I would use for pastry. After cutting the doughnuts out I let them air dry while the oil was heating and then fried them for 1 1/2 minutes per side. We dusted only half of them with sugar/cinnamon mix and they were equally good without as they were with it. I've promised the family that next weekend will have a dougnut extravaganza and freeze the majority.",
