Im russian and I have made countless piroshkis in my lifetime and would have to say this recipe is almost spot (for the dough that is). I wouldn't cook the ground beef and actually I would use half ground pork half ground beef and add about 1/4 cup of water to the meat mixture, the more onions and garlic and other seasonings you add the tastier it will be so don't skimp on that and please please don't use dried ingredients that takes away the authenticity of this awesome dish.

I have been trying for several years to duplicate the delicious piroshki recipe my late Grandmother, born and raised in Russia, used to make us as children. The night we made these my brother walked in and grabbed one.  \"THESE ARE THEM, THESE ARE THEM!!\"  It was a great acheivment after so many failed attempts that never even came close.  I made so many batches night after night this holiday I think my family and friends finally had enough piroshi till next Christmas.  My Mother reminded me that my Grandmother also used to make them with cabbage and hard boiled eggs.  We did'nt do the eggs but we did have some with cabbage that were good.  We also thought of using the dough but adding spaghetti sauce, peperoni and chese for an Italian version.  (Sorry Grandma) Anyway if I never use another recipe again I will treasure this one.",

They were always fondly remembered but never duplicated until now. Mine turned out a little dry perhaps I drained the meat too well? I'm looking at other web sites now for similar recipes and one says a russian chef told her that dryness is a problem the chef adds bits of suet in the meat or chopped up frozen beef stock. Another recipe adds beef stock and butter to the meat to make it wetter. Some recipes add chopped up hard boiled eggs. I notice reviewers here added cheese. I cut mine open and added some cheese and it tasted good. Roll your dough thin thinner is better it puffs up thicker when you fry it.",

Totally old-fashioned, yes, but it yields unmatched richness. (Ground meat lends a much harsher and hollow flavor) (Trust me, I've eaten these for 40+ years). Ironically, though, if you want to cut time on making the dough- frozen Bridgefield bread loaves, thawed and rolled out, yields virtually the same taste as far as the bread is concerned.",
