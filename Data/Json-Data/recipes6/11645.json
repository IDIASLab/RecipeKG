It was a little difficult to tell when they were done and I overbaked the first sheet-full but they still taste great. The consistency is like shortbread so I had a few with my coffee this morning (I expect they'd be equally good with tea or hot cocoa.) Most of the batch I made are being sent to my boyfriend in the Army but I brought the rest in to work and so far everyone seems to really like them.:) I will probably make these for Christmas gifts although I think next time I'll roll them in crushed sliced almonds before baking. I might also try making batches entirely with almonds instead of chocolate chips.",
