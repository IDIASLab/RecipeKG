If I make it again, I would skip the sweetened yogurt (and use plain) and I would eliminate the brown sugar entirely. I thought the idea of fully dusting the blueberries in cinnamon would work similar to dusting the berries with flour, but sadly the cinnamon trick still made the berries migrate to the bottom of the cake. Next time I would toss the berries with flour or some of the cake mix to correct that problem. Otherwise, a very good and simple coffee cake. Thanks for sharing.",

Plus I added half a box of vanilla pudding mix since the recipe called for a pudding cake mix. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I followed other reviewers suggestions and tossed the blueberries in flour instead of the cinnamon. Plus I only folded in half of the blueberries then stuffed the rest on top after I poured it into the pan. The finished product was a little moist around the blueberries otherwise it turned out perfect! The taste was amazing! And the blueberries were fairly well dispursed. My husband who is an overly picky eater can't stop picking at it. That earns an instant 5 stars!",

I personally would not make this again as written. I do think however that it s a good base recipe for a moist blueberry coffee cake.
