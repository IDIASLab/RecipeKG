I like nutmeg, so the flavor was perfect for me.  If nutmeg isn't your thing, try substituting 2 tsp. of lemon, lime, or orange zest.  Also, I added 3T of sour cream with the butter.  It makes for very tender pastry.  Since it's a fairly soft dough, chill as long as possible (I did overnight) so that you have to use a min. amount of flour for rolling.  Better yet, roll between 2 sheets of waxed paper, remove the top sheet, cut the shapes without removing them, and put the whole thing in the freezer for a few minutes to get them good and stiff again.  They will pop out easily and the scraps can be re-rolled over and over since no flour was added in rolling.",

Ms. Lucy (a grandma figure) used to baby sit me and she made tea cakes that looked and tasted JUST LIKE these! I am almost 50 years old and I've tried many tea cake recipes trying to recapture the taste and texture of Ms. Lucy's tea cakes.  Until now, I was unsuccessful.  These cookies are absolutely delicious!!!!  Not only are they delicious, but I get to savor wonderful memories of Ms. Lucy reaching into airtight plastic container (an empty lard bucket LOL) and saying, \"Sweetie, would you like a tea cake?\"  :).  Many thanks to the person who shared this wonderful recipe.",

(my father was from Mississippi and loved to bake) Through the years I've been searching for this recipes and never found it.  Then one day I decided to try again and that's when I hit \"pay dirt\" I ran across this one!  Honey, honey when I read the ingredients I knew this was \"the\" one I had been searching for.  As stated they taste even better a day or two later.  I made two batches for Christmas and my daughters' friends came over and had never had the honour of tasting tea cakes.  I don't have to tell you the results.  This has been a  big hit and also introducing the younger generations to a little of their history to them.  Baking from scratch is almost a dying issue - but thanks to recipes like this one - there is hope.  I was sooooo excited to find this I called my brother (who also loves to cook and bake) and we both were jumping on the outside as well as on the inside.  The key to this  recipe is the NUTMEG!  That's what makes the unique flavoring.  For those of you who are thinking of trying it- you won't go wrong!  So for all of you ladies (oooops sorry- gentlemen who love to cook/bake) add this to your recipe box. Like others - make more than one batch (freeze in seperate bags) so when the urge hits, you can  have a fresh batch of \"cookies\"  anytime.   I have a taste for some  right now and I have all of the ingredients.  I feel a bake on. :)",
