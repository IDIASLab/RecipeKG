It is perfect. \n\nI did however make an alteration - I added 2tbs of cream to the butter mix and I used 50/50 butter margarine mix.\n\nI have done the recipe both the original and with the alterations, but my family and I much preferred it with the cream added - made a world of difference! I will also add that I cut the recipe in HALF and I still had enough to fill 24 tarts (with homemade crust in a muffin pan) - so the butter recipe does yield a lot of extra - a perfect option to do the butter pie instead!",

They were very yummy & easy to make but I had to cook them a fair bit longer than stated in the directions as the filling was pretty runny once I bit into them.  I think I probably added on another 10 minutes only because I prefer my filling not to be as runny. Added pecans...I could have added more pecans in my opinion but they were pretty small tarts. My college age son loved them & he's pretty picky...score 1 for me!",
