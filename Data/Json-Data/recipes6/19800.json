I used brown sugar instead of white in the crumb topping because of personal preference and would suggest doubling the topping recipe if you like a lot of crumbs; it doesn't make a whole lot. Overall a very nice coffee cake and easy to make with ingredients everyone has on hand!",

I am glad that I did. It is quick and easy and uses basic ingredients that most of us already have in our cupboards and refrigerator. I reduced the oven temperature to 350 (375 seems too hot for such a small cake) and baked for the recommended time of 25 minutes. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter. I also topped the cake with a glaze made from powder sugar almond extract and a little bit of milk. No need to cool the cake before topping with glaze since there is no butter in it. This has earned a page in my favorite recipes collection! Thank you for sharing such a special recipe and the history of it.",

I have 5 children home during the day and they gobble this up when I make it.  It is a good \"standby\" esp when you are in a \"pinch\": short on time or short on ingredients.  This has just a few simple ingredients that most of us always have on hand.  It does make quite a \"small\" coffee cake so I usually double it or at least 1 1/2 times the recipe. By \"forgiving\" I mean you can be pretty creative with this recipe and still come out with a simple delicious breakfast or snack cake.  I have substituted oat flour, or ground flax meal for part of the flour.  I have added a dab of sour cream to make it more rich.  I have added sugar cinnamon to the batter.  I have added nuts.  I get creative w/ whatever I happen to have on hand.  We almost always double the topping too.  I think you could add a little apple sauce or pumpkin puree to this recipe for variation.  It is just a great BASIC coffee cake and I love the history behind it.  I know nothing about the Ben Lippen school but when I make this recipe I always get curious to know more about it.  We had this coffee cake for breakfast this morning.  Just delicious!  ",
