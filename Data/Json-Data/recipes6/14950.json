I recomend that you make this frosting to cover it. 1&1/2 c powdered sugar 3 tbs butter softened 1&1/2 tbs milk 1/2 tbs cocoa Mix all of the ingredients together. When you take the cake out of the oven poke holes all through it with a toothpick then put half of the frosting on it. Place the cake in the still warm oven and let the frosting melt into the holes. Then take the cake out of the oven and put the remainder of the frosting on the cake. It's the perfect cake for a small group of people! We loved it like this!",
