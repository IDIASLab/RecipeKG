It doesn t specify in the recipe but I always use salted butter in any recipe regardless of whether or not it calls for salt. I recommend refrigerating your dough for about 15 minutes then actually rolling it out to an even 1/4inch thickness. I pressed mine down and it just didn t cook as evenly as it could. I think I ll be making these again but adding some cinnamon or ginger.",
