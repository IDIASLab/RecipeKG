Not bad if you like that but many cookie recipes have less sugar than flour so next time if I make this I will reduce the sugar by a cup. The bad side of doing that is I might just be left with enough for 3.5 batches of cookies instead of 4. Also I think the sifting step might really help to thoroughly mix the ingredients I wonder if people have had different results because of unevenly mixed ingredients? (For example too much baking powder clumped in one of the cups taken or or not enough etc.?)",
