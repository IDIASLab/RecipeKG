I used 12 white mushrooms one can of regular tuna in water drained 1/4 cup of Fat Free Kraft Cheddar Cheese only 1 tbsp of mayo a sprinkle of onion powder and a sprinkle of garlic powder. And they were fantastic. Even though the calories were already low with the original recipe I got mine down to about 24-1/2 calories per mushroom and still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.",

I made a half recipe because I actually had a half can of tuna leftover from another recipe. I only use tuna in olive oil. I had a block of swiss cheese instead of slices and I shredded it until I had 1 ounce by weight. I added about 1/4 t of lemon pepper seasonging salt instead of salt and papper. The mixture was very dry and was difficult to stuff in the mushrooms (granted mine were a bit on the small side). I also had most of the mixture leftover when a half package of mushrooms were stuffed. I cannot imagine serving these at a party and won't be making these again.",
