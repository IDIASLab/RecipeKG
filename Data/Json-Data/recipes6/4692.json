The salsa added a surprising amount of depth although next time I will not use store bought salsa.  I made the recipe as directed and it was better the next day, but not awesome.  one night for leftovers I pulled a couple cups out and I added adobo sauce, cumin and cilantro for a more southwestern flavor and another night I added turmeric, curry powder and paste and ginger for a mid-east vibe.  Both were excellent...I will use the recipe as a guide for other dishes in the future.",

One trick to easily remove the tough stem of the kale is to grab the thickest end of the stem with one hand, circle your index finger and thumb of your other hand around the stem and pull down.
