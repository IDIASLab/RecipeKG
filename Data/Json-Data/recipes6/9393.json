My husband and I made this sauce (served over fettuccine noodles) for my friend and her husband, as they just had their third child a few days ago and we figured they could use the break from cooking - they went nuts, they loved it so much!  Even their two younger sons (3 and 2) loved this dish.  It literally tastes IDENTICAL to the sauce that they serve at the Olive Garden.  Another good tip is to add a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce - it really tastes great.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could - I will NEVER buy alfredo sauce again!  The next time I might use milk and a little cornstarch instead of the cream (as one previous reviewer suggested) and perhaps reduced fat margarine to save on fat and calories.  Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan (available in bags in the dairy section), Kraft grated just doesn't do it as well - and the shredded parm melts really well.  ENJOY this incredible dish!

                "reviewBody": "Very good flavor in this recipe, but I did add a 2nd clove of garlic. If you just stir the cream into the butter and let it simmer, it will seperate. I gently whisk the cream and butter the entire time it's simmering and whisk while adding the cheese (a little at a time) and it doesn't seperate, even after a day in the fridge. The consistency is a little hard to get smooth, but probably because parmesan is a very hard cheese with a granular texture to begin with, and doesn't melt smoothly. I used a parmesan/asiago blend and it was beautifully smooth after lots of whisking. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter - if you use margarine or lightly salted butter, it's way too salty. I used this recipe to make a white chicken lasagna, which was absolutely delicious, and it held up well in the refrigerator to have leftovers the next day.",

My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I've made before though not from this site (copy cat recipes; the book actually). I added 1/8 tsp ground pepper since the flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I'm am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn't even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This alfredo is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it's flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic.",
