I like the skin left on the apples for bits of color(and added fiber) I used half cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup a-p flour. I only had buttermilk so used that in lieu of regular milk. Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the batter and this complimented the other flavors nicely. These are not very sweet so sugar/cinnamon mixture on top was a plus. I also added tsp. vanilla. These were super moist with a fluffy light texture even with using the w.wheat flour. They almost had a 'tutti-frutti' flavor. Very nice muffin.",

I am generally not one to hack these recipes to death when I try them, but I did make a few changes this time (some out of necessity and some out of preference).  I didn't have any lemons on hand, so instead of using the zest and juice of a lemon, I added a tsp of Penzey's lemon extract, which is nice and strong and imparted a nice natural-tasting lemon flavor.  I diced the apples very, very finely because if my 2-year old finds chunks of anything in her muffins, she spits them out.  (I would love to know if anyone has made this with grated apples, by the way!)  10 T of butter seemed like a lot to me, so I used 6 T of butter and 4 T. of natural style applesauce; this was just enough butter to keep the muffins rich and moist.  I added about a half tsp of cinnamon to the batter and skipped the cinnamon/sugar on top.  These are moist, flavorful, not-too-dense and not-too-light, and I agree with another reviewer in saying kind of tutti-fruitti in flavor.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great muffin recipe!",

I didn't bother to lighten the recipe this time because just by looking at them I knew they'd be good and....we'll.....I wanted to indulge today. I wasn't really too concerned about the lemon flavor--I used Spice Island's dried lemon peel. I didn't use a whole tablespoon a heaping teaspoon was more than plenty. Next time I make these I don't think the outcome of the muffin would be drastically changed if I cut the butter by half (at least) and used organic unsweetened applesauce in it's place. I would also cut back on the baking powder just a bit but that's personal choice. I did get twelve regular muffins and 18 mini-muffins out of this recipe more than the original recipe stated. I always bake my muffins at 350; the large ones for 20 minutes and the mini ones for 12 minutes.",
