We make it in a turkey roasting oven. 20 special around Thanksgiving. The roaster allows us to get the desired temperature without heating up the entire house with the oven. Be aware it generates a LOT of steam in the house. The interior of the windows in the kitchen gets wet when cooking this. Kind of alarming. The only changes I ever make are to add another tablespoon of syrup. In regards to the syrup any \"golden syrup\" will do. You can substitute Karo maple syrup or a jam but it's not as good. The golden syrup is a must for this recipe.",
