The recipe says it makes two pies---if I divided it up for two pies, it would not have been very deep.  Also--I doubled the crumbly stuff on top and used mostly almonds instead of walnuts.  The inside of the pie is a little tart and sweet and the topping is sweet--balances it out for a delicious treat!!!  Very unique recipe.",
