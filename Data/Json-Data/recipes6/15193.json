I changed some of the ingredients and method slightly to suit - I omitted the egg and instead creamed the butter and sugar with the cinnamon (I also added nutmeg vanilla essence and citrus peel to the fruit). I prefer to make smaller buns so I cut the dough into eight pieces and made four small buns out of each piece - 32 total. I found them sweet enough if using a sugar glaze on top. Thanks very much Arvilla - you saved my first Easter in Japan.",
