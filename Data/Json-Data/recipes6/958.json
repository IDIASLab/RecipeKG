                "reviewBody": "I like this recipe and have made it three times, with modifications the second and third time. Some observations: Chinese use pork butt for Char Siu because we love the fat and it really is part and parcel to the authentic dish. That said, I used tenderloin the first time, pork sirloin roast the second, and pork shoulder the last. The latter/fatter cut was better in flavor and juiciness, but of course, less healthy.\n\nI do like pretty red colored char siu but against my better judgement, I used the full 2 tablespoons of food color which was huge overkill.  I went with 1 tablespoon the second time and it was still way too much and stained my cutting board. Food coloring is terrible for our bodies so cut it way back, or not at all, or as suggested, substitute red bean paste or boil down some beets if you want it red. \n\nI also like five spice, but take care how much you use. It will overpower all other ingredients. I suggest 1/2 teaspoon or less.\nReserve 1/2 cup of the marinade for non-cross contaminated basting before you bag up the meat, and marinate it no less than overnight. It needs to be in the soup that long to penetrate. Don't cook it for an hour or you'll overcook. Use a thermometer and pull it at 145 degrees and let it rest. The water pan is a good suggestion if you are using leaner cuts. A whole butt roast makes a lot, so I portion it up and freeze pieces for later use. I just made \nChar Siu, doufu, fan (BBQ pork tofu over rice) using bean paste as the main seasoning f",

He followed the recipe ingredients including some good shakes of the Chinese five spice, garlic powder, and onion powder. We marinated our tenderloins for 8 hours (cutting the two into four 2-inch thick loins). He cooked this on the charcoal grill over indirect heat as directed, but He kept the water pan in the whole time. The loins being only 2 inches thick reached 145\u00b0 in 40 minutes, so watch your time. I cooked the remaining marinade on the stove-top, adding in some cornstarch to thicken it and he basted the meat. Next time I'll make a batch and half of the sauce, it really was great tasting, but we really had to stretch it. We served over white rice with broccoli, all a great combination. Just a note, if you have a green egg cooker, there is a YouTube video on how you can cook this like the Cantonese do by hanging it in your grill.",
