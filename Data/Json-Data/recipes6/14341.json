I poured the syrup over the bread and let it sit for a few minutes. I used Oaxaca Cheese which is very similar to Mozzarella and I omitted the anise candies since I don't care for them. Next time I think I will try it with sharp cheddar. Good recipe thanks.",

I felt it was a little too dry for my liking so I almost used 2 1/2 cups brown sugar & 2 1/2 cups water. It made it more of a bread pudding texture a lot more moist. I didn t have French bread so I used sliced white bread and it worked out fine. I also used crushed almonds for the nuts. My husband loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again!",
