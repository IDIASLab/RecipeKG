It's delicious and tastes just like I remember! I will say that I have never steamed a pudding before so I thought the directions were a little vague in that area. Thanks to You Tube I was able to brush up on steaming a pudding! There was no time listed for the steaming but 2 hours seemed to do the trick for me. I will make this again! The sauce is amazing as well!",
