Sure enough, very thin...so, after asking my mothers I have come up with this for future readers.  1.  I used liquid pectic (3oz).  My mother swears that gramma used to use powdered because she thought it also contained geletin.  so, I'm wondering if the other syrupy reviewers used liquid?  Also, the recipe did not state whether I should mash the pears, so basically I have pears in syrup.  Taste pretty good though, which is why I gave it two stars.  Will use on pancakes or something.  *Updated* mashed the pears and recanned.  worked out much better. So, mash your pears or you get syrup.",

I reduced thecwhite sugar by 1/2-1 cup; reduced the nutmeg by 1/2 tsp, the cloves by 1 tsp, and added 3/4 tsp cinnamon.  I also increased the lemon juice to 2 TBSP and reduced the water by 1/2 cup.  After simmering the pear chunks I used my immersion blender to \"puree\" the pears (I did leave some fruit chunks).  I added a 1/2 tsp butter when I added the pectin to help reduce foaming.  I think I cooked the final mixture before the brown sugar and spice additions for 10 or more minutes to ensure setting.  I filled 10 8 oz. jars in the end and had a fragrant, tasty \"butter.\"  If I made this again I think I would replace the water with pear nectar for added \"pearness.\"",

Made an amazing batch of Preserves. Tastes excellent. I got 7 1/2 pint jars and 2 pint jars. Two of the half pint jars are more liquid than the rest does anyone know why this would be?
