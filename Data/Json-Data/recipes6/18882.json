I was hoping for the hardness of the cheap gingersnap cookies that you can pick up at the supermarket but these turned out more chewy even after \"rebaking\" them to dry out. The amount of ginger was perfect; I love ginger so I will probably add more in the future. Molasses is super-expensive where I live overseas so 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. water did the trick. No self-rising flour here so I added some baking powder. Will be making these again for sure! Great with a strong black tea.",
