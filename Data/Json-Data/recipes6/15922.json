I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cup. Also, made my own glaze with the following ingredients: cook 5 minutes 1 qt. Sliced berries, 1 cup sugar, 3 Tb cornstarch, and 1 Tb lime juice, add a little orange juice if glaze is too thick. Please note, the quart of strawberries used for the glaze is separate from the quart used for the topping. Once the glaze was prepared and had cooled, I stirred in the other quart of sliced fresh strawberries. Many compliments of how great tasting the fresh strawberries were, and quite a few comparisons to really good strawberry shortcake.  Once strawberry season had passed, I made this recipe with only frozen berries.  It still tasted good, but lacked the beautiful bright red color and texture of fresh strawberries.  I\u2019ve made this with angel food cake, with pound cake, and with yellow cake.  I prefer the yellow cake.  Next time, I plan to divide the yellow cake batter between a 9 x 13 inch pan and an 8 inch square pan, so that there is enough room in the pans to layer on the toppings without crumbling up the cake.  It will look better when served.  The crumbled cake was a little messy.",

If you take this dessert to a potluck, don't expect any leftovers!  They will lick the bowl clean.  Now for the changes...  I use 2 pounds of strawberries.  I fold about 2/3 of them into the glaze and use the remainder to garnish the top.  Storebought glaze is a great timesaver, but I make my own when I have time.  There are many different ways to make glaze.  Most often, I use a 3 oz. box of strawberry gelatin, 4 to 5 tablespoons of cornstarch, a cup of sugar, and 2 cups of boiling water.  Cook until thickened and let cool and you're ready to go!  I use the larger, 12 oz container of whipped topping.  I only used one 8-oz package of cream cheese the first time around because I only had one on hand.  It turned out fine, so I've never added more than 8 oz of cream cheese.  I also sweeten the whipped topping to taste, as a cup of sugar seem like too much for my family's taste.  I have always used storebought angel food cake but I'd like to try it with white cake from a mix.  My favorite thing about this recipe is that it is so versatile.  Blueberries, raspberries, and peaches would be great with the appropriate glazes. A blueberry/strawberry combo would be great for the 4th of July!  ",

It makes a beautiful presentation in a trifle dish which is what I use or a large glass bowl; in fact I've always called this recipe Strawberry Trifle. The only thing I do differently is sweeten the strawberries overnight and drain off most of the excess liquid prior to assembling the next day. Marie's makes a really nice strawberry glaze that you can usually find in the produce section of most grocery stores. The glaze is essential IMO.",

Everyone wanted the recipe. I did make a few alterations to the recipe such as using Splenda instead of Sugar and just mashing up some strawberries and Splenda to make my own Glaze.  This can be a great recipe for someone who is watching their fat and sugar intake.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
