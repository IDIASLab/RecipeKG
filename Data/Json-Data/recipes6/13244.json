You don't really taste that there's coffee in the pie but rather a nice hint of mocha. If I didn't know it was in the pie I never would have known. One thing to point out is that I had enough filling for 2 full 9\" pie shells (not deep dish purchased in the freezer section at my local grocery store)rather than just one. That was great since I was making the pie for a gift.....then we had another one to try ourselves! It was delicious rich and a perfect pie you will be proud to serve! This has now become my husbands favorite pecan pie!",

And no my husband is not a chef - this pie is just that simple! We didn't put in the instant coffee - but followed the rest to the \"t.\" We used frozen pie crusts and they worked great - but i would recommend you put some foil under the pan as it did spill out some as it was cooking (since frozen pie crusts are usually in more shallow pans). This is a fantastic recipe. We are going to be making 2 more pies this week for Christmas dinner! I can't wait! Yum!",
