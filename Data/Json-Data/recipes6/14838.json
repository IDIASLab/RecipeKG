It was absolutely wonderful and so easy to follow. The Marsala wine makes the cake. I also saved a few cherries to decorate the top and perimeter of the cake as well. It turned out beautiful. I took it to a spaghetti dinner where it was a wonderful hit. Needless to say we had none left to bring home.",

I added some extra Italian Glace fruit - cherries Clementines and figs in the mix and also for decoration. Pistachios also added an extra crunch. You only need a small slice so this cake easily will feed 12 to 15 people. Great for a special occasion.",

Had more filling left after filling two layers so should have put a thicker amount on! Didn't have currents at my local grocery store so added golden raisins in with the cherries. Overall very good! Love the flavor the Marsala wine adds to the frosting and filling! I may have added extra to both..?? cause I liked the added richness of the wine! I'll be making this again with more 'tweaking' and actual ricotta to compare the flavor difference... I can never resist 'tweaking' recipes to my preferences when cooking so gave 4 instead of 5. And hate coming on and seeing the same recipes posted with hundreds of personal tweaks instead of one recipe with comments on personal changes! Is easier for me to just read through and decide how I want to adjust a recipe!",
