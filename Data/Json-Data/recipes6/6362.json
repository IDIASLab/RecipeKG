Was nothing a small side of Frank's Redhot for dipping couldn't fix. The only change I made was to use Garlic powder and a pinch of salt (instead of garlic salt-1 tablespoon seemed like a lot) to cut down on sodium. It was certainly easy for a weekday meal and I could see it being a great way to get kids to eat tuna. But since I don't have kids I am not sure this would be a \"go to\" over a simple bean/chicken/spices/cheese filling for quesadillas.",

I substituted guacamole for the sour cream (which is really telling because I LOVE my sour cream) and fresh minced garlic as opposed to garlic salt. I also cut out the butter and used coconut oil to fry the tortilla in. I served them with fresh pico de gallo. Aside from being a bit messy they're super flavorful. I used garden spinach tortillas instead of wheat. I like how a littke can go a long way here as the tuna and black beans are quite filling. I'll be recommending these to everyone!",
