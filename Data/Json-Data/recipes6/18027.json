You can buy joshinko (rice flour), katakuriko (potato starch), and sesame oil at asian market. If you live in large city, you may find them at American grocery store. Joshinko and katakuriko taste nothing different from regular flour, but they really help to make crispy fried chicken. Do not use sweet soy sauce or too salty soy sauce.",

I check the local supermarked for rice flour and potato starch and found they had rice flour but no potato starch. Then I came across a gluten free all-purpose mix in the same store. The mix listed rice flour, tapioco starch and potato starch as the first three ingredients and thus I decided to give it a try. It worked perfectly. Definitely give this recipe a try. You won't regret it.",

If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer put a wooden utensil into the oil and touch the bottom of the pot. If bubbles rise from there the oil is hot enough. If A LOT of bubbles rise it's too hot turn it down a little! I put paper towels in a pasta plate and kept it in the oven at 170 till all of the chicken was fried. Even the chicken I cooked first was still in good shape when it came time to eat!",
