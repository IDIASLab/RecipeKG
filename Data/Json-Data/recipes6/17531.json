However if you're looking at the serving size as a guideline I didn't find it accurate. I used balls that were definitely under a tablespoon each and only got 5 dozen cookies. I was skeptical when I saw the quantities of the ingredients and it turns out I was right. I didn't make the half moon shape I just rolled each bit of dough into a ball and flattened them a bit. Took 12 minutes and ended up delicious. Reminded me a bit of shortbread.",

I did have two problems one was the same as another reviewer in that the quantity stated is way off. I used a tablespoon measure to make sure they were all the same size. I only got 30 cookies total. The other that was when bending them they kept breaking on me and just didn't want to shape very well to they were hard to form. But the taste is great. I do think in the future I will sift on the powdered sugar instead of trying to roll the cookies in it. It should be easier and prettier.",

I rolled the dough into balls while holding it in my hands I pinched the tops to make peaks then gently pushed down on the base to flatten the bottoms so they could sit upright. Dusting with the confectioners/powered sugar (almost immediately out of the oven) they looked like mountain peaks with snow. Vanilla beans being pricy where we live I lightly used vanilla extract (1/2 tsp); possibly causing the crumble. However going with the mountain peaks theme I would add almond extract (1/4 tsp) to enhance the nuts.",
