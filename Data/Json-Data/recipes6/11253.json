This was NOT it. The ingredients were correct as I recall but the pudding turned out a much different consistency even though I added extra baking powder after reading previous reviews. The sauce never really thickened up (even after cooling on the counter several hours!) until it was in the fridge overnight. I added walnuts and used Craisins instead of raisins so the taste was pretty good... But I will ask my mom if she still has the recipe somewhere. I don't think I'll make this particular version again but thanks anyway Holly.:)",
