Sometimes I change around spices and have even omitted them in a glaze but this is an excellant fast fix for chili sauce or instant BBQ sauce. It's great to slather onto spareribs before the final finish broiling. I usually simmer it a minute or so to blend the flavors but that is definately optional.",
