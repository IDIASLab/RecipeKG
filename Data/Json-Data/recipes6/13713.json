I make the best cookies, my sister, Carol, makes the best pies in the whole world!...no competition in our family! This recipe includes an ingredient called free-flowing brown sugar. This is a non-clumping or caking version of ordinary brown sugar. It has a lower moisture content then the traditional one, which makes it free flowing much like granulated sugar. It is available at most specialty supermarket. If it is not available in your part of the world, use regular brown sugar and make sure it is broken up, free of clumps. Macintosh or Granny Smith apples are the best choices for apple pie because they are the least mushy apples.",

I previously used my mother's apple pie recipe, which wasn't great (not an Italian specialty-smile). OMG!!!  When I cut into this pie, I couldn't believe it!  Could not believe that I made this pie!  I used the Pillsbury Refrigerated Rolled Pie Crust (delicious) and followed the recipe to a near \"t\" with the following changes: I added 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla to the apple mixture, I baked the pie at 450 degrees for 15 minutes then 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  Pie came out PERFECTLY!!!!  Not too sweet, not gooey, not too wet or too dry, perfect mixture of sweet and spicy, tender & tasty apples, perfect crust!  Absolutely wonderful!  Can't wait for my dear husband to taste this tonight!  Will definitely be making this pie again and again and again!!!",

The crust turns out purfect every time. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.",

Depending on how juicy the apples are 1/2 cup flour might be just right or it could be a bit much but I hate a watery pie so I normally do use that much flour just to be sure. It is better to determine doneness by whether the juices have started to boil instead of the crust color. If it isn't boiling yet and the crust is getting too brown put foil strips over the edges.",
