Try this for a moist option of mashed potatoes with no butter, milk or gravy required. You can add more garlic if you like. I usually do.

I added the cooked bacon and onion into the eggplant potato mixture before I mashed it. I didn't add the olive oil called for when I mashed I added some mayonnaise an old family tradition. My husband loved this dish also.",
