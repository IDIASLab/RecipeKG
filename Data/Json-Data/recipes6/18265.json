I used my standard 9x13 and it was far too much for the dish. It didn't cook right.  I tried again, halving the recipe.  I also modified the order for adding ingredients - I mixed the eggs into the butter/sugar.  I combined the flours, cheese, and baking powder and mixed them in together, adding the milk last.  It took 35 minutes to bake right. It was perfect. I uploaded pics.  For fun, I used a biscuit-cutter to make pretty circles instead of cutting it into squares.",

My only concern was the topping. Without any added butter to it.... The top if the cake had a bit of a white dusting to it. I'm assuming that the sugar sesame topping is suppose to be like a streusel. So next time I'm going to add some butter to it and see what happens. But even with that the taste was awesome so it still gets 5 stars!!!",
