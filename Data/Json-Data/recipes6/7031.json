        "description": "My own delicious variation of a curried squash-based soup using the acorn variety. With careful thought and care, I've created a smooth and invigorating soup that would provide a perfect dinner starter to any party or social gathering. Certainly a multi-purpose dish that would work well anywhere. Perfect in your favorite mug for chilly rainy days. When with friends, I like to serve it with baked honey ham and salad (just an idea). You'll have everyone asking you where you learned to cook so well, I promise!",
