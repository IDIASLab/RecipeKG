For easy removal I greased pan & lined it with parchment paper which I also greased. At 30 minutes toothpick doesn't come out clean but the top is set & brownies are perfectly moist. Note: Cake meal is ground finer then regular matzo meal. You can make matzo cake meal by using blender to grind matzo meal into a fine powder. Strain to sift out any lumps. Brownies freeze well. If freezing don't ice until defrosted. Optional Icing: In microwave melt in 20 second intervals 6 ozs. semi-sweet chocolate squares or chips 1 tbsps. margarine & 1/8 1/16 tsp. water.",
