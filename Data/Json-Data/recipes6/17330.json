I wanted a classic cheesecake and this fits the bill. Texture is very creamy. I did use another recipe for the crust (1 1/2 C graham cracker crumbs 1/3 C melted butter 1/4 C sugar - bake for 10 minutes). I've made other cheesecakes in the past and have had problems with cracking or sinking in the middle. This one looks perfect due to the water bath. I did have trouble with water leaking into the springform pan (I ended up making the crust twice because the first one was ruined) but will experiment a bit more with the technique to get it just right. I read online to use a plastic turkey oven bag instead of the foil. No leaks! I served the cheesecake with a seedless raspberry sauce I made from frozen berries and sugar. This made an excellent birthday cake for my BF.",
