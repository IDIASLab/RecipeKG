It could have used even more. Even my husband who adores rhubarb pies and cherry pies because of their tartness had a tough time eating this one. I used orange juice in place of water and in retrospect probably should have used it in place of the lemon juice as well. This pie needs no further acid beyond what the cranberries already bring to the table. I increased the butter to 2 tablespoons as I fail to see how a mere 2 teaspoons could live up to the title of a \"buttery\" pie (and 2 Tb is not a lot for a 9\" pie.) Added 1 tsp grated orange peel and 1/4 tsp mace which goes perfectly with the flavor of cranberries. The color is a deep crimson a perfect centerpiece for your holiday table. Just know that the sourness of this pie is so intense that it might not appeal to all.",

This makes for shorter oven time and lessens the chance of over cooking the pie crust which sometimes happens.  \nI also added about 2-3 cups of cut apples to the filling after the cranberries cooked and some cinnamon and it turned out fabulous!  If you have a deep pie dish I recommend adding something as the recipe amount is not enough to properly fill a deep dish.  \nGreat find!",
