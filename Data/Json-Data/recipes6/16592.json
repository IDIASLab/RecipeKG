Update - made this again - teenagers love this chili - I didn't have good drinking wine on hand today but the Holland House Red Cooking Wine was passable for this recipe - I think the heat in this chili negates the wine flavor!!! I've also been adding more tomatoe paste since my family and guests like a thicker sauce and is good for the way they eat the leftovers. When I serve this I've been putting out small dishes of diced onions shredded cheddar cheese or american and sour cream. Everyone seems to enjoy making their own creations. Definitely put out some bread - a salad goes well with this also - especially if you like your chili spicy. - When we are lucky enough to have leftovers the kids love to just heat this up making a sandwich on white bread or hambuger rolls with a thin slice of onion and melted cheez whiz - messy but soooo good. Again Cathie - thanks - this is the only chili I ever make now.",

It was thin so I used up the rest of the can of tomato paste (6 oz.) as other reviewers suggested the last thirty minutes of cooking. It could have been more tomatoey tasting. I didn't have black beans so I used a can of ranch style beans and a can of dark kidney beans. This was pretty good but I just couldn't give it 4 star it needed way too many changes. Not bad at all but we prefer a lot more spice and much much more chili peppers. Way too bland for our tastes. I served this over a bed of cooked spaghetti pasta and topped it with shredded colby/mj cheese. Hubby and son like chopped onion on theirs too. I won't bother even trying to make this again. We liked It's Chili by George far better.",
