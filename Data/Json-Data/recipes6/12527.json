I did one batch with putting the jelly on AFTER baking them and a second batch putting the jelly on halfway through baking. I preferred the batch in which I added jelly halfway through baking because it stays in place better and it looks nicer, more smooth. I used apple jelly and colored half green, half red for Christmas. The dough was very easy and nice to work with! Make sure you put a DEEP imprint in the cookie for the jelly. The first batch I put a regular thumbprint in the cookies and when they baked, you could hardly see it anymore and there wasn't much of a well anymore for the jelly.",

Used half as many whole eggs instead of separated since I didn't do the nut thing. I added a pinch of cream of tartar and a pinch of baking soda because I couldn't find the baking powder andI wanted teh cookies to puff up. I added about 1/2 cup more sugar because I was afraid they wouldn't be very sweet and rolled the balls a bit bigger. I filled half of them with apricot preserves and the other half with raspberry. I never even looked at the baking time and temps but I baked them at 325 convection for 12 minutes. Everyone loved them and I plan to make them again soon!",

When doubling or tripling the recipe you should be able to save some of the egg whites for another use. I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also omitted the salt and the cookies tasted fine. To make dough easier to handle try chilling it for about an hour or more before shaping it into balls. Very impressive-looking cookies!",
