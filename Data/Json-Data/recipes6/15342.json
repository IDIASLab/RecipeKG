They need something - maybe cinnamon granulated coffee chocolate chips... something to give them more flavor. Everyone who has tasted them so far has tried to be polite about the flavor... These are by far one of the worst cookies I've made in a while could ruin my reputation as a good cookie baker - and I still have 2 more batches to make out of this dough that is supposed to make 72 cookies!",

I've been making these for close to 20 years they are a family favorite and everybody else that tries them asks for the recipe. As for flattening them out they are supposed to be cake like in the way they rise. And when it comes to rolling them in powdered sugar you need to make sure there is a deep enough dish of it to coat them really good. It doesn't soak into the cookies then. I just made a double of these this last weekend and shared them with all my friends in my apartment building and they wanted more. I'm sorry some of you didn't like them. One other thing since I don't like nuts and my daughter-in-law- is allergic to them I never add them. The cottage cheese in them feels like a soft nut anyway once they are baked.",

I was out of vanilla and used a 1/4 tsp of almond extract instead. Also I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper which gave them just a touch of spice...reminded me of a red hot. Because the recipe made so many cookies I cut the recipe to a quarter. I recommend flattening the dough balls on the pan as they did not spread at all once cooked. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. These were very very moist and tasted just like a brownie. I found the powdered sugar step to be pointless as the sugar gets absorbed into the dough and makes the cookies look grey. Next time I'll dust with powdered sugar after removing from oven. Good use for extra cottage cheese. Oh yeah I used low-fat and it tasted great!",
