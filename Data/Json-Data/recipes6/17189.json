This recipe calls for too much dressing in my opinion (yes I am counting the reduced servings). Cabbage mixed peppers carrot celery with an oil and vinegar dressing spiced with mustard and dill makes for a lovely salad. You do need salt and pepper in the dressing too in my opinion. Enjoyed it a lot but I took a star off for too much dressing which is too sweet.",
