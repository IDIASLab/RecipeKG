I am also moving and wanted to use up some cans I had in the pantry so I made a totally canned version. I sauteed about two teaspoons of basil and about a tablespoon of garlic in two teaspoons of olive oil added a can of diced tomatoes 2/3 of a can of concentrated tomato soup and about 2/3 of a can of artichoke hearts (drained and cut up). I heated it through and then added about half a cup of half and half. Heated till warm. I did add a little salt at the table. This soup was AMAZING!!! It was even better the next day when the flavors had time to settle! I am sure taking the time to follow the recipe will give you a great soup but the easy way was great too! I would not puree this soup as the chunks of artichoke and diced tomatoes give it great flavor and texture.",
