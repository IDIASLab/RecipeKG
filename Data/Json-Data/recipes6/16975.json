I also wanted a recipe that did not have any strange ingrediants preferably without the need for frosting AND a recipe for a 9X13 pan. I narrowed my search to this and for once my banana cake came out perfect!! This is the real thing better than store bought (the whole purpose!). Easy to prepare and only 30 mins! to bake! Most take an hour. VERY light and full of flavor. The cake is about 1 1/2\" high. I even registered to allrecipes just so I can rate this recipe! Thanks CAROLINE!",

I made three small substitutions; I used regular AP flour instead of cake flour (I did sift it with the other dry ingredients and when I googled it I did what was suggested and subtract three tablespoons for each cup of flour which really brought the flour amount to just under two cups) I used butter instead of shortening and I cut the sugar back to a scant 3/4 cup as my bananas were REALLY ripe. The batter looked as it should for muffins it baked up nicely and it tasted as banana bread should but these did turn out dry. If I make these again I'd cut back the flour a quarter cup or so or add an additional banana. 350 for 20 minutes was just right for me. I got 12 large muffins out of one recipe.",
