Tried this and it was delicious - the schnapps and wine definitely kicked it up a notch. I think we got a slight buzz off the soup! For newbie cooks - you definitely have to peel the peaches. Very simple - boil a large pot of water - drop in the peaches for a minute or two. Immediately put them in ice water for a few minutes. The skin comes RIGHT off. It is quick. Thanks submitter - I brought this soup to the office for lunch-I know it is going to make me smile!!!",

At first taste I could really taste the wine but then throughout the meal the wine flavor faded into the entire flavor of the soup. My roommate and I both came to the conclusion that this would make a nice dessert or would have to be placed with a well planned meal that would compliment the sweet flavor of the soup itself. I mentioned that I would like to peal the peaches next time but my roommate disagreed he liked having something to chew. My advice is if you like chewing your soup leave the peal if not definitely peal the peaches. I am really looking forward to making this recipe again!",
