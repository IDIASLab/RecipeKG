My taste buds are still talking... \"More More.\" I had three pieces before I called a halt to this new eating habit (and I might eat one piece before bedtime). I made ONE CHANGE to the recipe since I had no raisin nut bran cereal. I substituted it with 1-3/4 cup of raisin bran cereal and 1/4 cup of chopped pecan nuts. I will make more loaves and freeze them air-sealing with two layers of plastic wrap then one layer of aluminum foil. If my family and I don't eat them all before month's end I'll pass onto neighbors and friends. Try the recipe; you won't be disappointed. Thanks Scrubb for sharing it with us.",

I made a recipe almost similar to this years ago and was looking for something close. I read some of the reviews and let my cereal and milk soak for about ten minutes or so so it would be a little mushier. I also added about a half cup of organic raisins and a tsp. of vanilla. I'm so glad to have this recipe again. The person I'm gifting this to is going to love it. This is a chewier quick bread. NOTE: If you add raisins like me and want them to be a little plumper soak them in hot juice/water/soda for about 20 minutes. You'll have a fatter raisin and a little fruitier flavor to your loaf.",
