Great blend of spices and flavorings and doubly yummy with a little Jamaican rum and sour cream. Easy and the best beans ever to serve as your main dish with cornbread. You can substitute red beans for the pinto beans.",

I did have some changes, not because I wanted to, it\u2019s I couldn\u2019t find some ingredients - ground beef instead of ground pork, a can of diced tomato in tomato juice instead of tomato juice. The mistake I made was I didn\u2019t let beans soaked long enough like the recipe calls. They taste good but tender ones will be much better. This is a keeper. Will try it next time on camp fire.",
