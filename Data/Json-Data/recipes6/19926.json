You do not need to cook the potatoes beforehand provided you slice them thinly (I used my mandolin) and you bake the dish a bit longer (I did 1 hour covered 15 minutes uncovered). I also wouldn't use red potatoes since they don't get quite as soft as other types. I mixed some seasonings into the vegetable mixture (oregano parsley garlic salt and pepper) and used a basil tomato sauce. It was outstanding. Thanks for the concept!",

I used white potatoes cut very thinly (mandolin size) sliced zucchini in place of the carrots red pepper instead of the green and a cheese fondue mixture (we live in Switzerland so American cheeses are hard to come by). I added a container of cottage cheese and used seasoned tomato puree instead of the vodka sauce. So really a completely different recipe but very tasty.
