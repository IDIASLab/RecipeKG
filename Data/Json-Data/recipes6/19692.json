Each time I made it, everyone raved about the ribs, even scooping up the last drop of juice and and pouring it over their rice.  Since I do not have a grill, I cooked the ribs in the oven.  I used aluminum foil to seal the ribs like a tent and gave it more of a steam effect so that they came out very tender; the meat was falling off of the bones.  I cooked it in 400 degrees for  1 1/2 to 2 hours.",

They were almost impossible to eat and mostly went to waste it was very disappointing.",

Instead of grilling I broiled the ribs for 7 minutes per side and then sliced them into medallions. They were so tender and flavorful and were a huge success at my party.
