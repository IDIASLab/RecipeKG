You can also try it as a quick snack over toasted bread. This recipe is much quicker to make if you use precooked canned beans, but I like to think that the authentic flavor comes from doing it the hard way!",

Use a strong robust black tea (Find a local Indian store and ask the clerk what their best tea is. For me it was Red Label orange pekoe) 3. Use a good amount of tea (about 1/8 cup per batch) 4. Don't split the beans in half just dump the whole can in your tea-water 5. Boil down the tea water to about half and throw everything else into this pot. (it helps to start the tea-water/chickpea process in a medium-large saucepan) One interesting variation is to add about 1/2c plain yogurt towards the end this will add a little tangy and give you more gravy to mix with your rice.",

First I reduced the amount of Chickpeas to one can while keeping the other amounts the same. I personally like this ratio better and it left lots of extra gravy for rice or naan. Next I used a high quality rich black tea to heat the chickpeas. Third it definitely needs the salt added. Don't underestimate this. Last I added a fair amount of cayenne to make it nice and spicy (again my preference).",

Perhaps it's that most of the spices only get added to the onions; the tomatoes get them indirectly and the chickpeas only get added to the spiced mixture near the very end. It's probably that combined with the tomatoes mellowing out the dish too much. The \"Chickpea Curry\" recipe on this site is better (and easier).",

In addition while it is mild in flavor this is a recipe that is easy to alter to your own taste. For a thicker more curry-like and spicier sauce just add some sour cream/nonfat plain yogurt curry and red pepper to taste. (Probably heavy cream could be used too.) Extra tumeric will give it that yellow color. Highly recommended especially if you like garbonzo/chickpeas. Use it as a base or enjoy experimenting. Either way it is delicious.",

I let it cook for another ten minutes so that all the chickpeas were soft. I served it on top of brown rice and it is delicious. Instead of a tea bag I used some loose Indian-spiced rooibos.
