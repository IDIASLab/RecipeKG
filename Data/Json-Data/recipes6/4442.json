When I've made risotto before it has always been difficult. A couple of suggestions: 1) mine took an extra quarter cup or so of broth; 2) I let the corners brown on my feta cheese because it intensifies the flavor. The cheese fit on a toaster oven-size sheet and I used a 3 qt. saut\u00e9 pan for the rice which fit everything perfectly. I will make this recipe again.",

                "reviewBody": "I gave this recipe full rating because I believe in it but I had a horrible time. It was my first risotto plus I doubled the recipe for 8. I couldn't find fresh pumpkin so I used butternut squash and a can of pumpkin. I cubed the squash steamed it (too long) and then baked as suggested. I cooked the risotto as directed. Toward the end I added a large can of pumpkin (3.5 cups). In a sudden the dish went bland. I then added more salt but it was boring so I added some garam masala. Everything was great again. I stirred in cubed butternut squash spinach and garnished with feta and remaining squash. The presentation was beautiful the taste excellent - but when it came time to serving this dish (5 hours later) it was very mushy. The aram masala was slightly overbearing. The dish was no longer great. I suspect it was too much canned pumpkin w/o benefit of salt/pepper/olive oil baked in the oven. Possibly a small can of pumpkin would be better but I would only add to taste (I'm not yet convinced canned pumpkin will work). I would make sure the cubes are firm as recommended because I think this added to the overall mush. Keep garam masal to a sprinkle and then add to taste (it was truly delightful). I have since been told risotto must be served fresh. Is it true? As a dedicated pumpkin and risotto enthusiast I will definitely try this again.",
