They re not very appetizing looking and neither taste very good either. But not this time! While these still leave a lot to be desired in terms of eye appeal the flavor is startlingly better than most. I reserved and crumbled the bacon I fried to create the required bacon grease and I think the addition was a bold flavor contribution as was the chopped green onion I garnished them with. This takes the lowly Mexican bean side dish to an elevated level. Just needs salt and pepper.",

What I did to make the mashing easier is to drain ALL of the liquid into a bowl (much easier when they're not swimming), use a stick blender to mash the beans, I like mine chunky,  add your seasoning and then add the liquid to the consistency you like.  Me, I like mine thick not runny like you get in most restaurants.  \n\nThese were absolutely delicious and I will never buy refried beans in a can again (they always taste like the can!) when these are so simple and tasty.  Remember to add the salt, this has none listed.  I usually make 4 to 6 cans at a time so I don't have to make them as often.  \n\nA substitution for bacon fat is lard.  It will give the same mouth feel but not overwhelm the flavor with smoke from the bacon.  Still just as good but more appropriate with certain dishes.  I keep the lard in a jar in the fridge so it won't spoil.",

I have made a similar recipe but it didn't have the extra garlic and onions. The only change I made was using butter with canola oil for the fat instead of bacon grease. My beans were a little on the thin side and that might be why. I am waiting for them to cool to see if they thicken up some. I am also going to try it next time with low sodium beans since the liquid in the can is so salty. Thank you",
