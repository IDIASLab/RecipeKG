I met a wonderful Hawaiian lady named Nalani at an event here in Maui. She was selling her banana bread. After taking the first bite I knew this was something special. She was so happy with how much I loved her banana bread she happily shared the recipe. Best served warm and fresh from the oven. Aloha!",
