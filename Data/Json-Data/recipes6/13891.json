If you are using crunchy chow mein noodles add them at the last minute and if you think there will be left overs only add the crispy noodles to what you are going to eat.

As for my self I liked it but I could probably do without the bacon (I'm probably the only person on earth that doesn't love bacon). I did everything as the recipe ask except for the dressing.
