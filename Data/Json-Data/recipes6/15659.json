First I whip up the egg in the blender then add the rest of the wet ingredients and blend quickly.  Then add the mixed dry ingredients to the blender and use the stir cycle until well mixed. Then I pour it directly onto the waffle iron.  I add extra milk to thin out the batter if it needs it.  Easy! and a nice treat.  Enjoy.",

This is a nice sweet I know it sounds like alot of sugar but it all balances out. I will definately use this recipe again!",

Now never even eating anything but Eggos and hubby buying me a waffle maker for Christmas, the first time I made this recipe I following the directions exactly and they were good but they weren't \"OMG these are amazing!\" ... Which is why I gave this 4 stars.. Today I made this recipe again but this time I followed the suggestions in the reviews.. I used 4 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) just b/c it's easier than have a alittle bit of butter left over to put away in the fridge, and 1 3/4 cup milk to make it just alittle easier to pour. Today's batch was amazing!!! What a difference! Now it's a 5 star recipe! And everyone wanted more! Also... another tip.. The first time I made this I shifted the flour and I beat the egg whites and yolks separately to make fluffier waffles b/c that's all you see online about how to make fluffy waffles. But it was alot of work so today I didn't do any of that and they were the same texture/fluffiness, so don't waste your time doing those extra steps. ENJOY!!!",

I made these waffles exactly as the recipe said and they were limp and soggy, even after laying them out on a paper towel, and they tasted heavily of salt and baking soda. I was very disappointed because all the reviews made them sound wonderful.  \n\nConspiracy Theory: I've gone through the reviews for this recipe and the \"too much baking soda\" complaint is restricted to the last three reviews. I wonder if someone hacked into the recipe database and changed the amount of baking soda in the recipe so that poor, unsuspecting cooks would have their waffles ruined. Breakfast-related mayhem ensues and the evil hacker goes on to mess up other recipes. Think about it.    ",

Having said that, all I know is hubby and I enjoyed our breakfast this morning! In comparing this recipe with other similar recipes, including the one included in the manual, this one called for twice the amount of salt, so I reduced it by half keeping all other ingredients and measurements the same, and beat the eggs well to lighten them up. The waffle was crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside, with good flavor. My only criticism, and certainly no fault of the recipe, is that my waffle maker anyway, cooks unevenly, with some parts of the waffle browning more than others. Maybe it just takes practice spreading the batter? ",
