It lists 1 1/2 cups of water, and then again 1 cup of water.  2 1/2 cups of water for 6 cups of flour does not make a stiff dough, it was almost like thick cake batter.  Also, it lists sugar, 2 separate places in the recipe, however when you add the ingredients, it does not specify where the 2nd sugar ingredient goes.  I would love to have a recipe similar to this, one that works. Thanks.",
