I had an open bottle of white wine, so I used the last of it (~2/3 cup) in place of some of the milk, and it added a really nice bit of acidity. I added the wine to the roux and let it cook for few seconds so it wouldn't curdle the milk, and then whisked in the milk. This makes a huge batch, which was fine because the leftovers are delicious, but I think next time I'll try a half recipe. I only had water-packed tuna and it was fine.",
