        "description": "This relatively simple recipe makes a lovely presentation as a side or main dish. Delicata squash is a mild squash similar to butternut, which is a suitable replacement squash if you cannot find delicata. This is a great recipe for experimentation. Consider adding to your turkey mixture: red bell pepper, curry, or pine nuts. For a filler, you could add brown, white, or wild rice. Or experiment on your own. Enjoy!",
