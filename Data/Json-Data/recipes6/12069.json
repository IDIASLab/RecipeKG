One thing I do that solves the problem of too much frosting is I make the hole for the cherry larger so it takes more frosting, and then after baking I spread another spoon or so on top of the baked cookies,this makes them prettier and uses all the frosting, plus they are really scrummy with the extra frosting.  The uncooked frosting that you put on the warm cookies after baking is just as good as the first that is spread on before baking.  These cookies rock, they are the BEST cookie there is, if you like chocolate and cherries you will LOVE this cookie.  :)  P.S. I also sometimes add an extra egg, this makes the cookies soft and chewy, I like them better this way.",

These are incredibly good and remind me of the cookies we get at the mall.\r\nThese will definitely be made again and join my Christmas cookie trays.",

I took them to a bake sale and many people asked for the recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes: 1) doubled the batter but not the chocolate sauce 2) used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown sugar 3) placed the cherry in the center of the cookie immediately after I took them out of the oven and 4) drizzled the chocolate on after the cookie cooled. I also cut the cherries in half before inserting them into the center just to stretch the jar of cherries. (I'm glad I did or I would have run out of cherries.)The only problem I encountered was that my cookie dough was too soft and sticky to roll because the overzealous cherry lover in me added a little too much cherry juice to the batter. I remedied that by just dropping the batter onto the cookie sheet like a drop cookie then using a spoon to \"swirl\" them into a round shape.",

First off - the recipe is very poorly written and I'm surprised it passed the All Recipes review process - the yield states 18 cookies?  I got 5 dozen - and followed the receipe exactly as written. They taste like a mediocre chocolate cookie with a cherry stuck in the middle.  I used Ghirardelli cocoa and that didnt' help at all.  The frosting makes ENTIRELY too much - I have at least a cup and half left over.  The cookies stick to the sheets if even a drop of the frosting overflows and the cookie then falls apart.  You might want to mention that they need to cool for a minute or two before attempting to remove them at all - but don't let them cool too much or they will stick to the pan and fall apart when trying to remove them.  Horrible recipe and a very bland cookie.  Sorry but this is the worst recipe I've ever tried from this site and I've used this site almost daily for close to 8 years!",
