For those of you who don't like it so tart, but don't want to add more sugar, you can try a species of rhubarb called 'Strawberry' or 'Cherry.'  Most people have what's called 'Victoria.'  It's only red from the ground to about half-way up the stalk and is green for the rest.  The strawberry version is a dark red from the ground to the leaf.  The red version is much sweeter.  It is still rhubarb so it's still tart but not nearly as much as the 'Victoria.'",
