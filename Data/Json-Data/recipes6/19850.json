When you start boiling the mixture, take a pastry brush and a cup of water and brush the sides of the pan with the wet brush to wash down any sugar crystals. It only takes a couple of stray  crystals to make the whole pot crystalize so do a good job, but don't put too much extra water into your fudge. Also, you don't want to stir the fuge or jostle the pot until it cools.",

By letting it cool you'll get a fudge that is going to instantly turn before you can get it into the pan. Marbling is not an effect because the caramel is so dark already. If it does fail and turns to sand then just put the chunks into a microwave safe bowl and nuke for 2 minutes until it's bubbling again. Then pour hot mix into pan right away and you have an instant recovery!",

He said the coffee balanced the \"sweetness\" of the fudge (there ARE 3 cups of sugar in here!). Key is to NOT MOVE THE FUDGE while it's cooling from soft ball stage to room temperature. Just a little movement can cause the sugars to crystalize. Will definitely make this again perhaps for Christmas!:D",

I also added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I cooked to 236F removed from heat and added the chips right away. It took a lot of beating as it cooled but the result was a soft creamy fudge bursting with flavor. Will definitely make this next week to take to a bake sale at work!",
