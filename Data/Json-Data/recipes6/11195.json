Additionally, when you take the cheesecake out of the oven and set it on a cooling rack, set a timer for 10 minutes.  When the timer goes off, use a paring knife to gently separate the edge of the cheesecake from the pan.  Continue to cool, and then chill 5 hours or overnight.  The cheesecake will not crack and will easily come free of the pan, and look picture-perfect!  Top with fresh whipped cream, (heavy whipping cream whipped with a dash of vanilla and just a tiny bit of powdered sugar).\n\nThanks to all of you who wrote your comments to use MUCH less lime in this recipe!  You saved me from making a drastic mistake, and now this recipe (with my alterations), is my favorite cheesecake recipe!",

For the crust increase melted butter to 6T and add 4 T coconut. Cake: Use 3- 8oz cream cheeses 4 eggs and 2/3 c. lime juice. I used Rose's sweetened lime juice avail. in the cocktail isles of grocery stores. Add 2 drops of blue food coloring to give a lime green color. Bake cheese cake in a hot water bath (put cake in larger pan and add boiling water to larger pan before baking). After 50 min.of baking open oven door and allow to cool in oven. Chill overnight. Garnish with 8 oz. cool whip grated lime rind and thin slices of lime. This looked beautiful and tasted even better!!",

In order to compensate for this I added an extra egg 1/2 tsp extra vanilla 1/4 cup more of sugar. And I used my own crust recipe. I kept the key lime juice the same however and found it more than adequate in the tartness department. Note to anyone using fresh key limes: It will take about 20 key limes to equal 3/4 cup of juice. Popping them in a bowl in the microwave for about 15 seconds will help them to release more juice when squeezed. I used a fork to pulverize the membranes as well. Although it does seem like I changed a lot the methods involved in the preparation are sound and the taste yields a very refreshing tang.",

Changes: For the crust I did use 5 tablespoons of butter. For the filling: I used 3 boxes of cream cheese about a 1/2 cup of key lime juice (I tasted it at 1/4 cup and it just wasn't \"limey\" enough) and about a 1/3 cup powdered sugar too. I used 2 drops of green food coloring that gave the finished product a lovely color - just be sure to mix very well or you will have green stripes! Did not bother with the hot water bath. It turned out just fine with two very minor cracks. I will be making this again for Christmas and I may try the coconut as others have suggested. I'll let you know how that works out.

I also use chocolate graham crackers for the crust and sprinkle a bit more toasted coconut on top of filling before baking. Very yummy cheesecake!\nUpdate 11/2/10: When making this for the 5th time - when the oven temp is reduced, I accidentally dropped it to 350 instead of 250 for 30 minutes. I turned the oven off & let it be for an hour. Still turned out great even with oven temp mistake. I may do that again, haha. No cracks either.",
