I may have added a touch more mushrooms and shallot than it called for but that's normal for me. Very good! Thanks!",

Next time I will use less liquid as it was too moist (my normal quinoa recipe calls for less than 2:1 water to grain so I should have held back). Other than that great! and it dried out overnight to a better consistency. I can see this being a go-to recipe because of all its healthy ingreds (3 of the GBOMBS!). No reason not to increase the mushroom and shallot amounts. Also I think any sliced shrooms will do fine.",
