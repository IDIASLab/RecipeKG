The dough was extemely dry and had to be warmed in my hand for a minute before it would form into a ball, and then it just would not spread into a cookie. I don't have money to waste on ingredients and that's exactly what happened. I should have stuck with the well known Jif blossom recipe. I have no idea what happened. Honestly. Not when I followed the recipe exact. EDITED: Wish I would have read through the reviews and known that I was supposed to add two tablespoons of milk to the cookie recipe. I was able to salvage part of the dough, thank goodness, but that's after I added milk to the dough.",
