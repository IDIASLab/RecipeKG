I do think it can be done with a couple less flips but in the end, who cares? When I pulled the burgers from the skillet to rest, there was this yummy pan juice that I couldn't let go to waste. I sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms in it and then added a can of beef gravy. It was similar to something my mom did growing up and it really hit the spot. The next time I plan on grilling burgers but it is pouring down rain outside, this will be the recipe I make.",
