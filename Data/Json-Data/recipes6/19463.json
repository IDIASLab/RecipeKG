The muffins rose nicely were very fluffy and not dense. They were just faintly sweet which which i prefer (i don't have much of a sweet tooth). i used paper liners and the only drawback was that the muffins stuck to the liners. next time i would use a non-stick spray. but overall great recipe to start with. i've included a picture as well.",

I substituted molasses for the raisins because my kids won't eat them and used an egg replacer.
