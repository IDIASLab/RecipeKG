I do not care for mincemeat pie and made a quick fruitcake recently with mincemeat pie filling and did not like it that way either. I wanted to use what was leftover of it. It appears though it works well in cookies. When mixed into the batter the apples and raisins separate and can actually be tasted individually and the spice is really mild. They go great with the walnuts too. The base of this cookie reminds me somewhat of a chocolate chip cookie so it pares well. Only change I made was using butter instead of shortening. I also made 1/2 recipe and with a cookie scoop it yielded 42 cookies. I baked them on a parchment lined sheet and they took 12 minutes. Mine were a little flat after cooling so an extra minute may have been even better. ty",
