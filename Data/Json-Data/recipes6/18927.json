The prep time has made it take over an hour before, depending on how many vegetables I chop up and mix in (e.g. carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, bell pepper, mushroom, green onion) or if I need to de-bone the meat.  I would also suggest adding peanuts to the sauce.  Using the original recipe, i.e. boneless skinless meat and not chopping any veggies, this is superfast and easy.  When cooking the rice, I like to add a little soy sauce and/or Szechuan seasoning to the rice water for flavor.",

I would suggest that you use a deep fryer to do the frying.  It stuck to my pan and burned, the cornstarch I am guessing.  Then after the meat is fried add the garlic and other ingredients.  I also only put in a dash of the pepper as my youngest and I really do mix well with alot of heat.  I will most definitely be using this recipe over and over again.  Thank you so much for sharing.",
