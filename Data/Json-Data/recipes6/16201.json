I cut back the sugar in half and next time I think I'll omit it altogether.  We added a drizzle of maple syrup to the top after serving and it was great.  I did as others suggested and cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then 5 more minutes after adding the cheese and bacon to the top.  It deflated a bit when I took it out of the oven and set it down, so be careful, or just add the bacon and cheese while it's in the oven.\n\nMy 9 year-old son says, \"I loved it.  It was great!  We cut it into slices and I ate mine like pizza!  I helped Mom mix stuff together.\"",

It has common ingredients and comes out light with a hint of maple and all the cheese and bacon on the top is amazing. It comes out of the oven with great wow power like it was made in an expensive restaurant. The basic recipe make 4 servings but easily can be doubled for more hungry folks. I find it very flavorful and filling. Topped with real maple syrup it is a real winner. I am going to experiement a bit with my cast iron frying pan and cover it with tin foil to see if we can get it to work for summer camping trips.",

I think that next time I will try using maple sausage cooked and crumbled mixed in the batter instead of the bacon. I did take the recommendation of not using the additional sugar and I think I am glad I did - the maple flavor was pleasing without being too sweet (and you could always serve extra syrup at the table for those who have a sweet tooth). Also the cheese on top didn't do anything for us - will eliminate a few calories next time. And cooking time and temperature was way off - I baked at 375 and it still took 30 minutes. Thanks for a good starting point. 5/08 - made this again but with maple sausage and mozzarella instead of cheddar - much improved flavor at least to our liking. Kept everything else the same - no sugar other than the syrup mixed everything together 375 degrees no cheese on top -- a wonderful breakfast! I will serve this for Thanksgiving breakfast - my stepmother doesn't like eggs or sweet things for breakfast (but she does like waffles and pancakes) so this will work just fine!",
