I didn't have all the individual spices so I added 4 tsp Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead.  I used olive oil in place of the butter for a more Italian flavor, added 5 Tbsp grated Parmesan instead of 3, and reduced the yeast to 2 tsp.  ALSO, I noticed several comments about the bread falling.  When using cheese in automatic bread machines, be sure that it is mild.  Sharp cheese can cause the dough to rise too quickly and then collapse due to the enzymes that some sharp cheeses contain.  Hope this helps!",

(making the bread the \"old fashioned way\" I used all purpose flour and set it in a greased bowl in a warm spot left to rise for about 45 minutes kneeded it for about 5 min. Then put them in greased (shortening) pan. (I used mini loaf pans) and let rise for about 30 minutes. It ony took about 20 minutes to bake. ( I kept checking)",

I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed it with the stand mixer using the dough hooks. Then I kneaded it for 6 or 7 minutes and put it in an oiled bowl to rise until doubled in size. After it doubled, I punched it down and put it back in the bowl to rise a little more. 20 minutes or so later I put it on a lightly greased baking sheet, forming it into a French bread-shape. I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 or 35 minutes until it was a lovely golden color. It needs more seasoning and cheese, but I did alter the recipe a lot. I'll play with it some more so it's more to my family's taste, maybe add some olives. :) It turned out pretty yummy though! Thanks for the recipe!",

I did use the italian seasonings with the basil and a T. of garlic powder. Set the machine for the dough cycle and made balls of the dough when it was ready. I rolled the balls in a stick of melted butter with a little garlic powder mixed in and placed about 5 dough balls in each of 24 muffin cups sprinkled with the remaining butter and some more parmesan. They were terrific. A dozen are going to work for a bake sale and the rest (what there are!) stay here. My bread machine will make a 2# loaf so I will try to scale it up to make a few more rolls next time. Thanks.",

I'll probably use a little less yeast in future as the bread grew until it pressed the top of the machine, but keeping everyone on tiptoes and out of the kitchen prevented any falling, so the end product had a wonderful airy texture.  I also added garlic (1 teaspoon) and substituted Romano cheese (4 tablespoons for even more flavor) for Parmesan.  Went perfectly with tomato basil soup and club sandwiches!",
