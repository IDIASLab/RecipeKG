It's the cornmeal that comes to the top and browns that gives this appearance.  \r\nMy great-grandmother's recipe calls for only 3 eggs and only 1 1/2 cups sugar.  My mother always removes her pies when a butter knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.  For those of you who have slightly runny centers, when you turn off the oven... leave the pie inside until the oven is cool. As far as I've ever been able to tell.. you can't dry out a Chess Pie.  And for those whose pies cracked on top, this is fairly common. Sometimes mine crack, sometimes not.  May have to do with humidity and that sort of stuff.\r\nFinally, for those knocked out by the sweetness.. Chess Pie is a traditional down-home Southern Pie. If it ain't sweet, it ain't dessert.  I only wonder why T.Knecht put any topping on at all.  Never had it with topping... don't guess I ever will. Hope I helped.  God Bless!!!",

This pie recipe is very typical and delicious for one of the custard-type pies.  Try using heavy whipping cream rather than evaporated milk, this will help with the texture and the cracking.  Also, PRE-HEAT your oven to 450 degrees, place pie plate on a cookie sheet, place in oven and immediately turn oven down to 350 degrees and bake 45-50 minutes.  The top will be a medium brown as the cornmeal surfaces and browns, and the pie should be set.  I had no problems with it and my family absolutely loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

One of the reasons I searched for so long was that I didnt realize the one very simple fact that set my family pies apart from the \"recipe pies\" - the commotion.  There was always so much going on in our house during the holidays that this pie was made, that the pie always fell.  Every Chess pie (we call it Vinegar Pie) Ive ever had in 22 years has been flat!  I would recommend stomping to anyone else who has this same tradition.  Also, leaving your pie in the oven while the oven cools is truly the best way to set the center, and the top is SUPPOSED to be brown and cracked.",

I have never heard of using evaporated milk, so I substituted buttermilk instead, and I also used 1 C white sugar, 1 C brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness.  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers to guarantee my pie filling set up nicely.  I heated the oven to 450 F and once I put the pie in, immediately lowered it to 350 F.  I ended up cooking mine for 50 minutes and left the pie in the oven the entire time it was cooling down.  Afterwards, I put it in the fridge for 15 minutes, and it turned out the perfect consistency.  Since this pie has to cook for so long, I would recommend putting tinfoil over the exposed crust, unless you like the edges browned.  My husband prefers browned crust, so I just brush mine with half-and-half before cooking and leave them uncovered.",

As the directions state everything is stirred together. No whisking. only stirring. I do not put cornmeal in my pie. This is a good sugar pie. Years ago it was said that the name was Jess Pie....or Just Pie..there are a lot of old stories as far as the name goes. However I have been eating Chess Pie for over 50 years and this is a good recipe. There is also another name...Transparent Pie...regardless of what it is called...baking until a knife comes out clean is the way I was taught to bake it. This pie cooked at the right time and temp that were recommended in the original directions and I used the ingredients that were called for other than leaving out the cornmeal. I make this pie for Thanksgiving and Christmas and the forks are ready long before the pie is cool enough to eat. I always make 2 or 3 as I know how special this pie is for our family holidays. It makes no difference how many other desserts show up these pies go out first...I do cover the edges with foil; as I don't like a burned crust or even too brown. It is an old Southern pie recipe and it was made when there were very few ingredients available to even make a pie. Just Pie.",
