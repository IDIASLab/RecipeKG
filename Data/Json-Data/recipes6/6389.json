Actually this recipe turned out better than I expected. I used blue cheese crumbles instead of the dressing and baked in the oven until the cheddar cheese browned. I had to increase oven temp to 400 to brown. I will definitely make this again. Great for a relatively low carb dinner! Thank you for sharing!",
