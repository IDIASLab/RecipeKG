Very simple to make and it was super tasty. We had some friends over for dinner and everyone loved it so much that we all had at least seconds! I followed the recipe pretty closely except I was out of cumin so I used cayenne pepper. I also used Italian diced tomatoes and fiesta tomato soup instead of plain diced tomatoes and tomato soup. I will definitely make this again especially when we have leftover turkey. It is much better than plain old turkey soup. ",

I used a double batch of Bill Echols taco seasoning (cutting way back on the salt and chili pepper)and instead of using water and bouillion cubes, I used low sodium chicken broth. I also added the cilantro to the soup about 15 minutes before serving and added a couple tbsp. of fresh lime juice. The condensed soup added a nice creamy flavor and thickened up the soup just enough. This was easily adapted for the crockpot and was a nice inviting smell after a long, cold day. Great with Amusement Park Cornbread and a nice cold Dos Equis. My only issue with this is my family didn't care for it. This makes quite a bit for one person to eat on her own, unless you freeze it in lunch sized portions. Be sure your family likes taco soup.",
