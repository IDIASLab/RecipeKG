Let it sit in fridge for about 3-4 hours with rub before browning-I pierced both sides with fork then rubbed in olive oil. Used same pan I browned meat in to roast tenderloins in oven. I had a high quality balsamic vinegar which I\u2019m sure helped with taste.  Will definitely make again.",

After reading about the crock pot recipe and how it usually overcooked the meat, I sought out a recipe that would tell me the proper cooking time for the oven. \nI used a single 2-pound pork loin instead of two smaller ones, which resulted in a slightly longer cooking time but it was still under an hour. \nI don't like sage so I used 1 tsp of ground thyme instead, which worked very well. Otherwise I followed the recipe. \nWe had it with sour cream balsamic sweet potatoes and salad. It was an excellent dinner.\nI used a meat thermometer stuck in the end of the loin while it was cooking, set to 145 degrees and it worked perfectly. The meat was juicy and not overcooked at all.",
