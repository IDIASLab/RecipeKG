After having used my flat bakeware for other recipes, I had to bake it in a souffle baker - ok, so it would be a bit tall.\nWhen preparing the recipe, I beat the eggs in the mixer and made them super fluffy.  After soaking the matzoh, and following the directions to the letter (except I added extra raisins...mmmm, and used marg. instead of butter to serve with meat) , I ended up putting what looked like soup into the oven (I was a bit concerned at this point).\n\nLet me tell you.... I had to bake this a bit longer than the recipe called for because of the height of my baker, but what came out of the oven was an incredible, delicious sweet, moist kugel like I have never had.  I make this twice and brought it to two seders, and EVERYONE raved!  We couldn't stop eating it!\n\nI will be using this recipe all year round!!\n",

I used golden raisins and the first time I soaked them in water as the farfel was soaking in the water and then egg and the next time I soaked the raisins in sweet wine. It made them plumper. Definitely don't lose heart when your mixture is liquidy. It firms up quite nicely once baked! Next time I am adding chopped apple.",
