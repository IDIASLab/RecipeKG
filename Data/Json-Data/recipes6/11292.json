I think this recipe would be disastrous if a 9 oz. cake mix was actually used. Having said that I was very pleased with this cake as were about 10 other people who completely polished it off. Where margarine was called for I substituted butter. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling to give it a flavor boost however even with the vanilla the filling was still more fluffy and creamy than flavorful but it was perfect when considered as a whole with the finished cake. I made the cake in two 9\" layers with the filling thickly in between and it was definitely unique looking but baking this in three layers would probably have been easier to work with. Rather than the unsweetened chocolate in the glaze I used a fine quality bittersweet chocolate which I was pleased with. I whipped the ingredients rather than stirring them as I wanted a fluffy frosting rather than a glaze and it was enough to frost the entire cake. I finished it off with brown and white jimmies. A perfectly decadent dessert sensation!",

The key to this type of filling is that YOU MUST WHIP IT FOR 10 - 12 MINUTES.  The longer you mix, the creamier it gets.  If your filling is grainy, you just haven't mixed it enough. \nAnother great tip about this cake is that it freezes well.",

For the person who said the filling tastes like Crisco, maybe they've never eaten real Ho-Hos before, because they taste like Crisco too. :-)  If you have difficulty spreading the chocolate over the white filling, you should take a couple of precautions.  First, make sure your milk and flour mixture is quite thick when you cook it.  It should be about the consistency of soft margarine.  Next, make sure you refrigerate the cake & filling layer for at least an hour prior to spreading the frosting.  Finally, gradually add the powdered sugar when making the chocolate frosting so that you don't make it too thick.  When you put the frosting on top of the white filling, drop it by the tablespoon all over the top of the cake.  (There should be enough frosting to almost cover the entire cake using this mechanism.)  This will simplify the spreading process and make spreading the frosting easy.  Overall, a nice chocolate cake recipe that I would definitely make again.",

As another suggested chill the cake well & then drop spooonfuls of frosting all over the cake gently spread until covered. Follow the directions as stated for the filling dont skip the flour/milk part its strange but it DOES work. Use Crisco not the cheaper stuff in this recipe you get out what you put in. Finally... its a HoHo cake the filling tastes exactly like its namesake so if you dont like HoHos then dont bother. I personally have never had a crumb left over when I take this anywhere.",

Cool and put in freezer for about 10 minutes. Cut in half put half on your cake plate. set other half aside. Filling: melt 1/2 the butter in sauce pan turn off heat add flour and use whisk to stir well turn heat back on low add milk slowly whisking constantly. When the consistancy of thick pudding take off heat and continue stirring. Let cool. Beat the rest of your butter with Crisco & sugar. Add cooled milk mixture. Beat it on med high. Add a touch of vanilla. Slow beaters down to low and whip until you feel it's fluffy enough. It's not going to fluff like a meringue just be light and creamy. Put cream filling on top of cake spreading evenly and level put in freezer for about 10 minutes. Put other half of cake on top....frost as desired.",
