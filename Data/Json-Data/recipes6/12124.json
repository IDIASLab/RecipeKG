OF WATER OR MILK, as the dough is a bit too dry. I also always add an extra couple tsps., maybe even tbsp. of PB. Works every time. The dough should not looked cracked when you roll it, it should look like playdo. In addition, I cut both types of sugar down to 1/3 c. & they always come out fine. The middles are very sweet, so there's no need for that much sugar in the chocolate dough. With time, you become experienced at assembling these & eventually you'll be so good at it that you won't have any leftover PB balls, because you'll be able to handle more PB in the center, which makes them so much better!!!",

But I didn't give up & found that if I really flatten the dough and then wrap it it works better. I think next time I make these I will chill the peanut butter middles before wrapping the dough around them. (Oh yeah I too was left with more middles than dough lol!!)

I made the filling first and stuck it in the fridge while mixing up the cookie batter. Based on suggestions and opinions here I added 2 T. sour cream to the batter and to make it more chocolatey I added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Once that was done I then rolled the filling into balls and put them back in the fridge. I floured my hands and made small patties in the palm of my hand with a dent in the middle for the filling put the filling in and then rolled them like when you make meatballs. No filling seeped out 30 cookies and incredibly delicious. I am just trying to figure out how to hide them from the kids and me before handing out to friends and family.",

I'd even give them five stars except they were a pain to make. I even tried to flatten the chocolate dough and plop a peanut butter mixture on top then wrap around. Still pretty hard to cover the peanut butter. My chocolate dough didn't turn out too crumbly but I followed the directions EXACTLY and I realize that by mixing the wet ingredients into the dry VERY thoroughly with my kitchenaid they went from dry to moist - maybe this is the problem others are running into they are undermixing. Anyhow They cracked when I flattened so for that reason alone I may add a little extra water or maybe a couple of tblspoons of sour cream to avoid that. The end result was worth the effort! Don't skip the sugar on top...and these go great with milk.",

I rolled both dough and filling (both chilled) into logs and cut into 30 pieces but assembling still took an hour. It was hard for me to get the dough around the filling without it splitting and letting a bit leak out. Mine all cracked on baking so you can see a web of the filling through the chocolate cookie. I read the reviews and the suggestion to freeze the centers sounds like it could make things a bit easier. They are very tasty but I won't make them frequently. I overbaked mine going by appearance I didn't think they were done after the specified baking time so I added a few minutes but now that they are cooled they are hard and a bit dry so next time I'll follow the timing in the recipe.",

To form the cookie I took a small amount of dough and flattened it in my palm. If its too sticky add more flour. If the flattened disc is bigger than your palm the finished cookie will be too big. Drop the chilled filling in the middle and fold over and crimp. Place the crimped side down and don't forget to flatten the cookie on the baking sheet just a bit.",

DEFINITELY MAKE THESE they are soooo yummy IF you make the following minor changes: 1) add 2 more TBSP of cocoa powder 2) substitute 1/4 c of melted semi sweet chocolate for the 1/4 c of peanut butter that goes into the cookie dough 3) lessen the flour slightly (I used 1 1/4 cup 2 TBSP) 4) add a pinch of salt to the dough and 1/8 tsp of salt to the peanut butter middle (REALLY enhances the flavor of both the choc & pb...brings the recipe from a 5 in flavor to a 10!!) 5) Lastly make the peanut butter middle batter FIRST portion out into balls using a round bottom tsp place on a plate and (as suggested by several other bakers) FREEZE while you make the choco cookie dough - by the time you're done w/the dough your pb balls with be firm enough to stuff into the middle of it. THEN dip a round bottom TBSP into flour msr out a ball of choco dough then as other reviewers helpfully suggested flatten the ball in your hand put the pb ball into the middle and simply fold the edges up and roll like you would a meatball. EZ!!...IF you do it this way...if not you're going to be frustrated beyond belief! Thanks for posting Stephanie - i'll be making this one for years to come:)",
