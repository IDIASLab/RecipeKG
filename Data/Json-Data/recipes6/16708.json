After several batches, I made a few changes.  I increased the vanilla to 2 - 2 1/2 tsp & only used 1/4 to 1/2 tsp lemon extract.  I also reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Also, don't overmix the dough after adding the dry ingredients.  After making a batch, I usually refrigerate for 1-2 hours.  I also rolled the dough balls in sugar before flattening the cookies.  I baked the cookies for 8-9 minutes depending on the cookie sheet.  Clients went crazy over the cookies, especially those who like a crisper sugar cookie. Also, clients liked the reduced lemon & increased vanilla changes.  I use the Chewy Sugar Cookie recipe for clients who like a chewy cookie.  These cookies are great for decorating with frosting, cinnamon/sugar or colored sugars.",

One thing I would be sure to add, though, is NOT to substitute shortening for butter, and to be certain to keep the butter cool enough to not melt it while mixing.  Without the emulsifying power of the lecithin in butter, you're basically going to have an oil slick on top of your wet ingredients, and nothing is really going to bring it back together.  Margarine probably works as a substitute, as it also has lecithin in it.  Some cookie recipes benefit from shortening or melted butter -- not this one!",

My (then 6 years old) daughter loved them so much that they became a family tradition. They are crispy and light, and melt in your mouth good!! Keep them in an airtight container - if they last that long! : )  I've varied the flavorings over the years, too. Lemon, vanilla or almond.  All are great! Perfect for grandma's to keep in the freezer to bake when the grandkids come. I have rolled the balls and frozen them on a cookie sheet then bagged the balls for baking - just thaw on the cookie sheet - when you want just a few.  A wonderful cookie - but be careful, they are addictive!  Enjoy!\r\n",
