I tryed making them healthier by using light Mayonnaise, replacing half the sugar with Splenda, and replacing 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour with oat flour. Like one reviewer said, the dough is hard to work with. First it comes out very crumbly and then it turns very sticky making it a messy job to roll into balls. Secondly, if you are a cookie dough addict and you are using light mayo, hold off on eating it because it tastes nasty. And finally, really make sure you flatten the dough out well before baking because these cookies do not spread at all and they will burn on the bottom and be raw in the middle if you don't. Other than that they were very tasty.",

The mayo didn't skeeve me out, because I have a couple of great cake recipes using mayo. But the ease of making these belies the wonderful result. I grated the zest of one lemon and substituted lemon extract for the vanilla, and the result was a short, gently crispy, sable-textured lemon sugar cookie, good enough to put on your Christmas cookie trays. But they're equally at home as an after-school snack for the kids. I'm certain that the vanilla would be lovely, as well. The dough was quite manageable for me. Crumbly looking, but it balled up easily. Don't forget to flatten, as what you see for height going into the oven is more or less what you get coming out. I got just under 3 dozen, 32 to be precise. To avoid making a difficult, hard-to-work-with dough, be certain to spoon your flour into the measuring cup, (meaning don't scoop the flour into the cup) then sweep to level the top. If you're finding that your dough is unworkably stiff, you've added too much flour, which will happen if you scoop. As written, the measurements are correct. This recipe is a fabulous find!",
