However the amount does not make it too zucchini-ish. It is light in texture and plenty of spice and flavor. It makes 2 loaves. However this recipe takes a few extra steps...like beating the eggs and sugar an extra 5 mins alone and extracting the zucchini liquid. That saying this bread takes a little longer to prepare than the usual quick bread. But zucchini bread always is a little more time consuming due to all the shredding (you may want a food processor!). I originally thought that it was going to take a long time to extract the liquid from the zucchini but it really went pretty fast. I did the zucchini first and by the time I was done with assembling the other ingredients and stuff it was ready to put in the colander and use. That in mind it is a really tasty zucchini bread that is worth the few extra steps. Enjoy...we sure do!",

I saw this recipe and it looked different from the rest in that you mix the salt with the zucchini to get rid of its moisture. I was so delighted. I made it in a bundt pan and whipped up a simple sour cream powdered sugar heavy whipping cream mixture to drizzle on top. My restauranteur friends helped themselves to 2nds and 3rds of this bread. It was moist not too sweet easy to make and didn't have too many preparations. I threw in some freshly ground nutmeg but just because I love that particular spice. If you are looking for a simple good recipe...I definitely recommend this one. It's worth the zucchini!",
