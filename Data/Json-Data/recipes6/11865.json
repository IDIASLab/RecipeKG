The lemon is great and although I wouldn't have picked out the black pepper flavor if I didn't know it was in there it has a great aftertaste. While I was making these I was sure I needed to add something. I considered adding baking powder or vanilla or lemon flavoring- don't do it. They're great as is. The only changes I made were to accidentally add the egg yolk along with the whole egg in the dough (oops used another egg yolk for the wash) and I didn't have any crystal sugar so I sprinkled with granulated sugar. Great cookie!",
