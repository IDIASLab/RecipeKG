(Use powdered sugar for the glaze and increase by 2 tablespoons to thicken or else it's too runny and will run right off the cake)  It's VERY soft coming out of the oven, so once it's cooled, cover it and refridgerate for a few hours or overnight to let it set or it will break coming out. It sets up like a bread the next day. And this is one recipe where adding too much blueberries will work against you.  I've tried 1 1/2 - 2cups and it was way too much.  Ended up with blueberry cake and too much juice inside.  As the recipe suggests, use 1 to 1 1/4 cups, no more.  I have used frozen blueberries with no problem.  Be sure to coat berries in flour (fresh or frozen) to prevent them from sinking too much.  Most of them sink anyway, but a little flour does help. Use quality bottled lemon juice and it will taste just as good.  With frozen berries, I had to bake for almost 70 min. I've also put a brown sugar struesel on top when I want a little extra crunch and sweetness.  **Tip - in the last 10 min. of cooking, brush the top with some of the glaze and put it back in the oven.  The bread absorbs the glaze in the oven and won't be too wet.  Brush on remaining glaze once it's done.",

The only I might change the next time is reducing the lemon flavor just a bit, so that it doesn't overpower the blueberry taste.  I think the last time I made this, I had pecans on hand, so that was what I used.  I think the nut aspect is a personal decision, whichever you want to use.  This time, I have walnuts so that will go in it.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that using powdered sugar would be a good idea for the glaze the first time I made this and seeing a review from someone else with this suggestion means I will have to try that as well.\r\n",

The first time I made this recipe all the blueberries sunk to the bottom (even though I dredged them in flour) and a big chunk of the loaf stuck to the bottom of the pan. SO, the next time, I put only half of the blueberries into the batter, then poured half in the pan, sprinkled with blueberries, poured the rest in the pan and finshed off the top with the last sprinkle of blueberries. Turned out perfect.  Both times I brushed on the glaze about 10 minutes after I took the bread out of the oven.",

I have a couple tricks though, that puts this loaf at 5 stars! First, add the lemon juice to the milk and let it sit while you prepare the other ingredients, this will make a buttermilk. Second, add the lemon zest to the sugar first and stir it around with a fork, this will release the lemon oils into the sugar and give it more flavor. If using frozen berries, toss the blueberries with a little flour to coat before adding to the batter, this way the berries will not sink to the bottom of the pan. I have made this several times following the ingredient amounts exactly and it always works out great!",

Because so many reviewers were raving about this \"bread\" seeming more like a cake, I decided to increase the recipe by half and bake it in a 9\" round pan. I followed the recipe exactly, only doing a bit of improv with the glaze. Firstly, I kept the sugar/lemon juice proportions outlined in the recipe, the only thing I did was add a couple teaspoons of grated lemon peel to the sauce, then popped it in the microwave until it was boiling. I did this so that the glaze would be more like a syrup, and because it was so watery and grainy without being cooked. The added lemon peel makes the glaze taste just like candied lemons, and what I did was drizzle on top of the cake during the last 10 minutes of baking. The cake didn't come out soggy at all! In fact, the glaze I made soaked nicely into the top and created a delcious, slightly crispy and shiny glazing to the whole thing, with little flecks of candied lemon peel here and there... Truly, a lovely presentation and the taste is out of this world!!! It's lemony, but also very blueberry and the combination is dynamite! Highly recommend this recipe!",

The bread baked up in about 60 minutes, and it looked picture perfect coming out of the oven. The lemon flavor is not too overpowering, and the lemon aroma is vaguely fragrant. Though the bread itself is dense, the taste is light and moist; the blueberries add a nice burst of flavor. I would make this again, especially as a side dish for an afternoon tea.",
