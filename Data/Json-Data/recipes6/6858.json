It had a nice deep smoky flavour, tender meat, lotsa yummy hominy, just a little background of spicy, and a good broth-to-goodies ratio. Some notes: It did take me about an hour or more to get to the first simmer, although I was going at a leisurely pace. I subbed 1/8 tsp allspice because I was out of cloves, and used whole cumin seeds crushed with my mortar & pestal. I topped it with fresh lime, cilantro, shredded mexican blend cheese, extra crushed Mexican oregano, chunks of avocado, and homemade tortilla strips with cumin & corriander. I wish I had cabbage though. I think the crushed oregano really put it over the top. IMO it didn't need the cheese. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!",

The thing I did differently was that I used hot instead of mild enchilada sauce, and also I used leftover broth from my freezer (from carne en su jugo).  I also cooked the pork roast whole and shredded it after it was cooked.  I also served mine with cabbage, onion, raddish, limes, tostadas and hotsauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I let it cook on low for 2 hours before adding the hominy, and then another hour on med-low and the pork was melt-in-your-mouth-fall-aparty!!!  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half though cause it makes a VAT, I froze half but it won't be in there long =)  Seved it with sliced radishes, avocado, sour cream, a lime wedge and fresh fried tortilla strips.  I know some people like cabbage in Posole, but I prefer it without... Heck, some people put pig's feet in there too but I won't be making that addition either!

I've made a few changes so the rating reflects that although I would rate it 4 stars when made as written (which I did the first time I made it. For my taste the hominy has a good \"bite\" but no flavor. So now I add 2 14.5oz. cans of white hominy and 2 14.5oz cans of sweet corn. I don't like to mess with all of those peppers on a normal weeknight so I substitute 1/2 cup of salsa verde for both types of peppers. I also use this recipe when I have leftover pork tenderloin to use up so I can skip that part of step 3 and just add the leftover pork with the stock. I think that I would like to try adding one more can of enchilada sauce in place of one cup of stock; I think the enchilada sauce kind of gets \"lost\" in all that broth so I'm going to give that a try the next time I make this. We serve it with tortilla strips shredded mild cheddar and sliced avocado. Love it!",
