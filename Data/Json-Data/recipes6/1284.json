I also put a rub on the pork of paprika garlic powder cayenne salt & onion powder before braising. The pork was fall apart tender. I personally prefer to make my own bbq sauce but the addition of the vinegar to the bottled sauce gave the sauce a nice tang and was a big hit with my husband. Thanks for the recipe!",

It was absolutely delicious so much so that when the family sampled it before I added the sauce they decided to have it without. We had roast potatoes & veg along with it. I did add the BBQ sauce to the leftovers the next day & had it along with homemade rolls & it went down a treat. Won't be looking for any other recipes for pulled pork. This is a keeper. Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.",
