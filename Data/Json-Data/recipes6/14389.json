Baking soda adds an \"easier bite\" to the peanut brittle, causing it to break when less force is applied. It also causes the sugar base around the peanuts to be opaque. It does this by \"foaming up\" and introducing small bubbles in the sugar syrup. If you desire a clearer almost transparent sugar base around the peanuts and a \"harder bite\", reduce or omit the baking soda. If you use roasted peanuts instead of raw, be careful not heat the mixture above 300-degrees F. or the peanuts may taste burned. Roasted peanuts can also be added at the end of cooking to prevent burning.  If you use salted peanuts, omit the salt in the recipe.\r\n",

A few tips: Be sure to have butter and baking soda measured out beforehand and waiting, (and butter softened) stir them in well to mix, but dont stir it to death. when it is foamy and pale, stir a few times more, and then stop. I doubled the recipe (a single recipie for a single household, double it to share with anyone) and used a half-sheet size (read: about 17\"x13\" with a lip on it about an inch tall. I covered the pan with extra-wide aluminum foil and buttered the  foil, and the sides of the foil. As soon as you are done stirring the stuff in, pour it onto the foil, and spread it out. I did this by picking the pan up and kind a shaking it around. If you try to spread it around like frosting, you'll end up breaking all those beautiful little bubbles that make it crunchy but light. Have fun!",

The only thing I would do differently is less peanuts. My sis-in-law liked the extra peanuts. So of course, I think it depends on what you like more, the candy or the peanuts. Very easy. By the way, have a pot of BOILING water that you can place your utensils in immediately to help with clean up.",

Since I live in a country where corn syrup is not available, I had to substitute light molasses for the corn syrup, which worked just fine.  \r\n\r\nA couple of suggestions--even though the amount of liquid is originally not very large, be sure you use a large pot since the extremely hot, sticky mixture foams up to many time its original size when the butter and baking soda are added.  Also, don't dump out the mixture onto the cookie sheet in just one place and expect you'll be able to spread the peanuts around evenly afterwards--you'll crush all the bubbles.  A better tactic would be to pour the mixture out onto the cookie sheet in a circular pattern so the peanuts are evenly distributed to begin with, then tilt the pan to get the liquid spread evenly.",

You definitely have to have the ingredients ready to go while you are making this, but don't let that scare you off.  Once you have done one or two batches, you definitely get a \"feel\" for the process.  Here are a couple of notes that might help.  First, USE A CANDY THERMOMETER.  I can't imagine being successful without this.  While stirring, the candy takes quite a little time to get to the desired temperature, and CONSTANT stirring is not necessary.  But WATCH OUT...once it gets to around 250 degrees it RAPIDLY shoots up to the 300 degree temperature and you need to be right on top of it.  I learned to let it stay at the 300 degree point for a bit to brown the candy and the peanuts.  It gave it a GREAT flavor, but BE CAREFUL!!!  Also, I added from one and a half to two cups of peanuts, and liked the consistency.  This mlay well be an annual tradition!",

I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar (which gave it a nice colour and taste) and I had dry roasted peanuts so I waited until my thermometer read 250 to add them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla when I added the butter and baking soda. Everyone was right, you do have to wait a while for it to get up to 250 but once it hits that it goes really fast. And you have to work fast at spreading it on the pan. I had my pan in the oven before hand as well to help. And to make it go even faster I put the pan outside in the cold air and it cooled in no time! I will definitly be making this again!",
