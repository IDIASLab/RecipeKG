So tender just the right amount of spice and came together in minutes plus of course the time on the grill. I WILL be making this one again! I should disclose that I did everything that the recipe called for but got them started in my Ninja 3-in-1 Cooking System. After that I took them to the grill to finish them and give them that smoky flavor. I then basted them with BBQ and they caramelized just beautifully. I am currently living in a hotel while we are building a home and there is a grill here for the guests. Since it has been raining off and on all day today making them in the Ninja then finishing them on the grill seemed to be my best bet. I was able to get them on and off the grill between showers! I LOVE this recipe!",

I followed the recipe for the seasoning choosing instead to put the ribs on my electric smoker. I smoked them for 4 hours between 225 and 250 degrees and they were done. Mine were firm to the tooth but not tough or stringy really enjoyable. Bonus: doing these outside on the smoker instead of partially cooking them in the oven kept all the heat out of the kitchen. I'll definitely do these again!",
