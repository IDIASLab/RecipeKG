I used equal parts of the sugar and brown sugar because I was almost out of brown sugar and I used more peanut butter. I still found it lacking in the flavor department so I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I also followed someone elses tip and lowered the baking temp to 350 and went about eleven minutes.",

                "reviewBody": "More like 3 1/2 stars as I had to make a decent amount of adjustments. For one this recipe used far too little peanut butter! I used the called for amount and tasted the batter and barely tasted the PB. I ended up having to add 2 cups worth for a real peanuty flavor. I added 1/4 cup cane sugar and 1 cup brown. I use energy egg re-placer instead of egg as I never see it necessary to make s baked good dairy if it doesn't need to be. I skipped the butter as it's unnecessary since the peanut oil subs for the purpose of the butter and I used about 1 cup of water. I added peanut butter chips too. Didn't bother cooling the batter as it was clear it was the perfect consistency so don't waste your time fridging overnight! Who wants to wait for that?! As always I baked one cookie to make sure it was the right texture. These need to be formed (what I call holding hand cookies) as you cannot just roll the batter into a ball and place on the sheet & expect them to mold themselves in the shape of a cookie. You must roll the batter in a pretty large golf ball sized ball and then flatten. About 5 min into the baking process I make fork indents in the centers. I also made some w/ chocolate chips. Came out moist (help of the water) semi0chewy and not dry at all. Will make again based on my adjustments.",

I rolled them out into bigger balls refrained from flattening them then pressed a Hershey's kiss into the middle of each one as soon as they came out of the oven. I sent some to work with my husband and all the guys requested that I send in more. The dough keeps well in the fridge for a few days so all you have to do is pull it out and bake it for fresh cookies. Much better than the crunchy cookie recipes I've run across.",
