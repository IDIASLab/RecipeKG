Whatever the reason we both enjoyed this a lot. No changes other than to add a little minced garlic to the sauteed vegetables and it was fine as is. Sometimes simple flavors are nice in their own right without a lot of additional herbs and spices.",

As another reviewer noted, had MORE than enough filling, but I just heaped 'er in!!:)  This was a fantastic recipe!!!",
