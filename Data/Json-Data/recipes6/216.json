I have to tell you that I did not use all the ginger or all the chile paste it called for---maybe only half of each---and even then I thought it was going to be so spicy that I couldn't serve it!  And I even added a little bit more water to the pan before it was reduced.  But I was so wrong!  I kept going back to put a little bit more on my fish.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Costco just got in their Wild Fresh Copper River Salmon at a paltry $9.99 per pound!  I grilled up a little less than a pound for the two of us, and we ate it all.  I went easy on the sauce for my hubby, but I added a whole bunch more for myself--kept going back for more.  I just may have to go get more salmon because I'm not done eating this stuff!  EDIT: I sauteed pounded down boneless skinless breasts in olive oil with a little butter and made this sauce for it.  At the very end of the sauce, I put in about a teaspoon of butter to swirl around.  We literally licked our plates!  So very very yummy!  Talk about an easy meal to fix!",

I was concerned it would be too hot with the chilli paste but the rice vinegar tones it down considerablly so next time I'll use the correct amount.
