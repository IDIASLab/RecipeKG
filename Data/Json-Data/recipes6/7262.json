The cooking time must have been off because it was not very well done and when I tried to make it brown up better it just didn't work for me. I did use the optional vanilla but it could have used a little baking powder and maybe some cinnamon. I really do appreciate the idea and this would appeal to many people so don't just go by MY review!:)",

By themselves they taste like what I call very ripe banana nastiness.  I tried putting some fruit on top, but that did not help.  Cooking them with the butter gave me that nice golden pancake look.  They were much softer than normal pancakes, but that is to be expected with the batter's high water content from the bananas.  Maybe I will try this again with less ripe bananas.  I typically like to eat my bananas with a little green on them, so that likely explains why the taste is so bad for me.  I know it is hard to tell with reviews how people like to eat bananas.",
