It tastes a lot like carrot cake but different enough that you can tell it is _not_ carrot cake - prompting enquiries of \"What the heck is in here?\" No one ever guesses potatoes! This takes about 2 or 1.5 regular sweet potatoes. The batter is wonderful and will make a cake with two layers nicely. Mine did sag a bit in the middle after cooling but were still great. I frosted with Caramel Frosting which I just realised now I forgot to add the vanilla to. A chewy moist cake that keeps well.",
