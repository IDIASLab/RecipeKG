                "reviewBody": "If you're hankering for choco donut and will try this recipe despite bad reviews, here's how I was able to get this recipe to work:  After chilling dough 30 min, \"dough\" resembled \"batter\", so I put a medium amount of flour on the counter.  Then, I used rubber scraper to scoop half batter out.  Then I sprinkled flour on top of batter and used fingers to lightly press dough out.  I floured biscuit cutter, cut shape, and scooted shape away from batter while still in cutter.  Then, I used a liter bottle cap to create hole.  I used a floured, heat-resistant spatula to slide under donut shape and slide into heated oil.  After frying first batch, I decided donut resembled deep-fat fried, light and fluffy, chocolate cake.  The flavor was supreme, but I wanted something easier to work with and denser.  For the second batch, I  used remainder of first half of batter.  I worked about 1/8 c. flour into batter and used a smaller biscuit cutter, which helped make dough manageable and kept donut shape better.  \n\nThese changes brought this donut closer to fulfilling my expectations.  I think with second half of batter, I will try to mix in 1/4 c. of flour before turning it out onto floured surface, aiming for dough similar to gingerbread cookie dough, and fry it at a temp higher than 375.  These donuts absorbed more grease than I like, but flavor was still good.  We ate them without icing.",
