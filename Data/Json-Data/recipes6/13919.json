I made it today and used this recipe and tweaked it with things that I remember my mother doing. I used mayonnaise Miracle Whip is sweet so the amount of sugar recommended worked well for me. Also my mother didn't use flour her thickening was the eggs so I used 3 eggs instead of 2. I didn't use water I used condensed milk that makes it a little richer. Also I used apple cider vinegar and just a splash of sweet pickle brine. Mine turned out perfect it's a nice light yellow and has a creamy pudding like consistency. It may not be as good as my mother's (no one cooked like her) but it's pretty darn good.",
