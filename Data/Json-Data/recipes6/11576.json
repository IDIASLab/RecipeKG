I skipped the oranges and the pasta instead of adding the Tbls of sugar I added 2 Tbls of the pineapple juice. I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of miracle whip added a few green onions cut down the celery to 2 stalks and grilled four chicken breasts. I served the chicken salad in warm soft pitas. I know I changed mine alot but this recipe gave me the foundation for what I was looking for.",
