I used 2/3 c of coconut milk, about 1 c water, 1 c rolled oats, and 5 generous dashes of cinnamon. I brought the coconut milk and water to a gentle boil (barely looked like boiling) with the lid on the pot - took about 20 minutes. After mixing the oatmeal in, I let it sit for 15 minutes without the lid, then stirred in cinnamon and immediately removed the pot from the stove. The oatmeal was rich and creamy, with a perfect amount of coconut and cinnamon flavor. 10/10 would make again",
