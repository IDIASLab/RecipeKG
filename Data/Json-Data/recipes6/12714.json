Be careful not to add to much flour, then I rolled them out and used my Christmas cookie cutters. I let them cool and lightly dusted them with powdered sugar. Look how cute they are, and they taste really good, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Next time though I will try butter instead of shortening, I think it will have a little more flavor. I hope you try them too!",
