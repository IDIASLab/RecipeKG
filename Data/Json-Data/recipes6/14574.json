After 2 days baking, of all the cookies I made, (all 5 star recipes from here) I think this one was my personal favorite, and oatmeal is not my favorite cookies. It really did have a nice blend of sweet and savory, with a great texture.  Now that I think about it, they all were delicious.  Check your cook times, If you like a toasted crunchy flavor, bake a bit longer if you like a chewy cookie, bake a bit less and let cool on the pan. These ARE NOT \"CAKEY Cookies\"  Listen Reviewers.. if 100 people review something and say its a chewy cookie, and 5 say its a Cakey Cookie, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, the 5 did something wrong or different.  So before I judge a cookie against the grain, I'm going to make doggone sure I'm not the one looking like an idiot. Which means DOUBLE checking my recipe. Did I put too much of one thing and not enough of another? Is my oven too hot or not hot enough? Do I need to adjust my cook times? Am I cooling this on the cookie sheets? Are my cookies more like plum sized rather than walnut sized?  I'm amazed by how many people can rate a cookie as awesome and then One reviewer comes in and bashes it and says something totally contrary to what everything else is saying, I know tastes are subjective, but texture? Not quite as much.   Bottom line, before you bash a DELICIOUS recipe. Take a second, perhaps the problem is not the recipe, but the cook.",

To tell you the truth, I was initially unimpressed with and concerned about the dough as it seemed dry and it was kind of difficult to incorporate the oatmeal thoroughly.  However... these are probably one of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tried.  First of all, they bake up beautifully, and you'd be proud to put them on your serving plate.  I mean, they have a bakery look about them.  Secondly, and most important, they're just darn good!  Crispy on the edges, soft and chewy on the inside, pleasantly sweet with just a hint of cinnamon.

Some notes for those who like to experiment: I have made them with or without the nuts; they are excellent either way. Try dried cranberries for all or part of the raisins -- that gives it a nice tart sweetness too. I have even made them with chocolate chips (skipping the \"soaking\" step) and that is top notch as well if you have a big chocolate fan in your house. The review below that suggests more raisins and more cinnamon might be on to something. But then I always think you can't have enough raisins and spice. Excellent recipe!",
