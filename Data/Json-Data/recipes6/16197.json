                "reviewBody": "This cake should have 10 stars!!!  I made it for my husband's birthday last night.  I used a bundt pan (dusting with cocoa powder in lieu of flour) which required about an 20 minutes extra baking time.  I then let the cake cool for a few minutes in the pan, and then took it out of the pan to finish cooling while I made the frosting.  After the frosting was done, I put the cake back into the bundt pan and then poked holes in the bottom of the cake with a wooden spoon and a fork.  I then poured about half the frosting into the holes.  I would have let it sit like that for awhile but my husband was coming home so almost immediately I put the cake on the serving plate and then using a basting brush, painted the rest of the frosting onto the top of the cake.  Gobs of frosting still pooled into the \"hole\" of the bundt cake.  When my husband took the first bite, he exclaimed - \"Oh My God!  It's filled with chocolate!\"  I ***strongly*** recommend using the highest quality of cocoa powder available as it is the only chocolate in the cake.  I used Ghiradelli.  Also, the batter was quite runny when I poured it into the pan but it cooked up just fine.  I also \"made\" my own buttermilk by adding 1 T. apple cider vinegar to 1 c. milk and letting it set for a few minutes.  I also used 1/4 c. cocoa powder in the cake as opposed to just 3 T..  Amazing recipe!",

I would caution, however, that you do not beat it for the full 3 minutes if you intend to pour it over your cake (I like it poured over bundt cake).  It will not flow down the sides but rather sit on the top in more of a clump.  Stop beating when it looks a little thinner than what you want because it will set very fast.",

I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead of the 3T and an extra tsp of vanilla.  Also I didn't have buttermilk so I added a tsp of vinegar to a cup of regular milk.  The icing was very yummy even though I burnt it while boiling.  I saved it by just pouring off the good stuff and not scaping the bottom of the pot.  Also I only beat it for 2 min and didn't have any problems with it being too thick.  SUPER DUPER and very moist!",

Just a couple of suggestions:\nI use a little over 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, instead of 3 tbls.\nDo not burn your frosting.\nProperly butter and flour your pan beforehand (I use a 9X13 pan).\nDo NOT overbake. Take out while still slightly moist on the toothpick (not clean like the recipe says). I shut off oven and let the cake sit in for 5 min max after the slighly moist point.\n\nand ENJOY!!!",

Perhaps people have never had a really good piece of chocolate cake before. I'll give it 2 stars because it didn't taste \"bad\" but I think there are things wrong with the recipes for both the cake and the frosting. The cake definitely needed more cocoa powder. Also the texture was strange when it had finished baking. Part of the problem may lie with the method in which it is mixed and it that it is a fairly runny batter. By itself I didn't care for the cake at all. The fudge topping has a good flavor but unless you like to crunch on granules of sugar it should be cooked differently. The sugar needs a chance to dissolve. Fudge should be smooth not crystallized. I think the problem may be that it needs more liquid perhaps some corn syrup. I am going to look for another chocolate cake recipe. In all seriousness the ones out of the box are better. Sorry but this one is definitely not worth the time.",
