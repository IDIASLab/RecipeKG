All three kids (10, 4, and 2) ate in perfect silence.... It was quite nice! I hope it does the same for your family.",

I didn't have coconut so I added 2 diced apples in the morning I omitted the chocolate chips and added 1 tsp cinnamon. Mine baked in 30 minutes the milk was totally absorbed softer in middle and firmer at edge. I still felt it was missing something maybe next time use maple syrup for brown sugar or maple extract for the vanilla. I made this recipe for the Allrecipe Allstars Canada March challenge #10aday",
