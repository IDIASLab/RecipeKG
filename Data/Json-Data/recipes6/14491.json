I have made this recipe about 20 times, so I thought I would share my tips.\n\n1) I use dry ginger, but otherwise follow the recipe to the letter. \n\n2) Don't add all the flour mixture at once.  Sometimes it doesn't need it all and the dough will be too dry. \n\n3) The dough, when completed, should be uniform in colour and texture.  You should be able to pick it up with your hands and form it into a large ball without any cracks.  It should also not stick to your fingers.\n\n4) Chilling the dough is paramount.  If the dough is not chilled enough, then the cookies will be too flat, won't form a crispy crust, and won't have the awesome cracks on the top.\n\n5) I use a 1/8 cup measuring thingy to make all my dough balls exactly the same size (crazy?).  They cook for exactly 15 minutes at 350 in my oven.  The middle of each cookie will be raised, but will fall when it cools.\n\n6)I prefer them a couple days old, but my G/F likes then best right from the oven.\n\nI want to add some more detail on the look of the cookie.  Using a 1/8 cup ball, and cooking for 15 minutes, I get a cookie that is just over 1cm thick.  Every cookie has deep cracks (deeper than the picture).  I sprinkle sugar on them when they come out of the oven too.\n\nIf you cookie is too flat and lacks cracks, your dough was either too wet, or you didn't chill the dough enough. \n\nIf the cookie has a rounded, puffy top, and the cookie tastes dry, then the dough had too much flour added to it.\n\nGood luck!",
