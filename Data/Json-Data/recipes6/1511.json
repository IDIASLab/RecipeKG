My husband was leary at first about cooking all the ingredients together so I baked the fish on a parchment lined sheet along side the vegies. When I served it I put a layer of brown rice on the plate and the fish and vegies on top of that. My husband and I were both in agreement that the recipe is a keeper. Next time I will use a little less onion and tomato and maybe cut the onion into smaller sections because some of the onion was not sufficiently tender. I'm glad I have found a recipe that doesn't drown the fish in some canned cream soup!",
