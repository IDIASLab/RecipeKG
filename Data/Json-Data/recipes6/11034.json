                "reviewBody": "There is just no way one could say they made this recipe \"exactly\" and have it turn out. (Assuming you're using the Bundt cake pan called for in the recipe) Any cake mix bundt recipe needs to bake between 50-60 minutes, not 25 minutes as written. This discrepancy makes this recipe fatally flawed right from the start, in my opinion. Experienced cooks will know better, but if a beginner cook baked this and thought it would be done in 25 minutes, they'd wonder what they did wrong. Having said that, the orange flavor was nice, particularly since I added a teaspoon of orange extract to the batter (would have used 1 T. of grated oranze zest if I had it), and used orange juice in the batter as well, rather than the water called for. As for the syrup, in hindsight I'd use only half this recipe. Yes, this definitely is a moist cake, but it really is TOO moist - soggy, in fact, in places where the cake absorbed the syrup more than others. I cannot recommend this recipe as written. However, if you adjust the baking time to 50-60 minutes (mine took 55) and make the changes I made to use orange juice instead of water, add a teaspoon of orange extract or a tablespoon of grated orange zest and reduce the syrup by half this would be a four star, cake mix cake.

I made edits to this recipe.\n1 Box of Duncan Hines Orange Supreme Cake Mix (instead of the yellow mix)\n\n1 Box of Orange Jello mix along with 1 Box of the Vanilla Pudding mix\n\nOrange Zest added to cake mix.\n\nI also add the orange zest to the glaze. When still hot in the pan, I poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze over the cake. Let it sit for 15 minutes to absorb all of the mixture before flipping the cake.  All the juice should be absorbed into the cake before flipped.\n\nI love this cake and will plan on making it again. It WAS TRULY A HIT!",

It's very moist and bursting with orange flavor - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! I do agree however that the directions need a little revising and the ingredients need a little \"tweaking\" to heighten the orange flavor thus the 4 stars vs. 5. But, I wouldn't down grade the recipe completely. To heighten the orange flavor I used 3/4 cup of orange juice vs. 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of orange extract along with a Tbsp of orange zest. And, I did bake it at 325 for 55 minutes. Other than that, this makes for a delicious dessert! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did. It baked up perfectly and even though the recipe for the glaze could probably be cut in half it really does add to the cake. Once it was cooled, I couldn't resist drizzling some melted white chocolate over it for a bit of contrast and to take it over the top. Great recipe!",
