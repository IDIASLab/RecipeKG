I always cut the amount of sugar in cakes, and cut this to 1 cup sugar only and it was fine (unless you have a very sweet tooth).  I made it first with too much applesauce (to finish the jar I had), and it came out way too dense although my children loved it.  When I made it a second time with the right amount of applesauce, the consistency was pefect.  I also sprinkled the top with a sugar and cinnamon mixture before it baked and it made the cake look nice without any frosting.",
