I used 1.5 times the \"topping\" and put it in the middle, and added a little cardamom and nutmeg as well as extra cinnamon. It is important to grease your bundt well and flour it too; I did this and still had a small area where the filling stuck to the wall of the pan. Baked for about 50 minutes at 325 degrees convection. Dusted with 10x as suggested. Very moist; keeps well in a cake dome overnight (if yours lasts long enough) and goes well with coffee drinks. I do recommend lightly toasting your pecans or walnuts before chopping. It heightens the flavors a bit in the finished cake. This is one of the best coffee cakes I have ever baked and I have tried quite a few recipes over the last 10 years or so! Highly recommended.",

I doubled the topping recipe and have made it in a 9x9 pan,a loaf pan (more bread like) and also in a bundt pan (preferred method and cook for 1hr) for a more cake like presentation. For the pan version, I put topping on top. For the bundt version, I put the topping in the middle of the batter and it comes out looking amazing. People ask how I got it in there. (just put 1/2 of batter in, topping, then 1/2 of batter again). I've also made it with walnuts instead of pecans. I think pecans taste better but they're both great.",

The bundt pan works best, but use generous amounts of shortening and lightly flour before putting batter into pan.  After cooling in pan overnight, the cake literally fell out the next morning.  Don't overdo the topping in the center of the bundt pan.  The first time I did that and the cake separated when I tried to get it out of the pan.  Using real vanilla extract instead of imitation gave it a better flavor.  I also used slivered almonds, but didn't have almond extract to add to the batter.  It was still delicious, but want to try it with almond extract next time.  Using the 9 x 13 pan didn't work too well.  The topping sunk a bit into the cake, so I served it out of the pan \"as is\".  It didn't seem as moist as when cooked as a bundt cake, either.  Definitely a keeper!",

I did make some minor ingredient changes -I only had walnuts so I used those instead of pecans; I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2; I made 1 1/2 times the amount of strusel; and I added about 1 teaspoon of almond extract as well as the vanilla (1 tablespoon). I baked it in a bundt pan and I put some of the strusel topping in first, then half the batter, the rest of the stresel, and the remainder of the batter. I baked it for 35 minutes (my oven is a little slow), but it tested clean. The one thing in the directions that I think was most important is that you FOLD the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. By doing this carefully, you get a very nice texture to the coffeecake.",

                "reviewBody": "Could this be anything but perfect? An important step while preparing the batter is to hand incorporate the flour mixture. It does not come out as well when cheating and using the mixer for that step.  I noticed some reviews rating it down a bit due to sinking of the topping. My first time making this I ended up with a solid brick of the topping toward the bottom of the cake. Still ate it...but not what it should have been. For anyone having a problem with sinking topping, here's how you fix it. Add 2T flour to the topping mix and incorporate all. It is easy to mix the butter in while melted or using the Cuisinart, but don't! Use your fingers to rub solid, cold butter into the dry topping ingredients. You will not see the \"butter balls\" and it will look like loose damp brown sugar. Use this method for all of your baking and you will notice the difference in all of your toppings. Then I add the pecans and top the batter. The other real problem is cook time. In a 350* oven, you must bake for 1 hour. Any less than that and you have a beautiful edge, but soup inside. Don't do the tooth pick test until it has baked 55 minutes or the middle will sink. At 30-35 minutes it isn't half baked. So plan for the hour, and it does not burn. It comes out the most perfect golden brown you have ever seen. Lastly, this is the only coffee cake that will still be moist 3 days later!",
