I cut up the sausage and threw it in the skillet with the garlic. Then added leftover grilled veggies tomatoes (I used Italian style drained) and added the chard at the end just 5 min until it wilted. Note: you can chop up the chard stems and add that with the veggies. Delicious!",

I agreed with the other users on cutting back on the chili flakes (and this is coming from a spicy aficionado). Also I agree that adding of the pasta water was unnecessary and made it a little bit watery than desired. I added in sliced onions with the sausage and garlic and substituted the rabe for spinach. I also took the sausage out its casing so it would cook faster and more thoroughly. Will make again definitely way easy!",
