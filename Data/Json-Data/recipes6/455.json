I made them as written except I sliced my apples a little bit too thin. They shrunk while baking and were paper-thin. I should have followed the 1/4 inch suggestion however I was afraid they wouldn't cook through. The thin apples made the bars harder to cut because the apples had a tendency to slide off the bars. I also found it less messy to cut the bars first then spread the caramel on each one. These aren't too sweet just how I like my dessert. I sprinkled these with some coarse sea salt to kick them up a notch. Very impressive dessert!",

I used 3 apples instead of 2 and instead of the caramel dip I made my own caramel sauce using kraft caramels and evaporated milk (it's what i had on hand). I did not mix any into the cream cheese but just placed it on top of the apples after baking. The crust is rather large compared to the amount of cheesecake so I would definitely double the cheesecake part next time.",
