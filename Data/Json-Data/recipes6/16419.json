The others were too dense (almost spongey) and way too cinnamon-y for my tastes. Although I did add about a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and allspice to this recipe give it a hint of flavor... it was just right not overpowering at all. The second time I made it I added a 1/2 cup of chopped apples... Delicious! I also drain my zucchini... I don't squeeze it out I just let it drain in a colander while I prepare the recipe. It still comes out super moist and delicious!",
