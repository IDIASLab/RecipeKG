Also the description of how much liquid to add is vague. Because of the comments I read about how bland it was we used cream of chicken soup instead of just stock. Not sure if this made it better or not but added a little density and the rice was quite tasty. We added -- Some sun dried tomatoes (I actually like rice and tomatoes together) which gave some tang a lot more garlic some paprika and some other veggies (we had some green onion and cauliflower around). Finally we topped everything off with some cheese the last 10 or so minutes (we had a light Gouda which added creaminess but not a conflicting flavor). Next time I would either cook the potatoes a little bit or slice them quite thin to make sure they cooked. 1/8\" or thinner. This rating is largely based on the recipe as written but I agree with others who said this is a nice start but needs some big adjustments to make work.",
