I cooked the garlic, peppers and onions in oil first then placed in the baking dish.  Then I salted and peppered the flour. Dredging the steaks in that.  I browned both sides of the steaks in vegtable oil, removing them when browned.  Then I deglazed the pan with 1 14.5oz can of beef broth, letting it reduce also.  I then placed the steaks in the bottom of the baking dish and placed the pepper mixture on top, then poured the broth drippings over that and baked.  WONDERFUL....feeds a family of 5 for under $8.00. Add a slice of provolone to the top also for a variation.  THANKS!",

It is a great way to make cube steaks! I served it with mashed potatos and a side dish of yellow squash. I might try a pressure cooker next time to get it done quicker.",

I added the peppers at the last just to warm them. Last I sprinkled shredded swiss cheese to the top. I served over some left over rice. I will fix this again for a quick dinner Update. I am no longer eating meat. I made this with Portabellasin stead of the meat and used vegtable broth. Yum.",

However I was in a hurry to cook something good...fast so I cooked in a hurry and realized only after I had everything going in the stove that I didn't quite follow the cooking method lol. Good thing this wasn't a complicated dish as I have made pepper steak many times over the years but was looking for a new way. I found this recipe and read it went right into the kitchen and began cooking it my old way (I am still trying to figure out that move but anywho)in a wok I added about a 1tbs. of oil and stir-fried green peppers onions sliced garlic and canned mushrooms. Eyeballed a couple of shakes of soy sauce that sizzled into the pan. Then added the floured cubed beef and the water and then poured into a 13X something pyrex pan that I lined with foil (for easy cleanup) and placed in the oven covered until meat was tender. I served over basmati rice with a tossed garden salad. I had no need to add salt to this as I was serving extra soy souce on the side as a condiment. It was very tastey and have added it to my next months dinners next time I will try cooking it exactly as the recipe states. Thanks again",
