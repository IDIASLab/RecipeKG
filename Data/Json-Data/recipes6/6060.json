I did put salt.  it's a good base of nutritious ingredients that you can flavor to your liking.  I will try it again incorporating the suggestions of other reviewers. I did improve the flavor of the rice by putting 2 32 ounce boxes of chicken broth in the soup.  then after the soup was complete dipped 2 cups of soup broth out and cooked the rice in that.  that was worthwhile.",
