                "reviewBody": "My understanding is that these \"bars,\" which really are candy, have been a sentimental favorite since the company began making them in 1918! Cherry Mash even has it's own web site, on which you can either order the necessary cherry baking chips, or they guide you to massive web sites (think Amazon) where they also may be purchased if difficult to find in your area.   In other words, if you REALLY need to make these but can't find the chips, it CAN be done! This recipe is on the package of chips on which they direct you to mix the nuts in with the chocolate/peanut butter mixture. They also suggest refrigerating this for faster setting, which indeed worked nicely. I guess I can see why some people think of these fondly, particularly if they grew up with them and have memories of their childhood. Maybe they're an acquired taste because as  a Cherry Mash newbie I found them ungodly sweet and artificial tasting.  Maybe that's their appeal!  The chocolate/peanut butter/nut layer, however, is a perfect contrast, and if you don't like the cherry part it's good on it's own.  I will say that I can't imagine making these without the nuts - the salty crunch and contrast in texture is a must for this candy and even using chunky peanut butter would not be a similar substitute.  In the final analysis, I'm sure Cherry Mash Bar lovers would rate these five stars, as I'm sure they must be close to the real thing, but without the nostalgia these are not much more than a sugar rush for me.",
