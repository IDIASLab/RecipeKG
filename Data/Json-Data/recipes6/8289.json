                "reviewBody": "With some help, this is a winner.  A pound of processed cheese is enough to overwhelm any meal, and the canned chunk chicken is not so good either.  Here's how we make it:  Bake 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and shred.  Make rice in our rice cooker just like always, then scoop 2/3 of the cooked rice into the 9 X 13 pan with the chicken.  (Our rice cooker calls for 3 cups uncooked to be used so we save the rest of the rice to make rice pudding so nothing goes to waste.  It's also cheaper than instant rice)  Then I take 16 oz of whatever cheese I have in the house and shred it.  1/2 Jack and 1/2 cheddar work great.  Add a packet of onion soup mix INSTEAD of chopping onions, then 2 cans of whatever condensed creamy soups you like (we use 1 chicken and 1 brocoli), a cup of milk, the butter, and a bag of frozen brocoli.  Then we top with sliced provolone cheese which we always have in the house anyway, and bake as per instructions.  Between the soups, cheeses, and dry soup mix, no additional salt or pepper is necessary.",

To make it even faster and easier, I used a rotisserie chicken from my grocery store and just pulled that off the bone, did not pre-cook the rice (instead put it in the casserole dry and added one can of low-sodium chicken broth to the mix), and used 1 package of shredded velveeta and 1 package of shredded sharp cheddar.  A few grinds of the pepper mill, a loaf of garlic bread and a tossed salad...dinner was complete.  Great meal for a busy mom.  Thanks for sharing.",

When chicken was cooked, i cut it up and dumped the whole frying pan, onions, garlic and all, into the casserole dish. Used 1 cup grated cheddar cheese, 1 can cream of Chicken, and 1 can Cream of Broccoli and Cheese *which is why I used less grated*.  Half cup milk, half cup sour cream, lots of pepper, a bit of salt, a few shots of hot sauce (we love it) 3 cups rice and 4 cups steamed fresh broccoli.  Cooked for 30 mins on 350, pulled out and crumbled Ritz crackers over top (the cheddar ones) And cooked for another 10 mins.  FABULOUS! Thank you!!",
