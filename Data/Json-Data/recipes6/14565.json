It was the first time I had ever seen anyone fry raw rice! The aroma while the rice is cooking is fabulous - almost unbearable! She served it with okra that was stewed with tomatoes and we ate by scooping it up with warm pita bread using only our left hands. It was my first hands - on experience of authentic ethnic cooking and I have since gotten 'the bug' and continue similar types of cooking adventures. I will always think of my friend when I prepare this rice - thank you Uzma!",
