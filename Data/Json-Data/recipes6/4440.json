Try adding cherry tomatoes- several colors, fresh basil, fresh oregano, red onions, instead of boring yellow ones, and some bell pepper or roasted red peppers. Now you can serve it over rice or noodles with fresh French bread and have a whole meal. It really doesn't need all that broth just a couple of tablespoons. You don't want to make soup.",

I added some diced tomatoes (from a can but fresh would be better) and added fresh oregano and basil at the end rather than parsley since I haven't grown that yet. The butter flavor was a nice touch; I wonder if it would taste better if the veggies were sauteed in butter rather than olive oil at the beginning? Also if I had had white wine on hand I would have used that instead of veggie broth. Anyway good recipe for summer veggies thanks!",

The recipe is not meant to \"stand alone\" though it surely could for a vegetarian but is a perfect side dish to pair with spicy ribs or chicken for a family friendly BBQ. Nice meld of flavors and easy enough to dress up with basil oregano or cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden. NOTE: I bbq'd my corn on the cob and then added to the squash right before serving. The smokiness of the corn from the bbq added another layer of flavor to this dish. Enjoy!",

I omitted the onions (I'm allergic) and added cherry tomatos instead. The tomatos really did add some color and texture to the appearance of the meal as did the fresh parsley. Great recipe!
