I finally bough the original ritz crackers, and said what the heck, I'll just make it and see! I was afraid it was going to be too salty or something. \nLet me tell you, it came out awesome!! I cannot believe how much it tastes like apple pie, but better! My mom tasted it not knowing it didn't have apples, and said,\" this is a great pie, especially cuz the apples have caramelized, and THAT's how I like them to taste!\" The topping was also really good, crispy and chewy at the same time. It was perfect warm or even after it cooled down completely. If I cut down on the sugar next time however, I think it would be even more delicious! Great recipe if you need to make really good apple pie and you don't have apples, but should't be made too often, just because it is not as healthy!",

Tasted a bit and gave the two pies away as a Valentine's Gift. Added a bit of lemon juice and added more cinnamon during the boiling process. We didn't have enough Ritz crackers for the topping so we used cheddar and peanut butter sandwich crackers. This made it even better! It gave it a saltier tangier kick that only that sandwich cracker can do. It reminded me of a salt water taffy type candy. Yummy. I would definitely make it again.",

It was a great experiment but really nothing more. After being in the refrigerator overnight the filling thickened up to look even more like apple pie. It tastes like a decent pie but I think the topping was a little too salty with the additional Ritz crackers. I would recommend making another streussel topping or adding a top crust instead. After the first piece of \"apple pie \" I could not eat anymore because the thought of cracker pie was somewhat sickening. It is a great joke to play however and it may be a great gift to give unexpecting relatives.",

                "reviewBody": "I have to give this recipe 5 stars for pure genius! I made it as a experiment and I can't imagine making it again because truly why would you want to take the apples out but it was so much fun when people kept wandering in after I had made it smelling the apple pie and then having them comment on how great it was and then watching their shcoked expressions after revealing the truth. Priceless! Probably the most fun I've EVER had cooking something and I always have a lot of fun cooking. Tips: Make sure the crumbs on top are really crushed or just go ahead and use another pie crust. If anything were to give the pie away it would be big pieces of crackers on top. Additionally 35 minutes was a little too much in my oven so make sure you check while it cooks. Cornstarch would be great(about a TB or so) to thinken it up because it totally fell apart when we cut it. The only one who thought the pie was fishy was my mom( a highly critical foodie) who thought that I had made the pie with applesauce. That's the only fault of the pie; it lacks the chunkiness that real apple pie has and that why I'll stick with the real apples. Plus Ritz crackers aren't really the best for you. But still a fun experiment!",

By the way as another reviewer noted DON'T stir the crackers after putting them in the syrup. Just plop them in and leave them be for 5 minutes.",
