It's quite tasty and the maple cream layer cuts the sweetness of the apple and streusel layers well. I think my only complaint is that the maple cream layer seems a little soft...I wonder what would happen if I left the extra 1/2 cup of milk out of it. I couldn't cut and serve a piece...it was more like dishing out banana pudding or something of similar consistency. I also left the apples in the skillet (didn't really end up with extra syrup because of this) and the streusel on the pan to cool so I didn't have to use extra dishes. Overall though quite tasty and a great alternative to apple pie!",
