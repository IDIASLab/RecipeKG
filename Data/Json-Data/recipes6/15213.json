I just HAD to try it out! I didn't hate this but I certainly have had better. For one I couldn't detect the chocolate - at ALL!. I was really hoping for a chocolate-covered strawberry flavor but all I could taste was banana. Perhaps my banana was too large (in my defense this recipe doesn't specify whether it should be large medium or small...)??? I DO like the creaminess the banana and yogurt gave this tho. And after adding another good squirt more of chocolate syrup (swirled into my smoothie) I got more of the effect I was looking for. If you are wanting the chocolate flavor to come thru I think you could substitute chocolate yogurt for plain (I used vanilla as it's all I had on hand). From now on I'm going to stick with strawberry oatmeal breakfast smoothie (ASTROPHE). It fills me up more and is much healthier to boot (it contains oatmeal for nutrition / filler genius IMHO). I'd rather not waste calories on chocolate that I can't even taste anyways! NOTE: If you freeze your fruit (unpeel your bananas!!!) your smoothie will be extra thick and very cold!
