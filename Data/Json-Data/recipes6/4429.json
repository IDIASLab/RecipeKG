The only change I had to make was chicken broth rather than vegetable broth. I have tried this with vegetable broth the chicken broth definitely gives it better flavor. I also would recommend using two garlic cloves. You could easily add more of the vegetables as they cook down quite a bit or just halve the amount of noodles used. I would definitely make this again.",

I sauteed them with the garlic and oil and let them cook along with the vegetables. It was a nice compliment to the dish. My husband really liked it and I will be making this one again!",

I cooked the broth and vegetables in a large skillet and the broth cooked way down while the veggies were cooking so mine was not soupy at all. It had just enough broth to keep the pasta moist after I mixed the pasta into the dish at the end. I added enough red pepper flakes to make it mellow and not hot. I too felt it needed more seasoning beyond salt and pepper but I didn't want to go the southwestern flavor route. I waited until the whole wheat pasta was cooked then tried a taste test with a spoonful seasoned with basil. Next a spoonful with oregano. I ended up adding dried basil and dried oregano to taste (a generous half-teaspoon each) and it tasted very good with the cheese sprinkled on. This is a very good week night dish. I liked it and my husband did also but commented that he would like maybe some Italian sausage on the side! I will make this again.",
