I used a slotted spoon to remove the berries from the pot into the bowl and then saved the reserved juice to pour over top of the pudding before adding a tablespoon of fresh whipped cream.",

                "reviewBody": "I used buttercrust homestyle white bread from the bakery (the best white bread ever IMO) and refrigerated the pudding overnight weighted down with two cans of veggies. I trimmed the crust off of the bread for appearance sake so I added an extra slice of bread to compensate for that. There was a lot of raspberry juice puddling on the top and the pudding did not release from the bowl when inverted. I'm not sure how this pudding should be presented but I was hopeful that I'd be able to slice it. However the only option I had was to spoon it into a dessert dish. I think the excessive juice affected the appearance of the dessert and I will reduce the sugar to 1 cup next time to see if that helps. Perhaps just draining off a little of the juice before pouring it into the bread shell might help as well. Unusual recipe with an incredibly intense and sweet fresh raspberry flavor. In spite of not being able to unmold it it was fabulous (and easy too)!",
