I like to use a package and a half of the pre-shredded coleslaw mix it gives you the same results but less time is spent on chopping. In addition to make this one \"different \" from the other recipe I used cashews in place of blanched almonds...I just tossed them in when I mixed in the sauce. I'm keeping this one just in case I ever lose my copy of the receipe for Asian Salad.",

I could have eaten the whole bowl! I made my mom fix it for me several times while home visiting - and it was also the big hit with any guests who lucked out and were present for dinner with this fabulous salad on the side. It does take a bit of work - but it's worth it! Plan to eat the whole salad in one sitting as it's not so great the next day when the crunchies have gone stale. If it's too much for one sitting make the salad and split it into two before adding the top ramen and almonds. Put the extra toppings in an airtight container for the next day. Do the same with half the dressing. Trust me - this is as good as the chinese salads you get in a restaurant! Kudos to the chef who shared this with the rest of us!!!",
