Don\u2019t assemble when you have mail on your counter!  \n\nMay use less sugar and add pureed Rhubarb to the syrup next time for extra flavor.  But it doesn\u2019t need it.

I finally dumped everything willy nilly in the 13x9 pan and then poured the syrup over and it came out with a nice crust but all gooey and sticky and yucky at the bottom. It looked awful.
