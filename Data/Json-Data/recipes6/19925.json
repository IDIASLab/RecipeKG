Anyway, I used 2-3 Tablespoons of cornstarch, not teaspoons.  1/4 c. sugar, because the choc. chips are so sweet.  I added 3 heaping tablespoons of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, Dutch process.  Oh, my, what a great ingredient!  You have to cook the milk concoction til it boils, which means you have to use some heat to get it to thicken, which it does no problem if you use enough cornstarch and enough heat.  My family loves this recipe and I think next time I'll try adding 1/4 peanut butter or a few peppermint sticks for a change.  Excellent ice cream.",

I added a shot (1oz) of bourbon which smoothed things out and added a yummy flavor. The second time I used plain yogurt and aspartame packets instead of sugar (18 packets = 3/4 c sugar) and it was still delicious. A really good rich low fat recipe. It benefits from the addition of a spoonful of cocoa powder to enhance the chocolate flavor.",

Per other reviews I used a tablespoon of corn starch and added a tablespoon of unsweetened dutched cocoa powder. I combined these with 1/2 cup sugar in a saucepan with the evaporated milk and brought it to a boil stirring regularly. After boiling for a couple of minutes it thickened up nicely. Then I reduced the heat to low and added the chocolate chips. I made sure to use good-quality chocolate (Green Black brand cocoa and Ghirardelli chocolate chips). I also used vanilla low-fat yogurt and omitted the vanilla since that's what I had on hand. The end result was creamy thick and chocolatey. It was great right out of the ice cream maker (soft serve consistency) and frozen overnight (hard pack consistency). Thanks for the recipe!",
