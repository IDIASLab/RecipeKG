Since I did that I had to bake about an hour and a half but to me it was worth it since I didn't have to go through all that prep. This made a TON of potatoes and we enjoyed them which is really good since it is just the two of us. I used olive oil for the roux instead and made a bit more of the sauce. I also salted and peppered the potato layers since I didn't cube but sliced. Thanks for the recipe!",

First I used Walnut Milk instead of soy milk and Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular. Then I cut back on the plant based cheese because it is usually off putting to me when used as exact equivalents to cow cheese. So I replaced the soy cheese with 1/2 cup Daiya Cheddar 1/4 cup cashew based mozzarella and 1/4 cup nutritional yeast. The darker color of the walnut milk looked more like cream of mushroom soup. But the taste was phenomenal! I will definitely make it again!",
