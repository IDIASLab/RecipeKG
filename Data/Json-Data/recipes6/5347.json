It is perfectly spicy with an amazing aroma and a touch of sweetness from the sweet potatoes. Serve over Indian basmati rice and enjoy the exotic flavors. We use unsalted pumpkin seeds or unsalted cashews for a delicious crunchy garnish.",

But the basic recipe structure is there and it\u2019s fantastic.\n\nI\u2019m not  a keen fan of creamy curries, so I just half-filled up the emptied can of crushed tomatoes I used with water, and emptied it into the pot.\n\nI used at least twice the amount of ginger and garlic, cut this into slivers and used an immersion blender to blend this with half the can of crushed tomatoes.  The other half a can of crushed tomatoes I simply poured into the pot without blending it.  No need really.\n\nI used two onions instead of one.\n\nI at least doubled the amount of potatoes and sweet potato, and used only one can of drained chickpeas.  Incidentally, after many years of cooking, I discovered that your method of cooking the potatoes is the top-notch one.  Thank you for that.\n\nIf readers do not have garam masala handy, there is a very good homemade blend listed on allrecipes.com as Easy Garam Masala.\n\nI followed the measurements for the other spices, except that I was generous with my teaspoons and my tablespoon.  The cayenne pepper stayed within reasonable boundaries and could still be detected (gently) in the cooked dish.\n\nAll in all, an award-winning dish for me, so I am now collecting the ingredients (e.g., the sweet potato) to prepare this again next week.  And for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn short, great work!",
