I used to like my food really hot, but now at my age, the mustard and crushed chilies seemed a bit much, so I reduced the mustard to 1 tblsp and the crushed chilies to 1/4 tsp.  I also substituted a cup of pinot grigio for the vinegar. I didn't have any chops, so I sliced a chunk of pork tenderloin into 1\" medallions. I doubted that waiting for the meat to go through the rest stage would give enough time for the sauce to reduce, so I heated that in a small saucepan and still ended up adding some corn starch as the pork ended its resting stage. The taste was great. Nice sweet sauce with enough bite to enjoy, without burning my mouth.",
