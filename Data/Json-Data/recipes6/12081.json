They come out a little soft and harden as they cool....One less egg makes them a less soft and they seem to taste better if you make them the night before. Try putting marshmallow fluff or peanut butter between two of them and make delicious sandwich cookies.",

Although the recipe does not say to do so please make sure you roast the hazelnuts in the oven place them on a large clean kitchen towel and fold the towel over. Let the heat \"steam\" them for a minute then rub the hazelnuts through the towel vigorously to remove the skins. Make sure you grind the hazelnuts very finely in a food processor before using them in the recipe. For the reviewer whose pizzelles stuck to the iron did you oil the top and bottoms of your iron? If you do they won't stick. Be sure to throw out the first two cookies you make on the iron though or you'll have a very oily cookie. It is also a good way to make sure the iron is \"clean.\" No one wants to eat microscopic remnants from last years' pizzelles.;)",

Great call because after these set up for a couple minutes they are delightfully crispy and wonderful! I've been making pizzelles a LONG time and this recipe is by far the best one I've used.
