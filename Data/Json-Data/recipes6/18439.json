The recipe says to cook the beets about 15 minutes: it's more like 30 - 45 minutes.\n3.  Almost all sources today will say to process pickled beets 30 minutes, rather than the 10 in this recipe.  Lastly, to those who would peel the beets before cooking - I would encourage you NOT to do so.  Cooking them whole reduces the \"bleeding\" but they're so easy and quick to peel after cooking, and less waste.\nIt may seem that given my comments above that 4 stars is overrating the recipe but I do like the simple nature of Sharon Howard's farmer's wife's recipe and will continue to use it in future whenever I can beets with the changes I've noted",
