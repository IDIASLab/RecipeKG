                "reviewBody": "Doug...This was a great pizza dough...I loved the hint of rye in the final product. This dough recipe made for me two loaves; I immediately made one and refrigerated the second loaf for the next night. There are a few suggestions I'd like to share with readers: 1) Be sure to have a thermometer! It is critical to check the temperature of the water in both steps...You want the water to be NO MORE than 110 degrees F. If it gets any hotter the yeast will get killed! 2) If one has a pizza stone then set it inside the oven on the lowest rack setting while it is preheating (I set my oven for 475 degrees). Having a stone prevents soggy bottom pizza dough. If one doesn't have a stone one can invert a sheet pan on the lowest rack setting. 3) After shaping/rolling out the dough move the dough onto a peel or wooden board that has been generously dusted with both cornmeal and flour. This prevents the dough from sticking when it is time to slide the pizza onto the stone/inverted pan in the very hot oven. My first pizza (I made a Margherita) took 11 minutes to cook; my second pizza (still a Margherita) took 14 minutes to cook (because it was slightly chilled from cooling in the refrigerator overnight - I did take it out to come down to room temp but it's cold now (winter)). Just watch it through the oven door until it's how you like it - try not to open the oven door while it is cooking. Absolutely wonderful tasting pizza dough! Thanks Doug:)",
