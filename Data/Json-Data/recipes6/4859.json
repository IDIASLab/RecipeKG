The consistency is not too thick and not too thin; enough to coat the back of a spoon. I made this recipe in a pressure cooker in 10 minutes then using an immersion blender to smooth it out. I ended up tripling the cayenne pepper though. A tasty and warming way to get your vitamins. Thank you plasticRobot for your recipe.",

It needs more 5 stars!  I rarely follow a recipe to a T, and I usually like to spice things up a bit more. But with health issues that limit safe foods for me, this looked attractive due to the simplicity of the ingredients. The result, it was perfect, made exactly with the ingredients and amounts noted (sans salt, I never add salt to anything.......with the exception of black truffle salt on a few select items).  The only thing I did differently, just because, no real reason, was put all the olive oil in at once.  And I added the cayenne pepper before using my immersion blender to blend the soup.  Was tempted to use more cayenne pepper, but it really was perfect with the exact amount mentioned.  I'm a non-meat eater, but even my carnivore husband enjoyed this one and ate several bowls of it.  Simple and delicious!  Always happy to find another good vegan/vegetarian soup to add to the mix!",

Once I combined the leeks and potatoes, I added garlic powder, thyme, paprika and parsley (saw another review with these additions). Then I blended about 2/3 of the potato mixture and added that back to the soup for a beautiful creaminess. Last, I added some frozen veggies--corn, carrots and green beans. Lots of flavor, still low fat, low calorie and amazingly easy and tasty. Love it!",
