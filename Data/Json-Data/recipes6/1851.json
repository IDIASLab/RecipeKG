I changed milk and butter to almond milk and dairy free Earth balance butter and subbed apple sauce for the egg, and I used the 1 for 1 Bob's Red Mill baking flour with the xantham added already, and skipped the peacans but added dry cherries soaked in hot water and drained, then added 1/2 cup coca powder unsweetened due to all the other sweetness! I followed the rest of the recipe and these turned out decedent! I would encourage everyone else to try these!!!!!!!",

Once I had read that this recipe yields 12 muffins I realised they are supposed to be regular sized muffins, but they were good anyway. As for the flour mentioned in the recipe, according to the Bob's Red Mill site, that particular flour blend is NOT gluten free, but containing whole wheat flour. I used a gluten free blend from this website (Best All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour Blend by pho1962) and thought they were more sponge-like than cake, but still delicious. I left out the xanthan gum. I used the option of pecans and am glad I did as they gave a nice texture to the muffin as well as taste. Thank you BrightBritain for your recipe.",

I wanted a recipe that would be easy enough to change ingredients to make a versatile little dessert cake and still satisfy a sweet tooth.\nchanges I made for 1st batch:\n1 cup all purpose gluten free baking mix, 1/2 cup coconut flour, 1/2 cup coconut oil measured solid then melted, 1/2 cup almond milk,left out nutmeg, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon,  added 1/2 cup coconut unsweetened shredded, 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. all other ingredients as listed.\nI followed instructions including spraying the paper cups with coconut oil spray. topped each cup batter with sprinkle of brown sugar & shredded coconut. Baked 24 mins. cooled in tin 10 min.\nThis made a moist tasty little cake! I was skeptical as when I checked these gems they seemed to be swimming in coconut oil. but they were moist not greasy when done. these are not low fat...but, they are so yummy. Cant wait to try them with blueberries and almonds!",

I made this as gluten free pancakes. OMG!! These were the best pancakes I have ever tasted!! I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose gluten free flour (that way you don't have to add the xanthum gum since it's already in there!) I had to increase the milk to a little more than the ingredient's 1/2 cup to achieve the desired consistency. For dry ingredients I only used the 1 1/2 c flour & cinnamon...no need to add any extra sugar. These are already sweet enough. We didn't add the nuts because go figure they had gluten in them. We added fresh blueberries to half the batch as well...yummy!! It yields 20-24 medium size pancakes.",
