This recipe is very flexible and seldom tastes the same twice in a row. I always make it with a cup of orange juice OR a cup of milk but not both. No need to drain the pineapple. I usually throw in an egg to add creamy richness. I frequently throw in a few frozen strawberries or blueberries. It can be sweetened any way you want I often use brown or white sugar when there s no honey (but maple syrup tastes weird). Sweetened coconut milk is a wonderful addition. Enjoy!",
