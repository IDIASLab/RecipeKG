They're a little hard to finish. It was VERY sweet and is definitely a thing of moderation but as they sat and separated I thought they lost some of the overwhelming sweetness and got better and better. This would also be great with a shot of rum per glass maybe mixed with the syrup instead of the cream soda. It would make it authentic.",

My husband and I both have a major sweet tooth but it was too much for us to finish one glass. I think if we tried it again we'd skip the whipped cream part and/or dilute the syrup a bit by using twice the cream soda and turning it into 8 servings. It looks very pretty if you use the whipped cream topping so it makes a great party drink!",
