Boiling the jam on high heat ensures that it will jell properly and kills bacteria more effectively than on low heat.  Also, I decided to process the jam instead of just refrigerate or freeze.  I ladled the hot jam into hot, sterilized jars, and placed then in a boiling water bath canner and processed for 10 minutes.  All the jars sealed nicely.  Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to try other flavors of jello!",

When I came across this recipe, I thought I'd try it as is, but I had 2 pounds of strawberries in my refrigerator. I chopped up one pound of strawberries and added them to the pot during the cooking stage. What a difference! It turned out really well. I just finished making my second batch in less than a week. I expect to make much more of this this summer (of course, I end up giving quite a bit away). My only tip is to cook the mixture until the rhubarb is soft (I don't even pay attention to cooking times).",

I used 1/2 pkg fruit pectin added to the rhubarb in the beginning, and added real strawberries- about 2 cups. 1/2 the sugar, and made the recipe according to the pectin directions. I still added 1/4 pkg of the jello at the end for color, and it is soooo much better this way..I also did not let the rhubarb sit in sugar. That ruins the natural 'tartness' of the rhubarb. Made as is, the jam tastes like strawberry jello-made this way- it tastes like strawberry rhubarb jam.",
