I found that mixing the butter/margerine was much easier after I melted it. I also left the cookies in the oven for about 2 to 3 minutes more because anything less than that was not solid enough and broke transferring to cooling rack. Other than that this is a fabulous recipe for when I get a sweet tooth! Thank you!",

I did cook the without the eggs and they held up very well. Good drop cookie but comes out rather flat. Recommend you spay the cookiesheet and let the cookies stand a few minutes after baking or they smoosh up and crumble. Don't think I will try these again or if I do I'll add more peanut butter and modify the recipe for a thicker dough.",

I used 1/2 cup Peanut Butter instead of 2 tbsp and instead of chocolate chips (which I didn't have at the time) I chopped up Hershey's kisses. I also added 1 tbsp more cocoa. The end result was delicious slightly chewy and crispy along the edges. They do thin out a bit but I like to make bigger cookies so the \"thinning\" did not really affect my batch. Hope this helps!",
