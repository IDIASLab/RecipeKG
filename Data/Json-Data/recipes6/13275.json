The yolk mixture was too thick to be in a ribbon stage and my custard didn't thicken much and it was quite foamy. Mine was done baking after 20 minutes but I had to drain a lot of fluid out that had gathered between the custard and meringue. But I would definitely suggest this recipe it is interesting and very sweet:) Don't be deterred by the raisins!",
