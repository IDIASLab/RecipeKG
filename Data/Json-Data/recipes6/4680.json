I only cooked mine about 3 1/2 hours on high & the potatoes are mushy & I have a very vintage slow cooker (they don't cook as hot as newer ones). I didn't have any celery so I used celery flakes. I do like dill, but didn't use the full amount. I used low sodium vegetable broth. I have to admit that I do like the broth. After taking a picture of the finished product, I'm going to go tweak it by mashing it up, adding a bit of milk, garlic and pepper.",

I peeled 3 very large russet potatos and chopped them up, I also added some baby carrots to the recipe. I got tired of shuffling around my spices and couldn't find my dill so I added a garlic and onion seasoning I had. I cooked on low for 8 hours but it was perfectly done in 7 hours. The potatos and the carrots have great flavor and melt in your mouth!",
