The cookies were wonderful! They have a soft tender texture not to mention they make your house smell awesome! I also reduced the amount of white chocolate chips but that was mainly for personal preference. I thought baking them at a lower temperature for a little longer worked very well for this particular cookie. I will be adding this recipe to my \"favorite cookie collection\"! YUMMY!",
