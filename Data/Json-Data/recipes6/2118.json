For the hot sauce, I split it between Sriracha\u00ae and Frank's, which was just about spot on for us.  I like the little bit of the Asian flavor from the teriyaki sauce and that little kick you get from the hot sauce.  Used this as a basting sauce on some grilled boneless/skinless thighs, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Joyce, thanks for sharing, this sauce has a lot of possibilities.",
