Packed into sterile jars it's great to share during the upcoming holidays. Be sure to cover the heavier the pan - the better and I add chopped navel orange peel which candies somewhat. The brandy should be added when it's hot and just finished baking. Don't stir just pour over the top. The alcohol evaporates off and the berries plump up with the syrup from the liquid. Don't double the recipe make it twice. Enjoy & share!",

I decreased the sugar because I like the tart taste and left out the brandy because one of my guests dislikes the taste of alcohol in food. In its place I used a little bit of lime extract about halfway through the baking process. The simplicity and flavor were great my only issue was that its so hard to clean the dish afterwards because all the sugar bakes (crystallizes) onto the sides. Next time I will probably try all the same ingredients but just do it on the stove at a lower heat for a longer time and see if that works any better.",
