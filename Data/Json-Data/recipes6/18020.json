I added maybe a 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice used only 3/4 cup of milk (otherwise I think the dough may have been too soft too roll out) and rolled them out approximately 1/2-inch thick. Recipe made 18 scones so I think the dough could be rolled out a little thicker as it doesn't rise in the oven. He-Who-Had-Sleepy-Seeds-in-His-Eyes liked waking up to the aroma of these and greatly enjoyed them with his British tea blend! Thank you Karen for this submission. I will be making these again!",

I used granulated sugar because I hadn't any superfine and I didn't know what mixed spice was so I used pumpkin pie spice. I also put raw sugar on the top before baking. They are good plain with butter and with apple butter. I will make these again. They will travel very well.",
