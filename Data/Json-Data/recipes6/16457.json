                "reviewBody": "Mine turned out really good!  I had read through the comments, and had taken the advice of some of the other readers regarding getting the fudge to harden properly.  First of all, I only used one 7 oz jar of marshmallow cream (1.5 cups).  Secondly, I had to boil it a bit longer to get it to soft ball stage, which is where fudge has to be in order to set properly.  Instead of 5 minutes, it was more like 6 or even 6 1/2 minutes.  You don't have to use a candy thermometer, but at least look on the 'net to see how to test for soft ball stage.  One final tip:  Mix your peanut butter, marshmallow cream and vanilla all together in a heat-proof bowl while you are boiling the other mixture, and then pour the boiling mixture over the peanut butter mixture in the heat-proof bowl.  If you don't, you'll end up with scorched, dark bits of peanut butter throughout your fudge.  It doesn't affect the taste, but it does take away from the appearance.  ",

I just added some mini marshmallows to make up for it (they took a while to dissolve though so I won't do that again). It doesn't cut very nicely but I guess that's the price you pay for such a moist and creamy fudge. It doesn't say whether to put it in the fridge so I did to see if it would cut easier and it did.

No thermometers, no \"soft-ball\" knowledge required.  The fudge was creamy and fattening - just the way fudge should be!  I got rave reviews from my workplace and my husband's co-workers as well (couldn't keep it in the house for fear of having to buy a new wardrobe!).  One hint to people who want to try it:  Mix all your \"non-cooked\" ingredients before cooking the rest of the mixture; the cooked portion cools quickly and if you aren't careful, you could end up with a sugary concrete mixture in your pan.  I'll be using this recipe all the time!",

However the above recipe is a tad incorrect which is why everyone is having issues with it setting up and not tasting peanut buttery enough. I ALWAYS double this recipe because it tastes so much better that way. When doubling use 2 1/2 cups peanut butter and a large jar of marshmallow fluff. Do a full rolling boil for 5 minutes. The grainy taste happens when you don't do the boil long enough. When pouring into the pan the fudge should not be more than 1/2 inch to an inch thick. If its too thick it won't set.",
