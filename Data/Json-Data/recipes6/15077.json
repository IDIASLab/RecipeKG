I didn't have the full amount of wheat gluten. I did use a package of active dry yeast. I guess I did change up the recipe but the bread is terrific! Thanks!",

I'd probably add some oats next time to make it a little more grainy--I love the texture of oats or cracked wheat in breads. I did use spelt flour bc that's what I've got. Thanks for the recipe!",

I currently don't have a bread machine so made a couple changes as mentioned by some other reviewers. Used 3/4 cup spent grain rather than 1/4 cup no powdered milk no rye flour and instead used 2 cups whole wheat flour no vital wheat gluten and used 2 tsp. of yeast. Mix honey sugar yeast and warm water (100-110 F) cover and let sit for 10 min. Reserve 1/4 cup bread flour and set aside to roll dough in later for the counter. Add the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and mix. Knead dough and make sure butter has broken up. Roll dough into a ball and place into bowl cover and set in a warm place for 30-40min. It is ready when you push a finger and indent remains. Pull at edges of dough and push into center rather than punching directly as we're used to doing with such recipes. Lightly sprinkle the flour that you reserved onto the work surface and place dough on you may roll it out with a rolling pin but I just pull it with my hands into a roughly rectangular shape with one end being about the length of the bread pan. Roll up and pinch seam and place seam side down into buttered/oiled bread pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place for about 30-40min or until top of dough rises about 1 inch above the edge of the bread pan. Preheat oven to 375 bake 40 min.",
