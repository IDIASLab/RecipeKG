Made it just as it's written, don't think I would change anything (except make lots more sauce!).\nThe mozzarella stuffing is a neat touch,  but it would have been just as good to top with shredded mozz. Don't overwork the meatballs and you'll have a great and surprisingly quick and easy meal that everyone will love.",

We didn't have French Onion mix so my first attempt was with a regular onion mix. The only change i made was to use a block of cheese instead of fresh balls. I waited until Hubby had cooed over it during dinner to tell him it was chicken. I think he's still in shock. Thanks so much for the recipe - we'll have it again with French Onion mix next time.",
