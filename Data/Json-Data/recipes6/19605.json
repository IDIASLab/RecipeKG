I also used only one tablespoon of sugar in the graham cracker crust and slightly reduced the amount of sugar in the filling, while adding more lemon juice (a full teaspoon).  This recipe was creamy yet light, and full of cheesy blueberry goodness!  The whole pan was gone by morning, and only four people shared it.\r\n**ETA**  I made this several more times for my diabetic aunt and mother.  I subsituted 3/4 cup of splenda for the sugar, and it was JUST AS GOOD!  We also tried it with blackberries and sliced strawberries, and it was still absolutely delicious!",

Most importantly, USE FRESH BLUEBERRIES or other fresh fruit!  I like to make it in a 9 x 9 pan so the whole thing isn't quite so thick. For the crust, we like a bit more so we use 2 cups of graham crackers but keep the other ingredients the same.  You can buy pre-crumbled graham crackers and it makes it so much easier!  For the filling, we only use 3/4 cup sugar but we use a half teaspoon more of both vanilla and lemon juice.  Believe me it makes a difference.  Last thing, I've also made it with \"lite\" cream cheese and cool whip, and it's a little less rich but just as good, you can go either way.  This dessert is so good and we're happy to have found it!",

It's kind of like eating a cheesecake mousse. The photo presently being used with this recipe actually looks pretty much like mine did. Doesn't really work well cutting into bars I truly think it would work better being served in little pudding dishes. Also as I read on one of the reviews adding the vanilla was left out of the instructions so you could very well miss it. It did taste good but I wished it would have had a more firm texture.",
