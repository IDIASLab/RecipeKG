        "description": "Skate (or ray) is a delicious, yet underused, fish. The flesh is creamy white, with a texture all its own; it's not flaky like most fish, but comes apart in long shreds when cooked. Don't be put off by the cartilage, and don't try to remove it before cooking. After it's done, the flesh can easily be lifted off the fan-like skeleton. I like this served with a colorful mix of sauteed vegetables and pasta.",
