Thanks for such an easy way to fix a dinner!  EDIT:  The third time I made this I'd run out of eggs so used mayonnaise to coat the chicken.  The panko stayed on even better with that.  Just an idea for others!  We love this dinner!",

Used Egg Beaters in place of the eggs and just sprinkled a little bit of the mozzarella on the chicken tenders. Comes together quickly and tastes great (sort of like boneless buffalo wings).
