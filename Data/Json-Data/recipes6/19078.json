I turned up the oven and even sprayed a little Pam on them. They were hard and overly crispy on the ends and yet seemingly undone in the middle. There was no way to salvage these. The filling however is actually very good but I used real crab vs. imitation and green onion as it's milder in flavor. This is definitely a case where I should have paid attention to the lower ratings.....",

This recipe is very easy to work with and it makes a lot. I made a half batch with fat-free cream cheese and it made 30 rangoons. I think nothing can compare to a \"fried\" crab rangoon but this was very good and I most definitely will be making them again. I added some fresh chives in the cream cheese mixture. I baked on parchment paper rather than spraying a cookie sheet. Mine came out nice and crispy. To keep my edges from getting hard I folded them up and attached to the seams with water. I used a pastry brush dipped in water rather than my fingers. This method just seemed to go faster.

They are VERY simple to make and they crisped up *fairly* well in the oven...I just know that the texture of the fried ones is so much better. Since this isn't something we'll make frequently, I think I'll try pan frying them in a bit of oil next time...just to see if we can get the texture a little crunchier. I also used green onion instead of regular onion. Served them with a sauce of orange marmalade, chili-garlic sauce and a splash or two of rice wine vinegar...very tasty. Thanks for a good recipe.",
