I added 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Rays and the apple cider vinegar.  It cooked 3 hours on low and it was up to temperature.  I drained out the liquid from the pot, added 3 Tablespoons of tomato paste to it and used that as a substitute for the rest of the bbq sauce.  I added the rest of the ingredients and cooked for another hour.  Delicious.",
