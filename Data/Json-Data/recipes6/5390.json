However, I\u2019m finding the instant pot more trouble than it\u2019s worth so I decided to make this in a stockpot on the stove. I saut\u00e9ed the onion in butter for 5 minutes then added a heaping tablespoon of garlic. I used frozen corn, which I thought worked well. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth and also added a can of diced hot green chilies and a tablespoon of sugar. I let simmer over an hour before smashing some of the potatoes and adding the cup of cream. It was even better the 2nd night. I will definitely make again and will continue to make on the stove since clean up is so much easier.",

I hit it a few times with an immersion stick blender instead of mashing some and returning it to the pot. The 2nd time I added about a 1/2 cup of diced ham at the same time as the corn & potatoes. The last time, along with the ham, I added 1/2 cup grated Pepper Jack cheese with the cream.  When I put the cooker on 'simmer' at the end, I added 2 Tb spoons of corn starch mixed into some cold milk to thicken it up a bit more. Great recipe as is or fine tuned to your personal preferences.",
