Don't worry about making the ring - it normally doesn't hold together, and the individual ones are just as good and probably preferable (people avoid breaking things apart).  Great way to make cream puffs - and you can avoid drawing circles.  I made these twice of how quick it is.  Highly recommended.",

I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have semi-sweet morsels on hand so I substituted 3 squares of semi-sweet baking squares chopped up. My puffs did not stick together in a ring when I removed from the baking sheet but that was okay I just placed them back together on the serving tray. Also I ended up just cutting the top off each puff pulled out the \"webbing\" inside filled with the cream and put the top back on. Very yummy! Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will definitely make this again!",
