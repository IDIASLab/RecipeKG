Firstly, I doubled the recipe so my fiance and I would have leftovers for the next day. Instead of using canned applesauce, I just bought a few extra apples, diced them, heated on a skillet until tender, and then added about 2 tbsp (i may have gone overboard ;) of brown sugar to make the applesauce (i'm not a huge fan of cinnamon, so I didn't add any to that). Then, instead of using butter to cook the apple/onion mixture, I used vegetable oil. I followed the rest of the recipe as-is, and man did they turn out awesome. The cook time was about 35 minutes in the oven on 375.",
