This recipe checks all the right boxes; easy to make, great flavor and some nice but not overwhelming heat! We made a grilled jerk chicken recipe tonight and wanted to have a great side dish and tried this. If you like rice and beans; you will undoubtedly love this! I liked despite not being a fan of kidney beans and need to figure out a way to replicate bean-free. I used a whole jalape\u00f1o as no habenaro on hand (and good thing or my husband would have found too hot for him). I also used sweet yellow onion vs green (used all my green onions for the chicken).  Thank you! I will try this one again!",
