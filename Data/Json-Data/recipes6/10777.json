I used a full pint of blueberries and substituted margarine for the butter and it worked just fine.  I like the taste of vanilla, so I doubled the amount called for.  I also threw in a dash.....and I do mean a DASH of cinammon simply based upon personal preferance.  Thanks for the recipe Irene!",

First of all, it's a lot of work to make with many different steps and dishes used.  Secondly, when it was done and I tried some, it didn't taste as good as I expected.  It wasn't bad, but tasted like something I could have gotten from a mix.  It was moist, but the cake is not very flavorful. I don't think the blueberries make up much for what the cake seems to lack. (I had cream cheese frosting in my pantry, so I added some to the top to see if it would taste better.  It didn't help, and added an odd flavor.)",

It's always nice when you can find a recipe that uses ingredients that are identifiable but can stand up to a grocery store product. If you like mixes better then go ahead and enjoy your high fructose corn syrup. \nI added a little extra vanilla just to enhance the flavor and doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 cake, otherwise nothing was altered. One word of caution: the batter will be very thick so care should be taken when adding the blueberries and egg whites so as not to bruise the berries. This cake is very moist and not overbearingly sweet - much better than a mix! This would also make lovely muffins. Thank you so much Irene, this is definitely a new favorite!",
