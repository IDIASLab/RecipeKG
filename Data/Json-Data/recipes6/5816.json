We did add black beans, which was a really good addition. I sauteed red and yellow peppers with the corn and added the meat half-way through since it was fresh off the grill. I heated the beans with the salsa and mixed it all together and added on top of brown rice. Our only complaint was it was a little dry. That's easily fixable. I just had leftovers...added more beans and salsa and a little water. Sprinkled with cheese and re-heated...liked it better the 2nd time (more moist). This will be something we will keep in the rotation for a quick meal in a bowl. Thanks!!!",

Will make again very soon.   thanks for the recipe",
