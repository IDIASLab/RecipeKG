I used only half of the onion, and substituted 3/4 cup of skim milk instead of the heavy cream to cut back on calories. The addition of Italian seasoning added an extra zip and zing. Served over fresh cheese ravioli and with a side green salad, it was a fantastic and simple meal. If you double the recipe, you can freeze the remainder of sauce and have on hand for guests or cold nights when you crave comforting pasta dishes. A terrific recipe that I will make again.",

I suspect this could be thickened without sacrificing too much flavor by adding flour according to taste. Flour is usually an ingredient in cream sauces, but is absent from this particular recipe. Spices and tomatoes may need to be increased if flour is added, but the sauce should become satisfactorily viscous. I suggest adding flour in small quantities, being cautious not to use too much.",

One complaint: this really only made enough for 3 servings, no way 5 unless this was for a side dish. Thank you.",

So here's what I did...like another member, after cooking tomatoes, onion, garlic and spices in saucepan, I put mixture into blender and pureed.  Then I put back into saucepan, stirred in 3/4 cup nonfat milk (in place of heavy cream) and butter.  I left out sugar altogether.  Didn't need it.  I added a small amount of grated parmesan cheese to give it an extra kick.  What I got was a sauce that tasted like it was full of fat and calories, but it was actually almost fat free and very healthy!  Not to mention, it was EXTREMELY easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!",
