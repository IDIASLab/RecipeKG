I made a couple of changes to it by adding two tablespoons of cornstarch, and instead of water I used a 1/4 cup of lemon juice like with all other fresh berry cobblers I've made. For the crust I used milk instead of cream so it wouldnt be as rich. I must say this is the best cobbler I have eaten in years!!! The lemon juice adds a balance to the sweetness caused by the sugar and berries. Not overpowering, not tart. This is the closest I have come in years to a recipe that was like my grandmothers. A definite REPEAT!!",

I used half the water, and double the amount of cornstarch.  I also added a few drops of red food coloring for more vivid color. I also sprinkled the biscuit topping with demerara sugar. It worked out perfectly. Next time however, I plan to up the sugar to 1-1/2 T. and reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp. I found the topping could have been a little sweeter and at the same time I detected the salt more than I liked. All around, a delicious, homespun dessert. Loved it.",

Even though I reduced the water by 1/2 cup there was still quite a bit of liquid at the bottom of the dish - which would be lovely if you were serving this with ice cream becaus eyou could spoon it over the top.",

I doubled the topping...next time I will add a little more heavy cream to make the dough a little softer. I doubled the cornstarch and kept the water the same and I used about 8 cups of strawberries. Here is what I learned: 1 this recipe only needs about 1/4 cup of water 2 tbsp cornstarch same amount of sugar...NOT cooked. Mix it cold and coat the strawberries. This will allow for the cornstarch mixture to thicken with the extra juice from the berries decreasing the \"runny liquid\". Also I increased the cooking time to about 45 minutes to allow the dough to cook all the way through. I added some Rodelle Vanilla to the dough. The topping was very good and the strawberry part was good as well. I will make this again however will use the following: 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of water will not cook the cornstarch/sugar/lemon juice mix. Thank you for a good recipe!",
