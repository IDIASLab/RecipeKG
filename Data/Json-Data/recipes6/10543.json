They tasted great! I also noticed that it called for a lot of baking squares, so I used chocolate chips. This worked, but needed a lot of them. So, I fixed it by mixing 6 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1/4 cup butter, and 7 tablespoons sugar in replacement. They turned out exactly the same as before, success!",

I was also short 2 squares of chocolate, so I substituted 3tbsp cocoa and 1tbsp butter for each square.\n\n  Also, if you use larger chocolate chips, mix them in with the flour -- that way they'll stay even distributed instead of sinking to the bottom.  AND!  If you're worried about your muffins sticking to the paper cups, LIGHTLY spray them with cooking spray, and it'll be fine.\n\nDid I mention that these are amazing?  Because they are.  Good luck!",

I then made another batch making a few more adjustments/additions and achieved exactly what I was looking for in a double chocolate muffin; very rich and moist (similar to the ones I used to buy at Superstore). I increased the chocolate to 8 ounces as I found the first batch wasn't \"chocolately\" enough (yes I am a chocoholic) by using 4 ounces of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate and 4 ounces of Baker's Premium dark chocolate 1/2 cup of sour cream 2 eggs 1/3 cup of 3% milk 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt (not fat-free) 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup packed golden brown sugar. It took 22 minutes at 400 degrees F for them to bake and I started checking at 18 minutes just to be sure I didn't over-cook them. I know this isn't the healthiest recipe but if you're going to eat a double chocolate muffin I say throw caution to the wind and enjoy!",
