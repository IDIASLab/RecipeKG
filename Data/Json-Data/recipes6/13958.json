I wasn't sure how to cut the meat--the recipe title says \"sliced \" but the directions say \"cubed.\" I found cubing it even cut small made it hard to keep on the bread and it was very sloppy to pick up. I tried shredding it in the food processor but that absorbed all the liquid and it was dry. The last time we sliced it thin and ate it open-faced. It stayed on the bread and we didn't have to worry about the sauce spilling all over the place.",
