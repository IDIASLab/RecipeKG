The frosting taste too much like cream cheese and is not stiff enough for frosting a layered cake. It is NOT runny, and will work great on a single layer or cupcakes. However, after frosting my 3-layer cake, I placed my cake in the fridge to allow the frosting to stiffen even more. And, 5 minutes later I opened the fridge door and found my top layer lying in front of the cake plate. For those of you who are questioning if a Red Velvet cake is a chocolate cake, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d And, this cake is by no means in the chocolate cake category. It just does not taste like chocolate. For \u2018just a cake\u2019, it is good. But, not for Red Velvet because, again, it should be a chocolate cake. My suggestion to alter this recipe would be to add some confectioners sugar, vanilla flavor, and a dab of flour to the frosting. As far as the cake itself, I would reduce the eggs to 2 and then add 3 eggs whites, double or triple the cocoa, and cook for 10 minutes longer.",

And I would definitely sift the cocoa with the flour and add food coloring to butter sugar mix. I have submitted a photo of the cake i made, just click on the picture on the recipe to see the color I acheived following the recipe exactly, if you are going for a deeper red I would add 2-3 times the amount of food coloring. To ice the cake I would make sure you let the white chocolate cool to luke warm because if th icing is to warm you won't be able to work with it. Also to lower the amount of fat I used 8 oz regular cream cheese and 8 oz fat free cream cheese and it tastes great. I have to say i was shocked by the amount of butter in this cake but it tasted sooooo good, we had to give some of it away or we woul dhave been balloons.",

For those of you out there who like me do not like the flavor or use of food coloring please keep in mind the original red velvet cake recipe calls for the use of red sugar beets. So taking that as a clue I put some red sugar beets through the juicer and used that juice instead of the artifical red food coloring. It came out beautifully and super moist!",

The recipe should have asked for 3 9-in. pans and even then I am not sure the batter would have fit properly. The pans kept dripping making a mess in the oven. Another matter: in step 1 the recipe specifies 350 F as the oven temperature to be used. In step 5 however the temperature asked for is 325 F. I used 325 F and ended up having to keep the pans in the oven for about 15 more minutes at 350 F. other than than that it did come out well and was highly liked. Will make it again but using the 9-in. pans.",

I took other's advice with the coco by putting 4 1/2 Tablespoons with the flour and sifting it together also used 2 1/2 bottles (2 1/2 ounces) of red food coloring used 3 9\" cake pans and baking it at 340 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes. It came out perfectly. I think the recipe would be right if the person who posted it had told us to put 1 pan in at a time on 325 for 25 minutes. I bet that is what the recipe should be!!!! We had 6 or 7 Foreign Exchange students from New Zealand Germany Columbia Austria Switzerland Australia and Italy and most laughed and said they all made the comment that they had never seen a red cake and one of them thought the cake was bleeding. It was funny! Everyone raved over the cake. I thought it was wonderful!!!! I made the icing the night before and made sure it was cold...it made it thicker so it wasn't runny! Then after spreading the icing I refrigerated the cake so it the icing wouldn't be too runny! It had a GREAT flavor! It is an EASY cake to make!!! Thank you!",

Then for the left over cake mix bake in bread pan until done once done let sit until almost cool then crumball for cake toping or to decorate cake it makes it look elegant I like to sprinkle it on the sides and just a small pile on the top!
