I ground up my ham with all of the ingredients except the broccoli then mixed that in by hand. The problem was they fell apart really easily. Definitely use a non-stick skillet because I didn't at first and had to switch since they were in pieces by the time I got them flipped over. I think it's a really good idea - they just need to be a little more cohesive. I may try them in the oven some time.",

Because it was delicious and I think it was my fault. I had pulsed the broccoli and onion in the food processor (but not too fine) and I think I should have spent some time squeezing/draining them before adding to the ham. The mix was so wet I decided to fry a trial patty and ended up with ham hash. To salvage the mix I dumped in a bunch of bread crumbs and wheat bran. It was still pretty loose but I found if I made the patties very thin and cooked over low heat so they could firm up enough to be flipped without burning I ended up with a really nice texture. I suggest not adding salt at all until you've tasted it ham is usually very salty already as is the cheese. When I make these again (and I will) I'll make sure to drain the veggies as a separate step. Served with a mayo/honey/mustard sauce I just winged plain green beans and Kettle chips.",
