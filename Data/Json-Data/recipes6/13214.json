I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and added a couple of chopped plum tomatoes.  The color looked great.  I also served a mix of scallops and shrimp.  Serve with a nice light salad.

I found the olive oil to be a little much so will cut back next time. We're big scallop fans so will also add more of those as well. Thanks for sharing. We'll definitely be making again!",
