I omitted both the margarine (and if I had wanted the extra calories, I would have used butter for its superior taste) and sugar, which is unnecessary in properly prepared tomato recipes. Also cut the soda to a mere sprinkle. The result was perfection. I incorporated milk instead of cream for a lighter, fresher flavor. For those of you who have had problems with the cream curdling, try tempering the cream. After heating it, add a spoonful of the hot soup into it and stir it in. Add another couple of spoonfuls and stir. After adding about a cup of hot soup this way, whisk your cream mixture into the pot of hot soup. The soup should be at the barest simmer, not a rippin' boil. Possibilities for garnishes of your bowls of soup include julienne strips of fresh basil leaves, a tsp of freshly grated Parmesan or Asiago, or finely minced pepperoni.",

This makes the soup recipe \"yours\" I like to add an italian spice mix with crushed red pepper and some balsamic vinegar at the very end. SO good.\n\nMany thanks to Lee Ann for this awesome recipe!",

I agree with the others about running it through a blender briefly.  A little chunkyness is good tho.  I have eaten it without the cream, and it is still good, however I like it best with just a cup of half and half added.  Also, if you use tomato's with garlic and basil, reduce the chicken stock by half, and omit the cream, you have a great and easy marinara!",

I will try it myself just to see how it tastes without the sugar. Tomatoes can be sweet anyway.

I had 40 people to feed, and since it was a nice Fall day, I thought I would do some comfort food.  I made this recipe and the grilled cheese recipe also from this website.  When I returned to help clean up, you would not believe the amazing comments that I received.  Actually, it was a bit overwhelming.  Everyone thought the soup and sandwiches were out of this world and received many requests for the recipe.  I heard that the one musician ate 3 bowls and then someone decided that it was even more fun to drink the soup from a Styrofoam cup.  Hey, whatever makes them happy, makes me happy.  Thank you so much for helping me to make the arts/tech/productions teams happy!  I will definitely make this for one of our Christmas rehearsals in December!",
