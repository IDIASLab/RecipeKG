It sounded so good and I was so excited about making it but the final result was bland and a mix of flavors that just didn't blend well. The cinnamon and pecan topping didn't blend at all with the fruity flavor of the cake and the chocolate chips scattered throughout were horrible. It was a cake that couldn't make up its mind on what it should taste like. It was neither fruity enough to be a fruit cake nor chocolaty enough to be a chocolate cake. Won't be making this one again.",
