                "reviewBody": "This was really good. I think it could benefit from an extra can of beans since it's called afterall Bean Soup. The end result was missing a little something - it definitely needed some salt and I also ended up adding red pepper/garlic seasoning blend I had on hand. Yum! I also think 3 cans of veggie stock is plenty (personal preference on soup thickness) so I stopped adding after the 3rd can. And since measurements are given in 'cans' it'd be simpler to just add 1 can of chicken stock instead of 1 cup. The canned tomatoes I used were roasted garlic flavor but any flavor would definitely be good in this soup. I did saute the spinach but I just stirred it into the pot instead of placing some in the bottom of the bowls. I think you could also skip this sauteing step and just add the raw spinach during the last few mins. Very tasty recipe that smells amazing while it's cooking! Thanks AJ for sharing your recipe!",

The only things I changed was to add 2 tsp of Italian seasoning \"Fire Roasted\" tomatoes upped to 2 cans of beans and added some cabbage I wanted to use up. I also used chicken stock rather than vegetable because that's what I had on hand. Other than that everything else was the same! Served it up with some good crusty bread! Good hearty warm soup for a damp cold night! Thanks AJ!!",

I added another can of beans for extra protein and threw in slices of a yellow squash that needed to be used before going bad. With the canned beans canned tomatoes pesto sauce and all the stock you wouldn't think that it would need additional salt but I added about 1.5 teaspoons of it (remember I doubled my recipe!). I did not saute the spinach. Instead when the soup was done I simply put a small handful of the raw spinach leaves into each bowl and ladled the hot soup over the top. Within seconds the spinach wilts and you'll save yourself from having to wash another pan! I grated fresh romano cheese over the top of each bowl and served with buttery garlic bread. The kids slurped it up - veggies and all!;-)",

I used 1 can of tomatoes and almost doubled everything else tripped garlic. added fresh Italian parsley right before serving. served with toasted baguette which I rubbed w fresh garlic and drizzled w evoo. 100% hit! last time I added some cooked ditlani pasta. placed the pasta w fresh spinach in bowl and put hot soup on top. this time no ditlani.
