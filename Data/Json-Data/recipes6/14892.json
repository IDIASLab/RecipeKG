First of all, I used 1 1/2 cups of chunky applesauce and only 1/4 cup of oil.  I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I doubled all the spices- this was definitely a must for me.  I didn't think the bread was even that spicy like that, especially for a recipe called SPICED Applesauce Bread.  I added a crumb topping of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as well.  This turned this bread into a real treat!  I loved how moist the bread was, and it made my house smell amazing while it baked.  I'm definitely not a baker (cooking is much more my cup of tea), so if I can make an amazing applesauce bread with this recipe, anybody can!",

It does need more sweetness, so the 2nd time, I increased the sugar by a 1/4 cup.  Use all brown sugar for more flavor.  And doubling the cinnamon and nutmeg is a must.  I also sprinkle the top with brown sugar b4 baking, which makes a nice, crunchy sweet crust on top.  Cooking time is definitely longer than 1 hour considering how much moisture is in this.  I baked mine for 1 hour, 15 min.  Was perfectly moist.  And add 1 cup chopped apples.  The apples will cook down and be tender and adds more flavor to this.  1 cup = 1 medium sized apple. Kids love this bread and with slight alterations, it's 5 stars.  Tip -cover tightly with foil to let it steam for 30 min. or more.  This locks in the moisture and a trick for all loaf breads.",

Seems only fair.\n\nI've been doing my best to use what I had on hand so making this bread was a challenge. I used half brown/half white sugar (I only had a half cup of white on hand) and added in another 1/4 c. of applesauce as I only had one egg. (I used homemade slow cooker applesauce that I made yesterday, a recipe also from this site.) Since I had little white flour on hand, I did a cup of white, then ground a half cup of oats in my blender and added that to a half cup of whole wheat flour to make a full cup.\nI also used a stick of margerine in place of the vegetable oil to make the batter fluffier.\n\nBefore I put the loaves in the oven, I \nsprinkled some brown sugar over the top.\n\nThey turned out beautifully. Not exactly according to the recipe, but workable with what I have on hand. Plus, they smell divine!\n\nFor those of you who are thinking of making this, use a homemade chunky applesauce. You'll appreciate the flavor and texture better with homemade over storebought.\n\nBTW, this made two loaves that were a bit on the thinner side, to decrease cooking time.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: This bread turned out SO good. Try it with my changes. You'll thank me. We've already eaten one of the loaves.",

I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose, increasing the spices by a bit.  I baked it for the directed time (at 325 since I was using a glass pan) and it came out very moist and tasty!  Thanks! **I make this recipe almost every week now for my kids to snack on and I think I've perfected it to suit their taste -- I add 3/4 c. chopped apples, 3/4 c. chopped pecans and I'm down to 1/3 c. of BROWN sugar.

It's also a great base to \"tweak\" this to whatever you have on hand or whatever your tastebuds desire.  I opted to use butter vs. veg. oil and creamed that will all brown sugar until nice and fluffy. I used chunky applesauce and added an additional chopped apple.  The more apple flavor the better, right?  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1 heaping tsp. of vanilla.  I left out the nuts as I didn't have any on hand.  I topped this with some turbinado sugar before topping it into the oven to give it some added crunch and baked for a little over an hour.
