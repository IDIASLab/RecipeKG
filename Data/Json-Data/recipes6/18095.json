It's not really a traditional tasting chili - more like chili meets sloppy joe. It's not overly spicy and a little sweet with the addition of the sugar which I wan't sure about at first but after it simmered for a number of hours was fabulous. In addition to the onion I added a green pepper and sauteed them both until tender then added them to the chili. I used 3 (14.5 ounce) cans of beans vs. 4 - 2 kidney and 1 pinto and fire roasted diced tomatoes vs. plain plus 2 tsp. of cumin. I love the addition of beer and used Sam Adam's lager. If you don't have any beer on hand (we never seem to have that problem in our house) or you just don't want to part with any you can substitute beef broth. I let this cook low and slow for 6 hours and it got nice and thick. My husband who is a big fan of chili just loved this and I was thrilled because this recipe made a ton. I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and served it with a side of cornbread - very filling.",

We don't like things too sweet so I cut the sugar in half. I thought it wouldn't be spicy enough with only 2 Tablespoons of chili seasoning but thought I would rectify that situation at the end if needed. No need it was perfect!! It is not a very spicy chili with almost a cross between a sloppy joe and chili flavor. There are a lot of beans which we loved but if you are not a big fan cut back. This is not a traditional chili but it is one I will make again and again. Not only did hubby rave but gasp! my finicky child did too.",

Great for a fall dinner with friends. I would serve with either cornbread and beer or red wine and french bread. A tangy salad with vinaigrette would be perfect on the side.",
