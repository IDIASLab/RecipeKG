I thought that 2T of poultry seasoning was a little too much I will use less next time (I could taste it a little more than I would have liked). Also - the 2T of melted butter wasn't enough liquid for the dumplings so I had to add water to the mixture - but they were fantastic dumplings! We would definitely make it again it was very easy and tasty. My husband recommended thickening and putting in a pie crust.",

I also had to use some water for the dumplings as another had stated. I didn't have time to cook it for 6hrs so I cooked it on high for 4hrs and put the dumplings in for the last 30 min I let the dumplings cook for 15min then took them out and thickened the soup with corn starch and water as my hubby doesn't like thin soups. Once I thickened the soup I put the dumplings back in the crock pot and con't to let them simmer for 15min. My hubby said it was the best turkey soup he had tried even better than his grandma's which is a huge deal. Happy cooking!!",
