Oranges were not common in ordinary Swedish homes in the early 19th century so skip the orange ingredients. Cut into pig shapes? Must be another American custom. Hearts stars ruffle-edged rounds fir trees sometimes reindeer are traditional shapes but especially hearts and stars. And making a small hole off-center to permit hanging on a ribbon on the tree is very traditional.",
