I made it a few times before I actually wrote the recipe down. This is a hit with my family every time and my sister requests it frequently. It's moist, flavorful, juicy, and really good as a leftover if you slice it and fry it. It's hard to go wrong with bacon and cheese! Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",
