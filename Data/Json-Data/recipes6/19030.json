The 5 star rating is with the changes. It really becomes a different recipe after being changed so much. I kind of question how well it would work without those changes. By the way my apple and butter mixture floated to the top when I poured in the batter. I didn't expect that but it worked out great.",

Then I add the batter and and top with brown sugar and bake at 425 for 20 mins. DELISH!!",

It puffed was brown looked done set it on the table to serve it and the inside was still runny as could be. It ended up taking almost an hour to get done. I will compare my other recipe to this one and maybe try it when I find it but will not make this again-apples and eggs do not go well with this family.",

I read some of the reviews and went by what a few people said I reduced the milk to 1 cup I also used only 1/2cup of all-purpose flour and added 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little more healthy. I substituted Stevia sweetener for the sugar for health purposes and increased the cinnamon to 1/2tsp because we love cinnamon. This kind of reminded me of a caramelized apple upside down cake i make for Thanksgiving and I decided to caramelize the apples in the butter and brown sugar and drizzled a little honey over it and let that simmer on low heat for a couple minutes and flipped the apples over and let them finish caramelizing for a couple more minutes. I didn't have a 9x9in square pan so I just used a 9inch pie plate. I sprayed it with cooking spray first thank goodness I did poured the apples on the bottom and then poured the batter on top. I had to cook it for 23 minutes for it to get done all the way and it was beautiful when it came out. We loved it didn't even need to put syrup on it. I will definitely make this again using my tweaks. Yummy and healthy can't beat that!",
