First, I tear up 12 slices of cinnamon swirl bread instead of the French bread and put into the 13x9 pan then I pour the cream mixture over the bread and stir until the bread soaks it up. Then I bake it in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes, or until it is crisp. It is sooo yummy!\nI often make up a few and keep them uncooked in the freezer. When I am ready to use one, I pull it out and let it thaw and bake as normal! We have it every Christmas morning.",

I mixed the liquid ingredients in a jelly roll pan and the sugar easily disolved with no mess.

Make sure you cut the bread in thick slices and let it soak for the full 5 minutes, if you don't the orange flavor doesn't infuse very well.  My kids, 4 & 3, both ate THREE pieces of this french toast they loved it that much.  I was able to cook the whole loaf of bread on my electric griddle.",
