(At that point of course it is no longer vegan but that isn't a concern for my family.) The soup was the perfect consistency and the coconut milk gave it a delectable creaminess. It tasted reminiscent of pumpkin pie- probably because of the ginger and cinnamon- and the curry was not overpowering. I suppose that could be different depending on the potency of the curry powder and the soup taster's pallet sensitivity but it was fine for us. The recipe calls for about 7 cups of liquids plus the pureed carrots. I think I wound up using more than two pounds maybe closer to four pounds since I just used about 10 medium to longish carrots and didn't weigh them first but I had about 12 or so cups of soup when all was said and done. Not that I mind though because the soup is delicious!",
