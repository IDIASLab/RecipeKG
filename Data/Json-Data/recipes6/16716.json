Last week I'd made a tried and true version, and popped the leftovers into my freezer.  Yesterday I tried your version, and proceeded to throw out what I had stored in my freezer from the prior week!  Yes, your version was that good!  My only tweakings were that I baked it in an 8 x 8 pan, and I added 1/2 tsp salt to the recipe.  Baked it for 25 minutes, and your recipe was the hit of my dinner!  The combination of cream with the oil yielded flavor and moistness. I don't think I need to try any other cornbread recipe.  This one will be made into muffins, cornbread, cornsticks, etc. many many times. \r\nBest wishes,\r\nJeff",

Have to believe it's partly because this one is sweet, which he mentioned right away that he noticed and liked.  I added a minced jalapeno pepper and a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese, both of which were perfect fits for the sweeter cornbread. Nice balance of cornmeal and flour so that while these had a bold, cornmeal flavor, they were still light, fluffy and moist.  I also think this definitely needed the 1/2 tsp. salt I added to make the flavor come alive - it was glaringly missing from the recipe. This made 12, plump and nicely rounded muffins, perfectly golden and a little crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside - 400 degrees, about 19-20 minutes.",
