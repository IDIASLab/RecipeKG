It was potent enough.-Set aside 12 whole cherries for decoration and chop the rest for the filling.-Double the buttercream icing recipe to ice the layers, top & sides of the cake, and also reserve about 1c. of icing to use as rosettes later. (If you don't have an icing pipe, simply put icing in a plastic baggie and snip one of the corners. Press the icing out.) Press out 12 icing rosettes  and use them as a base on which to put the 12 reserved whole bing cherries. It looks really pretty! Delicious cake!",

The chocolate cake part is pretty basic but the Kirschwasser lifts it up and the rich buttercream is a nice contrast to the outside coating of whipped cream. Notes: I used 9 inch cake pans so the cake was not too tall. Also I added 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the whipped cream frosting. Even with the added sugar the cake was not overly sweet -- it was just right. Finally this is not a cake for kids -- the kirschwasser is pretty strong and the alcohol taste will probably turn them off.",

                "reviewBody": "This cake stole the show at a pre-Valentine Party and not a crumb was left afterwards. I recommend allowing a day for the syrup to soak through the cake in the fridge (covered of course, cakes pick up odors and flavors and dry out). The high alcohol content mellows out over time. I assembled the cake(with the cherry buttercream filling minus the whipped cream frosting) on a tin pizza platter - you know the disposable type. I was glad I did because the cake is quite fragile after soaking. I chose not to sweeten the whipped cream because I had an ample amount of shaved semi-sweet chocolate on hand to sprinkle over the entire cake which sweetened the whipped cream. I used 1/4 cup of Kirshwasser for the syrup and brushed it generously over the cake and opted to use maraschino cherries for garnish on top- just for appeal. I might use more Kirsh next time. I could hardly taste it. To those of you who had trouble finding Kirshwasser-I thought I was running into the same problen at my local liquor store. The vendor told me I was mistakingly looking in the Cordials section when I should have looked in the Brandy section of the store. Next to the cherry brandys were  Hiram Walker\u2122  Kirshwasser. Oh and another modification: Try using 1 stick (8 TBS) butter to 4 cups powdered sugar. It should take about 2-3 tbs. liquid to get to the right consistency. I find the original recipe is wayyy too sweet and doesn't produce enough buttercream.",

One thing I noticed is that the leftovers a day or two later seemed to taste even better with the cake being extra moist and all soaked through. The whipped cream topping keeps OK too but for the best taste I would suggest putting the entire cake together a day or so in advance of when you will be using it (to give plenty of time for the layers to soak through) and then just frost with whipped cream right before serving. I also found it necessary to chill the coffee icing before use to thicken it.",

For the unsweetened cocoa powder he used Hershey's Special Dark (unsweetened) Cocoa. He used the cherry juice from the canned cherries instead of the kirschwasser. After reading the reviews he used only 2 cups of confectioners' sugar and still added about a teaspoon of cherry juice to make it spread easier. He made three 8 inch layers instead of cutting the two into 4 layers (he just cooked them for less time). He cut the cherries in half to put between the layers and to decorate the top of the cake. He added the 2 tablespoons of dry milk while whipping the heavy whipping cream to stabilize it as recommended earlier and the frosting looked great on the cake the next day. At first he wanted to add sugar to the whipping cream to make it sweeter but he decided not to. After tasting the cake the next day he said the less sweet frosting complimented the sweet cake very nicely--he was glad he didn't add it! The cake came out nice and moist and the tastes blended beautifully after letting it sit over night in the refrigerator. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

It is misleading and this cake is a perfect example. I followed the recipe to the 't' and was very disappointed. My husband took a bite and could not continue eating it. I have never seen him do that in all of our years together. The Kirsh is waayyyy too strong and overpowers everything. The outside 'frosting' is not good at all and just has no taste except for the alcohol. This was really not what we were looking for. This cake took forever to make especially with cutting the 2 cakes into half and I am just so put out with the results...not to mention that after making a special trip to the store to purchase all of the ingredients it nearly broke the bank. I lived in Germany for many years and this is not authentic. I normally don't pay attention to the negative reviews but I should have on this one.",

I also added one tbsp of coffee. The texture of the filling was absolutely fine and i had no problems with it. however i think the next time i will double the amount of ingredients used as the filling was hardly enough to cover all 3 layers. I used cherry rum instead of Kirsch and soaked the cake overnight like some ppl said but i could actually hardly taste the alcohol at all. I'd suppose it is probably bcos it's not Kirsch. I also added about 1/2 cup of sugar to the whipping cream. ALl in all the cake was not too sweet and it has a very good presentation!! Also for those who cannot cut cakes into half try using a thread and wrap it around the cake circumference. Pull it towards you and ta-da! a beautifully cut cake with no crumbs or uneven sides!",

So I just made a 2 layer cake. I only used 2 cups of confection sugar. For the cherry filling I used one can of cherry pie filling. I used Kaluha instead of the coffee. To garnish I grated a square of chocolate over the top of the whipping cream then placed Kirch soaked maraschino cherries around the edge of the cake a 4 in the middle. It was not only beautiful it was Delicious and the hit of the birthday party! Thanks for submitting...",
