The time to bake these was not mentioned so I used a stopwatch and did 2 batches of them at 14 min. and the final batch at 13 min. Both batches came out great. I wouldn't bake them any longer than 14 min. These are also good dipped in milk after they have cooled.",

I substituted margarine for the shortening and omitted the butter extract because I didn't have those ingredients. Also just for an extra treat I added 1/2 cup of raisins (saw that in another cornbread cookie recipe here). My cooking time was 12 minutes (my oven is a bit on the hot side). The cookies came out nicely browned on the bottom and edges. The yield was 33 nicely-sized cookies. Next time I'm going to double the recipe because I don't think this batch will last more than a day. Again an excellent recipe... thanks for sharing!",

A slight crunch in texture is the unexpected and delightful addition to regular cookies. These are great plain and with raisins and I bet chocolate chips would go very well too. I did make a substitution as I didn't have shortening so I used butter. Gave them a bit of a butter/shortbread cookie feel. Instead of butter flavoring which I also didn't have and figured was unnecessary due to my previous substitution I added a bit of extra vanilla extract. Baking for 13 minutes was perfect as the edges were golden the bottoms were slightly crispy and the center was soft. I am definitely making these again - they were also a huge hit with my husband who is normally able to resist sweets.",

(that's what I had on hand) The recipe made 29 cookies using a level 1oz. cookie scoop. Cooked 6 min. rotated the pans & then cooked 7 min. more. Perfect! Make sure to cool the cookies on the sheet pan a bit otherwise they will fall apart on you. Hubby was skeptical about tasting these because he doesn't care for corn muffins but he had to stop himself after the 4th one. This is a keeper and will be making again. Thanks",
