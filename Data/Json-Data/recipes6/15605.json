It's also helpful to chill the cream cheese really well before topping w/ the jello.  Sometimes I like to add an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple in w/ the strawberries (Paula Deen's version)",

Thru my experience, this is what I did and didnt seem to have a problem with any of the layers seeping thru.  FIRST-COOL THE CRUST COMPLETELY!!  SECOND-CREAM THE SUGAR AND CREAM CHEESE THOROUGHLY!  SPREAD ON PRETZEL MIXTURE AND REFRIGERATE AT LEAST 30-45 MINUTES.  PREPARE JELLO AS DIRECTED BY DISSOLVING COMPLETELY FOR TWO MINUTES  AND ADD FROZEN, SLICED STRAWBERRIES.  LET SIT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES STIRRING FREQUENTLY DURING THOSE FIVE MINUTES UNTIL IT IS LIKE A JELLIED, SOFT TEXTURE.  I USED A METAL WHISK TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. POUR OVER REFRIGERATED CREAM CHEESE LAYER.  REFRIGERATE UNTIL SET, ABOUT A COUPLE OF HOURS.  HOPE THIS HELPS!!!!",

I did follow other reviewer's suggestions and chill the layers in-between layering. Made for an easier time of layering. I also made sure to go right to the edges with the cream cheese layer to keep from the jello layer from seeping through and making the \"crust\" soggy. Fun! EDITED NEXT DAY: I LOVED the top and bottom layers. They were wonderful together. The bottom layer was.....just not right for this dessert. If I were to make this again, I'd double a recipe for graham cracker crust and use that instead of the pretzels. It just wasn't good. EDITED AGAIN A WEEK LATER: I made this again today with a crust made from Lorna Doone cookies. I just followed the same recipe, only using two sleeves of crushed Lorna Doone cookies. Much better.\nEDITED YET AGAIN: I made the top layer today with Blackberry Fusion Jello and this summer's blackberries. Fabulous. Not as overpoweringly sweet as the strawberries.",
