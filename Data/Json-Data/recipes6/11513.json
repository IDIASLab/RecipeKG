This one sounded great because it was so simple, yet it gave precise mixing directions -- and I wasn't disappointed! The cake was quite moist and tender, due to the addition of the whipped whites at the end. My guests were very pleased with the velvety texture and smooth, natural orange flavor. I used the \n\"Simply Orange\" brand for my orange juice, and I used a tad more than 2 tbs orange zest. Also, I paired it with cream cheese buttercream, which complemented the orange fantastically. If you like your cakes on the sugar side, or if you prefer very light, airy cakes, this one may not be the recipe for you. If you like moist, tender, subtle cakes, you've found your recipe!",

One thing for those cupcake makers to take note though: they don't rise much so you would probably like to fill it more than 2/3.",
