I fried my bacon.Boiled 8 large potatoes frozen ears of corn I put into steamer basket above my boiling potatoes. Cut the corn off the ears drained my potatoes. I put two tablesppons of butter mashed it all up. Then I had a jar of Ragu roasted garlic parmesan sauce put that in with my potatoes with some can milk. My last onion was gone so I used onion powder. Put some bacon grease in my soup dumped the corn in with some basil leaves. it was still a little thick like mashed potatoes so I added water salt and pepper served with some italian herb bread! Superb if I may say so. With bacon and cheese also on top. I still gonna try with the other ingredients I didn't have.",
