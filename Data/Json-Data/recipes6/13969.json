(And we are in Texas so we have TUBS to choose from). I also added a large amount of ready to use minced garlic. Next time I'm going to drain the stewed tomatoes and cut back on the sugar. A dash of lime juice might be nice also. I did use extra fine sugar so that it would disolve quickly. It made a huge amount for a small price from ingredients I keep in the pantry. I also suspect that this is how Mexican restaurants churn out gallons of salsa every day. It was that good! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. No more canned salsa for us!!",

A little better but even so the celery dominated. Way too much celery! I'm glad that I halved this recipe b/c it yielded a ton! (Btw 1/2 recipe filled 2 Naturally Fresh salad dressing jars.) If I were to make this recipe again I would drastically scale back the celery and add way more seasoning but more than likely I will be trying a different recipe out instead. Thanks anyhow!",
