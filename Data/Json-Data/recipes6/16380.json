Having said that though if you want a traditional quiche look for another quiche recipe. The cottage cheese gives this a moister consistency than a regular quiche. It's nice I like it. I didn't have the veggies called for but I did have some frozen spinach so I added that along with diced potatoes. If I'd have thought about it I would have added some diced tomatoes as well.
