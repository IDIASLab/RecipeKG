They turned out great!!! I served it with salad and a side of buttered/garlic noodles...and it is now the meal I take to friends. Very good.",

I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into 3-4 pieces and pound them out really thin salt & pepper them dredge in flour then beaten egg and then in the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture. Fry them up in 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil till golden brown! Don't over cook them or the meat gets really dry. If you do this one right the outside is very crispy & crunchy with a moist juicy tender inside. One of my families favorite summertime comfort foods hands down! Serve with a chilled creamy potato salad and corn on the cob YUM! The ultimate comfort food!",

Rather than a 350 degree oven I baked them at 400 degrees 20-25 minutes depending on the size of the chicken breasts. Moist and juicy fork tender with incredible fresh herb flavor. Darned pretty too.
