I didn't have lemon zest so left it out but I don't think it made a big difference. It was just fine without. Next time I have a lot of extra plums I'll make it again. And maybe even try other fruit. The clafouti is a kind of doughy custard which may not sound appetizing but don't let that put you off. This really is good.",

I liked that it wasn't too sweet and had a texture similar to creme caramel which is a favourite. What made it really good was topping it with a plum sauce my husband made with our remaining fruit. He cooked pitted plums down with a bit of water and then sweetened it to taste. Served warm it was divine. I actually made it again the next day to see if it was that good and it was. I am going to try this recipe using apples brown sugar and a caramel sauce. Stay tuned.",

I don't usually have lemon zest around so I leave that (and the salt) out and use only 4 tbl sugar total and often substitute wholewheat or buckwheat or soy for half the flour and it's always wonderful. Looking forward to trying it with herb-infused milk this year. Maybe rosemary. Thanks Marion!",
