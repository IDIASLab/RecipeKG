I didn't have any on hand so after the first batch I added about a cup of semisweet mini chocolate chips and it made a huge difference--the cookies went from just good to absolutely delicious. The dough was very soft and sticky so I put them in the fridge for about 15 minutes and then baked them for 13 minutes--perfect!! Will definitely make again.",

I know that the author was trying to infuse the \"peanuty\" flavour by melting the peanut butter chips into the dough but what I found worked much better is melting 1/2 a cup of actual peanut butter in with the chocolate and mixing in the peanut butter chips whole. This creates a great peanuty flavour and texture. Hope this helps.",
