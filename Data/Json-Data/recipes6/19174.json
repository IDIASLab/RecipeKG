I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce (rather than 1/3) and chinese red vinegar in place of the black.   Used chopped vidalia onion instead of green, which i lacked. Am eating it now and liking it much! Note: Do not omit chinese-style vinegars, which impart a particularly delightful flavor! (I did not have sesame oil today when i made this dish again so i toasted some sesame seeds and added them to soy sauce mixture--worked well).",

What I did find is black bean sauce so I added that in. It took alot longer than 10 minutes for my tofu to brown I was starting to get worried. But eventually it did anyway the end result seemed way too salty. I don't know if its my beginner skills and me taking 'seasoning' too far or because I used 1/3 of dark soy sauce instead of normal stuff. Anyway (this may sound a little strange) when I lick the sauce it's nice but then when I chew and shallow the tofu it really is too salty for me. I think I shall make some rice tomorrow and hopefully the sauce will immerse into that and become weaker (less salty). Otherwise the green onions and garlic smelt so yummy! Also the tofu when it started browning looked really yum too. I think my results was probably influenced more on my tastebuds and skills than the recipe. I may try this again in the future with a few adjustments (e.g. less salt and less soy sauce)",

I fried the tofu for about 15 minutes before adding the garlic because I wanted to tofu crispy without burning the garlic. The leftovers the next day actually tasted better and the tofu was less salty and more mellow in taste. Next time I'll let it sit in the fridge for a day for the tofu to take on the marinade sauce.
