The flavor is much more intense. For frosting beat 8oz. cream cheese with 1 c. powder sugar and another 1c. puree peaches. Fold in 8 oz. whip topping. I split my 2 9\" layers and frosted in between layers than stacked and frosted top and sides of cake. The fosting is light and not overly sweet. It made for a really high cake. I drizzled with caramel and chopped pecans. Next time I would use almonds as peaches and almonds blend well! You can use other canned fruit like apricots.",
