My changes were: one diced apple instead of daikon radish, red onion instead of leek, water instead of stock (I was out of stock, but I figured the intense flavours could stand on their own), a mixture of wild rice, quinoa and millet (so simmered only 25 minutes), added 1 tsp of turmeric, omitted curry paste (couldn't find), spinach/spring mix instead of collards, and threw in a handful of frozen peas at the end. I also baked the squash rather than nuked it (350 degrees, 1/2 hour face down, sprinkle with butter and salt first), and added the spices to the veggie saut\u00e9 a couple minutes before adding the rice and water, not after it was cooked (spices should be cooked in fat to wake up the flavours). One of my squashes turned out to be bad so I'm going to add some potato and cauliflower to the leftovers, it will make a fine curry dish. My only critique is that it needs salt, unless, I suppose, your stock is salted, which could be why the author didn't add salt to the recipe.",

My acorn squash was pretty large so I cut it in 4 and placed flesh down in a microwave safe roasting dish covered with plastic so it took a little less time. It needed a little salt next time I will add it before serving. The curry and red curry paste make the dish. The feta cheese was a great addition on top. Definitely jazzed up the acorn squash!",
