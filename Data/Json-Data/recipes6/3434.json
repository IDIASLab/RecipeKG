I used an everyday lager and you'd never guess there was beer in the sauce, which is a good thing in my opinion!  I definitely wouldn't make this with an IPA or a stout, but that's personal preference.   I have to admit my first taste caught me off guard and I thought it was too sweet, but I added some salt and the more I ate it, the more I became addicted!  To thicken the sauce at the end, I sprinkled in a tiny bit of the leftover seasoned flour used to dredge the chops. The chops I used were nice and thick, about 1\". I browned 3-4 minutes per side, and simmered in the sauce for 10 minutes and they were done perfectly. Nice and juicy and not overcooked and dry.",

At first, I thought it might be all that rosemary.  Nope -- it was the IPA.  Having reduced the liquid as directed, all the hops in the IPA became concentrated, making for a very bitter sauce.  I will make this again, but I'll use a milder beer like PBR or maybe a brown ale.",

I like this recipe because it was easy to put together tasted good and I could put the chops on hold while the veggies cooked then finish the sauce when the veggies were about done.
