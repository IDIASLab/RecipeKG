We have baked them many times before using another recipe that I am unable to locate at this time. We followed this recipe to the word - and it turned out lousy. The Whiskers do not look like whiskers ( as they really should ) they look more like a busted lip and are as flat as can be. The real Santa's Whiskers should remain in a clump ( if you will ) and not flatten out as they cook. These ended up very thin and flat and burnt on the edges...and the taste is not the desired taste as we hope dit would be. I'll look harder for my old recipe that is in a box somewhere from moving this past summer. Thanks",

I do tend to add a little less pecan and cherry (1/2 cup pecan and 3/4 cherries.) These are crisp and delicious butter cookies but the cherries and coconut give them a nice chewiness. It bums me out to see the one other negative review when the cook was obvioulsy just looking for a completely different kind of cookie. These are Santa's Whiskers I've always known them and I encourage you to try them if you're loking for a simple festive and not-to-sweet butter cookie.",
