Of course they were more like \"chewy gooey honeycakes.\" I just didn't enjoy the texture which I felt was undercooked. The flavor was just the right mix of honey and spices but far too sweet. Perhaps less granulated sugar and more cooking time? I don't know if we'll try this recipe again especially since it makes so much (tight fit in the mixing bowl!) and is difficult to halve.",
