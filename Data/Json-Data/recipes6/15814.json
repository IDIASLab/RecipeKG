A good way to cook eggplant. I served it w/gnocci (potato pasta). My husband liked it I thought the seasonings were off - and I love all those in the receipe. We had left overs so the next day made Couscous and made a veggi burrito w/the stew cheese couscous and Louisiana hot sauce - Now THAT was GOOD!!!! A good very healthy receipe but you'll probably need to make little changes for it to suit your taste.",
