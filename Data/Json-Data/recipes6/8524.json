This is my version; hearty, thick, and chock full of veggies. It is important to add the diced beets at the end to keep the color appealing. My daughter goes crazy for this soup; it is very tasty and filling, best served warm.",

                "reviewBody": "Instant Pot Update (made in 8 quart): Put barley onion soup bay leaf water and oxtail in instant pot. Cook 40 minutes on soup/stew setting natural release. Remove oxtail and separate / shred meat. Add remaining veggies and shredded meat to instant pot cook 5 minutes on soup / stew setting natural release. The difference between the two methods in the instant pot: the meat doesn't separate as easily the barley is much softer the color of the soup is not as vibrant. Both methods are flavorful and the veggies are cooked.....Alternate method for slow cooker soup: you can also cook the diced beets separately by boiling in water. Add at end because the barley will drain the color of the beets. My daughters favorite! The soup (without the sour cream) freezes well. I dice the beets to cook faster if you want larger beets cook separately and add at end to soup. No beet tops add chopped Swiss chard. You may have to add more seasoning (salt pepper onion soup) depending on amount of water added.",
