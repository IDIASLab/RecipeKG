Like others, I added 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1 t. vanilla extract, split the sugar in to 1/2 c. of white and brown sugar, and I used 1 c. of all purpose flour with 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  I also cut the butter in half and substituted with applesauce.  Sometimes making these healthier cuts into your baking also means you have to cut out on the taste, but this proportion worked perfectly!  A little bit healthier and it was gone before it was finished cooling on the cooling rack!  I guess I better make some more...",

Because I love anything banana flavored, I decided to put in 5 mashed bananas this time and added 1t vanilla, and 1t cinnamon.Because of the dry to wet ratio I added another 1/2c flour and 1t baking powder. A flavorful, moist banana bread was the result! With my modifications, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks, Nikki! :) By the way, for two 7X3 loaves, it took only 45 minutes in my oven. I believe 1 hour would dry the bread out.\r\n",

After my brother in law said \"its soo moist\" he turned to his wife and said \"this is how banana bread is supposed to be\". Also, my 10 year nephew wants me to make him his OWN banana bread.   Like a lot of people, I also added an extra banana (total of 4), 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1 t. vanilla. I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes in a 9x5 loaf pan (I didn't have the size suggested in the recipe). After 40 mins,  I placed a foil tent over the pan and lowered the heat to 250 degrees for approximately 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper!",
