Though I\u2019ve made a number of variations of this recipe probably a hundred times, I still couldn\u2019t believe how easy and quick it was to mix these up.  I prepared the recipe as directed, only adding a teaspoon of vanilla cuz it can\u2019t hurt, right? I also topped it with a delicious homemade cream cheese frosting, Cream Cheese Frosting II, recipe also on this site.  To emphasize how good and satisfying these are, let me say this: Hubs is not fond of either cream cheese or anything pumpkin, yet not only did he try these, his remark of \u201cyum!\u201d spoke volumes.  As this type recipe always is with a cup of oil, they are very moist, and I found this particular recipe to have just the right amount of \u201cspiciness.\u201d  There was a nail-biting moment when it looked as though the bars just might overflow the 15x10\u201d pan, but it apparently knew just the right time to stop, and all was good.  Hubs took these to the office today and this big pan (whoa, it was heavy!) was devoured quickly.  A bonus was that they were attractive to the eye and easy to cut and serve cleanly.  I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make these again, particularly for an occasion where a darn good dessert is needed in a hurry. Note: be sure and check these a good few minutes before the directed baking time.  Mine were done at 27 minutes.",
