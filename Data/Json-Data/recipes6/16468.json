I stayed close to the recipe but added Italian seasoning to the spinach mixture threw in a couple of cloves of garlic and subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese. Used jarred sauce because of time and I par-cooked the noodles instead of cooking them to al dente since they finish cooking in the oven. Additionally no need to spray or grease the pan...just throw a layer of sauce down before putting your rolls in - this prevents them from sticking. I didn't find them to be messy or hard to put together like others had mentioned nor did I think they took all that long to prepare. These will be made again - with Italian sausage being worked in I am sure. Thanks!",
