The 1st batch followed it to a T and my cookies were slightly flat and needed a little something but couldn't put my finger on it. Went back and looked at some other reviews and made the 2nd batch. I took the white sugar decreased it to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 brown sugar. I increased the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 tsp increased the flour to 3 cups and used 12 oz white chips(works out to 1 3/4 cup--one bag) and 6 oz Macadamia baking pieces dry roasted. I didn't see the need to measure out 4 oz---I like nuts so I used the whole bag. With these adjustments I got a nice flavorful cookie as I think was intended and still slightly soft in the middle...I have a gas oven so 8 1/2 to 9 minutes was just perfect. Even though the first batch was decent the 2nd batch was excellent..I couldn't rate this a bad recipe at all just some minor help. Will make this again with the adjustments.",

But I was wrong...I tried to go the 9 min but they were still super raw so I added another 2 min and took them out they had crunchy outsides and raw insides still. Overall they were really yummy I don't know how anyone could call them Better than Sex there is no way a cookie can compare to good lovin' haha. I will try these cookies again and again but I will have to experiment maybe I will take my Nieman Marcus cookie and just add white chips and macadamia nuts...hmmmmmm anyone that has suggestion please put them down for us...maybe the author of the recipe?
