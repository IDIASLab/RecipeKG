        "description": "These are delicate lace cookies with an amazing taste! A tradition in our family for Christmas since I was a little girl. These cookies spread to make a very thin wafer, almost transparent. Super easy to make, but be careful, as they can be quick to burn or cool too much on your cookie sheet - and then you'll be chipping the cookies off of your cookie sheet! I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does. Store in an airtight container until serving.",
