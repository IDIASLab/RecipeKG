I saute'd my onions in the oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. And used a No Corn Syrup ketchup and relacing the sugar with an alternative(Splenda). Worked out great. But stayed true to the recipe. Just modified to suit. I'd make this again in a heartbeat. Nice mild zing to it. You could easily add a few jalapenos to kick this up if you like it spicy. It would work very well. TY sal.",
