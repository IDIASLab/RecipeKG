I just made a batch of these muffins, and my wife and 13 month old son ate half a dozen before they were cool. \n\nA couple things that I did differently:\nI sifted the flour with the dry ingredients - though I still used the larger grains of the flour. \nI used margarine instead of butter.\nI used large eggs and ended up with about 1/2 a cup of egg white from four eggs.\nI used two bananas that were so ripe they were black (never frozen though).  Incidentally, two large bananas were exactly 1.5 cups mashed.\nI very precisely measured all ingredients, though the blueberries were probably a bit more than one cup.  These were fresh, not frozen.\nThe biggest change was that after putting in a spoonful of batter, I put in a teaspoon of blueberry jam.  Then I filled the rest of the muffin cup up to about 80% full.  \nI baked these muffins on the top rack for  20 minutes.\nThey did not rise a lot, but they did rise more than the picture that is posted  with the original recipe.  \nIt made one dozen fantastic, moist, and delicious muffins.\nThis is a recipe that I'll use again and again...\nOh, one more thing.  I let the batter sit for about 20 minutes before I put it in the oven... This was by accident though cause I couldn't find the muffin pans!\n",

I did tweak the recipe some-- (I doubled the recipe) I added a couple egg yoks, a little extra vanila and a whole lot of blueberries.  Then I baked them in mini-muffin pans instead of a cake pan, and baked them a few degrees cooler.  They came out very moist and flavorful.  I think the trick is to pack them full of blueberries.

I also used two whole eggs instead of the 4 egg whites. They were a bit too heavy for my kids due to the fact that these are made with all whole wheat flour. If I make them again I will probably use 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. Overall it is a healthy recipe with close to 1/2 fruit serving in every muffin.
