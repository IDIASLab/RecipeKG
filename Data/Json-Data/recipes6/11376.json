As I took it to my work my co-workers asked what tasty spice it would contain - they couldn't believe it was just burnt sugar. The taste reminded of German Spekulatius. To prevent the crust from tasting bitter you should be careful not to let it get too dark. And one of my co-workers suggested to make the caramel syrup by cooking the sugar with the water from the beginning on as I told her it bubbled up very high when I added the water to the boiling sugar. I would definitely make the cake again and try the suggested caramel procedure. Thanks for the recipe!",
