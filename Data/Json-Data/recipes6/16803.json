The lemon flavor takes over the vanilla which tastes good but something to keep in mind. This recipe makes a decent amount of ice cream so I used the servings calculator and cut the recipe in half. I made the ice cream using the exact amount og ingredients called for except that I cooked the ice cream until thickened because of the eggs in it which I recommend doing. Just combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and whisk together for about 10 minutes or so on medium to medium high heat until slightly thickened and allow mixture to completely cool in the fridge before transferring to your ice cream maker.",
