I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup (but I changed the servings to 36 because I only wanted to use cup of margarine) and I used one very large egg. I omitted the red hots and I glazed the cookies with a glaze consisting of icing sugar and orange juice. My three-year old then went crazy with the Easter-themed sprinkles.:) The orange was a nice change and the lesser amount of sugar made them less sweet enough that my husband (not a fan of sweets) enjoyed.
