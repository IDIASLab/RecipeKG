I made just as directed, no changes what so ever. Yeah it takes awhile to make but this is how good bread is made.  It is the first time in YEARS I have made bread without the machine and I am so glad I took the plunge!!  It's not super sour but I have family members that are really into sour so it is perfect for this household. I have NEVER made bread without yeast, even bread made with a starter and was expecting a flat, dense loaf. What I got was a beautiful, light, fluffy and extremely flavorful bread that the family is already asking me to make more of.  Thank goodness this makes 2 loaves cause the first one was demolished 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven.  Try it, it is amazing and like I said...it may take awhile to make but all good things are worth waiting for. Use Beckys potato starter with this, you won't be sorry!!!",

No matter what, it is worth it!  I used to make this bread, then I got wimpy and started using the bread machine, but now I'm back, because there is no substitute for this bread!  The only suggestions I would make is to let your bread rise both times in a very warm place, and I omit the sifting of the flour (but that's a personal thing I guess).  Your bread will get rave reviews, especially if they can smell it when it's baking and taste it hot out of the oven!!!!",

It is sweeter than I like, not sour at all and honestly quite bland, but makes a great loaf of white sandwich bread from your starter.  I was concerned since it browned awfully fast and tapped hollow at 30 min, so I took it out tested it and and it really needed more time.  Reluctantly, I put it back in for the rest of the time and thankfully it gets very brown but not an overly thick crust.  I am making this again tonight, but will cut the sugar, even more and substitute 3 cups whole wheat.  Tip to those new to bread making, just use a knife to divide into 2 loaves and it is very important to give it a warm place to rise overnight.  The yeast needs that.  Also I let my starter sit out and get to room temperature all day then make the dough at night.  Good Luck!",

I didn't have bread flour, so I simply used allpurpose flour. I also didn't have corn oil, and used vegetable oil instead. It was so light and fluffy and moist. I will say, however, that your bread is only as good as your starter. I used the starter by the same cook, Becky Richardson, that has potato flakes rather than flour. It was WELL worth the wait for this bread! Wonderful for sandwiches as well as toast in the morning. Keep it in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic, or in a plastic zipper bag, and it will keep longer. It doesn't have preservatives, so the shelf life isn't all that long. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!",

I was given another start of it and will be using it again. I have made cinnamon rolls, whole wheat bread by substituting 1-2 cups of Hodgson's Mill Whole Wheat flour for the bread flour, and calazone loaves using ham, cheese, sweet green peppers and onions.

I can't wait to experiment with different loaf shapes. I used olive oil instead of corn oil, and I started in the morning, let it rise all day, then did the second kneading that night, and let it rise overnight and baked it in the morning.
