Though the batter looked okay in the bowl, it was extremely thick and hard to not only get it onto the griddle without really messing with it AND the pancakes didn't want to cook once they were on the griddle. I would try this again but I would use a different pancake batter as the base--this one really didn't work out for me at all.",

I thinned the batter with more milk and the rest cooked up fine. If I make these again, I will leave out the brown sugar. Also, the peanut butter is very strong even though there's only 1/4 cup. I love PB, but I think I would cut back just a little. If this was intended as a dessert pancake, with a little vanilla ice cream I'd give it 5 stars for sure!",
