I halved the recipe since it was only for 1, didn't have tamarind paste so I subbed a little lime juice and fish sauce for the sour. I also didn't have chili paste so I used powder, and I used fresh garlic instead of preferred. I used a gourmet seafood mix and only used mushrooms and snowpeas for the veggies. I loved it. Next time I will make sure to have all the ingredients on hand to give it a more adequate rating. \n\nOh, I also only soaked the noodles for 30 minutes in really hot tap water like the directions on the noodle package called for.",

I used noodles that were already soaked and vacuum packed so I just needed to add them to the stirfry at the end. I marinated about a pound of sliced chicken in some peanut butter rice wine (you could use white wine) soy sauce and brown sugar for a few hours. I cooked the chicken first then added sliced carrots and onions for a few minutes then added bean sprouts and water chestnuts. I pushed everything to one side of my wok and scrambled an egg. Then I tossed in the noodles and the sauce (which I cooked according to this recipe) removed the wok from the stove and continued to toss until everything was combined. I topped with chopped peanuts sliced green onions and lime. YUM! Thank you so much for this incredible sauce recipe.",

I didn't know what to expect when I tasted it but the finished product was really good. Kind of hot though but perhaps I used too much chili pasted. I added an extra two teaspoons of PB and 4 pinches of brown sugar to the finished product. It is pretty authentic. When I make it again I'm going to try to find a way to reduce the oil. I omitted the oil when sauteing the veggies and used water instead.",
