I used two enormous frozen chicken breasts and they were done in less than six hours, so I don't think the cooking time is accurate.  As for the problem with the sauce being watery, I noticed that and solved it by cracking the lid on the crock pot (about 1\" or so) for the last hr. they cooked, turning them once, so the sauce could reduce and carmelize a bit.  They were delicious, but next time I think I'll add more chicken, because there was a lot of sauce.  Served it with garlic butter rice and corn, and it was a big hit with the kids!  I just hope my crock pot comes clean after soaking all day and night.",
