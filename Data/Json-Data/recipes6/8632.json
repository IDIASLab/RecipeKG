        "description": "Velveting is a technique that is usually used for stir-fries, but I decided to try it on pan-fried top sirloin steaks, and my experiment was a great success! The theory behind velveting is that the egg white, cornstarch, and rice wine mixture coats the surface of the meat, locking in moisture and giving it a tender, velvety texture. Top sirloin is lean and doesn't have a lot of fat, but these steaks--thanks to the velveting--were unbelievably juicy! Serve with rice or pasta to soak up the juices.",
