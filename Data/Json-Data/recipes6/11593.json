My mom thought the sauce was a little too sweet, so adjust the sugar by your own taste. Also note that breading and frying the chicken isn't necessary. I just stuck it in the oven and baked it and it tasted great. Try it with rice and carrots, the sauce tastes good on both of those as well.",

I added less than 1/2 a cup of sugar so that fixed the sweetness issue other reviewers had but the sauce didn't have an asian flair to it. That's what I was looking for I guess. I prepared the chicken with garlic and ginger -- thankfully that saved the meal. This is an orange sauce. Plain and simple. If that's what your looking for you've found a good one.
