It made a bland baked chicken dinner special and a little exotic. Since we had the eggs cooked already it took about ten minutes for the bacon and that was it. Also we didn't have water chestnuts so we used macadamia nuts. Yummy!",

You MUST put it in the food processor or else it looks realy disgusting and lumpy. Great recipe!!!!",

I thought it needed a little something else so I added a little fresh minced garlic and cracked black pepper. updated 12/23/07 I still make this but now add dried cranberries or dried cherries add pecans instead of walnuts and make the dressing with the bacon grease instead of oil not heart healthy but WOW!!",
