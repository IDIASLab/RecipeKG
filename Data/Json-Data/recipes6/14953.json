I don't know what happened but the vanilla created like a mini explosion when i put it in the mixture. And then it took at least 20 minutes of beating this mixture before it even began to thicken. Wouldnt recommend this to anyone. Tastes just ok. Nothing amazing. Extremely disappointed. Tastes more like caramel than chocolate. Terrible clean up I had to scrub the thermometer for almost 5 minutes until it even started to come off.",
