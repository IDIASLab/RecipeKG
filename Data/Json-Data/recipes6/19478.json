I did not use the water-- just added enough milk to make a firm biscuit dough. I am guessing some of the difference in texture and height is due to the various amounts of butter and/or milk in the leftover potatoes. Additionally the type of potato may account for different results as some are more starchy than others. My family and I are sold on these biscuits. They were also delicious warmed over the next morning for sausage and egg sandwiches. 10 stars for this recipe!",

I would imagine if you cut the sugar down a tad and added some shredded cheddar and garlic salt they would make good potato cheese biscuits- I'll have to try it next time.",

I didn't want to take the time to roll out the dough so I floured my hands rolled in quick balls flattened and they turned out just wonderful. My mashed potatoes from Sunday had the skins on and that didn't seem to change the biscuits in any way. This is a recipe I will keep and Pass on! I have 3 kids ranging in age from 5 to 11 and they all loved them.",

Not complaining at all (and neither are my kids). One thing to note with this recipe (and all biscuit recipes): essential to keep ingredients cold. The butter needs to be hard straight from the fridge. If it's softened or melted the dough will be too sticky to handle. Use cold water and cold milk and make sure the mashed potatoes are at least room temperature (although the dough will be easier to handle if they've been refrigerated). We ate these with turkey and gravy for lunch on the day after Thanksgiving... couldn't have been better!",
