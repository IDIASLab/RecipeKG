If not completely melted when you remove from oven, simply cover the pan with a cookie sheet to contain the heat and let the chocolate melt, then smooth with a decorating knife.  \n\nAlso, don't cool in the refrigerator.  The candy and the chocolate cool at different rates and will often separate.  If you are experiencing the candy and chocolate coming apart, allow cooling slowly without refrigeration - it won't happen.\n\nAnother tip:  After smoothing the chocolate with a knife creating a nice wavy pattern, drag a toothpick through the chocolate to create even nicer designs or even write in the chocolate.",

I melted the chocolate chips (I used the milk chocolate and added what was left from a bag of dark chocolate probably less than 1/2 c. ) in the same sauce pan used for the brown sugar and butter. As long as one keeps it on a very low temp and stirs it won't burn. Next time I make this I may just sprinkle the chocolate chips on the bars after baking. The heat from the toffee mix will likely melt the chocolate until it can be spread with a spatula. A few months back I tried another recipe very similar to this but I think it called for semi-sweet or dark chocolate and it also had sliced or slivered almonds on top. One could dress up this particular recipe with nuts as well and perhaps a little sea salt.",
