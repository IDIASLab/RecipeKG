I tried to scrape the topping off just to salvage the pie but even then it was still difficult to stomach. I think if I made it again I would leave off the topping(or cut sugar amounts in half) and use 1/4 cup sugar on the apples and 1 cup sugar in the custard. I'm wanting to give the recipe 2 stars but feel that the pie would be really good if the sugar wasn't such a problem.",
