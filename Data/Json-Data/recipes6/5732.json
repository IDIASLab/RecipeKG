Go slow tho because it takes a little bit for the flakes to work. Thickens without adding a lot of calories. This soup is very tasty but I can't say I added the cumin. That idea didn't appeal after I tasted a spoon of the soup with a little cumin added. Used parsley and a bit of Mrs. Dash. Very nice.",
