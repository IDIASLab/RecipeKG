Bit of advice I have a similar recipe that is made in a 9 X 13 pan with the additions of nuts on the bottom if you make this it must be made very late at night or when u get up to cook them they will have risen to much. The pudding makes these like a caramel sticky bun. Mine does not call for any milk but the finished product is almost identical. I made mine early afternoon for a bed time snack. I should have got them in the oven about an hr earlier. Very easy to put together thanks for sharing it was great!",

                "reviewBody": "Tasty and easy but you definitely need some additional guidance on prep - you really need to spray or oil/flour the pan before adding the frozen rolls. I like this recipe since it calls for cook and serve pudding much tastier than instant and the yeast rolls are so much better than using tube biscuits. If you use butter instead of margarine it will burn so margarine is best. Once you add the rolls put plastic wrap on top and keep the pan on top of a larger plate or pan since the rolls do rise quite a bit and have potential to overflow a bit taking some of the ingredients with it. After it has risen you'll probably have to punch it down a bit before adding the milk otherwise it will go all over the counter and then your oven.",

As the bread rises all of the dry cinnamon sugar and pudding mix falls out of the pan. Then the instructions tell you to pour milk on top which is not an easy task and only caused the dry mix to fall out again. Despite all of the preparation issues we proceeded to cook the bread and thank goodness we placed it on top of a cookie sheet because none of the bread stayed inside the pan. It was a mess! I have made monkey bread before with other recipes and never had this issue. When it is edible it is delicious!",

Made it in my silicon pan and all 36 frozen rolls fit...now overnight is different for everyone..i happen to sleep 6 hours..it was perfect. They were fine. I like the monkey bread recipe with the biscuits cut in fourths...rolled in cinnamon and sugar..put in pan and then butter brown sugar and milk is boiled and poured over and baked...the cinnamon/sugar flavor is more even and the caramel flavor it that great home made taste. The problem is I don't like the taste of the canned biscuits.I think the butterscotch pudding didn't come close. I am going to try my recipe with the cut up bread dough and I am thinking it will be the perfect monkey bread. thanks for the recipe we ate it all....",
