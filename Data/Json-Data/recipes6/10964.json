You can easily cut down on up to 1/2 the oil, and about 1/4 of the sugar if you want.  You can also replace 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar or bakable splenda.  Yes, the cake get's alittle mushy after 24 hours, but really does it last that long at your house?  Not mine!  Finally, why are we peeling the apples?  Unless you really don't like \"crunchy\" or just plain don't like apples, leave the skin on.  It brings a whole new depth to the dish.  Plus, you will get the health benefits!  Give it a try.  The cake is awesome.",

As I was mixing, the batter was dry so I added milk.  I added milk until the consistency was 'cake-batter-ish).  I baked for 20 minutes then added a streusel topping I made (1/4 C Sugar, 1/4 C Flour, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 3 tbsp of butter).  Baked for another 20 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  It's wonderful!!!!!",

For my own personal taste I usually add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon as well as 1 Cup of chopped pecans or walnuts. Raisins are also a nice addition. I usually use about 1/2 cup. The dough will be very stiff and require mixing by hand with a heavy duty wooden spoon. You can use a 9 X 13 greased and floured pan or a 10-12 Cup Bundt Pan. If using a bundt pan bake at 350 degrees for 55 to 65 minutes or until the cake tests done using a toothpick or cake tester inserted about 2 inches from the edge. Tester should come out clean (free of dough). Also if using a bundt pan you will have to scoop dough from bowl and pack it evenly into cake pan. This is easy to do if you wet your hands first.",
