Also, my oven baked this in more like an hour not the hour & half or more that the recipe called for.  However, I got 3 loaves out of this instead of 2 (..even though I measured my pans and made sure they were 9x5); so if you used bigger loaf pans and got only 2 loaves you might need the extra baking time. Also, mine came out a little crumbly and dry.  Maybe it needs more butter or eggs ???",

I used \u00a0SLICED Almonds vs. slivered. \u00a0I toasted them on the stove before adding to the final batter. The sliced vs slivered gave the bread a more delicate texture. \u00a0 I also used half dried Cranberries along with half sliced Maraschino Cherries in a jar, \u00a0 and omitted the Dates. The tartness of the cranberry vs. the sweet cherry gave a nice interchange of variety to the palate. \u00a0I also increased the salt a bit and used half whole milk unflavored yogurt and half milk instead of buttermilk, \u00a0which gave a little more fat for satiety sake. \u00a0 Of course, I added vanilla to meld all the flavors together, \u00a0as well as the recommended reserved cherry liquor which hued \u00a0as a \u00a0delicate pink shade after baking. \u00a0Brilliant suggestion from Lovesmurf posting.  I highly recommend waiting to serve for a day or more while keeping it wrapped in plastic, thus ensuring an equalizing of \u00a0moisture from the fruit ingredients. \u00a0 I received raves from all who partook. \u00a0P.S. \u00a0I think milk chocolate chips or chunks would work well too.",

We liked the bread but felt I could have decreased the amount of chocolate chips by 1/2 that it calls for. Loved the fact of mixing the milk baking soda vanilla and juice from the maraschino cherries together....what a neat science trick in the kitchen to show my youngest when it grew and foamed up. She thought that was pretty amazing. I will make again but would totally decrease the chocolate chips. Not that I don't love chocolate but the amount with all the other additions was so chunky that in spots where the chips settled the bread fell apart and hands were covered in chocolate. Tastes great with a pat of butter smeared on to the slices when served. TY Another note I used 3 smaller loaf pans. But will note don't use large loaf pans...the batter wont' bake all the way through and will burn on the outside before it gets completely done. Smaller loaf pans and or muffin tins are better.",
