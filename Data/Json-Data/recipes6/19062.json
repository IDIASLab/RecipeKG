First, I used fresh peaches from my boss's peach tree - some of them were quite under-ripe -  and the recipe still came out very sweet.  I will definitely make this again, but I will use a bit less sugar in the fruit and in the topping.  Second, while the topping is super tasty (if a bit sweet), there's not enough of it!  It doesn't need to be doubled but maybe 50% more topping would be great.",

Researching this in my mother's old recipe files, I found something interesting. This recipe is almost identical to hers, but steps 3 and 4 would be changed as follows: Combine 1 and one-half cups each of flour, sugar and milk. Pour this over the peach mixture. Sprinkle with sugar, with or without the cinnamon, and then dot with butter. Bake approx. 30 minutes.\n\nI tried this recipe both ways, and my mother's way is an improvement. It is also easier, by the way.",

I made it with fresh peaches that were about to spoil in a day or two, so I ended up using all I had. This meant that I almost doubled the suggested amount of fruit, and even though I did not double the other ingredients, the recipe came out very well and I had none left over. So be generous with the fruit if you can!!  Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream. Also, consider using other fresh fruits if peaches are not yet in season.  I've made this with mangoes, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and each time the results have been fantastic.",

I tried boiling the peaches to peel them, as suggested, but that didn't quite work out. Instead, I just peeled them with a knife, which worked out just fine and wasn't a hassle at all. When choosing peaches, be sure that they do not have any green on the skin -- this means the fruit hadn't developed before being picked, and it won't get any sweeter afterwards. The crust is unbelievable. When you pour in the boiling hot water, it immediately puffs up into a thick dough. This bakes into a thick, crumb-cake-like topping. The sugar amounts can be adjusted as desired. I found it to be just right. It is incredible with a scoop of vanilla or butter pecan ice cream (or both). My \"southern\" gentleman companion, who has had his share of peach cobblers, really enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I live in the south and I don't know why this would be called southern peach cobbler. It was way to dry my family added cream to it just because it was to dry, and didn't have much of a taste. I followed the recipe as stated. I think next time I will be sticking to my old peach cobbler recipe.",
