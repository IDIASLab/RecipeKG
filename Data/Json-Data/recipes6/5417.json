Wanted to try a different recipe instead of true southern style I\u2019ve always had, and this was perfect. Nice subtle flavor, probably depends heavily on what broth you use.\nI ended up using a bit more ingredients as my bundle was pretty big. Also, if you are a collard n00b like me I highly recommend taking a sec to gooogle how to properly trim them.",
