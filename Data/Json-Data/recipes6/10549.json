I made the bao using seitan (cut up very finely and marinaded overnight) as a substitute for the pork- and he nearly polished off all 12 bao that I made! =) I also cheated and used a store bought flour recipe- which actually turned out really well. You can find it at most Asian food stores. The brand I used was 'D and D Gold product' on the front, in addition to some pics. of bao, it says, 'Bot Lam Bahn Bao Saigon', in big letters. =) With the premixed flour, it only took me about 2 hours once I had the dough mixed to make the bao. (20 minutes to cook each round of 4 bao) I'm sooo happy! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!",

I had leftover frozen fresh ham from our Christmas dinner which when I sauteed it with the shrimp used Hoisen Sauce. I absolutely love that stuff. The buns were incredible however because I don't remember what I did last time I should have sprayed the waxed paper with PAM because they really stuck. I had to reseal them which of course was not so fun. Anyway these babies were so incredible and once more I thank you Carol for a tremendous asian dinner tonight!!!!",

Do not use bread flour; even with the AP suggested it was more glutinous/chewy than I'd like though that might be because I only had bread machine (fast rise) yeast! I skipped the first dough step as per the yeast directions and just mixed everything all the ingredients from step 1 AND step 2 together at once before leaving it for 3 hours in microwave. This worked fine. Left filling mixed overnight in the fridge. I subbed ordinary onions for shallots which wasn't good - the almost-raw onions caused indigestion. Could use green onions. Cooked with a saucepan and steamer set doesn't have to be a wok. Do 15 minutes at most or they get chewy. Very good flavour dough texture was a tad off but it'll be our recipe...for when we have lots of time haha. Oh the filling is very sweet which is how I like it but if you want more savoury just be sure to use a sweetish BBQ sauce and then leave out the white sugar entirely.",

I placed the seam side down onto the wax paper and at first they didn't look too great but by the time it came to steam them they were all smoothed out. Came out fluffy moist and delicious. A bit time consuming but worth it. I made a bit of a bigger bun and it made 12. I didn't use the bbq pork recipe and instead picked up 1/2 lb of char siu and I asked for extra sauce. Just chopped it up and mixed with the sauce and stuffed the buns with it. The only bummer is they aren't so good when reheated in the microwave a day later and I even did the damp paper towel trick.",
