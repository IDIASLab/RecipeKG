I think next time I might try some peanut butter instead of all the oil. You definately must mix these in a dishpan! I am sure the amount of cookies is wrong as I used a 1/4 c. to scoop the dough and ended up with 5 doz monster sized cookies that did disappear quickly.",

We love butterscotch chips and coconut in one chocolate chip chips and pecans in another Reese's peanut pieces in another and from there I just use my imagination. My kids always thought they were different recipes. They had had no idea it was always the basic dishpan recipe. M & Ms White chocolate craisins raisins and nuts.... They are all really good options to mix & match with.",
