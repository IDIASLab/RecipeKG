I was able to break it apart into individual pretzels - and it still tastes good, it's just a mess.  \n\nIf I made it again, I'd use a candy thermometer so that the caramel hardens into toffee.

I put the still hot cookie sheet on a towel in the fridge for an hour but the chocolate was still soft so I put it in the freezer for an hour. Absolutely delucious. Thank you for the grest recipe.

I cooked the caramel for 3 minutes (from a different recipe). The caramel is still a little gooey so I will definitely cook longer next time. I tried to spread the caramel before baking but after taking them out of the oven realized that was a waste because it bubbles up and spreads on its own. I used semi-sweet chocolate and spread with silicone spatula after removing from oven after 1 minute. Then I forgot the sea salt but didn't really miss it. The taste is amazing.
