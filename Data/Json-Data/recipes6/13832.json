It was missing something. Also it is more than crumbly when you mix it I had to use pieces and push it into the pie crust - it would not roll at all it just fell apart......consider using a VERY high quality oil and flour as this is what people will taste. Berry mix inside the pie was non-interesting although it held together nicely. I would recommend adding more sugar or trying to make the crust with butter and sugar which I plan to try after I've picked more berries - all and all - if you have a FREE supply of berries to waste then try this recipe otherwise just make a pie crust and save yourself the disappointment.",

The crust would have been crumbly if I hadn't added more water....I know some pple feel that you can't adjust baking recipes but flour takes on the humidity of an area so you have to be able to adjust. So I did. The crust is basic and it tastes fine. It's not very flaky though so bear that in mind. I added some flour to the filling so it would firm up a bit. Worked great. I really like the taste of this pie. Thanks for the recipe!",
