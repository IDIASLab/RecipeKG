Though the overwhelming majority, of which I am now a part, liked this cake very much I understand that you learn a lot more about something by learning what people did not like about it. So, after having made the cake I have a few suggestions for those who didn\u2019t like the cake. Most of the complaints where that the cake was too heavy or that it was too moist or \u201cpudding like\u201d A solution to this might be to strain the carrots and pineapple more before adding them in to the cake batter. I know the recipe doesn\u2019t specify but I strained the carrots and the pineapple until they where almost dry and added about 2 \u2013 3 tablespoons of the strained liquid back in. I also hydrated the raisins a bit by letting them sit in a cup of warm water while the carrots sat in the brown sugar. Also I made 3 - 8\u201d rounds instead of the recommended 2 - 10\u201d rounds. This will shorten the bake time to about 30 -45 mins. and may also help solve any underdone cake problems\u2026 I thought this cake was very good and well worth the effort. Everyone I have served this to has loved this and I certainly plan on making it again.",

                "reviewBody": "2009 edit: Use cheesecloth to strain the carrots! Wrap 1/3 the carrots in a cheesecloth pouch, twist it shut and squeeze.\n\n I've finally figured out how to make this moist without sogginess. My family loves carrot cake so I\u2019ve made this recipe many times since I first found it. First, do what you can the night before and store ingredients in ziplock bags/tupperware. Grate the carrots, strain the pineapple, sift the dry ingredients, etc. The only things I added: 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves, added 1.5x the vanilla and cinnamon, \u00bd tsp baking POWDER, and the zest of one lemon. I nuked the raisins in equal parts of the drained pineapple juices and rum. The raisins absorbed most of the liquids and were really plump and delicious. Save a few tablespoons to add to the cake. I didn\u2019t want to risk a dry cake so I compromised. I drained the carrots BEFORE I added the brown sugar. After the carrots sit for an hour, there will still be some liquid; add all of it. My cake ended up moist, flavorful, and TALL. Don't over-mix or let your cake sit too long. Baking soda reacts immediately so if you over-mix or leave it around, the gas will escape and your cake will be flat. Use the good pans. Line the bottom of your layer pans with wax paper or parchment paper. Better safe than sorry!  To make a bundt, bake at 325 for 75-90 minutes. Use a cream cheese glaze: beat 4oz cream cheese with 2tsp vanilla and 2c powdered sugar. And 1-2tbsp milk/rum to get spreading consistency.",

It is as follows 1/4 lb. soft butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 lb. confectioners sugar.\r\nCombine butter, cream cheese and vanilla, mix till blended.  Add sugar and mix til smooth.

I used 2 9\" baking pans and it made a pretty regular sized cake.  \r\nI used about 4 cups grated carrots, which was all of the carrots in the bag I bought and 1/2 cup less than called for.  I replaced half of the oil with apple sauce and I replaced half of the pineapple with apple sauce.  I also used wheat flour for a little less than 1/2 of the flour.  I left out the raisins and I added about a tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, ginger and dried orange rind.  I also doubled the cinnamon.  \r\nFor the frosting I used 1/4 lb butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 lb sifted conf sugar.  Should probably have refrigerated it to let it set more before I transported it because it got a little slippy but not disastrous.\r\nI took it to a 4 person dinner party and brought leftovers to work.  People could not get enough.  I was pretty happy since I not only never made carrot cake before, I had never eaten it so I wasn't sure how it should taste!  Thanks!",

Used 5 c. carrots (I used my food processor)4.Added lots of Allspice and nutmeg. I think I added about 1/2 cup extra of flour because the batter looked a little too runny.

                "reviewBody": "I just have to say I initially signed up to review this recipe! It really is the best carrot cake ever! I made this cake on a Sunday afternoon and it was gone by Tuesday morning! Everyone loved it!! The only things i did differently was i strained the carrots  before putting it with the brown sugar also i strained all the juice from the pineapple reserving about 3 tbs for the cake mix! I also hydrated the raisins in warm water for about 45mins. I made a lemon cream cheese for the middle and topping and decorated with chopped walnuts and bits of lemon zest! Yummy!",
