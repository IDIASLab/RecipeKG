I saut\u00e9ed the onion added the water corn potatoes salt pepper and some milk. I made a slurry out of the flour and the remaining milk which I later added to the chowder. After adding the slurry to the chowder and letting it incorporate I tasted the chowder and it was bland. I decided to add a 1/2 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder plus 1/8 tsp dried chives. This improved and gave it some flavor. It still lacked the depth I wanted so I added 3 ounces cream cheese and 1/3 cup grated sharp cheddar. Yes my changes don't reflect the recipe as originally posted but they were an improvement to an otherwise 2 star recipe.",
