                "reviewBody": "Recipe Group Selection:  09, March 2013 ~ I made this for my guys, knowing I would not be trying it.  I used 1 pound of round steak and 1 pound of venison.  I also had to sub green peppers for the mushrooms as they don\u2019t care for them and omitted the raisins for the same reason.  I have never used lard before; therefore I didn\u2019t have any so I used olive oil instead.  So, I made the Steak and Irish Stout Pie using the above ingredients, plus the rest listed and the guys LOVED it!  They took one bite and said, \u201cGive this one 5-stars\u201d.  Because of the length of time it takes to prepare this recipe, I did all the browning and baking of the meats on one night, cooled and refrigerated the dish over night.  The next night, I heated the filling and proceeded with the recipe.  sassyoldlady, another AR member sent out a reminder about piercing the bottom crust when pre-baking it.  That was so helpful, as I would not have done that because the instructions didn\u2019t tell me to do so.  I pre-baked the crust, add the filling, minus some of the broth and added the top crust.  Mine did take about 20-25 minutes to completely bake.  I let the pie rest 10-15 minutes before cutting to let it set up.  As I said before, my guys loved it.  When they reheated the leftovers, they added a dollop of sour cream and enjoyed it even better that way.  Thanks Michael St. Laurent for sharing your recipe \u2013 it is a keeper for my family!",

I did do a few things differently though...I didn't have any lard so I used about 3 Tbsps. butter 2 onions instead of 5 which seemed like A LOT to me and no raisins. IMO this did need some salt and pepper. It's not that this recipe was complicated b/c it was not but I just felt like it took me all day to make it lol...maybe I was just in one of those moods today lol. Oh also it took longer than 15 mins. to finish in the oven once I put the top crust on (took more like 30 mins.) but that was fine b/c I had the extra time. The flavors are great and this cut beautifully. I would most likely make this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

After browning I cooked filling ingredients in slow cooker instead of oven - low for 4-5 hours. I added cornstarch slurry in last hour to aid thickening. I used just a top pastry crust when baking. By my calculation eliminating the lard reducing bacon and using one crust reduces the calories/serving to around 400 & cut fat by more than half and the fatty ingredients weren't missed. That's a win! Next time I'll try a puff pastry top crust.",

I made a quarter of this since I had 1/2 pound of very rare steak in the freezer I was looking to use up. I used bacon grease instead of lard and then didn't think the mushrooms were even worth the trouble for such a meager amount so I doubled them(there still weren't too many for me). I didn't know what size/type of onion was intended so I used 3/4 of a large vidalia and that was about right for us. I did not use the raisins. There was a lot of stuck-on \"browned bits and flour\" in the skillet when done so I sort of deglazed it with the beer to get all the flour in the broth. I used 4 oz instead of 3 oz for the 1/4 recipe and the broth was nice and thick. I made individual pot pies and the bottom crust shrunk a little but was nice and substantial. The whole thing popped right out of the pan. I served it with Scottish Bubbles and Squeak Patties which I left in the mashed form rather than make patties. All this for recipe group 3/16/13:)",

                "reviewBody": "Made for Recipe Group. I just dusted the cubes with flour until they were all coated. I also salt pepper and garlic powder sprinkled the meat first. Not ever having lard here I put some olive oil in the skillet(by mistake) added about 6 tbsp of bacon grease to go with and browned the meat. I chopped some already cooked bacon added that to it. Sauteed one huge vidalia onion that I sliced instead of minced(more would have been good)and added that to the steak. No raisins (hubby would not have eaten this with them in there) and I forgot to pick up some stout so Bud Lite went in there instead. I didn't remember to put some holes in the crust before blind baking and it split cracked and puffed. Added the steak mix in anyway which I thought was still way too runny. I thickened it with a little flour slurry first. Put on the top crust vented to release steam and baked till brown. Upon cutting to serve the bottom crust had pretty much disappeared into the meat mixture. Beer gives this an excellent flavor much to my surprise. It does need a little something in there maybe a dash of hot sauce and some Worcestershire for next time. And just a top crust. Loved the flakiness of the pie crust with the rich satisfying flavor of the meat part. All in all I'd say it is something I would like to make again. Thanks for the recipe! (I did saute some mushrooms for hubby to add to his part:)",
