Chocolate \"ganache\" - 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 TB of milk, melt in microwave (30-60 seconds more or less, stirring frequently) and then stir until smooth.  I do this in a Pyrex glass measuring cup and then just pour the chocolate filling into the tart cups.  I sprinkle a little coconut on top (which I sometimes color with food coloring- like red, white and blue for 4th of July or red and green for Christmas) OR put a raspberry on top OR a little crushed almonds on top for an Almond Joy flavor.  Lemon curd - just dollop lemon curd in the tart shell and top with a raspberry and then sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Chocolate Cheesecake - just dollop refrigerated ready-made cheesecake filling into the tart shell and top with chocolate ganache.  Raspberry cheesecake - put a small dollop of raspberry jelly in the tart and top with ready-made cheesecake filling and top with a raspberry and /or a little chocolate ganache.  Really, the combinations are endless.  I personally don't think pudding and cool whip sound very appetizing for these delicious tart shells.",

Next time I will splurge on time or money and either buy or make my own lemon curd - instant lemon pudding just doesn't have the intense lemon flavor I was hoping for. Or maybe I'll just replace some milk with lemon juice when I make the pudding...either way will certainly make again. Thanks Andrea!",

If you only have 18 either multiply the recipe by 1.5 and do two pans worth or save some batter and do a second batch of another half (fill the remaining cups w/ some water). I also found this incredibly sticky and I couldn't use my fingers. I sprayed the back of a measuring spoon for every cup w/ cooking spray. This was a bit of effort but pretty darn tasty especially to the coconut lovers in my family. I filled them with the lemon curd from this site (amazing).",
