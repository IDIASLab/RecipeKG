They taste peanut buttery, but light and unusually for eggless cookies there is no baking soda aftertaste!\nI used margarine instead of shortening, semi-skimmed milk + 1 tsp vinegar [for buttermilk] and only half the salt. I baked at 180C for 11mins in a fan oven and they came out chewy in the middle and crispy at the edges. I also froze half the mix to bake later as it made about 50 cookies.\nNext time I might try it with crunchy peanut butter.\nI'm going to add a photo so you can see how they came out.",

Then I found this recipe and I'm glad I did! Believe it or not it even scaled down to one cookie very successfully (I have a terrible obsession with eating enormous amounts of cookie dough so I have to limit myself). I did sub margarine for the shortening and omitted the salt as I never have shortening in the house. Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside delicious. I may use a bit more peanut butter next time though for that bit of extra flavour.",

I used cup margarine and cup apple sauce in place of the shortening I used cup white sugar instead of a whole cup and I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk. I got 5 dozen out of the batch and they needed 12-13 minutes in the oven. I think the lesser amount of sugar might have affected the texture of the dough (I prefer roll-and-flatten cookies to drop-and-flatten ones) but the cookies while not quite as beautiful came out tasting great.
