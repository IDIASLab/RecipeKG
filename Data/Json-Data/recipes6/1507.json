We made rice and grilled veggies (a blend of green peppers, onions, carrots, & brussel sprouts)to go with the.chicken. We ended up making it layered with rice, then veggies, and topped with chicken and sauce. It was so delicious and surpassed my expectations. It was so light tasting for a summer day. I also think it would be an easy.dish to make.while out camping as well! Will DEFINITELY do this again and will recommend to.my friends!",

                "reviewBody": "I was trying to replicate a sweet whiskey sauce that a local restaurant uses for their chicken sandwich. I found this recipe and thought it might be close. There are a few things I did differently. I marinated the chicken for a while before grilling. I added extra brown sugar and also honey. I also ditched the mushrooms in favor of onions since onions seemed more appropriate for a sweet dish than mushrooms. The result didn't quite turn out like what I was trying for, but it was still very good for a first attempt. Next time I will try to make it sweeter and I will use less pepper. I like spicy foods, but there are plenty of other sweet and spicy chicken recipes out there and I wasn't expecting spicy with this one. \n\nOne note on preparation:  Since I marinated the chicken, I obviously had the liquid ready before grilling. I recommend doing it this way to cut down on overall cooking time. Get the sauce simmering before the chicken even goes on the grill, otherwise it will take even longer than the 45 minutes this recipe indicates.",

Then sliced each thigh with an X and placed in a plastic bag with the marinade and let sit for 6hr. or so in the refrigerator. Then while grilling it I heated up the marinade with adding a little more pineapple and whiskey and let it reduce for about 10-15 min on med high then basted the chicken with it while cooking on the grill. Served with rice and corn on the cob and salad. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe to use from.",
