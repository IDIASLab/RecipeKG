These cookies reminded me a lot of the ones my mom made when I was a kid. The only changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine and natural chunky-style peanut butter. Also I dipped a fork in a bit of soy flour before pressing the dough balls down (in the familiar peanut-butter cookie pattern) to keep it from sticking. Thanks for the great recipe!",
