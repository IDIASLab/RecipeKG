One note: the finished oats came out stuck to the edge of the pot, so an occasional stir should remedy that problem.  **UPDATE** made it again, this time I coated the pot with butter, used brown sugar, omitted the appleasauce, and cooked it for 6 hours.  After 3 hours, I checked it, and the texture ws PERFECT.  The full cook turned the steel cut oates into a textureless mush.  THis shorter cook maintained the integrity of the oats but remained tender and creamy.",

Probably closer to 5 and a half.",

                "reviewBody": "I just made this last night and it came out great! I did add unsweetened applesauce and I'm glad that I did for the added moisture. I was a little worried after reading reviews about it burning cause I only made a half batch but it was great after seven hours. I did use the almond milk and I think next time I might use all almond milk to up the protein. The only change I made was to add about 1/2t salt to enhance the sweetness of the added fruit (in my case dried cranberries). My husband loves a good thick oatmeal and this hit the spot on a cold morning. He commented about how much better it was than the commercial stuff that has so much added sugar and wayyyy too much salt not to mention the preservatives. I'll definitely be making this often in the winter. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE 4/12/17: I've made this every week for probably the last six weeks now switching out different fruits or mixing them. BIG TIP: once you know how your slow cooker handles the recipe PUT YOUR SC ON A TIMER!!! Mine really only takes about 6 hours to cook this to perfection but I'm not setting an alarm to get up at midnight to start this. I can put the recipe together before I go to bed and wake to perfectly done oatmeal. Also I make a half batch on Sunday and can stretch it for the whole week's breakfasts by nuking it with a little milk and adding some dry cereal to it; my hubby likes the added texture too. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!",
