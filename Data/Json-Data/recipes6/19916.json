(55 min in total) and the cheesecake was done but the crust was a little dark. The next time (and there will be a next time) I will either lower the temp to 350 and cook for 55 min or cook it in a water bath at 375 and check at 40 min and see if it needs more cooking. Another option might be to cook for 40 minutes and then turn the oven off and leave it in there for an hour. It really is too good to not try again.",

Also when I baked crust put it on cookie sheet as 1st time it seemed butter leaked onto floor of stove. Found it very creamy & rich...this can be made anytime of the year when looking to make a chocolate cheesecake. Just know that the macaroon bottom does give it a coconut flavor.",
