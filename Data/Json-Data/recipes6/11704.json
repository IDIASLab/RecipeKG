After adding the flour mixture the dough would not pull together so I added 2 Tbs of sour cream which worked beautifully. I rolled the dough into a log rolled the log in colored sprinkles wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for an hour in the fridge. Cut the log into 1/4 inch rounds and baked. Had to watch the cooking time so the bottoms would not brown too much. For me these cookies did not need 25 minutes to bake. Very good.",

I've made several variations: Chocolate laced plain (w/out chocolate) Pecan sandies Lemon Lemon Lavender and I've decorated with frosting and fondant flowers. The dough holds it's shape while baking so it makes beautiful cutouts and springerle. Wonderful Wonderful recipe!!",
