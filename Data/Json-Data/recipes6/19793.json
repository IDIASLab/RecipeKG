It's ok this way, but my grandmother off-the-boat-Swedish made this every winter with a few more ingredients. We use only cinnamon sticks (2-3 in a large crock pot or dutch oven). Use currants instead of raisins and reduce to 1 c. I use 1 whole package of dried apricots (best you can get), 2 granny smith apples (or other firm, tart apple) pared, cored and sliced thick, one small orange or tangerine seeded, sliced (peel-on) instead of the lemon juice. I cook this to a slow boil on the stove and transfer to a large crockpot on low and cook it until I feel like turning it off! We serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top in a large mug or bowl. It's also EXCELLENT as a \"glug\"- throw in some vodka, some port, some rum- whatever you fancy. It is great hot (especially with company over- the entire HOUSE smells wonderful!) but it's also great cold (the tapioca makes it gel up- it's thick when cool) on it's own, or served over oatmeal for breakfast. I like to serve it with shortbread cookies on the side. With the pitted prunes it's not the prettiest soup to serve- it's rather brownish and chunky, but if you can get past the look to the taste, you'll be hooked. Plus, it's good for you!!",
