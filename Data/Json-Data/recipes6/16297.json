By the time I'd tried them all, I finally figured out the main problem with all of them was: no directions to cover the darn thing while it was cooking. If, after the pudding is set, you want to brown the top, then turn the broiler on for a few minutes (2-3) and remove the cover. However, all of us came to the conclusion that the best was simply to leave it covered the entire time. This recipe had a particularly a nice taste, even though I had reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. However, since I was making it for Passover, I didn't put in the graham crackers -- and don't ever remember having a Kugel with this in the past. This recipe, though, did give me the most important information to finally develop my own kugel which is what I was after: trying to recreate the taste and texture from my Bubbe (great grandmother). I did make quite a number of changes in the end, but without this one, I would never have figured it out at all.",
