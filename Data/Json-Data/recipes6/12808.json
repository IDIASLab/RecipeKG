Even then they came out softer that the typical no-bake oatmeal cookie - not that that's a bad thing it just wasn't what I was expecting. The mixture was pretty loose when I placed them on the waxed paper - as usual I used my cookie scoop to get fairly round same-sized cookies. Flavor is excellent - fudgie chocolatey and super sweet. I would definitely make these again but I think I'll try boiling the mixture a bit longer (4 to 5 minutes) to get a firmer more fudge-like consistency.",
