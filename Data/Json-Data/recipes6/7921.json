They were good but I didn t taste quite as much Korean flavor as I would have liked. In the future I ll add more seasoning and perhaps add some gochucjang sauce. Served with mango ginger rice some stir fried bell peppers and onions and a Thai-style peanut sauce for dipping. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
