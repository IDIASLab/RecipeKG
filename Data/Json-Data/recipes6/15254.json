I didn't add the mini marshmallows decorated the marshmallow creme instead. My husband said this was the best ice cream cake he has ever had! We especially love the fudge sauce recipe. I used a premium baking bar of bittersweet chocolate (60% Cacao) and it was just the right sweetness. The fudge sauce keeps perfectly in the frig then we just heat for 15 - 25 seconds in the microwave. YUMMY! We are having it as a dip for strawberries and pineapple for tonight's dessert!

Instead of graham crackers I substituted oreo cookies and sprinkled the toasted almonds over the coffee ice cream. I also used up the rest of the heavy whipping cream and made whipped cream to place on top instead of the toasted marshmallows. I thought the marshmallows would be to sweet.
