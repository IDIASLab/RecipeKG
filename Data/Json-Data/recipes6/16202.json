I also used half of Hershey s Dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa. Using the cake as a base I added the following loosely following another recipe: Once cake cooled I poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake. Then I used a mix of.5 cup creamed butter.3 cup of /granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes. I put one can of cherry pie filling (excluding juice) on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream. I put the other cake on top then laid another can of cherry pie filling sans juice on top followed with more whipped cream. I used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when I made the cream for the middle and top of cake which was perfect. I had one slice right away and while it was good thought it was missing something but didn t know what. The cherries were somehow boring as well. The next day somehow it was wonderful! It was very moist and the flavors were enhanced. I originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time; however each day that passes (day 3 now) the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake! I will definitely use this recipe for any chocolate cakes I make from now on!",
