Once the meat was almost cooked I added green peas corn bell peppers and mushrooms to the meat. After a few minutes I added the nutmeg sage salt red chili powder and some basil and parsley for taste. Once the meat and peas/corn was cooked I added about 4-6 tablespoon of pasta sauce to give it some texture.Make sure you do not put too much to the point that it is saucy...add just enough so the meat is not so dry. Then add the mashed potatoes and bake in the oven with some cheese on top. When I made this dish I had several people over for dinner and they all went back for seconds and thirds. I hope all these ideas help you!",
