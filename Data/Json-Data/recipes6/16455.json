Did learn a lot after so many batches:   use half the butter and only 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  Let the mixture come to a boil and then boil for 4 minutes STIRRING OFTEN!  This was easier than dealing with the candy thermometer for me.  This will be a family tradition and I can't wait until my girls are old enough to help make this with me!",

                "reviewBody": "I was totally new to the idea of making flavored popcorn so I tried a few different recipes. I tried this one the Kraft Gelatin-based Recipe (on their website) and a traditional crunchy candy coated popcorn recipe available searching the web. This one was the least to our liking. This project is messy so in my opinion I would opt for the one that produces the best result for the work involved. To me that is a crunchy popcorn kernel with wonderful custom flavor. Gelatin-based recipes tasted well gelatinous. THey were gooey gummy and stick-in your teeth tacky. The traditional candymaking version which included making a candy coating (sugar butter corn syrup flavored oil) removing the mixture from the heat to add baking soda coating the popcorn baking for an hour and stirring periodically produced exactly what I expected. The result was crispy crunchy sweet flavored kernels that could be easily broken up before storing. It was just like opening a box of crunchy cracker jacks or Poppycock except the recipe yielded loads and loads for very little money. To sum up there are much better recipes out there. This gets two stars for initially peaking my interest in the item and helping to educate me on the process of making my own addictive popcorn snacks but I won't be using it again.",

I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added baking soda. The result was a crispy dry popcorn that you usually find on boardwalks and at fairs.   I also baked it for about 40 minutes and that dried it out even more and made the taste pop.  I am anxious to try try other flavors.  This will be a good recipe to use at Halloween. I plan on using berry, pineapple, peach, orange and pina colada. I will also make grape but add a few drops of purple food coloring so it does not turn grey.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",

I did find that margarine worked just as well as butter (used 1/2 cup as suggested by others) and I didn't need all the sugar..it's sweet enough with just 1/2 cup. Didn't use the thermometer. I just boiled it for 3 minutes & baked it at 250. Very fun and yummy treat!",
