I knew that even if I had to tweak it a little I d like it. Better to be safe than sorry I thought so I reduced the vinegar a smidge. When it came time to serving I really did like it a lot but I also thought if I had it to do over I d probably reduce that vinegar even more. As for Hubs he said he liked it but left half his serving on his plate. The way I figure actions speak louder than words. He did make the comment however that it was a little too tangy for his taste buds. So in hindsight using just half the vinegar called for would have been just right. As for the sugar I left it out and didn t miss it. Cut the vinegar a tad and this recipe is elevated to five stars and may even be better than Julia s hers doesn t have bacon! Note: I used small long red potatoes (not sure what they re called) and didn t bother to peel them. I sliced them 1/4 thick and they were cooked through but still pleasantly firm at about four minutes.",

I can't imagine bf liking that much vinegar so I only put in a splash or too and I cut down the amount of beef broth as well. Instead of mixing all the liquids separately I browned garlic instead of onion with the bacon then added all the liquid and sugar (left out the salt bc bacon is plenty salty on it's own) and reduced it for about ten minutes then poured over the potatoes. Although I like how sliced potatoes look I'm not a fan of them in this dish since they fall apart and aren't easy to eat so they are probably better diced. All in all this has great potential but I completely modified it to make it palatable in our house so we wouldn't have liked the recipe as is. thanks for the recipe!",
