The sweetness wasn't bad(I used Splenda instead of sugar) but followed it to a T. It is refreshing lighter then I thought it would be. It did taste a bit instant...but ya know. I don't find that bad at all. My kids really liked it and that's all that matters. It will be made again. Because we really didn't find anything bad at all with the recipe. Thanks Patty.",
