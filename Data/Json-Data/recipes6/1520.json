I grew up with a father who is 'allergic' to the smell of butter (his other 'allergies' include cilantro and lamb). As such, our French toast, along with any other sauteing endeavors, were prepared using oil. I've had French toast numerous times and wanted try a different approach today. And that is when pineapple sage-scented challah French toast was born. Welcome to the world! I hope you have a long, successful life.",
