Without flour the cookies melt across the pan into a continuous thin fragile layer. 1 cup of flour added with the oats is sufficient to make the cookies turn out a normal cookie thickness and diameter. I did substitute butter for the shortening maybe this thinned the cookies a bit but the substitutions list on this site says they can be interchanged and I doubt the shortening would make such a large difference.",

Definitely add that cup of flour the first reviewer suggested--you need some binders with these cookies. They aren't the prettiest; even with my cookie scoop they spread out with weird edges. They do taste good but they need to cool a bit on the cookie sheet before removing them or you end up with cookie pieces. Thanks for the recipe!",
