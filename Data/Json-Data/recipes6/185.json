We all love it, but I'm always amazed how many guests beg for the recipe saying that they have never tasted anything like it. The cloves and Worcestershire sauce give it a lovely kick. It keeps really well, so can be made days in advance. It is also a great (and easy) holiday gift.",

We had a currant glaze last year on a ham and we really wanted to have one on our own ham so we were looking for one we could make that would be similar. We omited the vinegar and put in the entire jar of currant jelly which was about 2 cups. We also added an extra 1/2 cup of currants because we liked having a lot of currants. The glaze was delicious and all 7 of my kids ages 8-16 loved it!",
