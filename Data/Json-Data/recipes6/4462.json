The turmeric makes the soup a bright color and adds a bit of flavour.  This takes longer than the 35 minutes listed to cook.  I let mine simmer for an hour and the veggies still weren't soft.  I pureed a bit of it and ate it because I was starving, but I let it cook for another hour.  It tasted much better.  I will make this again, but I will give myself a lot longer to make it.  I'm thinking that this would make a good slow-cooker soup.",

After 15 mins of simmering, the carrots and celery were still crunchy. I ended up simmering the soup for about 30 mins, covered. By that time, a lot of the liquid had reduced down, so I added about 1/2 cup more broth and just under 1/4 cup of wine and simmered an additional 5 minutes. I have to admit, when I tasted it the first time, before it was fully cooked, I didn't care for it much. Once it simmered for 30 mins, the flavors really developed and concentrated and turned into a simple soup that's packed wth flavor. The tarragon is a nice touch, so don't leave it out!",
