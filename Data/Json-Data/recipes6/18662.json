Of the three recipes I've tried, I found this one is the best.  I lived in Japan for a year and found that this recipe has a great, soft texture.  I added two drops of red food coloring (which looks like traditional Japanese mochi).  You could also add two drops of green food coloring as well.  Traditional Japanese mochi is usually pink, green and white.  I LOVED the powder that is used in this mochi recipe.  I do not like using plain cornstarch (has a chalky feel), so the addition of sugar and salt made it perfect!  I can say that if it is cooked too long you will get  hard corners (I'd use the shortest cooking time).  I used an 8 x 8 glass baking dish.  If you don't have a plastic knife, just dip your knife in the powder before each cut.  I found that this worked well.  Also, mochi is kept at room temperature.  So, do not put in the refrigerator, or else you will get hard mochi.  Good luck!",

I only used 1/4 cup splenda(1/4 cup=1/2cup sugar) and it tasted... not bland but not sweet. However when i rolled it in coconut it tasted absolutely delicious. I omitted the potato starch just because I dont like the dry taste it gives it. I tried to make mochi ice cream out of this but my mochi pieces were too thick so to those who also want to try this or fill it with anything (including adzuki bean) i would recommend making two batches but with the same amount of ingredients that way it's thinner and easier to roll and fill.",
