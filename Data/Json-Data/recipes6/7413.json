I did do some minor changes.FIRST I only had 1 can of red beans so I had to cut the measurements down a tad bit..While my rice was cooking (I made my rice in a rice cooker) I minced 3 garlic cloves (I love garlic in my beans) and minced 2Tbs. Of fresh onion. I then only had 1/3 of spam in the fridge..So I chopped it in cubes and browned my spam in a skillet (I like my spam crunchy).. While my spam was starting to cook (about 3-5min).. I added my garlic and onion and lowered the heat to med. I cooked it until my onion and garlic were soft..I then added it to my beans in a pot and added 2 TBS of butter to the pot and cooked it as described in the original recipe..It tasted fantastic! My friend and I polished the whole pot of SPAM/beans off and still wanted more! I think next time for 2 grown people I will use 2 cans of beans..",
