I left out the rice vinegar because I didn't have any (and because I like my soup a little less sour) and subbed lemon juice for citric acid. I threw in some chopped celery leaves because I like the flavor. I used the chili garlic paste (rooster on front green lid) 1 tbsp and it was VERY HOT... will probably decrease that next time.

Finally used red Thai curry paste and low-sodium soy sauce. I'm unsure where the \"sour\" comes from - I used double the rice vinegar (love vinegar) and it wasn't really very sour at all.
