The only change we made was to double the buttermilk (the cheap kind; 2% milk and lemon juice) a little more if the batter sits very long. If we plan ahead we let the oats soak in the buttermilk overnight in the fridge which makes the oats a little softer. Either way this recipe is a winner.",

I made my first few pancakes with the \"original\" batter but then added milk until I liked the consistancy better to all my other pancakes. Both tasted great but I did like the pancakes with a little more milk in the batter better. Plus they were easier to spread out. Very yummy though so just keep adding a little more milk until the batter is creamier.",

This recipe is almost where it needs to be--it's just too thick as is. I added a little more milk but the little overmixing I had to do made the pancakes flat and tough. I should have read through the reviews before I made this recipe. I'd like to try these pancakes again with adjusted milk or oats and see if I can get a better result the next time. I'd also grind down the oats to a finer texture in my food processor as well. NOTE: If you want to add chocolate chips like me just mix the batter up and after you ladle your batter onto the griddle sprinkle your chips over each little batter circle.",
