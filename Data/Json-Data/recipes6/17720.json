I have one my cousin gave me that calls for 2 sticks of butter and it's much lighter and tastier.  I tried this one because everyone commented on how easy it was to work with.  It is easy but the flavor is more important to me that the texture of the dough.  My family is used to tasting the cream cheese and it wasn't there with these cookies.  I'll try to post Lynda's Cream Cheese cookies in case anyone is interested.",
