I usually use fresh seafood but my fiance bought a 2-lb bag of precooked shrimp and we rinsed it under cold water for 3 mins. to defrost and it worked out great. I substituted the parsley with cilantro (added a much better flavor) and garnished with sliced avocado on top and saltines on the side. Delicious!",

Also the recipe did not state to do so but I think the canned oysters needed drained. The end result had no eye appeal and it dominated in oyster flavor to the point it was overbearing. I think draining and rinsing the oysters would be the key here.",
