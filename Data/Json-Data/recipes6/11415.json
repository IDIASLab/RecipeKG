I changed 3 things:  reg. milk + 1 teaspooon lemon juice in place of buttermilk as I was out of it.  1/8 teaspoon nutmeg was added and also I covered my raisins with orange juice and brought them to a boil, letting them simmer for a couple of minutes.  Took them off the heat and let cool.  Drained them and added when prompted by recipe.  Baked in 3 (9\") Cushionaire pans for 25 to 28 minutes.  Frosted with 16 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extracts and 32 oz. powdered sugar sifted.  I had a carrot cake fan taste this and he said it was the best he's ever eaten.  It is!  Thank you Brian for this recipe.",

Even though this site says that the 'Best Carrot Cake Ever' is the best, this recipe won out over it as we had a family and friends \"taste-off\" before we made our final selection. It by far had the most flavor.  Not too moist, not too crumbly.  At the reception, person after person raved over the cake and asked for the recipe.  We had very little left.  Just enough so that we could enjoy some the next day.  We did make a few minor changes.  We omitted the coconut, walnuts and raisins.  And increased the carrots to 3 cups.",

                "reviewBody": "Okay, I've baked this cake over 20 times and so I consider myself an expert on this recipe. (I always mentally thank \"Grampa Sam\" every time I bake it.)\n\nFirst of all, to \"clwguy,\" who gave this recipe a 1-star rating:  YES, LEAVING OUT THE PINEAPPLE WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULT! You can omit other ingredients (I myself forgot to add the coconut last month) and still have a great cake, but *not* the pineapple.\n\nBefore baking this cake the first time, and even since, I've read through dozens of reviews of this recipe.  Here's my advice, based on what I've read, plus my own experience:\n\n1.  CUT THE CINNAMON BY HALF, as others have suggested.  (Adding a little nutmeg and/or allspice is a great idea.)\n2.  PECANS ARE PREFERABLE TO WALNUTS, which can often impart a bitter taste. Pecans are naturally sweet, and work much better in this recipe.\n3.  Consider OMITTING THE RAISINS. Lots of folks just don't like raisins, and in any case I believe they overwhelm the other ingredients.  (I've left out the raisins for several years now, and all my friends are crazy about this cake.)\n4.  DON'T USE YOUR FOOD PROCESSOR to slice the carrots; they'll end up too long and stringy. Grate by hand -- it's worth it!\n5.  DIVIDE THE BATTER INTO TWO PANS, and test the loaves after 35 minutes.  (One hour is way too long for this cake, and would account for a couple of the negative reviews I've read.) \n6.  Suggestion: try the \"WHIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING\" on this site. Scrumptious!",

Only thing I did first time was omit the raisins (personal preference) and divide mixture into 3 pans for a 3 layer cake used with \"cream cheese frosting II\" from this site. Second time around I halved the ingredients and still made a wonderful 2 layer cake. My only suggestion is to use your food processor throughout various stages to cut down on time and convenience which then makes this quite a quick cake to prepare. This is definately going to become a \"secret\" family heirloom for me as well. Thank you Brian for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "Oh my goodness !!!! This was the ultimate best carrot cake I have ever had...and my guests agreed.  As others recommended, I used Cream Cheese Frosting II.  It was equally delicious.  I used two 9 inch cake pans.  The cook time was approx. 45 minutes at recommended temperature.  I sprinkled cake with crushed & whole pecans.  This was a very tasty & attractive way to serve the cake.  It really dressed it up.  Will continue to make this cake over & over again.  However, next time I would like to try a more healthy version utilizing apple sauce verses vegetable oil.  I'll let you know how it turns out...",

                "reviewBody": "I have to say that I was very disappointed with this recipe. After reading all the great reviews I thought this would be great, but then nearly everyone who gave 4+ stars modified the recipe in some way. I followed the recipe exactly and got a dense and moist, yet bland, unsweet, oily cake which tasted nothing like any of the carrot cakes I've ever had. I also thought the cake had too much going on in it. Bits of crunchy carrot shavings here (even though I shredded them super fine with my food processor), pineapple bits there, and an occasional raisin. The first thing my fiance, who loves carrot cake, said when he saw the cake was, \"that does not look like a carrot cake,\" and he is right. It is a very dark and un-carrot cake like color, more like rye bread. My biggest regret is that I wasted a can of perfectly delicious whipped cream cheese frosting and a half pound of walnuts for the topping.",
