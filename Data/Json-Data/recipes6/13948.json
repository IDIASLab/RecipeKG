One quick note: I notice a lot of ppl subbing fresh ginger for jarred or powdered in recipes - Buy a \"hand\" of ginger, wrap it in plastic wrap then put in a freezer bag, and use as needed. It's super easy to grate this way - just peel a small amount, grate away, then back in the freezer. Hope that helps someone.",
