It was spicy and had a great tang! I also sauteed the mushrooms and onions in a pan before added to the chicken because I don't like the taste of steamed onions and mushrooms and was afraid that was how they would cook in the foil. The chicken cooked perfectly moist and juicy in the foil packet. We took the suggestion of sprinkling some cilantro on top of the chicken and I am glad we did! The cilantro gave it a fresh taste and worked perfect with the flavors in the bbq sauce.",
