I didn't bring the water to a rolling boil because I knew that would break them apart. They were much like dumplings. As soon as they rose to the surface (about three minutes) I put them in the ice water to cool. I was not happy with the sauce. It was just to flabby. It needed some creaminess so I added a bit of butter but it just needed some cream and maybe a dash of nutmeg. I will try that next time. Other than the flabby sauce the dish had possibilities.",
