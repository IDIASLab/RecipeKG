I didn't read the reviews before started this cooking - but I allowed it to cook the entire time with the lid off - and I added 3/4 cup brown rice for the last half hour and it was perfect consistency! Another note I didn't have any honey because I'd used it all for a loaf a bread I was cooking at the same time (doh!) so I just used 2 tsp of sugar. It was a bit sweet - and next time I do this I'll use only 1 tsp. I'll also half the water and use only 6c of broth.",
