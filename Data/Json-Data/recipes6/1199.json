Took less than 5 minutes to put together. It's not my mom's cinnamon toast. Took a couple of tastes to get use to it but this stuff is very good! I'm serving this at my next Sunday brunch and probably many other occasions. Thanks Patty Cakes!",

Well NOT ANY MORE! This rum butter will liven up your toast bagel muffin pancakes etc in no time flat!! I only made a small amount since it lasts a while in my house. I also used Turbinado sugar b/c I was out of br. sugar. This is AWESOME! It reminds me of the Hot buttered Rum batter I was gifted at Christmas;) Now I don't have to wait till the holidays to enjoy a special treat! Thank you Very much Phoebe!",
