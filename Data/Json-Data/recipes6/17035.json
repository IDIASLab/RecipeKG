Because of the sugar in the pudding I reduced the white and brown by about 1/3 and reduced the salt by 1/2 at suggestions of other reviewers. I would also grease the cookie sheets with a thin layer of spray. My cookies stuck about after cooling for the allotted time. Cookies were definately a success though. Chocolatey soft in the middle and a little bit crispy on the outside. A keeper!",
