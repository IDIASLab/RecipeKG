So I just completed two loafs: one with 1/2 c. starter and one exactly the same without the starter.  the breads came out virtually the same!!!! I was hoping the starter would add a tang or ? but there was no taste difference and we actually preferred the texture without the starter, it was a bit moister?!? \nSo I'm afraid I will omit the starter in the future....",

It makes the bread very moist, and it stays moist for days.  Our favorites include:  add 1 cup of craisins (dried cranberries), 1 cup of walnuts, and 1 box of vanilla pudding.  Another includes:  1 smashed banana, 1 cup of walnuts, and 1 box of banana cream pudding.  Yet another is 1 cup white chocolate chips, 1 cup macadamia nuts (chopped), and 1 box of white chocolate pudding.  YUM!!! These are always big hits, and are great for the holidays!  I'll warn you though, you may think you've done something wrong when you mix these in on day 10, because the batter is more the consistancy of cake batter than of bread dough, but it's OK, it bakes up just like bread.",

Still works perfectly. By the way, a favorite is pistacio pudding & chopped pistatios!! Excellent!",

I promise if you will change this recipe to 1 cup self rising flour add 1 more egg 1/3 cup more oil and increase cinnamon and vanilla to 2 tsp. also add 1 small box of vanilla pudding - you will get rave reviews.

But my favorite to date is adding in a bag of cinnamon chips and sprinkling some of the sugar/cinnamon on top also. YUM! Next batch I am going to make some orange flavored sugar to coat the pans with and put ing cranberries and some orange peel. Also want to try adding rhubarb as soon as my rhubarb is ready.

I made 9 loaves using all of the starter except 1 cup. 3 were apple and pecan sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, 3 were cherry and the last 3 were something I hadn't tried before-peach. I don't know what was better, the bread or sharing the day with my granddaughter cooking the loaves. She took 1 of each flavor home with her. What a great day we had making new memories!!",
