Believe quality beef, rice and spices, sauces, can make a big difference on taste and how a dish turns out.\nMy picky husband loved it as well as my teenage boys. Only I like sour cream and topped mine with it, which was really great. \nI will make it again but add in sliced black olives. I did add in chopped red and yellow peppers with onions, served with warm tortillas, salad and crescent rolls. \nThank you very much for the recipe!",
