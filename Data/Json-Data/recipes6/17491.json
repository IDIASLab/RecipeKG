I found that I was not making any headway with the double boiler so just poured the mixture into a teflon coated pan and heated on low til it boiled stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Nice and soft and found that you don't have to work quickly with these when attempting to roll as the mixture stays nice and soft and pliable. Rolled in toasted coconut/chopped pecan mixture. I used mahjool dates and hand chopped into large bits. I found that the dates blended into the egg mixture and were not whole chopped in the cookie. That is a great thing for those that stick up their noses at dates. It more or less added a bit of a nutty taste to the mixture. Presents beautifully for the holiday trays as well. thanks for this wonderful non-chocolate addition to a holiday tray!",
