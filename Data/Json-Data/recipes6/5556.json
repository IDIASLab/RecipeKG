Topped with mozzarella cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Don't be afriad of green ortega chilis - they are usually VERY mild.",

I also omitted the green chillies (scared it would be too hot) and used green beans for a bit of colour. It ended up really yummy I do think it HAS to be simmered to let the cumin and chilli powder release their flavour. Great recipe!",
