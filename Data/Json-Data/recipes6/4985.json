The reason I am marking one star off is the cooking method. I think it is overly complicated. Saute the veggies in a stock pot add the rest of the ingredients except flour and noodles. cook until desired tenderness of veggies. Mix the flour with some water and temper it with the stock.. add it to the soup to thicken... no need for the oil or cooking the veggie separately. I do think keeping noddles separate is a good idea as leftover noodles in the soup would soak up the broth and make them mushy",

I did add spinach tofu and mushrooms but that didn't seem to go well with the broth either. I may try to tweak this to my taste but I won't make it this way again.",
