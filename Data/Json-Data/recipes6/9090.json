I did add some sliced fresh garlic and chopped shallots to brown in the butter before the chicken went in,  and I used a bag of mixed munchkin potatoes, cut in half (instead of large potatoes). After the vegetables and spices went in, I poured 1 cup of chicken broth over it all and let simmer, covered. About 40 minutes later, the chicken was done and I removed it to a covered casserole so that I could cook down the vegetables and broth a bit to thicken the \"gravy\". The chicken was juicy and tender, and the \"au jus\" added a great touch to pour over it all. My husband, who is a fan of dark meat because he says white meat is always dry, went back for seconds.",

And bone-in and skin-on chicken is what made this soooo moist! Also the cooking time mentioned is definitely too long. Fortunately I put in a meat thermometer - the kind that has a cord attached to it so you can still close the lid and an alarm will go off when it reaches the right temperature. It only took about 20 minutes and it was so moist and perfect. Also honestly just use whatever seasonings you typically like on meat and vegetables - that's what I did. I would also say that 4 potatoes are too many unless they are very small potatoes. You have two pieces of chicken so this is a meal for two people. You only need enough veggies for two and there's no way my husband and I each would eat two whole potatoes. I also added chopped onions to the veggies because we like them...",
