Once again this year for Thanksgiving I bought fresh Yams in hopes of finding a recipe that my family would actually eat. I will never have to search or hope again. This is the recipe I will use going forward. Only change I made was to use fresh Yams. I simply washed the Yams well with cold water and threw them into the oven with the Turkey. No foil no butter/oil... just as they are. Pulled them out of the oven after about 45 minutes. Let them cool for about 30 minutes then peeled and mashed. Followed the recipe from this point on omitting the corn flakes and nuts. My husband refuses to eat anything with nuts too but that's another discussion. I made everyone take at least 1 small \"no thank you\" bite and was amazed when they actually LIKED it and scooped on a regular serving. Thanks for posting this great recipe!",
