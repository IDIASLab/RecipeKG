                "reviewBody": "After making this recipe as described, I thought it was good, but made a few adjustments to make it great. 1) Instead of the pea/corn mixture, I buy a frozen vegetable package called \"latino blend.\" This package contains corn, black beans, tomatoes and green peppers, which add more body to the dish and makes it more Mexican. (If you can't find it in your freezer aisle, then I would use frozen corn and two cans of black beans instead. The peas just didn't blend well with the other ingredients.) 2)I have yet to find a decent packaged taco seasoning, so I just make my own: salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, cumin, a touch of cinnamon (or allspice) and red pepper flakes if I want some heat (amounts depend on your own taste preferences). 3) For the potatoes, perhaps this goes without writing, but I pour the mashed potatoes on top and then spread evenly with a knife, otherwise, some sections will be thicker than others. 4) Finally, place the pan on a tray. The pie won't boil over or anything, but it is heavy and just makes it easier to place in and out of the oven. The dish does take time, but while the pie is cooking I make a simple side salad and the overall effect is a great winter, comfort meal far better than any meatloaf. Thanks for the recipe!",

I did take the suggestion of another reviewer, however, and used black beans instead of the peas, and sour cream instead of the milk, for a more Mexican flair. Add just enough milk after mixing the mashed potatoes and sour cream to make it more spreadable, then top the beef mixture. In the last 5 min. of baking, I removed the casserole from the oven, and while it heated up to Broil, I brushed some melted butter over the top of the mashed potatoes and topped this with some shredded tex-mex cheese. Then, under the broiler until lightly browned. This gave it a slightly more crusty top, which appealed to my family. I made up a batch of the \"Taco Seasoning I\" recipe for use in this. ",
