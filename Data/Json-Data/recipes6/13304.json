I baked a fresh pumpkin in the oven first and that truly gives it the richest flavor since the sugars carmelize so nicely that way. I reduced the milk to 1.5 cups added 2 extra tablespoons of flour and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. That actually was PLENTY of sugar so don't overdo it. I will make this one again and again.",

Instead of canned pumpkin I baked two pie pumpkins and it worked just great. This was a hit at the party. One girl's mother spoke to me several weeks later and asked for the recipe because her daughter raved about it so much. I didn't really follow the spice amounts. I just added however much I felt like and it worked perfect! You cannot miss with this recipe!",
