At times I have added a pinch of nutmeg for a hint of flavor. Also another good tip for icing these cookies is to melt some white chocolate thinned with a few tablespoons of crisco and then dip the tops of the cookies into the chocolate. Very good and much quicker than using frosting. You won't be dissapointed with this recipe!",
