They re the prized light and crispy along the edges and soft and chewy on the inside. Just a perfect cookie but in my view not as good as it could be because I m afraid of the orange slice candy which made these TOO sweet. Hubs however would disagree. He loved the little pockets of intense orange sweetness. For myself I d love to see any number of things substituted for the candy (chocolate chips dried berries coconut nuts chopped candy bars raisins etc.) given that the cookie itself was so perfect.",

Next time I will cut the candies into smaller bits. I cut each one into 4 pieces but even smaller would have been better. I only got 4 dozen cookies from this instead of the stated 6. These could probably be done with spice drop candies and other gummy candies as well. The batter is really great on it's own and doesn't really even need the candy to make the cookie good.",

I think the adults looked at them like \"what's in here?\" but the kids (and I) had 4 or 5 cookies each.:) Like I said they were a hit with the kids.
