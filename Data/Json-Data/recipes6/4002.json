A healthy, hearty breakfast muffin. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was good.  The second time I didn't have buttermilk or apples so I subbed apple sauce and raisins.  My only critique of this recipe is that I do think it needs a tad more cinnamon and salt, but that is just my personal preference.  For a breakfast on the go it's perfect.  Nice and moist too!",
