I wasn't too sure what size to form the log so I ended up rolling it to about 14\" long and I found the cookies were a little thick - next time I'll roll it to approximately 12\". Or another option is to just flatten them a bit when you put them on the baking sheet. The flavor is good but I might cut back on the salt or use unsalted butter. Lots of options for swapping out flavors by using different spices and extracts. These aren't very sweet but I like them that way. I baked these for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I put the extras in the freezer and they are SO good right out of the freezer!",
