Traditionally a cake of this type has pretty standard directions: cream the butter or shortening and sugar(s) add eggs one at time then add the sifted dry ingredients alternately with the liquid beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. The second problem is that the baking time as directed is far too long. Even at 25 minutes I believe my layer cake was overbaked which I'm sure contributed to the third problem which is that the cake was not nearly as moist as it should have been. The flavor was great and I did add 1 tsp. of double-strength vanilla. Now the frosting is perfect - silky fluffy light and smooth with just the right amount of maple flavor. But even here there was a problem. Other reviewers have commented they had too much frosting for their 9x13\" cake. I on the other hand made a layer cake and did not have enough frosting to frost the sides. Unfortunately given the issues with the mixing and baking instructions and the fact that this was on the drier side I can only call this an average cake even though the frosting was simply perfect and beautiful.",

Like others my cake was done in 25 minutes and I was very thankful for the reviews or I might have walked away from the oven and ended up with a burnt cake! I split the batter into two nine inch rounds so that may have had something to do with it. Otherwise the recipe was great tasted just like the spice cake I remember. The spice ratio was PERFECT but overall not quite strong enough for me so I would probably increase the spices by half next time just to my own preference. I didn't have any maple extract so I tried substituting some of the sugar in the frosting for real maple syrup. The texture was fine but the maple flavor was hardly noticeable--just a warning for anyone else who might try the same thing;0). Otherwise it was great. Thanks for the recipe!",

I did make a few changes but nothing that substantially changed the recipe. Most of my changes were in the directions because I'm really anal when it come to preparation. First I sifted the flour cinnamon baking soda salt nutmeg and cloves but not the white sugar. I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening and creamed it with the white and brown sugars. I then beat in the eggs (one at a time as directed) as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Finally I added the flour mixture (in fourths) alternately with the buttermilk (in thirds) beginning and ending with the flour mixture. I know this sounds complicated and time consuming but it really isn't. I baked my cake in a 13x9 pan for 35 minutes. 45 minutes is too long. I always use an oven thermometer so I know my oven is correct. Anyway I frosted it with a traditional cream cheese frosting and my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it! So thank you Stephanie from both of us!!",
