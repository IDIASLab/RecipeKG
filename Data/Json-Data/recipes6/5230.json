I could probably double the soy chorizo, as it's my absolute favorite meat substitute and I can't get enough of it. Your mileage may vary. I also don't get too caught up on what should or shouldn't be in chili.",

I also used Trader Joe's soyrizo and one can of pinto and one can of blackbeans.\nI made the recipe as written with the exception of the adobo sauce.\nMy entire family including my 7 yr old grandson loved it. It was super easy to make and uses ingredients I carry in the pantry. This will be great addition to our meals in the cooler weather!",
