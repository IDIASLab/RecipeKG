Cake flour has different properties which makes it a weak flour, in turn that's why cakes need binders and such, also they are generally lighter, as opposed to bread flour which have properties that are unique and makes bread flour a strong flour. That's why breads are generally tougher than cakes. A.P. flour can be substituted for any of these but the ending results will differ slightly from its intended texture.",

To the questions that was asked... if the center of the pudding falls in don't stress when you pour the sauce over it will again puff up. before you pour the sauce over use a knife to get the sides loose. This makes the sauce absorb easier and the end is a awesome saucy pudding enjoy",
