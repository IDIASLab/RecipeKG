I modified it to just 1 cup of oil,  added 1 tsp real vanilla extract and  scaled back to just 1 cup raisins. Blend (not stir) the first 4 ingredients then beat mixture for 1 minute after adding each egg, it makes a great difference in the texture. For the \"nutty\" taste I folded in 1 cup walnuts with the raisins.  Pour on a warm buttermilk or creamcheese glaze and YUMMMM!!! I have made it 3 times since and it is quickly becoming a favorite!",
