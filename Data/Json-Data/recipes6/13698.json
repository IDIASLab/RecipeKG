I didn't butter the bread first or mix the bread in with the mixture I layered the bread in the pan and poured it on top. I added butter last in slivers randomly on the top after it was all put together. I added allot more cinnamon than it called for and in one of the pans I added a can of pumpkin into the mix. The pumpkin one was a SMASH hit! Thankyou for the recipe! For my first time making bread pudding it was a foolproof and an easy one to do! Happy Holidays!!!!",

I made the following changes: 4 qt (10x15) glass baking dish, 1 doz extra large eggs, 19 slices of cinnamon bread, 1 cup golden raisins which I placed in a bowl of very hot water (to plump up) for 15 mins, 3 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cup of sugar. I let the bread soak up the egg/vanilla mixture for 15 mins before I added the other ingredients. Didn't need the cinnamon or nutmeg and didn't butter/toast the bread beforehand. Baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 mins. Very, very tasty!",

Mine was very thick & custardy with a nice crusty top even though I realized after I skipped the 'toast bread' step. Mine was already a couple of days old and nice and firm which helped to spread the butter and not smoosh the bread. I had to use about 3 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups half&half as that is what I had on hand. It wasn't grainy at all even without a water bath which I really liked. I also accidently dumped quite a bit of cinnamon after the shaker top fell off (oopsie!) but if this hadn't happened I think it may have been too bland. I will make this again with the same 'adjustments'. Yummy!",

I also topped it with a vanilla sauce I found on another recipe website and it made this recipe beyond belief. In case you're wondering the vanilla sauce I used was: 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of whipping cream. Cook over medium heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add 1 tsp of vanilla. Wonderful!",
