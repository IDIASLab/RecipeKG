I used two boxes of the Jiffy mix, doubled the eggs and milk, but used only about 1/3 c sugar because the Jiffy mix is so sweet. I also added one fresh chopped jalapeno, which added enough flavor to make my husband happy without making the cornbread too spicy for me.  I baked it in an 9' square pan for about 10 mins longer.  It was super moist and the perfect side for my chili. Thanks!",

I made a few changes, but nothing drastic: I skipped the sugar entirely (the creamed corn is already sweetened), used 1% milk instead of regular, and baked it in muffin cups (350 degrees for 25 minutes). I will make this again and again with no other changes. Delicious!",
