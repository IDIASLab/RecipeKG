I used dried cranberries (a.k.a. \"Craisins\" from Ocean Spray) in place of raisins and that worked very well too. My only word of caution to other readers about this recipe is that all bread machines are different and what works in one might not work so well in another. In my machine these buns although most definitely edible did not rise enough making the bread very dense. If you prefer your buns to me more \"fluffy \" I would suggest adding an entire 2 oz. packet of yeast or perhaps try the special \"Very Active Dry Yeast\" that's made just for bread machines. All in all my Easter guests enjoyed these buns and I will be making them again.",
