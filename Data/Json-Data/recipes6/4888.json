Usually I shy away from recipes that doesn't have a lot of reviews yet, but I'm glad I didn't on this one. I was more than pleased on how this turned out. I didn't have Marsala wine but I used port wine instead. I also only cooked a half of chicken as well. When I opened the cooker after it was done, it looked so good the way it was I omitted the oven browning process. I also may have over cooked everything just a tad because the onions, carrot and lemon became one as a really awesome sauce that we pour over the juicey chicken meat, loved the taste of the lemon in it! To me this recipe is a winner.",

I shoved a seated lemon in the cavity of the chicken and then rested it on top of the plums and shallots. I poured 1/4 cup chuckle stock. I cooked one 4lb chicken on the \"meat/poultry\" setting for 22 minutes. I let the chicken sit for 5 minutes before I manually released the pressure. I broiled the chicken plums and shallots for 5 minutes. Perfection! I'm going to do it with the other chicken now.",
