I warmed it up by putting the whole pan back in the in-stapot and set t0 slow-cook 2 hrs (while we drank coffee) so it was hot and ready to eat when we were. Only thing I did different with the recipe was just add about a 1/4 c honey to mixture before cooking and sprinkling the brown sugar on when ready to eat. It was sooooooo yummy with \"Oz's Banana-Nut and Raisin Bread for ABM\" posted on Allrecipes.",

                "reviewBody": "No offense to the original author as this recipe is great for a quick and easy Fall breakfast. However I have a few suggestions for getting the most out of the flavors. 1. Toast your oats. I used butter but coconut oil or ghee also works well. Turn the saut\u00e9 function on high and when display reads hot melt your fat. You can brown the butter if you have the time and patience. Then stir the oats around in it until they are golden brown about 3 minutes or so. 2. Bloom your spices. Once oats are toasted sprinkle your pumpkin spice over them and stir until fragrant around 30 seconds. 3. Add maple syrup. I put 2 tbsp of grade A dark amber directly into the pot after blooming the spices. Stir it in and coat the oats before turning off the saut\u00e9 function and adding the water and milk. (I stirred in a little more when the oats were done.) 4. Toast your walnuts or pecans before adding them as a topping. You can do this in a skillet or in the oven. Trust me it s worth it. I personally used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of skim. Oats came out perfect and creamy. Will make again.",
