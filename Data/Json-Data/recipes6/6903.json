        "description": "This recipe has to be the best tasting sauerkraut I've ever had. Traditionally, my family serves pork and sauerkraut every New Year's Day for luck in the coming year. I love cabbage as a general rule and like most sauerkraut recipes, but they can be quite sour depending on how it is prepared. Sadly I don't remember who gave me this recipe and who deserves the credit, since it was pulled from a collection of hand-written recipes I've kept for years. I made it as a side dish for New Year's Day dinner and it was a complete hit! This is certainly not your typical 'sour' sauerkraut recipe.",

I made one change I started off with Johnsonville Bratwurst sausage, I wiped my skillet down with Olive Oil added the sausage and let them simmer while covered with a lid  for about 15 minutes, I added the onions and simmered for another 5 minutes or until the onions were soft. I removed the sausage and started to follow the recipe from that point by adding the rinsed and drained Sauerkraut.  At the end of the recipe I put the sausage back into the Sauerkraut to simmer for about 10 minutes my total cook time was an hour and 30 minutes, I wanted my Sauerkraut soft not crunchy. I also cooked the entire meal in the skillet cover with a lid.",
