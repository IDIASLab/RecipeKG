Tastes good but wayyyy too rich and sweet.if I ever make it agan I'll only use maybe half a cup of sugar...However now that we've tasted them over a week later everyone seems to start liking them! They seem to taste much less sweet now that they are a bit drier. Perfect texture now. I guess the longer they stay the better they get!",
