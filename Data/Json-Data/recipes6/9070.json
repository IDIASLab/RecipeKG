I followed the recipe exactly as written, using rosemary from my garden, and marinated for 6 1/2 hours. First off, at the 25 minute mark of cooking, it wasn't close to being cooked, which was odd for such a small piece of meat at 425 deg. I ended up cooking it for about 40 minutes for medium and fortunately it was still moist. Unfortunately it was fairly awful! All we could taste was vinegar! I was able to finish a couple pieces (saved by my mashed potatoes), but hubby wouldn't touch it! And heating up the marinade to use as a sauce definitely didn't work, even though I added some white wine and a bunch of butter. Overall a waste of a nice piece of meat.",

Roasting at such a high heat with a sugary marinade causes the liquids to burn. Thankfully the meat itself didn't burn, but there was definitely that burning sugar smell as it cooked.  25 minutes was much too long for my liking. It was cooked well done, but I prefer medium to medium-well.  I'd probably do 15 minutes next time, with 5 minutes rest time. This paired quite nicely with mashed sweet potatoes.",
