If you do use 2 cans...rinse and drain only one can of beans, cause the chili needs a little more liquid to it.     Also, the picture that is shown...doesn't look too appetizing, but don't worry, its WONDERFUL!!!  Enjoy!!!!",

I bought and used one whole roasted chicken from the store instead of ground turkey meant and took the meat off the chicken and placed it into my pot along with 1 cup chopped onion, 1cup chopped red pepper, 1 cup chopped green pepper, and 1 glove of finely chopped garlic. Instead of using water I used 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used 2 cups of salsa instead of one. With the few changes that I used with this recipe made this an award winning hit at my job...

Making it again for a friend tonight!  My husband has told everyone about this, he just can't get enough of it!  So it's already a request!  I took the suggestion of adding the beans with the juice.  This did not seem too watery at all - I thought the texture was perfect!  I also used hot Salsa and shredded Cheddar cheese.  Make this!  It is SO easy and yummy!  Everyone will enjoy it!\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  8/24/04  This has been a biweekly meal for the last 8 months so I just had to update.  We also add chopped onion and don't add the water.  We have also made it w/o cheese for my brother and he has requested it again.  Because this is so easy to make, we give it out when friends or family are needing meals it's a good change from the typical casserole.",
