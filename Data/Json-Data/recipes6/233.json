I looked at other posts and didn't add any milk but in retrospect I think 1/4 cup would have been ok.  I used 93% lean ground beef.  I minced and saut\u00e9ed the onions and carrots first in 1 tsp of veg oil.  I also added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the meat mix, will probably add two next time.  I did not put the brown sugar in the topping, only mustard and ketchup.  The 10 minute prep time for me was very unrealistic.  It was more like 35 minutes.   Will definitely make this again.",
