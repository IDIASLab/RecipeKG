It was a hit - all the men just loved it! Bacardi Select dark rum makes all the difference. The sauce was the reason - since prior reviews indicated the sauce was runny I cut the water down to 3/4 cup. The secret is to bring the sauce to a boil and continue boiling for 5 more minutes while stirring constantly. Remove from heat and then add the rum. This is how the glaze for Rum Cake is made so I figured that had to be the way to make it thicker and it worked like a charm. I also added a touch of Watkin's vanilla for more flavor. I will note that the texture on this cake is very dense and somewhat crumbly not like my usual creamy cheesecake. I will now make this every year for New Year's Eve!",
