Especially good with a dollop of whipped cream.  It might keep up to a week in the fridge, but it's never lasted that long at our house! Dark chocolate pieces may be used in place of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of chopped pecans, trying arranging pecan halves in an eye-pleasing manner on top of pie.",

The only problem I had was the filling over flowed and really made a mess. I used a 9\" deep dish crust as stated. This is why I rated this with 4 stars. For taste it has earned 5 stars! I came across this recipe the day before Thanksgiving and just had to try it. Will make it again but will use an even bigger pie plate.",
