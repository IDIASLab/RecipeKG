When chicory is combined with a sweet and tangy mustard vinaigrette, mixed with toasted, crunchy nuts, and wonderfully rich, subtly salty blue cheese, it all makes perfect sense.",

I didn\u2019t have rice vinegar or blue cheese so I substituted apple cider vinegar and feta, respectively. I like fruit in my salads so I took Chef\u2019s recommendation of adding apple slices.",
