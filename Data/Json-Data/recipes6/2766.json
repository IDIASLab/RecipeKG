Instead of preparing this in 2-3 steps, I took the advice of another cook and dumped everything into my InstantPot at once, frozen bone-in thighs and all. I used the manual setting for 30 minutes, allowed the pressure to release naturally for about 10 minutes. The liquid was thin, so I added a little thickener (about 2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed thoroughly with about \u00bd cup milk) and put the InstantPot on saute mode. After about 5 minutes the sauce had thickened to a honey consistency, and I served it over white rice. My family enjoyed it thoroughly. I hardly have enough for my lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much for sharing such a simple and yummy recipe!",

I wasn't sure if the ingredients called for boneless or bone-in chicken...I assumed boneless but I used the chicken thighs I had purchased for cacciatore so I up'd the cook time to 15minutes. I was also confused by the directions to saut\u00e9 after cooking the chicken since I knew there would be liquid from the chicken. Instead, I fixed the pepper and onions and saut\u00e9ed separately on the stovetop. Then after I released the pressure and added the remaining ingredients, I also added the pepper and onions on top. The chicken finished cooking/braising in the sauce made from the liquid and soy sauce (plus all additional ingredients). I let it cook down and thicken a bit but stopped cooking when chicken was done and when there was enough sauce to pour over rice. This is like a sweetened version of adobo chicken. Sooooo happy with the flavor!!! Thanks for a great keeper recipe for the instant pot!!",

I didn't change a single ingredient, but I did make changes in the preparation. As others have mentioned, the Instant Pot requires liquid in order to come to pressure, so I placed the boneless thighs on a rack over 1 c. water. I found 8 minutes at high pressure and 6 minutes natural release was perfect. Then I set the chicken aside, drained the pot, and proceeded with the recipe, not adding the chicken (which I cut in chunks) till the pepper strips and onions were crisp-tender. I decided to thicken the sauce with 1 tsp. cornstarch in 1 tsp. water.",

I did not have any chicken broth otherwise I would have used broth.\n\nThe chicken was delicious!  So moist .  I will definitely make this again.
