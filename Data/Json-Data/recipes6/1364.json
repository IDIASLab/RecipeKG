Used one today and froze the other with the rub on. We didn't find it spicy at all as the other reviewer did. This is a really good recipe! Glad we tried it. Thanks for sharing DADCOOKS.",

It IS really spicy.\" As indicated by another review, yes, it's a fiery rub, but I also found it to be too sweet w/ even the 1/4 c. of brown sugar from my halving all of the seasoning. I can't imagine using all of the rub on a 2-3 lb. cut of pork. My pork loin was done in about the time indicated by the recipe, and we were too impatient to eat (smelled really great while baking!) Daughter would not eat it (\"milk milk milk! Too spicy!\") and I found that I only liked it once it had sat out for awhile and I was able to slice it really thin and put it on a sandwich. If I were to make this rub again, I would decrease the black and red peppers along w/ the brown sugar, but keep the rest the same.",

It had the wonderful sweet hot flavors we love in my family,I didn't have dry mustard so I ommitted it but do not omit the cumin because that ads a special taste that the rub would not do well without.I made it for last Thanksgiving and my cousin begged me to make it again.I may use this rub on my spiral ham this year.Thank you for sharing, this is the best pork rub ever!If you find it too spicy you are a wimp :-)",

I cooked the roast at 250 degrees instead of 350 and slowly roasted it for 3 to 4 hours. I used the drippings from the pan to make a really thick pork and apple flavours gravy using only flour and water and it turned out amazingly moist and flavourful.
