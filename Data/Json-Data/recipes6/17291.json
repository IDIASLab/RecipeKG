I'm so glad I followed the recipe exactly as written!  Whether you call it a cupcake or a muffin, this is a nice little treat - most important, what we always look for first, they're moist.  But they also have their own, unique little flavor going on, not quite banana but not quite apple, with a hint of spice. I'm also glad I preferred to keep it on the \"bare naked\" side, even though I was tempted to frost or glaze these.  I merely topped them with some demerara sugar (aka sugar in the raw) which gave them a sparkly crunch.  Growing up in Milwaukee, where the submitter says this recipe originates, I can see how these would have been a part of the great, ethnic cooking and baking traditions we have here. Very nice recipe - (love the shredded, not chopped, apples!)",

I doubled the recipe and made a two-layer 9-inch cake and 12 cupcakes. I took the time to read a lot of the reviews and diced my apples instead of shredding them. You could taste both the banana and apple what a wonderful combination! This will be one of my special recipes that will be made often. Thank you for sharing!:-)",

Instead of grating the apples I chopped them up into small slivers instead. I used fresh nutmeg also I think that makes a huge difference in how the muffins taste. I got a little less than 24 muffins. I think I ended w/ 18 small muffins. I wonder if I can substitute half of the \"shortening\" and use applesauce instead? Because I did grate some apple into the mix and it tasted fine. I ate a couple of muffins and threw the rest into a freezer bag. Pull out and microwave for a quick breakfast or snack.
