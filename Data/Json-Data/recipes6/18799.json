I first tasted it at a supper given by a lecturer in seventeenth-century literature when I was at college, and it took our tastebuds right back to the Restoration. It can be prepared as either a parfait or a punch--please note that either version contains alcohol, so you may not want to serve this to younger family members.",

It's essentially glorified whipped cream but that's not a bad thing! It comes together easily and earned me tons of praise when I hosted dinner a few weeks back. I used half splenda half sugar incorporating the sugar first and the splenda after I had stiff peaks. I chose Pacific Rim Dry Riesling because it's relatively inexpensive not too sweet not too dry. I plan to add this recipe to my permanent collection. Thanks again!",

I put sponge cake in the bottom of a parfait cup, then a layer of fresh blueberries, and then topped with syllabub and a few more berries. It was wonderful!!! Although, with the added sugar from the cake and berries, in the future I would reduce the sugar added to the whip cream mixture, as it was quite sweet. Overall though, it was a huge hit, and I will certainly be making it again.",

They now think I'm this amazing dessert chef.\n\nNext time I will add a little less sugar - I'm not a huge fan of sweet sweets. \n\nIt takes a while to whip - I used a hand mixer on low until I got impatient and put in on medium - it didn't seem to hurt it at all. \n\n\nI'm excited to experiment with adding flavors and fresh fruit.",
