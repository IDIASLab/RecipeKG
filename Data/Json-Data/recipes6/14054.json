The proportions in my recipe are a little different: 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 3 TBSP each of Beau Monde, parsley & dried minced onion & 3 tsp dill weed. I could not find Beau Monde at my local grocier, so I looked on line and found the ingredients for it:\n\n1 tablespoon ground cloves \n1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon \n1 tablespoon salt \n1 tablespoon ground bay leaf \n1 tablespoon ground allspice \n2 tablespoons ground pepper \n1 tablespoon ground white pepper \n1 teaspoon ground nutmeg \n1 teaspoon ground mace \n1 teaspoon celery seed\nIn a small mixing bowl, mix together all ingredients. Pour into a tightly closed jar and store in a cool, dry place. Yields approximately 9 tablespoons.\n\nI had everything except the ground mace and white pepper, put it all together and the dip came out great! I have to admit that I didn't use a full 3 TBSP as I was afraid it would be overpowering. I served this dip with Lays potato chips, but tried it with multi-grain tortilla chips and really like it with those! I know it's a long review, but I hope you find it helpful! :)",

I've never heard of beau monde seasoning and it isn't sold at my grocery store so I added the seasonings to taste provided by a previous reviewer. I think I will keep this recipe because it was a nice twist on your regular veggie dip. But next time I will use fresh herbs. This went especially well with the black and green olives and dill pickles on the veggie tray I brought to Thanksgiving tonight. I like another reviewer am trying to watch calories and used fat free sour cream and light mayo.",
