If I make it again I will do the same as Mama Cass and thicken it more (a lot more) or maybe strain it. My 9\" pie plate was fine. And I weighed the grapes.",

                "reviewBody": "I read the reviews carefully and made the necessary increases in sugar and cornstarch. I was also using up grapes which were so sour they were really inedible--but they were healthy and many so I didn't want to waste them. I however have not made the pure recipe because I decided mid-boil of the grapes and sugar and lemon and cornstarch to add some maraschino cherries and some of the juice and boil it down. I'd made a more buttery graham crust but didn't bake it first but went ahead and poured the filling in and baked all of it for about 45 minutes. Once it was cooled the crust had firmed nicely and the filling went into it somewhat. I then put the sour cream topping on and when it was chilled it became a delicious tart-pie would be very nice for breakfast. I've given the recipe two stars because I don't think it would have amounted to much with just green grapes (although I'm grateful to have found a recipe using them there's surely a reason we've never heard of such a pie) but it does have potential and maraschinos combined beautifully with the grapes. I recommend you try this combo and do use the 4 Tbsp. of cornstarch and a good 1 1/2 cups of sugar as well as enough sugar in the crust and in the sour cream (use twice the amount of vanilla too). The net result is a delightful confection",

I would say that in order to keep it from oozing everywhere cuz it will would be to drain the grape mixture with an strainer and let it drain into another pan underneath it. Then add the grapes into the pie and then add the liquid mixture to even out. You'll end up tossing much of the liquid but then it won't be super gobby for eating either. And I also used 4 tbsp of cornstarch as requested by another commentor plus the 1 1/2c sugar too.",

I still had to drain 98% of the juice and still had plenty of liquid after I poured it in the crust.
