I used 4 cups of strawberries (roughly a pound and a half) and 4 cups of rhubarb (5 long stalks), 5 Tbsp flour and 3/4 cup of sugar.  I probably could have used even less sugar.  Bottom line is, if your strawberries are fresh and ripe, you really don't need that much sugar.  I will likely try 1/2 cup next time.  Then I poured the fruit mixture into a 10 x 15 1/2 bar pan.  I did not adjust the topping-- I made as the recipe called for and there was more than enough to cover the top.  I baked for the same amount of time and at the same temp and it came out perfect!  (just be sure to put aluminum foil down in your oven because the juices run over the side of the bar pan!) This recipe will easily serve 12 and is absolutely the perfect combination of sweetness, tartness and crunchiness.  Great summer recipe!",

I used slightly less than 1 c. white sugar and 4-5 tbs of flour for the fruit.  I also added the zest of one juicing orange, a teaspoon of cinnamon and a few grates of nutmeg - all of which made a big impact on the taste.  For the topping, I made the amount noted in the recipe, but did not use it all - and that was on a significantly bigger batch. Just use what looks right.  I did not change the baking time.

I asked Hubs to taste and review this.  \"Is it too sweet?\" I asked him. \"No,\" he replied, \"It's too good.\"  I can always tell with him when something I make sets itself apart from others.  This recipe is one of those times.  It's quite sweet, that's for sure, but then we didn't have it with whipped cream or ice cream.  (That's because we ate spoonfuls of it right out of the baking dish while it was still warm) I'm sure it would be even better with the ice cream or whipped cream.  The buttery, crunchy oat topping is just perfect  - except that there's far too much of it!  Delicious dessert, just reduce the amount of topping or do what I did and use the extra to top muffins!",

Used 1 pound of strawberries which equalled 3 cups.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4c and added a sprinkling of sliced almonds to the topping; did everything else as written.  This was so delicious; with the sweetness of the strawberries, it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart for us!  Served warm with Vanilla Ice Cream V (from this website).
