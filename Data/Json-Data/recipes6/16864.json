I topped the hearts feta cheese and red onion. I know this isn't the recipe but I still wanted to put up a review. Also I don't find it necessary to put the olive oil on the lettuce before grilling - it's just added calories the lettuce is fine on it's own. A lot of the bitterness in the thicker parts of the leaves go away with cooking.",
