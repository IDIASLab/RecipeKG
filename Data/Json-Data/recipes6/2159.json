I followed the recipe exactly but included some minced garlic and scallions I still had. The ritz crackers I got happened to be the Italian seasoning one and oh wow I think it really enhanced the flavor of the dish! I thought the sauce was a little sweet so would in the future omit or reduce the amount of brown sugar. I don't understand why I would leave some on the side though because the brown sugar was still crystallized and crunchy so I made another side batch without the sugar at all and it was tasty. The cooked sauce melted the sugar so no issues there. Regarding the garlic teeth- I inadvertently turned them green!! Became an incredible effect and perfect considering it's a zombie! I had cooked the meatloaf the night prior then added the fresh cut garlic pieces as teeth. I left it overnight since it was for a potluck at work and the next day the garlic teeth were green! I freaked out at first thinking it was mold but it wasn't- the vinegar from the ketchup that touched the garlic caused some sort of reaction to turn it green! It's the sulfur or whatever that does this and it's still totally edible. Perfect perfect for this dish! Thanks for the idea and simple recipe.",
