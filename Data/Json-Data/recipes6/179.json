I used a small ham and a larger baking dish and after glazing some of the glaze slid to the bottom of the dish and stood a good chance of burning. My Mom suggested adding some orange juice to the baking dish which I did (enough to cover the bottom) and not only did it prevent burning but it made a delicious sauce for the ham! Next time the oj is part of the recipe for me.",

It's exactly the right blend of salty and sweet, everyone at our dinner party LOVED it! I only made one adjustment, which was to add about 2 teaspoons of maple syrup, just because the original recipe wasn't quite liquidy enough to glaze the ham. Will definitely make this one again!!! :)",
