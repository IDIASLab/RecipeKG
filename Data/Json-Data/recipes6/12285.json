So many variables--the level of ability of the baker, the size and shape of the cookies, baking times, and imperfect oven temperatures to mention a few. Not to mention personal preferences...chewy or cakey, thick or thin, and on and on. I made this exactly as written, leaving some of the dough mounded, and flattening other batches slightly. The dough is just right...easy to work with. I found this dough will do whatever you want it to in terms of thickness.  The cookies come out of the oven with pretty much the same shape they went in with. Having said that, I still found this a good, but just average cookie (three stars to me means average).  A little on the thick side and not quite as flavorful as other recipes. I think if all butter were used it would take care of both issues. There are a lot of good chocolate chip recipes out there--my personal preference continues to be \"Chewy Jumbo Chocolate Chip Cookies\" on the Land o' Lakes website. Still, I would not discourage others from trying this recipe, as it just might be your favorite!",

The reason you need a lot of ice cold milk (as suggested in the final part of the recipe) is that you need a ton of milk to soften them up. Coming out of the oven they are hard (not crisp) on the outside and dry in the middle. As they cooled they just became hard all the way through. And yes I brought them out of the oven while they still looked light and undercooked.",

I added a third egg and about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of oat flour to get to a good consistency (if choco chips can be 'plucked' from the dough without the dough sticking, then you're good to go). Tip: put rolled oats in a blender until flour-like if you can't find oat flour anywhere. Oat flour makes a chewier cookie, but don't substitute it measure for measure. My other chewy cookie secret: A teaspoon of regular MAYO. No, you can't taste it, and NO NO NO don't use Miracle Whip!!! THAT would be awful.",

Add 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise after beating in the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, before the dry ingredients. Wow! It was amazing.

I actually like these better the second day - they're a little gooey because I take them out when the middle's slightly underdone but by the time they've cooled out they are absolutely fantastic.
