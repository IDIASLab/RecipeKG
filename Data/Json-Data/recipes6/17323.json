I enjoy it without icing but added for work an icing made of 1 and 1/4 c. icing sugar sifted 2 tbsp. softened butter and maple syrup until it was the consistency to drizzle over the cake. I found by purchasing chopped dates separated by a little flour that the prep time was considerably shortened. I also found that I could make some extra cupcakes as the recipe was quite large.",

I scaled the recipe for 8 servings instead of 16 and reduced the amount of dates and walnuts by half since the ingredients are expensive and I am not very experienced. The cake still came out really well. The one thing I realized half way through was that there were very little wet ingredeients and after I added the yolk the batter was still not wet and homogenous. I almost gave up at that point. If you are new to baking don't worry about this the cake turns out yummy despite this. Another hurdle was the dates; they were really soft and were sticking to each other. I dusted each piece with flour before mixing them with the other dry ingredients and the remaining flour. This can be time consuming but worth the effort.",
