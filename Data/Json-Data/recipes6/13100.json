My cookies came out with a great texture and flavor but are a bit drier than I prefer. Also the white chips did not want to adhere to the batter and didn't melt very well in the oven. Definitely a great dipping cookie!:) The flavor reminds me of a mocha java drink. Next time I will use regular chocolate chips.",

I switched the amounts of the brown and white sugars and added a tsp of canola oil.
