I occasionally add mild banana peppers on top for my husband since he is a fan of spicy things.",

One thing we ALWAYS do before eating the sandwiches...cube up some Velveeta and bury about 5 chunks into the meat mixture before placing on the top bun...let them melt into ooey goodness before taking that first bite...YUMMY!!!!",

We didn't have any vinegar so it was omitted and my son doesn't like onions so I used onion powder. I also added a little red cayenne pepper. I made them with ground beef the first night. They were so good I was eating it out of the pan. Night two the kids begged me to make them again. All I had was ground pork but I gave it a shot. They were fabulous. I'm glad I have more ground pork because they want them again tonight. I think we'll have a nice light chicken salad on Sunday haha.",

This recipe uses the same base ingredients minus the garlic powder but in different proportions. These modified proportions and the addition of apple cider vinegar make it perfect! The only thing I changed was the addition of some chopped green pepper. Obviously omit that if you or your kids don't like them.",
