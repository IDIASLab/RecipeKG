Then I covered it and let it rise for 25 minutes, punched it down and put it in a sprayed bread pan.  Covered it again for 10 minutes then took off the cover and turned on the oven.  It rose for about 15 more minutes while the oven heated up.  I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and it was perfect. ",

I used the dough cycle and followed the previous reviewers suggestion of shaping it into a 9 bny 5 loaf pan and letting it rise 30 minutes (although next time I'd probably let it rise 45-60 min). Then baking it at 350 for 35 minutes in the oven.  Turned out perfectly!  My husband LOVED it and said I should make it every morning! We had half the loaf left over for a couple of days and I made the BEST garlic toast with it...slice 3/4 inch thick, generously butter both sides, put on baking sheet lined with nonstick aluminun foil, then mix 1/4 cup parmasan cheese with 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning, sprinkle on each slice of buttered bread (on top side only) and then sprinkle the top of the seasoned side with a 3 tbsp. shredded mozzarella cheese.  Bake at 400 for 10 minutes or so until bottom is toasted and top cheese is bubbled and browning.  These were so delicious with spaghetti, much better than the frozen 'Texas Toast' you buy at the store.  This bread is requested especially for the garlic toast I make with it! I bet it would make wonderful French toast as well!",

I covered the bowl with a damp towel and let it rise punched it down and let it rise again. I would've liked to have let it rise a bit longer the second time but I was in a bit of a time crunch to get it done. It baked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees the top got nice and golden and could've stayed in another 5 minutes or so. It cooled in the pan and when I turned it out it was gorgeous. It was light and dense at the same time. I can't wait to make this again. I made it last night and have almost just the heel left...",
