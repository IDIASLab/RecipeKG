I also used fat free half and half, which did not seem to affect the flavor or texture of the chowder at all. I also added some crumbled bacon toward the end, which is an ingredient from another fish chowder recipe I have been making for years.\n\nIf I do make this soup again, I would either cut the potatoes into larger cubes or simmer it for less time. The reason being is that when I whisked in the flour and butter mixture, most or all of the potatoes dissolved into the soup. This made for a more \"mealy\" mashed potato type of texture, which my husband does not find to be appropriate for Clam Chowder.\n\nI think I would also saut\u00e9 the celery before adding the rest of the veggies to simmer, thus cutting down on the simmer time.\n\nOver all a hit for our family!",

I didn't remember having to do so much to actually give this chowder some taste; but this time I added a teaspoon of thyme 5 slices of diced bacon 4-10 ounce cans of clams with juice and a lot more pepper. As written there simply aren't that many clams or clam flavor and the chowder is very under-spiced. Originally Reviewed: Apr. 16 2003 Fantastic. Simple to make and delicious. I added 4 6.5 oz cans of clams instead of the called for two 10 oz cans and served topped with bacon and cheddar cheese.",
