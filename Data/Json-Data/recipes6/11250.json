Since I read the review that said the cake was dry I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I cooked it in a silcone bundt pan that I got for Christmas (the first time I used it) so it seemed to cook slower. It needed the full hour but it browned nicely and was moist and delicious. My guests loved it!!",
