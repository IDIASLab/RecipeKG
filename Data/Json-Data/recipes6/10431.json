I then topped them off with some chopped pecans and more shredded coconut. Yummy!\n\nTIP - To get your batter to dome, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. As soon as you put the muffin batter in the oven, reduce the heat to what the recipe says. The initial high heat causes the batter to have greater oven spring or the rapid rise during the first few minutes of baking.",

Our favorite it adding about 1 cup smashed banana and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts added cinnamon and vanilla. I spray my muffin tins with Pam instead of using the liners. You can be so creative with these... with different fruits/jams/preserves and/or veggies/meat and/or cheeses and spices! Thank you SOOOOOO much Lori for posting this recipe! This is a keeper and it has become a family recipe! We give you 12 thumbs up from all 6 of us! This ROCKS!!!! Mmmmmmm!! Oh... I bake them at 350 for 30 minutes.",
