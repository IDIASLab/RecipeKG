Its been 6 mos. since I went to P. F. Changs, so my memory is a bit shaky.  I'll take my husband's word.  The only change I would make is to double the sauce.  Use half for the marinade and keep the other half for basting while grilling.",

The meat falls right off of the bone, and the flavor is amazing. I added about a tablespoon of minced ginger root to the marinade to kick up the asian flavor of the ribs. Also, no extra salt is necessary- the soy sauce is salty enough. I have made them twice now, both times in the oven in a roasting pan. Definately double the sauce if you cook them in the oven, and turn the riblets a couple of times throughout cooking- there won't be any sauce leftover- it will all have soaked into the meat. They make great leftovers too!! These are a must try!",

This was a nice change from the usual however I felt the sauce was a little too salty. Definitely leave out the 1 tsp. of salt. Soy sauce is salty enough by itself. Next time if there is one also take the advice of another reviewer and double the sauce. You have to constantly watch these babies because the sauce really burns easily. Even if I don't make this recipe again I will definitely boil my ribs from now on before barbecuing. It saves on having to cook them in the oven for two hours!",
