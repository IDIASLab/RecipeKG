I would suggest that you add a little bit more brown sugar, cinnamon, and milk. That's it. Don't change the recipe all around and then say that its bad cause its not if you just follow the recipe. Lastly, DONT SHORTEN THE COOKING TIME!!!!! Mine came out perfectly in about 40 minutes.",

It turned out pretty good and it has a lot of good flavor. I didn't have problems with it being rubbery or flat like a pancake. I would definately recommend atleast adding one egg to boost flavor!

It's really a 'coffee cake' like taste/consistency and it's not too bad for breakfast, hence the name it was given. Enjoy!",
