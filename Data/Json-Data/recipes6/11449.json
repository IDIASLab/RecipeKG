I did run my cherries through the food processor for a coarse chop then set them to drain on paper towels before I tossed them with the mini chocolate chips in a little of the flour used in this recipe. This really helped them to sink less in the cake. I did bake this in a glass 9x13 pan mine was done in just under 35 minutes. My whole family loved this cake even my husband who's not usually a fan of chocolate and cherries. I would have liked more marachino cherries in the cake. I will make this again but I would double the amount of chopped marachino cherries.",

You could almost call it a cherry surprise because you'll be eating away and then every once and a while you'll bite into a cherry and get this rush of flavour. And the chocolate chips yummmmm. They drop to the bottom of the cake and give this fudgey bottom. This is also a very versatile recipe. I decided to use this recipe as the bottom layer of my wedding cake. I tripled the recipe to fill a 16-inch square cake pan and it came out just perfectly. It's actually kind of kewl to see a 16-inch square cake. It's just huge. It took a little longer to bake but it baked all the way through without burning. The only thing that I would recommend when baking this cake would be to line your pan with Parchment paper or Wax paper. That way it comes out of the pan easily and the cake stays nice and smooth for icing. Thank you for an amazing recipe. Sincerely Martin",

For one thing I believe the reason why many reviewers complain about the chips and cherries sinking to the bottom is that there is too much liquid in this recipe. I made the following changes and it turned out moist fudgey rich and delicious...with cherries (halved maraschinos) and chips suspended evenly throughout and without sticking to the pan at all. Omitted coffee completely (not sure why it's even in the recipe) increased milk just slightly to 1.25 cups used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and used 1 cup (instead of 2...that's a TON!) of the mini chocolate chips. Used a bundt pan and baked for 55 minutes. Turned out wonderfully & made the birthday girl very happy! Made a chocolate ganache as a topping.",

I scaled down the recipe to 12 servings and baked it in a 8x8 pan. Because of the smaller pan the cake was a little thicker so it needed about 15 more minutes to bake. After reading the reviews about the cherries falling to the bottom I waited to add the cherries and the chips until the cake had baked for about 5 minutes. This technique helped. The cherries and the chips were wonderfully distributed throughout the cake. The recipe for the frosting was a bit sweet but good. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar in the frosting recipe. I added a few drops of red food coloring and had pink icing topped with three cherries in the middle. These additions made a really cute Febuary Pre-Valentine treat. Thank you for this great recipe!!!",

Some of the reviews said they were having trouble with the chips and cherries sinking - the way around that is to rinse the juice off the cherries then toss them in 2 tbsp of flour. It helps them stay suspended in the batter. Toss the chips in flour too (but don't rinse them!)I used 1 cup while and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and applesauce in place of the oil. Great cake my family loved it!",

                "reviewBody": "This cake was not that good even my kids who love chocolate cake didn't want it after one bite. It didn't fall or anything like that it just did not have the \"wow\" factor I was looking for. i followed directions to a \"T\" even sifted the flour. It had an alright taste but i think adding in a couple tablespoons of the maraschino cherry juice in the cake batter would REALLY jazz this cake up. Why let it go to waste? i did add some of the cherry juice to my home made whipped cream and it was very delicious. back to the cake- I was so disappointed because I had high hopes for this cake after reading rave reviews. I used skim milk instead of whole maybe it just needed a little more \"fat\" in it from whole milk. But can't see having that much of an impact. Also I found that baking a chocolate cake with cocoa powder as apposed to chocolate baking bars taste more like boxed cake. I probably won't be making this again it was not what i was looking for.",
