        "description": "The blue cheese in this recipe lends a creamy quality to the cottage cheese layer and only a subtle, pleasant touch of flavor. There is no mozzarella in this non-traditional lasagna that will have your guests waiting for the recipe handout. (Have it ready!) I have the habit of making way too much lasagna, so this recipe is perfect for keeping my portions under control for our now-empty nest with minimal leftovers. I believe this would work well in a slow cooker, but haven't tried it yet. Don't be afraid of the blue cheese flavor overpowering this recipe - it doesn't!",

I only made two changes. I used 1/2 lb of fresh chicken sweet Italian sausage and 1/2 lb of ground turkey for the meat and layers of spaghetti squash instead of the pasta sheets. I didn't think the cheddar would work but that little bit of sharpness really adds something unexpected.",
