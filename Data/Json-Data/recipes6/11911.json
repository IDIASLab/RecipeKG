These cookies had the perfect amount of sweetness especially when I sprinkled powdered sugar on them. They were not too puffy OR too crispy. Perhaps I made them too large because I didn't get 40 cookies out of them. In fact it was more like 10-12 cookies. However I thought mine were a good size. Oh and they make a very sticky dough but don't worry about adding extra flour. They are good as is! I will definitely be baking these again.",

These are very fragil cookies and need to be handled with care. Cooled for 1 minute before loosening them with a thin spatula left on pan until completely cooled. Since they are such a thin cookie I decided to make them into sandwich cookies using a chocolate ganache that I had on hand. I then coated some with powder sugar and drizzled others with melted chocolate chips. I was able to get 30 individual cookies (15 sandwich cookies).",
