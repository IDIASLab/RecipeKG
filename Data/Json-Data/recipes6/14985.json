If you do not have self rising flour, you can add 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons Salt to the two cups all purpose flour to make your own self rising flour (sift together).  It is clear that the folks who did not like this recipe did not use self rising flour OR overmixed the batter.  Mix gently with a fork and leave LOTS of lumps!  It really is fast, easy, and wonderful!",

The cobbler part was nice and fluffy, not chewy at all. I could barely wait for it to cool off before trying. Yum Yum!!! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!",

Reviewers who found this dish chewy and cornbread-like may have over-mixed or used all-purpose flour without adding rising agents. Mine turned out delishously moist berries ended up on the bottom top was golden brown. My only problem with the recipe is the baking time... my oven is typically slow but this was slightly over done by 45 minutes. So watch closely!",
