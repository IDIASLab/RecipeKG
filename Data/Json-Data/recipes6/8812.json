I also used half of a small bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce instead of a full bottle. The taco seasoning I used was homemade and I used california ground chili powder, which has the same great flavor but is milder and not as hot. I did not try this myself but my husband and kids had this for dinner and they ate almost the whole goshdarn roast on their own. They all called me at work and told me how delicious it was--even the littlest! They all told me that I must make this again very soon. NOTE: We used the meat in this recipe for soft tacos, with homemade refried beans and mexican rice on the side.",

Then when you shred the meat you have the strands of onions and peppers mixed in with it. Served with grilled corn tortillas a corn salsa and a squeeze of lime and it is a fantastic meal. Also a great meat for modified korean style tacos (think kimchi). If you are cooking for someone who prefers a milder dish choose a milder pepper and don't use the hot sauce or cayenne my kids love it this way.",

By scraping off all of the chilies and not using any of the sauce it was edible. FYI: we live in south LA and are very use to cayenne and hot sauce but this was HOT!

Figured I could always add more if needed but it definitely did not need any more heat! The meat was so tender. I served it with a side dish of Mexican rice and the juice was so good on the rice. Thanks for the suggestion to use the meat in soft tacos. I actually have them on hand and that's what we'll be doing with the leftovers. This dish is definitely company worthy if you know your company likes Mexican and spicy dishes.",
