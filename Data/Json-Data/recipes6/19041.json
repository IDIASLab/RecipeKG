I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the apples by sheer accident, it turned out to be fine. I left out the walnuts as most of my family isn't really fans. Its yummy with out the nuts. For the caramel topping try making the Praline Sundae topping from this site (which is out of this world). I love the chopped bits of oatmeal cookie throughout(the hard store brand cookie works great. Awesome recipe I will be making this all summer!",

Competed in State Fair Crank off and place 3rd. This recipe won me Grandchampion and tasters choice award at the county fair level and am taking it to state. I even left the carmel sauce out time ran out to add it I had so many people ask for the recipe. The one thing I did different was I mixed the cookie crumbs with the butter and baked the 5 mins and when they came out of the oven I then patted them down. This recipe is truly a GRAND-PRIZE winner.",

I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings and the mixture fit perfectly in my 1-quart ice cream maker. One small problem- I didn't let the apples cool completely before adding to the ice cream mixture so I think the majority of the apples sunk to the bottom of my storage container (my fault). One guest said that it tasted just like a Ben and Jerry's ice cream that she had long ago. Someone else suggested that the ice cream would be perfect with the fried apples served over the top rather than inside the ice cream. All in all it's a fantastic recipe. Don't be afraid of the steps required to make it- it is well worth all the effort!!",
