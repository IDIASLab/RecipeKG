I agree that the coconut is hard to spread without breaking the graham cracker crust, but have found a simple solution. As soon as you pull them out of the oven after baking the coconut, I use the flat side of a spoon, sprayed with cooking spray and smooth out the coconut. The coconut mix is now more pliable, now that it is hot. I finish recipe as follows. I even sometimes sprinkle a few slivered almonds on top top make them like Alomnd Joys.",

I would highly recommend substituting Hershey's chocolate bars for the choc. chips.  Not only do they add great flavor, but they create a smooth top on the bars.  Add 6 unwrapped bars after they come out of the oven.  The bars will naturally melt over the coconut/milk mixture.  You can then smooth it out over the top.  My mom recommends to score the bars with a sharp knife before they fully set up.  This way you can get nice clean slices.  Also, I love these bars chilled!",

The coconut mixture just wasn't enough to spread out with out tearing up the crust so I doubled it but next time I will just increase it by another half. I melted the chips in a doubled boiler and it cooled to quick to spread well so I made another cup or so to cove it. It does sink down in to the coconut mixture. When it cooled it was hard and turned out a little on the thick side which made it hard to cut. next time I will stick with the original chocolate amount but I will and 1/3 of a bar of paraffin wax which will make it not only easier to spread but will keep it soft when you try to cut into bars. if you don't have wax I highly suggest you precut through the chocolate when it is half way cooled to allow you cut it when its fully cooled without you breaking any chocolate. I am not a fan of coconut (I don't even like Samoa's girl scout cookies) But this recipe is so good I had to immediately package up as my as I could to send to my sister in Iraq to stop from eating them. This is surely something I will take to work to impress.",

Now I've gone back to read the reviews of the photos I've admired to see that the bars were modified by baking in a smaller pan to get thicker bars and by increasing the coconut and/or chocolate layers.  As written, these bars are way too sweet, and I didn't even add the white sugar to the crust.  If I were to make them again, I would tone down the sweetness even more. I'd eliminate the white sugar, use unsweetened coconut, use more coconut (but not increase the sweetened condensed milk with it), and bake them in a smaller pan.  You really have to have a sweet tooth to like this recipe.",
