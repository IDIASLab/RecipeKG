For the butter cream i just whipped up one brick (around 250g) 100% butter at room temp.(make sure you're not using margarine, cuz it would taste funny) until light and fluffy, added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp vanilla and 1/4 cup ground cashews then fold in 1/4 cup WHIPPED Cream. i find this twist gives a lighter nuttier butter cream. for those having some trouble with the meringue sticking, try cooking it a bit longer to make sure the bottom of the meringue is dry so you can easily peel away the parchment or aluminum foil (wax paper doesn't work for me).",

There's one thing very important that was left out about the buttercream, and that is, after you mix the egg yolk and sugar mixture on high speed you need to chill it after that.  Then when it's chilled you may mix in the butter spoonfulls at a time.  If you don't do that the buttercream will come out liquidy.  Also another mistake I made on my first try was trying to use wax paper.  DO NOT USE WAX PAPER!  Parchment paper is great!  Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make many more times.",

I whipped 1c.unsalted butter until light and fluffy add 1/4 c. of powdered sugar a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of clear vanilla. The icing is not too sweet just right for the very sweet meringue. I added 1/2c. almond (chopped)in the icing and freeze it before eating. It reminds me of Goldilocks sansrival. Just a tip I greased and flour the foil and baked the meringue for 10-13 more minutes adjust oven rack in the middle and rotate the pan halfway. Remove the meringue while its hot and place them on a wire rack to cool.Thanks for the recipe. I think the yolk and butter mixture for the icing is way too sweet and heavy.",
