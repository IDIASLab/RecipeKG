Tomato soup is just about my favorite soup, I\u2019ve made a good number of recipes on this site, and I was longing for more intense, rich tomato flavor, even after  adding more tomato paste.  I did like the texture that all of the chopped veggies brought to the soup, as well as its creaminess, but it simply was not as robust as I would have liked.  I might try this again with the suggestion of another reviewer to use  tomato juice instead of vegetable broth, maybe even V8 Spicy.  This is not one of those \u201cthrow everything in the pot Instant Pot\u00ae\u201d recipes, took a little time to make, and again, although it was OK, I still was a bit disappointed.",

I made the roux as directed and used powdered milk cause that s what I had. I added a cup of fresh grated grana padano and parm. I did add the hot pepper flakes as well. Immersion blended together and WOW! Perfect October Sunday dinner. Made giant croutons out of day-old French bread dusted with olive oil and dried fennel to accompany. I would make this again and serve it to guests proudly.",
