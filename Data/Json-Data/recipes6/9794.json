Then, if you want them saltier, DO NOT add more salt and boil some more. Rather, let them sit in their brine as it cools. Every 20 minutes or so, taste one. When they are salty enough for you, drain them. (This means you don't have to taste hot peanuts, and they don't get too soggy. It also gets them saltier quicker.)",

I was excited to learn my dad recently introduced my daughter to them and she loves them.  Make sure you use raw peanuts.  We have tried with roasted and they do not work well.",

Allow to cool off in brine before draining.  Don't drain them right away because they could dry out if you drain them when they're still piping.  Let sit in pot until cool before you drain them..the longer they sit in the brine, the saltier/spicier they get.  Can freeze uncooked green peanuts for up to three months before use.
