I think the sweet potato gives it an edge but it isn't an evident factor. It just has a nice balanced flavour and the Tabasco gives it a familiar afterbite with it's unique taste. I made this in my pressure cooker in about 9 minutes but left the carrots in pretty large pieces. I used a litre of water for a half kilo of carrots and a small sweet potato. The consistency was right on, soupy but not watery. Thank you What's for Dinner Mom for another great recipe.",
