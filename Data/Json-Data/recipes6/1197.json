                "reviewBody": "Absolutely delish but needed some tweaking! I made some modifications to simplified the recipe. First I combined milk coffee brown sugar mint and egg yolks in a saucepan and whisked over medium-low for 15 minutes; no need to temper the eggs. I also reduced the amount of mint down to 1/2 a bunch which is about 20 leaves; I'm glad I did it because the flavor was well balanced. Another important process I did was to add rum a couple minutes before the end of freezing process otherwise it may impede it. I wanted to have another layer of flavor but knew it may overpower the ingredients so I reduced the amount of alcohol down to 1 tsp. After alterations it is definitely a 5 star treat.",
