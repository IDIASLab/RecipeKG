Maybe it's because the crust wasn't baked ahead of time or maybe because I only used an 8x12 baking dish but it came out very thick and with a great texture unlike some crusts that fall apart when you serve them. But the other reviewers are right the caramel sauce is a flop it's like water. Next time I'll just use pre-made caramel topping if anything. BTW don't forget to douse the banana slices in lemon juice or vitamin C before garnishing so they don't turn brown.",

I doubled the amount of mashed bananas and I think it definitely gave the cake a better, stronger, more \"banana\" flavor.   I also \"cheated\" and just used a jar of caramel sauce from the store.  Shortly before serving, I decorated the top with the caramel sauce and sliced bananas around the rim.  This cake is so easy but tastes like you slaved over it for hours!   Will definitely be making this again!!",

I did make some changes though,  I baked it in a 9 in. spring form pan and  I  increased the mashed bananas to a cup or 2 whole bananas.  I had to bake it for 45 minutes as well,  for the caramel sauce i cooked it in a double boiler and only put a little evaporated milk in it  i did not use the whole can.  I will definitely be making this again",
