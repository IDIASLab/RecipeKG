I've been put on a dairy-free diet. A cup of tea without milk in it is too hard to adapt to so I'm on the lookout for an acceptable replacement hot drink in the morning.",

I did scale the recipe down but I still think it needs more tea bags. I didn't have cinnamon sticks but used ground instead. Maybe this was why it reddened up? Not sure but all in all it did have a good flavor combo and I will make it again once I get the sticks. The way I see it \"weak\" is very fixable when the all over flavor is good. update I made this again and used quite a bit of milk this time and it was good.",

I steeped 2 bags to 2 cups of water and that helped a lot. Chai generally is a sweet tea so I did add a generous amount of sugar and cream and it did make a nice and refreshing end to a long week. Next time I'll add more spices and kick it up some.",

As a couple of reviewers mentioned this does have a weak flavor unless I have just become accustomed to the chai tea bags at the store. I cut the recipe in half to 3 servings. I just microwaved the water and spices. Then I added the tea bags and sugar and let it sit the 5 minutes. I had all the spices except cardamom. On-line I found that nutmeg is an acceptable subtitute so I just added a couple pinches of ground nutmeg. With the cost of cinnamon sticks I think it still would be more affordable to buy chai tea bags for 3 dollars a box. Either way I like the recipe for chai latte on here so I added a little steamed milk sprayed whipped cream and extra cinnamon on top. It was more flavored than regular tea I just wouldn't think exactly of chai. It was nice on this cold evening though.",
