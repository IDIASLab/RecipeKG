I wanted to give this as a gift and a 9x13 pan just isn't a size appropriate for gift giving. I used a regular-sized loaf pan. I also added 1/4 c. of golden raisins because persimmon pud just isn't right without them. What a mistake!!! I baked it more than twice the directions at a slightly higher temp and it never set in the center when i turned it out I got a lumpy goopy glob. The crust was delicious but this recipe isn't something that can be converted without adding extra eggs and more flour to bind it. I'd try it again but not for gifts and certainly never in a loaf pan.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is delicious and apparently fairly forgiving. I had 3 persimmons so that's what I used I did not measure them I just peeled them and stuck them in the blender...I also used 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/4 of skim milk instead of the 1 1/4 c milk it called for...then I added a dash of ground cloves and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. I baked it in a glass pie dish for 40 minutes and it is absolutely delicious and set up perfectly. I like it a little thicker so the pie dish worked beautifully for my taste. I was not expecting such wonderful results since I so loosely followed the directions. It was a little lighter in color than I remember my grandmothers being but it was also fluffier - I'm not sure that's the right word because persimmon pudding is by no means fluffy but regardless I really like it and I can't wait for my husband to get home and try it. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe - I will make it again and again! (I also like the fact that there is no liquor in this recipe. Don't get me wrong I like a good stiff drink but I don't like alcohol in my food particularly in my desserts I think it ruins the flavor of the fruit or chocolate or whatever it's being blended with so thanks again!)",
