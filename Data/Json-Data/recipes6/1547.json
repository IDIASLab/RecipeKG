        "description": "Chewy, nutty, chocolaty, and packed with tasty energy, no one will ever know these bars are low-fat and healthy! They're very easy to make and you can pack in everyone's favorite nuts and fruits. My family has now stopped buying Kashi&reg; and chewy bars because we love these so much. These are gluten-free when made with rice flour and appear to be professionally made thanks to the small spoonful of corn syrup that keeps everything tightly combined and gives the bars a nice shine. Have fun experimenting with different combinations of nuts, dried fruits, and toppings! Almond butter works well, too!",

They taste pretty good however I felt like the pan size should have maybe been a little smaller to allow a thicker granola bar. It was also pretty crumbly and didn't hold its shape overly well. I would probably make them again though with just the smaller pan and hopefully being thicker with a slightly longer cook time would allow them to hold together better.",
