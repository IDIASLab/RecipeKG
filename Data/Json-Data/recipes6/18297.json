It turned out a little bit dry on surface but inside was okay so I will try lower degrees or shorter time for the next time. Recently using flax seed is a kind of my trend so I used 1/3 cup of ground flax seed. I skipped all-purpose flour and used 1 2/3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of oat bran. I usually make \"Bran Flax Muffins\" on this site and am looking for something another as healthy fiberly and tasty as \"Bran Flax Muffins\". I am glad to find this could be the one.",

I can't wait to pop a slice into the toaster oven tomorrow morning. Making the recipe I baked it for the recommended time and didn't have a problem with it being baked enough. I didn't have any almond extract so I added walnut oil (it's what I had on hand). I will make this again for sure! EDIT Crud! The -ends- were perfectly baked but the middle is still kinda gooey. DRAT! Like another reviewer said maybe it needs a longer time at a slightly lower temperature. I also think that NOT baking it in a loaf pan would help!! I'll still give the recipe 5 stars because it's a cook's error and not necessarily the fault of the recipe.",

It didn't sit as well with him as it did me I enjoyed this recipe. Yeah it's MOIST (maybe too moist) and dense rather heavy. It's far from seeming \"sin free\" to me lol. I drove up half the loaf to my mother in Indi this morning and she liked it. And she's not one to fib. I am not sure I'll make it again seeing how I'll be the only one eating it. There's too much going on in this recipe if you ask me. The ingredient list never stops and as I said it's heavy. At any rate it was fun venturing thanks Janice.",
