I was soaking wet, but I managed to get them off the grill and continued to cook them inside.  My plan was to grill the burgers outside (less mess on the stovetop), then bring them in, and finish on the stovetop.  My timing got all screwed up, and simply put, I totally overcooked the meat.  In spite of that and the way they looked (to make it worse, the bread slices were too small for the burger), they still tasted good.  I\u2019m a traditionalist when it comes to patty melts, and I used swiss cheese and marble rye.  I\u2019ll give this one another try one day.  My apologies for the bad photo.",
