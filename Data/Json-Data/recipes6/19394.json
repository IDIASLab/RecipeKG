I garnished w/ lemon zest & another sprinkling of raw sugar after baking. We loved this dessert & will have it over & over! I baked it in a 1 1/2 quart souffle dish & served it in parfait glasses but next time I will decrease the cooking time & bake it in individual ramekins. I'm eager to try this w/ limes too. And oranges. Thanks for sharing the recipe Chessette!",

I then placed the filled cups in a water bath & baked for 28 or 30 minutes.    Used Way more lemon than the recipe called for & also added some lemon zest.  It is hard to belived that something that only took 10 minutes to get ready to go into the oven could be so awesome.  It is like eating lemon pie.  I will make this again & again.  Am going to try with limes next time.",
