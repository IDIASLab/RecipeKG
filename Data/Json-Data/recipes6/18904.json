The one thing I would suggest to others who want to make these: if you are looking for a strong carrot flavor (more like a carrot cake), add more carrot than what is recommended. I used about 4 carrots from my garden (medium sized) and I found the carrot flavor was still a bit muted, especially paired with the strong cinnamon flavor of the glaze; so I would suggest using about 5 med-sized carrots. Also, I used applesauce instead of oil and found the muffins to be really nice and moist! Definitely a keeper recipe!",
