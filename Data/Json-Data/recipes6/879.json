Everything in this recipe was screaming for me to add cheddar cheese. I DID add the cheese but not until after I'd sampled it as written. The cheese didn't change much but I did prefer it WITH cheese as to without. This is definately worth giving a try to use leftover ham it simply wasn't our taste. THANKS for the recipe!",

I wasn't sure if the mustard was prepared or dry so I opted for dry since I didn't have brown. I used cracker crumbs and butter for the topping (no breadcrumbs) I also used probably 3/4 c more milk then called for. I omitted the apples as I thought the combination wouldn't work but after tasting it I think it may have added another flavour dimension. The flavour was interesting good but not like anything I've tasted before. I may make it again if I find myself with more leftover ham.",
