But I found it very easy to modify as I went along.  I like a chunky, fresh looking salsa so I added 2 diced vine ripened tomatoes and only put a 14.5 oz. can of whole tomatoes instead of the 28 oz., and drained and reserved the fluid in case I needed it, but found it wasn't necessary (I still used the 10oz can which gave enough liquid).  I only put in one jalepeno pepper since I was making it for a crowd with various tastes, and I found the flavor was still very present.  And I cut down the onion to 1/2 and the garlic to 3 cloves, crushed. Then I added the juice of 1 lime and a small bunch of cilantro.  No blender for me! I just diced everything. Good stuff!",

After reading the other reviews I added the juice of one small lime one bunch finely chopped cilantro doubled the canned tomatoes to 52 oz total added two large fresh tomatoes and ten vine ripened cherry tomatoes about three tablespoons of chopped green onion used only 3 cloves garlic and only one jalapeno diced into a near paste. Total quantity of salsa when I was done was 8 cups. Tortillas with lime were the vehicle of choice for the salsa (although I would eat it by the spoonful iif no one else was around)....so in conclusion it was YUMMY!",

If you want to turn down the heat decrease the jalepenos to 2 or seed the jalepenos after they cool down from roasting. I would not omit the peppers because the roasted taste makes the salsa. I have tried this recipe with less jalepenos and 'as is' because I was nervous it was going to be too spicy. I highly recommend 'as is'.",

I love roasting the jalepeno pepper (next time I'll use only half of one that's what made it a little too hot). I added some fresh lime juice cilantro and doubled the amount of cumin.

It was a bit hot but I think it all depends on where the jalapenos come from it does makes a difference if they are in a jar can or fresh. Even the brand name makes a difference.
