I usually add 1/8 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to my recipe. These biscuits are perfect for dipping in milk. My grandchildren love Zwieback toast as a snack as do our youngest children twins age nine! It is much cheaper to make these biscuits than to purchase them in the grocery store and tastier too. I use my bread machine for this recipe and it comes out wonderfully. The biscuits store well also. I am hoping that my daughter in law will have more babies so I will have an excuse to make more zwieback! I love this recipe!",

These rose a lot more than I thought they would but both kids (8 mo and 4 yo) love them and have been munching on them this evening. I did sprinkle a touch of cinnamon sugar on the cut sides before the second baking. Tried a couple with my tea after they were cool and pretty good. I will make these again for the kids since it was easy and they like them so much. Thank you for sharing your recipe and thanks to others for the tip about using the bread machine.",

I have tried every other kind of teething biscuit I could find and none came close to Zwieback until I found this recipe. SO awesome. Hard enough to really provide teething comfort and it doesn't turn into paste that is impossible to clean up like some of the teething biscuits on the market. This was definitely a project to make. First my dough balls wouldn't rise so I placed them in a warmer place. Also I didn't want to use honey since infants aren't supposed to eat it so I substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar. They turned out absolutely fantastic and now I have a huge bag of teething biscuits that will hopefully get my little one through at least a few teeth!",
