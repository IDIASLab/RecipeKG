I've made it several times: Once the way it is written, which was really good, once with bittersweet chips which was also really good, and once with bittersweet chips and an added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder with the flour mixture--EVEN BETTER!  It also tastes just great if you replace half the oil with applesauce for a slightly reduced fat version. Replace the eggs with a quarter cup applesauce and the milk with soy milk for a surprisingly delicious vegan version.  Very versatile, and exactly that \"boxed mix\" texture but with out the boxed mix flavor.  The batter may seem a bit runny but don't worry, that's what it's supposed to be like.  Also, don't forget to have boiling water on hand.  It won't work with cold water. UPDATE:  I have officially made this into Mocha cupcakes:  sub boiling H2O with boiling very strong coffee (or espresso).  Use semi sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened chocolate.  Deelish.  Makes aprox. 2 doz. or a few more. YET ANOTHER UPDATE: for some reason the wording on the recipe has changed.  It used to say \"1 cup boiling water\" and now it just says \"water.\"  This makes a huge difference.  I can't remember why.  I'm sure Alton Brown could explain it.  I just remember reading somewhere that this is crucial in some food sciencey way.",

After 30 minutes I checked the cake; it shook like Santa's belly when I began to remove it from the oven. I therefore kept it in a few more minutes and then checked it more. Still not done. This time the sides were more cooked but the middle was completely uncooked. Next time I checked it (after a few more minutes) the entire middle portion of the cake sunk! I let it bake until it was done but the cake was ruined. I verified that my oven temperature was set properly and that there's not a problem with the internal temperature setting. Overall what a disappointment. I'd say it was me but other recipes have turned out just fine. What's so distressing is that I live in Japan and ingredients are hard to come by and are expensive when you can find them... what a wate of time and money.",
