I wouldn't call this a casserole though.\nI chose to make this in my instant pot for an even faster dinner. It was as simple as saut\u00e9eing the garlic and onion in oil, adding the beef, and then mixing the remaining ingredients together and pouring the sauce over the beef. I cooked this on high pressure for 20 minutes.\n The only thing I would change is instead of using the dry mustard, use Dijon mustard.",
