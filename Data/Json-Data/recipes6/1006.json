It can shred and end up on your spoon.  Use a prepared deep casserole dish instead; 2) The cooking time says \"45 - 90 minutes?\"  Done times can be deceiving because you're using brown sugar, which is golden brown in color. This needs to be fine tuned and more narrowly defined.  3)  The cake mix does not get cooked through, so you end up with unbaked dry cake mix throughout.",
