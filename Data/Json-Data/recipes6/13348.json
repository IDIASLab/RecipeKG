The most aggravating part is that I never make pie and I made a homemade crust and even made leaf cut outs around the edge and then it didnt fill up the pan other than that the taste was good but I think I would rather have pineapple cream pie instead.",

I may try cutting back on sugar in the future for nutrition but the consistancy of the pie was perfect and I don't want to mess that up. One tip the strings of coconut and pineapple matter in the semi-firm matrix made this difficult to cut into clean pieces: it makes absolutely no difference to the taste/texture but if you're looking for a picture-perfect dessert for company pieces of this one do look more \"rustic\". A great pie to throw together from your pantry: thanks for sharing:)",
