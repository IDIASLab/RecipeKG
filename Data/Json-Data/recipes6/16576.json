Also, I just used enough butter to coat my pan once and I had no problems at all flipping any of the frittatas.  This was a simple, easy recipe and the frittatas came out moist and wonderful.      ",

I didn't know whether the 3 serving size was 3 paper-thin crepe like frittatas or 1 frittata cut into 3 wedges!  This is what I did....I only made 1 frittata, MASHED the banana and added to batter and poured all the batter into pan and cooked on medium heat for about 4 minutes.  The middle was not firm so I put under broiler (on Lo) for about 2 minutes.  I then slid out the frittata onto plate.  I turned pan over the frittata and plate and flipped over.  This was just to make sure the middle was done (only about 30 seconds).  I flipped back over, let cool and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\nI sliced into 2\" wedges.  My family gobbled it down!! I barely got one piece and my husband was asking if there was anymore.  I will make again!\n\n",

Typically, I don't use white flour, but I wanted to make the recipe as written, so next time I have a point of comparison.  I'll update when I use the whole wheat flour.  I did substitute virgin coconut oil for the vegetable oil and that was delicious.  Updating my review!  This recipe is delicious using whole wheat flour.  With the substitutions of whole wheat flour and virgin coconut oil, this is a very delicious and healthy breakfast!",

However I wouldn't make it again just because it wasn't that great. When it came time to flip I realized that the frittata was going to fall apart because of the heaviness of the bananas pulling at the batter from different angles. I loosened it from the skillet with a spatula and slid it onto a dinner plate. Then holding the plate directly over the skillet I flipped the plate over dropping the frittata back into the skillet to allow it to brown on the other side. Stayed together just perfectly. I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter and cut the oil in half (could stand to be cut a little more). I also used margarine instead of butter. Served with sliced bananas and powdered sugar on top. Thanks I had fun making this.:)",
