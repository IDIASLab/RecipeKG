        "description": "In looking for a recipe for scones that combined pumpkin and oats, I was surprised at how few I found. Since I have an extreme distaste for recipes that use just part of a can of anything, I made sure mine would use up the whole can of pumpkin. This one is lightly sweet, moist, and still pretty light. My kids love them. Enjoy them warm from the oven or freeze them and take them to work to enjoy with your morning coffee.",
