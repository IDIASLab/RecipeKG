Although I did use butter instead of margarine (that could be why people are getting flat cookies-I don't like using margarine-plus why skimp when it's a cookie) and I ALWAYS need a squirt or two of vanilla in any of my cookies. These had a nice and different crunch with the cornflake ingredient and they were very yummy! Will def make again. I also made half the recipe and that was plenty of cookies.",

I usually won't rate a recipe that I've changed but the only thing I did different with these cookies was that I used real butter instead of margarine and I used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 3. My kids and hubby LOVED these cookies. I also refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and that helped them from being so flat. I loved that they were so chewy.",

I added raisins and walnuts and they were so good. These cookies did not flatten when cool. Just the right texture a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I had to bake them longer, about 15 minutes was perfect but I made them pretty big. The batch was so big I couldn't fit it all in the mixer (Kitchen Aid), so I mixed the rest of the ingredients with my hands. I am going to try different variations. Like butterscotch chips and walnuts, no raisins. I am sure these will be in my cookie jar for years to come! Thank you.",
