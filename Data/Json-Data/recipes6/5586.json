I made a few substitutions: we replaced the cranberry jelly with leftover candied yams (pecans and all!), and rolled the dumplings in cornmeal after the egg for a bit of a crunch (it also helped them stick better). When serving, we put the dumpling at the bottom of the bowl and poured the soup on top.  I love the versatility of this dish!",

Mainly, just used more carrot, rutabaga, and peas instead of the green beans and poultry seasoning. I added some leftover gravy to the broth and it was so flavorful I didn't even need to use bouillon, just some salt. Lastly, the stuffing balls are time consuming, but worth it. I thought they might be weird, but not at all. If you take a teaspoon and squish the stuffing into it against the side of the bowl, it's easier and quicker to make them nice and smooth so they are easier to brown, and stay together better. Oh, and I didn't find that the can of cranberry added much to it, either way. Would probly skip that next time.",
