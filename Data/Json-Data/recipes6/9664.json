I made this recipe as directed.  I know someone mentioned in their review that they didn't really get a sticky glaze, but I absolutely did.  You just have to be patient with the reduction.  Also - if you are considering using dried rosemary that you have in your spice rack, I would implore you to use fresh rosemary instead.  Nothing beats the taste when you use fresh spices (in anything really.  In my opinion a totally different flavor than when you use the dried spices that come in your spice rack!  Rosemary has become one of my favorite spices but only when fresh and it's a wonderful addition in this recipe!!  Thanks chef John for a superb recipe!  This is definitely going into our regular rotation.",

Didn't have apple cider on hand so added 1/2 cup plain unsweetened applesauce plus 1 tsp. honey (didn't need to reduce the sauce).  We also skipped the mustard and red pepper because we didn't think the kids would like them (didn't matter - they didn't like the vinegar smell so didn't want the sauce anyway, but were perfectly happy with the plain pork chops).
