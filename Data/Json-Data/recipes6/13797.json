My major problem was it burnt my pan pretty badly from the sauce dripping off the rolls and as someone else said the sauce just melted off the rolls and would not stick so when I pulled them out of the oven I used a basting brush and basted the sauce back on. Not sure if I would make again just because of the mess.",
