So I went with the crescent rolls, cutting them in half once rolled. I had leftover cinnamon/sugar mixture and used that to top off the blueberries rather than making more of it. I lined my slow cooker with a liner and I'm glad I did since It is very difficult to get out of the slow cooker in one piece. I pulled the liner out with the cobbler and then used a large spatula to transfer to serving dish. I did have to reassemble it and then I scooped the blueberries and juices to the dish. The crescent rolls reminded me of churros. I will make this again trying it with the biscuits, even though it was delicious with the crescent rolls. Thanks for the recipe.",
