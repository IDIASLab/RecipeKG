Also I substituted sultanas (golden raisins) for the fruit called for in the recipe. I also omitted the nuts. The resulting loaf was beautiful to look at and makes an excellent Easter morning certerpiece. I do question the safety of letting the braided loaf rise for the second hour because of the raw eggs. Only let mine rise 30 minutes after the inserting the colored raw eggs. Everything turned out great. The bread is very lightly sweet and goes very well with coffee.",
