                "reviewBody": "Thank you for a tasty wing recipe! We really liked this. These are FULL of flavor! I did make some adjustments for our tastes. First I could only fit 1/2 the wings in my pan for searing, so I cut the butter (i did use butter instead of margarine) way down. I used 1/4 cup butter and cooked the chicken about 4 minutes on each side. I didn't need any more butter to cook the 2nd batch of chicken - there was enough fat in the pan.  In the sauce I used 3 serrano's but I did seed them first. I also cut the ginger down to 1 tbsp. I LOVE ginger, but I thought 2 tbsp might be too strong for our tastes. I did have the other tbsp on hand just in case to add it if needed, but I didn't use it. I reduced the sauce down until thick. It took a little longer than 7 mins though. Maybe about 15 mins but it was worth it. I think next time I will cook it down even longer for a thicker sauce with a stronger flavor.  Either way - we really LOVED these and will make them again.  The star of this recipe is the sauce - it is soooo gooood! Reduce it down until it tastes the best to you. I left out the msg and the sesame seeds too",

I couldn't find any serrano chile peppers so I used 2 red jalepeno peppers which were hot enough and I have McCormick ground ginger that says at the back 1/4 tsp is = to 1 tsp of grated fresh ginger which is stronger and so I opted to keep the same measurement of 2 tbsp using the ground ginger to give it a more potent taste and that was a great choice because these tasted really Asian and we love Chinese food out of all Asian food in the Bahamas. Tip for those who may not know to get toasted sesame seeds just place sesame seeds in a small pan by themselves (no oil or butter) on medium heat for 1-2 minutes until darker brown.",
