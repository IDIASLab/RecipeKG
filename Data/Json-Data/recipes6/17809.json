I used 1/4 cup of wine and 3/4 cup water. I used less wine because I only had red cooking wine and I know it is stronger and saltier then regular red wine.Update- I made this again and had everything except used Italian diced tomatoes and got brave and used the half cup of Red cooking wine and it was super - It makes the perfect amount of sauce.

When sauce has simmered (at least 2 hours) add whole pepperoni cut into 1/2\" pieces. When serving pasta ladle sausage and pepperoni separately and serve with freshly grated permesan cheese.
