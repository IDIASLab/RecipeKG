I tried and my cookies were completely flat. When I used the amount of shortening outlined in the recipe they came out perfect. I know that it usually doesn't make a difference, but if you use butter instead of shortening in this recipe you will regret it! When done correctly these are excellent!",

I don't know what almond brickle chips are--I just used the Heath baking chips in it's place. This is one of the best cookies I'VE ever had, and I don't even like Heath bars. Both my kids agreed with me. I made these a little biggish, using my small cookie scoop but making the scoop \"overflow\" a bit over the edges. 350* for just over ten minutes and they were perfect. I liked that I could just mix up the dough and make the cookies right off and not have to chill the dough. GREAT cookie. Perfect amount of everything.",

I used 11.5 oz bag of toll house choc chunks instead of chips and an 8 oz bag of heath bar pieces instead of almond brittle.  Wonderful, thank you!!",

Then i smelled the extract and chekced the bottle again. Made em anyways no white chocolate tho just semisweet and milk chocolate chips. They were just awesome. Reminded me of a subwaycookie. So will try them next time with white chocolate and some macadamia nuts. Update: made em with the vanilla. They were kind of bland will only use almond from now on. Update2: did this recipe change?",

However for my liking there was too much fat period and the resulting cookies were greasier than I prefer and not as thick. The flavor was good and the cookie is not BAD but I think reducing the total amount of shortening/butter by say 1/4 cup would be a vast improvement. As is the cookie turns out much like the Nestle Toll House recipe on the back of the package so if you're a fan of those keep the recipe just as written.",

He could barely speak between mouthfuls of fresh-baked cookies & a glass of milk. I followed the instructions as is but I used heath bar chunks instead of almond brickle. It produced 30 small-medium sized chewy cookes baked at exactly 9 minutes. I think it is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe too since I'm not a huge toffee fan. Thanks for the recipe Aimee!",
