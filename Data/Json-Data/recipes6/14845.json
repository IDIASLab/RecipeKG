I put S/P & Cumin on the steaks and seared the meat for about 1-1/2 minutes on both sides over a high heat in a pan with a little oil. I put them in my crock pot and spread some sliced onions, zucchini, red pepper and green peppers over the meat. Here is the clincher - I put a 16 oz jar of Peach Pineapple Salsa all over that. NO Water -you get enough liquid from the salsa. I cooked them on High for 2-1/2 hours. Oh my heavens does it taste good. It really tasted that good. Be bold and try a different type of salsa, if you like eating it on chips, you should like it in this recipe. I made rice to go with it - awesome.",

I eliminated the peppers because they don't agree with members of the family.  I added a can of mushrooms and also browned the meat first before putting it in the baking dish.  If your store sells the Black Angus cube steaks, I recommend getting those as they are usually more tender. I also didn't add any additional liquid.  I topped it with some monterrey jack cheese in the last five minutes. I served this with black beans and rice.  Very easy and delicious, I will make this again.",

I didn't have enough for the whole family!  So I added boneless, skinless chicken breast to the pan and covered it as instructed.  Delicious!  So this recipe works with chicken also!\r\n\r\nRecommend it highly.  Medium salsa seemed light on this - the kids didn't mention any spice.\r\n\r\nMaryA.",
