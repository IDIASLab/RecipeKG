I changed a few things to make it lower in fat and calories I used only two eggs and 3/4 cup sugar(I recommend only a half cup if you don't like too sweet). I used lime juice instead of lemon because I didn't have it and I also drained the yogurt for 48 hours oh yes I also used a boiling water bath to cook it in and used a small baking dish instead of a springform pan because of the small amount of batter. It definitely satisifes the cheesecake craving you'll never tell it's lowfat it's really creamy. I will make it from now on and try variations. Thanks!",

If you're looking for a lemon cheesecake with a crumbly texture (as if you added a little flour to the batter) this recipe's for you. The acidity and protein in the yogurt give it that. If you're looking for a custardy creamy texture and a neutral flavor you'd have to make full-fat cheesecake.",

It tasted to me more like an angel food cake and flavour still very moist although a bit more crumbly and heavy than I am used to with my cheesecakes. I was skeptical to try this at first but am very glad I did. I notice that many cheesecakes get better the longer they sit in the fridge and with this recipe that is most true! By day 4 or 5 I was in heaven it was so delicious! May try making with Splenda next time to save even more calories. Thanks!",

A water bath is also a good idea because the edges turned out to be overcooked. The cake was also extremely short...perhaps doubling the recipe could solve this problem also. it was a very good cheesecake couldnt even tell it was light.",

I guess because of it's rich texture I really thought this was cream cheese! 2) I mixed in little bit of fat free cream cheese. So it was 7/10 yogurt 3/10 cream cheese. 3) I used oreo waffles since that's what I had in my hand and of course without the cream filling it's only 30 calories for 2 waffles. Yay!! 4) I used sweetner in replace of sugar to reduce some more calories. Then I had some left over macademia brittle so I grinded some to blend it in to the yogurt mixture. Ok right now it's in the cooling stage but can't wait to eat them! I've tried but it's nice and firm!! Nothing like eggy with greek yogurts!! Thank you for the recipe!!! I will make again and again!!",
