You may want to try using 3 lemons, and slice them paper-thin using a mandoline (rather than attempting to slice with a knife). Can adjust the thickness down with the mandoline. If the lemons are sliced too thick, there's a bitter aftertaste associated with the lemon rind; if sliced thinly enough, the taste is perfectly tart...and a nice balance with the sweetness of the sugar. Also, try adding a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Also, MUCH, MUCH better by leaving the sliced lemons/sugar mixture to marinate overnight (stirring occasionally)...rather than just a couple of hours; greatly improves the flavor. Brush the top of the pie crust with a bit of beaten egg...will make the crust more golden-colored.",

She once served it at a dinner party she hosted; a week later she received a package in the mail, containing a solid silver pie server, and a note which read: \"For the best lemon pie I've ever had!\"  It was from a guest whom she barely knew.  Our version is a little different; it uses three lemons which must be peeled and the whites removed.   It is slightly more laborious, but it doesn't have to sit overnight; one can simply mix the ingredients and pop it in the oven!",

I love lemon but I would suggest to go with 2 smallish lemons or perhaps 1 large one (all of mine were much larger than tennis balls..). I didnt mind the texture like this - but I could still see it would be better if you put your mixture in the blender before you make your pie in my opinion. Using 3 large lemons this was extremely tangy but would be lovely if you put a couple of scoops of vanilla ice-cream with it when you serve it.",
