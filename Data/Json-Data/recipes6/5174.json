Make it just like a flour based roux except use GOOD quality paprika and veg oil.  Heat the about 1 or 2 tablespoons of veg oil, when it's hot not burning, add a tablespoon or two or paprika and cook it a bit to let the paprika release it's flavorful oils.  As your cabbage stew is simmering and hot add the paprika roux.  If it sizzles in the stew when added, then that's a great sign.  Stir the roux into the stew and it's done!  The added flavor makes cabbage stew even BETTER.   I prefer sweet red or lightly hot paprika in this stew.  Smoked paprika is good too, but I prefer the straighter sweet style.   NOTE:  We make a a very similar cabbage stew in both vegetarian and with meat, usually pork.   We don't use a pressure cooker, just a smaller stock pot, bring all the ingredients to a rapid boil, then turn the heat down to a sturdy simmer until the cabbage is tender.  To me fresh cabbage stew smells great.  I've made it using sauerkraut cabbage, and that one is a bit smellier.  :)  I prefer the sweeter taste of fresh cabbage in this stew.",

The only change that I made to this recipe was that I rinsed and drained a can of cannellini beans to make it a bit more filling.  Also, my cabbage was Chinese cabbage, since that's what was in my fridge.  My star rating is for how it tasted immediately after cooking it.  I found a little black pepper went a long way in improving the flavor.  This soup actually tasted even BETTER THE NEXT DAY, so I might give it a five star rating for the leftovers factor.",
