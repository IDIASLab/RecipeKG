I like to grind the nuts more to make them finer and not so crunchy! Spreading the batter on to the parchment paper is a bit tricky so be ready- I once added caramel to mine and it was fantastic....although you must be sure not to add all the chocolate! They call for TOO much chocolate i would use half the amount with or without the caramel!!!! I would def consider this a delicacy as you can not eat to many before you get sugar-outed! you can be creative with this recipe! I will def make this hundreds and hundreds more times...... Thanks for this recipe. The BEST TOFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! YUM YUM YUM!",

Maybe use a little less if you have a low sugar tolerence. Oh and a mistake i made was putting the chocolate on before the cookie part hardened/ cooled enough... yeah that didn't work all that well.
