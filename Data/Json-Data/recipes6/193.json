I did everything that was listed in the recipe, and the results were worth it.  Interesting.  I had a package of bacon that weighed 1.25 pounds, and half I used for this and half I fried as usual.  The ingredients for the candied part was just right for that amount of bacon.  The saltiness of the regularly fried bacon was so pronounced after tasting the candied bacon!  We had friends over for brunch, and the guys preferred the regular, but we gals loved the candied.  We were thinking of cutting the bacon in half, skewering it on pretty little sticks, and serving it for a party.  Trust me, it would be a hit!  Thanks again, as usual, Chef John!",

The candied bacon might taste really good, but I don't know, because it's been cooking already for about 1.5 hours and it's nowhere near brown and crispy.

I'm about to run out of brown sugar and maple syrup, so I might have to just finish baking it without continuing to baste, because I won't be able to make any more syrup mixture. Also, the maple syrup mixture keeps dripping to the bottom. More of my mixture is ending up on the bottom of my catch tray than on my bacon!",

I did not have rice vinegar (forgot it on my list) so I substituted apple cider vinegar with favorable results.  Also, putting parchment paper on my baking pan helped minimized the cleanup.
