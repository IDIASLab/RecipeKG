I used both in the spirit of following a recipe but when I took the dough out of the fridge it was really greasy and filled with pools of oil. I drained as much as I could by turning it upside down over another bowl and just wrapped each ball of dough in a paper towel before putting it on the cookie sheet and didn't grease the sheet. Aside from the oil mayhem (worked wonders for my cuticles though) (just kidding) the cookies turned out great! They were light and crispy and chewy all in one and not at all too sweet and entirely adorable. (:",

Because the dough is so soft though I found if I use 4 3/4 cups of flour the dough is a bit easier to handle and refrigeration isn't necessary. I always used to flatten the cookies with a fork in the old boring crisscross pattern used for peanut butter cookies. Using the thread spool just makes a wonderful cookie look even better. And since they say \"we eat first with our eyes\" maybe the flower design makes them taste even better too... LOL Thank you Jacquie for the great idea.",
