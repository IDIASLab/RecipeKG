Love the flavor that they lend to this veggie, but I will saute them in a separate pan in the future, as I\u2019ve typically done, and add at the end.  Cooked for 20 minutes, stirred, checked 5 minutes later because the house was smelling like something was burning, and the bacon and onions were black, sprouts were OK.    I\u2019m thankful that I lined the baking sheet with foil, because it would have been a mess to clean up that pan.  Also, I think this needs more olive oil to bake.  I will say that I liked the little kick from the cayenne, but it wasn\u2019t enough to entice me to make this recipe again.  Also, the pine nuts would have been better toasted.   Sorry for less than favorable review, but this was a disappointment, just didn\u2019t work out for me today.",
