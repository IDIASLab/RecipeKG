Unlike the German Apple cake it does not get too moist to handle properly. Unlike Apple CakeV it doesnt need a topping that sometimes makes it soggy.Is much moister than the Jewish apple cakes. I have made it 3times in the past two days (once by scaling down the recipe to half and baking in a 8x8 pan) and its turned out perfect each time. Of course I did make a few changes based on what previous reviewers said. I used only 1-3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil and cut the 4tsps of cinnamon to 2tsp. The best part is its easy and quick. While the kids hold the hand mixie and whip up the eggs and sugar....the apples are peeled and sliced..and doesnt take too long after that.\nThanks, Ann.....this is a winner!!",

After reading all the reviews I was certainly torn; sweet apple vs tart apple, nuts vs no nuts, 2 cups sugar vs less sugar, frosting vs no frosting. What's a girl to do? Well, this is so unlike me, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right. I used 5 large Granny Smith apples. I think a tart apple is the way to go. If you leave out the nuts, the cake is going to taste sweeter so you might want to adjust the sugar. And I can't imagine adding frosting to this cake, but to each his own. I served mine with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and got rave reviews from everyone. I will definitely be making this again and again.",

You could do it either way, but I love sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I will make this one many times over, and after one time I made a second the same day for company.  Loved this one!",

Next time I'm going to either chop the apples into smaller pieces use a less firm apple...I used Granny Smith...or slice the apples but instead of mixing them into the batter I'd like to try arranging the slices on top and then sprinkle them with the cinnamon/sugar mixture. Also next time I'll cut down a bit on the amount of cinnamon that the recipe calls for. We felt that the cake itself was overpowered by the apple slices and the cinnamon. My son enjoyed this warm from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream but after the first day no one seemed too interested in eating anymore of it. Thanks for sharing this recipe and I will try it again with the above modifications.",
