I used some sweet organic carrots which got a little punch of tartness from the cranberries and little spice from the cinnamon.  The carrots were so sweet that I'll probably cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting vegetable broth (open box in the fridge) for the chicken.  Mine were cooked perfectly in just 4 minutes, so watch your time because you certainly don't want them to turn to mush.  Thanks myvallie for a great new carrot side dish!",
