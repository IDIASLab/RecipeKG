I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer from another recipe and salted and baked the zucchini slices for a little over 10 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees. I compensated by reducing the salt in the cheese mixture but perhaps I didn't need to. I substituted frozen spinach for the parsley in the cheese and egg mixure. Turned out great. I was afraid of it drying out so I added some pasta sauce on the very top before baking -- about 1-2 cups to get a nice coating.",

I used a Julienne vegetable slicer to slice my zucchinis, so they were quite thin, and I didn't do any of that pre-cooking or salting them. 4 medium zucchinis made three nice layers with no problems, and I kept the seed slices in there also. I had some homemade marinara sauce, about three cups, so I used that with the diced tomatoes, and only a small can of paste, since I had a larger casserole dish. The instructions for layering are well written, so many lasagnas are confusing when it comes to the layers. Someone complained about the prep, but I did all that in the time the meat and sauce was simmering, a really good lasagna is worth the extra time it takes to prep. We really loved it and you don't miss the noodles at all...will make this one again.",

It was even better.  The third time, I added fresh spinach and sour cream (16 oz divided in 1/2)with 1/2 on top of each layer of spinach and spread over spinach.  The layers went like this: zucchini, ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce, spinach, sour cream.  Repeat.  Let me say that the dear husband and the cute little munchkins wanted more and there was none--I mean none-left for the week--which is what I was hoping for lunch leftovers.  I am thinking a repeat for next week!  Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I would also recommend using a mandolin to cut the zucchini so you will get even pieces. I used a peering knife as suggested and it was tedious and frustrating. I am not sure in what world would it take 30 mins prep time since it is all home made and you have to chop and cut everything including the spices. The sauce alone takes 30 mins of cooking time. Once was all said and done it was very good. If I were to ever make it again I would make those changes.",
