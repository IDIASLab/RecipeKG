We came up with this recipe, which was inspired by a pan roast dish we once had in a restaurant.  This dish is very versatile, delicious, and light! Serve with crunchy bread (whole wheat for extra fiber!), lemon wedges, or Tabasco sauce for an extra kick.",

I HAD to alter it to what i had on hand: pearled barley already cooked instead of potatoes I added some carrots that needed used. Other than that followed closely and Marci YUM! We went ahead and used the shrimp on hand. Usually my younger kids do NOT like fish but 2 of 3 ate it one saying it was delicious. It didn't LOOK really good but that was probably the barley and the mushrooms we added in. I had expected it more creamy but it was a mellow creamy texture and not chowdery. Overall VERY tasty and a forgiving base for alterations. Thank you.",

The recipe as it stands lacks the nice spice (even with the cayenne) and flavor that I enjoy in a great soup. So I added some Old bay seasoning lemon pepper season salt lemon juice and a touch of hot sauce (optional). I sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top and served with toasted garlic bread - delicious!",
