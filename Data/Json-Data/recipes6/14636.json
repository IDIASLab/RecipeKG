So with this one I omitted the sugar from the crust and only put in 1/4 cup powdered sugar with the cream cheese. This helped bring out the individual flavors of the different layers - the strawberries and glaze give it enough sweetness! Also brings down the calorie count. Also for the glaze I couldn't find Danish Dessert so I made my own glaze of 1 c. white sugar 1 c. water and 2 tbs corn starch - bring to boil so it thickens then remove from heat and add in 3 tbs. strawberry Jell-O. I didn't use all of it on the pizza either - just drizzled on as much as I wanted.",
