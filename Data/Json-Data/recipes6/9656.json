At first I was going to give it 3 stars but that is only because I believe the chicken could use alot more \"seasoning\" my usual fried chicken is very flavorful and has a great amount of spices which is usually the case in African American households. However since different people have different palates I would have to say the chicken is pretty good. I did season the chicken before I started the recipe, but none of the pre seasoning came through. I would suggest to heavily flavor the flour cornstarch mixture if you like a fried chicken with more spices.\nBy the way mix the soup with the egg and seasoning salt in a small bowl, have the chicken in another bowl, after your done mixing the soup with the other ingredients just dump it on the chicken and mix it together then put it in a ziploc bag wih the flour/cornstarch mixture and shake, same principle less mess.",

I do add some extra spices to the flour mixture, depending on my mood of the day.  I don't find it all that messy to make, probably because I'm a messy cook at the best of times.  I usually use a whole chicken cut up instead of just breasts, and toss the pieces in a bag to coat with the soup, then put on a rack over a cookie sheet to drain the excess for a minute or two before the flouring step.  Maybe that saves a little mess, but it also works quickly for me.  I'm usually cooking for 7 to 10 people, so I'm doing large batches.  The bags go in the trash, the rack and cookie sheet go in the dishwasher, so the little mess is no big deal.  Use tongs to handle the chicken, you can rinse them when the dough builds up on them and keep your fingers clean at the same time.",
