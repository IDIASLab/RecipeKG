After you dissolve the sugar, you need to continue cooking it over medium heat (without stirring) until it reaches 270 degrees.  Then, with your mixer turned on low, gradually pour it into the gelatin mixture until incorporated.  Turn mixer up to med/high speed and continue beating for at least 10 - 15 minutes. Hope this helps those who want to try their hand at homemade marshmallows.",

Before I added the hot syrup, I added 1/2 teaspoon orange extract & some orange food color to the gelatin/water mix. It whipped up beautifully, and I let it set in the refrigerator. They were great! I will make these in many flavors and dip them in chocolate for company.",

Then I cooked the sugar and water till soft-ball stage (about 230 degrees) about 5-6 minutes.  I added the sugar water HOT to the gelatin in my kitchenaid mixer and started to whip on medium until it was foamy(about 1 minute).  Then switched to high for 12 minutes.  The mix doubles in size and when ready looks like marshmallow fluff (marshmallow in a jar). Poured mine into a baking pan sprinkled with a one to one ratio of corn starch and powdered sugar.  All was perfect.  thanks to those who wrote comments in their reviews....",

The first time I tried this the gelatin sunk to the bottom like the other reviewers mentioned. I decided to try it again. I only whipped the jello for about three minutes the first time and I suspected that was the problem. The second time I tried this I whipped it for ten minutes. The mixture began to set up immediately. I poured the hot syrup into the gelatin (like another reviewer did) and by the time I finished whipping the entire mixture was already cool. I can't wait to try this with unflavored gelatin! This is a good recipe but the instructions were unclear.",
