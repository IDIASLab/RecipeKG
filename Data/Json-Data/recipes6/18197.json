I wanted everything perfect spent alot on decorating and then was forced to serve punch that one commented \"The color is appropriate for a baby shower because the color of the punch looked like \"baby poop\". Try using freshly brewed tea and let us know if it turned out any better than mine. And it wasn't even that good I believe.",
