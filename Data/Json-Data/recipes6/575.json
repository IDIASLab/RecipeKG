I did get exactly 3 dozen as suggested. The only change I made was using a stick of salted butter instead of margarine. I also didn't have to quite cook the caramel as long as stated. It was around 12 minutes to the 250 deg temparature. After the first 5 minutes I turned the temperature down to 4 and stirred continuously so it did not over cook on the bottom. I scooped the caramel mixture with a cookie scoop and used parchment paper to let them set and after dipping them in chocolate and it worked fine. The caramels hardened at room temperature but I had to refridgerate them to get them to set after dipping them in chocolate. I found that 6oz of chocolate is equal to 1 cup of chocolate chips. However I ran out of chocolate after the first 2 dozen and I shook off the excess well. Another 1/2 cup really is neccessary. They are a little too sweet for me but I think that with very many candies however I can see how most people would really like these.",

When I put them in the freezer they stuck to the wax paper even though I coated it with Pam. They got gooey really quickly. I had a hard time dipping them in the chocolate. They are not hardening up after I dipped them. The caramel/pecan mixture tastes good but not worth the hassle and mess. However I might have done something wrong?",

The reason this didn't get 4 stars is that there simply wasn't enough chocolate. I barely put any chocolate on the candies they weren't dipped but there still wasn't enough. If you are dipping these you will need AT LEAST half again as much. The other issue was my chocolate didn't melt so that I could dip them. If I was dipping the candies I would have liked to have seen the chocolate a touch more tempered or something. Just heating the chocolate was not enough. In short WONDERFUL caramel wonderful flavor but do your own thing for the chocolate. Oh and the time for making the caramel was close it too me just over 20 minutes to get to the right temperature but I was stirring constantly.",
