I used my meatballs (Meatball Nirvana) and a combination of linguini & fettucini as vehicles for this sauce. I'm lazy so I tossed everything in the crock pot on high for 1 hour then turned it to low (and added my already cooked meatballs) for the next few hours. Surprisingly we were out of tomato sauce so i subbed crushed tomatoes. I also had to sub red wine for white wine when I realized we were out of that too. I increased the crushed red to almost a teaspoon and it was perfect. I WILL make this again. THANK YOU for the recipe PAcklam!",

I omitted the green pepper only because I did not have any and I went easy on the salt. I only had burgundy wine on hand I used equal amounts in place of the white wine. I made no other changes. I paired this with Meatball Nirvana for homemade meatball sandwiches. EXCELLENT marinara sauce. I seriously can't stop taste testing it. This recipe's a keeper.",
