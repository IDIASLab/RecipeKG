When I completed the pudding, my Fiance, who knows rice pudding, could not understand why the recipe calls for so MUCH milk compared to the measurements of the other ingrediants. We looked in recipe books such as \"Joy of Cooking\", and found other recipes of six servings, with 1 1/2 - 3 cups of milk, and seem to be baffled to the porportions of this recipe. In a dessert dish, this voids about 12 servings, an additional cup of rice, and maybe double the sugar, and it would be much improved.\r\nHope this helps others :- )",

I did change some things though; I used 1 cup of long grain rice 1 cup of sugar 1/2 cup of whole milk combined with the egg mixture and 1 cup of raisins. It was excellent. I will definitely be making this again and again...... Thank you for a wonderful recipe that took me back to my childhood!",
