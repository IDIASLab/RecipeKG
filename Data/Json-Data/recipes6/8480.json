I love ranch dressing, but sometimes ranch seasoning packets don't taste quite right without being mixed in sour cream, buttermilk or something in my opinion so I made these today w/ italian seasoning in place of ranch seasoning & they were AMAZING. I don't normally give 5 stars if I change something in a recipe but these were too good to give any less than 5 stars. I cut back the oil to 1/2 a cup (only because I couldn't justify the calories for the full amount and these are so good I could eat every single cracker!) and used two packages of saltines and that was perfect for me. I will make these all the time, thanks for sharing your recipe!!",
