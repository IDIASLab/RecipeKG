I had almost all of a can of large pumpkin pie pumpkin and used that instead of the recommended amount of pumpkin. It was AMAZING. This is the best cake I have ever made. I have made it a few more times for other people and they all love it. I did have to let it cook longer though because of the extra moisture but it worked out well.
