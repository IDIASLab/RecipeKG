                "reviewBody": "I wanted this recipe to work so badly -- it looked like it would taste great plus the name is too good to resist. I had great results with the apricot filling by pureeing the boiled apricot mixture and patting it on the bottom 2/3 of the oatmeal mixture with wet fingers. However the oatmeal layers did not \"cobble up\" or \"cookie-fy\" (for want of a technical term) as I expected an oatmeal bar/cookie would. After baking the entire oatmeal mixture was dry and crumbly and the bars fell apart like sawdust as soon as lifted out of the pan. I think if I made this recipe again I would melt the butter with the brown sugar and boil it for a little while to carmelize it then mix it with the flour and oatmeal. This would probably lend a more cohesive texture to the two oatmeal layers and make them somewhat chewy but the cookie may or may not turn out as dear Beatrice intended.",
