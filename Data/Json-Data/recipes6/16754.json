It's not a highly flavourful dessert-it's puff pastry and cream! Simple and rich. Most of the major grocery stores here in Canada at least sell frozen puff pastry in pre-rolled sheets (I like the President's choice pastry). Thaw unroll and bake (probably at a higher temp than 350 degrees but read your package!). The pastry cream is simple to make and very good. I couldn't be bothered icing the sides just iced the top. I don't feel good about eating raw egg white and didn't have any pasteurised whites so mixed my icing sugar with milk instead-just enough to make it spreadable. Instead of using artificial colour I mixed in a bit of melted chocolate into the icing for my stripes instead (cocoa probably would have been the better way to go though consistency wise). Over all a very good recipe.",
