Hubby and youngest daughter are addicted to canned cream corn, but when they tasted this, they couldn't believe the difference. My older daughter can't stand creamed corn but decided to give this a taste. Guess what? Her plate had a huge helping! My cooking method was a bit different. I don't do milk and flour as I prefer to make a roux with the butter and flour. Used more corn as my packages were 14 ouncer's. Also added just a touch of seasonings, but cut way back on the salt. Gang came back for seconds and thirds. Thanks so much for a great recipe! Thanks to you too Tay~Tay and Cookie for your input!",

It is rich and creamy and I have yet to serve this to anyone who didn't love love love it. I however take time to do one more step, mostly for presentation purposes. After it's done on the stove, I heat the oven to 350 degrees F. and spray a 9x13 pyrex dish with pam. I then pour the corn mixture into the pyrex dish and sprinkle it with shredded parmesean so that it can brown on top. It makes it pretty. I let it sit in the oven for about 25 minutes to brown. Great recipe thanks!!",

Nothing special and not particularly good.  My friend and I tried to figure out why it was so bland - and what it needed to make it great - we just couldn't find anything to help it.  So, I added chicken broth, some sage and thyme and tomorrow I'll transform this into what I hope will be a Corn and Chicken Chowder.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think I can salvage it to some other purpose. Sorry, I was totally underwhelmed by this one.",
