Best cake of this type I've had in a long time. Okay so I confess I didn't sift anything. I did use a whisk to try and blend the dry ingredients but I'm no pastry chef so maybe that is supposed to do something but the cake was amazing anyway. I plan to use the glaze on other cakes. It set up pretty quickly and would work on many other cakes. I also think I may double the cake recipe but not the glaze next time and bake in a 9x13 pan. I think I may also try without the marshmallows. DISCLAIMER: I do not as a general rule like chocolate cake. That being said this one was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the recipe LEESON71!",
