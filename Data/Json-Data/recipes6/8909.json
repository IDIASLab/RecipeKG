I made it with the exact ingredients but in a little different proportion plus a little olive oil to mix with the butter when cooking the chicken.. I used a Costco packet of boneless skinless chicken breasts a mix of 4 tablespoons of ranch dressing and 2 tablespoons of Dijon and all the wine. It was very easy to put together and very easy to serve. He thanks you very much for the recipe!",

I did tweak it a little since we like bold flavors, I added blackened seasoning to the chicken instead of just salt and pepper.  Also I used light ranch dressing.  I didn't measure and estimated the amounts of dijon, ranch dressing and white wine in the sauce.  I probably added a little more white wine and a little less dijon.  After tasting the sauce it was really tangy so I added about a tablespoon of sugar to offset that and it was perfect.  This is such a wonderfully delicious and easy recipe.   We will be making it again.   Thanks for sharing.",

I tasted the sauce after making it (followed the recipe exactly) and it was so strong that I decided to add some sugar like Occasional Cooker did. It slightly improved but I still did not like it. My husband did enjoy it so I will make it again but will greatly reduce the amount of dijon in the sauce.",

This is a simple recipe to adjust according to your taste buds so keep that in mind when mixing the dijon mustard and ranch dressing. There's no way it shouldn't turn out if you taste as you go. I also got ahead of myself and mixed in the wine with the mustard/dressing mixture but it didn't matter as it still turned out great. Will make again for days when \"just\" chicken sounds boring!",
