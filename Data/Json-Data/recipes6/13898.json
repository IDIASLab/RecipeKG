First of all I put used 1/2 cup of sugar not a whole cup, and I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  I put all ing. (except the olive oil) into the food processor on high until well blended. I then turned the the processor down to low and slowly in a steady stream poured in the olive oil until blended and slightly thick. all I can say is WOW my whole family raved about this salad dressing. It is truly worth a try.",

Pulsed several times to incorporate.  I then blended on high speed, and slowly added the vegetable oil in order to completely emulsify so that the oil wouldn't separate upon sitting in the frig., and poured the mixture into a quart mason jar, covered, and sealed.  I am looking forward to my LARGE salad this evening with this wonderful, tasty, dressing.  THANKS Mary Ann for sharing this with all of us--reminds me of the dressing I ate as a child some 65 years ago.",

It reminds me a lot of those French-Catalina dressings that were all the rage at church potlucks in the seventies. I don't want to rate it too low because you may really like that sort of thing. Only a bozo (like me) wouldn't expect sweet with that much sugar in the recipe! If sweet orange-hued french dressing floats your boat you may love this. It just wasn't for us.",

Too grainy with all that sugar! You really need to emulsify it and let it sit in the refrigerator to meld. Next time I'll cut the oil in half and cut back a little on the sugar. But it was tasty. My dinner guests and family enjoyed it and yes I would make it again. It'a a nice addition to my repertoire of salad dressings. Thank you!",
