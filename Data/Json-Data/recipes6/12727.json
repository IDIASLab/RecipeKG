Mine weren't quite as runny as the others (maybe they had JUMBO eggs?). But they still made a disaster of my cookie sheets and only held up in the center. I'd probably make sure I had enough coconut and use a medium egg if I made them again. I'm not sure I wouldn't just try a different recipe first though. Shame - they seem to have potential... if you can figure them out.",
