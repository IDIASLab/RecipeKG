I've made challah a bunch on times, mostly using James Beard's recipe from \"Beard on Bread\"--a must read for the aspiring baker--and it never came out tasting this good.\n\nVirtually fail-proof...  The dough turns out smooth, kneading was a pleasure.  I used rapid rise yeast, yet Sy's estimated rising times still held (although I always recommend just eyeballing it instead of sticking to a rigid timetable).  A little extra sugar for my tastes (probably about 1/3 cup instead of 1/4) made this bread sweet, but not a \"sweet bread.\"  I had it with my eggs this morning.\n\nI would advise you give the braided loaves all the time they need to really double in bulk.  I thought my bread was ruined because right when I was ready to put it in the oven, some sensor inside the stove failed and it would not get hot.  Luckily my aunt lives nearby and I drove the loaves over.  So it probably rose an extra 25 minutes over what I anticipated, and there was no yeasty smell or taste to the finished product which has happened to me before with overrising. \n\nAnd I don't know what people did wrong to get a poor crumb.  The texture of this bread is impeccable.  And remember, challah is meant to be torn, not cut!\n\nBAKE IT.  EAT IT.  LOVE IT. ",
