If the dough is too hard you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk or melted butter.  This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.",

Fortunately (unfortunately for your recipe review sorry) it didn't go over well with my friends -- no one had more than a bite -- so to my knowledge they didn't get sick. The feedback was that it was too rich. Although the consistency was nice when it first came out of the freezer it got soggy relatively quickly after that. I used peanuts instead of almonds (that's all I had on hand). I thought the taste wasn't bad but I'm too spooked about the raws eggs now to ever make this again. Sorry.",

A few changes: I wasn't sure how much 5 oz of cookies was so I used about 2 c. crumbled (finger sandwich butter cookies from this site). Also decrease the cocoa by 1-2 T. You really do have to beat the egg/sugar mixture for 10-15 min. Lastly roll the whole log in sugar to coat before freezing. Yum!",
