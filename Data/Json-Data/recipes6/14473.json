I omitted the garlic and changed the soup to cream of celery (added fresh mushrooms with carrots, though), and it was a bit better, but still not perfect. I tried with the celery soup and no garlic, again, BUT added three tblsp. worceshire sauce (4 lb. roast) and THAT was the winning combo! \n\nEverytime I made the roast, I added over one lb. of baby carrots and two stalks of celery to bottom of crockpot. After 7 or 8 hours, I added bite-sized cut red potatoes (skin on) on top. Cooked 9 to 10 hours every time for perfect doneness of veggies and meat, as well as moist meat. Cooking on LOW is best.\n\nFor those who don't like cream soups, replace with a can of beef broth, add the worceshire, and dredge the roast with flour before browning. This will give you a grand, flavorful result, too.",

                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS NOT MENTIONED: If you're cooking this for 8+ hours with a 2lb chuck roast and adding potatoes, celery and carrots, I suggest adding 1C of beef broth or the whole can (2C).  A beef bouillon diluted in 1C of hot/boiling water also works.  I cooked the garlic in the oil that I browned the meat.  Have no idea why 16 was the magic number of carrots for her recipe, but I just put as many as I feel my family will eat.  Sometimes we add some onions ...sometimes we don't if our guests don't like them.  It makes no difference.  I definitely recommend adding a 1.5T of Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf.  I also sprinkle some McCormick's Slow Cookers Hearty Beef Stew seasoning package like other reviewers recommend when making other recipes on this site.  Big difference!  This finished sooner than I thought (4hrs - 2lb meat), but I continued to cook it until we ate dinner (10-12 hrs), and it just got better with time (but needed more liquid).  While there was still gravy in the end, there wasn't that much.  I spray PAM along the sides if it looks like it's burning, and it works like a charm!  If you use this for beef stroganoff over some noodles, you must add 4oz of cream cheese right before serving for it to truly taste like traditional stroganoff!  When I feel like having potatoes on the side, I use the honey potato recipe (1 lb red potatoes quartered, 1T butter, 3T honey, and 1t dry mustard - bake 40 min). My toddlers love this!",

It's really good if you use Campbell's Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup. Adds a little extra flavor. I have also found that the slower and longer you can let it cook the better. I have been rushed before and cooked it on high in my crock pot for less time and the meat comes out tough. This is a great recipe to start early on a Sunday morning for a delicious Sunday dinner!",

It was only 2 pounds so I searched for a recipe using a 2 pounder. Definitely use at least double the amount of carrots- I made it as written & wished I had used more. I also would cut down on the onion & maybe use the mushroom soup with either herbs or extra garlic. The cut of meat was totally lean- & fell apart! I took the suggestion of cooking for 7 hours & that was perfect- being that it is such a small roast. Turned out really tender & the amount of gravy was perfect. Thanks Erica!",

I had sliced up all the meat but after dinner returned all the leftovers to the crock pot with the gravy and cooked another two hours. Then it was nice and tender.
