The sauce never thickened I stirred and stirred for at least half an hour in the end I decided to add some cornstarch but still stayed a bit runny I did not want to add too much of it. After it cooled the color changed from creamy to brown buttery like. I used it anyway because I found the taste pretty good. I dont think I will try this again too much work for poor results unless someone explains what I did wrong.",
