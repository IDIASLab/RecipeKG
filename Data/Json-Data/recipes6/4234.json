Grandma had 3 slices!\n\nI used both lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix, and followed the suggestion of several other reviewers to double the tarragon. ALL good choices! The tarragon is refreshing and adds complexity, and is still subtle after doubling.\n\nI also glazed with a simple saucepan mix of butter, powdered sugar, and lemon juice. I poked holes on top so glaze could seep directly INto the cake, then spread any excess on top. The glaze added that TANG that I crave from a lemon cake.\n\nThis cake single-handedly won me the title of Official Holiday Dessert Chef in our family. No easy feat! Thanks Julie!",
