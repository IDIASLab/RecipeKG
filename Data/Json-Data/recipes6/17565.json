I replaced one of the green peppers for a red pepper for color. Next time and there will be a next time I would double the sauce recipe and add the green onion at the last minute in order to retain crispness! Thats the beauty of a recipe you can \"tweak\" it to suit your own taste! Thanks for this tasty and easy recipe!",

Couldn't find the chile paste or fresh chile peppers at my local grocery. So I used chili powder. I left out the sherry. The oranges were horrible at the store so I end up using McCormick orange peel (1/2 tablespoon) I followed everything else to a que and it turned out great. Not watery mildely spicy but does take extra time but worth it in my opinion. I served my dish with steamed rice and a Mandarin Orange Oriental salad I made. Will be making again..",
