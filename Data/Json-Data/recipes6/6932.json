It was less flavorful than I expected. No hint of the bacon grease flavor so don t know why it s in the recipe. The fish would have stewed in the liquid without it. If I make this again I will try it with sliced fresh tomatoes (maybe green tomatoes or tomatillos) with just enough liquid to cook the fish without drowning it perhaps white wine tomato juice or Bloody Mary mix. I would also add a spoonful of capers and maybe some olives. The is more a Mediterranean dish than Gulf Coast. I lived near the Gulf Coast in Florida and never saw fish prepared like this.",
