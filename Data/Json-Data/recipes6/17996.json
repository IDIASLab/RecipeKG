I made it anyway and now it is a demand for Christmas. It looks really bad when you're making it but don't be afraid. After it's cooked it looks alot better and tastes wonderful. I added a little cooked crumbled sausage. And I would definitely go to the trouble of making the cornbread as stated. Any store bought cornbread would probably be too sweet and ruin the flavor.",
