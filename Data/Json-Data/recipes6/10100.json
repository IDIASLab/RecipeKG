I reduced the temperature to 425\u00ba, cooked for 15 minutes, and they still were a bit overdone.  In the future, I will reduce the temperature to 400\u00baF and check for doneness at 12-15 minutes.  The sauce is very similar to the dipping/breading sauce up front, but that fresh lemon really gives it some tang.  These were good, just need to get the timing right for my stove.",
