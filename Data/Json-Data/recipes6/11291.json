Secondly I thought the cake would be a little more coconutty and light but the coconut was more for extra flavor and texture and the cake was a heavier and more crumbly than I thought it would be. The frosting recipe I had to change as I didn't have almond extract (which I'm sure would have tasted better) so I used vanilla extract. The result was kind of like what I would imagine marshmallow fluff to be like except more buoyant and light. Delightful! Making it was a bit difficult since I didn't have a candy thermometer--but I let it simmer for a couple minutes after it seemed to clear up after boiling (the test didn't work out so much for me--perhaps the water wasn't cold enough or the sample was too hot). Apparently I did it all right since I really liked the frosting texture (yielded quite a lot even though only one egg white was used--brilliant!). Since it wasn't what I imagined the cake to be I give the recipe but it was a lot of fun to make and my sister LOVED it and craved it for about a week after we first made and finished it. Great flavors indeed although a bit on the sweet side. I'd cut back the sugar in the cake and/or the citrus filling or else I would have it with a nice summery drink or a cold glass of milk!",

There's not enough liquid in the filling which would make it \"crunchy\" so I added about 1 Tbsp of water. I also didn't have anything orange on hand except extract so I used 1/2 tsp of that and water to make 1 Tbsp. I didn't let the frosting cool enough so it was runny when I put it on the cake but it did thicken up nicely. If it's not thick enough keep beating it - it'll get there.

It came out moist and fairly light. I doubled the filling reduced the sugar and used a combo of lemon and lime juice and zest as I'm not partial to orange flavoured desserts. I put half of the filling between the cakes and the rest on top. I poked the cake tops with a fork so that the filling flavour could penetrate the cake better. I skipped the icing altogether. The cake has a wonderfully light fresh taste. I'll make it like this again maybe serving it with whipped cream. The cake is a great way to use up egg whites and I'll use it again and try icing it with chocolate icing or something a little richer instead of the citrus/coconut filling.",
