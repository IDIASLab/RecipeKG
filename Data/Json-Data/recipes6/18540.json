There aren't a lot of ingredients to assemble and when you beat on high it only takes a few minutes to get a good meringue, and the piping was really easy too...I don't have a pastry bag so i just cut a corner out a zip-lock and used that, and it worked fine. The only real comment I have is that this recipe makes a lot of merigue. I guess you could make the mushrooms a lot bigger than life sized, but i'd say you could probably halve it and still get 36.",

The only changes I made to the recipe were in the assembly. After removing the caps from the oven, I used a pastry brush to lightly smear the cocoa powder, going for a 'wild mushroom' look. After they had cooled, I sliced the pointed tips off of the stem pieces to make them flat. One at a time, I painted melted dark chocolate on the bottoms of the caps with a small craft brush, then pressed the cut end of the stem piece into the center. As each one was finished, I placed them cap side down in empty egg cartons so they wouldn't topple over. I left them to dry for a few hours, then sealed them in an airtight container. These were perfect on our Buche de Noel, but I can't wait until next Christmas to make these again. I think they'll be great for Easter, too. Thank you so much, Holly!",

I like the idea of using colored corn syrup to paint polka dots and make 'fantasy' mushrooms; also to make the 'gills'. So sorry about the confusion of chocolate to use. The brand I used to use was Wilton Candy Melts. Now I like to use Giardhelli (sp?) dark semisweet chips melted. Note - I tried tonight to make these with the pasteurized egg whites you buy in cartons? They did not whip to the same stiffness as natural whites though the volume seemed about the same. Maybe a little less. They are in the oven now...I will report back on any major differences. But I am thinking one should stay with the natural separate-them-yourself egg whites. I'm back! the only difference I found between the whites from carton and natural whites - was that the stems from the carton whites did not quite keep their shape as well during baking. I tried to make them tall and they didn't quite stay tall. But still fine. I've tried some new final touches too - before the chocolate hardens on some I sprinkle the tiny colored balls to look like 'spores'...also on some I sprinkle finely chopped candy canes...and on the tops of large mushrooms I put a couple dabs of melted chocolate then 'paste' on 3 tiny nonpariels (\"snowcaps\" candies\".",

I melted 6 or 7 Hershey kisses and they did the trick perfectly.
