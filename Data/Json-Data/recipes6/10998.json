The smile on his face went from ear-to-ear and he said that the cake was as good as he remembered. My mom complimented me immediately on making the 7-Minute Frosting. She knew what it was just from looking at the cake. When my grandmother made this cake using egg yolks she would also make an angel food cake to use the egg whites. One day I'll try that. I now have to find a cake stand that will do justice to this beautiful cake. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.",

I baked it on a Thursday wrapped in plastic overnight then layered filled frosted and covered in marshmallow fondant on Friday assembled the tiered cake and served on Saturday. On Thursday and Friday it was very moist but had dried out considerable by Saturday. It was rather crumbly on both Friday and Saturday and did turn out a bit more dense than I was hoping even though I used a good cake flour and did not over beat. I would make this cake again but may fuss around with the ingredients a bit. It is a great egg yolk sink when you have them left over from making meringue (or swiss meringue buttercream frosting yummm). The flavor was very good.",
