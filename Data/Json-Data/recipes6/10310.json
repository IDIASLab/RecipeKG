There was no way that we could eat 6 loaves of bread before they went bad so after I let the dough rise the first time and shaped the loaves I froze the dough.  This was very easy, just once the loaves are shaped cover them in Saran Wrap before they are allowed to rise.  Then freeze them in a ziplock bag.  I've heard that you can keep the dough like this for up to 3 months, but I am really not sure.  When you are ready for a fresh loaf just unwrap the dough and place it in the pan, cover and let rise.  It will take several hours to thaw and rise, but it will.  A very easy way to always have fresh homemafe bread!",

It makes great hamburger buns, too, and rolls and the recipe follows exactly like it is written.  I didn't have quick oats, so I used some regular oats that I chopped up in the blender first.  Also recently I omitted the oatmeal and added 1 cup of wheat germ and one cup of wheat bran and about 1/3 extra brown sugar and it's great, too.  This recipe is the best. It's the recipe I've been hunting for. If you have trouble getting your loaves even, just roll the dough out in one long even roll and use a tape measure to measure it into equal pieces and cut it and then roll the pieces into loaves.  You can also rise this dough in the oven by letting the temp. get to 150 and cracking the oven door while you cook and then put an oven mit on the rack, put the dough in a bowl on top of that, cut the oven off and leave it for an hour with the light on.  Rise the loaves the same way cutting a long slit in the tops first and then when they're almost as high as you want, just turn your oven up to 350 and leave them there to bake for 30 minutes (cut 5 min. so the bottoms won't brown too much).  Make sure you leave room at the top of the oven so the loaves don't hit the top.",

It has such a lovely  texture and delicate taste, no doubt from the oats and brown sugar.\r\n\r\nI made the recipe as written but with the following two alterations:\r\n\r\n2 cups old-fashioned (rolled) oats in place of the 2 cups quick-cooking oats\r\n\r\n9.5 cups all-purpose unbleached flour + 0.5 cup vital wheat gluten in place of the 10 cups of bread flour\r\n\r\nAlso, I only baked one loaf today... after the first full rise, I shaped the dough into six loaves and stuck five into oiled ziploc freezer bags and put them into my deep freezer. I'll just pull them down as needed, let thaw and rise again, and then bake.\r\n\r\nThanks, J. Drury, for an excellent recipe--I will be making this often.",

I am not very experienced and am lacking in bread making confidence for truly homemade bread however I do very well with my 2-pound bread machine. Question: How can I adapt this recipe to use in a bread machine as far as adding the ingredients? The method recommended by my machine is to put all liquids in the bottom of the pan followed by the dry ingredients and finally put the yeast on top. How long would I bake it ie. what setting? Help!

Everyone loves the bread, with or without walnuts and chocolate- a bit of brown sugar sprinkled on the top is fun as well.",
