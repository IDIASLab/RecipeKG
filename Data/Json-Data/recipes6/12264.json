Will definitely make again!",

What I did differently this time was that after I'd poured the cream cheese mixture over the hot crust, I baked it at 300F instead of 375F. (My oven can get overheated than the temperature set. So, 325F should be good enough if your oven doesn't have temperature problem.) After the 20 minutes are up, I turned the oven off and left the pan of cookies in the oven with door shut for 1 hour 30 minutes. (But two hours should be fine as well.) This is what some people do when they make cheesecake. It prevents the cookie crust and cream-cheese layer from getting overdone. It also prevents the surface of the cheese layer from cracking. This yummy treat is best served when chilled. Enjoy!",
