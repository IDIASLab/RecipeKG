I bake them for almost 15 minutes enough for the bottoms of the cookies to barely turn brown. They turn out perfect every time. Not the least bit dry.",

My 4 year old daughter helped me make them until it came time to put them on the cookie sheet- at that time she couldn't resst eating the cookie dough and was kicked out of the kitchen.:) My husband said everything about this cookie was perfect and wanted this to be a regular in our house. I used m&m's semisweet baking bits and the cookies really looked \"cute\" with them. Like another reviewer said you can't tell when these are browned. I cooked them 10 minutes and when I took them out they were a bit mushy. However after sitting for the recommended 5 minutes they firmed up. They are a soft chocolately cookie and I love the oatmeal texture. I didn't know about cinnamon and chocolate together but the combination is wonderful! Really great easy recipe:)",
