The sugar makes it sweet and there is little chicken flavor. I told my first class to make as it was written suspecting that the sugar would make it sweet. I had the second class eliminate the sugar and some students added finely chopped onion and celery to the oil and sauted till tender and then when the milk was added we added 1 boulion cube. We also added the cornstarch because it was thin. The students really liked it. One group added Veg-all with the chicken and it also was good.",

I did use fresh garlic one clove. I think that I have gotten so used to eating sodium laden prepared foods that it's hard sometimes to get used to something that's not oversalted.
