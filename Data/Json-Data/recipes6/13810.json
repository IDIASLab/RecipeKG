As was mentioned before 8 potatoes was too many--I ended up having leftovers that I didn't use on the casserole (5 is probably a good amount). Also someone else had mentioned it was bland so I bought flavored tomotoes and tomato sauce (with garlic oregano and basil) which I think helped add some flavor. I will definitely be making this again!",
