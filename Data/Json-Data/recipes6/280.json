I had a huge pack of blueberries and the reviews were good so I had to try it...I shouldn't rate the recipe since I didn't stick to the actual ingredients but I'm rating the concept of the recipe which was was very good. I found a blueberry/ginger jelly which I used instead of the peach preserves and actual ginger. I thought the sauce was a little too sweet. I'm thinking the next time I make this which there will be a next time I will add half this jelly and half hot pepper jelly to up the spiciness. I'm sure you could use any jam/jelly you like. It was really quick and easy to throw together and a healthy meal. Definitely worth a try",
