I did make a change to it by using milk instead of water. I also tripled the recipe and used a 1/2 sheet pan to put it in which worked well. I will take this to many different functions just to watch their faces of delight when they try it! For Thanksgiving I plan to use the same recipe but sub cranberries for peaches and the cranberry jello as well and then in spring I will do it with strawberries. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us all!",
