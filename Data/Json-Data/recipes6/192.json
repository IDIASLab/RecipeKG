I held the garlic back only putting it in to the onions about a minute or two before adding the rest of the ingredients. That way the garlic doesn't burn and become harsh tasting. The 1 cup of chili sauce threw me. I can't imagine what chili sauce would be appropriate in that quantity. I used about 1 tablespoon of Siracha which gave it just a teeny hint of heat to counterpoint the sweet of the brown sugar and the sour of the vinegar. If you can't get Siracha you could probably use just a little by of cyan but don't leave the heat out. It adds that certain something that wakes up the rest of the flavors even if your fussy kids orGrama can't quite tell its in there. These flavors could stand up to a touch of ginger if your tastes run that way mine don't but I can see how for some it would work. Serve with mashed or something to sop up the cooking liquor. I happened to use wide egg noodles. My family is already asking when we can have it again. THANKS",

It tastes amazing and it got rave reviews from my guests but I personally think that the recipe makes a bit too much sauce and the sauce is a bit too thin. Next time I will: 1) Reduce the amount of sauce by 25% 2) Add cornstarch during the boiling 3) Add some pineapple. I will also clarify from the prior review that the \"Chili Sauce\" is a ketchup-like sauce sold in a glass bottle and it is only very slightly spicy. I personally prefer Heinz's product.",
