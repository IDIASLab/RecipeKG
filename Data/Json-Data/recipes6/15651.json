It looks great tastes great and I will surley be making this again! My filling was not at all runny like some of the other comments. In my experience using real butter when baking makes a big difference. Also my cream cheese was very cold straight fromt the fridge. The filling was thick creamy and ooooh soooo good.",

I had never done any type of roll cake and was pleasantly suprised that there were no problems rolling/unrolling the cake. I let the finished cake chill over night before tasting it. The cake was dense and had good pumpking flavor. I put a little pumpkin puree into the cream cheese filling. Most other roll cakes I've tried have a light fluffy filling. The cream cheese filling was very good but just a little too heavy for my taste. Next time I will spread the cream cheese filling a little bit thinner.",
