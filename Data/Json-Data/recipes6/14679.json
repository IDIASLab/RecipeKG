Just put in all the liquid ingredients then the flour (I reduced the amount to 2 1/4 cups) and then the yeast on top...after it has started to mix together add the candied fruit a little at a time. Most of it will mix in some may be left at the bottom of the pan. After the first rise remove it from the machine. Turn your oven on to 200 degrees for 5 minutes - then turn it off. Knead the dough a little to get all the fruit in - the dough should be soft and a little sticky - don't add to much flour it will make the final product stiff and dry! Then roll it out and put in the marzipan just like the recipe says. Put it in the warmed oven to rise - I guarantee it will rise up beautifully - as long as you haven't added too much flour! It is a wonderful recipe!",

It's great!\n\nA few tips for people first setting out:\n1) Marzipan contains almonds, so take care if you or anyone you make it for has nut allergies.\n2) This makes a HUGE stollen. When the recipe calls for folding the halves it over onto one another, instead put each half on its own tray (or well separated on a large baking pan) and make two in one go.\n3) Sprinkle icing sugar on the stollen just after you pull them out of the oven - don't wait! The heat from the dough will be sufficient to melt the sugar and create a sugary 'crust' instead of just powder.",

I use orange peel lemon peel and citron and I don't use candied cherries. Christstollen is baked throughout the Christmas season in Germany and it is tradition in some parts of the country to eat the last one on Easter - and that was before modern refrigeration (no freezers)! The way this was accomplished is in how the loaf is finished. While the loaf is still warm you brush it with copious amounts of melted butter. I would recommend 1/4 cup butter for this one loaf. It is then THICKLY coated with powdered sugar. This process keeps all the moisture inside the loaf as well as adding wonderful flavor. The reason for the shape of the Stollen loaf is that is to represent the Christchild in swaddling clothes. I shape the loaf by first spreading the dough into an oval shape about 6 inches by 14 inches. If I am using marzipan as in this recipe I lay the log near one edge then roll that long edge over the marzipan gathering the sides in slightly then rolling to about 1 inch away from the other side pressing gently. Stollen is a wonderful accompaniment to coffee or tea and it wouldn't be Christmas in our house without it! Merry Christmas!",
