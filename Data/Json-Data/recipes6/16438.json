I also couldn't bear to put two sticks of melted butter onto the pretzels, I only used one (1/2 cup).  But the recipe was a hit!  It was a nice, light and refreshing summer dessert.  The combination of the sweet and salty was yummy!  I will definetely be making this again.  And I told my girlfriends to find it here on Allrecipes.  Thanks for sharing it.",

The pineapple in this recipe compliments really well with the other ingredients and it does not have a really strong pineapple flavor, it really is a nice blend of ingredients.  The other thing I wanted to mention about the recipe was the fact that I was confused about the vanilla pudding mix.  You DO NOT make the pudding, you just mix in the dry mix with the pineapple.
