I added carrots for crunch used regular Bok Choy since I didn t have baby and also followed another suggestion and added the noodles to each portion because I anticipated leftovers. I added the flavor packet to the soy mix for flavor and poured over the cabbage early to soften it up a bit. Overall it was very good but needed something to give it some oomph to make it memorable. Perhaps some red pepper flakes or some lemon or lime zest? Would make again.",
