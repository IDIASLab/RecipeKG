Very happy with subtle mango flavor.  \n\u2022 Used SALTED BUTTER to compensate for not seeing salt in the recipe (I used 1/3cup as indicated was good)\n\u2022 Also I MIXED INGREDIENTS BACKWARDS; starting with the egg, butter, brown sugar then adding in the flour mixture, strained mango \"mess\" and after blending very well, folded in sliced bananas -- the result was that I had some banana patches in the muffins,YUM!\n\u2022 Coated muffin pan bottoms with OLIVE OIL instead of cooking spray and no burns!",

They turned out perfectly!  18 standard sized muffins, not too buttery at all and a delicious texture.  The lime glaze really sets these muffins apart!
