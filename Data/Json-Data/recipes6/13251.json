I used 3 oz of chocolate and 1/2 cup malt powder (added the powder to the pudding before cooking) and substituted half & half for 1/2 of the milk and it was the best silkiest pudding I've ever had and others told me it was the best they ever had. However even with 1/2 cup of malt not real malty. Next time I'd use the 4 oz of chocolate like the recipe says.",
