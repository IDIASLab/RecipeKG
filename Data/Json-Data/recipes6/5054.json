The only change I made was using chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (I'm not a vegetarian). Also, I added a teaspoon of salt. Other than those two things, I kept everything else the same. I will definitely use this recipe again because greens are healthier cooked without fatty meat. My family loved them (and none of us are vegetarians)!",

I had to substitute pear infused balsamic vinegar. I wanted a little more sweet, so I stirred in two tbsp of pepper jelly. \n\nIt was New Year's, so I threw in some black eyed peas in the last 20 min.\n\nThis was the main course for us. I put mine in a bowl and topped with two eggs over medium. For my wife, I beat three eggs and poured into a hot small skillet. Made an egg tortilla, topped it with a little BBQ, and mounded the smokey greens on top.",
