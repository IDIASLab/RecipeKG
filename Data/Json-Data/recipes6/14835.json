                "reviewBody": "Looking to use a small amount of chocolate buttercream frosting I had leftover from another baking project I wanted a brownie recipe to use in mini muffin cups. Too lazy to melt chocolate I also wanted a recipe that used the easier to deal with unsweetened cocoa powder. This one caught my eye for its addition of corn syrup in the batter something you don't often see. I scaled this down to 6 servings which fit my 12-mini muffin pan perfectly. In my mind there's not a whole lot to say about a brownie - it's pretty much either a good recipe that works or a not-so-good recipe that doesn't. While the results quite possibly would be different baked in a traditional baking pan rather than these mini muffin cups I was quite pleased. They're moist provided they're not overbaked and medium chocolate. They're not too rich which I liked in this case because I finished them with the chocolate frosting. Cute as a button! And this recipe was easily adaptable for the purpose I intended them for.",
