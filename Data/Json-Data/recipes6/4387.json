For those of you who find variations on this recipe bland, it is important to note that you **must** use Basmati rice to make this dish, as the Indians do.  Basmati has a fairly rich, nutty flavour that contributes to the delicate spice flavours.  If you are making this with regular long grain rice, yes it will be bland to some. Basmati is available in the foreign foods section of most North American grocery stores.  Also one could probably stand to cut the butter down a bit if one were trying to cut calories out of this dish.",

I used the recommended Basmati rice.  I don't think it's been mentioned yet that Basmati rice benefits from being rinsed a couple of times with cold water before being cooked--it cleans off the talc that is added for shipping and storing.  I've found Basmati rice in the ethnic section of the discount-foods type grocery stores or in any Arab/Indian specialty stores.  BY THE WAY, the Saffron was 1/2 the price at an Indian Store than it was in an American grocery store...worth the search!   ",
