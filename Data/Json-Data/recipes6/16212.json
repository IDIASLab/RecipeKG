I was a little skeptical about this recipe because I wasn't sure how the beef would turn out...(I rarely fry anything), but I was in total shock when I tasted how good this was.  I know this is just as good as the crispy beef I've ordered at a local chinese restaurant around our area.  I didn't use fresh ginger...only powdered and instead of the chili paste, I used hot chili sauce.  I thickened up the sauce with a little cornstarch at the end since mine was a bit watery. But other than those few changes, I pretty much followed the directions.  I highly recommened this recipe!!",

I did make a few changes in the sauce as follows: I used 3 tabsps of light soy sauce and 1 tabsp dark soy sauce. I left out the rice vinegar and just used rice wine vinegar instead. Also 7 tabsps of sugar seemed too much and I only used about 2. This is a really good recipe and has become a favorite in our house",

I like this better than my local restaraunt!! Instead of the red pepper i used a few whole dried chili peppers (They are easy to find in any grocery store). I stirred in some shredded carrot right before I served the dish(That's the way the locals do it). It makes it colorful and yummy. I accidently added more honey (2 Tablespoons instead of 1.5) but it was still awesome. Use fresh ginger and garlic. Dont use the pre-processed junk in the jars. The only other think I did was remove some of the garlic and onion chunks after I had cooked the sauce for about 10 minutes. This makes it a little less spicy (better for the kids) YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Used green onions grated the ginger into the sauce added hot pepper flakes to sauce stir fried broccoli with the peppers and onions and added cashews at end. Made a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. I would have liked more sauce and probably because I added broccoli it needed more sauce. Will probably make 1 1/2 times more sauce next time. Thank you for this recipe. We live out boonies and have had no luck finding a decent Chinese restaurant. My fiance said this was 10 times better than any thing we ate in a Chinese restaurant here.",
