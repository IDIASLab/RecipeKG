Also like a few of the other reviewers I did not use the bamboo fungus or lilly buds. I substituted bamboo shoots for the fungus but found out afterwards that bamboo fungus is actually a type of mushroom that grows on bamboo. You can find it at an Asian grocery store - it is dried looks like pasta noodles and is called \"long net stinkhorn\". Also if you did not already know to make the soup \"crackers\" that are served in Chinese restaurant get some wonton wrappers (I found mine in the frozen section of the Chinese grocery store) - these thaw quickly and are doughy shavings that fry up very quickly.",

The bamboo fungus is a MUST in this recipe and so is the white pepper. It does make all the difference. The bamboo fungus can be found in the dried mushroom section of the Asian market because it's really a type of mushroom. You can find all the ingredients for this recipe at your local Asian Pacific market with assistance from those that work there. Will become a staple in our home.",

Next time I make it I will use low sodium soy sauce and if that works I'll try to cut back on it the following time too...the sodium content in this soup (and every hot and sour soup recipe I've looked at so far) is too high for everyday consumption.  I noticed that the non-vegan recipes for this soup include pork...the Chinese restaurants I've been to do not include pork in their hot and sour soup (at least not as far as I can tell).
