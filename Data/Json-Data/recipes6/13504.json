It is not fancy enough for holidays; I think the appearance and texture are more suited for every day. I do agree with one review about the egg taste although it wasn't bad! When I make this pie again I am going to try and use one less egg an additional 1/4 cup of baking mix an additional 1/4 cup milk and an additional tsp of vanilla.

The flavor was good...not overly sweet but I think it needs a thicker consistency. If I were to make it again I think I'd add more bisquick because the pie was barely an inch thick.
