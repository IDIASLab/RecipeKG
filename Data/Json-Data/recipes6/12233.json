I doubled the cherry weight (8 oz) and adjusted the nuts to Hazelnuts because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't add the icing either. But it was still amazing put together. I think I will adjust the sugar down by 1/4 cup in the topping, but I like desserts which are less sweet. I also made most of this in my food processor which made the whole thing faster.",
