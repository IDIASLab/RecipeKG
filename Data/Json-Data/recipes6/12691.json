I agree that they are not good for drop cookies I rolled them out with a pin and used cookie cutters. They turned out great and taste really good with frosting and decorations. I will be using this recipe for christmas cookies. For the people who say they are bland they are not bland but not really sweet however that is what the frosting is for. Too much sweetness is overwhelming I think with a sweet frosting it gives a nice balance.",

For the holidays I pressed them with a glass dipped in colored sugar and flattened. Mmmmm. I was also told that when you bake you should use unsalted butter so thats what I used. Next time I'll try with regular butter. They couldn't have tasted any better. Thanks for the delicious cookies. I have my husband at my mercy now!!!",

I took half of the dough and rolled it into cinnamon sugar for a cookie like a snickerdoodle. I used the remaining dough and decorated it with buttercream frosting and sprinkles. Original review: This cookie rivals if not beats the store bought \"fluffy frosted sugar cookies\"...IF you know what you're doing and how to make them right! Instructions: Do NOT melt the butter at all. You want to let it soften at room temperature. Then cream it w/ the sugar & add eggs one at a time. Next you need to sift the flour into your measuring cup! This is NOT the same as measuring then sifting (trust me I know what I'm talking about!!!) Once you've thoroughly combined the flour add the baking powder & vanilla. I chose two slight changes: I used 1/2 tsp almond extract & 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Then I bumped the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. I used a small spring hinged ice cream scoop to distribute the dough. Don't allow the 1 star ratings to sway you - if you know how to cook and understand your way around the kitchen give this recipe a try!!!!!",
