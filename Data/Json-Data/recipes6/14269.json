I checked the candy at 6 9 and 11 minutes to make sure it was not burning then cooked one minute longer added the butter and vanilla and cooked 2 minutes longer added the baking soda and poured it out to cool. It turned out perfectly! What I did differently and I learned this last year making another microwave candy recipe is this: I use a fairly heavy large pottery mixing bowl to make candy in. Something like Pyrex will not work as well and often causes the candy to burn.",

I cooked it for only 6 min, THEN added the peanuts with the butter and vanilla.  Cooked it for another 4 minutes....tested it with the old water trick then added the baking soda...Much Better....BUT....not nearly enough peanuts.
