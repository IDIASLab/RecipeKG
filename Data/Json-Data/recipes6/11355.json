This will give your cannoli cream the texture you want. Just put cheesecloth, a few layers thick, into a strainer or colander, put your ricotta into it (make sure you have it in a bowl to catch the water), and let it drain for an hour or so in the fridge. You should get a nice, dense consistency to the ricotta.",

I too found the filling to be a bit too runny so I sprinkled some white chocolate pudding (instant) into the mixture until it thickened to a spreadable consistancy. This also gave it another dimension of flavor. (I did the pudding \"trick\" the second time I made the cake. The first time I increased the amount of cream cheese to 8oz which also helped--but the pudding \"trick\" works the best!!) I'll definitely make this again and again.",

Brush the flavored sugar and liquor mixture lightly. just enough to cover the cake. you may have some juice left over. not too tight on rolling it up. i rolled mine up from the short side. (end zone of a football field) ricotta should be full fat and not part skim. you should strain the cheese by placing it in a small strainer then hover it over a bowl and cover the top with paper towel and place in fridge for as long as you can. i prepped the cake with the cheese and left it in the fridge (rolled up) until the next day. then added the whipped cream before serving. (the cake takes up a lot of room in the fridge) it was a fab desert. thanks so much",

I had a feeling that it would turn out perfect after reading all the great reviews about it. But instead I'm very disappointed. After I wrapped the cake in the towel and waited for it to cool for exactly 1 hour I gently unrolled it and the middle of the cake stuck to the towel which then made a hole in the cake. I did use confectioners sugar before inverting it onto the towel so I don't know what the problem was with the cake sticking. And another thing was that the cannoli filling was not at all thick enough from sitting in the refrigerator by the time the cake had cooled for an hour. It should have sat in the fridge for at least a couple of hours. But in the end even when the cake did come out looking bad I ripped the cake apart and put the pieces in dessert bowls and poured the liquid cannoli filling on top. It did taste good so that's why i gave it one star.",

I followed the recipe very carefully but I would recommend making sure that the crowd you serve it to enjoys cannolis or they might not be too impressed.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this cake a week before Easter and froze it without the whipped cream frosting. Instead of using cream cheese I used 4 oz.(1/2c)of mascarpone cheese. I also chopped up 1/4c of shelled pistachio nuts and added them when I folded in the mini-chocolate chips to the filling.When I sweetened the whipped cream I also added 1/2 tsp of grated orange zest. I thawed the frozen cake the day before Easter in the Refrigerator and then frosted and garnished the cake on Easter morning. It sat in a cooled garage covered for three hours before serving and it was a big hit. My Son-in-Law said it was \"absolutely delicious\". I will make this again and maybe add drained paper-towel dried and chopped-up maraschino cherries to the filling also then it will really taste like my Grandma's Cannoli filling. Thanks for the great recipe! P.S. They have asked me to make it again when Family comes into town at the end of April. I know this will be a crowd favorite for years to come!",
