I recommend increasing the amount of shredded cabbage though because it wilts down a lot.  I did cut the amount of salt by half and the pepper by half.  Velveeta is hard to shred so I cubed it and it melted in nicely.  I used turkey Italian sausage and ground sirloin.  The stuffing was moist without being greasy.  It makes a lot so I froze some and I'm looking forward to eating it again soon.  For those who haven't made bread, the shortening should be melted, cooled to lukewarm, and added to the yeast and water mixture before the flour.\r\nI will make this again.",

I did end up having to add nearly an extra 2 cups of flour to bring the dough together and also added a tspoon of salt because I can't imagine a bread dough without salt but other than that I followed the bread recipe. I did end up altering the meat mixture after tasting it to suit it to our tastes but these were such a hit at the Oktoberfest party I attended. Here's what I did: grab about a 2\" ball of dough flatten it and gently stretch it to about 4\" or 5\" in diamter. If this dough has been kneaded enough you shouldn't have to worry about it breaking open but don't push it. I put a very large spoonful of mixture in since the reviews all said they had a ton of filling leftover. You can add more than you think because the dough stretches nicely around it and I didn't end up with any extra filling (though I did cut down the filling ingredients slightly). AFter adding the additional 2c of flour I'd say I was able to make about 2 batch of 8 or 9 & because the bread expands quite a bit during cooking they turned out to be the size of a good sized burger w/ a beautiful bread to filling ratio. Brush the top with an egg wash (egg white and a quick splash of water) and sprinkle with a dash of sea salt and something like dried onions or Mrs. Dash for color and texture and appearance. Can't wait to try this one with different fillings; I think I'll try an orange egg wash mixture and make pumpkins for Halloween!",

I added more mustard (dijon type) and more cheese (white cheddar). Other than the sticky dough, these were fantastic! Next time I will do the dough by hand (probably for best results anyway).Even my mom and her friend who have published 8 cookbooks between the two of them (one being a bread baking book) thought these were outstanding!Thanks for sharing, Kim!",
