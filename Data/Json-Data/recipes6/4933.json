I subbed the kale for spinach and reduced the chipotle powder to 1/4 tsp because my five-year-old has very little tolerance for anything spicy. I also used bowtie pasta made with veggies because I didn't have any rotini at hand. I didn't have any garlic salt either, so I used two tsp sea salt and subbed the regular olive oil for garlic olive oil.\n\nIt was fast and yummy and I will be making it again!",
