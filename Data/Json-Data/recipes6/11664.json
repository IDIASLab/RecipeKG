After you bake the cake part of it, let it cool a minute or two while still in the pan.  Loosen edges and then turn pan upside down over your powder-sugared towels.  When you roll it up, ROLL THE TOWEL IN WITH IT.  This is where my problem was.  I have never made a jelly roll or roll-up dessert and didn't know.  Also the cake was too warm and it fell apart.  I'll know better next time!",

The only difference in my recipe is you fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture just untill blended, don't overmix, and the baking time is 375 for 15 min. I bake in a 15x10x1 in.sheet. Can use walnuts instead of pecans. Do not panic if cake cracks when you unroll to fill(don't roll too tight) this is common. Just lightly press together and sprinkle with lots of confectioners sugar and no one will notice! Everyone raves over this! You must try! Oh I forgot, this freezes well too! Thanks Tammy!",

                "reviewBody": "I just made a \"practice\" pumpkin roll. It came out fantastic! I did use wax paper to line the pan. When it was done, I used a knife along the edges to loosen the cake from the wax paper. I carried the cake with the wax paper attached to the counter. Holding onto the wax paper extending from the sides, I slowly rolled it up. The cream cheese filling was easy to make. After the cake cooled, it was easy to unroll (with the wax paper still attached)..I spread the filling then rolled it back up, peeling the wax paper off as I went. Hubby asked why it doesn't break and I think it's the texture of the cake that helps. It has a denser texture than a traditional layer cake.That, in addition to rolling it while it's warm is the key.  I've been thinking of making one of these since Junior High Home Ec class where the first one I saw was made by Mrs. Griffith. So, if you have been thinking of tackling making a cake roll, I highly recommend this recipe. It's a great place to start! (and very delicious, too!)",
