We're really happy we did!  \nWe allowed the chicken to marinade in the buttermilk-hot sauce for 8 hours before dipping and used cornstarch instead of tapioca flour.  \nSeasonings were fine but some people would likely want more salt.\nI used parchment paper with a bit if oil to line the baskets and sprayed the dipped pcs with oil just before cooking.\nThe Air Fryer is a perfect way to cook these.  My new oven has an Air Fryer feature so we did some in the Air Fryer and most in the oven using the Air Fry mode.  The OVEN needed a temp of about 425\u00b0f to get the same level of cooking as the air fryer did in the same time.  With these changes, the results were great and definitely worth adding to our menu rotation.\nTonight I'm going to reheat using the air fryer to crisp up the last of the leftovers.  I'm expecting another great meal.",
