This is the first eggless cake recipe I'll keep.  I've tried it twice so far.  Best results were when I doubled the recipe and substituted 1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of  baking powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt for each cup of self-rising flour.  A double recipe fills my NordicWare mini-bundt muffin pan, plus a couple of small mini-bundts.  The texture was more solid and consistent than recipes that use soy lecithin or potato starch/tapioca substitutes for egg.  The cinnamon masks the baking powder flavor just fine.  I'm going to try a chocolate version next.",

Ever time i made it, it would be gone within a half an hour, so i turned it into a two layer cake and made a topping for it by making a third cake and crumbling it up mixing it with a stick of butter, a 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It was just what the cake needed. It made it taste a thousand times better. Everyone raves about this, it was a huge hit at work! and very very simple",
