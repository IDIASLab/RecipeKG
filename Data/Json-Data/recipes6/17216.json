(PS If like me you don't want to buy large and expensive amounts of spices you don't use very often check out your Indian grocer - I buy a 1.5oz bag of Mixed Spices including cinnamon sticks cardamon cloves star anise and peppercorns for 1.59.

I replaced the fennel with fennel seed the star anise with anise extract and the cloves with allspice. Original recipe says it makes 16 servings - so figure ea serving is approx 1 T. I tripled it without a problem. I also put everything in my crockpot on high until it was heated through. then on low WITHOUT a lid - cooked it overnight then put everything through a sieve in the morning and back into the crock pot on low until I had the desired thickness I wanted. I plan on making it again over the winter with the tomato juice I canned this summer. Ummm.",

The result was a great tasting ketchup with a full-bodied country ketchup flavour--better than the commercially bottled stuff. The second time I made it I actually had the requires star anise and made the recipe extactly as indicated. The result was that the anise flavour was not subtle enough. If you like that flavour in ketchup then it's a very tasty sauce. Personally I prefer my first version without the star anise but with a few drops of the extract.",
