I used fresh pineapple instead of canned crushed. I added some water with a bit extra sugar since I didn't have the syrup from the canned pineapple. Also I cut the pineapple into chunks. I prefer chunky pineapple in my sauce. Of course I couldn't whisk the mixture but stirring worked fine too. I had planned to take a photo to post but my family devoured it before I could. Also I didn't dice the green pepper. I cut it (and the celery) into julienne strips. The times are pretty much right on target. You can make this dinner in under 30 minutes and your family will think you worked really hard!!",

I was so pleasantly surprised that I was able to pull it off! My mother sister and stepdad all said it was just as good as from a Chinese restaurant. The only difference between the two is that at the place we get take-out from they fry the chicken (like a tempura batter). However this is a healthier alternative to the fried chicken and just as delicious. I chose to make this with red peppers rather than green peppers and I also used a sweet onion rather than a regular onion. I served it over white rice for which I just purchased the cheap frozen kind. My mom asked me to make this again one night for dinner!",
