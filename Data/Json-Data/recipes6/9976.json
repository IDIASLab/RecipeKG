Sauteed the onion and green pepper, then added all the other ingredients except the cheese, and I didn't bother coating the chicken - just dumped in the spices.

I had about double the chicken and it made 8 servings. Like others I used cream cheese, too.\nIt was a total hit and most of us had seconds, and I was asked to make it again.",

My opinion is to start with a recipe like this and not change it until you\u2019ve tried it first, to get the original. Then maybe tweak to a personal taste. I see others adding beans, garlic, cream cheese not Neufch\u00e2tel, etc. I think the garlic might change it too much, but corn or beans might work. I wasn\u2019t sure which green peppers to get as they\u2019re labeled hot or nothing. I went with the not hot and it was plenty spicy enough. Our  crock pot isn\u2019t quite large enough (4quart?) for it- had to ladle out a little by time cheese got added, so I think slow cooking on stove would work.",
