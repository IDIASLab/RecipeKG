We've used the Italian dressing as the marinade but if you're not a fan you can replace the dressing with any marinade of your choice. We've also used soy/worchester with 1 tsp. ground ginger which is equally as good.",

Also I \"nuked\" the bacon half done to make sure the bacon was done and the venison NOT overcooked. This recipe is a keeper and will be devoured again!",
