Unlike those large, more expensive cuts of meat, this is super easy to achieve perfect doneness, which means less anxiety and stress. Serve with crispy pan-fried potatoes.",

The garnish was surprisingly good, though my wife still prefers her lamb the old fashioned way, flavored with garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper only.  I could not find the lamb steaks in any local stores, so had to use boneless leg of lamb and cut and pound it down.  (This ended up being the most difficult part, so get the steaks if you can.  The leg never did pound down as nicely and thinly as Chef John's, so I had to increase cooking times accordingly.)  It was still a nice meal and we enjoyed it for Easter.",
