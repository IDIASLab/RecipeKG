So I replaced it with 1/2 tsp vanilla extract; I also added a splash or two of fresh lemon juice, per reviewer Spongebob7's suggestion.  Used slivered almonds in the topping and that was a good combo with the cherry pie filling.  Broiled topping for about 2 minutes at the end to get it a little more golden and bubbly and try to crisp it up a bit more.  Brought it to our neighborhood potluck and people who said they do not like rhubarb commented on really liking it as they gobbled it up!  So thanks, Kel!",

I tend to cook with what is in my house rather then go get what I may be able to substitute. I used a bag of frozen dark red cherries and also was using frozen rhubarb. Since using frozen I omitted the water. I increased the cornstarch to compensate for the fact I was loosing the thickness of the pie filling. In the crust I increased the fine walnuts to 3/4 cup and also the butter to 1/2 + 2 Tablespoons. I am not sure if it was because of these changes but I did not have a problem with either the filling being to sweet or not having enough crust or the crust not being crisp enough. My family adored this and has said they wish me to make it again and the same way. Not to use the pie filling even if I were to have it. So just another possibility to a great base recipe.  happy cooking",
