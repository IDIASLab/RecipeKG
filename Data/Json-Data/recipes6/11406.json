As for my adjustments, I'd suggest mixing the graham cracker crumbs with the sugar and sprinkling them into the cupcake cups. Then just put a pat of butter on top (before you add the cream cheese). The crust comes together perfectly on its own while they're in the oven. We loved it, and I will definitely make this again!",

Lots of people mentioned that they liked that they weren't too sweet but I don't imagine that adding a bit extra sugar would hurt it at all! It was also perfect for my kids too.
