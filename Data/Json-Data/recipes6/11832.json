I made the following substitutions with great success: 3/4 c. spleda for the 1 c. of white sugar EggBeaters for the eggs low fat sour cream reduced from 16 tablespoons of butter to 14 and used half real butter & half light butter. Even then when you cut them into 24 squares (which I think is a better serving size than 30 squares) they are still pretty high calorie. Next time I'll probably cut the crust/crumble mix down by a 1/4 and use less crumble on top. I did say next time because these are so tasty I will have to make them again.",

I also added an extra sprinkle or 2 of cinnamon to both the filling and the crust. Will definitely make again! Bon Appetit!",
