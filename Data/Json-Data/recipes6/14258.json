If you have a tough time finding canned TART cherries (or worse yet fresh which only seem to be in season on or about June 17 each year for about an hour and 13 minutes - what? You missed it?!) this is perfect! Cherry pie is my husband's favorite and so I'm stocking the freezer with cranberries while they're in season. For a more authentic cherry pie taste I skipped the vanilla and used 1/2 tsp almond extract plus 1 Tb fresh lemon juice. This gives it a great tart kick which is what DH loves about cherry pie. I also used 2/3 Splenda and 1/3 white sugar in place of all sugar which is now standard practice for me when making any pie. No one is any the wiser but it allows the diabetics in the bunch to partake without guilt plus everyone is happier to have skipped the carbs. Thank you for posting this recipe which will no doubt be requested on every major holiday in this house until I reach the end of my pie-baking days.",

I made it for a crowd and it was very well-received even by those only marginally interested in cranberries including those who turn their noses up at raisins. The tartness of the cranberries mellows out with the first cooking of the berries and makes for a pleasant fruity pie. It makes a great autumn pie perfectly appropriate for Thanksgiving dinner but I plan on making it year-round!",

Hubby said it could be tarter for his taste so next time I'm upping the cranberries by 1/4 c to1/2 c and cutting the raisins by the same ratio. Oh when I made the filling per directions I found it a bit too runny so made a slurry with 1 Tbs. cornstarch and 1/2 tbs. water stirred it into the filling and cooked to boiling to thicken...came out perfect after pie was cooked. Tip: I used the Buttery Flakey pie crust recipe from this website...that crust is DA BOMB! I'm adding this pie to my holiday dessert list!",
