I also threw in a small handful of sharp cheddar cheese after mixing it together.  Oh, I completely forgot to add the butter...it doesn't even need it!  It's so rich from the cream cheese you won't miss it!\nYou could add additional toppings like bacon and sour cream if you want to go the extra mile, but again, it doesn't even need it!  Tasty!",

I did modify them slightly by adding two cups of shredded cheddar (I made four potatoes though) and I used the entire thing of cream cheese (8oz) instead of the 6oz that it would be for doubling the recipe.  I also know I used more than two Tbsp of milk, probably more like four.  I then topped the potatoes with some shredded cheddar and baked.  They were so amazing!  We have tried so many twice baked potato recipes and this one is the winner!!!",

I had already used all my cream cheese to make cheesecake so I had to add more milk to make it creamy about 1/2 cup total. Also for some extreme flavor I added 1 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic 1 tbsp of parsley. I baked 4 potatoes so I can have really full potato skins but I was still able to have enough remaining over to use as a side for next day dinner menu. Added some shredded sharp cheddar cheese sour cream and scallions to the top with some steak gravy. Delicious!!",
