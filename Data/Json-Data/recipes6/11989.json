But sadly, although these were pretty good, they were not like the ones at the cafe'. I give it 4 stars because they were fudgy and had a good flavor and everyone liked them, but they just weren't the ones I was hoping for. A note about working with the sticky dough - I'm glad I read other reviews. I put mine in the freezer for about 45 minutes and used spoons to scoop out the dough DIRECTLY into the powdered sugar. Once the dough was in the sugar, they were easy to handle and just plopped into a perfect circle onto the pan. And you MUST used GREASED pans or they WILL stick terribly because of the powdered sugar on the bottom of the cookie.",

To intensify the chocolate \"experience,\" I added 1/2 cup melted bittersweet chocolate and used dutch-processed cocoa powder.  For those who are having trouble with the top cracking, here's a tip:  Place your cookie sheet on the second to-the-top rack and only bake one cookie sheet at a time.  The hot heat at the top of the oven enables the cookie to crack.  This trick also works for ginger snaps.",

Make sure to coat them with enough powdered sugar to get them to \"crinkle.\"\n\nHere are some suggestions: Divide the dough into two and spread it out in a plate. Put it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes. Before forming them into balls, get your hands wet so they won't stick to them. You might have to pop them back in the freezer if it's a hot day just DON'T try to handle them when they're warm because you will just be wasting your time. Also, get creative with them! I've made them with cinnamon one time and I coated them with powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon and those turned out GREAT :)",
