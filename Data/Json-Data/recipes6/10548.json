Now I can have it...when I'm ready to do some work! One thing that I encountered when making the dough was that it was quite sticky when kneading. I didn't want to add too much flour when kneading. Did anyone else have that same problem? Also when making it I put too much filling and I made the dough too thin so when I steamed it the meat was showing through. It suppose to be all bun til you bite inside to get a wonderful mouthful of filling with the yummy bun. Otherwise this was great and I'm excited I can make it now! follow up: I wanted to add they're great to make a bunch at a time freeze it in bags. When reheating wrap in a damp cloth or papertowel and microwave for about a minute (usually less).",

Rather than 24 buns I made 11 each the size of a small fist. This allows more meat filling which is usually my favorite part. On step 4 I squeezed the meat mixture into a small compact ball to make enclosing it with dough easier. Also I used a spoon sprayed with PAM to push out/extend the edges of my circle so the bottom was thicker. This also made the enclosure easier. I don't have a steam wok so I used a pressure cooker. I boiled an inch or two of water had to coffee mugs inside and had the holed plate on top. Then I put the buns on top for steaming- worked great! Changes of recipe: I substituted sherry for rice wine and didn't include the shrimp.",
