The only thing I did different was to put it in different order because I didn't want the flower mix or sugar to seep down and I wanted the raisins to be at the top incase they didn't want raisins in their cookies. The layer order I used was: flour mixture (bottom) brown sugar white sugar rolled oats then the raisins. All in all a FANTASTIC recipe!! My 1 1/2 year old son LOVED them (he cried when there was no more!!) so we give this one a 2 thumbs up!!",

Thanks Lisa for another great looking and great tasting Cookie in a Jar Recipe! Tip: Don't buy the baking raisins that are \"moisture rich\" for the jar. They are great in the cookies but look much to moist to be sealed in the jar.",
