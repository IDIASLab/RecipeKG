Also Since I had shrimp shells I cooked them to make a shrimp broth I substituted 1/4 cup chicken stock for shrimp. For those of you that felt it was bland I would guess you used can chicken stock. I had made my chicken stock the day before and it (as well as the dish) had great flavor. Even though I stopped after I put in the bacon and second batch of stock took the pot to my sister's (10min away) then added the shrimp and heated through till they were cooked it still came out great. Thanks for a keeper oh and the bacon does make it but so does homeade chicken/shrimp stock:-)",

The sauce is so amazing. Perfect with rice and some french bread to sop up the rest. I prefer to always cook my rice in the rice cooker. For the shrimp/sauce mixture only use 1.5 cups of broth if not adding rice. You can then thicken the sauce if needed with corn startch. Also I'm so glad I had my hubs run to the store for bacon. I don't really like nutmeg but 1/4tsp. taste just fine in this. Delicious!",
