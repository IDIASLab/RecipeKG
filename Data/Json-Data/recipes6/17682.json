That being said there is one flaw in this recipe; corn starch should be used for thickening in the topping instead of flour probably about 2 TBSP would work. There is a flour taste to the topping and it doesn't have the smooth pleasing texture it should have. I followed the recipe except used a whole cup of whipped cream in the topping. I will definitely make this again using corn starch as the thickening agent.",

I don't understand the ones that bought another can of pineapple juice or used orange juice--there is plenty of juice from the draining of the can of pineapple.
