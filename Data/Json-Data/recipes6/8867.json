I pounded the breasts to an even thickness, about 1\u201d and placed it about 4\u201d-5\u201d inches from the broiler. Even so, the cook time stated wasn\u2019t long enough. It took 10 minutes total.   This is a good way to cook up a bunch of chicken for meal prep. If you are going to be adding it to another recipe, leaving it plain is fine, but for meal preppers such as myself, I\u2019d appreciate some sort of seasoning. Most people don't eat their chicken plain.",
