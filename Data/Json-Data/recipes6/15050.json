I was a bit worried about sugar being in the recipe but it adds just a hint of sweetness and they're still great with savory flavors like gravy. They have a rich buttery taste and a light texture. I've used the dough as a topping for casseroles and pot pies and it works great. It puffs up in the oven more than you'd expect. You can also roll them up with bacon and cheese or tiny sausages before baking them and have a great snack. The time spent on these is worth it! (And it always seems to take my dough a little longer to rise than the recipe states.) Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",
