I made some minor adjustments after reading previous reviews: My medium sized nectarines were a little tart & not ripe enough so I made a chunky puree in my food processor then adjusted the milk to 2 or 3 tablespoons instead of 1/3 cup--I would recommend not adding the milk until you see how liquid the batter is after adding your fruit. Additional ingredients: another 1/4 cup brown sugar for a sweeter muffin which I prefer 1 t cinnamon 1/4 t nutmeg 1 T vanilla. Also mix just until ingredients are moistened don't overmix. I made 12 muffins added a streusel topping of brown sugar flour butter & a sprinkle of cinnamon the first time then just the sprinkle of brown sugar the 2nd time--it really only needs the brown sugar sprinkle. These would also be good with fresh summer peaches but liquid content would need adjustment. Thanks Elizabeth these are excellent!",

I baked them in mini muffin cups for 13 minutes in the highest oven rack.  It made 34 minis.  Very moist and very peachy.  I only had peaches so I used 3 medium peaches.",

I used all (very ripe) nectarines (no peaches) and added a touch each of nutmeg cinnamon and vanilla which really brought out the fruit flavor. The brown sugar topping has a wonderful crunch when the muffins are just out of the oven. They taste just as good after being frozen as they are fresh. I suggest doubling the recipe (which I did) because you will definitely want more of these treats. This is a perfect way to use those extra ripe peaches and nectarines!",
