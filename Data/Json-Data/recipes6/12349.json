They're good as is but I used cream instead of milk this time and switched out half the shortening with butter. They are so good this way! They don't expand very much at all so you can put quite a few on the cookie sheet. To save yourself time put about 1/4 of the dough at a time in a ziploc bag and nip the corner twist the bag opening to make it into a pastry bag then squeeze out to the desired length directly on to the sesame seeds using a butter knife to cut it. Then just flip the cookie over as you place it on your parchment paper and pop them in the oven. It saves a ton of time and your hands don't get all gooey!",
