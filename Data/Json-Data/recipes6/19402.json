I prepared this as written save for doubling up on the vanilla and omitting the almond which just didn't appeal to me. I used a very good quality cocoa  so it was deeply chocolate.  It had great chocolate flavor but something was missing; a smoothness, a richness, a silkiness. This was just, well, flat tasting.  And then it occurred to me - the recipe did not call for a little butter to be stirred in at the end with the vanilla as it typically is with cooked custards like this.  And it was deeply missed.",
