There are a lot of different variations to this recipe that are equally as good so don't be afraid to experiment and adjust to your taste. This variation was good but I usually will omit the Beau Monde and reduce the celery salt to 1 tsp and Dill to 2 tbsp. I like a little tang so usually add 2-3 oz of soft cream cheese. NOTE ON DRIED BEEF: If your unfamiliar with this ingredient or any ingredient for that matter taste it! Understand the flavor and texture before adding it in. Anyone who's tasted dried beef straight out of the package or jar knows immediately it's cured in salt and should be rinsed...and they probably won't do it a second time. Rinse the dried beef off slice by slice then taste it again. If it's still too salty rince and repeat. I tried another reviewer's suggestion and added about 1 tbsp of very finely diced onion another keeper! I bet stirring in a little roasted garlic paste would be good too....next time I roast garlic I'm gonna try it.:)",
