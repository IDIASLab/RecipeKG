Can't quite put my finger on it, but something was off, maybe the combination of the three flavors, or maybe Grand Marnier was not the best choice of liqueur. This was just okay, and there are many better mousse, raspberry, and white chocolate recipes than this. None of my dinner guests were particularly impressed either, but for those who are going to give this recipe a shot my suggestion would be to try Cassis, or Chambord, or leave the liqueur out altogether.",

It was very easy to make and had a nice light taste. It was a great finisher for a heavy dinner. I bought Keebler waffle cone cups and painted them with melted chocolate and then piped in the mousse. I drizzled extra raspberry sauce on top and then added fresh raspberries. I also drew designs in the plates with raspberry sauce and then put the cups on them. I used a squeeze ketchup bottle from the grocery store for the sauce. This made a great elegant dessert that actually wasn't all that hard to make. I will definitely make this again!

I really liked Amber's presentation idea of serving it in fancied up waffle cones (thumbs up to Amber!) but was transporting these to my daughter's so I made chocolate cups for the grown-ups instead.
