Be sure to use flour when rolling it otherwise it will be sticky. I baked them on parchment paper which worked wonderfully since the filling does come out. They lifted right off. I made some with chocolate (I used a dark chocolate spread but Nutella work well too) with crushed nuts. Be sure to roll out the dough fairly thin. I found that to be key. Once the filling has been spread I suggest rolling the entire thing and then cutting it using a pizza cutter. They come out log shaped that way but they still look nice and it is less time consumming. Thanks for the great recipe.",

My only advice is to heavily grease your cookie sheets. The non-stick cookie sheets are really not effective. The preserves bubble over and stick to the tray. Other than that these were easy and tasted fabulous!",
