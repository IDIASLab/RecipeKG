I had some very thick chops and decided to go for it with this recipe.  I'm glad I did because they were wonderful!  I only had italian style bread crumbs but they added a very nice flavor to the stuffing. I added about 1/2 a cup more of the broth to the pan which was just enough to drizzle over the chops.  I would even suggest thickening it a bit to make it more of a gravy if desired. The family loved them and were very impressed!  This would be great to serve to company too.  If you've never tried making stuffed chops, give this recipe a try.",

I use only 2 thick cut (an inch at least) chops, half of a boxed pork stuffing mix, and an entire can of low sodium beef stock (about 2 cups).  I put a little salt, pepper and garlic powder on them inside and out before stuffing.  Also, when I have time I brine the chops for a couple hours before stuffing (a little salt and sugar dissolved in a large bowl of water and let the chops soak).  15 minutes on each side simmering with the pan uncovered has worked perfectly for me.  The stock reduces down quite a lot and any bits of stuffing that sneak out really do help to make it a gravy as other reviewers stated.  I serve them with roasted rosemary potatoes.  As the chops are so huge I can usually only finish half of one and they are just as good the next day. ",

The stuffing wouldn't stay inside the pork chop and it ended up being VERY messy.  In the future I will make sure my pork chops are cut thicker.  I ended up making the stuffing into a gravy as it was overflowing anyways.  It still had a great taste and I look forward to trying this again.  The only changes I made were... Adding extra garlic power, adding extra butter to the stuffing and using chicken broth instead of beef broth. I will not be adding this to my regular rotation.",

The dish was a touch salty and I even used low sodium beef broth and only added 1/4 t. salt to the stuffing. Also I didn't buy thick cut pork chops---but I should have. I had a difficult time creating the pocket in the regular cut chops--I just used more toothpicks. I added the remainder of the stuffing to the pan juices to thicken but again the onion would have been better if it had first been softened. I think with a few minor adjustments next time I will definitely give 5 stars.",
