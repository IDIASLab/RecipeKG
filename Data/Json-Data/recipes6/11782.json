After 3 failures I think I finally figured it out (my husband decided to be nice and buy me all the ingredients I'd need for all my Christmas fudge so I had to keep trying it). While boiling I put all other ingredients into one bowl (with marshmallow creme on top to avoid it just sticking to the bowl) and at the end of five minutes I dumped in the last ingredients quickly and THEN took it off the stove. If the fudge gets too hot (stirring while still on the stove) or isn't hot enough (taking it off stove then adding last ingredients) it won't set up right. Today it turned out perfectly and set up wonderfully. It does have a good taste to it whether it sets up or not but let's face it nobody reading this recipe was looking for fudge sauce!",

I do it the original way that is with a bag of chocolate chips. I liked this cuz it was so easy. I don't have a candy thermonotor and was glad I didn't have to use one here. Just make sure you keep stirring and don't let it burn. I think everyone's problem is the recipe change (not using chocolate chips). Maybe we should write Kraft and complain and they would put the old recipe back. Good idea I'm going to write them right now.:) The stars are for the old recipe. I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE KRAFT SITE AND if anyone would like they have the old recipe look up Fantasy Fudge on the same page they list the old recipe calling it Classic Fantasy Fudge. Good Luck",
