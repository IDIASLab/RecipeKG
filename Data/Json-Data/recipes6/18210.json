Traditional pashka is a molded cheese and uses farmer's cheese and boiled egg yolks. I like to use blueberries in place of currants (traditionally raisins) and I highly recommend opting for ricotta cheese over sour cream. Throw in some freshly-grated lemon rind and a dash of rosewater and chill in miniature bundt molds overnight. Garnish the finished cheese mold with a sprig of mint and a lemon curl and serve with a dense and crusty sweetbread. Your brunch guests will sing your praises.",

This recipe sounds like the pashka 'cheese' used as a spread for the sweet and thick crusted bread. I have heard the cheese is best made with 'real' cottage cheese (from local farmers) rather than that found in a local grocery store. The texture is much finer and it provides a richer taste.",
