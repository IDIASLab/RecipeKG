I added two tsp of cinnamon and I put the egg in the measuring cup then added 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half cream and the dough consistency was perfect.  I added raisins and almonds to mine.  When I took the dough from the bowl, it was crumbly, but I was able to easly mold it into a dough ball and flatten it and cut it into about 12 good size scones.  I also added a bit of lemon zest.... If people had dough that was too wet, they really need to try putting the egg in the measuring cup first, then adding the milk.  If you want quick easy scones, this recipe is for you!!! I will make again.",

This was the first time I ever made scones, but not my boyfriend- he gave me a really good tip: see, I was confused and thought that I was supposed to add the entire egg/ milk mixture to the dough, but instead, he said to just add enough of it so that the dough be moistened (We only used about half of the egg/ milk mixture).  Oh yeah, and you have to add it only a little bit at a time, and work the dough each time after you add it.  That way, you can tell how moistened it is.  I know this is what the recipe says to do, but what i THOUGHT the directions said was to add the whole mixture and keep mixing until it was moistened.  It was good the way my boyfriend taught me to do it.  We added enough cinamin so that the dough was a very very light brown. We added to the dough BEFORE we put the egg/ milk in.",

I also recommend using the food processor to combine the flour mixture and butter.  I put 1/2 of the flour mixture into the processor at a time and just used a light pulse to incorporate the butter into the flour.  I then put the butter and flour mixture into a large bowl and stirred in the egg mixture.  One thing that I don't recommend is using the drop method for these scones.  The texture was much better when I added a little more flour to roll out, then kneaded a couple times and patted down into a circle and made scone wedges.  Happy baking!!",

I have looked for a while for a recipe and this one sounded the closest to how I remember my mother making them.  I have to say, they were delicious.  The taste and texture were exactly how I remembered.  Traditionally in UK, scones are round like American biscuits, so I used a biscuit cutter to make them and ended up with double the yield as a result.  I also added raisins, which is a common variation in UK.  They can be enjoyed as they are or cut in half with jam and/or butter, but the best way to eat them is with jam and cream!  If they are made correctly, they are certain to stick to the roof of your mouth as you eat them so it's always a good idea to have a drink with them - preferably, steaming cup of English tea!\nAll in all, an excellent recipe.  Very simple to follow and with delicious results.",

Unfortunately no one else (including the dog) agreed with me. Everyone took one bite and that was it. And like many other reviewers, I too, had to add a lot more flour than the recipe calls for. I was disappointed with this recipe.",
