                "reviewBody": "This is actually a recipe for hassenpheffer and should NOT be confused as being a 'traditional type' of savory 'stew'. It is traditionally a tangy (kind of soury) tase so you should be aware of this when making it otherwise you will be giving it an unfair review. It is also a recipe that requires an aquired tase and/or affinity for a dish such as this. That being said the first time I had a dish like this I didn't care for it at all. Then I went to Germany in the military and had it made the authentic german way. I really enjoyed it (and found the person who made the first dish I tried had done so incorrectly) and then began ordering it every chance I got while over there. I made it once for myself back here in the states and again it was pretty bad. My problem I found was that since I didn't have the red wine vinegar I thought it would be 'okay' to just use regular white vinegar. Well it wasn't 'okay'. You REALLY DO need to use the red wine vinegar & this recipe should turn out perfectly for you as I had found. Another suggestion is that if you do not want or care for as strong of a tangy/sourish taste in your own dish then cut back on the time you allow the rabbit to marinade to a day or even as much as 12 hours. It will not be authentic that way however you may find it more to the liking of 'american taste buds' if it has a little less zing to it. I hope this review has helped to clear up some misconceptions regarding a recipe such as this.;-)",
