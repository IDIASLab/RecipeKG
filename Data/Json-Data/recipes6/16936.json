I bake a lot and this will definitely be made again. My husband and I almost just polished off 1/2 the cake. On the baking process I will not use the blender next time. I will use my stand mixer and follow the same process. The blender did not mix it well and it was almost spilling out. I followed the recipe exactly except for using pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice since I don't have that. I would have to alter the recipe if I wanted to serve it to others (other than me and my family) because I didn't like how it didn't fill the pan enough so it wasn't a nice tall bundt cake. It stands low. i used a silicone bundt pan and it took about 40-45 minutes to bake through. Great tasting I love the syrup in it but would use my stand mixer next time. Thanks for a good tasting bundt cake recipe!!!",
