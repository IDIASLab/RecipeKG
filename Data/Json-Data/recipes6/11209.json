This particular recipe yielded a moist sweet orange-colored cake that was almost like banana bread. This cake was especially good the next morning for breakfast sliced like bread and slathered with a bit of butter. Few people even in Hawaii are likely to find fresh guavas however. Try guava paste from specialty food stores. Enjoy! Aloha!",

I would suggest being very careful when getting the guava pulp--the seeds would make an uncomfortable finding in your cake! Overall this was more like a spice cake; very moist but I don't know if many people could have figured out it was guava without my saying so. That said everyone liked it and I was asked for the recipe by three people. Just as a note I used freshly grated nutmeg and put some guava nectar in the frosting. I will definitely make this cake again.",
