The results of that batch were okay--others liked them--but to me they were heavy and dull. When I returned home and could actually use the hartshorn I'd bought for this recipe: oh wow!!! This recipe--plus the hartshorn--is a holy grail for me. The texture is substantial but has a light clean dry crunch that I now know is characteristic of hartshorn. Do go to the trouble of finding some for these cookies; it's definitely worth it!",

Very similar in taste but I think the crunch and texture is better in these. The entire family agrees. Please consider less almond extract or replacing with vanilla. The flavor is very strong and may be too much for some people. I used 1-tsp instead of of 1-1/2 tsp. It really is plenty. Definitely a keeper. We sprinkled colored sugar on ours like we usually do with the spritz. Find the ammonia for this. It makes it!",

Perfect for ladies brunch or tea. I used only 1t of almond extract and 1/2 t of vanilla and did not feel I was missing any almond flavor. Would do same again next time. Delightfully light crisp almond coconut grown up cookie. Does smell like ammonia in batter when cooking and when just out of oven but then smell goes away and is never super strong. If you put your nose over cookie dough you will smell it. Keep an eye on them they are much darker on bottom then top of cookie. Air bake pans worked better on this recipe for me.",
