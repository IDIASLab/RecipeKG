Husband got them back out to eat and asked me to make another batch for the freezer! I had never made a cookie that used oil rather than butter or shortening. This is a fast cookie to make as you just stir everything no mixer. I think the trick is to take out of oven at about 9 minutes (they WILL look NOT done) and let them rest on the cookie sheet for the full 5 minutes like the recipe states. VERY GOOD cookie and will soon be making a third batch! Thanks Fran for sharing the recipe.",

I used butter instead of vegetable oil (I'm low on oil right now) increased the butter to a full cup (no wonder they turned out dry--not enough fat) and I used a full teaspoon of vanilla. I ran my oats through the blender for a finer consistancy before adding it to the cookie dough AND I crushed my cornflakes. I had M&M's to use so I used those in place of chocolate chips. 1/3 of a cup wasn't near enough so I used a cup each of both milk chocolate and peanut butter M&M's. These were a tasty cookie with the changes I made thanks to the other reviewers that went before me. This was a great way to use up bags and containers of odds and ends I had AND make a sweet treat.",

I crush the corn flakes well and use a little less than called for used mini choc chips and also add 1 cup of coconut and 1 cup pecans. You definitely don't want to over bake them; they do not really get brown on top. I bake them at 350 (reduces to 325 on convection setting)for about 8 minutes.",
