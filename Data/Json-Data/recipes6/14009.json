I followed it to a T, and the pie was looking pretty, smelling pretty, even golden just beautifully. I sliced it up for my whole family and as I was taking photos of the piece I had, I hear several yucks and that's nasty coming from my family. I tasted it and WOW, the flavor really was really out there and it's something I have never tasted before nor want to again.....Sorry I don't know how or why but it totally was not very tasteful or pleasing to our taste buds. It just didn't taste right at all. The bananas in pineapple juice with sugar and cinnamon tasted great \"BUT\" that was before I baked it. Soo Soo sorry, it won't be made again in my kitchen.",
