This is reminiscent of the fruiti di bosco jam we fell in love with while stationed in Italy. Update: Running low on Rhubarb I added some frozen cranberries to make up for the tartness - wonderful!",

(I used 1/2 cup less sugar than called for + add 1 cup strawberries) I only had 1/2 a jar that I was able to keep for myself.  I basically ate it all out of the jar that 1st night.   The following week I decided to make another batch, this time with cherry pie filling & forgot to reduce the sugar to 2-1/2 cups.  I really liked this too, but not as much as the blueberry.   To sum up:   --Blueberry better than Cherry (but, can't go wrong with either!!!) --3 cups sugar IS a bit too sweet, 2-1/2 cups is PERFECT! --add strawberries for that extra umpf of YUMMINESS! --fast & very easy to make/use up rhubarb (P.S.: Teachers begged that I make it again next year for teachers' gifts.)",
