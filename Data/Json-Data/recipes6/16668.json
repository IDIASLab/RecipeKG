Her original recipe came from a 1980 Parenting magazine and instead of rolling the hot cookies in the crushed candy cane, we've always mixed a little bit of water with confectioner's sugar and brushed it on the tops of the cooled cookies and then rolled them in the crushed candy cane.

I really liked the crushed candy cane bits on top... though, I had a little trouble getting it to stick... even hot out of the oven... but if you put it on before they go in the oven, the will melt.  If you are looking for a quicker method of making these cookies... I got tired of rolling out all the pieces towards the end of my baking, so I made one big log out of the two colors and put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes... then I cut off slices of the dough and baked them... they looked beautiful, and tasted just as good!!",

I also use gel food coloring so the red dough isn't so moist that you can't work with it. I also divide the dough and color half BEFORE I chill it in the fridge. Much easier. I also find it easier not to roll the hot cookies but instead sprinkle the candy on the top with a spoon when they are hot. The candy sticks really well if you do it that way and the cookies don't break. YUM.",
