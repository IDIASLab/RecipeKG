But, I had a pint of strawberries in the 'fridge and some pie plant in the freezer, so when I found this recipe (sans jell) I made it.  Here are the mistakes I made so you can avoid them:  #1 - don't let your frozen rhubarb thaw, it throws off the amount.  I probably ended up using more like 8 cups instead of 4.  Fresh rhubarb would be the best, but frozen will work as long as you measure it frozen when it's more the size of fresh.  #2 - Don't use the strawberries you buy in March or early April.  They are more sour and don't have a very good flavor.  Or else adjust the amount of sugar you use to compensate for their sourness.  I am definitely going to make this pie again in another month with good, locally grown strawberries and my own fresh cut pie plant.  Thanks for the recipe Wilma!",

                "reviewBody": "As another reviewer said, it makes a LOT of filling, so I had two shells ready. This should be called a custard pie since there's no cream or milk involved. The eggs make a thick filling which sets up nicely. Also, be sure to keep the strawberry pieces relatively large; halve the smaller strawberries, cut the big ones into thirds. Cook at 400 for about 30 minutes and then reduce to 350 and cook another 15-20 minutes. Turn off oven and let the pie sit for 10-15 minutes. Let cool thoroughly before slicing. It'll cut cleanly. As another cook mentioned, don't put too much egg white or it'll brown too much. Comes out pretty! I reduced the nutmeg by half and added a dash of cinnamon. My husband scarfed it down. ",

The texture is wonderful with the rhubarb and stawberries giving a sweet and sour taste with every bite. I used a store bought crust and then covered it half way through with aluminum foil to protect the crust from burning. I also used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda. Next time I will try with 100% Splenda. The pie came out perfect. Very easy and quick recipe to make. Perfect with French Vanilla ice cream!",
