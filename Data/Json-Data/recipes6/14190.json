I may try adding 2/3 cup of raisins to the next batch for a change of pace. I really enjoy pumpkin and these are great... not to mention healthy! If you do not have the flour called for do not waste your time and money. It would make up differently! This is chemistry folks!",

This recipe is truly for those of us who are diabetic, and/or are watching carb intake; because of the lack of added fat and the addition of the applesauce, the texture may take some getting used to. But for those of us who need this recipe to work, it certainly does. Per the reviews, I cut the applesauce in HALF, and doubled the spices. This took care of the \"too moist\" problem.  I also added a tablespoon of ground flax seed for additional fiber. They were delicious. As stated, if you DON'T need to watch your fat, carbs, and calories please choose another pumpkin muffin recipe with full fat. For those of us who need this recipe, I, for one, was not disappointed.",

I did sprinkle a little brown sugar over each muffin before baking. My muffins were done at 22 minutes. These turned out quite big--very fluffy and moist. Very pretty muffin. My one issue was that it had a little too much nutmeg. I'd like to make this again but I think I would use pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.",
