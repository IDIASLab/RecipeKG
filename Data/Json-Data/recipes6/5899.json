Threw in couple of handfuls noodles for about 5min. Added several handfuls fresh spinach.  Placed chicken pieces back in soup. Melted 1/4 butter, whisked in 1/4 c flour for couple minutes.  Slowly whisked in 1c evaporated milk 1 c heavy whipping cream. Added to soup for another minute.  Sprinkle pink salt and pepper to taste.  We loved this!  Outstanding flavor!",
