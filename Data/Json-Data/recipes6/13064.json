I did make a few changes.  I used extra light olive oil instead of butter.  Reduced the sugar by 1/2cup and used 1/2 brown/white.  I replaced the almonds with walnuts and added coconut.  I did not ice it at all.  Super yummy.  I do think I will reduce the amount of sugar by another 1/2 cup next time.  The dates make it plenty sweet.  If I was to ice it for taking it to an event, I would definately reduce the sugar.  Oh yes, I mashed the bananas.  I used 3 very ripe ones.",

I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup, didn't add any almonds because I didn't have any on hand, and used dried dates as opposed to the softer, moist ones packaged in plastic (although I'll definitely try to use those next time I make this). The end result was a moist delicious cake-like dessert that is just awesome with the lemon glaze on top. I made this on a whim and out of boredom, but I'll definitely be making this again and again in the future.",

I made a few changes... the thought of big smushy banana chunks in my cake made me shiver - so I substituted the 2 c. sliced bananas for 1 c. mashed bananas - ahhhhh much better... mild banana flavour no chunks still a very moist cake! Also I used half whole wheat and half white flour to give it even more of a \"health kick\". Thanks for an interesting recipe Sandra!",

They can out so moist and the banana flavor is exceptional!!! Do try this recipe. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!",

I think that the full amount of sugar sweet dates frosting = sugar overload. I mashed 2 bananas and sliced 2 more which I folded in at the end with the dates and almonds. If you think you might not frost these make sure to tuck the banana slices down into the batter as they become discolored on the surface. I think this recipe is enhanced with the frosting. It is just the right amount to cover the top and add zip but not be that overly thick frosting that has become the rage lately.",
