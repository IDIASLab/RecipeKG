While I was making the sauce I felt like I all I was smelling was the tart lime and sesame oil flavours over everything else which was turning me off slightly but I kept on going with the recipe. I always use half the amount of soy sauce in these types of recipe (because of sodium content) and always replace the other half with water which works out great. I didn't have whole wheat noodles so I used the regular kind and I didn't have zucchini so I sauteed some christophene instead (cause I felt it would replace the zucchini nicely and I dunno if christophene is eaten raw I always stir-fry it) It turned out great like that loved the different texture of crunchiness in the veggies. Back to the issue of the sauce flavour after I tossed it all together I felt like I was still smelling the lime and sesame oil predominately but lo and behold after it sat and got time to marry the flavours the strong smells were gone and it tasted great too! I was pleasantly surprised and I added extra pepper to mine. It was delish. Thanks for sharing.",

Since then I've made a few alterations per mine and my family's preferences. I don't care for raw bell pepper or zucchini so I dropped the matchstick veggies into the pasta water for about 30 seconds just to soften them slightly. I added peanuts to the salad after it was plated. So yummy. I think I'm going to make cucumber matchsticks this time in addition to the other vegs since I like a little crunch and took that out by cooking the other vegs. Maybe some won ton skin cut into strips and quick-fried to sprinkle on top! Obviously you can customize however you wish but it is delicious as written as well. Thank you tyansia! edit: I forgot to mention that I couldn't find the chinese noodles and used whole wheat spaghetti broken into thirds before cooking.",
