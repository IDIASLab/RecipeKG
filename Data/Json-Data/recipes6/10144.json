It's a big recipe because I'm always serving a crowd but it's easily scaled down for smaller portions. The tart apples are a beautiful balance with the deliciously sweet praline topping. I've been working on this recipe for a few years and finally got it perfect! Enjoy! Serve with warm maple syrup.",
