I added a combination of fresh and frozen veggies I had on hand (broccoli, bean sprouts, snap peas, baby carrots), and a little bit of sugar and terriyaki to the soy sauce.  I mixed the soy sauce and terriyaki sauce together in a jar (along with the bit of sugar I added), and then added as much as I thought the dish needed, with a little bit left over for next time.... The flavor was awesome, and it was very filling.  I will definitely make this again!!",

I cooked the rice in butter, not margarine, and made the sesame seed thing easy on myself by using the already toasted variety. I deliberately omitted the ginger root, as I detest it as some folks do cilantro - purely a subjective thing.   I made no changes to the vegetables called for, although so many would be equally as suitable.  I finished it with a dab of butter and a squeeze of  fresh lemon juice.  I enjoyed this immensely.",

                "reviewBody": "Asparagus is expensive at 4.99/lb so I substituted Eating Right's pre-packaged Broccoli Stir Fry (with includes carrots snap peas and broccoli florets). This is my second attempt to cook a stir fry dish. The first recipe I tried was Robin Miller's (from Food Network's quick and easy meals). It was decent nothing spectacular. But wow this dish is richer and more flavorful thanks to awesome combination of sesame oil and sesame seeds (adds a a nice texture and leaves a nutty lingering taste). I made a few modifications gleaned from other recipes I researched: I added about 1.3lb of boneless skinless chicken breasts. I cut into 1 1/2 inch strips placed it in a zip lock bag and tossed with 2 tbsp. of cornstarch (. In a separate bowl I mixed soy sauce garlic power and ground ginger and marinated the chicken overnight (30 minutes would do). I then cooked the chicken with the ginger and garlic. I also added veggies in 1-min intervals -- mixing in-between servings to saturate the veggies with flavor and to ensure that is it perfectly cooked. After adding a generous amount of soy sauce and before mixing in the sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds I also dissolved 1 cup of chicken broth with 2 tbsp of cornstarch and let it simmer for 2 minutes to thicken the sauce. My husband's reaction after his first bite? \"WOW!!!!\" I savored this rare moment. He usually waits for me to ask then gives a generic answer (\"Everything you cook is delicious!\"). This recipe is awesome!",
