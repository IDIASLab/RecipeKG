The other is confusion about ingredients in this case the strawberries. The recipe is vague - sliced strawberries halved whole? Sweetened? Unsweetened? I was so confused by all the choices in the grocery store I just finally grabbed halved strawberries in syrup. I found it made for nice chunks of strawberries that floated prettily to the top (kind of like the Italian wild strawberry liqueur Fragoli). I did find it a little sweet but after it diluted a little from the ice cubes in my glass it was much better. But others may not find it too sweet at all! In hindsight given that it was a little too sweet for me and given that I already had strawberries in my freezer I had bagged and frozen myself I think I would have steered away from the frozen sweetened strawberries and just used what I had. Even so it was still deliciously different and very attractive.",
