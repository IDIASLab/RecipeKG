ADVICE: Need to plan for a few breadsticks breaking during prep - since they are so thin (but that's OK because that gives me an excuse to snack on the broken bits!) Since the sticks are shorter i usually cook for 45 minutes but it depends on how crispy you want the bacon too.",

I only \u201cwasted/tasted\u201d a \u201cbreadstick\u201d to see what they tasted like on their own since I\u2019ve never had before. I wasn\u2019t impressed and it made me nervous I would be wasting bacon!  But these were awesome!! Took reviewer Lisa\u2019s advice; cut the bacon in half - lengthwise. Don\u2019t use thick cut bacon! Baked for 25 min @ 325 and they were perfect!  Awesome!! Used Pam-sprayed foil in the oven, used Pam-sprayed wax paper to cook. I plan to bring to Christmas!! Thank you!!",
