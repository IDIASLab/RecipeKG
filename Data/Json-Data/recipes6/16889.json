Also read some reviews that said this bread was kind of bland so I added a little over a teaspoon of cinnamon. CAME OUT GREAT! Very moist! I was afraid it'd dry out since I had to leave it in the oven longer than expected since the middle was mushy but it came out moist and perfect. Will definitely save this recipe and make it again.",

I didn't do walnuts or choc chips but I added a big handful of fresh blueberries, and it was DELICIOUS, it disappeared quickly.  Also, I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  ****I make this a lot, and I've tried different things like adding a couple tablespoons of flax meal and a tablespoon of honey, and taking out some of the liquid since flax is considered a fat substitute. I really recommend it - it comes out so nicely and adds to the nutrition profile a lot.****",

I baked this in a loaf pan so I had baked it about 75-80 minutes. When I took it out the bottom was stil mushy so I put it in the oven for another 10 minutes or so. By then the bread was just about ready (Although there was still a little bit of mushiness unfortunately... I didn't want the crust of the bread too burnt..). This bread was a little bland tasting. I could definitely taste the difference between this and regular banana bread. I much prefer regular banana bread. The loaf was quite dense and it did not rise enough in my opinion so if I were to make it again in a loaf pan I would add maybe a teaspoon more of baking powder. The recipe was alright but I personally think there are better tasting banana bread recipes out there.",
