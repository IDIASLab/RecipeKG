These were easily the tastiest moistest sugar cookies we've ever tasted and there were only a few simple alterations. 1/2 cup butter/margarine 1 1/2 cup white sugar while omitting brown sugar 1/4 regular milk instead of buttermilk. With plenty of flour on hands we rolled them into balls so they'd be round and baked for only 8-10 mins. It made 38 3\" cookies. These were also great as plain sugar cookies with no chocolate chips Everyone raved about these and we quickly saved the altered version so we knew it would be accurate tryng to avoid a \"MacArthur Park\" scenario.;) For the record my 14-yr old made these with glowing results-- should be named EASY with the changes. Try it!! Your family and guests will be begging for the recipe!",

This was a very good chocolate chip cookie but I'm somewhat confused by the name. I thought it would have a sugar cookie taste with chocolate chips. However it tasted like a regular chocolate chip cookie. Tastes very good but not different from other chocolate chip cookies. Also my batch made a little over four dozen not the three dozen stated in the recipe.",

I would have rated 1 star except I didn't follow the recipe exactly b/c I had no buttermilk so I used regular milk. The suggestion to add vinegar to milk to create buttermilk flavor sounded gross to me. I felt the batter and cookie taste were bland and lacked sweetness expected of a sugar or traditional chocolate chip cookie. I also was bored by the cookie texture. I guess some folks like these; I cannot figure out why. I'm even embarrassed to take these to work and claim that I baked them. I also had trouble removing cookies from my good baking sheets with a thin spatula even after I waited at least 20 minutes for cookies to cool. I wouldn't have minded that hassle if the cookie satisfied me. I won't make these again.",
