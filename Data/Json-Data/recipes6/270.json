I changed the order of cooking though... chopped up the bacon and fried it first, took the bacon out of grease, sat it aside and added the onions and cooked them til golden. Then took the onions out, sat aside and then cooked the chicken breast in remaining grease and there was just enough for the 2 chicken breasts. When chicken was just about done, piled on the onions, then the cheese and topped it with the chopped bacon. Covered for a few minutes, cheese melted with bacon bits mixed in. I also drizzled the top with some spicy honey mustard sauce. WONDERFUL...! We will definitely have this one again! And yes, I agree it might not be the healthly way to eat a chicken breast but you have to treat yourself once-in-awhile!",

Used 1 very large fresh Vidalia onion, you could hardly have too many and I used sharp Cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand. It was pretty easy and out of this world yummy.
