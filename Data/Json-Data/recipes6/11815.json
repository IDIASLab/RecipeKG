With adding this extra rhubarb, it does need to cook for at least 40-45 minutes.  I know some people cautioned to check it earlier than the directions.  I was amazed at how tender the rhubarb was considering that it was raw when it went in the oven.  I did make a few alterations.  I used light sour cream, I cut back the brown sugar by 1/4 of a cup, and for the topping, I used half the sugar, and used Sweet'n Low for the other half.  Five stars!",

Be warned: when you are reading the printed recipe it can be confusing; the list of ingredients read from left to right (that's how you read it to coincide with the steps). The only change I made was I whirled frozen rhubarb in my food processor because I just don't like stringy foods and they turned out wonderful. They were cake-like and golden brown. Absolutely perfect with a cup of coffee or tea on this very damp chilly rainy day. Also your house will smell marvelous while these bake! Enjoy.",

Better the second day -- the rhubarb moisture disperses into the cake as does the flavor. More rhubarb up to 2 1/2 cups is an improvement. I found that it baked 5-10 minutes faster; that might be the explanation for the baker who found it dry. A definite keeper for rhubarb season! I'm going to try freezing it and I'm going to try it with double the topping as suggested above.",
