However, as someone mentioned before, there is enough topping to cover double the amount of fruit the recipe asks for!  What I did when I noticed there was going to be too much, was to go ahead and use 1/2 on my peaches; then I used the rest on some frozen cherries I had in the freezer to make a cherry crisp!  So, for me, it was a happy accident :)  The great thing is that, even if I hadn't had extra fruit on hand, I could have just stored the extra topping in a tupperware for future use in the fridge, since there was nothing in it that would go bad!  Thanks for the recipe, Stephanie!",

As for the crisp topping it is good. I also baked at 400 for 30 minutes and the oatmeal topping came out perfect.",
