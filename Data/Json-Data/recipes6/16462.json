Although I only used regular rotini noodles instead of the colored ones I am willing to try both. It is also a tasty way to get kids to eat their vegetables!! Mine loved it!! Also I brought it to a recent family reunion and I had none to bring back home with me! Thank you Melissa!",

I omitted the onion (didn't want) and brocolli (didn't have) substituted red bell pepper for green and used lowfat \"parmesan peppercorn ranch\" dressing. I've been dieting and made this for a quick lunch yesterday. Give it a try. The pasta really mellows out the peppercorn taste in the dressing. I'll save all my leftover dinner veggies from now on to use in this salad!",

As vegetarians it can be a challenge to find recipes that have a lot of veggies but are still kid friendly. This was a hit! I made a few changes and used the ranch dressing mix that comes in a powder and mixed it with half milk and half sour cream for a creamier texture then mixed in cracked peppercorns. Also I reserved half of the mixture until right before I served it so it wouldn't all soak into the pasta. I also added soy bacon bits and peas right before serving. This would be great for a barbecue or chuch picnic.",
