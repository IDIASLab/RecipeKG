For busy moms this is almost a must. Thanks Shawn for a simple yummy recipe.",

I followed the advice of another review and added some vanilla extract and a little more flour. I also omitted about 1/4 cup of butter. I didn't have enough walnuts or any raisins but I didn't feel they detracted from the overall taste. Cooking them a little longer (10-15 minutes) would make a more cookie like texture but I enjoyed the soft dough-like texture more. I actually enjoyed these so much I began to eat them as a quick breakfast and for dessert.",

I was pretty skeptical of this recipe but since I had some bananas that needed used up I thought I'd make these for my marathon-running husband to snack on after his training runs. However now that I've tried one I just hope he gets home quickly or there won't be any left for him! These are really really good!!! I think this just became my new go-to recipe for using up bananas. My changes: I upped the flour to 3 cups and substituted wheat flour for half of that I changed the sugar ratio to 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (in hopes that the brown sugar would help \"disguise\" the wheat flour since I don't usually like the taste of wheat). Next time I might try using all wheat flour and just 1 cup of brown sugar - no white sugar at all. I also added 1 ts of vanilla and 1 ts of sea salt. I don't like raisins very much so I split the dough and added about 1-1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to half. I ended up adding about 3/4-1 cup of chocolate chips to the raisin half too because I ran out of raisins.",
