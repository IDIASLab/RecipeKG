I noticed that there was no salt in the recipe so I added 3/4 of a teaspoon just to be safe and the loaf came out perfect. I used 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of bread machine yeast, 1 egg and substituted coconut extract for the vanilla extract. I baked it on the regular crust sweet bread setting. It was so sweet and soft - almost more like cake than bread. It also made great toast. Delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "I wanted a Hawaiian-style bread like the pull-apart you find in the store.  I wanted to make the dough in my bread machine.  I took the suggestions of Jennifer 72--cut the recipe in half, added the salt, changed the vanilla extract to coconut extract.  I addedd 2TBSP water to adjust for the 1/2 egg I didn't use. \n\nI had to keep adding flour to the recipe to make a dough that I could handle because this is more of a batter bread.  When the dough was right and the cycle was finished, I patted the dough out flat.  I cut the dough into 18 or 20 small pieces.  I rolled those pieces into small balls and placed them in a greased angel food pan.  I let that rise till doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. I baked it at 350degrees for about 35 minutes--till brown on top. I forgot to add some egg wash on top, could do that next time.  Also, I might cover the bread or turn it down.  The sweetness of the dough caused the brown top to get crispy instead of chewy.\n\nAfter baking, I let it sit in the pan on a cooling rack for five minutes.  Then I turned the bread upside down to remove it.\n\nThe guests at my Hawaiian-themed dinner party loved it, it made a great pull-apart bread.\n\nIf anyone tries it this way, I hope you measure how much extra flour you add.  It might have been as much as 3/4cup+.  I just kept adding flour.  Also, I would omit the substitution for the 1/2 egg, just forget about adding extra water.\n\nReally glad that it came out so well.  Enjoy, and hope my comments help.",
