I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt which I believe is very important to the sweetness of any cookie. I used splenda brown sugar and only used 1/2 cup. I really like oats and to be able to chew on them so I used whole oats but crushed them a bit with my hands before using them so I wouldn't so much like a barnyard animal while eating the cookie! After I incorporated all the ingredients I made the dough into balls then pushed them down with the bottom of a glass. I then sprinkled the dough with coarse sugar. After baking for the full 15 minutes they turned out wonderful!",
