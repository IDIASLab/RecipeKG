I left out the apples as a personal preference.  The flavor was very good!  You could cut back on the soy sauce to 2T if you prefer a less salty flavor.  Next time I make this I will make sure to cream my sauce very well before adding to the cabbage.  Thanks for a great  recipe!",

The rest was a breeze to whisk together (omitted the soy 'cause not a fan -- was still DE-licious!), and this took closer to only 15 minutes to throw together.  Served this purple salad on appetizer plates and drizzled the dark brown sauce atop.  Looked beautiful; tasted even better!",
