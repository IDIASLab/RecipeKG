Cut back on the ingredients for the mousse and increase the cooking time and this recipe might be a five star.",

I made a home-made graham cracker crust out of my Betty Crocker cookbook that was heavenly with it. The only problem I had was it took 20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said. When you make this and I recommend that you do make sure to test your cheesecake in the center with a toothpick for doneness. The topping for this cheesecake was way easy and tasted wonderful. I added a bit of red food coloring to it to give it more color since I used cherry preserves. Delicious cheesecake! I will make this again and again.",
