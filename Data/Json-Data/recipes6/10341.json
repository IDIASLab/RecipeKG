Because I already knew it was delicious, I wanted to try this recipe with the bread machine method. Still delicious! Very moist, and subtley flavored by the dill seed (from last summer's garden!).  I had to substitute 1 tsp. onion powder for the minced dried onion and, while it was good, I think I like it with the minced dried onion better so I'll be sure to add it to my grocery list. Might be good with minced fresh onion too! Also, the amount of yeast seemed excessive--I used 2 tsp. of bread machine yeast and I had a perfectly risen loaf.",

I don't know why eveyone is saying that this is a \"half-risen loaf of bread\", because mine rose so much I had to poke it down a little!  I used allot less yeast, 2 tsp (which is what my bread maker usually calls for, so I went with the usual trend).  Also to have yeast rise your bread, you must keep the liquids that you add a little on the warm side; hence, do not put in refridgerater temperature cottage cheese - warm it up in the microwave a little.  I hope this helps those a little who can't get their bread to rise.",

After the ten minutes, I added the melted butter(I don't often cook with margerine, so I don't keep it on hand. I like the taste of butter better.) and cottage cheese and mixed it well with the paddle before adding in all the dry ingredients I wisked together. No dill seed, I used about a 1/2 tsp of dill weed and I'm currently out of dried minced onion, so I used 1 tsp. onion powder. I did add about a tbsp. of oil after all the dry ingredients were combined to help the dough form into a ball and to get it to jump on the hook. I let the hook knead the dough for about five minutes, then set it to rise in a greased bowl covered with a Cover-Up for about an hour. After the hour, I formed it into a loaf and set it to rise again in the loaf pan for another hour or so. I baked it for about 25 minutes at 350*, which is when it smelled done. I snuck a piece......VERY GOOD. I like it's uniqueness. I plan on serving it with Restaurant-Quality Baked Potato Soup tonight.",
