I used chocolate covered candy coated sunflower seeds and the optional coconut which made these especially pretty and different. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to heighten flavor. I refrigerated my dough about an hour used a small cookie scoop not bothering to flatten them at all and found they spread just the right amount - not too flat not too poofy. Nice balance of flavors between the oatmeal sunflower seeds and coconut. I would have to call this a nearly perfect cookie. I dare you to eat just one!",

I added 1 cup raisins & 1 cup very finely chopped sunflower seeds. I used Amish vanilla extract which gives it a nice rich flavor. My children love these and I don't feel as guilty about the sugar and fat when the \"healthy\" ingredients far outway the \"unhealthy\". Sunflower seeds and whole oats are so beneficial to our health and I think most parents would find it hard to get their child to eat a handful of sunflower seeds alone! Great recipe. Will make again next time adding some extra virgin olive oil.",
