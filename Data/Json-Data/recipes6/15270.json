The glaze was perfectly thick for me, keep in mind that cornstarch does not reach it's full thickening power until it comes to a SIMMER.

I reduced the fat by using Neufchatel instead of cream cheese and replacing the 4 Tablespoons cream with a scant 1 tablespoon of 1% milk.  I was out of pineapple juice, so made the glaze with orange juice.  Also added 1 tsp. vanilla and the grated rind of one orange to the crust.  Next time, I plan to try a shortbread cookie recipe for the crust, as the crust was a little sweeter than I cared for. (Everyone else LOVED the crust, as it was).  For the fruit, I used kiwis, strawberries, oranges and bananas (dipped in lemon juice to prevent them from turning brown).  I laid the fruit in diagonal stripes, and it looked like a colorful Mexican blanket... beautiful!",

The cookie \"dough\" which was more like a batter that I had to spread with a spatula puffed up and spilled down over onto to bottom of the oven and burned. After I cleaned that up and cleared the smoke from my kitchen I used an 18 oz. sugar cookie dough. Thank goodness I thought to buy one just in case. The cream cheese and white chocolate formed a very weird slimy consistency when mixed together and I ended up taking half of that and mixing in a half tub of Cool Whip which made it much fluffier and 1/4 cup of lemon juice to take away the sickening sweetness of it. I waited till about 2 hours before I served it to frost it and arrange the fruit so it wouldn't get soggy. I used kiwi strawberries blackberries and mandarin oranges. It turned out wonderful but the original recipe is terrible. What a waste of time and unnecessary stress.",
