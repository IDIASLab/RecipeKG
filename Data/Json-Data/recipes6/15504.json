Some changes that I made and found effective:  for sprinkle mixture used brwn sugar instead of white, used about 2x cinnamon, and added 1/4 tsp cornstarch to make sure the apples juices congeled.  I also zested about 1/4 lemon over the apples and squeeze about 1/4 lemon of juice over them.  For the topping, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and a half cup unpacked brown sugar.  THIS MADE IT VERY Excellent.  The crust came to a dark golden brown and was so yummy.  I will definitly make this soon again.",

This did need modifications: I sliced 5 apples (1/2 fuji, 1/2 granny smith).  Only used the 2.5 cups the recipe called for but wish I had used all 5 apples. I used real butter, a pinch of cardamom, 1/2c brown sugar Splenda and 1/2c white sugar and the pecans. Also used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. Sprinkled 1/4 tsp lemon juice and cornstarch over the apple/cinammon/sugar mix. I believe I overbaked it because it ended up with a cookie/brownie consistency, but was still delish with vanilla ice cream.  Next time I will use more apples, decrease the baking time and the amount of sugar and butter. The butter would probably be better if not fully melted. This recipe can be made in a deep dish pie plate or a spring-form pan.  Looking forward to making this again & again with 5-star results. ",
