I added extra spice: 1 tsp ginger. I also skipped the walnuts since without nuts these bars could be considered lowfat. I cooked these bars for 25 minutes and that was enough. The texture of these bars isn't ideal but the taste is nice. I'd probably put a bit less sugar (3/4 c) in next time and sprinkle some powdered sugar on top. A decent lowfat snack cake",

I also used a Cream Cheese Frosting.  The bars were a huge hit at a church gathering last night.  The next time, i will add 1/2 cup more shredded carrots and add 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.

I read the reviews followed others and made a few changes to bring calories down. Sweetening with stevia extract I ve been doing for a few years. There is no bulk in the extract I used C applesauce which is also a switch used in baking for oil or fat so I also passed on the butter. Recently read an article about health benefits of pineapple. Someone chose to drain pineapple and add to this. I didn t think to look at the size of can the person used I had a 20 oz. can (ugh a lot to add!) When draining it the pineapple juice = I cup SO I used the juice instead of water. No raisons in the house dried cranberries that are sweetened. The extra volume with the 20 oz. Pineapple I used 1 C oat flour and 1 c oat bran. These turned out good not too sweet texture like a brownie. The cranberry carrot combination is very good. Next time I will double the spices. About losing weight eating no dinner or very little has shed 10 pounds in 3 weeks. These will make good breakfasts.",
