The only thing I did different was not use tomato juice.  I mixed some canned tomato sauce with a carton of chicken broth.  Next time, I will season it up a little more to suit our tastes, maybe use spicy italian sausage instead of mild, but as written, this is very good.  We liked it! To the reviewer named punkin...the rice is wet because it was rinsed...not cooked.  Also, I did not use the water from the cooked cabbage.  I personally don't think it would add any significant flavor  but if you need more liquid in the pot, it's right there.",

Stove top, shorter cook time needs longer time to soften rice. Ground pork (not Bob Evans type breakfast, spiced sausage) should be used. Don\u2019t form very tight meatballs, to let rice expand. Paprika, 1 to 2 T. Mix in filling. Put bigger leaves on bottom of pot. No need at all to save cabbage water. If your V8 and tomatoes WITH juice don\u2019t just cover rolls, add a little water to pot. Bring to just boil and then let simmer about two hours.",
