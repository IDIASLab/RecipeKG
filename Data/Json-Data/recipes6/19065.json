Like others I was a bit skeptical but overall it's really good. It tastes like a meatball hoagie fused with a hard shell taco. So if you like both of those you're bound to like this. My husband is a fan of both so he really enjoyed this. Plus it was quick and easy to put together for a weeknight meal. I seasoned the ground beef and sausage with a little minced garlic as well as Italian seasoning. I omitted with sugar from the jarred sauce as I used \"Classico's Sweet Tomato Basil Sauce\". I topped the \"tacos\" with a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Overall simply delicious!",
