This is a great tart and spicy way to use some up of those seemingly endless loquats. Recipe would work well with pork too. Loquats are very much a seasonal fruit. Late spring to early summer is the only time of year you can find them. Pairs very well with rice.",

I just wish I had of found this recipe sooner.( Like at the beginning of the season we have 3 huge Loquat trees and I was determined this year to find something to do with this amazing fruit. This recipe reminds me of my homemade Orange Chicken. A family FAVE. I did some variations I didn't have OJ so I used lemon juice and coconut water no lemon pepper dash of Himalayan salt dash of ginger because it does get overwhelming pretty quick dash of cinnamon 1/4 cup of Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar and a dash of soy sauce. while I was letting the sauce simmer I fried my chicken pieces in corn starch in flour with just reg. Veg Oil. After they were finished I put them in with loquat sauce which by now was nice and sticky let it set together for about 10 minutes so the chicken could absorb the flavor. I had some stir fried cabbage and ate it with that it complimented the stir fry very well. I will be making this again soon only next time I will be using frozen loquats hopefully it taste as yummy.",
