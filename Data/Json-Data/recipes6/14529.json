Even my husband who normally won't eat strawberries had only good things to say. I did not find it dry at all it just tasted like cornmeal as one would expect. As a side note I used regular (i.e. bleached) flour and vanilla yogurt because that's what I had on hand and these worked fine. Simply a perfect way to use those summer strawberries!",

It was the right amount of not too sweet had a dense sponge cake texture and the perfect hint of cornmeal. The only thing I changed was to sub sour cream for the yogurt since I was out. The fresh strawberries (or any fresh berries) are a must so don't leave them out. The Hubster loved this cake! Served with a scoop of vanilla/strawberry ice cream. Yummy!

I also try to avoid using white sugar, so instead I put in 2/3c. of brown sugar.  I had a slice with some vanilla ice cream while it was still just slightly warm and it was delicious.
