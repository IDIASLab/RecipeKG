You really have to get all natural maple syrup that actually came from the tree. Makes a world of difference. I added wheat germ to get some nutrients in there. :) Nobody notices.

We just had this for breakfast this morning. I made it with a few common changes in baking: replaced half the butter with applesauce.  Lowered the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup, maybe a little less (did not measure).  I added an apple and some chopped pecans as someone suggested.  I stuck WITH the maple syrup and sued Canadian because well, it is a healthy edulcorant imo. When I mixed it all, it was a bit of a dry-looking mix, so I added one egg, which I had use in other oatmeal recipes.  What is outstanding about this is the flavor.  With the nuts, maple and cranberries, it is just... old school.  Barely sweet, nutty, cinnamoney, and yummy.  Hats off, joshllorio :)",
