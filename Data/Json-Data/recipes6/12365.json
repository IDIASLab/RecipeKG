The trick to making these best is to keep the size small.  The first batch I made the drops were about a table spoon in size and they got hollow with a gummy center.  My second attempt I used almost level teaspoon size drops and they were truly amazing.  When they come out bite sized they just melt in you mouth.  I also agree that there is no need for more then 45 minutes of cool down time in the oven after cooking.",

I made 13 bigger cookies and put them all on one sheet only about two cm apart baked them for the hour and then let them lit in the oven for about 30 minutes and they're perfect! The outside is nice and crunchy and the inside is soft and sticky (but not under cooked) but then once ya start chewing it the outside melts in your mouth and the inside is wonderfully chewy. When the cookie's nearly gone it actually tastes like a chewy brownie! I've already eaten three of the cookies and these are a repeat for sure! So easy to make so good so good for you... I think I might also experiment with leaving out the cocoa (though it was excellent) and adding cinnamon chips instead of chocolate.",
