                "reviewBody": "I made this on the weekend and was pretty pleased with the result. I think my ratios were a little off (since squash can vary in size so much) but it was very flavourful. The vegetable broth I picked up was a low sodium package and I think in future I would get a regular one or possibly even chicken broth to enhance the flavour a bit. I left out the cayenne and used dried herbs other then the parsley. The only intentional substitute I made was using crab apples instead of granny smith (using some of the bounty in our yard) I cut up four largish ones which seemed to be the right amount for 2 regular apples. I started making the recipe a little later in the day then planned so my soup only simmered about an hour and a half. It would certainly benefit from a longer period but I don't think it negatively impacted my result. I expect that freezing the leftovers will bring the flavours together even better. As stated in some other reviews this recipe does take a while to make and requires a fair bit of prep but it is not as difficult as some have made it out to be and not as intimidating as the first read of the recipe may suggest. Once I had the squash in the oven and the apple mixture cooked up I chopped all the other ingredients and set them aside in bowls. When the squash were finished I simply had to puree everything and add it all together. Simmering of course takes a while but the prep was all done before the squash had finished roasting and it really only need",
