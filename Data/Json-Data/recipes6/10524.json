You must know your oven and if repeatedly burning a recipe does'nt know their oven!  All are different. Change the temp. and heat distr., turn the fan on to distr. the heat around, change pans. I found this recipe so simple and convenient and made money selling them at cafes around. You have to know what makes a muffin moist. Always add some fruit or veg. like banana, carrot, zucchini, and an extra egg. This ensures moist muffins, which I found this recipe worked best for. You need to start with a high temp (200 C) and then lower after 7 minutes to 175c. This is imp. for getting a peak in the center and also aids in allowing the center to cook. The lowering heat will ensure it doesn't burn. This is just advice that I aquired from lots of research and trial and error. It takes practice to be a master with baking. As much experience as I have I have also blundered. I've gone back after a few years to a recipe I had no success with and had excellent results because I have more knowledge of kitchen science. \nGood luck, and thanks Helen for a great recipe.",

I did not have to add any milk to this batch but I did have to add some to the banana bread.  Also, my kids have made chocolate chip muffins.
