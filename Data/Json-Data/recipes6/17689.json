My cake was very brown after 30 min but it was still raw inside...it took 50 min to bake completely so all the edges ended up being really brown (after 30 min I turned down the oven temp to try and prevent over-browning). The cake itself was also brown on the inside which I thought was strange. It had an ok texture but it didn't have much of a pineapple flavor and wasn't very sweet. Maybe using pineapple in syrup instead of natural juice would have worked better. I'd also do it at a lower temp. right from the beginning if I were to make it again. On the plus side it was easy to make and there wasn't much clean-up required!",
