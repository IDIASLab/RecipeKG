As a safety precaution we tempered the eggs by first heating 1/2 of the milk and slowly pouring it into the egg and sugar mixture while whisking the eggs constantly. Then proceed with the cold ingredients (and vanilla). This will raise the temperature of the eggs so it is safe for children and pregnant women to drink. That being said I also left out the rum and served it on the side: ). This received rave reviews from all! Thanks for sharing!",

It was my first eggnog I have made coquito before (and realized I love it more) but this recipe is different from coquito. The texture was creamy and milky. I used less sugar and less rum (white rum) but I think spirit gives an extra kick and makes the eggnog tastier. In my opinion this eggnog needs more spices so I added cinnamon cloves and nutmeg in the bottle. Overall this is a delicious eggnog and easy to make too.",
