I used only one egg for the filling, we raise Muscovy and their eggs are about 1 1/2 times larger than an extra large egg.  We are all out of parmigiana so I was left to use an alternate cheese. Other than that kept it the same. The family really enjoyed the recipe and made us feel like we were out to eat instead of being stuck at home! Can\u2019t wait to try a different filling next time!",

Not sure if I did a bad job with the kneading (Bad technique), the mixing (too dry), or the baking (the wheels may have been too tightly bunched in the pan). This is our first Chef John recipe that failed to meet expectations, but he did say it was all about technique so I forgive him. After all, I am a disaster at making my pasta.",
