I can not say enough how this absolutely made my pizza delicious rather than just good.  The only thing I changed was I tasted the sauce as it was simmering, and I added about another teaspoon of dried parsley, another teaspoon of dried basil, and about a tablespoon just of Italian seasonings blend, otherwise the sauce was too tomato-y.  It also made A LOT of sauce-next time I'll probably just use the 28oz can of tomato puree but all the extra seasonings.",

Am I ever glad I did - the sauce tastes incredible!  It has just the right mix of tomato flavour and sweetness, and using whole tomatoes and chopped onions adds a lot of chunkiness to it.  It makes a LOT of sauce too; I'm going to freeze the leftover sauce, and it will probably be enough to last me for the next few months (although I may want to make pizza more often now, so maybe it won't last quite that long!).\n\nThanks very much for an excellent recipe.",
