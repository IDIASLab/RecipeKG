I tripled the recipe so I could freeze some for a later date.  The amount of spice is perfect, would not change one single thing!  Thank you for bringing my Mom back to me with this sauce!  Addition made to my review 11.08.09, why some reviewers make changes before trying the original recipe is beyond me..how can you review and rate a recipe that you have not tried?  Try the original recipe then review and rate it..give it a shot before you pass judgement, all recipes are to ones taste, if you do not like spicey sauce, than this one is not for you! You should not try this one and give it a bad review if you do not like spicy sauce .....it is SPICY sauce, anyone can see that from the ingredients.",

I made this last night for dinner, it was incredible!  Here's the only things I changed up...I used 1 lb grass fed ground beef and 1 lb ground buffalo (great quality meat makes all the difference).  Sauted the onions and garlic in a non stick pan with no oil then added to fully cooked meat.  Instead of tomato paste I used 2 cans diced italian tomatoes, fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I was worried about adding the full 2 TBS red pepper flakes based on other reviewers adding 1 and saying that was more than enough so I added 1 1/2 TBS and it was great I think it would be delicious with the full 2 TBS but you do really have to like spicey which we do.  Added a shake of garlic powder along with the other spices and I let it simmer for over 2 hrs just because that makes it so flavorful and the meat so tender.  Served it on top of whole wheat spagetti with a side of whole wheat beer bread to sop up the sauce, PERFECT!  This would also make an awesome lasagna sauce or if you keep the recipe as is with the tomato paste it would be a great pizza sauce. If you love a little kick to your food I HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe!!!!!!  OOps almost forgot...I cut the salt by half.",

I too will cut the salt at least in half next time and will leave out the red pepper. My 6 year old loved the flavor but after about 2 bites couldn't eat anymore. This is after I added lots of Splenda to tone down the heat and it did add a nice sweet flavor. I also had to keep adding water because it was very thick. I will make this again and again with these modifications. Served over whole wheat rotini.",

I used brown sugar (the recipe did not specify which to use I made a judgement call) I went light on the red pepper flake I used fresh mushrooms and did not add the full amount of salt. I also added fresh ground black pepper. This simmered most of the afternoon and the liquid evaporated quickly. I did throw in one can (undrained) diced red tomatoes and a little red wine in an attempt to add more liquid which was just what it needed. Very good sauce--smells wonderful.",
