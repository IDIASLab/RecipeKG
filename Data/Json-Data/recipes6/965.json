I opted to save time and microwave the peanut butter and honey in a glass bowl for 30 second incriminates for about 2 minutes...then you can just toss all the ingredients in one bowl. These are really tasty! There is a yummy  nutty flavor and if you use sunflower seeds that are salted the flavor pops even more! A definite keeper and recipe that I will make often!!",
