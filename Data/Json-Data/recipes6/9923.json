Rinse chicken pieces and place in large pot or bowl and add a couple of tsp. of baking soda (this takes the blood out of the bird)and fill with water until covered for 15-20 min.  Drain and rinse and refill with water again.  This time place several teaspoons of iodized salt and add chicken back to water.  Refridgerate for 3-4 hours or overnight if desired.  This seasons the meat so that you will have a flavorful and juicy bite each time.  Good Luck",

                "reviewBody": "This reminds me of the fried chicken I enjoyed growing up in south Ga.  I give the recipe 5 stars as written, but I have a few suggestions, which come from my Nana.  1.  Use peanut oil.  It heats at a temp higher than other veggie oils before it burns. This creates fried chicken that isn't greasy, has a crispy outside and a moist inside.     2.  Some reviews mention trouble in getting the coating to stick.  Instead of soaking the chicken in evaporated milk, soak it in a combo of buttermilk and a few beaten eggs.  Something about this causes the coating to stick well.  3.  If you want a thick coating, do the following, and have patience because it takes a little bit of practice.  Take a piece of chicken out of the buttermilk and let the excess drain back into the bowl.  Place it on a plate and dust with the flour mix.  Using a spoon or fork, gently press the flour onto the chicken. Turn the chicken over and repeat.  Using tongs or a fork, very quickly dunk the chicken back in the buttermilk and coat again.  It's important to not use your fingers because they will remove more of the coating you'd just put on.  4.  Even if you don't want a thick crust, consider making a lot more of the flour mix. Until you get the hang of coating, it's easy to go through a whole lot of flour.   5.  Place in the oil skin side down, preferably spaced so that the pieces don't touch. 6.  Fry on medium high heat for at least 20 minutes.",

The only changes I made were to use crisco for frying and to double-dip the chicken pieces in both the egg/milk mixture and the breading. I also soaked my chicken overnight beforehand in buttermilk, which gives it a wonderful, juicy tenderness, and like other reviewers I added extra of all the spices.  I then used the extra flour mixture to make gravy from some of the drippings...it was great!  I browned the chicken on both sides, then put it in a 380 degree oven for 1/2 hour, and this helped to eliminate the over-browning some other reviewers commented on.  It was wonderfully crispy and delicious, and even better cold the next day!",

I served this with homemade garlic mashed potatoes sweet tea and wheat pita bread. DELICIOUS!!! The only changes I made was to use 8oz. whipping cream and approx. 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I think the thickness of the cream made a big difference in the crunchiness of the skin. Next time I make this I'm going to try double dipping the chicken in the milk mixture and flour to get extra crispy skin. You've gotta try this recipe!",

Heat 3/4 inch oil in a heavy frying pan (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high heat until it gets to 350 degrees F. Use a 2-inch-deep pan if possible to reduce spatters. When oil is hot shake any excess flour off the chicken and add the pieces to the pan a few at a time. Don't allow the pieces to touch in the pan. Fry the chicken in batches if your pan won't hold them all with space to spare. Cook the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes per side. Regulate the heat as the chicken cooks keeping the oil temperature below 375 degrees - use a deep-frying thermometer to the check the temperature.",

I did use Johnny's seasoning salt instead of regular salt(I'm loyal if anything)and I did add 1/4 cup of cornstarch to the flour mixture just because that's what I was always taught to do when making fried chicken. I just cut back on the flour by a 1/4 cup. I baked my chicken just about a half hour AFTER THE FRYING STEP only because I like to be sure my chicken's done.
