For extra richness you could even replace the milk with heavy cream. Don't worry about the raw eggs they cook in the milk since its heated to 165 degrees! If its too sweet simply cut the extra sugar and just go with the sugar in the choc chips!",

I have not heard of using milk in a mousse recipe and so I did not even attempt to try. I also use a food processor instead of the blender because I found that you get that creamy texture quicker and easier. Instead of rum I have used Bailey's or Kahlua so good! I mix the mousse pour it into martini glasses and place in the fridge. It is ready in about 4 hours. For those who have said this is too rich of a dessert and didn't like it THAT is what chocolate mousse is! A very rich and decadent dessert. This particular one is not as light and fluffy as I like therefore the 4 stars. However it is really yummy and so easy. I have made it for 2 dinner party's and it was enjoyed by all! Hopefully this will help!",
