My favorite kind is Toasted Almond with Cranberries. I use about a cup of toasted, slivered almonds, and a handful of dried cranberries chopped fairly small for a sprinkle of color and tartness. I use 2t of almond extract in place of the anise extract and 1/3 cup of milk (or half and half) in place of the brandy. I leave out the anise seed. \n\nOverall, this is a very simple, so-far-foolproof biscotti recipe that is easily adapted for use with whatever ingredients you have on hand.

I made only a single loaf and upped the extract to just over a tsp and 2 Tbs anise seed. I think next time I'll add another half tablespoon of seed and a few more splashes of extract. Also used 5% cream for the liquid per Sweetooth instead of brandy and it worked great. I am brand new to biscotti as of this recipe and if you are too MAKE SURE YOUR LOAVES ARE FLAT. Mine was too tall had to bake it too long (so the ends dried up)and when I went to cut the middle still wasn't completely baked through so the tops of my cookies crumbled. This is why I do test batches:)",

We made a pot of coffee after dinner tonight and he downed several of these biscotti...I ate one or two. While the biscotti are tasty enough to me they lack something...seems like a key ingredient is missing! As a child I often made Anise Biscotti with my beloved mom and the anise flavor was really intense which I like a lot. To me these biscotti are flavorful but way too light on anise. I calculated the recipe to make half the amount of servings as written (I yielded about 26 biscotti) and doing so I actually DOUBLED the anise extract from the ORIGINAL recipe that yields 60 biscuits (I used 3 teaspoons of anise extract). I also used 2 full heaping tablespoons of anise seed for my dough recipe even though I halved the original recipe. Perhaps working with the dough and the biscotti for an hour or so dulled my sense & taste for anise! At any rate I will definitely be making these biscotti again but I'm gonna tweak the recipe a bit. Also just as a mention...the dough is very wet sticky and rather difficult to work with. Rather than wet my hands etc I just floured my board and my hands really well before turning out the dough & prior to shaping it. On parchment paper that I placed over my cookie sheet I used a long floured carving knife to sorta mold and push the dough into 2 long and low log shapes. Doing all of this made working with the dough much much easier.",
