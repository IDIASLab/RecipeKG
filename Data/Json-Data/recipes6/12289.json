This will keep them soft. I made the glaze in a double boiler this allowed me to keep it warm and not burn it. I didn't get the glaze up to 230 as suggested but I did get it up to 200. It turned out fine. I substituted candied pineapple for the citron since that was the only candied fruit available this time of year. It gave the cookies a nice citrus flavor. I may even try candied ginger in the future. My mom also told me after I made them that you can substitute orange zest and juice for the lemon. This recipe is a definite keeper.",
