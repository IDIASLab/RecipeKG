I don't have celery in the garden so I leave it out everything else I have. Oh no fresh dill either--I use the dill seed I saved earlier this summer. And I don't put in the tofu. It's really great w/o it. I bet it'd be great w/it too but I never have any on hand(or veggie broth). This freezes great. I make a big batch or two and eat it all winter long out of quart jars in the freezer. Cracked pepper and a dollop of sour cream and I'm good to go. Thanks for sharing!!",
