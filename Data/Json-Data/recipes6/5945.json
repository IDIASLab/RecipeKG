        "description": "Fun, sweet chili for fall...or any time of year. Chili can be a fun and flexible dish. Add more or less of the ingredients (or add something totally new), and it will usually still taste amazing. I guess I've never kept track of the time it takes to cook this recipe. It's not super fast. I've never paid attention to the exact amount of servings either. It makes a large bowl I bring to parties. Garnish with shredded cheese if you like.",
