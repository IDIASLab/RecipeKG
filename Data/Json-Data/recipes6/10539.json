Perfect!  ** Update: We did the same as previous suggestions- only use 1/2 the amount of shortening and use butter for teh other 1/2 remaining amount. Definitely makes these much more flavorful. WOW! We just made these today for breakfast. We followed recipe exactly. My one recommendation - you MUST have the biscuits touching the other biscuits on the cookie sheet as they bake. We have made 2 other recipes and didn't put them to each other and they didn't rise. We put these together and they were perfect! I am beyond thankful for this recipe! No more Grands biscuits for us- they don't even compare to these. Thank you so much Karin! ** Also- this allrecipes.com site is the best **",

I used all butter and brushed the tops with milk.  They are similar to the baking powder biscuits I have been making for 40 years but the yeast is a really nice change in flavour.  These biscuits stay fresh longer than regular baking powder biscuits.\n\nP.S.  I tried this recipe again, adding grated cheddar and finely chopped green onion tops.  They were fabulous!  I will post again when I try a different flavour.  As I don't drink buttermilk, I keep on hand buttermilk powder bought in bulk.  It was a good substitute because I was able to reconstitute it using warm water.  I found it best to spread out the biscuits so that the ones in the center would brown.  I use shiny pans with parchment paper so that may make a difference to the browning.",
