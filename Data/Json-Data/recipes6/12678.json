I knew I was taking a risk when I picked this recipe though. They are much too moist and dense to be madeleines as is. My suggestions: beat the eggs and sugar until they are thick and fluffy (5 minutes should do). Whisk together the baking powder and flour then sift and fold them into the egg mixture. This should help fight the denseness that might be a problem.",

To begin I changed the recipe yield to 36... and I got 60 (which is great because I inevitably eat some while baking). I followed other reviews and beat the eggs and sugar until frothy and I sifted the flour and baking powder twice. I used 1/4 tsp more vanilla and slightly less lemon & zest in my batter. I used an electric mixer so the batter was moving as I added the room temperature butter and the dry ingredients. All of that extra air really made for light cookies. My mold was already non-stick but I used a light spray of baking spray with flour EACH time I filled the molds and wiped out the crumbs after every batch. I used about 1 1/4 tsp. batter per each mold baked for 9 minutes @ 365 degrees on convection/bake mode and the cookies were perfectly golden on the edges and had a springy texture in the middle. When the cookies are completely cool I dipped them in melting chocolate and let them harden on a wax paper lined tray. They were very dramatic looking.",
