It's simple to prepare, but requires a bit of organization while assembling/cooking, because it goes quickly. Preparing your ingredients beforehand is key! For vegetarians, you can make this without the chicken and fish sauce and it tastes just as good! Serve hot. You could also garnish this with chopped unsalted peanuts.",

I added some fresh yellow zucchini, browned up 1/2 a sweet onion (seasoned the onion with some honey, pepper, and garlic salt) with the chicken. We were out of chili garlic sauce so I added 3 small cloves of fresh garlic and replaced with two tablespoons sirachi. We love spicy but this didn\u2019t make the dish spicy at all in my opinion. I also used chunky peanut butter and still garnished with crushed salted peanuts. Lastly, I used authentic frozen Udoon noodles (cook for about three minutes until they heat up and separate). Delish and can\u2019t wait for leftovers today!!!",
