I used 4 cups vegetable broth and 1 cup beef broth (had to get the meat flavor in there a bit!) I used 2 carrots and might even add more since I like carrots in soup. I did add the peas and thought they were a nice touch. I cooked down the wine before adding the broth but I thought the broth still had too much residual wine flavor for me so might cut back on that some next time.",
