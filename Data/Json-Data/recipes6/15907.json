I used a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish and it took over 90 minutes to bake. The resulting pudding was still mostly egg with a little bit of rice thrown in. The rice was all at the bottom. I spooned some of that layer out topped it with cinnamon and it tasted very good but was still very eggy. This recipe needs major revisions to make it work.",

There is something WRONG about this recipe. First 7 is WAY too many eggs. Second this rice \"soup\" requires at least a 3.5 qt dish. Third a 300 degree oven will barely dry sliced bread how can it cook a giant quiche (which is really what this is)? Fourth 45 minutes is laughable. I had to leave it in there least an hour just to get enough thickness to stir it (so the spattering of rice wouldn't settle at the bottom). I threw it in for another 45 at 325 and it was still undercooked separated and inedible. Stove top seems the better way to go.",

I beat the eggs well first and added the vanilla sugar (only 1 cup) and the milks to it and beat again I even beat in all the rice I had.(hand blender) Baked it at 350 for 45 min(wasn't sure if it should be covered or not so DID cover for half that time.) It was all separated like many of the reviews said the rice was all at the bottom just stirred it up well and Voila! a lovely creamy rice pud!! YUM. There must be an easier way to bake a rice pudding tho' thus only 4 stars.",
