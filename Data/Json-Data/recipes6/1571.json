I plugged in my slow cooker to heat up put my soaked beans in the pressure cooker to cook and in the meantime cut up the onion and garlic. All ingredients went into the cooker with a little water to get it mixed in nicely then I added the beans once they came down from pressure. 4 hours on high should be enough but you can go longer to get a thicker consistency. I added salt near the end of cooking. My 5 year old ate a very large portion of these!",

The only change I made is that I cut back on the molasses because we do not like our beans overly sweet. Not sure we cared for the cinnamon in these but loved the apple cider vinegar. Seeing how I am not a Vegetarian I will add cooked crumbled bacon to the top of each serving the next time I make these.",

I assume this is why it took a couple extra hours to cook or maybe it's my altitude (mile high) \n\n2) In the interest of controlling my sugar intake I replaced the brown sugar with the juice of one can of pineapple slices (about 2/3 or 3/4 of a cup)\n\n3) I added salt to taste throughout the cooking process. The recipe does not call for salt but it NEEDS it.\n\nOverall, there is no pineapple flavor from the sugar substitution and the beans came out tasting AMAZING! I will definitely do this again.\n\nNote: The baked beans I made with this recipe look nothing like the photo at all. They look dark and baked and delicious much like how baked beans usually look.",
