It can turn any dish from ordinary to extraordinary with its perfectly balanced, intense flavor of sweet and tangy. It adds a beautiful, deep pop of color to any dish to create a perfect, professional presentation. I make a large batch and have it on hand in the fridge at all times. Once you start adding this glaze to dishes you will become addicted and crave its intense flavor.",

However, this recipe should come with some kind of bio-hazard warning.  Be aware that MAKING THIS RECIPE WILL FILL YOUR KITCHEN- AND TO SOME EXTENT YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE- WITH FAIRLY NOXIOUS FUMES.  If you have a vent in your kitchen that vents directly to the outside (which I don't) you might be OK; otherwise I recommend making this recipe outdoors if possible.  Also, the smell while cooking is not pleasant and lingers all day, so I wouldn't make it on the same day that guests are arriving.  However, again, I do like the glaze- it tastes like molasses combined with uber-vinegar.",

Also, I added three whole sprigs of rosemary. Due to the higher sugar content you have to watch for it becoming too hard by frequently testing with a small amount on a cool plate.  If it is hardening too much just add a touch of balsamic vinegar.  Turned out beautifully.  This is great for all types of recipes or just with olive oil and bread.",
