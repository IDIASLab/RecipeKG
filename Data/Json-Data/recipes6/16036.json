I guess I was in a creative, experimental mood and so I tried a different recipe. I thought it was quite good, as did the others at the Thanskgiving table, but we all agreed I should stick with the good ol' Libby's pie. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Everything you'd want in a pumpkin pie is right here in this classic and traditional recipe--smooth and velvety  texture, the perfect blend of spices, and it always turns out great. There was really no reason to  try a different pumpkin pie recipe in the first place, and there's still no reason to try another pumpkin pie recipe. This will resume its place on the Thanksgiving table next year! (Many years ago my mom told me to add a couple tablespoons of rum, and I've always thought it made this pie just a little bit better :)",

However, I do not like soggy pie crusts so I solved this problem years ago by adding 1 Tab. instant flour to this filling and making it \"crustless.\"  The consistency is still just as creamy, and it slices beautifully.  Just be sure and butter your pie plate.  I bake it at 350 for 55 mins.(center should be set and when pie is shaken gently, should not jiggle.)   Saves a LOT of calories and fat grams!  I make this pie all year round - not just during the holidays.  Try this method; it will work for you!",

I do add a little nutmeg and I go kinda heavy on the cinnamon because I like my pies spicy. I also cover the edges with foil for the first 25 minutes to prevent the crust from burning. This year might try adding a little vanilla too.",
