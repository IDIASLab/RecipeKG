The next time, I added cocoa powder for a chocolate peanut butter muffin---super!!!  I used spelt flour as the only flour when making just the peanut butter muffins, and a combination of spelt and rice flours for the other ones.  Both times, I used only  1/4 cup honey in place of the brown sugar.  These were gobbled up right away both times!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I found it to be the perfect amount of peanut butter I used all natural peanut butter which I feel ups the peanut taste. Chocolate chips would make this five stars for sure! Update I also made this egg free for a friend and subbed a 1/4 cup of sour cream for the egg Perfect! I think the by mixing the sour cream with the peanut butter it helped incorporate it more and boosts the flavour. The egg seems to be just for binding but I did add a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda because of the acidity of the sour cream all in all a great substitution if you want it to be egg free!:)",
