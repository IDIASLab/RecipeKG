We made several batches, tinkering with the proportions to get the taste and texture just right (for us!)  Peanuts 1 1/3 cups, 3/8 tsp sea salt, 3 tbsp real butter and we decreased the baking soda to 3/4 tsp.  We prefered batches that were fork-teased.  The result was tender, buttery and not too foamy. I also found adding peanuts a little later - two or three minutes after syrup had come to a bubbling boil - helped prevent the nuts from becoming too toasty.  Also fabulous with whole almonds.  Thanks to all above reviewers, you helped!",

                "reviewBody": "One of 2 very similar recipes on here.  Combine the instructions together for best results.  I used 1C of peanuts and would use more next time.  When you add the peanuts the temperature will drop, resist the temptation to crank up the setting on your stove.  Mixture will shortly return to temp and begin climbing.  I think where most have problems is they cook on too high of a setting.  After adding peanuts, continue cooking until it reaches 300 degrees (until it is \"light brown\" is too vague for me when making candy).  Until water initially boils off, temperature will climb rather slowly (this is NORMAL for all candy making), just have to give it a few minutes.  Recipe says to cover for 3 min. but I don't see that matters, the whole point of the initial cooking is to boil off the water.  Certainly recommend a candy thermometer for best/most consistent results since that ice water method is very imprecise unless you have extensive candy making experience.  Would also be great with other types of nuts (i.e. almonds or cashews).  Pour hot mixture on lightly buttered aluminum foil, let sit until cool then break into desired size pieces.",

I always use a candy thermometer, and had read on another recipe to cook it to 300 degrees.  I did that for this recipe, and it turned out with just the correct amount of brittleness.  It's buttery and sugary...tastes wonderful.  Next time, I will add a few more peanuts, but I really love the brittle just as it is.",
