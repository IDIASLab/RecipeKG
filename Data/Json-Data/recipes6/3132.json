That s where the positives end for us. There was so much liquid we had to serve this with a slotted spoon. It had an unappealing murky look to it. Worst of all the kielbasa took on a very strange texture. I could be kind and say it was tender but in reality it was simply soft and mooshy. The flavor overall was fine but the other factors I ve described unfortunately overshadowed that. I believe this traditional dish is best prepared in the traditional manner or slow cooker where not so much liquid is required.",

Then secure the lid and set the instant pot to 0 minutes. It will come to full pressure and then automatically go to the keep warm setting. Let it naturally reduce pressure for 10 minutes and then let the rest of the pressure out of the instant pot. You just have to make sure that you slice your potatoes thin enough that the 10 minutes at pressure will cook them through. 3/4 inch to one inch works fine. This keeps the kielbasa from turning to mush. Now this is only if you are using precooked kielbasa.",
