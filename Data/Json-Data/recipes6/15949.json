I definitely wanted a rich, dark, chocolate cake for these -  so here's what I did: I used 1/2 c. of Hershey's cocoa, 1 Tbsp. of pure vanilla, and replaced the water with strong brewed coffee.  I didn't change a thing with the cream cheese mixture except to add a little vanilla and make sure that the cream cheese and egg were at room temp. just as you do with cheese cakes.  I used foil baking cups to bake these and got 18 cupcakes.  Watch carefully - mine were done in 20 minutes.  Cool and store in the fridge as they're best the next day.",

After 30 minutes - tar-like consistency - same after 35 minutes.  WHAT a waste!  Now I need to go buy a dessert, because these were to be a \"bring the dessert\" dish.

Some observations: (1) The cake part is a little bland - not sure what to do, maybe add more cocoa powder? I would like them to have been more chocolaty so as to contrast with the cream cheese part. (2) Not very pretty... maybe next time I'd try piping the cream cheese mixture in? I thought the black and white parts would magically melt into something beautiful, but they looked like the same messy blobs of white they were when I spooned them in! (3) This recipe does in fact yield 24 cupcakes if you follow the recipe as it's written. I filled the cups up 1/3 of the way with the cake mix and then added a heaping spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and came out with exactly 24 cupcakes, none of which flowed over as others experienced. The cake with rise a good amount and 1/3 full is just right. With some tweaks I will certainly make these again. Thanks for the recipe! ",

I can see why the recipe only wants you to fill the lines 1/3 full of batter they rise so much! I probably used 2-3 tablespoons of cream cheese per each (using the ziploc bag sugg) and a spoonful of cherry pie filling on the very top before baking. It not only makes them delicious but very pretty too. Will make again for sure as everyone was impressed only next time I will double the cream cheese mixture and make 24 cupcakes!",
