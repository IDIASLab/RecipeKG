It is not cooked so the alcohol is not burned off. I wouldn't serve large pieces to children.:-) Also remember the eggs are not coddled so keep refridgerated. I modified the recipe slightly to include a third layer. Very easy recipe to modify. I used 50% more lady fingers another 2/3 cup coffee teaspoon of cognac (Yes I used cognac in lieu of rum) etc. It wasn't an exact science - I eyeballed most of it - but the recipe is really friendly so everything turned out perfectly. Great recipe! Give it a try! One other tip - use a glass pan not metal. Metal will react with your liquor and turn the lady fingers dark green/black. Not pretty.",
