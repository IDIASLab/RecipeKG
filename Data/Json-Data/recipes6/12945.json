My problem is that they're at once too sweet and too buttery. Not usually a problem for me I admit but these are just overpowering. I'd recommend cutting the sugar and the butter to about 1 1/4 cups sugar and maybe less than 1/2 cup butter. The butterscotch pudding just puts too much butter flavor in-- if you use chocolate you could add the butter back in I guess. Maybe if you added some salted peanuts to this it would make a cool salty/sweet treat.",

I added the pudding but also added 1 tsp vanilla and 3 1/2 cups oatmeal. The butter was unsalted and I thought I could have used salt but because the pudding has salt I didn't. I was going to garnish with a salted peanut. After all these alterations my cookies seem sticky and not set but it's only been about a half hour. They are very good kinda like a payday bar. I would make them again. As one of the other reviews I made these to go along with chocolate peanut butter no bakes which did set up and are not sticky. Maybe its the pudding?",
