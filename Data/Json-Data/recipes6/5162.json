This incredibly simple, wonderfully quick, and surprisingly nutritious recipe is perfect to make on cold, wet weeknights. My 7-year-old loves this very lemony, creamy soup, and so do I. If you want a thicker soup, add another half-cup of rice. If you aren't vegetarian, you can saute a few shrimp to add to your bowl.",
