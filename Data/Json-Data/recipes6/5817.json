I really enjoyed the flavour of these pancakes. I think I should have cooked them a bit longer than 3 minutes per side because they felt quite soft in the middle but that's likely due to the difference between wheat flour and rice flour. I used brown rice flour by the way. I reheated the leftovers in the toaster the next day and they were great. They were certainly fast and easy. Thanks for the recipe!",
