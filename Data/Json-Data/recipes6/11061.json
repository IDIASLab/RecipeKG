I did not think it was bland at all. Great flavor, great texture, and so easy to make. Frosted the cupcakes with the Cream Cheese Frosting II - had a bit left over. The two go together very well and many people have asked me for the recipe. Even someone who normally hates carrot cake loved this! I highly recommend it! UPDATE: I have made this recipe many times, in cupcakes and regular cake. It's always a huge hit. In cake form, you can use all of the frosting you make from Cream Cheese Frosting II. UPDATE 2: Still making this 6 years later and still a huge hit. Fills a 13 x 9 pan quite well and baked in 50 minutes. For that size, you need only half of the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe to frost the top.",

The baby food in this recipe takes care of that problem nicely! I've made only this recipe since I first tried it and I have always had a nice moist fluffy cake. I've followed the directions exactly and never had the problem with the cake under-cooking like some people are talking about (and my oven heats on the lower side too). I really recommend this cake!",
