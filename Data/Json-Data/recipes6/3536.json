I'll admit that the making of the cupcakes was different than what I've done in the past (i.e. the traditional creaming of the butter and sugar, beating in the eggs, slowly adding in the dry ingredients, etc.). Nevertheless, I followed the instructions to a T, and ended up with beautiful and delicious cupcakes! I got 20 cupcakes out of this, and they only needed 20 minutes to bake--so watch your time on these. The frosting needed a bit of adjusting, as it was already too dry with just 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar added. So I added in an extra tablespoon of Irish Cream, splash of vanilla, and heavy cream a tablespoon at a time until I got a spreadable consistency (about 4 tablespoons total). This made for some of the best tasting frosting I have ever had! It's amazing! And I got the perfect amount to frost all the cupcakes too! Fantastic recipe, thank you so much! Will definitely make these again!",
