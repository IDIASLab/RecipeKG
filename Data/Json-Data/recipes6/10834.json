This is a smaller version, although it too takes time.  The results taste a little like a Kit-Kat bar. The many layers will remind you of the famous Dobostorte.",

Use the same technique that you use to make a tamagoyaki (put this in youtube to see how its done) a rolled up egg dish. you put a thin batter on the square pan let it cook until light brown as mention on #4 then put in the rolled up aluminum on the top carefully use a spatula and roll it down to the bottom. take the battered aluminum out carefully and do the same thing over again with the cooked batter then putting the battered aluminum on the top and roll it to the bottom again. repeat the steps hope this helps i actually saw this on a cooking/romance series",

My only advice: the almond paste is difficult to mix with the butter/cornstarch/powdered sugar mixture so I grated the almond paste first and then mixed it with a pastry blender. Not hard to make at all once you get a sense of how hot your broiler is and how thin to make the layers (and it's fine if the first few are a little too brown because it's all covered up anyway). It's a total wow dessert and absolutely delicious!",
