The sambal amount was just right and the aroma was mouthwatering. Only thing it was too oily from all the butter. I did thaw the shrimp as directed and it worked!! Thanks for the tip. Will make again and maybe replace part of the butter with broth or not. It was really good as is. Thanks for the recipe!",

I thought \"What can I do with this?\" and randomly found this recipe. Hurrah for random recipes! Really delicious and I will cook it again probably soon. 1. Don't use Uncle Ben's rice save that for Thanksgiving or dinner with your parents. This would taste great with basmati rice or jasmine. 2. I did not have green onions and look forward to throwing them in next time! 3. I used a 1/3 cup of the Sambal Oelek and even that was almost too spicy for me. In the future I'll take it down a notch or two - maybe a 1/4 cup. The lesson here? Adjust to your taste and heat level. And if you can handle the 1/2 cup of Sambal good on you! 4. So much butter in this recipe! Which makes it super yummy but not that super healthy. I'll be swapping some of the butter out for olive coconut or even avocado oil.",
