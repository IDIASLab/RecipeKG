I made the pie filling and just baked it without the crust (too lazy to make crust) or meringue. I followed the filling recipe to a T and it turned out AMAZING! The filling is rick and creamy and the allspice adds an element of spice. Once the filling was baked I let it cool for a little bit then served each serving with a huge spoonful of Haagen-Daz Rum Raisin ice cream! HOLY COW! I will definately make this again! Thanks!",
