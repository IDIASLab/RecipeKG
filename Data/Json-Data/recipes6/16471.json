Mom did not add ground pecans to meringue but I did add far less than the 1/4 cup recommended. The double broiler and \"pinch of salt\" told me it was probably as old as my mom's recipe. I didn't have a double broiler but put a stainless steel mixing bowl over a slightly bigger sauce/dutch oven type pot with boiling water. I chopped in a small processor the pecans for the filling a little coarser than what I would consider \"ground pecans\" would be. I wanted some chopped pecan pieces big enough to chew like I remembered. Next time I will not make the filling as thick as I did this time but it was still raved over. I doubled the recipe and the picture is of the second one that spent the night in the frig that shrunk the meringue a bit. Will definitely make it again... will have too. Ha Ha",
