This will be a treasured part of our family holiday celebration from now on. I grew up on bottled \"Glogg\" but there is no comparison. This is lighter and sweeter with wonderful balance in the spices. I followed the recipe exactly the first time. After we quickly consumed the first batch I tried to \"wing\" it and added too much brandy. The original recipe is just right. Thank you for adding the recipe and helping to start a new holiday tradition in our family!",
