The bread was still perfect. I also didn't have a lemon and left that out. I put extra orange zest and orange juice. I used white and black raisens. My husband can't stop eating it.

I cut the recipe down by a third using 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk and got some of the measurements slightly off (added a little too much butter) but this bread was light and delicious! I left the dough for the final proof in the pan overnight (I could not believe how high it rose) then baked in the morning. I took it to work where a Polish colleague told me I nailed it! Next time I will make the whole recipe and give the extras away as gifts. As good as any bread I have had from a fine bakery. Highly recommend your trying if you are nervous!",
