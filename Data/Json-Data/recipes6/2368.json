To me celery is a bit too crunchy I prefer cucumbers - cut in half de-seeded then sliced into very thin crescents. Carrots are a staple I use a gadget that kind of creates small strings of them. Then the rest is up to what's on hand and personal taste. I've also subbed out the chicken for salmon and it's wonderful!",
