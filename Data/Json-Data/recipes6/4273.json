Next time I will add a little extra salt.  We loved the mild ranch taste ..... so much better than mayonnaise.  We have eaten it on gluten free ciabatta and also in lettuce wraps.  It would also be tasty in a spinach tortilla wrap. Definitely will make again.  Makes for an easy weeknight meal.  Left-overs keep well for delicious lunch on day 2.",

I almost gave it 1 star except the dill gave it a little extra flavor over bland light ranch and unseasoned chicken.\n\nWhat i changed - \n\nSEASON THE CHICKEN  I diced up a chicken breast, added a drizzle of olive oil, some powdered ginseng, salt, and pepper in a bowl and tossed it all to coat the chick then cooked it.\n\nThen I used regular ranch for more flavor, the rest of hte listed ingredients, and tossed that all together.  Then sprinkled salad toppings on (sunflower seeds and bacon bits are what i like) and made this a 4 or 5 star dish.",
