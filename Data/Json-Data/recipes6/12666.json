For those ppl who were a little bit dissatisfied with this one I would recommend trying 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar 1cup creamy peanut butter and 1cup crunchy peanut butter. It will be a bit less sweet but I think more peanut buttery. I sometimes add a handful each of pb and chocolate chips.",

Between the peanut butter chips and double the amount of peanut butter to shortening (it's usually even/steven) these are not short on peanut butter flavor. Just made slight modifications of adding a little vanilla using traditional shortening and creamy peanut butter. They're very good but not outstanding and because they were putzy to roll into balls because of the plentiful chips getting in the way I'm pretty sure I'm not likely to make these again.",
