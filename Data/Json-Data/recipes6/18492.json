After the said 20 minutes, just watch the pearls until they are cooked to your preference. Also, when storing your pearls, coat them with honey or sugar syrup so they do not stick together. If you want flavoured bubble tea, simply add frozen juice concentrate in the flavour of your choice. Keep adding it tsp at a time until it is flavourful enough. Chocolate syrup is also quite good.",

When I make it at home, I would cook the pearls then move the pearls into rice cooker and cook for another 15 minutes until the middle is completely cook.  The pearls aren't fully cook if it still shows a little white dot in the middle.  Once that's done.  Run cold water through it 3 times.  You'll have the most chewy pearls you'll ever taste.  Definitely leave them in honey or syrup so they don't stick together.",

You must use Pearl Tapioca that is made just for Bubble Tea. I recommend cooking the tapioca for 20 minutes and removing it from the heat source. Put a lid on the pot and allow to set for another 20 to 30 minutes. Rinse with warm water it helps get the excess starch off much easier than cold water. I use Coconut Chai tea Almond Milk and Stevia.",

The thing was I should have stirred more because a layer of tapioca pearls got stuck to the bottom of the pot and could easily have burned and ruined the taste. So stir people!! Anyway this works it s awesome for homemade bubble tea! I love the taste I love the bubbles! Oh one more thing! I only used like 3-4 ice cubes. That s enough to chill the beverage to my liking.",

                "reviewBody": "Good attempt at it. Following the advice of the first review these are my insights. - You will probably have to cook the tapioca longer than 20 minutes. I cooked for about 30 minutes. Cook it until the tapioca is transparent. - I used the smaller tapioca pearls and it just wasn't the same as the larger ones. So I highly recommend using the larger ones. But if you do decide to use the smaller ones 1/3 cup felt like overkill for me. 1/4 cup seems like a better portion. - The drink didn't seem sweet enough following the original 4 teaspoons. So you'll need to add maybe up to 6 teaspoons of white sugar or you can add honey to add more sweetness.",
