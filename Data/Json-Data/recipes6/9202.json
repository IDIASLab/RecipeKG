If its a marinade I'll let it sit for about 30 min to marinate. If its a dry rub I may let it sit, I may not. Depending on my time limit. My family, nor myself are picky. Honestly, sometimes I just put 1/2C water and 1T liquid smoke in the instant put and rub the ribs in salt and cook it that way to taste the meat flavor itself.  ANYWAY I don't even put these ribs in the oven, as it is more work and more dishes for me. And I don't like my ribs to completely fall off the bone. I like my ribs to have a little bit of pull from the bone. Feeling like I get back to my true cavewoman roots. haha. Great recipe though as a base, and I'm sure following the full thing is great as well. I have favorited it for sure and use it often! Thanks for sharing!",

I had ribs in the freezer so I seasoned them in the frozen state, popped them into the instant pot and added 20 minutes to the cooking time. They came out just as fabulous as the first time from the fresh state.",
