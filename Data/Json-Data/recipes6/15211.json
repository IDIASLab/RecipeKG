Went back and re-read the ingredient listing and I didn t mess anything up followed the recipe to the letter. To try to salvage it I added more vinegar sugar and wine and still all I could taste was the ground mustard. I think all of the ingredients are right I just have to wonder if the proportions are accurate ground mustard is pretty powerful stuff. Sorry not sure what happened here but this just didn t work for us.",
