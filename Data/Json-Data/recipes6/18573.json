When I first made them I too was expecting the yummy creamy cheese middle that the title leads you to beleive will be there. But no these muffins use the cream chese as a cake, there isnt really a need to do all of the layer work you can swirl it or mix it in.  However here is a little tip, if you are looking for the yummy creamy cheese middle skip the cream cheese directions from this reciped and use this:\n1 tub of cheesecake filling cream cheese\n  (the kind philadelphia has out)\n1 tablespoon vanilla\nadd either powdered sugar or regular sugar to taste.   \nmix it all up  and lay it out on saran wrap and form a long tube shape. Roll it up and freeze it until frozen solid.\n\nthen when you make the muffins, fill the muffin cups 3/4 full with the batter and slice the frozen cream cheese mixture into little puck sizes and push them down into the middle of the batter.\n\nWhen you bake the mixture will give you that yummy cream cheese middle you were looking for... just dont eat them right out of the oven.. HOT!!  ",

Granted these muffins are moist to the point that they are hard to extract from the muffin tins. Indeed if that's a concern maybe bake them a little longer or add a bit more flour? I don't know. I'm not a baker. I added one cup raspberries to the 1 cup blueberries and I'm glad I did. It was a taste explosion. If I were rating this recipe on appearance I might go with four stars; they turned out flatter than many muffin recipies I've prepared. Still if you are looking for taste throw an extra cup of fruit in the batter and be prepared to be awed. The cream cheese angle is genius. Awesome!",

They were so easy to make especially for me since I've only baked from scratch a handful of times. They're very moist and don't crumble and fall apart which is a huge plus for feeding a two year old. It definitely made more than 12 muffins though more like 16 or 17 but that's fine with me. I think if I make these again I will definitely put double or even triple the cream cheese filling I LOVE the texture & taste of the filling and these need more! That's the only reason it didn't get a 5 star in my opinion. Will definitely make these again!",
