                "reviewBody": "As a restaurant owner/chef I can tell you that this is a recipe easily done to your taste. I use 1/2 cup Splenda and one Tbl. of sugar, as we have high risk for diabetes. It's ok to sprinkle precooked bacon to top, but finely chopped, thin bacon cooked well gives you the base you need. I remove bacon and drain, adding to the grease finely diced sweet onion (vidalia or Texas A&M 1016?) I strain off all but 1/4 cup grease.  Too much sugar will turn thick or candied if not watched carefully. Melt sugar over low heat, then bring to a boil. Once boiling, remove from fire.  If you want it thicker, place on heat and add cornstarch at 1/4 tsp at a time, waiting for thickening to happen. I add apple cider vinegar at the end, one Tbl or less at a time. You can always add more but you can't remove easily. Write it down when perfect for you. Sugar or Splenda can be added to taste. We used this dressing over mixed greens, spinach chiffonade, diced white meat chicken, thin sliced almonds or slivered, and fresh quartered strawberries. This way, you get protein, greens, nuts and sweet.\nI have the world's best Poppyseed Dressing which I use over mixed greens, diced chicken, Craisins, sliced almonds, finely diced onions. Yes, I share. It's great over mixed fruit also. Melon balls, cantaloupe, kiwi, grapes, strawberries....but pick your fav. Mix.",

I only used 3/4 cup sugar and added 2 tbsp. bacon drippings as suggested by another reviewer. I also read reviews on this recipe saying it became very thick. I don't believe this is suppose to be a thick dressing. I cooked the dressing over  medium heat, stirring contantly until the sugar was melted and continued cooking for only a couple minutes more. It turned out perfect.",
