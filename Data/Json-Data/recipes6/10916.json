I have been looking for this recipe for ages and am thankful that I finally found it The cake tasted exactly like it did when I grew up in the island of Barbados. Wow!! I have a picture of how it turned out too. I did not hand-mix but used a KitchenAid mixture instead and I had to lower the temperature to 325 because 400 was definitely too high. However the quantities were PERFECT!!!!",

Cut the almond extract to 1 teaspoon. I am going to try making it with one tbs of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of lemon extract and hope for different results- Wish me luck. I baked this cake for one hour at 350 and it turned out nice too bad it tasted terrible!!!! UPDATE: Okay I made the cake with the 1 tsp of lemon extract and WOW what a difference! We could actually eat it this time! It did not have a heavy lemon taste so the lemon glaze/icing I drizzled on it was a perfect compliment. Good Cake - would give a 4 when using lemon extract!",
