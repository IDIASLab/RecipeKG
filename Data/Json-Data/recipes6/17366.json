I did not use the lemon juice instead I put in more vanilla extract, I used 4 eggs instead of 7 and cinnamon grahams instead of plain.  Served with fresh strawberries on top.  This recipe was the best. I was totally in! I have never tasted such a great cheesecake in my life!  It is fluffy and light and tastes unbelievable.  Need I say more.  Don't look any farther this is the recipe for you. p.s. you should divide the recipe into 2 cakes as it is too large for one pan.",

I took other users advice and used a 10 inch pan and it was perfect for the amount. I also cooked it at 325 for about 1 hour and 15 min. It will still be wobbly when you take it out but it firms up with sitting and refridgeration. It came out perfect with no cracks and a really creamy texture. All my ingredients were room temp including the heavy cream and eggs which I think is really important. This is the recipe I will use from now on. It's the best!!",

I used a 11 inch pan, and it filled it perfectly.  The baking time was much too low, and it took a good 4 hours until the middle stopped wobbling, and it was the right temperature inside. I used a waterbath, but that shouldnt affect cooking time THAT much since I had the water hot before I put it into the bath.  \r\n\r\nOverall, it had a good flavor. I added some lemon zest as I wanted it to have a strong lemon flavor, and blended the ingredients together until they were smooth.  The cheesecake turned out very nicely after I cooled overnight. Invented a topping for this that came out very nicely. 1 cup sour cream, 4 ounces cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup of sugar, blended together until smooth. Added to cheesecake after it was completely cooled off, and then let sit in fridge for another 8 hours. Was a great compliment to the cheesecake.",

I used a 10 inch springform and it was coming over the top (puffed up didnt spill out) so I think a 9 inch would be way too small. I took it to a clients house for dinner and she had SECONDS. I put braised apricots on top (Cut them in 1/2 and put unsalted butter and brown sugar on top -under the broiler for 5 minutes) and I was the hit of the night!! This will be the recipe I will use FOREVER! I think New Yokr style is a bad adjective though NY style is much drier this is quite moist.",

My first \"real\" cheesecake and it came out delicious! I followed directions and it still cracked though. Some people said to try the \"pan of water on the oven shelf just under the cheesecake\" technique. Doesn't work. Next time I will try the actual \"water bath\" technique. Wasn't sure then how to do that- everyone assumes you know. For those who don't: Make your cheesecake in a springform pan. Wrap the outside of it in foil(to keep the water out). Get a larger cake pan or shallow casserole dish  (don't grease it). Put your wrapped springform pan into it. Carefully pour very warm water into the space between the two pans (a little over halfway). The idea is to have the middle and the outside of the cheesecake the same temp. If the outside is hotter, it will bake faster and shrink. This causes the cracks. I'll let you know if this works in practice as well as it's supposed to!",
