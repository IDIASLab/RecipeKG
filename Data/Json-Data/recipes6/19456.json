It had a great creamy consistency; not icey at all. I imagine you can make this with any fruit so long as you have about a cup and a half of it. Before serving I run the bag under warm water for about 30 seconds and move the contents around a bit more then scoop out with an icecream scooper. Thanks for the recipe.",
