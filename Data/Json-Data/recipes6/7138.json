I used half beef and half buffalo meat one can each of northern red and black beans an onion a large can of tomato sauce a thing of spicy salsa and then seasoned the heck out of it with crushed red pepper chile powder cumin etc. The cumin gives it much more of a Southwestern Mexican flavor than just the spices. I didn't have any jalapenos on me so instead I used a few Thai chile peppers. I tend to not like my chili overwhelminly tomato-y so this version came out great! I'll probably add more meat next time though. And however insecure East Texans are West Texans are certainly not immasculated by adding a few beans into their dishes.",
