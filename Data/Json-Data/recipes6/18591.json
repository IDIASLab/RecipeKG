Keep mods 1 & 2. Add only 1/4 cup extra pecans and would chop them real fine. There's not enough filling and what filling there is is just too light and fluffy to handle many more pecans imho...... Even if you don't add more pecans chop those puppys fine.:o) I didn't and cutting slices was impossible. A wreck. I had to spoon it........ Nice flavor with mods 1 & 2. Very simple and fast recipe too.",
