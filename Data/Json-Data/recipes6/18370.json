The peach was wrapped in the dough and dropped into boiling water to cook. When they were served you would cut them up and sprinkle them with crushed vanilla wafers, sugar and melted butter. We ate them as a meal even though they sound like a dessert. Again, there are different ways to serve them: my friend's mother sprinkled hers with ricotta cheese and sugar.",
