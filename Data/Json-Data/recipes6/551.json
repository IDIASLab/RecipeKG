I couldn't find blackstrap molasses at one store so I used the Grandma's Original Molasses which has more sugar in it. Because of that I cooked my 2.5 lb bone-in turkey breast at 425 so it wouldn't burn. It took an hour for it to get done. I had almost a cup of the marinade left so I do think it would be possible to get by with less of that (don't want to waste my Jack Daniel's)--even half the amount. I'll find some useful way to use up the marinade! The marinade gets all nice and carmelized in the bottom of the pan from the basting process. I would make this again but not for Thanksgiving unless it accompanied a traditional turkey! Thanks for the recipe 360!",
