I followed the recipe exactly, except for using plain graham crackers instead of cinnamon ones, and carefully pressed the mixture into two glass 9\" pie plates.  I used a wide spoon to smooth the crust and press it very firmly in place.  When I began brushing the beaten egg yolk on( using a soft, long bristled pastry brush), everything started to fall apart!  The sticky yolk just tore up my crust.  It was a very tedious and messy job, and I used both my beaten yolks on the first crust, and it was very unevenly covered.  I decided to put the second crust in the freezer to firm up the melted butter while I baked the first yolky one in the oven.  When it came out of the oven, it was definately well set, and no longer crumbly.  I took piecrust number two out of the freezer and lo and behold it was nice and firm, and the yolk brushing went perfect with no crumbling!  Finished result- excellent crusts!  Just chill before brushing on the egg yolk!",

I used 2 cups of Cinnamon Sugar Oatmeal \r\nCrunch graham crackers (Kroger brand), 1/2 cup melted butter, and 3 T of sugar for one 9 1/2 inch deep dish pie.  The taste was an awesome compliment to the French Silk chocolate filling.  I didn't have a bit of trouble spreading the egg yolk...but I pressed the crust REALLY hard into the plate so I think that may have stabilized it.  Also, it cut and served like a dream!

The egg yolk was hard to brush onto the crust (that's why I gave it four stars), but I actually ended up spreading it easier with the back of a measuring spoon. I wonder if I refrigerated the crust before brushing the yolk if the cold butter would hold the crust together better. Because of the review saying the crust stuck to the pan, I brushed my stoneware pie plate with a very little amount of butter. No sticking! I didn't use cinnamon graham crackers because cinnamon wouldn't fit with the lemon truffle pie. I used organic graham crackers to avoid partially hydrogenated veg. oil. I'll definitely use this crust over and over again.",

Three ideas: I microwaved Imperial margarine (lowest fat margarine)in the pie plate to butter the pan; then used fingers/back of spoon to spread the crumbs so it made the butter disperse and stay together; Hints from Heloise's tip that I use for all pies:  use a whole egg, lightly beaten, and apply with a pastry brush to the bottom only though for this, I followed the recipe and covered the sides as well. This crust was used for a fudge pie...a winning combination of fudge chocolate and a buttery crust. My family raved!  ",
