I liked it and thought it made a good side dish especially since my ham wasn't glazed with anything sweet. The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon of flour to the sugar (I was worried it would come out watery) and I used crushed Club crackers for topping since I had some stale ones in the cupboard. I cut each of the pineapple chunks in half becuase it seemed as though there wasn't much to go around I think the size called \"tidbits\" instead of \"chunks\" would have been the best way to go. I liked the sweet/savory combination of the pineapple and the cheese/cracker topping. I do think I could have cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup it was plenty sweet.",

I think crushed pineapple for the entire dish might have worked out better. I wasn't crazy about the big chunks. I halved the sugar and the sweetness was just right.
