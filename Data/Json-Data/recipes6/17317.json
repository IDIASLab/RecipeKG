I didn't bother with the sauce, sounds delicious but don't need the extra calories!  Would make a lovely dessert with it tho. I used a bit less sugar, some whole wheat flour and added a few extra dates and nuts; also used a medium sized sauce pan and after mixing the date mixture, just added the flour etc to the saucepan...voila saved washing that extra bowl.  Thanks for the yummy recipe, will make many times I'm sure.",

I cut sugar to 3/4 cup, exchange 1/4 cup water with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum which I marinated the dates in for a couple hours, used 2 tsp rum flavor instead of vanilla. Also cut back the butter a bit, maybe 2 tablespoons. Baked for 40 minutes. Turned out very moist & tasty. When cooking the dates, don't allow all the liquid to cook out. Bring them to boil, stir in sugar & butter, then remove from stove. Makes for moist loaf.",

I was going to take this to the school tomorrow and put it in the teacher's lounge but I just had to get into it. I was so suprised---it is amazing! I have eaten 1/2 the loaf already. I can't really taste the dates its more of a nut loaf but maybe that is because I subbed pecans for walnuts. But still---amazing! Very sweet and moist! Had with several afternoon cups of tea (: Thanks for the post!",
