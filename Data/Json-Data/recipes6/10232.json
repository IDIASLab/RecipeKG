I thought the mustard was a little too strong when I taste tested, so I added a little of the artichoke marinade and it really helped level it out. Next time I will reduce the mustard and I think I'll slice the artichokes lengthwise as well, just so they're not so big. I think I'll increase the artichokes to 8oz rather than 6 as well. Definitely a keeper!",
