For the filling I only use 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 4. I end up making almost 10 rolls a year and this year was the easiest because I just started using Parchment Paper. I bake it on the parchment then take it out of the oven and roll it up warm right in the parchment paper. Another thing I found to make the cake spongy and easier to roll is to beat the eggs until they form peaks then add the sugar gradually and beat the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes before folding in the pumpkin (Libby's 100% Pure pumpkin in a can).",

The only difference is that you add 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts or pecans sprinkled over the batter before putting the pan in the oven. Also in the cream cheese filling I throw in a dash of rum for the yum rum in the tum...oooo:) Hint: you must roll the cake while still hot and moist and must let cool completely before unrolling to keep from breaking. I make this at holidays a week in advance and freeze and pull out the day of. And in a pinch you can cheat with with cream cheese frosting out of a can but don't tell anyone! he he",

To make it more attractive at serving time I frosted it with a little filling I have saved to which I added 3T of apricot preserves. You could also use peach preserves or orange marmalade for a great flavor combination.My friends enjoyed the more enhanced version the the original version is delicious too. Thanks Diane.",
