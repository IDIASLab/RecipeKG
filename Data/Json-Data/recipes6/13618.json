(With modern pasteurization,  bacteria and enzymes are already destroyed, so scalding is no longer necessary. Also, it reduces the chances of cooking the egg as the ingredients are mixed). It was a very easy recipe to make. I just threw everything in the bowl, used a mixer for about 1 minute, poured it in the pie shell and popped it in the oven. Only one problem, I can never get more than one slice before it's all gone. Every person who tastes this pie wants the recipe and says it's the best they have ever eaten. Even the people who proclaimed they really didn't care for egg custard pie, changed their tunes rather quickly after the first bite. Thanks for this one!!!",

I added the extra egg yolk (left over from the egg-white wash for the crust) to the filling as well which made for a very rich and creamy filling! It was the BEST!! I was a little nervous about spillover after pouring all of the filling into the crust as it came to the very brim but nothing spilled over and it made the most beautiful pie!!! A keeper!!:)",

I cheated and used a frozen pie crust, the egg white (used the extra yolk in the mix) kept the crust from getting 'gummy' but next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will bake it a little first. I covered the pie edges with foil just in case. I had left over heavy cream so substituted 1/2 cup of that for some of the milk. Add the scalded milk very, very slowly to your egg mixture or otherwise the eggs cook and scramble, and that's why it will taste 'eggy.' I had no problems with water pooling in pie pan - maybe those people had condensation issues, so make sure your pie is cool before placing in fridge. The custard is delicious - it tastes almost like vanilla creme brulee! Thanks for the great recipe!",

My husband had never had custard pie before so I thought \"why not make one for him\". I looked through a lot of custerd pie recipes and this one seemed pretty easy and yummy. So I made it and it turned out perfect. It was silky not spongy and didn't taste like scrambled eggs. I had tempered the eggs like a previous review had suggested doing and I also added the egg yolk left over from the egg wash. I baked it longer then the time had suggested I think I baked it like 20 minutes longer (I can't exactly remember). I had at first thought I had over baked it but when me and my hubby ate later it was perfect. Not watery or having a \"crust\" on top or anything wrong. I was so proud of myself.",
