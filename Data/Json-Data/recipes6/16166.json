The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you this, but after you add the flour and vanilla, you need to cook for about another 10 minutes or so low temp to thicken this into a sauce, otherwise you\u2019ll have something that is the consistency of milk. I ended up adding more flour to thicken it a bit.  Also, take a few spoonfuls of the sauce and put it in a small bowl before you add the flour/vanilla.  Add the flour/vanilla, stir it well, and then add back to the sauce,  Otherwise if you add the flour directly to the hot milk-sugar-egg mixture without tempering it, you\u2019ll end up with lumpy sauce.  The flavor is excellent, and I can see this on so many desserts, particularly bread pudding.  We enjoyed a drizzle of it on a slice of apple pie.",
