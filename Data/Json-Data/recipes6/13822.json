I give this recipe 4 stars because it's quite good but I made a few additions that made it 5 stars.  I added some thin carrot shavings made with my vegetable peeler.  The carrot tastes good with this dressing and adds a really nice touch of colour.  I also added several drops of toasted sesame oil and a tiny bit of cracked pepper.  Just before serving I added toasted sesame seeds.  Everyone loved it :)",

If you use the seasoned variety like I did here, you do not need to add salt or sugar. I simply sliced the cucumber, added the vinegar and grated the ginger and that was it for a fab salad!\nAs a tip, freeze your ginger and take it out of the freezer to grate as necessary (no need to wait to thaw out, just grate and pop the rest back in the freezer). Ginger grated like this will be finer than you can chop with a knife and give a lighter background finish to your dish.",
