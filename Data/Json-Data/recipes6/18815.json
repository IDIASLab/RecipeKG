I added less than 1/4 cup veggie oil and baked at a temp of 350 degrees for 10- 15 minutes longer. It came out very fluffy. I didn't find it too sweet. In fact most Red Velvet Cake recipes call for 1 and 1/2 cup sugar. I also added another tablespoon of cocoa powder and mixed my ingredients differently so that I could stir less.",
