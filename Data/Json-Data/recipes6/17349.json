The 8\" pans make too narrow a cake in diameter, and too high (would not even fit in my glass cake dome holder). The 9\" pans make for a much more attractive and large, more normal appearing cake. And because the cake layers are just a tad thinner, the frosting in between the layers is thicker -- looks beautiful when it's cut and tastes terrific! Just remember to bake the 9\" layers a few minutes less and test with a toothpick. And be sure to use a nice amount frosting between the layers -- the recipe makes plenty.",

I've only made the cake with 9 inch pans, and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers, so when I needed a larger cake, I just doubled the recipe.  I also make sure I make the frosting at least 1 night before I serve the cake because it takes some time for the sugar to fully dissolve, but it is perfect the next day.  I've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy, professional looking.  No one has to know that it started as a mix!",
