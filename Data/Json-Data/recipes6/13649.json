I don't know that I would specifically set out to make it again unless we were entertaining or happened to have fresh beets on hand (I had some from the garden which was my excuse...) However IF I were to make it again I would make the following changes: 1) 1/2 the Dill...maybe even 1/4 it. 2) Choose to use either potatoes ONLY or powdered spuds ONLY...I think the reason someone used the powdered variety was through a last minute attempt to thicken it up...I'd likely go with 4-5 potatoes at the default setting for this recipe. 3) I'd add 2 pounds of beef stew meet or possibly sausage and use beef broth as the base. Finally I found it somewhat confusing how to prepare the beets. Thus I roasted them in the oven after wrapping them with foil for about 35 minutes @ 450 deg F. Then I let them cool a bit peeled them (the skin just sloughs off using this method) then shredded them in the food processor and THEN added them to the pot added the water and brought to a boil. Finally I used the method described (what I'll call the multiple pot method). I found it to be unnecessarily laborious and wouldn't do that again. Overall 3 stars if you follow this recipe...I'm betting a solid 4 and maybe a 5 with my method / some additional tweaking. Hope this helps!",

It makes a nice light soup but filling - and very low in both fat and calories while high in lean protein (with the chicken pieces substituted) and fibre which is hard to come by in a recipe without heavily tweaking ingredients (and most times ruining the entire meal in doing so). I quite prefer this with chicken than sausage or beef as most recipes ask for. Had it tonight with pyrogies and kielbasa... Even my incredibly picky sister gave it an \"Mm!\" when she tried a spoonful. Cheers!",
