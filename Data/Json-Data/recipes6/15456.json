The second time I realized 1/2 way through the recipe that I did not have any evaporated milk in the house.  Since I had company and needed the sauce, I used cream of coconut in lieu of the evaporated milk.  AMAZING!  It added a delicous richness to the sauce both in texture and in taste.  My guests were floored and I will forver make this recipe substituting cream of coconut for the evaporated milk.  The coconut flavor is subtle enough for non-coconut lovers to enjoy.",
