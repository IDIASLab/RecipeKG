I would have given them a 5 except that I found wrapping the dough around the candies to be a bit of a challenge. Be sure to create a complete seal around the candies--otherwise the goo will spill out which is fine if they are just for you (chocolate is chocolate!) but it doesn't work well if you're presenting them to friends or family. Still they are highly decadent even without the white chocolate which I omitted.",

Mine flattened out a lot more and had deep cracks like molasses cookies. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to print up copies of the recipe for the many people who requested it from me. ",

After reading the recipe name he decided he wanted to add these to his offerings. I thought it might be too complicated for him after reading other reviewers comments about the difficulty of the dough. He didn't have any issues getting the dough around the caramels. Of course he made them completely by himself so he may have added or omitted something that I don't know of (lol). I think next time he makes them I will melt down the caramels and put into candy molds to flatten out as the cookies were pretty tall and would come out prettier if flatter.",
