To go the extra mile, after flipping the cake and letting it cool, try adding  home made cream cheese topping:  beat 1 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 t. vanilla; fold in 12 oz. Cool Whip and spread on top and sides of the cake.  You can't get any better than this!  \n(In order to \"flip\" the cake, make sure you have lined the 9 X 13 pan with wax paper and sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray; Cool completely in pan, place large platter or cookie sheet on top of 9 X 13 pan and flip; carefully remove wax paper once cake is flipped. . .it really DOES work.)",

I only changed a few things - instead of yellow cake mix, I used a Cinnamon Swirl mix that I found; I used Pumpkin Pie Spice (instead of cinnamon and ground cloves) and walnuts instead of pecans.  This turned out great, was easy to do and made the house smell just great on a cold fall evening!  Good job, Jacki.",

(the recipe did not mention to, but one review did) so i chose not to since i made it in my only cake pan w/lid. it served well right from the pan i baked it in, i just flipped each piece over as i served it onto a plate.so that the pumpkin pie filling then was on the top and the cake-nut crust was on the bottom. i used a non stick pan and sprayed a little non stick spray in it. even chilled it served fine.  i also used pumpkin pie spice and some extra ground cinnamon and sugar to taste.  great dessert!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This cake was FABULOUS!!  It's like pumpkin pie, but not in a pie crust, because the consistancy is very similar.  I saw this recipe on another website (with frosting recipe included), but that cake lacked the addition of any spices.  So I tried this one instead, with the only change being to reduce the sugar to 1 cup (as per that other recipe).  This cake is so much better if you let it cool for a couple of hours and then flip it onto a platter or cookie sheet, just like you would any other \"upside down\" cake.  That's because the cake mix/pecans/butter work better as a bottom crust, as opposed to them being the \"topping.\"  This will also solve the problem mentioned by other reviewers; that the \"topping\" would get too hard after refrigeration.  It won't if you treat it as a bottom crust and flip the cake.  The pumpkin will keep that crust moist.  And this cake will firm up as it cools and will flip easily IF you lined your pan with waxed paper and coated it with cooking spray.  I also spray the pan before lining too, because it just helps to make the waxed paper stick and hold to the pan better.  See the review that's dated *Dec. 31, 2007* for great instructions.  That reviewer also included the ingredients for a tasty light frosting that's better then your standard whipped cream topping.  Mmm... so yummy!",
