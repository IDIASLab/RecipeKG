I normally say that I don't like much sweetness in my sauces so I was skeptical about the amount of sugar and honey. However this just tasted great. Very flavorful and I would say complex though I may be misusing the term. I used 2 small roasted serrano peppers the first time and that was a nice amount of heat without going too far over the edge. Since then I have made it with the red chile that I have available and it was hotter than the serranos. I'm not sure what kind they are but it's now what I buy. We had a sauce \"tasting\" and this one was the winner. We had it on country style ribs and have enough left to try on some other things. Now we use it on everything including bbq sandwiches. The heat builds quite a bit on a sandwich but we like that. Thanks Don!",

I had to make 2 substitutions based on what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I'm sure if I'd had the proper ingredients I'd still have rated it 5 stars. I used yellow/brown onion instead of red and red pepper flakes instead of the chili pepper. I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and it had a nice amount of heat without overwhelming the other flavors. My family could have had it a lot hotter but I wasn't looking for a fiery BBQ sauce this time. I used it instead of Buffalo sauce on some baked wings. We all liked it and I'm sure I'll make it again. It makes a nice thick sauce that would be good for dipping.",
