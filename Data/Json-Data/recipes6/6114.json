I double the batch because I was making for 7 people and there was nothing but the gravy left behind when the meat was eaten up. I think even if I double the meat and left the ketchup onions and the water the same it would still be plenty. The gravy still tasted like ketchup with a little bit of a nice kick rather mild. Could use some black pepper but other then that. It was fine and my family ate all the meat. TY. I'll have to repurpose the gravy with another meat.",

It needed more time but he couldn't wait it smelled so good! Great gravy and served with smashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing!",
