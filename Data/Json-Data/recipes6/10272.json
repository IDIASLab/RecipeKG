Or More oregano? Or pepper? Made as a side to Happy Roast Chicken tonight (both recipes have Dijon and lemon) and yes! Cooking time says an hour but no - it\u2019s really 90 min or better to dissolve most of the liquid. It may also depend on what else you have in the oven (for me! A whole chicken!). \n\nWhile we didn\u2019t tonight;  Parmesan might be a nice add. Overall, we liked this one but - my preference- I feel like I may need to play a little with this yet.

This one adds mustard (which my usual way of making does not) and it really added something to it.  When I made this dish, I did the addition, but stayed within the parameters of my own recipe (which is very similar, I just add 1/2 cup chicken broth as well and a 1.5 tablespoons of oregano that's the difference in the recipes) and it came out perfect.  The family commented on how good they were and all I did was add a little mustard. LOL",
