True, boxed yellow cake is more moist, but it tastes, well, like boxed cake mix, which is unmistakable and just plain bad. True, scratch butter cakes can have a tendency to be a little dry, particularly yellow butter cakes.  But this yellow cake is definitely better than any I have ever tried in my 50 years of baking--more moist than most, flavorful, and with a light and tender crumb. Cream your butter and sugar well, a good few minutes.  This is key for a light and fluffy cake! Follow the recipe directions carefully--add yolks one at a time, blending well after each addition. Add the flour and milk separately and with a light hand, beginning and ending with the flour. And do not overbake! If your cake is dry or dense you are not following the directions. I made half a recipe in an 8x8\" pan and frosted it with half a recipe of \"Buttercream Icing.\" I challenge you to find a better yellow cake with buttercream frosting in any well-respected neighborhood bakery, or in any old-fashioned baker's recipe box!

This is by far the moistest, most delicious homemade yellow cake I've ever baked, and I bake a lot.  I took a suggestion from other reviewers and used 4 yolks and 2 whole eggs.  I've baked it in all forms: cupcakes(1/2 full about 15 min), 2 9\" rounds (20-21 min), 9x13 (30 min) and it always comes out amazingly.  For those people having problems with your cake sinking--check your baking powder and make sure it is fresh.  Old/stale baking powder is the prime cause of cakes sinking.

If you eat a piece of it while it's still slightly warm it will taste eggy.  After it's cooled off the eggy taste goes away. If the cake comes out dry it means you're baking it too long.  Watch for the cake to rise up in the middle and then deflate slightly.  It's at this point you should to see if the cake is done.  If a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out with wet batter then give cake about 5 more minutes and check it again.  If the toothpick comes out with gummy batter on it then give it about 3 more minutes.  If it comes out with a few crumbs sticking to it then it's done.  If it comes out perfectly clean then it's definitely done and may in fact be overdone.  I'd also like to add that if you're going to change any of the ingredients in this recipe then you shouldn't expect it to come out right.  Changing the ingredients and then giving a poor review is unfair to the person who submitted the recipe.",
