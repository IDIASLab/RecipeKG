I am going to submitt the recipe today.  It is for those of you that like a LESS SWEET version.  This version is REALLY SIMPLE, and every time I make it, everyone says it is the very best that they have ever eaten.  Pecan Pies today seem to be all corn surypy, so all you can taste is sweet.  My recipe is sweet, but buttery, almost caremelly. Here's the basic ingredients list.  \r\n1 stick melted butter\r\n1 c. sugar\r\n1 c. butter flavored pancake syrup\r\n1/4 tsp of salt\r\n1 tsp vanilla extract\r\n3 eggs\r\n1 prepared pie crust(deep dish style crust or you might have a little too much filling.)\r\n1 c. Pecans or Enough Pecans to cover the bottom of your pie shell.\r\n\r\nYou beat the 3 eggs well in a medium/large bowl, mix in the salt, sugar, and pancake syrup. Mix well, then slowly add the melted butter a little at a time to the egg mixture. Finally add the vanilla.\r\nArrange the pecans in the bottom of your pie shell and then pour the syrup misture over the top of it.  Put it into the preheated oven and bake like other recipes say.  I promise this is the best pecan pie you'll ever eat!!\r\n",

One thing that should be in the instructions is that the water and corn starch are mixed together before adding to the sugar mixture.

I have learned a few tricks of the trade, though.  1) Don't over beat your eggs, or it will have something of a merengue effect (and be puffy when you take it out of the oven).  Do what the recipe said - just until frothy.  2) Go for two cups of pecans, and I personally add a mix of whole and half nuts.  3) In attempt to reduce sugar/calories (even if only slightly), replace the corn syrup with a sugar-free / regular maple syrup mix.  4) A tablespoon of cinnamon goes a long way. :)",

Our older son (38) was in for a visit, so I took a chance on this pie just for him since he loves pecan pie.  After his first bite he said \"I could eat that entire pie!\"  He loved it. My two concerns are that it is messy to make, and it took me longer than 10 minutes to prepare it--not  complaining but mentioning that for planning purposes.  When I was bringing the ingredients to a boil while stirring constantly, the sugar started sticking to the side of the pot, and I thought I was going to have a hot mess, but I persevered and I'm glad I did.  Today I used a different recipe as a test (comparison recipe uses white sugar and pancake syrup) and, while it was quick and easy, it was a totally different pie--no comparison.  The test pie tasted more like an old-fashioned chess pie with pecans added.  I will definitely throw out any other pecan pie recipes and replace with this one.  This pecan pie recipe will be the one that becomes a family tradition.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Linda!",
