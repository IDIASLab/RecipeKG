This would be great as a change up from thanksgiving pies or just when you want something warm and familiar for the fall season. I would also recommend this to go along with be a thanksgiving or fall breakfast. Will be making this again.",

This recipe is delicious and better than what I remember the other to be!!!! Easy-peasy to prepare - the hardest part is simmering the milk and cornmeal until thickened only because it takes so long. What a Thanksgiving dessert! Hot or cold with or without a bit of cream or ice cream on on top. I use the ginger & cinnamon as called for then put about 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in as well. (The pie spice contains cinnamon and ginger plus allspice and a couple of other things.) It's fabulous! I start sampling it for \"doneness\" right out of the oven...",
