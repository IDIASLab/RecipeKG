Original: This deserves more than 5 stars!  I made this for Memorial Day BBQ and it was wonderful!  Used Maker's Mark and didn't change the recipe other than adding a bit more hot sauce.  Cooked it outside on the grill on Saturday for Monday's BBQ.  I strained the onions out and I wish I would have followed some other suggestions of cutting the onions into wedges to make it easier, but it all worked out in the end.  Letting the chicken soak in the BBQ sauce for 24 hours from yesterday until today made it even better!",

Thanks for sharing. I pre-baked the babybacks for 2 hours on 250, then slathered your sauce on them, put them under a low broiler. Then every 15 minutes, brushed them with the sauce again. At the end of 45 minutes the sauce had mostly carmelized and the meat was falling off the bones. Delicious! Thanks for sharing, Kevin.",

I've used high-end bourbon and cheap bourbon, and it seems like something mid-grade like Jim Beam works best. I always make huge batches of it to jar up and give out as gifts around the holidays. I live in Texas so BBQ sauce is appreciated any time of the year. You can do 6X the recipe (96 servings) in an 8-quart pot and it'll take about an hour to cook and reduce/thicken a bit. Yields 9 pint size jars of sauce - hot water bath for 25 minutes.",
