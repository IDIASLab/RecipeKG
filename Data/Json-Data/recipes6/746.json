This is really an interesting flavor certainly not barbeque but slightly reminiscent of it. I did thicken with a cornstarch slurry to give a little more body to the sauce. The meat was tender and flavorful. We ate it on pasta and also on rice. We also used it in a sandwich with cole slaw. It's a much more subtle flavor than barbeque and is definitely a nice change of pace.",
