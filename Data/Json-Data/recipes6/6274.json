        "description": "Chicken a la crema is one of my favorite recipes and one of the greatest chicken recipes of all time. It's simple to make, incredibly comforting, and gorgeous to look at. Sauteed mushrooms and onions are well browed to add extra flavor and give the sauce a beautifully rich color. Spoon this into a bowl alongside rice and top with a dollop of creme fraiche and a sprinkle of cilantro, or wrap it up in a fresh, warm tortilla and dunk it in the sauce--no matter how you serve it, this dish should be on every chicken lover's bucket list.",

I braised the pork shoulder in the cooking liquid for 3 hours, then added the cream and poblano peppers during the final 20-30 min of the cook (so that the peppers wouldn't be boiled into oblivion).  I can't really speak to the chicken version of this recipe, but it worked really, really well with the pork shoulder; some of the best pork I've ever had!  Flavors are spectacular, and it went really well with the Spanish rice I made.  I imagine it would be great on pasta or mashed potatoes, too.",
