Then they turned a nice golden brown while they were baking. The taste reminds me of a really good sweet bread. This is a very unique cookie and I'm glad I tried it!",

This coats the flour and keeps it from soaking up as much wine and becoming gluey.  Doing this, along with letting the dough cool awhile in the refrigerator before forming the cookies, means no sticky dough.  In fact the dough turns out elastic and just like playdough--very easy to handle.\n \nTo get the 2\" diameter cookies, pull off just enough to make balls a little under an inch in diameter.  They will be the right size when you flatten them.  Be generous with the sugar coating.  These go great with a cup of black tea.",

I love how cute they are too. I'm not sure I did it correctly since the other photos don't look like mine but I rolled the dough then rolled into little pinwheel shapes. I baked for 20 min not 25 which was perfect for my oven. They turn out very cute very small and very delicious. I have to agree with another reviewer who said that rolling in the sugar is important--gives just the right amount of sweetness. I also like the hint of wine flavor. All in all a nice little cookie that's perfect with tea. A great way to use up the rest of my red wine! Thanks!",

I was skeptical of the recipe since it called for so few ingredients (plus it seemed like a lot of liquid for the amount of flour) but it came out great. I made 2/3 of a recipe. I wasn't sure what shape to make the cookies (a ring?) so I made a pinwheel like another reviewer did. I rolled the entire cookie in sugar including the bottom which I don't recommend doing. Definitely roll it in sugar since it gives it the perfect amount of sweetness but rolling the bottom in sugar makes it burn to the pan. The cookies don't spread at all. I made them pretty thick about 1\" so the inside was soft while the outside was crisp. I liked them this way but next time I will make them 1/2\" thick as I wasn't 100% sure the inside was cooked all the way.",

The dough is pretty soft to work with and when rolling into a log shape they didn't hold the shape very well. And after they cooked I thought the little pinwheels were very unappetizing. Towards the end I just formed balls and smashed them flat then dreged them in sugar. As for flavor they remind me of a little biscuit more than a cookie.
