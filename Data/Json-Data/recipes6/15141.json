                "reviewBody": "Sea Foam is a challenging candy to make with absolutely wonderful results if done correctly. It helps to have a second person around to assist at a couple of points. Step One is to prepare for dropping the candy because it will harden quickly once it starts to cool. I place two long sections of wax paper on the table with a tablespoon on each sheet and I try to get a second person to help with the dropping. Step Two is making sure you cook the sugar mix to a hard ball stage. Short of the hard ball and your candy will not set; overcook and the sugar mixture crystallizes. Step Three is to whip the egg whites to a firm foam while the sugar mix is cooking. Continue whipping with your mixer while pouring a think stream of the sugar mix into the foam. Whip until the mix begins to cool and makes a peak when you lift the mixer. Step Four is to immediately and quickly drop the candy onto the prepared wax paper. You only have a couple of minutes to get it all out. Scope from the sides of the bowl because it will cool quicker there. \"Hit\" the spoon slightly on the paper to deposit the candy and move on to the next spoon.",
