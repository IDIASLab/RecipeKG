I started out the alterations with 1/2 c finely chopped onion in about 3 tbsp butter in the bottom of the stock pot and proceeded to add whatever was open and needed to be used in the kitchen. I substituted chicken stock for water used about 12 small yukon gold potatoes and added kidney beans lots of black pepper 1/2 tsp of chili powder and about 1/2 c of red wine from the bottom of the bottle - all of which combined with the recipe to make a nicely-flavored soup. The soup is quite hearty filling and was even better on day two as lunch. I was pleasantly surprised with the results and recommend this recipe as a guideline that can be liberally altered to your own tastes. I may even try some chicken next time.",
