I don't like canned mandarins so I left those out as well as the almonds just to cut back on the fat. I cut the dressing amount probably in half eyeballing most ingredients so it was dressed lightly. I think it would have been too oily if I had used the whole cup of oil. The banana worked surprisingly well in this salad. I will make it again perhaps splurging on the almonds.",
