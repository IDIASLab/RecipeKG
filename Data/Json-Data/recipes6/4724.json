This is what I came up with using a few other recipes as guidelines. I think it's even better than what I was trying to mimic. Any combination of squash, sweet potato, potato, carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabaga, pumpkin etc. will do. I can recommend highly a combination of sweet potato, mini red potatoes, parsnips, and carrots.",

It was delicious!! (might add some green peas next time!)",

I made a few modifications, must notably the addition of golden raisins. This was one of my favorite parts in the restaurant version and it turned out beautifully at home. The raisins balance the curry spice and add another flavor and texture dimension to all the root veggies.  Trust me, it is so good. Since I really like them I added about 3/4 cup. Other modifications included that I doubled the curry powder, used skim milk, chicken broth, and only about two tablespoons of butter.",
