I intend to serve this as an after school snack!  I really enjoyed this recipe, once I made the following adjustments:\n\nI had to add a BIT more water (gradually) so that I could work with the dough.  The recipe didn't specify to do so, but I did chill the  dough prior to baking, with good results.  Also, I added the \"three sisters,\" cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, to the sugar I put on the dough.  I also doubled this recipe, and it was BARELY enough, everyone liked it so well!  I followed the directions for rolling out and frying, but after about four of them, mine were too doughy, and I personally don't like oil, so I took the rest of the flattened balls (I rolled all of them and the flattened them all at once), laid them out and cut them into strips with a pizza cutter and baked at 345 until golden!  Served with honey butter, and both blackberry and strawberry preserves  (and vanilla ice cream), these went faster than I could bake them!  The next time I make this recipe, I'm going to try baking small rounds of it over inverted ramikens to make little edible dessert bowls.  This is a keeper!",
