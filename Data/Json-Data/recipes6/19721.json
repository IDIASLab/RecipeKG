For taffy success it is important to know that the taffy is ready when it reaches 275F AND turns a brownish color. If your taffy comes out too soft then you didn't heat it enough. Also the taffy is ready to pull when you try to pull it away from the side of the pan and it takes on a \"gelatin\" consistency: solid but elastic. Make sure you DO NOT butter your hands with this taffy - if you do it will fall apart!",

Not to mention that the flavor was lacking also. I tasted more butter, vanilla and salt than I could the actual flavoring of the batch.  FYI-pouring it into a greased baking dish is a BIG mistake and makes for an extremely tough time trying to peel it out.  I suggest lining the baking dish with thick wax paper before pouring the mixture into it.  Overall, I won't be making this again.",
