I did not use the oil to cook the pancakes in because I used my nonstick tabletop griddle. These pancakes cooked up flat but the flavor was fantastic. I served them with a homemade maple-vanilla pancake syrup. Both kids asked me to make these again tomorrow--they ate every single one of these. I think these would be just right with a touch more baking soda. NOTE: I got SIX medium sized pancakes from one recipe.",

I don't like overly sweet pancakes since syrup goes on top anyway so I cut the brown sugar in half; that was perfect. I upped the baking powder to 3/4 tsp; they were not flat at all. I used one whole egg instead of two whites. My only issue was that they did have a tendency to brown quickly and looked like they would burn. I cooked them on med low heat. Even the ones that looked overcooked tasted great. I'd really like to make these again!",

I did add vanilla and doubled the baking powder and soda as had been suggested by other reviews. I did not have any trouble with them over browning as some people had. I have never liked pancakes as just too bland, but these were light and cake like and great flavor. I think I'll add an extra banana next time, though.",
