I made the full amount of sauce (used the suggested Mirin instead of sherry)  - but only 2 thighs and 3 small boneless skinless breasts. I used about a 1/3 of the marinade for the chicken - the rest I heated on the stovetop and reduced a bit - used some of that to paint the chicken with while cooking. I did do these on the grill instead of the broiler of the oven. Served with coleslaw, rice and steamed broccoli. The extra sauce was perfect drizzled over the rice and broccoli.  Hubby said - \"10 stars - next time double the garlic and I would give it 20 stars!\"  He dislikes broccoli but even ate the steamed broccoli with this sauce.  Keeper!  Thanks so much for a great recipe, Mama Smith!",

Researching Huli Huli a little it is supposed to be grilled not baked. However I will say that high temp oven cooking (if there had been skin on these)would have crisped the skin as the outside of the breasts did become a little hardened. Not bad hard just not soft like a normal baked chicken. The marinade basting didn't seem to have any effect until I thickened it with some cornstarch then basted. That did the trick stayed on nicely and gave a nice finish on them. While I found the soy a little overpowering for me the guys enjoyed them immensely and the sauce I held out and thickened for gravy went over fine on the mashed potatoes I made to go with it. I would like to try this again on the grill when it gets to come out from the winter. Thanks for the recipe!",

Totally worth the wait. I made some minor changes but nothing too out there. First of all I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings but only used 6 chicken breasts. I didn't have sherry so I used extra pineapple juice instead. When it came to cook time I preheated the oven at 425 F but instead of putting it in the broiler right away I put it in the oven. Let it cook 10 minutes flipped it basted it with the marinade and let it cook another 10 minutes. During that 10 minutes I thicken the rest of the marinade with 1 tbsp of cornstarch on the stove-top. Then I flipped the chicken basted it with the thickened sauce moved the pan to the broiler and cooked for another 10 minutes. Finally I flipped it again basted it and broiled for another 5 minutes to get nice char on top. Once out I basted it a final time and let it rest for about 5 minutes and then sliced. My family absolutely loved it. Usually they hate when I make back to back chicken recipes but there wasn't one grumble or complaint. I will definitely make this again.",

When grilling I continue to baste and turn the chicken almost every 4 minutes so the meat stays really moist. This recipe is quick and easy to prepare and is always a big hit. The fresh ginger and garlic really add to the flavor. As an alternative recipe I've also sliced the chicken after preparation and put into toasted tortilla shells with melted sharp cheddar fresh cilantro avocado and pico de gallo.
