Grandmom used to say vanilla is the key to any recipe and she was so correct! I also added 1 more apple to it. It was very moist and so delicious.",

In response to some of the other reviews, I would like to point out that because the denseness and dryness of the bread used can vary so much, the quantity of milk for the recipe has to be adjusted.  For example, I used dry crispy crust french bread, so I added 2 extra cups of milk to the recipe, letting the bread/milk mixture soak for a half hour before baking.  The end result was great.",
