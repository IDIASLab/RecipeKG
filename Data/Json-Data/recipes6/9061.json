One large brown (yellow) onion and three cloves garlic, finely chopped and caramelised in butter for 5 mins,  put in slow cooker with thyme, salt, pepper, two bay leaves, splash white wine, and enough beef stock to just cover the chops when mixed with a packet of dry Maggi French onion soup. (I used two chops).  follow the recipe but remember the chops fall apart after 8h on low. Ladle them out  at the end or cook less  to remain intact and chop shaped. I paired this with mashed potato with steamed carrots, peas and cauliflower. Liberally splosh the gravy over and enjoy!",

My chops had crumbled and fallen completely off the bone, and I pulled my after 6 hours on low. I would recommend 3 things: a 4 hour cook time, BONELESS chops (ours cooked down so much that there were bone shards that were difficult to spoon out), and more seasoning on the chops themselves/in the gravy. I really think the gravy could have benefitted from some pepper. We served everything over egg noodles and it tasted awesome!",
