They don't cook in the middle leaving a creamy center which is still good but not how they are supposed to be. Also make sure as with all oil frying that your oil it hot hot hot! That way they won't be greasy. These were so tasty not heavy or greasy at all and my picky husband who rarely tries anything new even liked them! Thanks for this great recipe!",

I'm not a big nutmeg fan so I substituted cinnamon and ginger. I recommend trying to not make the fritters too large which can result in the middle not being done. To go with the fritters I made an apple sauce out of shredded apples dried cranberries lemon juice cinnamon ginger butter water and a dash or two of salt. I heated on the stove (slightly above medium) until it became somewhat thick (around 15 minutes total). Try cutting the cheese fritters in half and placing the apple sauce on it. Yummy!",
