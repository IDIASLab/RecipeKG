My tips to add: I used self raising flour and I did not crush the flakes which makes the cookie taste more crunchy and you can actually see the flakes. I followed your method and it turned out just great. Thank you so much for this! Unlike the other reviews it did not turn out hard at all. The tips say that the cookies dont expand which is quite true so just press them down lightly if you want a bigger cookie. I also added 1 tspn of vanilla essence - a very good idea. Also baking time should be 15 minutes exactly at 175 deg celcius.",
