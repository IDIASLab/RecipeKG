Filling falling out and not a good presentation.  It would a good addition to greens to be eaten with utensils.  I am going to experiment with limiting the liquids, primarily the olive oil, and adding some cream cheese for form.  Also needs some color like red or orange pepper.   In the future I will stick with recipes with reviews as I have had very good luck with AR, even for guests.",
