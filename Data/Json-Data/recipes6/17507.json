I did make sure to use a cloth-type pastry bag and it worked great.  I had to pinch each one off into the oil as they didn't just break off, which was totally fine.  They did cook pretty fast, so I was getting behind on coating them with the cinnamon/sugar. So, I figured out a quick (and much easier) way to do it. I would scoop them out of the oil with a large flat slotted spoon onto paper towels just long enough to put the next batch into the skillet.  I would then dump the hot churros into a ziploc bag with the cinnamon and sugar, shake it up and then just took them out with my hands and placed them on the serving plate. That worked great and they were perfectly coated.",

I had to call into my boyfriend to help me remove the oil and coat them, there was no time for one person!  Also, they looked kinda like big pieces of poo. Mind you they tasted delicious so who cares how they look?",
