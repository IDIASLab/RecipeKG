I made it one day when I had 3 back-up desserts and it was one of the first to go. So easy to make and a popular demand by my family, I make it all the time.  Hey!!  Even my no-impress mother-in-law asked for the recipe!!!  Enjoy!",

Yes, like everyone else says, it is much more like a cheese danish than a true cheesecake.  No matter what you call it though, it was really delicious and super easy!  I definitely would use reduced fat crescent rolls and reduced fat cream cheese for this next time- I don't think you'd ever notice a difference in flavor with all the butter, sugar and cinnamon in this.  I also would use less butter on the top.  I only used about 1/3 cup and I thought that was a even more than necessary.  For presentation, I topped mine with chopped pecans for the last 10 minutes of baking time.  It looked nice, but would have tasted great without them too.  Thanks for a recipe that's definitely a keeper!",

No one disliked it, but no one was \"raving\" either, and I thought it tasted more like a sweet, breakfast danish than a dessert cheesecake.  Also, it didn't end up with much visual appeal either, which might not matter to some, but I like my food pretty.  I followed the directions exactly, served after chilling in the fridge.  It tastes good, but a little blah... I do like the idea of adding a pie filling.  If I try again, I'll add a layer of pie filling, reduce the sugar, cut the butter in half, and serve with coffee for breakfast.  ",
