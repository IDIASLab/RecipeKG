I think the key to the flavour not being lost is to slice the tenderlion into 1 inch medallions before putting it in the marinade.  I only used 1/2 the recipe and there was plenty of marinade to coat all the meat in a large bag.  If you slice your pork (or chicken would be great to)o, I would only marinade for 3-5 hours since the lime and orange slightly cooks the meat.  Cook the medallions on medium heat 3-4 minutes per side or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F and let it rest for 5 minutes to reach a final 160 degrees F.  I did a rough chop of the meat and served in corn tortillas for a mexican dinner.",
