For the yellow cake mix I substituted  1 1/2 cups flour+ 3tsp. baking powder+ 4tbs corn starch+ 1 1/3 cups sugar+ 2tsp vanilla as suggested by a user on a similar recipe.

I had everything on hand to make half of this recipe and it actually allowed me to use up half a cake mix and half a box of pudding mix that were leftover in the pantry. I could see no reason why this called for that tiny bit of butter so I left it out. I did however add 2 T. of melted butter to the brown sugar/walnut mixture to moisten it up and I used half in the middle of the cake and half on top. I used a 9 springform pan and baked this for 32 minutes. I made Vanilla Glaze from this site to drizzle over the top which worked out well. Hubs came home proclaiming the fishing guys loved this so five stars it is. The only changes I would make next time if making half he recipe would be to make half again as much walnut/brown sugar mixture and I'd use an 8 inch pan to give this a little more height.",
