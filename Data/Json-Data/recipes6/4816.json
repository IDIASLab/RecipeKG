Second time, I made a few adjustments based on our own tastes and the ingredients I had on hand:  Used chicken stock instead of vegetable,  sauteed about 1/2 lb of mushrooms, two fresh jalapenos, and 1 cup sweet onions in the butter, added 1 tsp. garam masala along with the curry powder, used crushed tomatoes instead of fresh, and added chopped fresh spinach when adding the tortellini.  This soup can take many adjustments, based on your own stash, but it is terrific just as written.  We'll enjoy this one often.",

I also added extra tortellini a whole pint of mushrooms and a 1/2 tsp of cayenne. With the extra tortellini it could use more broth so I'll add more vegetable stock next time. Can't wait to make this again. Great recipe!",

Variations I did: - Used Earth Balance Soy Free Margarine in place of butter - Added 1 package of sliced mushrooms at the stage with the shallots - Added 2 TBSP of curry powder instead of 1 - Added less than a TSP of cayenne powder along with curry powder - Added 1 TBSP of flour to help thicken the soup (added this at time of adding curry powder and cayenne powder - just make sure to stir well to get it all mixed with the shallots and mushrooms) - Added 1 package of baby kale to pot after coconut milk was added - Added canned tomatoes instead of fresh (after baby kale had wilted down) Delicious hearty and will be making this regularly!

I make a curry stew that's similar to this so I decided to leave the coconut milk & tomatoes out due to the similarity of the stew recipe I use. I'm not a fan of spicy so I left out hte jalapeno pepper slices out. I added mushrooms since I had them on hand. I realize this ended up being a different style dish but I was looking for inspiration for a curry dumpling soup I had recently and the coconut milk would have changed the whole thing for me. This was so delicious. Thank you for sharing!",

I ended up putting in an extra tablespoon of curry powder and garam masala seasoning. After adding the tortellini I added shredded coconut and a dash of shredded Asiago after serving.
