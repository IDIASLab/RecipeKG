I usually mix the dough up one day wrap it and then bake it in the next few days when I have time. This is the same recipe in the Taste of Home \"Best of Country Cookies\" cookbook a cookbook I will never part with ever. You can vary the intensity of the coffee flavor by choosing either a dark or light roast instant coffee. I just made these for a cookie exchange and I used two packets from a box of Folgers Fresh Breaks Black Silk (dark) single serve packets. The coffee flavor really comes through and will be made even better with a thin coat of chocolate. If you like a nice mocha give this one a try!",

Make sure to slice them a generous 1/4\" thickness and bake them only until the edges have a slight firmness when touched. They will then cool to a light softness. Secondly if making lots of cookies you'll want to occasionally rewarm the dipping chocolate. This keeps the dipped coating from getting too thick and ovewhelming. I sometimes also dip just an edge in the chocolate rather than half the cookie. This makes just a tease of milk chocolate. Lastly I put the dipped cookies on wax paper and chill them for a bit before storing them. This keeps the dip from sticking when stacking cookies.",
