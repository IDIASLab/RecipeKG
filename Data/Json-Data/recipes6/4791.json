I only had ground Oregano so I only used about a teaspoon maybe a tad more but a whole tablespoon would have been way too much...otherwise I made it exactly as written. Oh except my local Kroger didn't have Cremini mushrooms so I just used extra buttons. The flavor is very good both my husband and I couldn't believe there was no meat. Next time I will make a full batch and freeze them for lunches. This recipe is a keeper! Oh beware these were a tad too spicy for my husband so if you have a wimpy palette go easy on the crushed red pepper (half it don't omit it)...and use fresh basil it really makes the flavors pop.",

I used brown rice and quartered the recipe since there are two of us. To speed up baking time I boil my peppers before stuffing them. Because they were already cooked rather than a soup base in the tray I surrounded the peppers with the extra stuffing. Great Flavours love the balsamic flavour in the mushrooms and kudos for not being afraid of garlic. We love garlic!",

Results were just okay and for as long as it took to make them it simply wasn't worth it. I definitely didn't think they were as good as the reviews suggested and my family didn't like them either. Kids ended up having it for dinner the next night. They aren't picky eaters and they were not amused and frankly I didn't blame them. I made them just as directed.",
