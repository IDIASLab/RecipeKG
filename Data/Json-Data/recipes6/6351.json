I made this a second time playing with the ingredients a little. I used regular chicken breasts and cut them into small pieces. Instead of using olive oil i used cooking spray and only 1 tbsp. butter. I then reduced the amount of cumin and chili powder so that it would not overpower the buffalo taste. Tasted more like what i was expecting from the title. If it is still a little too spicy add a little bit of ranch to cool it down.",
