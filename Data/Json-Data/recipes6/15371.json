However, as a native Jock here in the US, the best tip to make these biscuits even more endulgent and melt on the tongue - substitute one cup of flour for one cup of birds custard powder. You will get a richer golden colour, deeper crumble and crunch in the texture, and a toasted baked note to finish. My Gran's traditional recipe from Glasgow. try it and you won't be dissapointed!",
