I didn't think there was enough batter for a 9x13 pan, so I used a 7x11 pan and baked for about 50 mins.....in the end I think a 9x13 would've been ok.   I also did not use the full 1/4 cup rum at the end, I was taking this to work so I only used about 1/8 cup on top, and then sprinkled it with powdered sugar before serving.

I frosted it with the Quick Penuche Frosting recipe in the New Joy of Cooking using the rum option in that recipe. Everyone loved it. I think that combination of cake and frosting would make a nice layer cake for the birthday of someone who likes those flavors. I might however be tempted to experiment with this recipe by cutting the applesauce by 1/2 cup and adding 2 eggs and a bit of baking powder to make the cake rise a bit more.",
