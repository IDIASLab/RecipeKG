I followed the suggestion of reducing the water and broth by half to make it more creamy and stew-like rather than like a soup. I did make some changes: used two tbls. of Madras curry powder and two tbls. of Thai red curry paste instead of the 4 tbls. of curry powder. Didn't add the red pepper flakes and substituted reduced sodium soy sauce for the fish sauce. Added one large sweet potato instead of the 8 regular potatoes and used lite coconut milk...still creamy and delicious! I let it simmer for about 1.5 - 2 hours and the house smelled so good! The directions didn't specify when to add the kaffir lime leaves and bay leaf so I threw them in right before I started the \"simmer\" process.",

I reduced the amount of curry and chili for the children's sakes and it was just right. The only thing is that the cooking times on the recipe don't do it justice! AllRecipes puts this soup as being ready in two hours but that's way way off. Mine was done in under 40 minutes and that included frying my own tofu! A very quick and easy recipe.",

I used green onions instead of Shallots (one whole bunch) I alos used lime zest and juice instead of the kaffir lime leaves and I used lemon juice instead of the lemon grass. I also used soy sauce instead of the fish sauce. The soy sause really gave it a distinct flavor. I didn't fry my tofu and it still tasted great. I used one reviewers suggestion and used sweet potato intead of regular patatos and it tasted great. The bean sprouts and cilantro added on top was wonderful it added a new texture and taste. Great recipe I will definatly keep this in the recipe box and make again.",
