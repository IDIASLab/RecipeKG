Let it sit for an hour or two before you eat it to let the salt and cumin get absorbed into the ingredients. I was a little skeptical about the combination of hominy and black beans because my family can be really picky but they loved it. Serve it with some chips and enjoy!!! I used Pace MEDIUM hot sauce but I think next time I will use the HOT sauce to give it a little extra bite. My kids liked it like I made it this time it was pretty mild.",
