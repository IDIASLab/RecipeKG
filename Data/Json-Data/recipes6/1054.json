Out of desperation, I added about 2 table spoons of Worcester Sauce  because ketchup brisket did not taste pleasant. That was it! Just add a bit of Worcester to taste and this is amazing! There's a ton of sauce left over from the brisket and it's really good with shredded chicken too.",

I have never liked sweet and sour dishes though which this reminded me of. I could taste the vinegar and sugar over anything else. I would make this again but i would tweek it somehow. I also used flour to thicken the sauce and make it like a gravy and ate it over mashed potaoes the potatoes seemed to even out the taste for me. I started on the stove top and finished it in the oven 225 for 4 hours. Meat was tender.",
