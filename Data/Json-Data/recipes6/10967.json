I used egg substitute soy milk and gluten free flour mix. I used brown sugar for white and cut up a small apple fine dice to add to the cake. We also love cinnamon so put 1/2 tsp and 1/4 tsp ginger and cloves in it. I put the sliced apples and cinnamon/sugar mix on top artfully and baked for all of 50 minutes. Make this for your gluten free friends it works great. Served with rice ice-cream and didn't miss a thing. Yummmm..........Thankyou Carol for sharing.",
