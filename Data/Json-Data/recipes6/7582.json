I did not add the sage, I used 1/2 shredded cheese and 1/2 velveeta, and cut the hot dogs into 1/4 inch rings which made the hot dogs go farther.  I also halved the recipe and it made a 9x9 inch pan.  In a previous post there was a question as to why the celery.  Mystery solved!  After my second bite of this casserole, the light bulb went on and if I had added the sage, this product would have been more of a corn bread dressing with hot dogs.  Glad I left the sage out.  My husband and I like this casserole anyway and had second helpings.",

Still I'm not a huge fan of frying so I prefer enjoying my corn dogs differently. I've made some corn dog muffins on here that we enjoy but was looking for something new. I made some adjustments based on what I had on hand and on the review by G. I don't have celery or green onions so I just left it out and I also left out the butter. I used two packages of little smokies and added onion powder and 1/2 c of plain greek yogurt to the mix along with the milk and eggs. I also used the recipe for Corn Bread Mix on here for the corn bread. I wasn't sure how much to use so I might have used too much (I made 12 servings of the corn bread mix recipe and used all of it). I used a 9x13 casserole pan. It turned out wonderfully within 35 minutes. This does taste like corn dogs to me--there's a bit of a change maybe more breading that corn breads have and perhaps not as sweet but for an easy casserole that eliminates frying the corn dogs it works just great for me. Thanks for the recipe!",
