I decided to add a 1/4 cup of white sugar (which seemed to make it tastier) I also did not have unsalted butter so I used the salted butter that I had- and omitted the salt from the ingredients. However I would tell anyone using this recipe to watch the bake time because mine were done in 9-10 minutes. Any longer they would have burned. So overall they were okay My husband also agreed with a previous poster in saying that the cookies were \"missing something\". A little disappointed.....",
