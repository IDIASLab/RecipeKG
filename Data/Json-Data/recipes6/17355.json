                "reviewBody": "I have mixed feelings on this one and as this recipe's first reviewer I want to be as accurate as possible.  The shortening and buttermilk each contribute to ensure a moist cake, so no problem there, but of course you don\u2019t get the rich flavor of butter \u2013 I might go half and half if I were to make this again.  The chocolate flavor was mild, more for looks than chocolaty taste. A 5.5 oz. can of chocolate syrup is not something I would typically have on hand \u2013 I simply measured it into a liquid measuring cup from the large Hershey\u2019s squirt bottle. The ingredients and measurements are fairly standard, so I knew I\u2019d come out with a decent cake.  It\u2019s basically the execution and technique I had some issues with.  First, you aren\u2019t going to \u201cfold\u201d the two batters, you\u2019re going to sort of swirl them with a skewer, a knife or, as I used, a chopstick.  I\u2019ve never been very good at marbling but it was nearly impossible when you have equal amounts of both batters. In other words, it would have been better to have considerably less chocolate batter, drop it by spoonfuls onto the white batter and then swirl it.   Also, this cake should be baked at 325 degrees, not 350.  The baking time will be longer, but you\u2019ll end up with a more evenly baked cake.  This is a pound cake, after all, which is heavy and dense.  At the higher temperature of 350, the cake was done on the outside long before it was done on the inside.  I found this an acceptable cake, but not notable enough to make again.",
