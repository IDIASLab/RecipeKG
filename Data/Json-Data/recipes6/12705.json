When you are dropping them on the baking sheet, their will be a pointy tip on each cookie that will still be there once they are baked. Just take the bottom of a clean spoon and gently  press on the top of each cookie as soon as they come out of the oven. This will give the icing more of a surface to lay on.",

I might just like these MORE than pupkin bread! They are similar to little cakes. Just AMAZINGly moist. The only diff. was I also added about 1/2 tsp. allspice. I always bake on silicone treated baker's parchment paper. Turned out AMAZING! I got my icing to look like the picture by adding about 1 c. more powdered sugar.. and make the frosting first. It really needs to cool. I turned over my cookies and dipped the tops in the icing.. Trying to drizzle over the cookies was way too messy!",

Very mild flavor, my teenager devoured these like there was no tommorrow, but I thought they could use a little more spice. A 15 oz can of pumpkin is 2 cups. For the icing I used dark brown sugar and cooked it until it looked like it was all dissolved (or melted). I added about 4 cups of powdered sugar and the glaze/frosting worked great (and I had plenty left). The cookies were good plain, but the icing really makes them so don't leave it off. This makes a LOT of cookies. I got 7 dozen. These stayed soft, moist, and cakelike for the several days they lasted here. Thanks for sharing this terrific cookie recipe.",

These cookies baked for about 15 minutes in my oven instead of 10 and I split the recipe in half twice which baked about 15 cookies. These cookies are very soft and cake-like but they are irresistable. I also added some chocolate chips to half the batter and the chocolate chips overwhelmed the taste of pumpkin. These cookies are a hit. Everyone LOVES the frosting.",
