First of all I think the temperature of 500 degrees is too high (or maybe it's my oven?) but they turned out way too crisp and mostly burnt. I did the 15 minute intervals too. I added the low sodium vegetable stock at the end and I think with the whole teaspoon of salt in the beginning even the low sodium stock was too much. They were very salty. I ate the ones that weren't burnt and threw the rest away. I probably won't be making these again (which looked so good in the picture)!",
