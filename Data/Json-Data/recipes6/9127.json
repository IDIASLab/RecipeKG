Mine were on the small-medium side, so I did 30 minutes total. I roasted the breasts initially for 10 minutes, then added the sauce and continued cooking for another 20. I didn't find any reason to add the sauce on twice. This will only be as good as the sauce you use, so use one you love! I used my homemade maple whiskey BBQ sauce. Next time I would grill the chicken, but this turned out pretty good for the oven.",

These very simple common sense meals that we sometimes forget about are great for every day dinners.  Save the 30-step, 50 ingredient recipes for special occasions.
