I've made lentil soup in all kinds of variations, but this will be promoted to \"go-to\" status from now on.\n\nWhite wine is everything is this recipe! While I omitted arugula because husband is not a fan and used feta cheese because that's what I had, I doubt those small tweaks took anything away from the hearty and tasty qualities this soup possesses.\n\nServed with crisp hot garlic bread, any foodie will feast on this simple tummy-warming meal as the days and evenings grow cooler.",

The main difference was the 1 cup chardonnay (I simmered the veggies in it for about 5 mins before adding the broth, tomatoes, and water) and the paprika.  I also subbed 5 oz baby spinach for the arugula because I had it on hand.  I LOVED IT!!  A little heat from the paprika, and the broth was very rich.  I didn't even add the goat cheese...maybe tomorrow after it festers overnight.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I will make this again.",
