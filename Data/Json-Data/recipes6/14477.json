I don't think I'll ever go back to the old recipe after having this pie. It was wonderful. Everyone who tried it agreed it was the best pecan pie we've ever tried. I did have to increase the baking time to around 55 minutes. The recipe called for dark corn syrup but light works just as well. Also the directions call to add the \"whipped\" cream. This was a little confusing as it should (I believe) just be the heavy cream (NOT whipped). All-in-all it was heavenly and I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing it \"Peanut\"!",
