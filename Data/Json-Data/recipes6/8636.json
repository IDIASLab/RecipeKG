Making the advieh (looked online on how to) was easy, especially because I had dried rose petals hanging on my rose bushes in my yard (because I'm not very good at tending to them).  You probably have all the other ingredients in your spice rack.  These were easy to make and very tasty.  I couldn't get ground lamb (shortages with Covid19), so I used ground chicken thighs.  Still very delicious and good texture.  Secondly, pomegranate molasses is very easy to make (allrecipes.com has an easy recipe for it).  We will definitely make this again.",
