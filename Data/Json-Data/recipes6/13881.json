It's been something I've made for almost a year now & I always have a batch ready to use.  I use soy milk or lactaid because the expiration date for the milk tend to be a month away from the day I bought it which means the dressing lasts longer!  I take a lock-n-lock & double the ingredients for the dressing.  Mix everything but the poppy seeds (or sesame seeds) b/c they tend to just stick to the lid or bottom, so you never get the portion you want.  Instead I just sprinkle it over the actual salad (any works) when I'm ready to serve, and give my lock n lock a shake before pouring over the salad!  I prefer using Almond Accents found in salad section because they're already toasted, sliced, and have different flavors. Also sprinkle cranraisins or dried blueberries along with fresh strawberries.  Delish!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a very yummy salad! Two hearts of romaine and about half a 9oz. bag of spinach was just right for me. I think most of the yumminess is in the dressing - the salad itself is very simple (even simpler when I picked all the onions off my serving!). I followed reviewer suggestions to reduce the mayo to 1/3 c. and the poppy seeds to just 1 Tbsp then used a full 3 Tbsp. of red wine vinegar. Really tasty like that but I was serving this at a baby shower for twin girls so I wanted a pinker hue than the vinegar alone could give. I tossed in 3-4 frozen raspberries that I happened to have on hand and shook the you-know-what out of it until they just completely dissolved! Much pinker and even tastier. Added later: I just tried a little of the dressing drizzled over a bowl of leftovers from the fruit tray (cantaloupe honeydew red grapes & strawberries). An unusual but very yummy way to enjoy both! Even later: I made a quick version with just leftover spinach sliced strawberries and the dressing. I did not miss the romaine but even though I didn't actually eat the onions last time I missed the hint of flavor that they added. Don't skip them!",

I used red wine vinegar instead of white which gave the dressing a slight pinkish color and it still tasted fine. Next time I think I will reduce the mayo (maybe 1/3 cup?) and the poppy seeds (2 T. is WAY too much--maybe 1 T.?) and increase the vinegar (3 T.). Also I think this would taste great with toasted candied almond slivers. Thank you Mary for a delicious new way to use strawberries! I will definitely make this again--in fact I have some dressing left over!:-)",
