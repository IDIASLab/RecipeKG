This is best when you keep the slaw/green onion mixture, the sunflower seeds/almonds/ramen noodles mixture and the dressing separate until serving time (much better when it's crunchy, but it's still pretty good when the noodles and nuts get soggy).  It will stay somewhat crunchy for about 12 hours after mixing together.  SO good!",

I followed the directions precisely except for minor changes. Instead of using vegetable oil, chicken flavored noodles and peanuts,I used toasted sesame oil, oriental flavored ramen noodles and added sliced almonds.  The toasted sesame oil definately enhanced the flavor. And I did not cook the noodles prior to adding them to the salad. I enjoy cooking but I don't like spending all day chopping or being in the kitchen so this recipe was amazingly easy and my kind of \"cooking\"; a palate pleaser. I will definately make this dish again.",

Hee Hee. I went home rough chopped the crowns shredded the carrots and sliced the onion real thin. I found a small bag of roasted almonds in the cabinet Score! This salad is just the Best tasting sweet and tangy! I baked some chicken and I put that on the salad.

Only use one ramen package (oriental flavor) 1/8 cup sugar (actually splenda sugar/sweetner mix) mix natural rice vinegar with the cider vinegar.
