I m not the most experienced baker in the world but the problem is with the crust and I have to wonder if more butter is needed. I just knew when I was assembling this I was going to have a problem just too dry. To say they re crumbly is putting it mildly. The blueberry-strawberry layer is good but we had to eat the bars in a small bowl with a fork. I was hoping for something that would have been much firmer in consistency.",
