I changed it just a little bit by adding 1/4 cup of olive oil (I don't use the extra virgin because the taste is a bit strong but it also works). I also used half the cinnamon just because my husband is not crazy about it but in the end I could still taste the cinnamon at just the right level. Instead of folding the walnuts in I sprinkled them over the top for presentation purposes only and it came out lovely. I shared the cake with relatives and then had to turn over this recipe shortly after. Thanks for sharing it with us!!",

I knew the apples I was using would stay firm and not give off a lot of moiture so I added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt to the batter. It was moist but not soggy. The amount of sugar is perfect and the same for the cinnamon. I didn't have the specified size pan so I used a 10.5\" cast iron pan without any problem. I love the glossy deep golden color of this cake. It's old-fashioned in the best sense of the phrase. I wish I could tell you what it was like after being refrigerated but it disappeared while it was still war!",

Great place to start would be great with vanilla ice cream fresh out of the oven! Didn't need quite 45 min in the muffin tins about 40. I omitted the walnuts.",
