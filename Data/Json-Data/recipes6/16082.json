This makes a wonderfully flavorful sugar cookie similar to those found in restaurants and stores it is just not ideal for rolling and cutting out shapes it is better for just round molded cookies. The dough was very easy to work with and the flavor of these cookies is...for lack of a better word...wonderful! It is exactly the flavor I was looking for in a sugar cookie so I will most likely \"tweak\" this recipe and use it again many times!",

It looks crumbly after you mix it but I just gathered up the whole dough wrapped it in a piece of plastic wrap refrigerated it and then instead of rolling it out we just made 1 inch balls and pressed them into Christmas sprinkles. They spread a lot but they made a nice chewy sugar cookie. Very easy recipe. Will make these again and again.",
