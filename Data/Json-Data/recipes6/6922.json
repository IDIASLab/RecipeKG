It would have been nice, but I didn't have it on hand.  I added all the carrots and potatoes at the beginning before I put the dutch oven in the oven.  They were perfectly cooked, not overdone at all.  I think putting them in later would have left them underdone.  I adore venison, and this is definitely a recipe I saved!

I think using at least one sweet veggie, like peas or sweet potatoes, is a nice counterbalance to the slight tang of the wine sauce.  I made this with freshly harvested venison after we forgot to grind a small bit.  Rather than dirty the freshly cleaned grinder, I opted for this stew.  This recipe has convinced me to put up more venison stew meat in the future.  Thanks!",

I made a few small changes: I added some chopped celery with the onion, and I added a little sage and tarragon per another recipe on this site. It was also much easier for me to use all beef broth instead of using some beef, some chicken. I left out the mushrooms because I am the only person in my family who will eat them. They would have made a great recipe even better! \n\nI imagine this recipe could be adjusted some to thicken it further and be used as a filling for pot pie. \n\nI served this with cornbread and a salad. I will definitely make this again, and it will be my go-to when I have venison stew meat. Thanks for sharing!",
