Used a 1/2 C Splenda, added 1tsp Cinnamon and 1/2tsp Nutmeg.  For a topping I used 1/4C brown sugar, 1/8C butter and 2C Honey Bunches of Oats cereal (as suggested by another to use cornflakes, I used what I had on hand and loved the result).

First of all, I like to roast the squash rather than boiling it.  I just cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, and roast it at 375 for 45 min-1 hour.  It is easier to just scoop out the cooked sqaush than peel the skin off the little chunks.  This does take longer, but in my opinion, it is much easier.  I also add cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger which adds a nice flavor.  The last thing that I change is that instead of the suggested topping, I use chopped pecans.",

The skin peeled right off. I made the recipe \"as is\" with the exception of adding a little cinnamon, ginger, and oops, I had it out, but I forgot to add the brown sugar to the topping. Didn't matter though, Everyone raved over it! I read the reviews and I'm so glad I didn't cut back on the sugar. I don't think I would have liked it so much without the full amount of sugar. It's like a pumpkin type of dessert or a Thanksgiving side dish but I served it on a normal weeknight and it was excellent! I definitely suggest that you try the recipe before cutting back unless you need to watch your sugar intake or for personal preferences. Thanks for a delicious recipe! UPDATE- I used the brown sugar in the topping this time and it was way too sweet. I'll make it again w/o the brown sugar in the topping like the first time.",

I mixed it together with only 3 tablespoons of butter and all the other ingredients ( I added the beaten eggs last so they wouldn't cook in the mixing bowl.)
