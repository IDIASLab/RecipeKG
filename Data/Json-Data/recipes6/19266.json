(which I did I customized the recipe a tad) in place of the oil I upped the pumpkin/applesauce to equal the amount of oil that would have been used. I omitted the white sugar and just used 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar. Also added 2 tbsp ground flax seed....VERY yummy moist muffin - I used paper liners though and should have heeded others saying to just grease a tin and head that way as half the muffin was stuck to the liner and I had to eat that part in a not-so-lady-like-way:) oh well only the cat was home to witness it:D I love the flavours of this muffin and will be making these OFTEN! Thanks for the great recipe! Edit upon waiting till the next day the muffins did not stick to the paper liners must have been because they were warm right out of the oven - GOOD STUFF!:D",
