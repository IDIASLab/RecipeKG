My husband who doesn't usually like sweets, can't get  enough of these. The only change I made was chopping the pecans instead of leaving them whole. You've got a real winner here.

Very smooth caramel sauce - and no soggy rolls.  They were so delicious!\nWhat an awesome recipe - and now I have some confidence in making yeast breads!\nThank you so much!",
