                "reviewBody": "Great chewy, fudgy brownie IF you eliminate one egg, and add more cocoa (1/4 cup).  No baking powder, or else it will rise too much like a cake.  Not really deep dish, but just  regular size thickness. And make it easy on yourself folks, this can be a one-bowl recipe. I just add all the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and slowly stir until it's all incorporated.  Definitely increase cocoa and add 3 tablespoons sugar to compensate.  I also used just 1/2 stick of butter and 1/4 cup applesauce and it was super moist and hopefully a smidge healthier.  This is a really easy recipe and quick and fun to do with kids.  Why use stuff from a box with all those preservatives when this is soooo easy. Bake no longer than 35 min in 8x8 square pan.  Tip for all brownie recipes: grease only the bottom of your pan, not the sides to avoid burning or turning too crisp or dark on the sides of the brownies.  With a few changes, this one is my master recipe.",

When the brownies were nearly done I topped them with more crumbled Oreos and miniature marshmallows and popped them under the broiler for a minute or two until the marshmallows were melted and a light golden brown. To gild the lily even further I finished them with a drizzle of melted chocolate chips. It takes a good, reliable recipe to mess with it that much!",

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13. These were everything a brownie should be - chewy fudgy wonderful! I will make these again and again! Thanks! Update Just wanted to let you all know that I made these with baking Splenda and they did beautifully and tasted delicious! Another Update - It's been a longtime since I found this recipe I make it all the time. The only thing I have changed is that we don't use choc chips anymore. This is still a major hit!",

                "reviewBody": "These brownies tasted great! They even get the nice little flaky layer on top! I waited until they completely cooled before cutting. I also only used 2 eggs and omitted the baking powder but you shouldn't listen to other reviewers when they say it only needs to baked for half an hour. The recipe says to bake 40 to 45 minutes I did 40 and even after they cooled the middle brownies were still battery in the center and you could taste the rawness. My friend liked it because she likes gooey things but I myself prefer the taste of doneness. So if you know that you have an oven that usually bakes things a bit faster than others decrease the baking time by all means. But if you usually have to bake things for a longer time than the recipe calls for (like me) then stick to the suggested baking time and maybe even extend it a little. Not all ovens are the same so basically just know what type of oven you have.",
