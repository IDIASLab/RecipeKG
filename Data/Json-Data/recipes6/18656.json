I wound up using 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup AP because I needed to shop and it still came out just wonderful.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and I think that is just enough.  We prefer savory to sweet.  I also baked it in a 8\" square pan because I don't have a 10\" cake pan and kept my fingers crossed that it would not over flow.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.",

The taste was good the fennel was subtle and I liked it the first day. The second day the crust had lost some of it's crispness and wasn't nearly as good. To salvage it I decided to toast it which did improve it somewhat. I doubt that I'll be making this one again but it was fun to try.",
