If I was making them again, I would not chop a chocolate bar by hand but buy the pre-chopped Hershey chocolate chunks.  Also, rather than coarsely chopping the candy canes (which took a LONG time), I'd grind them in the food processor to a very fine consistency.  Then you still get the flavor without large hard pieces in the cookie that might crack a tooth.  I think this recipe does have some potential if someone is willing to take the time to experiment.",

They are not very sweet though so I drizzled them with milk chocolate and they tasted great! They look very festive and took no time at all to make!",

I did make a few changes to the recipe: lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees I had no candy bars so I used mini chocolate chips and I added a few drops of red food coloring. Also somebody mentioned that they used wax paper I think parchment paper will work better... they didn't stick at all. I think when I put them out for company (if there are any left by Christmas Eve!) I'll dust them with powdered sugar. Thanks for a great recipe Loren!",

Crush candy canes pretty finely. Otherwise they melt during baking leaving a big hole in your cookie and causing them to break. Make cookies smaller than you might think you need to; they spread. Bonus: You get a LOT of cookies per batch. I needed to bake mine 11-12 minutes. Test your first batch. My DH pronounced them \"GREAT!\"",

I only made a couple of changes as suggested by other reviewers...1 cup of chocolate chips and on the first batch I made I added several drops of red food coloring since it seemed mostly white after I crushed the candy cane. Well some cookies look fine others look like open surgery! So the next batch I didn't add the food coloring and there was still plenty of red flecks in the cookies-a good lesson learned! The cookies are fabulous and I'm not even a huge peppermint fan-thanks for a fun recipe!",
