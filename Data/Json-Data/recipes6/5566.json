I also used about 3 tblsp of olive oil to cook the okra and onions then poured in a pouch of real bacon bits. I used fresh okra and cherry tomatoes from our garden with two nice spicey chopped jalepeno peppers. And just poured in a can of whole kernel corn (drained). The flavors were wonderful together and gave it just the right amount of \"bite\" that my family enjoys. We served it hot over cornbread. A definite hit for my family. Will be making this again.
