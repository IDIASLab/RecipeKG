Since it's a type of carrot cake I used 1/2 c. candied pineapple for the candied fruit and regular fruit cake mix for the other 1/2 c. of candied fruits. The day of serving I topped it with icing made from a 7.5 oz. container of pineapple cream cheese spread and 2 c. confectioners' sugar then garnished the top with candied cherries and pineapple.

It definitely reminds you of a fruitcake but the cinnamon and addition of the carrots produced a lighter cake more like the texture of a carrot cake.

I did use dried cranberries instead of raisins because that is what I had in my pantry.",
