The corn syrup acts as a stabilizer, and reduces crystalization, so I'll be curious to see how this ice cream fares after a few days--if it lasts that long! I used 1 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. half and half (experience has proven I like that ratio best) and added 1 tsp. vanilla to the cooked custard. I pureed about 2/3 of the strawberries in the food processor, then added the remaining strawberries and pulsed just to chop them up a bit.  It was the perfect combination. This is  intensely strawberry with a beautiful, vibrant color. I am anxious to try this with raspberries and blueberries!",

                "reviewBody": "This is very good if you want a basic, lovely strawberry ice cream recipe. I love to make ice cream and have been making it for many years. The only thing I would say is that you will need to stir your custard as it is heating. Remember to not let it boil! If you do not stir, your yolk will not properly incorporate and you will get cooked egg lumps. I imagine this is why she added the seive step. You will not need to draw it through a seive if you stir and keep the ingredients together. It will not take 5 minutes when you continually stir it. It is probably closer to about 15 to 20 before it coats the back of a spoon. It will give you a nice creamy texture and the ice cream will be very smooth. I promise! :) I also added fresh cut strawberries to the mixture at the last five minutes of my ice cream machine's cycle.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a very good, flavorful ice cream.  I made a couple of changes for ease more than flavor, and a couple for flavor.    For flavor, I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the berry puree.  I used a ratio of 2/3 heavy cream to 1/3 half and half - this gives a better overall ice cream texture.    For ease, I whisked the 1/3 part half and half with the egg yolks until it appeared completely mixed in, then added the sugar and corn syrup and stirred until desolved.  I poured the mixture directly into a cold pot and added the cream, them whisked until completely blended.  I heated over low heat, then once hot, increased the temp to medium low and cooked until mixture coated the back of a metal spoon.    Doing this eliminates the need to strain, and also eliminates the possibility of your yolks turning into cooked egg bits.    Adding corn syrup is great if the ice cream maker you are using has a metal mixing container.  Many times the metal gets too cold and the mixture will stick to the insides like a sorbet.  This did not happen with this recipe!  I had perfect, flavorful ice cream.    This recipe is also a good base for other flavors of ice cream, and not just of the berry variety.  I definitely plan to experiment.  We will use this recipe time and time again!  It's a winner.  Thank you to Christy J for sharing it.",
