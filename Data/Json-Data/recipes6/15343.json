I even tinted them with red food coloring. I tasted them a few days after baking and they were still too salty. I asked a couple of friends to try them and they agreed there was a definite salty aftertaste. I finally ended up not giving them to my grandchildren and throwing out the cookies. There is definitely something wrong with the use of 1/2 teasp of baking soda and 1/2 teasp of salt. Next time I would definitely reduce those amounts. I wish I had read the other review where someone also thought them too salty before I went to all the work of baking them and decorating them.",
