I put the ice cream in my ice cream maker for about 25 min.  Put it in the freezer for about 2 hours.  Take it out and let it soften a little and serve.  It was wonderful!!

I used homemade vanilla (from this website), so the ice cream had little specks of vanilla bean in it, and was nice and creamy.  The instructions say to mix the ingredients together IN the freezer container of the ice cream maker; don't do that if you have the kind of ice cream maker with the already-frozen canister!  Mix them in a bowl and then add to the ice cream maker!  Oh, I also scaled it down to 8 servings for my 1.5qt ice cream maker; it didn't make a lot; I think 16 servings would be about right for a full recipe. Thanks for the recipe, Jackie!",

Tip for keeping it soft even after it's been in the freezer for a while: don't add the cream to the mix before it goes into the ice cream mixer. While the freezer is working, use an electric mixer to whip the cream into stiff peaks. After the freezer stops, let the iced mix harden for about ten minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the iced mix until combined. Allow to harden for at least two hours in the freezer or it will be too soft to serve.",
