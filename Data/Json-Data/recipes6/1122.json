'Soaked about 3/4c dried apples & 1c oats in 1/4c apple juice concentrate & 1/3c applesauce; adding 1/2c water when I thought it wasn't going to do \"the trick.\" I'll go with 1/3c next time. Whisked together 1/3c oil & 1/3c brown sugar (coulda reduced since adding the sugar in the juice concentrate). Beat in the egg & 1t vanilla. Then added the oat mixture. Recipe states 1/4t ginger in & 1/2 on. 1/2 in still had nonexistent ginger flavor) 1t if again). 1c flour 1 1/2t baking powder & 1/2t salt (needs more). Oh & 1/4c wheat germ.:) Well even with apples apple juice & applesauce these didn't taste all that much like apples. 'Think apple is a difficult flavor to achieve without plenty of apples. Anyway good moist muffs. I topped with plain bread crumbs (Sneaky!) These will be the type to get fuzzy quickly so eat up!",
