Served it topped w/ syrup and homemade sweetened whipped cream.\nOne last thing, I dont appreciate the person who (just a few comments down) blasted people for commenting on ways in which they had to or wanted to change the recipe. FYI: some people dont always have all the exact ingredients on hand and have to improvise or sometimes they just change things because they feel like it; Nothing wrong with that! By stating these improvisations, they are helping other people who don't have all the exact ingredients on hand or helping the people who don't always want to follow recipes to the T. Once again, nothing wrong w/ that!",

Also, doubled the cinnamon and added about 1 t nutmeg.  Mix the cream cheese with the eggs, one at a time.  Add in the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the bread & mix well.  Then stir in the bread and pour the mixture into a prepared 9X15 pan and let sit for about 15 minutes.  (I used white sandwhich bread, lightly toasted.  If you're using a hard, dry bread, overnight would be best.)  Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.  This came out perfect and my boys' finicky taste buds LOVED it!  Additionally, I've made this with cinnamon raisin bread. Ooohh, YUM!  A big hit at church!",

Looks like a 5 star to me though. Ok here are the facts: Reviewing a recipe which you have changed in not reviewing the recipe... I seldom follow a recipe exactly just because its the way I am. I like to play. The only way to review a recipe is to make it as its described and then rate it. If you change things the next time then say Its rated () as is but... I found it much better when I made it with \"these changes\". Or add a custom version to the custom version tab (should be obvious). Don't make changes and rate the recipe as you changed it because then its not the recipe we are evaluating and it isnt helpful to anyone and its then just an ego trip you are on. There is nothing wrong with suggesting alternatives that you like but its not fair to any of us if you rate anything other than the original... Sorry thats just the honest facts people. I do love to read about the alternatives don't get me wrong. I just don't like when a cook reviews the recipe based on those changes. By all means HAVE FUN and BE CREATIVE!!!! Haha..",

I like the reviews because I can see what works and what doesn't and exchange ideas with other cooks.  \nFor the people who got soggy bread, try using larger chunks of bread and maybe a shallower pan like a large cookie sheet with sides.  \nWhat I did:  eyeballed the eggs and milk, yep I like to live dangeriously! Mixed up the custard in a measuring cup using 3 eggs to start and eyeballing the milk and sugar, used cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla and a shot of brandy for extra flavor.  Poured the custard over the bread in a bowl and mixed it with my hands to see how the dry/wet ratio was.  Needed more wet so mixed another egg with a little milk and there you go!  Placed it in a single layer in a greased pan, sprinkled on more sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and drizzled with melted butter.  \nThis recipe is so versitle you could use egg nog in place of the milk for holidays or add cubes of cream cheese and or strawberry preserves for a stuffed french toast, even adding a little orange peel would change the flavor.  Be creative, have fun!",

The egg nog gave this dish an excellent flavour, next time I will add 1 cup of egg nog and the rest milk or cream.",
