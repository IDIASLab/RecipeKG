The leaner the beef the shorter the dehydrator time and the safer the finished product. We used round steak but found it still too fatty. We will use top round or some other type of leaner beef next time. However the flavor was perfect..and no nitrites like store-bought jerky. Much cheaper too! We did not change anything in this recipe. Thanks Mike.",
