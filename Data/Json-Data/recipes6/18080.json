I recommend adding the pinch of salt to the eggs before mixing then once the froth starts to form add 1/8 tsp cream of tarter (not sure if this is kosher) per egg white (this helps keep the eggs stiff when you add the other ing.) and once the eggs become med stiff add the sugar in a few quick shakes and maybe after 10 sec or so add the cocoa mix also in a few quick shakes. Only mix 10 more sec. just enough to blend the cocoa in. The more you mix after the dry ingredients are added the eggs whites become liquidy. Play it on the safe side less mixing is better to keep the egg whites stiff. You're looking for a fluffy consistency. I think I used the mixer for two minutes total. I used the mini chips and the baking paper and they came out great. A light fluffy chocolatey treat.",
