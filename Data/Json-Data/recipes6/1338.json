The Golden Mushroom creates a much richer sauce with chunks of mushrooms.\nI trimmed the roast of fat and cut it up into serving size chunks (Not too small).\nI was thoroughly impressed with the flavor of the gravy and served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veg\u2019s. Everyone loved it.\nThanks for sharing great recipe.",
