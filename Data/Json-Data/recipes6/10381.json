(The only change I make to the dough portion is that I add some \"Italian\" seasonings- oregano, garlic powder, and pepper) I make 1 and 1/2 of the recipe, split the dough into 8 pieces, and then flatten and stretch it into small pizza shapes.  Then, I put the stuffing in (NO PIZZA SAUCE) and pull all of the sides up and seal all of the toppings inside.  (we use motz. and pepperoni for my kids and husband, and I love sauted onions and garlic with motz. and cheddar cheese for my toppings!) I bake  them for 20-30 minutes, and then we use pizza sauce to dip them in.  \r\n\r\nMy kids would rather have these than delivery pizza!  It is their favorite meal!\r\n\r\n",

One thing that I have learned: make sure to buy quality meats, the more quality the less grease that runs off. I always have marinara sauce on the side for dipping.

I cut the dough into 6x6\" pieces and formed them like \"hot pockets\". Still munching on leftovers (it makes alot for four) 3 days later! My husband and I fought over the last 1/2. I made the dough ahead & folded it in thirds and refridgerated it while fixing the rest. Pulled it out puched it down rolled to final size sliced filled sealed and baked as directed. I also added 1 xtra Tbls. sugar and a 2 second count of olive oil to the dough and did not do this in a bread machine. Very versatile dough! Outstanding! Easy! Thanks for submitting this recipe! Also baking on parchment paper keeps it from sticking over browning and makes clean up easy.",
