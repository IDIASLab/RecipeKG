These pickles were absolutely awesome and really easy to make!   The only thing I did different was can them. Everyone that had them thought they were wonderful and I had many requests for more jars.  I only made 1 case of small jars and 3 large mason jars full, but this coming summer I am planning to be a little more ambitious and make more.  I did make one variation on some of the jars which I think came out fantastic and that was that I had dehydrated red cayenne peppers and I added 1 to some of the smaller jars and 3 or 4 to the large jars.  Not only did it add color to the jar, but they really tasted great, especially if you are a spice fan!  I added more onion to my pickles as that was the way that I remembered them from my childhood.  My Nanny made some of the best Bread and Butter pickles that I have ever tasted....these are certainly close to her recipe!:)",

I'm a Southerner at heart and love the sweetness. They were quick and easy although I did try doubling and tripling which caused me to have to microwave them a bit longer. I tried making them with and without garlic and didn't notice a big difference but didn't add that much garlic. I also tried totally peeling the cukes as I felt the skins were a bit tough but they just didn't look the same. After filling the hot jars I stuck them in a boiling water bath for about 10 minutes and they sealed immediately so I can enjoy throughout the winter. I used regular cukes (not English) and sweet Vidalia onions. IN fact I may have added a bit more onion than called for. Next time I may add a bit of sweet red pepper for color. I gave some to my friend and she said her mom CRIED when she ate them as they reminded her of the pickles she helped her Mom make when she was a kid. That's a true testimony!",
