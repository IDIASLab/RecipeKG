I think its' the perfect balance of heavy and light. In response to the previous review be sure to add the flour slowly with a sprinkling motion and whisk constantly. I have added cocoa powder to this recipe and it makes a delightful chocolate frosting as well! (I didn't note how much.. just sprinkle it in to taste) 5 stars well deserved!",

This is one of the best frostings I have ever made. It is very creamy looks like whipped cream and taste great too. It does take a little time to prepare since it has to be cooked and cooled but well worth the extra time. This cake will need to be stored in a cool place since the frosting contains milk.",

I'm wondering if the recipe means \"powdered sugar\"????? June 2010.  Revised: I have learned extra fine, or Baker's Sugar works well.  I use Cook's South Seas Vanilla... Oh, Yum!  Use butter instead of shortening for better flavor too.  At times I also add a bit of almond and brandy flavor to that... Not enough to be obvious.. only to enhance.

This makes a much thicker base for the icing.  Also, I use butter, NOT margarine. I think the real trick is to beat the sugar/butter/ shortening mix for TEN minutes. Start your mixer, then go look at allrecipes.com for a while.  Add the milk/flour mixture, then beat it another TEN minutes.  You'll find with a thicker base and a longer beating time, you'll have a wonderful creamy icing.  One other thing...use Crisco.  The taste and texture depend on it. I've tried store brands and they just don't do it.",
