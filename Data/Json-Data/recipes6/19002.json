The peaches and cherries tasted great together and complimented perfectly! I didn't have any shortening so I used 1 c butter. The cooking time seemed right on. All in all the only thing I would change would be to cut down on some of the topping. There was just a bit too much so you didn't taste as much fruit as I'd like to just a mouth full of sugar! I would say cut the topping by 1/4 or even 1/3. I'm going to experiment to find which is best. Oh also I had a little juice spill out so it got burnt on the coil. It smelled AWFUL!

Also, before I topped the fruit with the crumble, I added 4 pieces of Neufchatel cheese (1 TB each) to the top of the fruit.  Then, I topped with the crumble and baked.
