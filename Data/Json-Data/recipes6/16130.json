Everyone loved it but I'll share what I think are necessary modifications:\n\n-I would do only half gingersnap and then the other half graham cracker (or nilla wafer) for the crust... this keeps it sweet and light without compromising the ginger kick.\n\n-I also added about a half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.\n\n-And as someone suggested... I made the filling first so it could refrigerate while I did the crust.  This made the marble effect work... and not \"runny\" like others have stated.",

The 2nd time, I did what other have recommended and added more spice to the pumpkin cheesecake mixture (nothing specific, a couple shakes of clove, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg), but after reading a lot of \"how to make cheesecake\" websites i decided against refrigerating the mix before baking- the marbling looked perfect without it- and, unlike the first time i made it, i didn't whip the mixture \"to make it fluffy.\" Apparently air is bad for cheesecakes.  I was also very careful to make temperature changes gradual; starting with room temp cream cheese and eggs, not refrigerating the batter, and baking the cake at 325 instead of 350, with a pan of water set on the lowest rack of the oven to increase humidity in the oven. I let the cake bake a full 45 minutes before i even peeked (which, btw, it was hard not to look!) and then when the cake was still slightly soft and jiggly in the middle (around 55 mins), turned the oven off, propped open the door with a peice of full rolled up to keep the oven door about 2\" open, and let it rest in the oven for about an hour. Moved to the counter, slid a knife around the edge, covered with a plate, rest another hour, and then rest in the fridge for about 4 more hours. Lots of resting! But in the end, this cake came out PERFECTLY, with not even a crack in site! the texture was exactly right for a cheesecake, and it was yummy, yummy, yumm",
