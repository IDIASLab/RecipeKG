Really easy to make and with the addition of sliced portabello mushrooms and sugar snap peas along with the broccoli it made for a yummy veggie filled stir fry. I wasn't able to find guava nectar in my local grocery store so I used 1/3 C. of freshly squeezed orange juice and it made for delicious sauce. I was hoping for leftovers but the boys ate every single bite so it was a big hit in our house. Will definately make this again.",
