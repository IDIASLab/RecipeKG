The first batch stuck together in a giant rectangle in the oven and I had to cut them into slices! Even then they still seemed sticky although eventually set once I'd laid them on a plate to cool. The second batch almost stuck together and still didn't seem to be set. The third batch I added almost half a cup more flour to and they turned out much better. Also they took at least 30 minutes to cook if not more. I always thought gas ovens cooked faster but obviously not in this case. I liked these cookies although they weren't a favourite but fiance loved them as he really likes coconut and walnuts. So I'll probably have to make them again some time. They were a lot of fuss to make but now that I know to skip the milk they should work out better next time. Try these if you have a lot of time and patience and skip the milk! EDIT: I made these again minus the milk. They still took 20 minutes to cook but were much much better. I'll definitely be making these again now that I know they're far better without the milk.",
