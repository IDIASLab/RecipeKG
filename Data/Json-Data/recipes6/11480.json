Delicious and no chance of broiling accidents and topping cleanup messes.",

I was a bit worried that the batter was too thick to 'pour' into the pan but it was better once the softened oats were added.  This is Delicious... both warm with ice cream or cold... And I would never have thought I'd say that about an oatmeal cake!\nUpdate:  I have been making this cake regularly for the past three years... It is requested by family members all the time and coworkers love it... It disappears in minutes.  It cuts up nicely so it's easy to transport.  Truly a winner recipe!   Oh, and definitely follow the recipe and broil the topping... It gives it a nice browned tastey flavor!\nLastly, I have made this for people that do not eat coconut so have made it without...  instead just double the nuts in the topping.  Still tastes amazing!",
