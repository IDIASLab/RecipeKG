I followed this recipe to the letter and, unfortunately, the biggest issue is with the cupcakes\u2019 texture.  For lack of a better word,  they\u2019re gummy, not at all cake-like.  The batter barely rose to the top of the muffin tin, either flat or actually caved in on the top, very little rise.  And filling the muffin tin cups 3/4 full, I only ended up with 8 cupcakes, not 12.  My husband and I split one, and then the rest went into the trash (and I haven\u2019t done that often).  Not sure what happened, but this was a major disappointment, and I won\u2019t be making again.   Now heading to kitchen to start the cleanup.  So sorry for the bad review, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying, but reviews need to be honest.",
