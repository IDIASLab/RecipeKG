I browned the beef,onion,garlic, and pepper together, and threw all the ingredients together into the slowcooker. I used one can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of diced italian tomatoes, and one can of tomato sauce.  Let it slow cook on low for 5 hours, with a tad bit of water. Then tossed with pasta later and topped with parm cheese. It was sooo wonderful, when you let it cook on low for a long time the flavor is just wonderful!",

I left out the green pepper, because I didnt have any on hand, and used only diced tomatoes, because once again, that was all I had.  I also left out the sugar all together and added a can of tomato sauce (I dont care for the taste of tomato paste), 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and a pinch of baking soda to take out some of the acidity, which ends up turning the acid to sugar and makes it taste a bit sweeter so it doesnt need the sugar after all!  Wonderfull recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
