I made home made egg noodles. This did not add to the recipe as I hoped it would. Save yourself some time and buy the packaged noodles. Next time I think Iwill double the white sauce and mix half of it with the noodles...then layer as directed. Also as far as the directions go I always saute and drain my meat before I add my vegetables. This way I don't throw any flavor of the vegetables out with the grease. Also I used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan. Thanks Donna.",
