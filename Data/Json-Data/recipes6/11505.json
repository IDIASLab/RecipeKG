I did however have to apply baking experience know- how to come out with a great tasting product that looks just as appetizing. I cut cinnamon in half. Beat in eggs one at a time alternate dry ingred. with the milk. Take the time to spread batter even and to all corners of pan---spoon apple little by little over batter then spread even with a spatula. Crumble b. sugar with clean hands slowly over cake and spoon (i used baby spoon) butter over the topping. Great!!! A keepee.",
