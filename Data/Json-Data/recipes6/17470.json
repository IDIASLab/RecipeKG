They are fabulous though- I think the yeast lends a more tender texture to the biscotti which is wonderful. I did not have ricotta on hand so I drained cottage cheese and used that. I also used the dough hook on my stand mixer instead of a bread machine. The dough came out smooth and flexible much like bread dough and formed beautiful loaves. I had to bake the sliced cookies in the oven longer than what the recipe called for... I would recommend turning down the oven temp on the second bake and keeping them in there longer to dry out more. The ganache recipe to dip them in is great- wonderful flavor and it lends a nice \"biteable\" covering for the cookie! I took these to a scrapbooking party and they were a HUGE hit! I will certainly make again!",

One batch I used walnuts and the other cherry extract. They turned out so nice and crisp. Also if the batter is a little sticky to work with just put a small amount of oil on your hands and pat it out. Works perfectly. Did you notice...? no butter! Had it of called for butter though I would have used canola or olive oil anyway. It is a much healthy choice and is just as good. I make lots of biscotti and am always playing with the recipes. This one is GREAT! Try it!!",
