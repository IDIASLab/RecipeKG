First of all, as with any yolk custard, you want everything ready ahead of time. Do NOT mix the water with the egg yolks. Beat the yolks separately. Use only 3 tbl of Corn Starch. Add the dry ingredients to the pot to the pot, then add the water. Heat on med stirring constantly until thick and bubbly. Mixture will be VERY thick. Temper mixture into the yolks slowly until you have incorporated half of the mixture into the yolks. Scoop the yolk mixture back into the pan and cook for exactly one more minute. Remove from heat and blend in the lemon juice. Then blend in the butter and beat for 30 seconds. I think you will find a better taste and texture with this method.",

I used it for a filling for a white cake so I whipped some whipping cream and used about 1/2 whipped cream 1/2 lemon custard and it was all the rave.",

I did make a few slight modifications: I have made this twice and the second time used a little less sugar. I beat egg yolks in the bowl and added the lemon juice and a little zest. In a saucepan I melted the sugar butter and salt in half the water. I whisked the corn starch in the other half of the water then once everything was melted added the starch water and cook until desired consistency. Then I added the sugar mixture to the egg mixture in small amounts until well blended. I used this to make lemon crepes and lemon tarts. I love it. I tried the lemon flavored jello and this recipe has a much better flavor.",
