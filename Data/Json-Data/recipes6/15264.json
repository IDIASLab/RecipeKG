I let it bake on parchment paper and it was done in exactly fifteen minutes. I'm not crazy about coffee fillings so I used one from another chocolate torte recipe that's absolutely fabulous: 1 c. heavy whipping cream 1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese 2/3 c. dark brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. In a large bowl combine softened cream cheese dk. brown sugar and vanilla. Beat until soft. In a separate chilled bowl whip cream to form soft peaks. Then fold into cream cheese mixture. It's hard to resist a chocolate torte!",
