Without trying to sound too snarky, I have to add a comment to fellow reviewers.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when somebody changes most of the ingredients in a recipe and then has the nerve to rate it with 1 or 2 stars & give it a bad review. Seems to me that you might have ruined the recipe yourself with the changes & that if you'd followed the recipe as written you may have liked it. If you made changes to a recipe thinking you'd improve it & you didn't, it's rude to then come back here & blame the creator of it for your error.  I'm just sayin'.....",
