One jar is just enough for 2 servings and I can eat that before the cake dries out. Plus, I don't have to turn on the over to bake very often. I usually make 2 or 3 different recipes and that will get me thru at least 6 months. I have given these as presents to folks in nursing homes, college, or away from home for extended periods. I like the idea of sending them to the troops in Iraq a lot! I may just have to do something like that for christmas this year. \nBTW, you can use any cake recipe that uses baking powder. I have canned banana bread, spice cake, marble cake and many others. Just make sure you never fill the jar more than half full and keep plenty of space between the jars to ensure even baking. \nThanks for a great recipe and a great idea for Christmas this year.",
