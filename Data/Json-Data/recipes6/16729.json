I checked all of the ratings before I started the recipe and there was a great number of reviews that mentioned it didn't cook all the way and that it needed another cup of flour. So I added a extra cup of flour and I added 3/4 cup of each chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. The bread came out done my husband even thought it was burned until I told him it had brown sugar in it. The main issue is that I love very moist banana bread and this was not moist at all. It was very dry and little sweetness flavor in it. I think it needed another banana and maybe a little less flour than the xtra cup. Some people like their bread dry instead of super moist. I am affraid if I hadn't added that flour I may have had uncooked bread but it didn't need an entire xtra cup. All bread machines are different when they cook so maybe that was why everyone had some of the different issues. With the walnuts and chocolate chips it needed to be a little more moist and probably another banana! Thanks for the recipe! It is defininately something I can work with to make what I want! Keep rollin in those recipes! I love em!",
