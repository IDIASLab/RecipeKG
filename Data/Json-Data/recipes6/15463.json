Oddly enough I've never found anyone who came from somewhere outside of New England who was brought up with this classic. Guess it's an acquired taste. Pity. The flavor is simple and uncomplicated like many recipes of this era such as bread pudding rice pudding etc. It was born of relative poverty when most households had little extra for desserts. Frugality dictated that women use what they had. I made this to take to my ailing mom and she loved it. Added just a little cinnamon plus a dash of lemon extract to offset the sweetness. Some finely grated lemon rind would be a nice addition. Sets up firmly yet soft. Thumbs up on this one!",

I found this recipe to be just OK -- one that I would make only if I had to when my pantry was bare. My husband gave it 4 stars but because it was a tad on the sweet side took so long to bake and was not appealing to me I gave the rating two stars. I will not be making this again. There are too recipes to make and so little time.",

Also I didn't have my turkey roaster pan available so I just couldn't it without the water bath. It took about 60 minutes to cook. Very tasty with a nice texture. A tad sweet--will try using 2/3 cup sugar next time.",

By the way there is no need for the towel under the pan. Just place the deep 8x8 baking dish inserted into a pan of hot water and bake. I also use cooking spray in my baking dish to make it easier to seperate from the sides of the dish. I modify the recipie in several ways...I swap part of the sugar with maple syrup and a add at least 1 tsp of cinnamon to the liquid before I add the grapenuts. Our family loves the flavors of cinnamon and maple.",
