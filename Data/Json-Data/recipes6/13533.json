It's very similar to my chess pie recipe and I knew that the 45 minutes wouldn't be enough time in the oven, so I lowered the oven to 300 and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours, the way my chess pie is done, and it came out beautifully. A 9\" deep dish pie crust held it all nicely. For those who have had a problem with spilling the filling on the way to the oven; put the crust on a cookie sheet, set it on the oven rack and then pour the filling in, slide the rackin carefully. This prevents spills and catches any cook-over mess in the oven. This pie was very good, but I won't make it again. The taste is very, very close to a pumpkin pie - and I don't like pumpkin pie.",
