I'm going to have to say I liked it better flourless but either way it is so good.  Instead of melting the chocolate and butter over the stove I just put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred it and then put it in for 20 more seconds and it was the perfect consistency-much faster and easier.",

I also made them in a 12 cup muffin pan lined with baking cups (makes clean up, etc. super easy).  I spread a rounded teaspoon of the brownie mix on the bottom, then spread out the cheesecake mix evenly amongst the cups, then topped with remaining brownie mix and swirled the tops a bit with a knife.  This baked up just like cupcakes!  I bet they would taste awesome with a cream cheese frosting or something.  Another good thing is that this recipe is really easy, versatile, inexpensive and doesn't require a lot of ingredients - I had everything but the cream cheese and chocolate chips already.  Also, can be made to your own liking - the possibilities for flavor combinations is endless.  Maybe next time I'll try white chocolate chips, or butterscotch.  Or flavor the cheesecake.  The only thing that I didn't like was the chocolate somewhat over powered the cheesecake.  I'll cut back on the amount of chips in the cheesecake next time.  Baked for 25 mins, although I think they could of used a few more minutes. Thanks for the recipe - will make these again and again!  ",

I used a 9x9 silicone pan, I followed the directions exactly--including the makeshift double boiler, and they baked beautifully.  The texture was a perfect brownie texture.  To avoid the gooey mess that doesn't bake in the center, never bake brownies in ceramic or glass...just my experience with them. The recipe works very well as written.  The reasons we were disappointed with this recipe:  (1)This recipe managed to dirty up an entire sink full of dishes, and it was a complete pain to put together. (2)The chocolate flavor overtook the recipe, and the cheesecake flavor disappeared into the background. I really wanted to taste and feel that cheescake layer.  It just wasn't there. I should've realized it would be like that since the recipe calls for 2 cups (practically an entire bag) of chocolate chips. I probably won't make these again.  I think it would be much better without chocolate chips in the cream cheese layer, but I can't recommend this recipe to anyone who loves cheesecake and is trying to get a dessert with that flavor in it.  It's just not what we thought it would be...and it's just not worth the amount of mess you have to create to make these.",
