                "reviewBody": "I was a little worried about this recipe when I poured the batter/dough into the bread pan. First I must say that I had to substitute for the applesauce - I didn't have any. I didn't want to use oil so I used plain yogurt (I know not cool for vegans but?). And I used a whole can of pumpkin (15 oz.) instead of the 1 c. called for in the recipe. Since these two substitutions seemed to make the wet ingredients even wetter I used a little more flour - a little over 3/4 c. regular wheat flour (I didn't have pastry flour) and about 1 1/4 c. bread flour. Because of these alterations I also modified the spices and baking powder ever-so-slightly. So why did I worry? There was a ton of batter! I probably could have put this into 2 pans. I didn't though. What worried me even more is when I dipped my finger in one of the spatula trails left in my mixing bowl and took a lick it was pretty bland. I wondered if it was because this recipe uses a fraction of the sugar called for in other recipes or if I didn't add enough spices or what?! Well I stuck some pecans in the top of my loaf and stuck it in the oven and hoped for the best. What came out was one of the BEST loaves of pumpkin bread ever! It was plenty sweet and otherwise flavorful and moist. It was beautiful! I can't wait to try it with applesauce and the pecans mixed right in (instead of just on top). Thanks so much for this wonderfully nutritious low-fat creature-friendly treat!",

I upped the water to 8 tablespoons, added 2 tablespoons of molasses, used an entire 15-oz can of pumpkin and left out the applesauce altogether, reduced the sugar to 3/4 a cup of brown sugar, changed the flour to two cups of white spelt flour (can't eat wheat), upped the baking powder to a full teaspoon, and changed the spices and amounts--2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger.  I kept the nutmeg the same, but changed the salt to a scant teaspoon, and I sprinkled the dough with brown sugar before baking.  I also divide the recipe between two 7x5 bread tins and bake them together for 47 minutes.  In the space of a week, I've made at least ten loaves, and my husband and friends have gobbled up every crumb!  The bread comes out very dense, very moist and plenty sweet, but when divided into 8 thick pieces per loaf, each piece only has 108 calories, almost no fat, and only 30 carbs--less than a small box of raisins.  Makes a delicious, filling afternoon snack!",
