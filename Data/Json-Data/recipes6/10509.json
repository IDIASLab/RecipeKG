The dough also is quite spongy when shaping for loaf - that is normal so don't try and squeeze all the gas out. Baked for 25 mins @ 400F middle shelf.",

I bake mine for about 25 minutes and it has a nice density and chewiness that I enjoy. I brush mine with melted butter rather than mist with water. GREAT for morning toast w/ a pat of butter. Mmm!",
