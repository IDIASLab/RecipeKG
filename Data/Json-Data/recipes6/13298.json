Our office has a \"Golden Spoon\" award potluck a couple of times a year - this last one was a Chocolate Lover's. I made this in about an hour and I won the award - I've been waiting 2 years to get close enough to win it (we've got great cooks in the office) So thanks so much for this recipe - the adults just loved it. So if they did I guarantee the kids would too. All I can say is it's great easy and one recipe you can get creative with.",
