I use 1 cup each of Brazil nuts walnuts and pecans or any combination thereof depending on the recipients preferences (one sister does not like Brazil nuts). As for maraschino cherries I use half red and half green. Being sodium conscious I do not add the salt. Also I usually cut the dates and cherries in half especially when using mini-loaf pans.",

I have been making it almost every Christmas since. It isn't your \"ususal\" fruitcake. Love the nuts the dates and maraschino cherries together. I have frozen it before for a month or so and it was even more moist than after you bake it. If you like fruitcake a little bit I think you will like this the best.
