I used 1/2 cup and it was still a little dry not crumbly. Also I think the recipe has too MUCH crisp/crust. You could also leave the butter at 1/2 cup and cut the flour and brown sugar back to 2 cups each instead of 2 1/2 cups. Now for the RHUBARB portion it was a bit sour in combination with the sweet of the crust. Also just a tad runny after I let it cool awhile (1 hr) so maybe increase the corn starch to 5 T (I used 4 T instead of 1/4 cup). And lastly I increased the baking time to 40 to 45 minutes.:-) Be sure to place something on the rack below the baking pan as this recipe does seem to bubble over like a pie would.",

I tripled the amount of butter the recipe suggests. It's still kinda crunchy but I don't think it's dry. This recipe is great. For the bakers who thought the rhubarb was too sour compared to the sweet crust... leave out a little sugar from the curst and for the rhubarb - place all the chopped rhubarb in a microwavable bowl pour a little water on the bottom of the bowl microwave the rhubarb for 2-3 minutes on high in one minute intervals. The steam from the water should make the rhubarb a bit softer and not so sour after baking it in the oven. I also put a little more corn starch on the sugary mixture it wasn't runny at all when I tasted the pie the following day. I cooked the pie for 45 minutes. Thank you for this easy recipe it's delicious.",
