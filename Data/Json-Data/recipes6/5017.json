Also, instead of molasses I used balsamic vinegar. Next time I might add a few red pepper flakes, but it was delicious without it too! I ate a large bowlful and was wishing for some crusty bread to soak up that pot liquor! Very yummy!",

This was still great and would have been even better with the tomatoes as the recipe called for. Getting him to eat the greens can be a challenge as it is so I knew the tomatoes had to go. Next time I make this the tomatoes are going in and I will eat the entire batch myself. Thanks for sharing!",
