                "reviewBody": "Ok... here are the secrets to making this recipe good.  First, you have to toast the almonds.  This brings out the flavor.  Just toast them in the 350 oven for about 7 minutes, let them cool, and then grind them as instructed.  I added more almonds as was recommended, but if you do I would cut back on the flour.  Second, these cookies are basically pecan shortbread cookies, so like all shortbread cookies they should be rolled out, cut/stamped out, and then baked as instructed.  The other reviews were right they dont spread, but neither do rolled out shortbread cookies.  Third, I think that 400 degrees is too hot to bake these cookies.  Mine were pale white on the top and dark brown on the bottom.  They still taste great, but I think you will get a better browning by baking them at 350F.  Hope this helps.",

I used 2 teaspoons almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon hazelnut extract instead of amaretto (which I didn't have). The cookies are very tasty! NOTE: These cookies DO NOT SPREAD. Whatever shape they're in when you put them on the sheet is the shape they'll wind up in so be sure it's an aesthetically pleasant shape! And that two inches apart is silly; I fit 24 cookies per sheet with great success. An excellent little cookie!",

I made these for a Christmas party and they did not last past the first half hour. I didn't have amoretto so I used almond extract approx 1 1/2 tsp (I just poured it in LOL) They do not spread but I liked this fact. I scooped the dough up with a teaspon then rolled it into balls I got about 18 on a small cookie sheet. Then I used sliced almonds and pressed them into the middle. These made little half dollar size cookies that are wonderful!!! I think next time I will try making it with Splenda for a low sugar version that even my diabetic brother in law can eat.

They didn't spread at all though I hadn't expected them to since I had read other reviews. The first pan I left in the shape of the spoon. The second pan I flattened with a fork dipped in granulated sugar (like you would a peanut butter cookie). They aren't bad - but they are not what I was expecting - they don't have enough almond flavoring though I wouldn't call them bland. I am going to try dipping some of them in chocolate. Also I believe that the alcohol cooks out of them in the 400 degree oven so I think they are fine for children. I am not sure if I will make these again.",
