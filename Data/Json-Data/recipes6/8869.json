I used a can of cannellini & also a can of red kidney beans. I used half chicken broth & half beef broth as I didn't want too \"beefy\" a taste & I probably had to increase the liquids by double since I added additional ingredents. I did simmer the rind from the parmesan cheese in the soup...thanks for the tip! I went w/ macaroni instead of seashell pasta (Gosh I made a lot of changes...sorry) & I separated enough soup to have for dinner & then added about half a cup of pasta to it. The rest I froze & will add the pasta when I cook it. That way my macaroni doesn't turn to mush. Served it w/ garlic breadsticks & a ceasar salad. Thansk Marian!",
