I let sit 10 minutes before kneading for 10 minutes adding flour as needed to keep from sticking.\nCover with damp towel for about 2 hours until doubled in size. I then punch down and knead another 2 minutes and place in loaf pan to rise for about 2 hours until way above the pan top. It looks cooked at this point. Bake for 35 minutes @ 350 F.

I of course made this recipe in the middle of the night to occupy my time. And when I woke up, wah-la it was done and cooled. The loaf was super airy, sturdy yet soft and nearly store bakery quality. Using an electric bread knife to cut even slices, turned out just beautifully. I was rather impressed. I was worried about the flavorful but it was very nice as well. I will try this recipe with other seeds or herbs and without as well. Very good, very good...a wonderful keeper for sure!!!",

I did not have any molasses as it is not a flavor I enjoy. I read on-line that a suitable sub is pancake syrup so I used that instead of the molasses. I used this bread to make patty melts from another recipe found on this site (sponsored by the Clorox company). What a wonderful combination of flavors it was! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!",
