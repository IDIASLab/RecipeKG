The steak without the hot sauce & red pepper flakes we thought had both a sweet & savory flavor and we liked it very much. The steak with the hot sauce & red pepper flakes was pretty spicy and seemed a strange combination with our porterhouse steak. It definitely gave it a kick! I would rate the regular marinade a four but the spicy addition to the marinade a three. If you go with the spicy and marinade it a long time you may want to reduce the amount you put in the first time you try it.",
