When I made the filling it wasn't nearly enough to fill the crust (and I can't imagine it would have even filled a 6\" crust) so I whipped up another batch to fill the crust. The filling has a gritty sugary consistency. Had I not doubled the chocolate there would have been very little flavor other than sugar. The other reviews don't seem to be for this dessert either alluding to a \"cake\" so there wasn't much to go on there. THANKS for the recipe!",
