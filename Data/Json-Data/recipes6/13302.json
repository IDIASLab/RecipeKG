The main difference to our recipe is that we add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice or lemon zest to the cream cheese mixture. We love it and bake several each Christmas. To answer a previous reviewer's question: this is how my family bakes it - after baking cream cheese layer let it cool slightly, then top with sourcream mixture and bake again for 5 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool and for best results let it refrigerate overnight or for at least 4 hours.  We think it is best when served cold or room temperature. ",

After I poured the filling into the crust, I heated 1/4 all-fruit raspberry spread in the microwave for 30 seconds.  I drizzled this over the filling and it sank down into the pie.  I cooked as directed and then added the sour cream topping.  The raspberry flavor in the cheesepie was delicious.  It was a big hit at the party I was at.  Thanks for the recipe!",

(I've been baking for thirty years so it's not inexperience)   Is this to be served as a warm, hot, room temp or chilled pie?  Do I bake the filling, chill it and then bake off the topping or leave the whole thing out at room temp before baking it off, or what?   It seems like a cheesecake type of filling which would naturally be served cold but the recipe says to top it and bake it off and then serve.  Confusing!!!  Please, just one more sentence in the recipe would make it crystal clear to all of us.",

I finally got sick of waiting and set out on a mission to find one and, like magic, here this recipe was. My family absolutely loved it and I got my cream cheese pie fix. The only difference I made was to serve it totally chilled. And as a personal note to other cooks, don't cheap out on the pie crust like I did! You'll be happier in the end.",
