Start in the morning of the day before you want to serve. Crush the cranberries and mix with 1 1/2 cups sugar (my grandmother uses 2!! which is a bit much so I use 1 1/2) Mix together and let it rest all day. Drain the juice out at the end of the day and put it back in the fridge. Day of: Drain again, add marshmallows, a big can of crushed pineapple, and 2 cups red seedless grapes, halved. Then right before you want to serve whip the cream and add 1 cup whipped cream to the salad!! This makes it aaaaaaa-mazing!!",

We used a 1/2 c. scoop to serve and the salad kept its shape nicely.",

I came here and searched and located this promising recipe but I was still skeptical. However it is wonderful! Easy to make and tastes great. A great way to add cranberries to the holiday meal. My mom has already requested this be an annual staple at our Thanksgiving table. THANKS! The only changes I made were to use fat free Cool Whip in place of the heavy cream and I added sliced almonds.",

I used 2 cups of ground fresh cranberries a large can of crushed pineapple and a large strained jar of mini mandarin oranges. I let it soak in 1 1/2 cups sugar for several hours straining the juice as necessary. I also used whole mini marshmallows and flavored my whipping cream with a toss of powdered sugar and some vanilla extract. The result was the perfect combination of tart and sweet. I loved it and it went over well at Christmas. Will definitely make this again five stars!",
