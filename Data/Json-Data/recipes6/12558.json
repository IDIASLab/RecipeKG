When they are in the house, my husband can't keep his hand out of the container.  DELICIOUS!  These are easy recipe to make!  I Use evaporated cain juice in place of sugar- still delicious!  I took advice and almost doubled the spices.  Wish I would not have been so scared the first time and did the whole double amount!  I always have since then. I use \"real\" butter in place of shorting.  I used my 1/2 Tablespoon measureing spoon to make them round.  I dipped the measurer in flour before scooping up the dough.  Tapping them out on the side of the mixing bowl made them easy to remove.  They looked to me to be the perfect size of any \"normal\" gingersnap.  When using this way to measure them, a doubled recipe made 126! They are quite a change from your usual hard, crisp ginger sanp.  These are soft and chewy and wonderfully spicy.  I think you'll not be disappointed should you try these!",
