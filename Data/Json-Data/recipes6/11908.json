If you have an undeniable craving for butter this cookie is perfect. Otherwise the taste was lackluster and the texture was horrible (the final product is indeed crumbly -- too much so for my taste). I prefer a cookie you can actually hold onto without it disintegrating or affecting the manner in which it's consumed. With that said the height the cookies are placed in the oven is very important. Not too close to the fire or else you'll end up with black-bottomed uncooked egg/sugar/butter mash.",

Unfortunately the cookies are not as simple to eat. They crumble so easily you almost have to pop them into your mouth at lightening speed. As soon as that cookie hits your mouth though... yummy! The taste reminds me a little of the snow-ball cookies my mom used to make for christmas when I was little. I just wonder how to keep them from crumbling.... These are definately worth trying. Just be prepared for the crumble.",
