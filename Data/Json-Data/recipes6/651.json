YUMMY flavor--my 2.5-year-old and I both love them!  I didn't have enough molasses on hand, so I used probably about 2 Tbsp of corn syrup to make up for what I was missing.  It didn't seem to cause a problem.  For the other gingerbread virgins out there, here is my advice: first of all, when you take the dough out of the fridge, it will seem rock hard.  Don't panic, it softens as you roll it.  Only roll out 1/2 at a time as it gets very soft, very fast.  Second of all, don't forget to MOVE the cookies to a wire rack after 1-2 minutes as listed.  I got busy with my toddler and forgot, and my first batch stuck pretty good to my cookie sheets.  I had to be careful to not crack them to pieces when removing them.  With the next batches, I removed them after 1 minute with no problems at all.  Happy baking!",

After making 8 batches of sugar cookies it was so nice to move to this dough which rolled and sliced so easily. I am an expert baker and I really love this dough! You can up the spice if you are looking for something super spice-laden, but this one is great for kids. A tip for molasses: spray the measuring cup with cooking spray and the molasses just slides right out!",

To avoid rolling out the dough too many times and inevitably adding more flour, I separated the dough into 3 flattened disks before wrapping and refrigerating them. After an hour, I took the dough out of the fridge and rolled out each disk until they were the right thickness (for me, about half a centimeter). I then re-wrapped each disk in plastic and refrigerated them overnight. The next day, I simply unwrapped the disks, placed them onto my floured counter and cut out the gingerbread men!",
