It tasted robust and flavorful, was super easy to make. The ingredients were sort of difficult to find at a smaller supermarket, but I went to Cost Plus World Market and found the chile oil, oyster sauce, etc. Worth the hunt! I love that its all made in one pan - less clean up! I served over sticky rice. The only comment is that it came out very spicy when made as directed. I personally love spiciness, so does my boyfriend, but his mom couldn't eat it due to the heat. You can omit the hot peppers or use olive oil instead of chile oil to take it down a notch. I'll make again!",

The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I still found this recipe to be VERY salty. The salt comes from the oyster sauce and 5 tablespoons is about half of a small bottle of it. Bottom line if you like your food very salty go for it but otherwise I'd reccomend trying some of the other reviewers' suggestions for cutting the salt.",

Perfect to make when you want something good but don't feel like cooking after coming home from a long day's work. I like my food strongly flavored so I did make some changes. I also took note of what other reviewers mentioned I also wanted the dish to be saucy. Sooo I used:5 garlic cloves minced instead of the two suggested I didn't have chili oil or the money to buy it so I used olive oil (which I already had on hand) instead and added 1/2 teaspoon achiote powder to the oil for coloring and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes for heat. I increased the sugar to 2 teaspoons because I added 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of oyster sauce (instead of the 5 tablespoons suggested) to make it saucier. also added about 1 teaspoon of ginger powder. Forgot to mention I also tossed in at the last moment for a crunch about 2 cups of green beans that had been halved. LOVED IT!

I had to buy a lot of items for this recipe so I made adjustments where I could to save money. I used olive oil instead of chili oil and used about 1 and a half tsp dried basil (from a spice rack I already had) instead of fresh. For the hot peppers I wasn't sure what to buy so I bought three small peppers that the produce man said were not too hot. I cut out the insides and sliced into circles to make it pretty. Also I couldn't find oyster sauce only \"oyster-flavoured sauce\" but it worked fine. I used a small can of mushrooms too because I hate having leftover mushrooms in the fridge that I know I'll never use but that doesn't really matter all that much. It turned out delicious juicy flavourful and not too spicy although I did drink lots of water with it. It has a wonderful kick. Definitely serve with rice. My hubby gave this five stars!",
