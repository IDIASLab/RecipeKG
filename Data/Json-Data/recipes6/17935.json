With that being said I decided I was going to step up my fudge game and try one of the \"old fashioned\" fudge recipes (which this is). The keys to this recipe are patience having everything ready before you start and a candy thermometer (sorry I don't have a lot of faith in the cold water test). With that being said this recipe was excellent!!!! If you follow the directions to the \"T\" (I waited until my candy thermometer registered 240) this recipe will turn out as promised. I did add chopped walnuts to the recipe (I like my fudge with nuts) and the fudge was wonderful just like grandma used to make. Also you can't substitute Splenda or any other artificial sweetener - if you're going to do this one leave the fat/calories intact (and trust me I'm not the advocate for leaving those intact). Also if you use a deep saucepan/pot it will keep the mixture from boiling over. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe! I will definitely make this one again.",

Some people don't realize how handy these are. Candy is very tricky and requires a lot of patients. One hint: after it has reached 240 don't let it sit for 10 min beat it immediately following with a mixer just until it is slightly thickening than pour it into the pan. I added marshmallows into mine. they just swirled into marble fudge. they were awesome. Great recipe!",

Boil and mix for around 5 minutes. I don't use candy thermometers but if you find the cold water test not working try just pouring a drop on to a cold work surface. after 1/2 a minute or so it should be softly set. (careful it may be hot.) When the mixture is ready to take off the heat you will find that the candy mass has thickened and reduced in quantity. Another tip is not to beat too long to get the shine out or it will begin to crystalise and taste more grainy. Thanks for a good recipe and all your tips.",

The one hitch I ran in to was that as I cooked the mixture on medium the candy thermometer seemed stuck at about 200 degrees. After about 8 minutes I incresed the heat to medium high (number 7 on my stove) and eventually I hit the requested 235 degrees. The fudge is very tasty and I love the texture and there is either a nutty or a slightly burnt taste to the fudge... I can't decide which. My question for any fudge experts out there is this... should I have just waited (and left the stove set at 5) and the temperature would eventually rise to 235 or was I to increase the temperature once the sugar was added and dissolved and hit 235 as quickly as possible.",
