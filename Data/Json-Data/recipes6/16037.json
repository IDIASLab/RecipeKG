For the crust I used half low-fat graham crackers and half reduced-fat Oreo cookies mixed together while omitting the sugar completely (it's just not necessary). I used reduced-fat peanut butter light cream cheese and halved the confectioner's sugar. If you prefer a more pronounced peanut butter flavor then I would increase to 2 cups or reduce the cream cheese to 8 oz. The filling was delicious although definitely had a noticeable cream cheese flavor. I topped with the remaining graham cracker and Orea mixture. Mini chocolate chips would make a great addition to the pie filling. If you prefer the whipped topping I recommend adding a dash of vanilla extract and 2 tbsp of confectioner's sugar to the final cup of heavy cream; without it the taste is blah. Next time I will make this in an actual pie pan. When I attempted to remove the springform pan the pie nearly caved out the sides. Hope these suggestions help everyone!",
