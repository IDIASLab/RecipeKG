Ingredients like red curry paste, coconut milk and lemongrass are relatively new for both Hubs and me.  As for the fish sauce, this is our second attempt to like it.  The first time we tried it we agreed it smelled bad and it tasted bad too.  This time around it still smelled bad and tasted bad.  Unfortunately, its flavor was predominant, overshadowing the milder flavors of the other ingredients. I believe had I used less of it or eliminated it completely we would have enjoyed this dish much more. Take a chance if you will, but if you want to play it safe leave it out altogether and just add a little salt to compensate.",
