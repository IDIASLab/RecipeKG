After I told my husband about them he asked me to make them when we visited his grandparents. There were a hit there too. My husband raved and raved about them so much that he had one of his co-workers over one night and asked me to make them for him. That's where my one bit of advice comes in. These cook better on a gas stove for some reason.  When I made them for the craft ladies I used a gas stove. When I made them for the grandparents I used a gas stove. But when I made them at home on my electric stove they either came out underdone or overdone. The reason for this is the electric stove cannot keep the temperature of the oil at a consistant temperature (when the dough is dropped in the temperature of the oil cools slightly).  To solve this problem my husband went out and bought me a deep fryer that has a temperature control just so I could make these for him at home. Now, if that's not telling you something about how good these are then I don't know what will. A BIG THANKS for sharing this recipe!\n\nUpdate:  Before you start frying make sure your oil temperature is 375 degrees.",

Best of all they are not too sweet and the honey that you drizzle over them is much healthier than sugar that is used on other treats for kids. Also I would make sure that I am using a teaspoon to measure off the dough before dropping it into the deep fryer. We used a spoon and when they turned golden brown I took them out. Mistake!!! They were not done inside... too big and we had to tear them in halfs and deep fry longer. Otheerwise outstanding.",

I was low on white flour so I used half white/ half wheat. I was also low on oil so I tried heating up 1/4\" in a cast iron skillet and fried the batter that way. It did require a little more awareness and manual turning but it worked out fine. Very fun to make and eat!",
