In it's place I used an 8 oz carton of plain yogurt mixed with enough milk to make 1-1/2 cups and added about 3/4 of a cup of canned pumpkin along with some pumpkin pie spice. I also added a splash of vanilla extract to give it some extra flavor. I made \"mini\" pancakes for my kids to nibble on and got quite a few from one batch. They were very dense and tasted healthy with the bananas and pumpkin mixed in. Thanks a bunch for sharing.",

Then while cooking I add frozen raspberries. They turned out delicious. I've made these twice now and will more than likely make them again!",
