Could deal without pineapple chunks so would recommend crushed if you must have pineapple flavor.

This helped but again would rather not have a chunk//chopped fruit pancake. otherwise it's a fluffy buttermilk pancake.",

Most flavored pancake recipes do call for vanilla and cinnamon--an extract and a spice (of some sort) are pretty standard in flavored pancakes and I don't know why they were omitted here so I'd add them back in. The orange juice was lost in this recipe and I did want to taste it so next time I'd probably add orange zest or extract. Thanks for the recipe we enjoyed these!",
