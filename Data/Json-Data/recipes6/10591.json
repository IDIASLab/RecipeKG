I added the sourcream (with a little extra) and instead of the milk just added some extra buttermilk. It was fantastic....people were asking for the recipe left and right. I put about 3/4 cup of raisins and about 1/2 cup of cranberries. What can I say -- it was better than dessert and I only like chocolate for dessert! WOW!!!",
