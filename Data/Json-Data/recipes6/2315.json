I used organic  all purpose flour.   1/2 cup avocado oil,  1 stick browned butter. reduced the temp to 300 as I used smaller glass bakeware (4) and I noticed they were browning after 20 min. They turned out good and they have some healthy ingredients. So i can feel good about that. would love to reduce the sugar content even know it didn't taste overly sweet. Great way to use up the bananers. Would LOVE to submit a picture but website wont let me.",
