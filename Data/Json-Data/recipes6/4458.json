I also had to cut the pepper garlic sauce and fish sauce because I couldn't find them. I didn't simmer for quite so long because I didn't want the vegetables to get soft. Everything else I kept the same though and WOW! It's a very thin soup but with the rice it's quite filling and sooooo delicious! oh the flavors are just fantastic and we didn't miss the meat at all. It's a fantastic main dish all by itself. The coconut milk is slightly sweet which balances out the peppers and ginger. Absolutely wonderful and I definitely plan to make it again. Edit: stll haven't gotten the garlic sauce but did get some fish sauce. would definitely recommend NOT using the amt listed in the recipe. fish sauce is ridiculously potent and a little goes a long way. 3tbsp is obscene. 1 tbsp is more than enough maybe even too much.",

My first reason is that it is an extremely costly soup to make and didn't have the \"wow\" factor that something so pricey should have had in my opinion. Secondly because I think the ginger overpowered the other ingredients for the most part. I did blend it in batches as the recipe called for but didn't blend what would be considered the last batch and I actually enjoyed it more. The blended dispersed the flavors a little better but the non-blended looked much more appealing and you could taste the individual flavors better. All in all good recipe (blended or not) if you scaled down on the ginger and like coconut based soups so I am giving it a 4.",
