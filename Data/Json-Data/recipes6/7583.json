I drained the ricotta for two days (got busy and left it draining in the fridge longer than planned), but it must have helped because it was not runny when mixed as some others stated.  Left out the almonds, but I didn't miss them.  Great recipe, just be sure to fully drain your ricotta so it's a thicker mixture to pipe into the shells.",

Word of advice, which I forgot...Don't fill the shells with the cream until you are ready to serve.  \n\nI tried to make these ahead of time, put the mixture in a ziploc bag, so I could cut the corner and pipe it in but it looked to good, so I filled the shells.  Made the shells a bit moist.\n\nOh, and one other thing....I had to improvise for the shells, my market didn't have even the frozen shells, so I used the Sugar cones for ice cream in place of the cannoli shells.  \n\nI know the real italians out there would probably run me out of town, but I think I liked them better, It filled the whole shell and was such a subtle difference in taste.  Great Recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I was a little dissapointed with the original recipe. As written it's missing alot of essentials. For example you MUST must must drain your ricotta. If you don't after about 5 minutes it will be a soupy mess. Your ricotta may not look watery but when it sits it melts. Also I added orange zest to give it a bit more flavor. Don't go too crazy just a bit (1/2 tsp) to kick it up. Another thing I did that was REALLY REALLY helpful when I had that soupy mess was add heavy whipping cream (one pint). I whipped it with my hand mixer till it could stand on it's own (careful not to over mix...becomes lumpy) and then blended that into my cannoli filling. It made it very creamy and even now a few days later its still thick. I would recommend adding a bit of vanilla as well (1.5 tsp) but only if your ricotta is drained well. I feel like that's the only thing my cannoli's were missing. I got really amazing shells at Wegmans for about.50 a piece. Alessi Shells...was in the pasta section in my Wegmans for some reason.",
