You can use apricot filling instead of the poppyseed filling and if you don't have the round pans you can bake the rings on regular cookie sheets (just be sure to place the seams of the rings are well sealed and placed downward on the sheets).",

Because we only had one 13.5 ounce can of poppyseed filling (the only one I could find checking several European delis! you can find the finished cakes everywhere here but not apparently the ingredients) we made one roll with that - the can was plenty wouldn't need 21 ounces - and one roll filled with a cinnamon/brown sugar/butter/walnuts mixture.
