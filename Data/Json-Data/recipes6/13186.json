And I've learned to always double the recipe because they will frequently go back for a \"mug of sauce\" and some bread.\n\nMy modifications:\nI saute my onion/garlic in olive oil, then pour in the red wine (merlot) and reduce it down (makes the flavor a little richer and deeper).  Then I pour in the rest of the ingredients (I use  one 28 oz. can of Dei Fratelli Tomato Sauce and one 28 oz. can of Dei Fratelli - Herbs & Olive Oil Chopped Italian Tomatoes plus one 6 oz. can of Contadina tomato paste) except for the meat.  I let it simmer for a few hours.  Then I brown a pound of ground sirloin with 3 cloves of garlic and add to the sauce.  Simmer for another hour, then serve.\n\nI also like to use this as a baked spaghetti sauce.  I layer mixed pasta and sauce in the bottom of a casserole dish, cover with sheets of mozzarella,  more pasta and sauce, and top with mozzarella and grated parmagiana. \n \nDELICIOUS!\n\nThank you for the great recipe!",

Diced tomatoes instead of whole, and ground beef instead of sausage (Hubby prefers). Overall, I love this recipe!",

But tonight I was in the mood for spaghetti, and didn't have any jar sauce, and couldn't get to the store.  So I took a chance and decided one more time to try this homemade sauce. Glad I did. It truly is the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had, better even then what I have had in restaurants. It has a hearty taste and fresh taste. It's kind of hard to describe, it's so good. I did have to make a couple adjustments. I didn't have a can of whole tomatoes, so I used tomato sauce instead, and I only had one can of tomato paste, but that turned out good since the sauce was plenty thick. I had to keep adding water to it as it cooked down, so it wouldn't get too thick. I also had lots more garlic and onions, and a dash of Worstershire sauce. If your a little apprehensive about trying homemade spaghetti sauce, try this one. It is delish!",

To make it lowfat in addition to the onion & garlic just chop up zucchini yellow squash celery and a little bit of green pepper and sautee before adding the spices tomato products and other ingrediets. Leave out the sausage and you've got an amazing lowfat sauce that freezes well and has an awesome taste. In my opinion the red wine is essential as it makes the sauce have a smooth and velvety texture. Delish!",

But after the first bite bf asked me how much sugar was in it bc he thought it was too sweet. I thought it was too spicy and not in a good way. I did make a few changes; used fresh tomatoes (boiled for a minute in water so I could easily peel off the skins) used a bit more garlic than normal and eliminated the sausage but I don't think those changes made the difference between loving it and hating it for me. I love thick sauce and it made it thick so I'm willing to try again but without crushed red pepper or sugar. Neither of us liked those additions. Update: Tried this again again with regular tomatoes I needed to use up. Eliminated the sugar and the crushed red pepper. Like it so much better without those two ingredients! I'll make it that way from now on.",

I added about 1t. of salt and doubled the wine. I will never use any other spaghetti sauce again and next time I will make about 3x the recipe and freeze it in portions.",
