I don't have coffee cans and it would take forever in this house for me to get any (hubs is the only one who drinks it and he doesn't drink that much of it) so I asked for suggestions on the buzz and someone suggested I use a bundt pan so off I went and started to make this recipe. I then realized it called for graham flour not ww flour. I didn't have graham flour but did have ww flour so mentally shrugged and used the ww flour. I added it all to the bundt pan and covered it tightly with 4 pieces of aluminum foil (someone said it might get moister in a bundt pan and I used ww flour which probably has more moister than that graham flour anyway) and happily boiled away for an hour. This bread came out perfectly in that hour. You wouldn't know from the bread itself that I steamed it; it tastes like a sweet (due to the molasses I'm sure) quick bread. It's very good with butter jam or honey. Very fun to try and maybe if I ever end up with a coffee can I'll try it as directed. Thanks for the recipe!",
