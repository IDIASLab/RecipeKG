The dough was a bit moist so I didn't bother rolling out the dough.  Instead, I just divided the dough into eight pieces and pressed them into circles.  I also didn't bother brushing the tops of the scones with the egg yolk.  To me, that just didn't seem necessary.  I will defnintely make these again!!",

I also added a tsp. of vanilla and an additional Tbsp. of sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. These are delicious with currants or raisins and a wonderful base for add-in's like dried cranberries and orange zest or mini chocolate chips. Delicious, light and moist - perfect with a cup of tea!",
