(You know they frown upon you asking for the recipe at the bakery counter!) This one came in at a very close second. This recipe made a wonderfully soft and chewy pumpkin cookie. The only thing was you needed to bake them until they were just done to keep them from overcooking, however, they did not hold a very good shelf life as they were extremely moist and got sticky after a while in the container.",

The bottoms were hard(i make a lot of cookies in my oven) the tops were hard but never browned...didnt really change color. The weirdest part was the stayed in the hard lumps...didnt even flatten down or move when they baked. I really wanted these to turn out...pumpkin cookies sound great.

I had a 28 oz. can of pumpkin that needed using and so I put more (about 2/3 of the can) pumpkin than it calls for I added LOTS of extra spices thanks to reviewers:)(cloves nutmeg EXTRA cinamon ginger) I put another 1/2 cup of oatmeal 1 C extra flour --whole wheat organic flour... to offset the extra pumpkin... another 1/2 cup of butter (so I sort of 1 'ed the recipe) The dough was very wet mushy... so I worried... but within 13 minutes these little cakies were set and done. OH.. don't like raisins so we put in chopped walnuts. These taste like a Starbucks quality Zuchinni muffins with nuts. Very hearty and good. (I also doubled or maybe tripled the Vanilla):) If they were not called \"cookies\" but instead \"Pumpkin Muffin Tops\" I would have given them a 5 star rating. (I was simply expecting something different because of the \"COOKIE\" title) They are very delish though. My kids 10 on down to 3 all love them. Great breakfast treat close to Thanksgiving.",
