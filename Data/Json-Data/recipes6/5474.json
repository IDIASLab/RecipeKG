They have a kick and added a great flavor. I cut the hot pepper sauce (Tabasco) down a little since I was using spicy peppers. I also cut the oil in half since it seemed like too much.

This time I made it exactly as written except for using the recalculating tool to cut the amount down by two thirds. That would be my only gripe - no way will this recipe (as originally written) give 80 people anything but a dollop sized amount.
