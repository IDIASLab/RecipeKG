Unfortunately, I didn't have vanilla sugar, so I had to use vanilla extract. Since I wanted to give the apples some crunch, I tweaked the recipe a little by adding some toasted walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkled the mixture on top of the baked apples. I served it with vanilla ice cream. My whole entire apartment smelled like apples, and this recipe is a keeper!!! :-)",

My boyfriend and I made these apples as a healthier alternative to our usual dessert fare (cookies, or a bit of chocolate) and let me say, it was a HUGE hit!  These apples were perfect- soft on the inside, with just enough crispy on the outside that they weren't mushy.  We used Honeycrisp apples and they added some sweetness to the mix!  They are easy and delicious, and I highly recommend the recipe!\n\nNotes: We made this recipe adjusted for 2 servings, and added a pinch more brown sugar and only 1/8 a tsp of nutmeg since we don't like the taste.",

I sliced 3 apples, tossed them in lemon juice (keeps them from browning and also allows you to use apples that may not be crisp and tart!). I did not do the layering step, I just threw everything together in the bowl. In addition to the brown sugar and cinnamon, I added 2 TBSP melted butter and about half cup of oats. I also put only a PINCH of nutmeg (nutmeg is extremely strong stuff...I can't believe this recipe calls for 1 tsp!). I also used vanilla extract instead of the vanilla sugar. I did not add any extra water as the lemon juice and vanilla extract was plenty. But if it looks too dry to you, by all means add some more water/juice. Baked at 350 for 30 min...voila! It was AMAZING!",
