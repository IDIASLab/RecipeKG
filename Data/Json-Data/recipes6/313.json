I added some green pepper cause I had to use it, in lieu of brown sugar I used 1T white sugar with 1T maple syrup, but otherwise I cooked it as directed. I ate it straight out of the pot without cheese, green onion, or the roll. I will make this again, and again, and again. Maybe it will even make it onto a bun or two ;)",
