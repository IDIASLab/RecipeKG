I liked so much about this recipe \u2013 the addition of blueberries, dicing rather than mashing the bananas and the additions of both nutmeg and cinnamon.  Coating the pan with ground coconut was interesting, however, I didn\u2019t do that as I was using specialty cakelet pans which didn\u2019t make that particularly practical.   While I wouldn\u2019t say the cake is greasy, I do think reducing the oil by 1/4 c. wouldn\u2019t hurt.  This cake is rich, heavy and sweet, so in my view no icing is necessary \u2013 in fact, I would recommend against it.  A simple dusting of powdered sugar is all this needs; although a very runny powdered sugar glaze just to shine it up would be nice too. (Note: My cakelet pans were 6 (one cup) individual molds.  I used two of these pans for one recipe yielding, then, 12 individual cakelets.  I baked them at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes, covered with foil toward the end of baking to prevent overbrowning)",
