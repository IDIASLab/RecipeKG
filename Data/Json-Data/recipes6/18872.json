All I got to say is \"Wonderful!\" This bread isn't like your typical bread though...it came out moist sort of like a cake but it is so good! I added in 1/2 cup extra raisins to the batter cause I love raisins. I only made this bread last night and half of it is gone already! (That's alot considering it's just me and my dad eating!) It's really good with a glass of cold vanilla milk. I'll definitely be using this recipe in the future.",

This bread is delicious and will be good toasted with a little butter on it. I think next time I will use less sugar maybe 3/4 cup instead of the whole cup. This is a must for anyone that loves warm bread right out of the oven and would be great with a cup of hot tea. Very tasty very moist.....5 stars Peggy Ann",

I made the following changes: 1) Used 1 1/4 C of dried mixed fruit bits (apples apricots plums cherries raisins) and chopped dates in place of just the raisins. 2) Added 1/2 C of toasted coarsely chopped almonds. 3) Added 1 teaspoon of cardamom and 1teaspoon of ground ginger. 4) Baked it for 65 minutes. Just after taking the bread out of the oven I loosened the bread from the pan and wrapped it in many layers of aluminum foil (in order to keep the moisture in). Tastes dense and cake-like and is even better the next day. Yummy! I am definitely going to make this many more times.",
