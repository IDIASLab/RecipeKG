Yes these are definitely more cake like than your traditional brownies (that's why they're not called brownies) and no I don't think they're super chocolaty but they are still chocolate. I was surprised by other reviewers that said the sour cream made the dessert \"tangy\". I've never thought that these were tangy. Similar to another reviewer I always add an egg to the cream cheese mixture and we also melt 1.5 oz of unsweetened baking chocolate squares instead of the cocoa powder.",
