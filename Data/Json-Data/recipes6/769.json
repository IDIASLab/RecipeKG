Cut apples small and coat with squeezes of fresh lemon juice, which adds a lovely touch to the flavor.  I agree w/ another reviewer here who said this recipe is too sweet!  Half the brown sugar - I used 3/4 cup for a double recipe & it was still sweeter than I would have wanted for breakfast.  I used sour cream plus a fatty plain Greek yogurt (Fage), adding a bit more vanilla.  Delicious.  Recommend the granny smith apples as the recipe indicates. I forewent the crumble & dusted with powdered sugar instead.",

I used sucanat instead of sugar and gala apples instead of granny smith, tossing them with the juice from 1/2 lemon before adding to the batter. A word of caution: don't over mix the dough as that can lead to a tough texture; mix the dry ingredients well, mix the wet ingredients well, and then gently mix the whole thing just until everything is incorporated. Thanks for this great recipe, the kids are already asking me to make it again!",

It takes about an hour to bake with all the extra moisture. My three year old loves to help and it is always a hit. This is a simple recipe that is really great!
