Added bell peppers and onions as suggested, and used ground turkey and a 15 oz. can of sloppy joe mix in place of the packet if mix and tomato sauce. Wasn't sure about the cottage cheese but I remembered my mom used cottage cheese in her spaghetti casserole, so I gave it a whirl. I actually couldn't taste it much, but I think it made the dish a bit soupy. I recalled later that my mom used to strain the cottage cheese, so I will have to do that next time. Thank you for the great recipe!",
