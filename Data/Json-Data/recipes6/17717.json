The first time I made them with the fresh cranberries and it was a lot of work and the cookie did not have the sweetness I was hoping for.  The second time I made these cookies I substituted orange flavored Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) for the fresh cranberries.  After I did that I got rave reviews on the cookies.  They are now my mother-in-law\u2019s favorite cookie. After the cranberry change I would give this cookie recipe 5 stars.",

I changed a few things though: I wanted a stronger orange taste so I doubled the orange juice (and adjusted the amount of flour accordingly) and quadrupled the orange zest. I used fresh cranberries that I half-mashed but used a bit less than a cup. I also added extra nutmeg and some clove. I baked the cookies a bit longer (about 10-12 minutes) and they came out chewy but not limp. Thank you for this recipe!",

I was a little worried after reading the reviews but loved all the ingredients. Only a few very minor changes I made...I added a 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1 cup of nuts. I used the food processor to cut up the fresh cranberries. Then I chilled the dough about a half hour before baking. I think this cookie also turns out much better when you make the cookies small. You could place the batter in a greased jelly roll pan and bake 20-25 minutes and they would come out very good. It is a nice healthy great tasting contrast to the many rich candies and baked goods we get this time of year.",

Cookies weren't very sweet could probably use a little more sugar but were very delicious. Made an orange frosting with 2 tbsp. orange juice 1 cup of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp. give or take of orange zest. This frosting gave them the sweetness I was looking for.
