What I used was the ginger paste in a tube that you can find in the produce department at the supermarket, and it worked great.  Particularly loved the sauce, and I could see with a little addition of cornstarch, it would make a great sauce for stir fried veggies, as well.  Super quick and easy to make, as well as tasty, and I\u2019m sure it would be equally good using pork.  Winner recipe!",
