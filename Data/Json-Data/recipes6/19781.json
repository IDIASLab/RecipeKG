It is good but I was disappointed that the cake itself did not have a stronger hazelnut presence. If you were to add more Frangelico liqueur the cake would be too sweet. I did place a small amount of batter in the tins before adding the candies. Next time I would simply fill the tins and push the candies into the batter. Thanks for sharing!",
