I only made a half recipe so that was 3 ice cubes (frozen coffee cubes), 1 cup milk - and i used 2T chocolate and 2T caramel syrup plus 2T sugar.  It was still very sweet so next time I'll omit the sugar and just add a little at a time to taste.  It is a little runny for my taste so I added 4 regular ice cubes to help make it more frosty.  This recipe is very easy and can easily be adapted to make all the specialty flavors for frozen coffees (peppermint, oreo, etc.) - just watch the sweetness.  I also double-brewed my coffee (made it regular then ran the brewed coffee thru the machine again like it was water with the same grounds as the first time) to make it more intese and used decalf (all I had on hand).  YUMMY!",

I give it 4 stars only because I think you should sweeten this (and all iced coffee drinks) with simple syrup instead of sugar.  Sugar doesn't dissolve completely and leaves granules.  Simple syrup is simply 1 part water and 1 part sugar.  Boil together till sugar dissolves, cool.  You can store this in your refrigerator for weeks.  (I work for a coffee company.  ;-)",
