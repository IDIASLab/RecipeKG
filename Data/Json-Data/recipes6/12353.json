First make sure you've sifted the flour really well before using.  Second, keep an eye on the egg whites and don't over-whip them.  Third, GENTLY fold the egg yolks into the whites.  Again, don't over whip!  Finally, place a cookie cutter on the parchment paper or silpat and pipe the mixture into the cookie cutter until it's about halfway full.  Lift the cookie cutter up and move it approximately 1 inch away and repeat.  You end up with nice round absorbent ladyfingers that are perfect for tiramisu.  Hope this helps!",

However, I saved a little batter in the fridge; I piped and baked a few fingers the next day and VOILA! Poofy and cakey, as they should be. So if you notice a first panful goes flat, try cooling the batter and trying again later.",

They are very light and airy! I didn't have a problem with them spreading too much like others did. Although I can say that they are kind of a thinner cookie which worked well for my Tiramisu. I'm still not sure about the Tiramisu but the cookies rocked! I got 38 cookies from this recipe it may vary for others as I \"piped\" them through a plastic bag and I wasn't very good at getting them all the same size. I did cook them for 7 minutes instead of 8. I found that the bottoms were nice and brown and the tops were very light. My husband ate like 12 of them with a tall glass of milk before I made my tiramisu! I will definitely use this recipe again and again!",
