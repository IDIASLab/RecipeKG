I used two bags of Fritos scoops and pick out the nicely shaped ones -- place them rounded side down on two wax-paper covered jelly roll pans -- put the rest of the \"not so perfect ones\" on a third covered sheet. Bring the sugar/corn syrup to a full roiling boil but then immediately remove from the heat and add the peanut butter and stir til smooth -- drizzle over the scoops filling each little cup. Move fairly quickly so the caramel doesn't set up. Pour the rest of the mixture over the \"not so pretty\" pan. Let them cool. Melt 6 oz chocolate chips in a baggie - snip a corner and drizzle over the perfect chips. You will need some more chocolate if you want to put chocolate on the \"not so perfect\" pan. Chill (fridge or freezer) for a few minutes and they will snap apart. The perfect scoops will be quite attractive and the \"not so perfect\" pan becomes the cook's treat. The bride was ALMOST sorry she had a \"regular\" wedding cake -- \"Coulda just gone with the Fruckies\";-)",

Nobody wanted the Fritos so I took all of them home with this recipe in mind. I only had eight 1-ounce bags so I was a little short on the required amount but I went ahead with the recipe as written otherwise using a 9 x 13 inch pan. As some other reviewers mentioned doing I crushed the Fritos slightly before putting them into the pan. The salty and sweet flavors of this dessert go really well together and the peanut butter in the sugar/corn syrup mixture keeps it from being so sweet your fillings hurt. I did feel that the 2-1/2 ounces of Fritos I was short on were really needed because the peanut butter layer was a bit thick compared to the amount of Fritos so next time I'll be sure to have the full amount the recipe calls for. I didn't use chocolate bars because 11 of them would have cost me almost 10! Instead I used a 12-ounce bag of chocolate chips. We all agreed that the semi-sweet chocolate chips were perfect and that milk chocolate would have been too sweet.",

My latest incarnation includes shredded coconut and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Something about the latter two ingredients brings in a MOUNDS-type quality to these cookie bars. I do sometimes use the \"Scoop\" Fritos to make neat hand held pieces but you don't get the chewiness factor that comes from layers of Fritos coming into contact with hot peanut butter caramely goodness! What I love most about this recipe is the 1:1 ratio of the drizzle so that when I have cravings I can make just a small plate of Fruckies.",
