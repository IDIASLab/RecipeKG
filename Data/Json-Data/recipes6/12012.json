A tip for people who find the cookies too crumbly or too gooey it's very important that you only let the wet ingredients boil for one minute (minute starts when it comes to a boil) and wait a bit before adding the dry ingredients. Move the wet ingredients off the burner and let it simmer down until it's no longer bubbling add the ingredients then and you should get well set cookies. If you wait too long they will turn to powder before you can get them into drop cookies!",

Also stir together the sugar and cocoa before adding the wet ingredients, this allows the cocoa to mix better.",

Once I mixed in the dry ingredients I added semi-chocolate chips. But as you might have imagined the sugar/milk was so warm the chips melted immediately. HAHAH.. but the cookies were great nonetheless. I also tried adding a few drops of coconut flavoring in the 'dough' for a few cookies for those of us who like coconut flavor but hate the texture! Overall great and easy to make cookie that you can experiment with.",
