I only baked them for 18 minutes. Thanks for a winner!",

The flavor of these muffins was OK--could have benefitted from the addition of vanilla and maybe a little spice in the batter--but the amount of blueberries was too much for the small amount of batter. I wouldn't recommend making larger muffins like I did (I made eight) because they were too moist and turned out more like a blueberry cobbler in spite of baking for 30 minutes.",

I didn't read all the reviews until they were happily in the oven and I was a bit freaked out and was a worried I had picked the wrong recipe. I even made extra crumbles but they came out delicious! I cut them in 1/2 warm and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and they were to die for! Will make again and again!",
