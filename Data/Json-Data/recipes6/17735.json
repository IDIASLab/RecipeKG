But it was soooo good. A little dry maybe b/c I used reduced fat busquick? Also wasn't firm enough to knead maybe for the same reason. However I put it in my cool scone pan baked it then sliced them in half and filled with....NUTELLA! Fantastic! thank you!",

Super quick super easy. I like them because they're not sickeningly sweet and low fat. They have just a hint of sweetness. Served with whipped cream they're perfect! I agree though with the previous reviewer - it's not a pretty presentation by itself. They'd be really good with a drizzle of caramel too. Yum!",
