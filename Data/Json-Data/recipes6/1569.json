The caramel popcorn is so light and basically melts in your mouth like cotton candy.  I keep the broken up chunks in the freezer until I\u2019m ready to serve them because it keeps everything crisp, crunchy, and delicious. I think this is the problem a different reviewer had who said it was chewy. Just follow the recipe exactly, keep it in an airtight container in the freezer, and it\u2019s one of the most amazing snacks you\u2019ll have for the holidays.",
