                "reviewBody": "2.27.20  First, I followed this recipe to the letter, and overall, I was pretty happy with the way it turned out.  I\u2019m not on the keto diet, but I am trying to pay more attention to my daily carb intake.  If you have any cheesecloth use it (I certainly will next time).  I can now see the importance of getting as much water out of the cauliflower as possible and cheesecloth will help with that. Your arms and hands will get a workout from squeezing the cauliflower.  My crust really didn\u2019t crisp up as I had hoped, but that well may have been that I had too much water left in the cauliflower.  The instructions don\u2019t say to place parchment paper on the baking pan, but I did spritz my pizza pan with some olive oil, and it still stuck a bit.  I worked on it, and I eventually was able to flip it, at which time I put it back into the oven for several minutes hoping to crisp it up a bit. Not sure what the paprika was supposed to do, but I\u2019ll cut that back next time and probably add some dried basil and garlic powder, try parchment paper, and try cooking for 25 minutes.   I made a mediterranean style pizza with a base of tomato sauce topped with red onion, pepperoncini peppers, bell pepper, sliced olives, feta cheese, and parsley.  This was a little time consuming, but you\u2019ll save a lot of $$$ in comparison to buying one of the frozen crusts such as Caulipower\u00ae.  We liked it, I do think it can be improved a little, and I will make again.",
