I had a ruined pie crust/dough and needed to disguise it and voila! A delicious find. This pie was enjoyed by everyone who tried it this morning. A girl who loves apple pie and who I actually made it for said \"This is the best apple pie! Ever!\" I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I used another recipe for the pie crusts; pre-cooked the thinly sliced(1/8\") Granny Smith apples and the ingredients for 15 mins over med/low heat and then cooled. Tasted it for its sweetness and sprinkled another 1/4c. brown sugar. I generally drain the filling so it's not runny/slimey which I find so prevalent in many pies. It's a process but I will make it again for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing cmsassman!",
