One suggestion to make is after the dough has kneaded in the machine cut off about 100 ml. of dough for the 2 pound machine to ensure it doesn't rise past the lid and adversely affect the baking of the centre top. The bread was moist flavourful and texture was great. I like this recipe even better than regular raisin bread as it was more moist and flavourful.",

I only gave it the one rise as a whole lump of dough before separating it into the loaf tins and it worked fine. I also substituted 3 cups of whole wheat flour for the white. Lovely fragrant bread was the result with great texture. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone as it is easy to make and produces excellent results. One thing... the instructions skip the step where you add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients! Not that hard to figure out but just a wee glitch I noticed.",

I think it helped that I added extra spices to this--about 1/4 t. extra cloves and nutmeg too. I also added 2 T. gluten because I made this with half whole wheat flour. I squeezed the excess water out of my carrots because I worried that the extra moisture might throw the wet/dry balance off. I don't know whether it would have or not but the bread turned out plenty moist and really tasty.",
