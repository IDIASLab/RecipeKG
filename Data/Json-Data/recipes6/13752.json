                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe!  As a child growing up, my mom made pickled eggs and beets each year as part of our Easter tradition.  I always looked forward to them, and I wanted to find a recipe that matched the way I remember them tasting.  This one did the trick!  I have a large glass gallon pickle jar that I wanted to fill, so I actually used 20 hard-boiled eggs, and I quadrupled (yes, four times as much) the rest of the ingredients.  I used 4 cans of regular (not pickled) whole beets, which gave me 4 cups of juice.  To the juice I added 4 cups of sugar, 3 cups of vinegar, 2 tsps. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 8 bay leaves, and 48 whole cloves (they're small!).  (As for the onion, I used one extra-large onion, cut it in half, and sliced it into thin half-rings.)  It sounds like a lot, but it made just enough liquid to pour over the eggs, onions and beets in the jar, with just a little left over.  I made two layers each of the three items in the jar--first beets, then onions, then eggs.  I recommend allowing them to refrigerate at least 3 to 4 days.  I made them on Saturday afternoon (3/15), and this morning, Wednesday (3/19), they finally taste like they've developed the full pickled flavor.  Yummy!  Thanks, Cindy, for helping me to recall some fond childhood memories. ",

For 6-7 eggs I simmer only 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cider vinegar with the juice from 1 16oz jar of pickled beets and it tastes exactly like the ones my Pennsylvania Dutch Grandma made and is much easier.  Don't forget to stir or shake once or twice a day for even color.  48 hrs is a minimum, will usually take four days to be colored through.",

My mother used to go one step further, with the leftover beets and pickled eggs - she made 'Beet Salad' - similar to making potato salad, but use beets in place of potatoes. Dice the beets, dice the eggs, chop some celery and onion (if you like both or either) and mix with mayonaisse. The color is amazing as the mayo takes on a beautiful pink color - and the taste is something you'll love forever. Its too bad people have this fear or hatred towards beets - they are the best thing out there! Try the beet salad, you'll love it.",
