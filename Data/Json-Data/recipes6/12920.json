They're nicely, uniformly  shaped and come out of the oven just as you always cross your fingers and hope they will when you try a new cookie recipe. I was tempted to add some coconut extract and am glad I didn't.  I did add chocolate-covered, candy-coated sunflower seeds and wish I hadn't. They sure dressed up the cookie but I think they would have been better without.  No nit-picking allowed on this recipe like \"more of this or less of that.\"  This recipe has \"perfect\" down pat.",
