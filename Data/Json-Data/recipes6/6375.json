I used previously frozen (and thawed) pizza dough (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site).  We always keep shredded grilled chicken in the freezer, so I was able to simply heat the butter/Red Hot/chicken and eliminate the boil.  Operating on rote, I sprayed and cornmealed the pan before spreading the dough (and liked the texture it added).  After spreading the chicken over the base cheese, I squirted a bit of light ranch dressing, followed by the final cheese.  I used Kraft's \"Pizza Blend\" shredded cheese, w/a bit of shredded white cheddar, too.  This baked 20 minutes in our over, followed by a few minutes under broil to brown the top.  Our one complaint, if you will, is it was quite salty (and I love salt).  I'll search for a low sodium hot sauce to use next time.  THANKS for the recipe!",

I baked the chicken the day ahead and reheated on the stove top with the butter and buffalo sauce. We like celery with our buffalo dishes, so I made half the calzone as written and the other half I added diced celery to the chicken mixture.   When I make this again, I will add celery to all of it.  This is very filling and lasted us for 2 dinners with enough leftover for DH lunch.  Great recipe that I will make again.  Served 'Broccoli and Cauliflower Salad' from AR with it.",

I cooked six small red potatoes quartered in a pot and smashed them with a little more Frank's probably another quarter cup. They soaked it right up. It was actually a little too much so I have some lunch tomorrow! I made two calzones dividing the store bought Publix dough in two. I followed the chicken measurements and Franks. I rolled two mini circles keeping a little mound of flour nearby to pat my palms into. I spread out the chicken mixture. I added a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese on each. Then added the mozzarella cheese and then patted some smashed potatoes on top. I put each on a large cookie sheet covered in parchment sprinkled with yellow cornmeal. I set the two sealed calzones on it and baked them in my convection oven on 420 for 20 minutes. Oh I also had sliced tomatoes and basil that I put on top of each after I rubbed them with olive oil. So it took a little longer to bake because of the potatoes. I will definitely do this one again!",

I add 1/4 block cream cheese to the chicken/buffalo sauce mixture makes the calzone a bit creamier and I prefer it that way! I don't put the mixture over the entire dough just half and fold the dough over top. I have tried this using dough from a bakery that was frozen and the pre rolled dough from the dairy section. Don't use the pre rolled dough from the dairy section of your grocery store it sucks. Use the real stuff from the bakery department you can find in the frozen aisle or sometimes in the bakery dept cooler. Or make your own (I'm not doing that). One of these calzones is enough to feed 2 people with massive appetites. Could feed 3 maybe even 4 if you're feeding small kids! Great recipe cook all the time now!",
