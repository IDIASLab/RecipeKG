My frosting was very runny after it sat for several hours (not on the cakes). I would recommend frosting and refrigerating the cake immediately after the frosting is made. I think the consistency of the frosting and the slickness of the jam add to the stability issues. The frosting is very tasty. I used cherry jam but would use strawberry next time. The cake flavor itself was average. Also I don't get how this recipe is low-fat other than the frosting.",
