NOTE: You absolutely have to simmer this for 3-4 hours minimum. I tried a taste after about an hour and was disappointed. I waited four hours later and was blown away by how much difference the simmering made. A definite winner!!",

The recipe makes a delicious sauce without many changes. I usually add meatballs when it's nearly done and omit the sausage. Sometimes I increase the ceyenne pepper for more of a bite. I've added fresh mushrooms black olives and fresh tomatoes. They all work well. Also it REALLY benefits from a long simmer: I simmer it on very low heat for up to three hours and the flavor is drastically improved. Excellent recipe. But give it time to cook!!",

I added 1/2 cup of red wine a can of tomato paste and I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 4 cans of tomato sauce vs. the opposite. It's the best consistency and flavor ever! Thanks. It's a keeper.",
