I replaced the oil with applesauce (made no difference in taste and of course, it's healthier) and only used choc. chips in the one loaf.  Also, my oven time was 60 min. and they came out perfect.  It was the first time I'd used zucchini so I enjoyed the new experience......our garden is (as most gardeners who grow the veggie) being overrun by the things!  Happy baking!!",

The recipe is not specific about how to 'prepare pans'. Buttering and flouring seems to work best for me. Just buttering or oiling doesn't allow the cake to fall out of the pan. I love this one with added vanilla and lemon zest - not crazy about the chocolate chips.",

Based on some of the other reviews I cup the sugar down by 1/2 a cup. I still felt it was too sweet (and I generally like sweet things!) So I agree with a some of the other reviewers to cut the sweetener down. This next batch I cut it to 1 cup sugar & 1/4 cup maple syrup... it's much better. Also I found that the bake time was a lot shorter than the recipe called for... my stove has a thermometer in it so I can't explain why I only needed to bake it for about 40-45 minutes? I'll keep this one as a favorite!",
