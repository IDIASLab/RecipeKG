But I am wondering if anyone can tell me why about half of the batches didn't set they are ice cream topping consistency?? The first time I didn't do a single batch so I thought maybe that was why.. but I did ALL the rest one by one canning them in water bath for 15 minutes and then each time starting the process completely over. I have a flat top stove so it is REALLY hard to keep the temperature perfect - especially if you are using more than one burner - the whole thing is just hot! I cleaned/cut bad spots from tomatoes put them in the blender (skin seeds & all) then cooked them with the sugar for 20 minutes then added the jello & then did the canning process. Any suggestions? I used Jello brand jello - the regular/original kind. Strawberry & Raspberry flavors. I'm still excited none the less just wondering if anyone has some helpful hints! I wasn't exactly sure how to get tomato pulp - was putting them in the blender right or wrong? Please & thank you for any and all helpful pieces of advice!:)",

The kids are not very picky when it comes to anything sweet so they really enjoyed the jam not to say that it isn't good because it is remarkeably tasty but obviously it is what it is-not the real thing(can anything beat homemade raspberry/strawberry jam with chunks of fruit?). I did fool a lot of people who thought that it was authentic. I cut the sugar by LESS than half and it was still very sweet. I have tried this with every variety of gelatin and the berries are the best in my opinion. I sometimes throw in a hand of sliced real berries to give even more of an effect. I will be using this recipe again! Thanks!",
