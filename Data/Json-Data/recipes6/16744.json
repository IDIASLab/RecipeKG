The way the recipe is they come out to be nuts clumps in the midst of a pile of praline \"cookie.\" I prefer the traditionaly southern pralines where it is a nut that is coated in a dry praline coating so I upped the quantity of pecans to 2 cups. I also added 1/4 c. real rum and about a tablespoon of dried ground ginger to the cinnamon/vanilla mixture. For the higher quantity of pecans you have to move quickly as the praline mixture will cool quickly and begin to solidify around each nut very quickly. Just keep stirring which will break apart huge clusters then spread on a baking sheet until cool. Then I pour them into a collander and toss all the loose sugar off. This also rounds the edges of the praline coating out on the nuts. Even better is that you can save the sugar that falls out of the collander and use as brown sugar in cookies! So delicious...",

(Total cook time is about 15 minutes) Let cool until temperature is about 150 degrees. Stir until it begins to hold its shape, but not too stiff. Spoon onto waxed paper and let cool. If mixture becomes too stiff to spoon out, simply reheat it a little.  If you have trouble in higher altitudes, try adding an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of evaporated milk. Good luck! They are wonderful!",
