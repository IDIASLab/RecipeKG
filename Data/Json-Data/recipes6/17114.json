I have made them as lime cokoies but also made a lemon icing and used lemon/lime peel in the dough for an extra kick. When my husband was deployed to the desert I sent him these they traveled great! It took about two weeks to reach him but they maintained their chewy softness. And the men LOVED them. Thanks for the recipe.",
