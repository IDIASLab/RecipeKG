I put 6 tablespoons of the sauce in the ground beef after is was cooked and cooled a little. Lime juice gets bitter if you heat it too much. For the sauce the only change I made was I added and extra teaspoon of Sriracha per recipe. I doubled the entire sauce recipe because we like extra. I added thinly sliced red onion and cucumbers to the salad. Tasted just like the restaurant dish!",
