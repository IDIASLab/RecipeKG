She was famous for her whoopie pies. If you are having trouble with it here is how I do it and mine come out great. Use a good hand mixer to beat everything. Sift your dry ingredients beat the sugar shortening and eggs thoroughly and add in the dry ingredients and boiling water alternately in at least four batches beating thoroughly after each addition - this means beating at least two minutes with a mixer nine or ten separate times. If this isn't done the dough will be lumpy. Put it on a baking sheet in small amounts: I use a heaping teaspoon for mine. That will make a pie that is the size of an english muffin. Don't grease the sheet or the edges will be crispy. Use a metal spatula to carefully scrape them off the sheet. Scrape the sheet between batches. Take them off the sheet to cool as soon as they come out of the oven. For the filling beating is again the key. I use a small wire whisk for beating and cooking the milk and flour. I hold the pan on its edge over the heat and beat the milk and flour the entire time I'm cooking. When finished it's the consistency of pudding. If you go thicker or don't beat it your filling will be lumpy. Cool it on the stove until it's not warm enough to melt the shortening. Don't chill it in the fridge. If you make it while you're baking",
