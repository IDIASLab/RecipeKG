First, I didn\u2019t have Franks, so I used a mix of mostly Tabasco and a little Cholula. Tobasco must be A LOT hotter, because the cauliflower florets were hot hot hot. I ate them with carrots, celery, and ranch dip; as dinner, the recipe is more like two or three servings.  I cooked them at 400 but will try 375 next time \u2014 they browned a lot, and I cooked them for 10-15 mins less time than suggested.  I\u2019ll try them next time with Franks and cut the florets larger. I didn\u2019t think the cheese was necessary, especially if you serve them with ranch or blue cheese dip.",

When cutting the cauliflower be sure to get the stem along with the florets so that the chunks don t fall apart. If you just get flowers then they break apart in the batter or crumbs and you end up with tiny Buffalo nibbles not worth the effort. I did not toss them in the BBQ sauce because I was worried that the batter/ crumb mixture would fall off. It s sturdier than I thought I think it would be fine. I ll do it next time. I just brushed the sauce over them. Still yum! I ran out of steam after the cauliflower so for a dip I used Veganaise and dill and garlic. Thick but good. Ranch would be perfect but I didn t have any.",
