I made a few small changes: chopped green leaf lettuce instead of romaine, roasted pecans instead of cashews, at least twice as much apple and pear and about 2 TBS less sugar. I wanted to have everything ready about an hour before it was time to toss everything together so I tossed the sliced apples and pears with some of the dressing. Besides staying nice and white they absorbed some of the wonderful dressing flavor. We enjoyed the Swiss cheese, but I want to try this with blue cheese next time. I think the sweetness of the dressing and the saltiness of the blue cheese would be perfect. 12/2004\nUpdate 9/2007: I finally made this using blue cheese and I love it! My husband and I both liked it much better than the swiss cheese and this is the only way I will make it from now on. ",

To save time, I will often use bottled lemon poppyseed dressing and prewashed organic greens. I also use what ever nuts I have on hand but I like slivered (not sliced) almonds the best.

My modifications: (a) I doubled the recipe but instead of using 2 heads of romaine lettuce I used one head of romaine and 1 bag of spinach. (b)Omitted the Swiss cheese. (c) Instead of cashews I added toasted pecans (toasted myself). Nuts such as pecans and walnuts seem to match the fruit and season better. (d) I added some dried cherries along with the dried cranberries. (d)Despite having doubled the salad I only needed half as much dressing because the dressing was on the side.\r\n\r\nHaving the dressing on the side worked great. I used less, the salad didn't get soggy and the leftovers kept better. The leftovers were actually minimal. I made a huge bowl. Since the original recipes makes 12 - 1 cup servings, I made roughly 24 cups. At the end of the evening the rest fit tightly in a 3-cup Ziplock plastic storage container.\r\n",

I used pecans as that was what I had and thought they worked fine.  A very, very good sald with another choice of greens.",
