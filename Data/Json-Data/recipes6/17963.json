The trick is to first let them ripen until the SKINS's all black and getting moldy. Yes, it sounds gross, but this lets the starches break down & makes the plaintains extra sweet! They're perfect with just some black beans and sour cream, but throw in some fried eggs and it's the best breakfast ever!",

So I went on a search for something out of the ordinary and found this.  Everyone loved it!  I was surprised at how easy it was to work with the mashed plantain, I thought it would be too sticky but it wasn't.  I didn't have any refried black beans so I used a can of black beans, drained most of the liquid and mashed them.  Instead of sour cream I used \"media crema\" (table cream) that you can find in the Mexican aisle of most major grocery stores.  I used platanos maduros and didn't try the cinnamon as another reviewer suggested but I might next time.  I will definitely make this again.  \u00a1Gracias por compartir esta receta tan buena!",

It won't necessarily be bad but it is a totally different dish altogether because plantains change in texture and flavor when they ripen.\n\nIf you use green, these will be more like a potato dumpling filled with beans and will favor a savory taste.\n\nIf you use ripe plantains these will be softer and have a sweet taste, similar to a sweet potato fritter (slightly sweeter depending on the ripeness level of the plantains). \n\nI am using the potato/sweet potato analogy to give you an idea of the sweetness, not because the taste is the same.",
