I didn't want it too soft or to hard. I used two large buttered metal cookie sheets. Split the mixture between the two. I waited only until the candy was cool enough to touch (maybe 5 minutes) then i started stretching. I made cherry and the candy went from a dark red to a light pink by the time I was done stretching. I don't think it would have turned out nearly as good had I not stretched it so much. Also make sure you have two people to stretch. By the time I got to the second pan it was already setting up. It still worked but was much harder on my arms! I may add two kool aid packets next time. My husband loves it. Also I did NOT butter my hands before stretching. There was no need. It only stuck to itself. There was enough butter from the pan I guess. I didn't want the candy to be butter flavored or coated in butter.",

I had a hard time getting any of our burners to heat the mixture over 225 degrees so I had to partially cover the mixture. We took it out right when the thermometer hit 250 and added 2 packs of grape kool aid. We let it cool and it was still very soft. My kids and I butter our hands and tried to \"pull\" the taffy but it wasn't exactly what we had in mind. It was very sticky and even after 30 minutes of pulling it never really firmed up. We ended up having to put this on wax paper in big globs and smash it down like laffy taffy. We had a blast making this and even though it was very messy and didn't turn out like we had hoped for the flavor was good and it was a lot of fun to make with the kids.",
