                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe. Very easy and the rolls come out just like my mom used to make. To get the bread dough to rise properly, I take one loaf from the freezer, put it in an 8x8 or large pie pan, rub a little butter on top and cover with plastic wrap. This allows it to rise without getting those hard spots. When it has thawed and risen, I take it out and roll it into a rectangle, then add the filling. After cutting and putting the rolls back in the pan, I cover it again and let them rise until cooking (at least a couple hours, sometimes overnight). I have never tried to get two pans from one bread loaf as the recipe says. Seems to me they'd be very small.  Oh, and before putting the rolls in the pan, sprinkle more brown sugar and a little butter. This gives the rolls that nice, sticky bottom.",

I thawed the frozen dough overnight in the fridge in bread pans.  Make sure to spray the pans and plastic wrap covers.  Then, I took them out and let them rise for 1.5 hours.  I covered a silicone cookie sheet on the counter and shook some flour on it and the rolling pin, rolled it out to fit the silicone, then used the silicone to help me roll it up.  I used dental floss to cut them into 2-3 inch rolls, putting them into a buttered baking dish with a little space between each.  I covered them back up, and let them rise for another 1.5 hours.  \n\n2.  I almost forgot the cream!  I put them in, after 10 minutes let out a shriek, poured it over, continued cooking.  What I didn't know was the cream makes a kind of caramel when it cooks with the cinnamon/butter/sugar in the rolls dripping.  DELICIOUS!!\n\n3.  I took the first pan out too soon, because the tops were brown, but the whole centers collapsed!  We ate them anyway...lol.  Second batch, I covered with foil and gave them an extra 10 minutes.  PERFECT.\n\nSo, delicious, easy, best ever cinnamon rolls.",
