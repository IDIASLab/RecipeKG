So I hope the following helps others who need to do the same: scaling this down to 16 servings resulted in 12 perfectly shaped and sized muffins. An 8-oz. can of crushed pineapple and one small to medium sized zucchini worked well. Hubs keeps telling me he likes neither muffins nor quick breads yet he always seems to like what I bake including these he had two AFTER supper. Pleasantly sweet not heavily spiced with a tender light moist crumb that s cake-like in texture. Just a nice breakfast type muffin to accompany a cup of coffee or tea. These would have been fine as is but I did give them a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar just cuz. For those who really have to have their muffins sweeter a simple glaze of powdered sugar and the drained pineapple juice would be awesome good!",
