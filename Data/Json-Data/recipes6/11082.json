WE ARRIVED RIGHT AS THEY WERE FINISHING DINNER SO I HAD A PIECE OF LEFTOVER CAKE WTIH THEM. NOT ONLY DID I FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS I LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON.... THIS CAKE IS 100 X'S BETTER IF ALLOWED TO SET FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS (OR MORE!) AND PREPARED AS IS (NO MODS NECESSARY)!!! I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT TRUST ME A NIGHT IN THE FRIDGE IS KEY.:) Not bad. My hubs and I treated my parents to a belated father's day dinner out. I made this cake to cap off our hearty Italian meal. Although I liked this (my hubs not so much - he isn't fond of any dessert other than chcolate cake lol) my parents were MUCH bigger fans that I was. I think I would have enjoyed this quite a bit more WITHOUT the pudding and if the pineapple were mixed in with the whipped topping. Don't get me wrong.... This was good it was just a smidgin over the top for me. NOTE #1: Instead of making a syrup out of pineapple and sugar just warm up a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple in heavy syrup (it's pretty much the same thing and involves less work!). NOTE #2: It is perfectly fine to substitute prepared Cool-Whip rather than making your own. Yes homemade is prolly better but it's OK to cheat (and no one will know the difference). Thanks for sharing your recipe Star. Since my parents really enjoyed this so they will be eating the leftovers all week.:-)",
