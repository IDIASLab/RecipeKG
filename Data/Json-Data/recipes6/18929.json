After struggling with 2 butter knives to make the topping, I just used my hands to toss it together lightly, and it came out fine. Also, I chopped the apples into small pieces instead of slicing them and used paper liners. It was very easy to remove the muffins from the liners. Highly recommended! =)",

You could easily substitute raisins for the walnuts in this recipe which is really nice. For the topping I used brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. of flour and 2 Tbsp. of quick cooking oats. These baked up beautifully, but for some reason I got a bit more than 6 - oh well more to eat!",

After reading reviews I used 1 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar used a little more than 2 cups apples and made smaller slices to have more apples per muffin and added a little nutmeg to the batter as well. We don't care for nuts so I omitted them. I also made my own crumb topping; 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup flour 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup butter. This topping generously covered 18 regular muffins which this recipe yielded for me. Will definetly make this recipe again.",
