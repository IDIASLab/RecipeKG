There was a small amount of space left at the top which I would stuff with parchment or wax paper so the ingredients don't shift. I think these would make great gifts and are a pretty quick mix to whip up. I used a sheet of parchment paper as a funnel to fill the jar. I used real butter in these. I weighed the dough out to 1.5oz per ball and got 17 cookies. My cookies did spread thin on the baking sheet even though I chilled the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes on the first batch and 30 minutes on the second batch. Next time I might try a longer chill time to see if that would help. I would recommend several inches between each cookie when baking if you don't want them all ran together. These are a super buttery crisp cookie! I would make these again and would not hesitate to gift!",
