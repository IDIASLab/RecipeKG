I wish an actual measurement in cups was used for the apples because they can vary widely in size. Mine were softball sized. I left the peel on. I was excited to try this recipe as apple crisp is DH's favorite dessert. He wasn't overly impressed. I think the main complaint was that there was no liquid or \"goop\" in the bottom. Overall this is very dry. We'll finish this batch but I doubt that I'll make it again.",
