I read through the reviews and most complained of them not being \"spicy\", but they used the chili powder or chili sauce - the kind you find in the grocery store next to the ketchup which isn't really spicy at all.  I'm not sure, but based on the recipe title and the list of ingredients the submitter may have intended for people to chili garlic sauce, you know the kind you find in the Asian section of your grocery store, now that stuff has a bit more kick to it! I cut the recipe in half, used chili garlic sauce, minced garlic instead of powder, added a little sesame oil, and a pinch of ginger.  I let them marinate all day and grilled them.  They came out very moist and had a nice \"spice\" to them.",
