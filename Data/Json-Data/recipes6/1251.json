Didn't make bbq sauce, although it sounds really good. But I didn't have time for that, so I used KC Masterpiece Original. We did a taste test between that and Sweet Baby Rays original, and KC won out hands down.  I served this to 10 guests and several went back for seconds (and thirds) and I still had a good bit left over. But no one seemed to object to taking a little home for a snack later.  Thanks for this recipe!  Will no doubt make again.",

I added about 1/3 C HP sauce in place of 1/3 C of ketchup and a few other personal preferences like more fresh garlic and added no celery. With our own farm grown pork it was super tasty! Served it on homemade white dinner buns. Will definitely make it again! One thing to note - I used the Original Crock Pot to cook mine. You should know that the \"Low\" setting only means it takes longer to heat up to the cooking temperature. Once it reaches cooking temp \"Low\" is equal to \"high\" so watch it carefully once you mix the sauce with the shredded pork or the sugars will burn.",
