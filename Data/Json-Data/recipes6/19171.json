I didn't have green tea powder so I took the advice of another user and bought Stash Green Chai tea bags opened each bag poured the loose tea into a coffee grinder and ground to a fine powder. The results were wonderful and everyone at the party commented on how great the taste was...green tea with a hint of spice and not too sweet. I had to double the frosting however. I made these into cupcakes so I reduced the baking time to 15 minutes and they came out perfect. I will definitely make these again!",

Also be careful as to the amount of powder you add to the icing. I judged it by eye to keep it a light (minty) green colour because if you add to much it'll end up looking like a Ninja Turtle...",

It's taken me a few months to make this -- I FINALLY decided to splurge & buy the matcha (which by the way if you are not near a store that sells matcha you can go to www.teavana.com). The green color looked great. The frosting is marvelous. I thought the amount of sweetness was just right. I added a little extra matcha & vanilla--very slight amount & the only other change I made was to use all regular flour (that's what I had on hand). The cake is moist & wonderful. I kept it refrigerated in a sealed container. I happen to love green tea...not everyone does. Next time I may increase the frosting ingredients by 1/4. Yummy!! Thanks Suki!",

I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for half of the oil and added an extra tsp. of matcha (so 5 tsp. total). Also I used 2 tsp. of vanilla and soy milk instead of regular. I didn't have matcha on hand so I used exactly 10 teabags of green tea and grounded it in a blender. That was enough powder for the entire cake including the frosting. I did have to double the amount of frosting to cover both layers and I also reduced the powdered sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/4.
