Just put the same amount of sugar in as you have liquid from cooking the quinces and cook to the jelly point.  I think I'd simmer the quinces a little longer, too, and it looks to me like there ought to be more water.\n\nQuince/apple jelly is really delicious.  Just substitute half of the quince liquid with pure apple juice.\n\nI would like to add, also, that there are two kinds of quince.  There are the quince from a tree that grows approximately 10 feet tall.  They look like a cross between an apple and a pear.  The quince that grows on a short red-flowering bush are less tasty and, in my experience, are mostly seed and not all that pleasant to eat.  ",
