I was expecting a much chunkier thicker cookie. I stuck the rest of the cookie dough in the fridge cause I got busy with the kids and took it out to use the rest today. What a huge difference some fridge time made! This time the cookies came out thick crunchy and delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again but plan on refrigerating the dough before baking.",

I even had some difficulty keeping the the little dough balls in mounds on the cookie sheet. But when they came out of the oven....wow. They're not the prettiest cookie I've ever made but the looks were deceiving. The cookies are sweet and gooey and soft and chewy and chocolaty and oatie all at once. And they stayed that way long after the chocolate chips had set. The peanuts were unexpected and made these cookies particularly delicious. Normally I give most of what I bake away - Hubs didn't want me to this time. Still I think if I were to make these again I'd add a tablespoon or two of milk to moisten the dough.",
