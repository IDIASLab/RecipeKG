This dish, on the other hand, has the delicious taste you know and love, but is made with ground beef and served as a rice bowl. The whole recipe is anxiety-free and takes just a few minutes. Your kids and friends will love this healthier dinner, and you will feel like you're on the streets of Seoul.",
