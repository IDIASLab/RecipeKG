The ingredients don't list salt but since I didn't have self rising flour a substitute is to add baking powder and salt to all-purpose flour which is what I did. No additional salt was required though. The only thing I should have done differently is keep it in the oven maybe 5 minutes less because the outside got a little too dark; other than that...perfect!

I even called my mom to tell her that her recipe (that was passed on from her grandmother) has seen its last generation because I won't use it anymore. This cake comes out dense like a pound cake but soft and moist like a regular cake. Absolutely wonderful! And it makes a sweet crust on top that is delicious. The only problem that I ran into was putting it into a cold oven and then turning it to 350. It burned on the bottom. Maybe next time I'll put the pan in when the oven is heated up halfway to give the cake a little time to rise but hopefully not burn. Very easy and tasty recipe. Thank you!!
