So moist, I can't stop eating it...\n  I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference in mine was I used regular sugar and regular flour~I like the Wheat Montana flour so much better than the popular brands. \n I used a bunt pan. I sprayed the pan and put the pecan mixture in then the cake batter on top and cooked it for 45min. I think it could have finished baking in about 40min.\n Thanks for an awesome recipe.",

I followed recipe except didn't quite have 1 cup of ripe mashed bananas-so I mixed in 1/2 cup applesauce to the bananas and I used 1/4 cup brown sugar in with the superfine white sugar and I had no nuts so I added about 1/4 cup of chopped dates instead for the topping. It came out great!! Really moist and very tasty...not at all like a dry banana bread. I will definitely make again.",
