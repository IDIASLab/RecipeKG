I used 4 rounded T of instant cofee disolved in just a litte more that 1 T water, only 1 cup of sugar, and 1/4 cup egg beaters in place of the egg. I made the large muffins and baked them for about 35 minutes, then left them in the oven to cool with the door open.  They turned out very moist, and the flavor was wonderful...and low-fat!",

I read all the reviews for this recipe and did make a few changes that were suggested. I used 1/4c marg and 3/4c applesauce instead of the full cup of Marg., I used half white and half brown sugar but only used 1 cup total, 3 tbsp coffee in 2 tbsp water,1 1/2 c whole wheat & 3/4 c white flours and I added 2 tsp ground flax seed. They turned out very yummy!! Will definitely make again.",

Instead of adding the full 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter, I added 3/4 of a cup and used the rest of the cup to sprinkle on top along with chopped walnuts.  This made for quite a presentation.  Next time I might use less chocolate chips in the batter as the muffins were a bit sweet.  Overall a great muffin recipe.  Thanks Shelley.",
