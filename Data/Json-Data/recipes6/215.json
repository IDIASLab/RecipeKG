                "reviewBody": "This was my first try at a baked French toast, and it was YUMMY! As with most recipes, I scaled it down for my small family. I halved the recipe, added an extra egg and a little extra splash of milk, used whole grain bread (crusts on, cut into large cubes), and tossed the bread in the egg-milk mixture, rather than pouring it over. It filled an 8X8 pan perfectly. I baked it at the same temperature for the same amount of time. but because the bread was brown to start with, I judged the \"doneness\" by smell and touch, taking it out when it sprang back when I poked it. I especially like how it doesn't taste really \"eggy\", as my French toast often does. We wound up eating smaller servings than if I had prepared \"regular\" French toast, the equivalent of only one slice of bread per serving. With a few brown and serve sausages on the side, perfect! We'll have the last of it for brunch after church this morning. Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: Made a half batch of this last night with regular white bread, which I rarely buy, but it was on sale. The verdict: WAY better made with a nutty brown bread, I guess because of the little bit of extra texture. It's still a go-to recipe, but I think the rest of the white bread might be going to the birds...literally. UPDATE #2: I just made this as a last minute idea, so it only sat for about an hour before I baked it, and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between a one hour rest vs an overnight rest.",

My family LOVED it! \nActually, I made it for dinner, with some bacon and scrambled eggs.  :) It tasted a lot like eating a cinnamon roll.  VERY SWEET and yummy.  \nI used 7 eggs and 2/3 cup of milk (since some others had said it was a little dry) and it was just right. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the milk/egg mixture and sprinkled the top with cinnamon before pouring it over.  I refrigerated it for a couple hours before baking and that worked fine!  \nIt was really too sweet to add butter and syrup, but I would like to try it with a fruit topping and some whipped cream.  \nNext time I might try spreading the 2nd layer of bread with sweetened cream cheese and blueberry pie filling or chopped apples (between the bread layers) for a 'stuffed' french toast.

I add more brown sugar to the bottom of the dish, too so when I cut it and flip it over on the plate, it's buttery and sweet. Served with grits and breakfast meat this is one of our favorite meals. Oh, and I don't refrigerate over night either and it's still great. I will for this year's Christmas morning meal. Thanks!",
