I followed the recipe to a T except I did what others suggested - cream the butter and sugar well (for about 5 minutes).  I mixed everything with the electric mixer and at the end my batter looked like yellow Cool Whip.  The flavour is buttery and the sweetness is just right.  Just make sure to frost it light because it doesn't need a lot of it.  The texture of the cake (both times I made it) was in between a pound cake and a fluffy cake.  Mine was NOT like cornbread at all.  Thank you for this great recipe. ",

I used Penzey's double strength vanilla and,   for extra richness and moistness, I  added an egg yolk in addition to the two eggs called for. This cake has a coarse crumb which I'm sure would be great for cakes where it's important they are sturdy and hold their shape.  If you're looking for a more delicate cake with a fine crumb this would not be the recipe to use. I baked this in an 8\" round pan, then split it into two layers. I filled it with seedless raspberry jam, frosted it with \"Butter Cream Frosting 1,\" also from this site, and coated the sides in coconut.  Delicious combination of flavors, perfectly suited for this cake.  ",

This cake will hold up to shaping.  It is great alone but frosting is always nice too.  The only difference in my ingredients, is I don't ever have milk on hand, I used powdered milk, not really a difference.  Do not make if you like lighter than air, froo froo cake.",

I did add an extra egg yolk and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract to the vanilla (for a little more flavor).  If your cake is coming out dry and like \"cornbread\", you are likely not using cake flour and you are not softening the butter and whipping it with the sugar until very fluffy.  Be sure and use large sized eggs also. If your palate is only used to box cake mixes, this recipe will seem heavy and dense, but it shouldn't come out like cornbread if executed properly.  One other tip, be sure your eggs are at room temperature and your butter is very soft - basics for good baking.  Good luck and don't dismiss this recipe. ",
