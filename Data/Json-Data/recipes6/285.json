The only thing that I changed was that I used sliced almonds instead of pecans. (couldn't find the pecans in my freezer aka \"the black hole\" LOL. I ended up with too much batter for a regular muffin pan so next time I will prep 18 regular muffin cups and spread out the caramel/nuts a little thinner on the bottom. This is a terrific recipe.

I saw Mauigirl's review last night and thought \"Aha!\" These were moist and tasty and 2 out of the 3 kiddos had a second muffin. Around here that alone could be worth 5 stars. I did leave the pecans out of theirs lest they thought I was trying to poison them. The caramel \"goo\" on the bottom was yummy and does remind me of pecan pie. The only big problem I had was that I'm afraid my muffin pan will never come clean. Despite greasing the cups very well these puppies stuck like nobody's business. I was able to run a knife around the edges and they ended up coming out fairly easily but some of the caramel and muffin stayed in the pan. Since everyone liked them and they are easy to make with pantry staples I will likely make again. I will just have to figure out how to get them to release more easily. I got 12 muffins with just a little batter left over. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

The first time I followed this recipe as-is (with the exceptions of 2% milk instead of skim grapeseed oil instead of veggie oil due to soy allergies and real butter instead of margarine because.... ew. And soy). It was good - really good. The only thing I felt it lacked was a big punch of cinnamon - these ARE supposed to be reminiscent of cinnamon buns after all. The second time I made these I deviated very slightly. Here is my list of ingredients (some are as originally written): 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour 1 full tablespoon of cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 eggs lightly beaten 1 cup of 2% milk (studies are showing that 2% and Vitamin D milk are actually better for you because the fat actually makes you feel fuller faster) 2 tablespoons of grape seed or avocado oil instead of veggie oil 2 rounded tablespoons of cranberry-cinnamon applesauce instead of plain- you can buy it seasonally at some farmer's markets or make your own. It's DELICIOUS. 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 full tablespoon of vanilla extract For the topping: 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup packed brown sugar 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans Follow directions as written. I did 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12 standard as my hubby is a marine with a BIG appetite. He's ever so politely requested that I make them at least once a week since.",
