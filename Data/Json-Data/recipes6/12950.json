The orange marmalade ones were the best! which surprised me.  i also did not use powdered sugar, and they were fine.    very yummy cookies.  only thing is that they lacked a little bit of umph, which i am not sure what, since i am not a great cook/baker.

You do not need to grease the cookie sheet, as these have enough butter in them to not stick to the pan. I used a round teaspoon dipped in sugar to depress the centers with before filling with the jam. These come out perfectly when baked on an airbake sheet. They tend to get too brown on the bottom if you use a regular cookie sheet. It took a while to get the bake time right, but once I did, oh WOW! Wonderfully buttery cookies! I made 2 batches, one with seedless boysenberry preserves, the other with homemade apricot jam. I preferred the apricot, and these got rave reviews at Bunco! I'm making more today!",
