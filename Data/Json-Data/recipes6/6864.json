We carved several pumpkins this year so I had plenty of seeds to play with so I split them up to try some different cooking methods. I tried this one first because it didn t require soaking or drying and it wasn t going to take an hour. After I made these and tasted one I decided not to even waste my time trying the other cooking methods these came out perfect! Thanks for sharing your cooking method!",
