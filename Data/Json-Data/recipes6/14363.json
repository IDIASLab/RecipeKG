The trick to the syrup is put your sugar and spices in 8 or 8 1/2 cups of hot water; stir till dissolved and place over low heat. Then mix 2 cups water 3 TBS lemon juice and corn starch and set aside. After you have the apples sliced and packed in the jars bring the sugar mixture almost to boiling stir in your cornstarch mixture and pour it into the sugar mixture. Stir or wisk mixture quickly. When the white of the cornstarch disappears, laddle over sliced apples. I use 3 tsp cinnamon and Florida Crystals unprocessed sugar. I also leave off the food coloring. It makes 9 quarts every time for me, but I pack the apples within 1 inch of the top. I have made 54 quarts already this year. Most to give as Christmas gifts.",

We left the 1/2\" of headspace as it said, but the filling expanded & oozed out of the jars. Obviously they didn't seal.  We repacked & reprocessed leaving 1\" of headspace with great results.  As most other reviews on this recipe suggested, we kicked up the spices (1 T + 1t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. clove, 1/4 t. allspice).  We left out the food coloring.  The kitchen smelled fabulous, the jars were beautiful, the taste was delish.  We used Jonathans this time, but will try Granny Smith in a few weeks when they're ready at the local orchard.  I'm sure we'll be making this recipe again & again.",

I found that 6 1/4 lb. apples and 1 1/4 recipes of the syrup filled my 7 quart jars...I may have needed the extra syrup because I left it simmering the whole time I was preparing the apples. I used Jonathan apples and did not peel them, which cut down on prep time. I also used just slightly more spice than the recipe calls for; you can always add more when you go to make the actual pie. Also, when packing the jars, I found it easier to do layers of apples & syrup, rather than adding all the syrup at the end...it was too thick to seep down the sides without leaving big air pockets.",

I dont have a canner so I used a big pot like I do when I make jelly. I only had 4 lbs of apples so I used the custom feature to scale this recipe down. I took other suggestions and used part brown sugar and increased the cinnamon and used pumpkin pie spice. My question is...are the apples supposed to still be \"crisp\" when you open the jar? When I sampled the next day they were just as crisp and fresh tasting as they were when I filled the jars. I have only made canned jelly and not sure what the texture is supposed to be on this recipe. Nonetheless they do taste great!",
