I use a turbo roaster for baking and I find that the puffs would stay in shape better if I bake them at 450F for the first 20 mins, then 350 for the next 5 mins, then 250 for the last 5 mins. This way the puffs are cooked inside (it taste less eggy, if the insides aren't cooked they look and taste like scrambled eggs). As for those who said that their pastry didn't puff, i think you better check the temp, lower temp won't help the pastry puff, it also causes you're dough to be soaked in butter (deep fried dough as my brother called it)as i've experienced.",
