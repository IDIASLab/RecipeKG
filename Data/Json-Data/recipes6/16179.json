                "reviewBody": "These cookies get 5 stars for taste, but the recipe gets a fail. This is a difficult, poorly written recipe. I would not recommend it for inexperienced bakers or people with little patience.  Suffice to say if you decide to attempt it, do the following: Plan to chill the dough for several hours before rolling, and even then, it will still be sticky and soft, so roll it out between two sheets of wax paper (which is not an easy task in itself so alternatively, use one sheet on the bottom and flour your rolling pin lightly and continuously as you roll). Remove the top sheet and simply divide the filling evenly between the two rectangles, leaving none leftover for the 'dollop' (there is not a sufficient amount otherwise). Using the bottom sheet of paper to help you along, roll the dough into a tube. Wrap and let chill in the freezer for about half to one hour. Take a length of dental floss and cut the rolls into sections. Put one roll back to chill in the fridge or freezer while the other is baking. Bake on an insulated cookie sheet for 12 to 15 minutes (they will still spread to about 3 times their original size). If using a non insulated sheet, line it with parchment and bake for the recommended amount of time, or until JUST starting to get light brown around the edges(watch them closely).  Leave to cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes and then carefully remove to a cooling rack. Good luck.",

Many people that I shared these with could not stop eating them...there were only a couple who didn't care for these. I made the dough exactly as written, except that I didn't have any butter-flavored shortening, and used plain instead. I rolled each half of the dough out, and poured half of the filling on each piece. After rolling it into a  log, I put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. I cut it into slices, totally skipped the dallops of filling on the cookie sheet, and they were perfect. It is very important to cool the cookies on the cookie sheet for about 7 minutes so that the filling can harden up again...if you take the cookies off too soon, the filling will fall out, and the cookies will not look as pretty. It is also important to keep putting the dough rolls in the freezer in between sheets of cookies. All together, this is an incredible recipe that I will make again! Thanks for sharing!",

Then rolled the dough out onto wax paper for easier rolling,using the wax paper to help me roll it without cracking the dough. After I let the filling cool and thicken, I used all of the filling in the roll . I used a whisk to help incorporate the butter better. I chilled the dough again for about an hour. Then cut the cookies with a sharp knife and baked on wax paper according to directions. I left them on the sheet for a couple of minutes then moved them to a rack to cool. They were very pretty and OMG they melt in your mouth! They retained their shape and looked like a cinnamon roll. I thought I would ice them, but found after tasting them uniced, they did not need anything else. Great with coffee or a nice cold glass of milk!",

I suggest doubling the sugar spread. Instead of going through all of the trouble of flipping the cookie sheet and all that I just spread a dab on the top of each cookie and that worked great. I also had no problem with the spreading as I took Linda McClean's advice and put the dough in the fridge after I rolled it. Worked fine and I will seek that topping next time. YUM-YUM!
