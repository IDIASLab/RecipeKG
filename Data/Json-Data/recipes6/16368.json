You can add more or less of the spices to suit your taste with no problem. The only thing I would most definately change is the cooking temp. If you use a large 9x5 pan, cook at 325 or the bottom and sides will be hard and dried out, if not burned by the time the middle is cooked. Bake at 325 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Also, you can get 7 mini loaves out of this recipe which is great for gift giving. Cook time on the mini loaves is about 45 at 325.",

Also my bread took nearly 1.5 hours to bake (for the center to cook). Coming out of the oven the outside was very dry but the inside very moist. I wrapped the loaves in foil overnight, still warm, and by morning, including the crust, the loaves were very moist. The bread got rave reviews overall so the recipe is a keeper I'm sure I'll make again. Great for the fall/winter holidays.",
