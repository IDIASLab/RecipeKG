I also added thin cucumber slices and red and green bell pepppers and used olive oil instead of veggie oil. I found the juice to be flat - I wanted more dimension than just sour and flat - so I tossed in some Mrs. Dash table blend and a dash of galic salt and then microwaved the mixture so that the sugar would melt and the tastes would blend. From the spoon it tasted like oil but dip a cucumber slice and... WOW!",
