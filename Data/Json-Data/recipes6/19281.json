I pureed all of the pears (didn't have quite as much as recipe called for because I used some in pear-tinis;o) ) I did make the carmelized onions (they had a lot to the soup!) but I only used a couple tbp of butter half an onion & sprinkled them w/ salt instead of sugar. The only sherry I had was a cream sherry but it worked. I started the meal off w/ Pear-tinis (even hubby liked those) served this soup w/ a salad (w/ pear/honey vinaigrette) garlic toast & finished it off w/ Pears w/ Raspberry Sauce. Thansk for a very enjoyable recipe namaste2uom!",
