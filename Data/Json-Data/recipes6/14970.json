Experience has shown me this really helps. For those who remark this tastes like or has the texture of corn bread perhaps you're not beating your butter and sugar long enough? You really have to beat it for a good 2-3 minutes to aerate it which definitely makes all the difference in terms of texture. I made these into cupcakes and added 1 tsp. of grated lemon zest to the batter. Frosted with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting also from this site.",

This is one of the lightest cakes I have ever made and as a semi-professional baker that says a lot. This one is getting filed. For those who had a problem with dryness. Never sccop out the flour spoon it into the measuring cup and level it. Too much flour = dry cake. Also beat the butter sugar till it's really well creamed together and add eggs one at a time beating to death after each one. Good luck.",

I do think I overbaked it some but I don't think the was the entire reason for the dryness. The cake is quite dense as well. In my opinion while the flavor is good I willmore than likely use the box next time or maybe add pudding or egg yolk to the mixture? Not sure. I was just bummed b/c i tried to follow the advice of another reviewer and ensure that I creamed my butter and sugar well yet I had a really dry cake. Oh well. I did pair it with the sour cream chocolate cake frosting on this site - which is very chocolatey!",
