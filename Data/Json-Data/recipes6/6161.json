This may be a little more on the citrusy side than I\u2019m used to and I'm not convinced you need the lemon as well as the lime (lime's traditional), but it is still very good.  I had a 2-1/2 lb pork loin, checked the internal temperature at 2 hours, and it already was up to 190\u00baF, so don\u2019t expect \u201cslightly pink in the center.\u201d  It really needs the additional cooking time anyway to tenderize.  Typically made with a pork shoulder, this pork loin roast certainly was tender and flavorful (and less fat). Do plan on serving the broth in the cooker, it's delicious and necessary to keep0 the pork moist.  We\u2019re having shredded pork tonight, and then I\u2019ll slice the other two small pieces for the weekend.  I\u2019d make this again.",
