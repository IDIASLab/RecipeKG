The green color was almost imperceptible as was the creme de menthe flavoring in the baked cookie dough. The only noticeable mint flavor came from the chips themselves. Although they were good next time I'll just add mint chocolate chips to a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe and save my creme de menthe. I bought a bottle especially for this recipe and essentially wasted my money as neither the color nor the flavor came through in the cookies.",

I guess I wasn t too good at following directions because I mistakenly interpreted the chips called for as mint chips (green) not mint CHOCOLATE chips (brown).

The cr\u00e8me de menthe lends just the right amount of mint flavor to the cookie but it also lends a not particularly attractive color which is sort of a greenish-brown. Deceptive because they re surprisingly good.",
