It turned out very greasy. I also cooked it longer than 1 hour... until the center seemed set. This caused my butter-saturated crust to also be nearly burnt. 1/2 cup of butter worked out much better the pie is rich but not oozing melted butter. I also only cooked for the specified hour. When still warm the pie is goopy and not that good but after chilling it sets up perfectly and tastes like chocolate chip cookies in pie form so I definitely advise only cooking for an hour even if it seems underdone when you take it out of the oven (like pecan pie). Serve chilled with whipped cream.",

He said it was just like eating a chocolate chip cookie, only better, because it was nicely paired with the pie crust, which added a buttery, flaky flavor to it.  (I had used butter-flavored shortening in the crust.)  Thank you! ** Edit: I have made this several times now and it is always exceedingly well received. The last time, I tasted it myself and can say that it is quite delicious. It doesn't have the texture of a chocolate chip cookie in a pie shell; rather, the filling is more like the texture of a pecan pie, while it tastes like a chocolate chip cookie (from the semi-sweet chocolate). It is very decadent and would go famously served warm with ice cream or a little whipped cream.  ",
