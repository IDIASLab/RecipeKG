Just served to several coworkers who devoured the pies in 10 minutes. Will make again. Update: made again this week - important to let the filling cool completely. I didn't let it cool long enough (only an hour an 15 min) because I was tired and wanted to go to bed. So, the next morning when I cut the pie at work it was a bit runny. So, make sure you cool completely. Will take about 2 to 3 hours to cool to room temperature.",

I didn't make a pie out of it cause I was just experimenting with it I just made the sauce and put the strawberries into it and put it in the frige. It was really too thick once refrigerated. It may have been ok if left at room temperature but I don't know cause it was late and I put in the frige while it was still a little bit warm.. And to me it was too sweet. But that may depend on the ripeness of your berries. Mine were really ripe. Maybe if I add a little less cornstarch and less sugar it would be ok.. another suggestion is to run a few berries in a blender and add to the sauce to make it taste less like artificial strawberry flavor from the jello and more like real strawberry flavor. Overall this recipe was ok at best... it wasn't horrible but it wasn't wonderful either..",
