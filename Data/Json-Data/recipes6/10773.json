By far the best way I have found to use up the huge bagful of hazelnuts that my mother-in-law dropped off a few weeks ago. Although shelling the nuts takes a bit the cake itself is quick and easy to throw together. I had wanted to make the glaze as well but realized too late that I didn't have any cream so instead I added a half cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter and left the finished cake plain. I did not have high expectations when I took it out of the oven because it looked really hard on the top but after it cooled and we tasted it it is sooooooooooo good. I cooked mine a half hour and having left it a little tiny bit underdone made it almost have a \"brownie-like\" consistency. Very good...one of the best cakes I've had.",
