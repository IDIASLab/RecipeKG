Next time I think I will chop it and make all of the piece about the same size. Great if you are watching your calories 2 cups of this stuff is worth 156 calories. NOT bad and GOOD. You can also add spices to your serving such as cumin or a hot pepper to spice it up. Almost like a salsa but it never gets juicy. Keeps well in the refrigerate stays nice a crunch. An inexpensive dish to make and feeds alot of people.",

To follow the recipe makes a HUGE amount of food would recommend cutting it in half for parties under 10 where other items are to be served. Definately more of a salsa type dish best with corn chips or the like but very fresh and crisp for summer gatherings. I very much wanted to throw in a jalapeno but they are of course not available right now. I think a ripe avacado and some black beans could serve as a substitue for the Jicama here if you like me do not have it available in your area.",
