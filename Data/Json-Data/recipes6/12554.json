Every fall - it never fails - when the leaves start turning and the weather gets crisp I start getting requests for these cookies - it's crazy!  \nI make a few slight changes and these cookies turn out PERFECTLY!  First of all, I add 3 drops of red food coloring to the 'wet ingredient' mixture (to liven up the pumpkin's orange color).  Second, I bake the cookies at 365 degrees for 12 minutes instead of 350 degrees for 10 minutes (which, like others have said is not NEAR enough time to allow the cookies to cook through). And thirdly I place the cookies with a medium sized scoop on a greased cookie sheet, then I slam the cookie sheet down on the table a few times to get them to spread out a little (I find the cook more evenly and also look a lot more attractive).\nThese cookies are served best warm straight from the oven or cold straight from the refridgerator - I wouldn't recommend letting them sit on your counter, even if they are in a covered conatainer - the time I did that they got soggy and melted a little from the heat of our wood stove.  =)",

However is you really  like the pumkin taste as much as my family does, I would recemend putting in 1/4 less cinamin, it tends to cover the pumpkin flavor.  The other thing is, don't forget to add the vanilla.  It does not say when or where to put it in.  If making this for children I suggest adding 3 or 4 drops of red food coloring for the orange pumpkin look, the cookies are not orange after baking.",

I highly recommend these, I can't wait to bake them this fall for potlucks. You can also add a drop or two of orange coloring to get a deeper color of cookie.
