I actually enjoyed the tartness the tomatoes brought to the soup but my supply was limited and I'll admit this recipe made me nervous and I didn't want to use my entire stash of tomatoes. That is the only reason I subbed potatoes for some of the tomatoes. I have no regrets there either because they were a nice addition. The one complaint I have about this recipe is using all of the grease the 8 pieces of bacon yields. It gave the soup a rich bacon-y flavor yes but the end result was entirely too oily. I will definitely make this again next season when I can use the full amount of tomatoes but to be honest, I will still add some potatoes. It needs the depth in my opinion.",

With that said I knew 5 cups of green tomatoes would be too many for us. So I cut the amount of them to 2 cups and added 2 cups cubed potatoes instead. May have to add a little extra water to soup (as it cooks) if you use the potatoes. By cutting the amount of green tomatoes made it spot-on for us. I'm thinking about pureeing the cooked green tomatoes before adding any bacon next time. Good recipe if you want to try something interesting for a change and use up some left-over produce. Update: I forgot to mention that I rendered out fat in my bacon and then added to cooking soup, I got the flavor but not so much of the fat.",

                "reviewBody": "I'd made the Green Tomato Casserole recipe on this site and while it was tasty the texture was way too soupy and the shredded cheese most people recommended adding didn't melt right. (Probably bc of all the acid in the tomatoes.) So I used five heaping cups of THAT for the five cups of green tomatoes called for in this recipe. (The casserole had celery and onions as well -- I used Vidalias rather than green. The casserole has you cover the toms/onions/celery in a whisk of 1/4 c olive oil 2 T brown sugar 5 T soy black pepper red pepper flakes.) I think it was the soy/brown sugar/red pepper flakes -- and how they mixed w/ the liquid in the toms to make a rich sauce/gravy -- that added a richness and depth to the soup that made it so yummy. Like others I added a large potato and that too added some creaminess and depth. I also put some red toms in for added color but the flavor was lovely as well. Finally used an entire pound of bacon but cut out most of the fat before saute-ing. I realize all the above is a pretty radical change but it was so delicious I'm about to make a second batch as we ate the first in just two sittings! (Though I am starting w/ the casserole recipe -- sans cheese -- in order to make that rich gravy as it seems key to the soup!",
