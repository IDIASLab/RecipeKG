There was no way to 'pack' the choco. raisins and chips in a way that the flour mixture would not seep through even a little. These were very easy to mix up for baking and tasted great but I had an issue w/ one pan looking just ok and the other pan all running together into a thin layer (still tasted good tho). I think these would be great for a bar cookie...just press the mixture into a pan and bake it up! I may try that b/c they are tasty just not so pretty. Thanks for sharing.:)",
