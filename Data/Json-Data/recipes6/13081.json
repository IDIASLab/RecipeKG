I like to experiment with different fillings.. once I added 3/4c chopped dried cranberries and 1/3c almonds and substituted vanilla extract for almond extract and drizzled with white chocolate cinnamon mix and it was DELICIOUS. Another favorite altercation is to add one chopped and frozen large candy bar (I use a local organic hazelnut milk chocolate bar... symphony bars work as well) and add crushed bits to mix before baking. They seem to melt instantly when dipped into hot coffee.\nAnother idea is 3/4c shredded coconut and 1/4c white chocolate bits. After they have cooled dip them into white chocolate and sprinkle with coconut ! Soooo very good and sooo easy to make.\nMy boyfriend hates crunchy biscotti, but absolutely loves this recipe.. And my mother loves hard crunchy biscotti and just raves about how good of a recipe this is. I brought a double batch of candy bar biscotti to work and they didn't even last 2 days before they were completely devoured by co-workers !!\nFor christmas, I am adding nutmeg, cinnamon, peppermint extract and crunched ghiradelli peppermint chocolates to the mix. Topping with white chocolate and peppermint sprinkles :)\nThis recipe is THE best and originality makes it even better !",

I also baked them in my convection oven at 330 degrees for the same amount of time - took them out and cut them right away - not one broke - put them back in and baked them again for 10 mins. on each side - on the second side I shut the oven off after 10 minutes and just let them set there for about 15 or so minutes. They were very crisp like biscotti should be - very easy to handle during the dough stage and the taste was devine!! Used dark and white chocolate on some - and left some plain. First time I ever made biscotti - used to eat them frequently at a gourmet coffee/candy store that I managed ---these were better!! Thanks!! 11-5-14 Just finished making two batches of biscotti doing the usual almond with one batch while doing coconut/walnut with the other - I use coconut extract also. With white chocolate on top - their kinda hard to beat...unless your not a coconut fan. I have to admit - my husband and I like a biscotti at night for dessert - we may have it with a cup of chai or....nothing;)",

I add walnuts and either butterscotch bits or cinnamon bits and they get raves. I've read where some have problems with the biscotti crumbling when they cut them and I'll tell you how I over come that. I use a bench scrape to cut them when they are still hot not a knife. My scrape is teflon covered but I don't think that's why it works so well. Another hint is that I line the cookie sheet with the new foil that is non-stick. Finally a product that does what it promises. You can not go wrong with this recipie and I am greatful to have found it. It has made me a baking hero and I thank you very much!",

I don't care for nuts at all (except almonds) so I added a little less than called for (1 c. seemed like too much so I used 3/4 c. instead) and that seemed to be the perfect amount (you could still taste the nuts but they didn't overpower every bite). I doubled the amount of cinnamon to 2 tsp. and subbed 1/2 tsp. of almond extract b/c I didn't have enough vanilla on hand (used all of the 1 tsp. that I had plus the almond extract) and the biscotti tasted just fine. After the cookies cooled I melted a dark chocolate Ghirardelli bar with a bit of shortening (over a double boiler) and dipped one side of the biscotti in the mixture and then refrigerated on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet to set. I don't drink coffee but I can imagine how wonderful these would taste with a cup of brew (one of my Christmas gifts was a bag of biscotti and a bag of Christmas blend coffee all tied up with a bow and a cute Christmas plate). I'll have to ask the giftee how it was:) I'll definitely make these again next year... but for myself!",

Not really what you think of as a \"biscotti\"...more like dried cake. Also the dough flattened out way too much when baking. I will not try this recipe again. I found a nice pistachio/cranberry biscotti recipe from another site which I've already made several times. I will stick with that recipe...they are delicious!!",
