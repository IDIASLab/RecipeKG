Since it also contains a good amount of lysine, it is a complete protein. I made a few changes to the recipe - only had organic beef stock (in the box) and dried herbs. Used a couple of green onions and two cloves of garlic. Also added a little ground pepper. Great and easy way to serve up quinoa. Note about rinsing or soaking: normally, quinoa has a bitter saponins coating that is removed by soaking it or rinsing it. Most of the quinoa sold in the USA has already had the coating removed so rinsing is not required. But best check your source!",

Everything that I learned pointed toward quinoa as the most nutritious grain out there, so I had to try it. I followed the direction of others and really enjoyed this dish. I began by melting the butter and saut\u00e9ing the onion and garlic for two minutes. Then I added the quinoa and returned to the recipe. I chose to use chicken broth instead of vegetable and decided to add some shrimp seven minutes into the simmer. Once I got past the strange texture of this grain, I really enjoyed it. I will make this recipe again. Trust me, you don\u2019t have to be a health nut to enjoy this recipe. (By the way, it took about 25 minutes or more for the grain to incorporate all of the liquid.)",
