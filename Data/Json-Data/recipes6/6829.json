If I could give it ten stars I would!!!!!!!!  \r\nA time-saving/personal note:\r\nMy husband and I live an hour from the nearest supermarket, so we rarely have lots of fresh vegetables on hand.  I had the onion and bell pepper, but used canned diced tomatoes (drained, of coarse), and fortunately I had a bag each of frozen green beans and corn (not on the cob), which I just thawed in hot water.  I used these in place of fresh vegetables, and the recipe still turned out fabulous!!!!  For people without much time on their hands, this saves a fair amount of chopping and preparing.  Just an idea.. worked for me!!!",
