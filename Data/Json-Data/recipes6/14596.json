Sunmaid makes a bag of raisens called \"mixed raisens\", they are huge and extremely plump and moist and were simply perfect for this salad.

I'd decrease the mayo to about 1/3 cup, and add an extra apple.  The amount of walnuts is fine, but make sure they're chopped very small or they taste a little bitter.  The celery is a fabulous addition, adds great crunch, and the recipe could actually use just a little more than it calls for.  The raisins I'm undecided on.  I didn't like them at first, but they're growing on me.  With or without, this recipe is a good one.  By tweaking it a little, and using very crisp apples, this is a five star recipe.  Thanks!",

Grapes and/or raisins are another variation, but I don't often use them.\n\nGood variations would be using plain yogurt instead of mayo.
