The second time I prepared them, I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I also cooked the chops at a lower temperature (medium high) to prevent burning. Finally, I served them with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce found here on allrecipes (1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, 1/4 cup honey, and 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce). If you're using a thick cut pork chop, I suggest pounding it to make it thinner or placing the thick pork chops in the oven to finish cooking after browning. All in all, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.",

I've been expermenting with these crumbs now whenever breadcrumbs are called for and these Panko crumbs ROCK!!!!  Thanks submitter!  Update: Since discovering Panko crumbs I found a recipe for chicken on this site called Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce - It is also a 5 star+ recipe and the Tonkatsu sauce is also great with these pork chops.  I've actually had these in a Japanese restaurant with the sauce!",

This is so good that I haven't had to modify it too much. Suggestions to try though: Add a splash of sesame oil to your deep frying oil for a blast of asian flavor. Make sure the meat is thin less then a 1/4\" thick is good. If thick meat lower the temp of the oil to prevent the breading from scorching before the meat is cooked thru. Season your meat before coating and breading. Use powdered garlic and ginger instead of fresh minced since they are easier to incorporate into the egg or into the panko. Use fresh crushed Tien Tsin Chili pepper (little red asian pepper) added to panko for added heat (caution: a little adds a lot of heat). Tonkatsu sauce (or any sauce) is critical for this...I use store bought Bull-Dog Vegetable & Fruit Tonkatsu Sauce (can order online if not at your local asian market) instead of making my own which I can't get to taste as good as this.Enjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "Very tasty recipe...marinating and tenderizing (pounding) before making it helps. Also the CUT of meat you use is KEY. If it is dry you prob used cheap meat. In Japan we have HIRE (white meat) and ROSU (dark meat) - even good quality white meat will be super juicy. Of course this dish does not stand alone - you NEED sauce! The Japanese do not eat this without sauce...it would be the unthinkable. Please try authentic Tonkatsu sauce or...if in a pinch some A1 steak sauce. Don't try it w/out some dressing otherwise it is pointless to make it.:( Served with thinly sliced lettuce salad mini tomatoes for presentation...great. Lettuce reduces...er compliments the greasiness of the fried meat. Also if you have non-meat lovers the same technique can be used for SHRIMP. Very tasty...but be sure to cut the tail to prevent juices from flying and make incisions along the body to make the shrimp stand straight after frying. Fat-concerned folks: please fry panko in oil...then do like 'shake and bake' - then...bake...similar results...not AS tasty but definitely easier on the waist.",

Do let the coated chops sit for the optional time before frying as it really helps the coating stick! I didn't pound out my chops (forgot) but as they were only slightly thicker than 1/4 inch (maybe about 1/2 inch) I just cooked them at a lower temperature for a little longer. I seasoned the flour with seasoned salt pepper and garlic powder. I also added a little hot sauce (splash or two) to the egg mixture and left the panko plain. Serve this with 'Tonkatsu/Katsu' sauce from this site it's great!",

In the process of cooking I added flour with seasoned salt pepper and garlic powder. Egg mixture was not enough for the 8 chops so I doubled it as well as the panko crumbs with red pepper flakes. After dipping the chops I let them rest in the freezer for an hour or two. Then I fried it in hot vegetable oil with a splash of sesame oil. Have my fire set on low then fry each side for about 5 minutes until golden brown. The only thing that I regret about is I forgot to season the chops with garlic powder and ground ginger I'll do that again next time though. Thank you Shin98 =)",

Working up with the larger pieces pound to same thickness as the smaller one. Marinade with soy sauce hoisin sauce and a little Chinese 5 spice for half an hour. Then follow along with the rest of the directions. Will be served with lemon basmati rice buttered carrot coins and leftover turkey dressing. I will tell you later how it turns out.",
