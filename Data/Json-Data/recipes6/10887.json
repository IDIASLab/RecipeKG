So All Using a Bundt USE A DEEP BUNDT Pan WITH THIS RECIPE has Lots Of Batter.. If Using a Bundt Pan The Deeper the Better!..EVERYTHING ELSE.. IS EXCELLENT PERFECT RECIPE IN MY BOOK AND THE GUYS loved It..YES It's Sweet However a Glass Of Ice Cold Milk Sets It Off.. No Problem with the Sugar Any one Who Doesn't like a real Sweet Cake Perhaps just cut back to half a cup of Sugar in the Cake Mixing Part or Exclude the 1 Cup of Sugar all together.. I'm Posting Pictures of My Final Results for this Recipe. Note: The Bottom of the Cake It has a Crunchy Top like a Pound Cake and with my bundt Pan not being Deep enough it actually somewhat pulled away Or Rised to high IN THE BAKING PROCESS.. But the Taste Is to Die For Good..SUPER MOIST MELT IN YOUR MOUTH CAKE.. THANKS FOR POSTING! SEE PHOTO'S..",

It soaked into the cake and before pouring the rest of it the butter started to separate from the other ingredients.  Too much butter maybe?  I would make this cake again but either make changes to the icing recipe or use another all together.  By the way I baked the cake in a bundt pan.  I thought that made a prettier presentation.",
