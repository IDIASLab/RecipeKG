I did end up adding a little more lemon juice and cayenne to suit our tastes. I took the photo right when it came out of the microwave, and the butter had separated a bit.  But all it really needed was a good whisk, and then the texture was spot on, and stayed that way.  Served this on Ham Cups and Eggs, a recipe on this site.

By using an initial microwave time of about 15 seconds whisking and then increments of about 10 seconds whisking vigorously each time I had excellent control over the amazing finished product. Eggs benedict will be on my breakfast menu more often. Bon appetite!",

The only change I had to make is to continue cooking and whisking the sauce at 15 second intervals until it's thickened. (I suspect total cooking time depends on the temperature of the butter and egg.) If you let it go too long without whisking it will separate and the easiest way to fix that is just let it sit for 5 minutes or more until it smoothes out again.\n\n This recipe is good as written, but I've modified it a bit to suit me more. Now I use double the lemon juice and a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Then I add a dash of white wine vinegar per serving.\n\nI've found this recipe to be fool proof, quick and easy. Just keep a lemon in the refrigerator and you're always good to go.  The family members I've made this for like it, too. I mostly serve it on asparagus or fish cakes.\n\nNB - Use butter, not any kind of margarine, and a real egg yolk. I warm the egg in hot water so the yolk isn't cold.",
