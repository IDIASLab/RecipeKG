I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used all-purpose flour and added 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. They raised great! These are not the sweetest muffins but I thought it was amazing how the srawberry yogurt really did give them a nice hint of strawberry even with the small amount called for. This is also a great way to use up those leftover holiday sprinkles. Mine melted and you couldn't tell I used Turkey shaped sprinkles.:) Also a big hit with the kids. This is a keeper!",
