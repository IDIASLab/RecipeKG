You may want to consider sharing it with your camping friends or, if you're like our family and enjoy leftovers, just save the leftovers for the day you're leaving the campground and need a quick breakfast without a lot of mess and fuss. You can easily re-heat it in a microwave or in a skillet over low heat. Feel free to add more spices and personalize this recipe to suite your taste buds!",

When I cook in my Dutch ovens, I use CHARCOAL and wrote the instructions for using CHARCOAL.   6-9 coals underneath and 12 to 18 on top will give you approximately 350 degrees in your Dutch oven.   Also, as any seasoned Dutch oven cook will tell you, you need to monitor your coals and add more as they burn away to maintain the proper temperature.   Hope that helps!",

I just sauteed the sausage in the skillet with a little butter, then added the onion, garlic (I did add more garlic, six cloves or so), bell pepper, the hasbrowns and let them brown up in the grease. After the veggies had browned, I added the eggs. I stuck the whole skillet in the oven and baked it for the 40 minutes, then sprinkled the cheese and baked for another 20. I did salt/pepper the food while sauteeing the vegetables and I added a little hot sauce and garlic/onion powder to the eggs before adding it to the skillet. This was very easy for me to adapt to the stove and we all really liked this. I was tickled because I got a chance to use my cast iron skillet from start to finish.",
