About 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth. 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk. 1 cup of milk. Added salt. And about 3 TBSP of Peanut butter. Delicious!!! Next time I might get more coconut milk but we only had one can in the house. But the sweetened condensed milk made it amazing. We also put rice in our bowl with the recipe poured on top of it. Delicious and will make it again. Sure beats spending $25 eating out at our favorite restaurant once a week. ;)",

(to go) for several years...paying $10-$15 each time, depending on if it was lunch or dinner...I did this at least once a week (that's how much I LOVE it :) ).  I will NEVER again need to do this - this recipe tastes JUST like what I've been ordering and only cost me about $1.80 per meal....think of all the money I'll be saving and now I can have it for every meal if I so desire....Just delicious.  I added extra curry, salt and used one chicken bouillon cube in a cup of water instead of the broth (I was out of broth) ...I may add more spice next time as I like it HOT.  I can't wait to taste it again...think I'll go heat up another bowl of it ummmm ummm good :)",

Then I used 2 extra Tbs curry powder, 1/2 the chicken stock, 2x coconut milk to help make it thicker. Used all veggies plus added bean sprouts, water chestnuts, shiitake mushroom and green onion. Used chicken thighs in lieu of breast for more flavor and tenderness. Plus added 1lb shrimp. It taste more authentic now but the recipe was a good start. thx",

I also added 1 inch of lemongrass.  After cooking it let it stew in Dutch oven on simmer pretty much whole day.   I watched an old espisiode of Rachael ray where she was cooking red chicken curry and she said making curry in advance is the way to go so the flavors meld .\n\n My husband said  it was exactly like Thai restuarants.
