There are other brands of pareve margarine out there; I have found the Nucoa brand to be the best for baking. Everyone that eats my baked pareve items cannot believe that there is no dairy in them. I suggest that anyone who wants to make this recipe non-dairy try the Nucoa brand margarine you won't be disappointed.

It is a very easy recipe - make sure you use a real filling and not jam/jelly for a substitute. Jam will reduce and even run out the sides leaving thin lining of filling. The time in the freezer is a must even with special attention to pinching the sides into a triangle. You may still have ones that open up in the oven so don't get lazy or be in too much of a hurry. I also recommend brushing them with a beaten egg and then lightly sprinkling them with some ground cinnamon.",
