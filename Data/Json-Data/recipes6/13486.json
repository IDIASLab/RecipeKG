Every recipe I've tried comes out sticky and messy - but this one was absolutely perfect!\n\nI cut this recipe down and made two large crusts (more like 2 and a half) for a strawberry pie am just kicking myself for not making my own crust sooner.  Very easy, very tasty - this truely is a perfect pie crust!!\n\nOne trick I learned when it comes to pie crusts... before you start, put one or two pieces of plastic wrap on the counter top so that the plastic is a bit larger than the finished pie.  Then roll the pie out as normal - but instead of having to worry about it sticking to the counter, you can just pick it up by the plastic wrap and turn it over into your pie pan.  Works like a charm!",

                "reviewBody": "I am so pleased to have found this recipe. I like pie crust but I don't like most pie crust if that makes sense. I have been looking for years for a recipe that tastes good and I have finally found it. As a bonus this crust is so easy to work with I was able to pick it up and turn it as I rolled it in order to make a more perfect circle. I had no problems with tearing or stretching. This is the softest nicest crust I have ever worked with. This is also the first crust I was able to be patient enough with that I could make decorative edges on my pie. I also used the crust to make a lattice top on each of my pies and I had no issues with cracking when I bent the pieces to weave them or with sticking when I picked them up off the table. In short this is how pie crust should be. You may find that you need to add more water a spoonful at a time until the dough holds together. I also substituted powdered sugar for the white sugar the second time I made the crust and I will keep doing this in the future. Finally I also substituted butter for 2/3 of the shortening and still had a beautiful flaky crust. Also this recipe makes more than enough dough for 2 2 crust pies. I imagine it would be sufficient for 1 more 1 crust pie. We used our two cookie sheets worth of scraps as cookies with cinnamon sugar. yum. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!",
