The amount of coconut is just right. I cooked it up in 8\" pies- set up very nicely after the 45 min cook time.  The chocolate chips really add a ton to this pie.  My SIL said it reminded her of an Almond Joy bar.  What I will do in the future- add even more chocolate chips.  I will try a half cup more pecans, and maybe try toasting them ligtly before adding them to the mix.  They get lost in the coconut and sugar.",
