A very versatile soup you could add or omit almost any veggies that you please. I will make this again and probably play with the recipe more each time!",

I used 3 cups of mixed chicken instead of the wings and used the water the chicken had been cooking in for the water. I only put a 1/2 onion in as I am not a huge fan. Next time I may add some extra jalapeno. I liked it enough to take some to work for my co-workers to try and they all liked it. In fact I am forwarding this recipe to one of them as we speak.",

Somehow though the fresh green beans got left off of my list so I saved the frozen corn I bought for another day and just used a frozen corn green bean pea and carrot melody instead.I also found some mushroom stems and pieces in the fridge that I threw in at the last second. This recipe is so universal as to what you have on hand or things that need used up. My only complaint is that the base was extremely thin. My advice is to saute the veggies for a few minutes and then add a couple of teaspoons of flour to the mix before adding the can peas/hominy and other liquids for a bit of a thicker more rich broth.",

I did change a few things like using 4 cups chicken broth instead of water (always keep organic on hand) and reduced the water to 2 1/2 cups and use 2 packets of granulated chicken bouillon (hate cubes). Did not put in jalapeno peppers. Whole can of tomato sauce. No hominy! Used frozen: chicken wings zucchini (already sliced) butternut squash (already sliced) and mixed vegetables. The only things I had to slice and dice were the potatoes and onions (didn't have frozen chopped in freezer) I'm a firm believer in keeping my freezer stocked with fresh frozen foods. Really cuts down on prep time. I also used a bay leaf and a pinch of allspice for extra flavor. My family cannot handle very spicy food. Turned out great and added this recipe to \"My Recipes\". Thank you for an all-in-one pot meal!!",
