I made this for dinner tonight; I used 2 quite large boneless skinless chicken breasts (1.4 lbs total) and ended up with 15 pieces after I pounded it and cut it up (I just use kitchen shears to cut up chicken, they make it super easy).  I had to use 2 very large skillets to cook it all.  Also, I dip my chicken pieces in egg first, then flour (both mixed with salt & pepper), then let them sit until the egg and flour have kind of mixed together into a paste before cooking them.  Don't be afraid to turn up the heat a little... I melt the butter on a 6, add the chicken, let it brown about 5 minutes, turn it, brown it on the other side 5 minutes, then add the lemon juice and wine, turn down the heat to low and don't bother removing the chicken, but I do cover it at this point.  I don't add the capers until the end, and I turn the chicken one more time to coat it in the beautiful brown sauce that has formed! It has taken me quite a few tries to perfect this but tonight I can honestly say it was better than my favorite restaurant!",

I'm not sure why it's not easier to put the flour/salt/pepper in a baggie and shake it all.  The butter is what makes or breaks this recipe.  If you are making this one, just figure that you will splurge on the butter and don't mix it with olive oil (as I am usually wont to do).  I do always use more capers than called for because we love them.  I halved the recipe for a package of Costco's boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half both horizontally and vertically.  This is a hit and will be repeated!  I served it with Opa George's Wild Rice recipe.  Our dinner was SOOOO good!  Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "I used this recipe as a base.  Having made chicken piccata before I will say this is a good recipe.  Changes made:  I left out the lemon slices, which was a mistake. The slices should be very thin and cooked in the sauce so that they sweeten with the sauce and become edible. After removing the chicken I add fresh minced garlic and a thin chiffonade of fresh basil (about 2 tbs) just after the garlic has toasted then I add the wine.  I do not use parsley.\nSome of the processes in cooking are over simplified in the direction and likely is responsible for lower rating scores.\nThe biggest understatement is that the wine is not just cooked for 10 minutes, it is reduced till it traces behind the spoon when stirring.  That is, when you pull your spoon thru the reduction a trail of about 2\" where the bottom of the skillet is exposed before the sauce rejoins.  This is about the perfect thickness.  Also if the sauce is not sweet enough, you can always add more wine and reduce further.  After the wine is reduced, add the chicken back in and allow the chicken to soak up the sauce then put the chicken on a platter and spoon all the sauce, capers and basil over the chicken.\nIf there is not enough sauce with reason you can add a little more butter and wine and reduce again just prior to covering the chicken.",

                "reviewBody": "Butter and lemon is the flavor of the dish. Be careful not to burn the butter while browning the chicken. As you are browning the chicken in 1/2 cup butter. I used 1/2 a lemon juiced and thinly sliced 1/4 of the remaining lemon and cooked  with the sauce as a suggestion by another review.  No problem cooking the sauce down, which I doubled, as others indicted not enough sauce. Chicken tastes like butter (without the sauce), and the sauce had too much lemon flavor per our taste. Love the capers which I rinsed before adding to the sauce. I served the sauce on the side.",
