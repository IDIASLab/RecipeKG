I just put all the ingredients in the Magic Bullet and blended. The tomato mixture had good taste but think we would have enjoyed it more if it would have been heated. The directions weren't clear as to what to do with the pasta. Are you suppose to serve cold sauce over warm noodles? I will try this again with all the fresh tomatoes coming on - but next time I will warm the sauce and pour it over warm noodles.",

If the spaghetti is supposed to be cold shouldn't you rinse it like you do when making a cold pasta salad? Well that's what I did and then refrigerated it for a couple of hours before eating. When I ate it I inhaled it. It was good but you really have to like the ingredients. I don't think it would be universally appealing. With that being said I'm glad I made it tried it & of course ate it. However I'm not sure I would again unless someone gave me free garden tomatoes. Tomatoes are almost 3 a pound and the peeling and seeding was pretty time consuming & messy.",
