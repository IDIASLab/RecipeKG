I like it to be really moist and I find that the recipes with sour cream in them are best acomplished in this way, so I added 1 cup sour cream. I was also concerned with it not being chocolatey enough, so I added a few tablespoons of cocoa to the dry ingredients. I also added extra chocolate chips. I also did what other reviewers suggest, and add the choc chips to the dry ingredients so they don't sink and it worked well. I added a little more zucchini also. And seriously, this is the absolute best bread I've put zucchini into ever! And I've been making different zucchini bread recipes all week. (I have a ton of zucchini in my garden). With the changes I made, I would consider it about perfect! I'll make it again and again. You would never know it had zucchini in it. It's perfectly moist and delicious. Like a rich chocolate cake. Just wonderful!",

I also coated the chocolate chips (regular size) with flour and they did not sink, as others had indicated. I used whole wheat flour, but instead of 2 cups, used 1 3/4 cups as I find whole wheat flour tends to be heavier and take away from the moisture. With this recipe I will use the full 2 cups next time. I also used half white sugar and half turbinado (brown) sugar. Next time I will try using even more turbinado, and less white sugar.

Using the correct size pans, and knowing my oven temperature is correct, each loaf turned out to be about one inch tall on the sides and about two inches tall in the middle, which means that they are rather flat. I could have put all of the batter into one loaf pan, which I think I'll do next time. The bread is too sweet, and I have a massive sweet tooth, but the texture is fantastic. It is basically a chocolate cake, with an invisible zucchini surprise, and that's fine by me! All of my chocolate chips sank, despite adding a flour coat. If I were to make this again, I'd drastically reduce the sugar (I'd start out with one cup and see where that got me), and either use smaller loaf pans or one large one. Another thing: my loaves were finished at 50 minutes, so check yours before the time is up to make sure they don't burn.",
