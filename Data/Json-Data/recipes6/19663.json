I also used about twice as much cinnamon as it called for because we really like it and left out the ginger because I didn't have any. I also skipped the the syrup because I forgot to buy apple cider. They were delicious with regular syrup. Next time I'll probably add more brown sugar because not quite sweet enough for me. Otherwise a great recipe! I'll probably make on Thanksgiving morning. ",

I used 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of clove in place of only 1tsp of allspice and a hair more pumpkin. It's really important that you whip your egg whites long enough so they do have peaks and fold in gently so the batter will start to get light and fluffy/airy feeling you'll see it start to change othewise they are too dense and will sit in your stomach like a rock. I found too they do need to cook longer than regular waffles but also try a little higher heat setting if yours adjusts like mine normally set at a 3.5 put up to a solid 4 and worked much better. For the apple cider syrup I use water and fresh cut up apples instead less white sugar add brown sugar and nutmeg. Delish! Have also made apples w/ less sugar and then just drizzled real maple syrup over waffles and apples before serving. That also got rave reviews.",

We altered the recipe to suit our toddlers' taste:  instead of whole milk we substituted \n2 cups of whole milk and 2 T of white vinegar (allow to sit for 10 minutes, it's a buttermilk alternative).  We used 1 T cinnamon and 1 T pumpkin spice for the spices.  Instead of 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, we used 1 C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all-purpose.  The next time we make these, we'll substitute white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.  These came out fluffy, moist and slightly sweet.  These made 10 Belgium waffles, we froze the left-overs and will have a quick treat another day.  Thank you again Jeanette.\nUpdate- March 2013:  We are still making these, in fact they are our go to Belgium waffle batter.  We sometimes use pureed roasted sweet potato (and if the puree is a little less than 1 cup, we add a mashed banana to make up the difference).  Today our big change was using sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk- it made it a little more moist, but delicious!  Thank you again Jeanette.",
