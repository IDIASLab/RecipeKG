Very elegant and also very versatile. Great as lettuce wraps in a whole grain wrap stuffed in a tomato you name it! I used butter lettuce because that's what I had on hand and I also used about half the amount of red onion. I served it over 4 lettuce leaves for a delicious lunch. I did find that this made 4 very small servings...to me this was more like 2-3 servings if you're having it as a main meal. Also this makes a lot of balsamic syrup. I halved the syrup ingredients and still had plenty. I think a light drizzle is all that's needed so as to not overpower the other ingredients. The sunflower seeds are a fantastic touch so don't leave them out! This one's a keeper and I'll be making it often! Next time I might also use a bit more capers since I really like them.",

I increased the dressing as well but used lime juice instead as I didn't have a lemon. I served it on a bed of spinach with hard boiled eggs on the side. This was a light lunch for the 4 of us. I will definitely make this again... it's healthy and has very nice flavours and presentation. I'd add the additional can of tuna next time as well; the extra tuna seemed right proportionally and made it go a little further.",
