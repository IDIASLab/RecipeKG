It looked horrible after baking it took forever to bake I baked it for over 40 mins at the recommended temp to give up and finally pull it out of the oven cause it was so runny looking in the middle.... and what is with the crumb topping on top it does nothing for the pie. Maybe if you used graham crackers or something instead of plain bread crumbs? The flavor wasnt even right I was embarrassed to serve this just by the look of it but even more so that I wasted money on the ingredients of this and my time and it tasted \"off\". I used all fresh ingredients and it was bland and lifeless. I have had 99% success with every recipe I have tried on this site but this was the worst.",

We could taste the flour in the sour cream mixture the crumb topping should be eliminated or replaced with a better crumb mixture the flavor was bland and there needs to be more sugar.

In the berries I'd add 2T sugar and 1T cornstarch and wouldn't bother with a crumble topping.",
