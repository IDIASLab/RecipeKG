                "reviewBody": "Made this with a few modifications. I used two parsnips (one big one small) three skinny carrots and one huge sweet potato. I sliced and cubed them to relatively the same size and let boil for 15 minutes to be sure they were cooked through. I downsized the mushrooms to about a cup (fianc\u00e9 isn't a big fan of the 'shrooms) and used \"mignon\" leeks (pre-packaged leeks that are already trimmed down to the white) which I thinly sliced. Saut\u00e9ed in butter-flavoured margarine; added the flour and cooked until almost brown (I was afraid it would burn if I let it get brown) and poured in a cup of water/a tablespoon of chicken soup base as well as half a cup of white wine/a tablespoon of chicken soup base. Whisked it all in and let it thicken. Tossed in the other vegetables and coated them in the sauce. I used a 9-inch deep dish pie pan (it's the only pie pan I own). I used a little less baking mix simply because my pan was smaller than the one used by the recipe submitter. I did not scoop the mixture over the vegetables; I instead poured it all over the top and spread it as thin as possible leaving a few spots uncovered to let the steam seep out of the pie. I like that this savoury pie is almost crust-less with just a light biscuit-like topping (saving on calories!). I thought making little blind spots to let the steam seep out of the pie would work however it didn t as there is some leakage. Oh well that s my mistake and gives me a reason to clean the oven lol!",

I used a few different vegetables and added some green beans for color but you could do any vegetable combination and this would work. The parsnips however add a really nice flavor to the mix. I have an abundance of parsley so I used that instead of thyme adding it to the roux as well as the biscuit mix. Since I'm stubborn and try to make everything from scratch I just used a standard drop biscuit dough using half whole wheat half all purpose flour. No matter what changes or substitutions you make this is a comfort food recipe to follow.",
