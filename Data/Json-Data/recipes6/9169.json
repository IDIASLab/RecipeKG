The biggest problem I have stumbled upon in my sourdough journey is the wastefulness of the discard part of all recipes, and with the lack of resources recently it's more important than ever to reuse the discard starter. In the spirit of zero waste, tonight I am testing a sourdough discard recipe.",

I made a couple modifications, as I don't have a bread basket or dutch oven:. after kneading, I placed the doughin a clean, lightly oiled bowl to rise.  I formed the loaf on well floured parchment, and let that rise while the oven preheats to 450, with a cookie sheet placed inside. When at temp, I place the loaf on the cookie sheet, throw a hand full of ice in the bottom of the oven, and bake for 15 min.  Turn the pan, and bake for an additional 15-20 min.  I'm not sure if I'd be able to tell the difference between this and my full sourdough, and it's so nice to use the discard, and to be able to bake whenever, without regard for feeding schedule!",
