                "reviewBody": "These bars were quite tasty. They reminded me of a square form of an apple crumble pie. I am in the habit of lightening all recipes up so I did do that to this one with good results. I made my own mock apple butter. Most have tons of sugar. Although I have not seen the Musselman's suggested yet. I used 2 4oz cups of unsweetened organic applesauce 2 Tblsp plus 2 tsp of maple syrup and 1 tsp of apple pie spice. I microwaved it 2 1/2 minutes in my small microwave stirring half way through. When it cooled it down it was plenty thick to use. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup lightly packed and they were still quite sweet to me. I also used half all purpose flour and half white whole wheat and subbed half of the butter with safflower oil. I decided to use softened butter instead of melted. I think that made it hold together better. I couldn't understand why the directions would call for spraying the pan and then lining with foil. I always line with foil and then spray with Baker's Joy to avoid cleaning a pan. I put closer to 2/3 of the crumble mixture on the bottom for stability and ease of cutting. My bars took closer to the 30 minute time to bake. When done I let them near completely cooling before cutting. The foil lifted right out of the pan and off the sides of the bar making them easy to cut. This is more of a plated bar recipe as it is very crumbly. I got 12 bars at 192 each made as above.",
