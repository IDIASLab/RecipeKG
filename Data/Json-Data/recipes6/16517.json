I was in an experimental mood and scaled this recipe way down just so I could \"taste\" and fiddle around with this recipe. I am very glad I did. This basic vanilla pudding is just as tasty as the popular cook & serve boxed kind. Also, I spooned a small amount into a smaller dish and sprinkled a bit of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa into it. I kept adjusting until I found just the right color and taste, and BINGO: delicious chocolate pudding suitable as is or for a pie. I'm looking forward to adding a variety of different ingredients for a wider range of spectacular desserts! Thanks a lot!!",

At first it is really sweet the cream, but once it is 'aged' in the fridge for at least 2 - 3 days, it really does taste like the cream filling found in the Italian Bakery cakes.  I was impressed.  Mind you, I only discovered this cause I ended up with too much cream filling that I was using for a cake.  Very impressed by discovery.",

I was only making one pie and fearing that it would end up like my previous recipe, I scaled this one down from 16 serving to 4, and it made MORE than enough for one pie, so even if you cut this in half, you'll have some left over (which isn't a bad thing because it is fantastic). I did change the process of cooking like a few others have noted to avoid lumps: \n-First mix milk, sugar, cornstarch & salt in pan first, then bring to boil. This will prevent lumps from forming. The cornstarch and sugar need to dissolve before heat is brought into the picture. \n-Then whisk eggs in a bowl, temper (this means to add some of the hot liquid to the eggs so they do not cook to fast when adding to the whole pan and you don't end up with scrambled eggs in your pie)with milk mixture.\n-Add in a steady stream to milk mixture and continue cooking for 5 minutes. \n-Remove from heat and add butter and vanilla.\n-Let cool before putting in pie crust, cover with plastic wrap (to avoid a film from forming over the top) and let set for a few hours or overnight in refrigerator.",
