For the handle I wanted to use several red licorice ropes but I accidentally picked up the wrong kind at the store. I was in a bit of a crunch time wise so this idea will have to wait until next year. Instead I laid out a piece of rose-colored saran wrap laid a piece of tin foil the same size on top of it then rolled the two together. The handle was pretty and strong; the ends went right down into the sides of the cake. The coconut was a lot less messy than I thought it would be to color and it looked great in and around the cake! I filled the middle of the \"basket\" with some of the coconut grass and then put in some chocolates and jelly beans. Thanks for a terrific idea that will likely be a new tradition!",

I made this cake with an Almond Bundt cake and Whipped Cream-Cream Cheese frosting both from this site. I baked it in a bundt pan. When cooled I frosted and filled the whole with green tinted coconut and placed a variety of Easter candy in the middle. Instead of making a handle out of foil which does not bend nicely I used floral wrapped wire sticks and curved them gently around a round object. Then I wrapped with bright colored ribbons and made two bows of matching but different ribbons. Everyone thought I really fussed with the cake when in actually it was very easy. It looked very festive with my Easter meal. I will definitely do this again. Picture to be posted soon. Thanks for sharing.",

I have a tip though when cutting out the center use the smallest bowl or big tea cup push it down in the middle pull it out it is easier then trying to make it even with a knife. It is also a good small dessert for later. Don't go to heavy with the coconut. Overall it was fun and good tasting. Try it you will love it. GOOD LUCK",
