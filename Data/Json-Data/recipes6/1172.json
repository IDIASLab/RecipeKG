Instead of 2 teaspoons salt, I would suggest stating with 1/2 teaspoon, tasting, and adding more if you feel the sauce needs it.  The pumpkin sauce was a little thick, and I really should thinned it out with additional milk, and would do that if I make it again.  My husband who\u2019s not a picky eater just couldn\u2019t get into pumpkin ravioli (he rated it 3 stars), I thought it was OK (3-1/2 stars) but not sure I\u2019d make it again.  It certainly is quick and easy to make, but it is non tradiitonal for ravioli, not that that\u2019s a bad thing either.",
