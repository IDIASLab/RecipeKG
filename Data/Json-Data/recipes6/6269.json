Depending on whom you talk to, this cheese-stuffed burger is either called a \"Juicy Lucy,\" or a \"Jucy Lucy.\" That's because two restaurants in Minneapolis claim to have invented it, and they spell it differently. Make sure you thoroughly and thoughtfully press the edges of the two patties together to seal in the cheese stuffing, which keeps the meat juicier. Spread your favorite burger sauce over the bun.",
