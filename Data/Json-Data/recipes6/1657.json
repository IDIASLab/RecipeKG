As a reviewer suggested I served it with the pecan brown rice on this site and I could have paid 20 for this dish. I used frozen sea scallops and it was delightful. I'll try w/ fresh scallops but I truly can't imagine it being any better. A real keeper. I only used 3/4 lb. of scallops for the two of us but kept sauce ingredients the same and so glad we had the extra sauce delish! Thank you so much for this recipe it will be used often. It probably would be good w/ chicken also.",
