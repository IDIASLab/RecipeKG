I took the advice of some and cut down the brown sugar but I think I will follow the recipe exact next time (we like rich desserts). I found the best way to do the crust was cut up the cold butter then mix it up with my hands. For those who say it was a gooey mess then I think they just didn't bake it long enough. They should come out of the pan just like a bar cookie. I will definately make these over the holidays.",
