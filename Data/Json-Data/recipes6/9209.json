Also deglaze your fry pan with 1/2 cup  of white wine and then pop the entire meal into the oven and cook on 325 for an hour. Fall off the bone tasty.",

Just boil some potatoes and serve with the sauce. This is a truly delicious dinner. I think dried or fresh thyme could be used and will be just as awesome as it it. Will make it again. Have some crusty bread to eat the remnants of sauce. Update: If you want to add some richness and body to the sauce, before adding the garlic and mushrooms, try this:  add about 2tsps of white wine, deglaze the pan, and let the wine dissipate before adding the garlic and mushrooms.
