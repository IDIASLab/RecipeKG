I substituted fresh blueberries for the raisins and it turned out GREAT! I received many compliments and was asked twice for the recipe. Be aware though that the dough is more like a sugar cookie rather than a cake batter. Don't let this bother you it was very moist. Even my kids liked it and asked if I could make another one tomorrow!",
