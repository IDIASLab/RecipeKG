I followed this recipe exactly the first time. The second time I meant to follow it exactly because it was wonderful, but accidentally put in a whole cup of oatmeal rather than 3/4. It still turned out to be great. You will receive lots of compliments if you bake this dish. :) I used a 9\" x 13\" square dish rather than a round one.   Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Roxanne!",
