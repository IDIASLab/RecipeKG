These were excellent - made them for snack at my son's kindergarden and even the kids loved them!",

I wasn't in the mood for muffins, so I baked this in a 9 X 5 inch loaf pan.  It worked really well.  This bread was a wonderful treat for breakfast, toasted and spread with some homemade strawberry butter (1 tsp confectioners sugar, 3 strawberries, and 1 stick room temp butter combined in blender or food processor until smooth).  Heavenly!!  This is a really great way to use up strawberries that need to be used before going bad.  I highly recommend this one!!  Hope you like it as much as I did...",
