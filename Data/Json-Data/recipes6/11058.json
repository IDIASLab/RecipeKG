A good rule of thumb is to never try out a new recipe on guests, but this was a real winner. It is easy to whip up, with common pantry ingredients.  Deliciously moist and chocolaty, this is very similar to the wildly popular \"Black Magic Cake\" on this site - but doesn't require the buttermilk.  I made this as the recipe directed, using a full teaspoon of salt for the \"pinch\" called for.  I frosted it with Chocolate Frosting II, submitted by LUV2DY4. Good, old-fashioned homestyle chocolate cake.",

It was FANTASTIC, the coffee made the difference, really good flavor.  I used decaf, and margerine instead of the oil, and through in some imitation rum to both the batter and buttercream (chocolate) icing.  Saved the day!!",

It is everything that your grandma's chocolate cake brings to mind. I needed to serve several people, so I baked it in a 15\"X10\" jelly roll pan or cookie sheet, and was surprised that there was too much batter to fit. I baked the remainder as 6 cupcakes. The sheet cake was baked to perfection in 22 minutes, the cupcakes in 18. Topped both the cake and cupcakes with a glossy cross between a glaze and a frosting, consisting of 4 Tb cocoa, 1/2 a stick of butter and 6 Tb milk heated just until boiling, then combined with 4 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla, all poured over the hot cakes. Next time I need a big cake, I'll put all of it into an 11\"X17\" jelly roll pan, and it will fit the full recipe perfectly. Thank you for a keeper that I'll turn to again and again.",

My kids ALWAYS request it (with homemade cocoa icing) for every birthday.  I've made it over and over, and only once did it \"fall\", and that was when I switched brands of flour.  Needless to say, I ditched that flour and went back to my old brand.  Perfect chocolate cake!",

UK cup measurements are different to US measurements so I keep a conversion chart I printed off allrecipes taped to the inside of one of my cupboards. Anyway the kids were squabbling behind me and I was distracted and read the conversion chart wrong and put too much oil in. Despite this still turned out to be the best chocolate cake I've made.
