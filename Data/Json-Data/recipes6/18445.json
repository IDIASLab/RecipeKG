To make a GREAT lemon drop martini, you need to first fill your mixing tin with 8 oz of ice, you need 2 oz. of (preferrably) citrus vodka, squeeze 2 lemon wedges for natural juice and drop wedges into shaker, add 1/2 oz. of cointreu or another citrus liquer, 1 oz. of lemon juice, and then 2 individual packets or 3 teaspoons of sugar. The trick to getting a PERFECT lemon drop is to shake the tin a lot, you want to mix the sugar up into the liquid, not having it settle at the bottom of the tin. Strain the ice and lemon wedges and enjoy a PERFECT lemon drop. My recipe will deffinitely impress your guests and keep everyone having an awesome time. Good luck...",

Obviously a good vodka is key - I prefer belvedere. Fine baking sugar disolves very quickly in the martinin shaker when you make tis as well. I like to cut lemon wedges and then coat them in sugar so people can bite into them after they take a drink. Thanks!",
