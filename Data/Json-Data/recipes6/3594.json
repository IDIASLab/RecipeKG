The sugar helps create a caramelized effect. I also used Guinness Stout which help add the richness of the flavor.",

The corned beef was tender, but firm which I liked. It was from Costco and they have a good, lean beef. I think 5 minutes for matchstick sized carrots, quartered small red potatoes, bite-sized onions and coarsely chopped cabbage is too long. I cut my carrots, onions, and celery in large chunks. Left the potatoes in their golf-ball size, and cut the cabbage in four wedges. The cabbage, celery and onions came out overcooked, but the root veggies were fine. I guess it's a matter of preference. If I make this next time, I'll cook the veggies for three minutes and cook the cabbage on the stove.",
