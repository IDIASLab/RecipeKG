Couple of tips for this recipes: \r\n1)Do not \"overub-in\" the butter.  Yes! please use butter for the flavour, instead of the margarine.\r\n2)Make sure everything is extremely cold.\r\n3)Do not knead the dough for more than 8-10 times, even when there are crumbs left behind, just pat them onto the dough when you shape it out on the cookie sheet.\r\n4)Instead of cream of tartar and baking soda, add 2 tsps of baking powder.\r\nI made many many scones before, but never ever cut any of them into circles as suggested in recipes.  Instead roll the dough out into a 6\" circle and scour the circle into 6 triangles is my favourite method.",

I had planned to add some blueberries but when I saw the dough was pretty dense I was afraid they would get all broken up if I tried to mix them in. I also decided to cut the scones into triangles. I wasn't sure how much the scones would spread as they baked and since they hardly spread at all my triangles were too small.

If you want these to rise and be sure to use self-rising flour vs. all-purpose (still add the same amounts of cream of tartar baking soda and salt). I used light butter instead of margarine. If you want to make things easier freeze the butter and then grate it with a cheese grater into the flour mixture. Always use half and half. You don't have to knead the dough very much and if you're not good at it just spoon the mixture onto the parchment paper. They'll bake up just like biscuits.",
