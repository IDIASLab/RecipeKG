To me, what it now boils down to is this: if it's plain, it's a bread or muffin, if you frost it, it's cake. So I made this CAKE into cupcakes, baking them at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes.  I frosted them with \"Maple Icing,\" also from this site.  And they were perfect - pretty, moist, delicious and spiced very similarly to a pumpkin pie.  Nice recipe.",

Slight revisions:  I use butter, add 1 tsp of vanilla, cut down the sugar to about 1 c white and 3/4 c brown. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the other spices when I ran out of ginger. I've made it twice with a cream cheese filling (blending together 8 oz cream cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 sugar)-- Put about half of the batter into the bundt pan, pour in the cream cheese filling evenly on top of that, top with remaining cake batter, bake for an hour. Cool and dust generously with powdered sugar. Delicious.",

I was surprised that someone said this cake was bland. Perhaps their spices are outdated. With the pumpkin and spices it's hardly lacking in flavor.
