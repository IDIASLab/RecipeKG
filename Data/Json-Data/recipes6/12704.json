Also I added two small packages of pistachio pudding mix and 1/2 cup chopped pistachios.  The extra butter made them easier to roll and not at all sticky. The extra pudding mix added a lot of flavor and color. And the suggestion to use almond extract was an excellent choice however I used a bit more then suggested. I melted the chocolate in the microwave and used a wooden skewer to drizzle the chocolate. They were a hit. I made many delicious cookies this year however these were everyone's favorite by far",

The dough is VERY sticky and difficult to work with even when cooled as directed--I found that simply wetting my hands with water helped me to achieve a slick little ball easily--this worked out better than fingers because these are so cakey and delicate that they have the potential to break. I also used more than the recommended chocolate--excellent. These also have a hint of a salty flavor which perfects the pistachio flavor. We will put these on our Christmas cookie platter every year from now on!",
