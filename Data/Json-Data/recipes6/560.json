It was enough inspiration to come up with this delicious recipe for our cook-out this afternoon! I have two boys and a daycare and would recommend this recipe as super-simple to make with kids. Children love chopping apples (even littles can do this with a butter knife) and mixing the dressing. I used &frac34; of my dressing and reserved the rest to use as fruit dip later.",

I only used Winesap apples a tart red/green apple for the sweet/tart contrast. I used black grapes and doubled the cranberries (mixed in) for the color. I loved the salad. The leftovers were my lunch for 2 days after our Thanksgiving dinner.",
