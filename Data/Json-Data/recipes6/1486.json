I had all the ingredients in the house, so it is pantry friendly.  I used an small rectangular pan and followed the recipe exactly.  This is outstanding.  Definitely let it cool a bit.  It is too hot to eat when it comes out of the oven; believe me, I tried and it doesn't taste as sweet when it is that hot.  \n\nThe sugar in my opinion makes it just sweet enough and if my blueberries had been sweeter, it would have been as well.  Even though the coconut was not sweetened, it just gives that special taste.  If I would change anything, I would add some nuts, but it didn't need a thing.  Perfect for company in the winter and I could see apples tasting great or even bananas.  I will make this often.",
