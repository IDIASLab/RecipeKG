I used two packages of raspberry Jell-O and one package of strawberry Jell-O and cut the sugar back to about 2 cups -- and it was still plenty sweet. I divided the mixture (minus the ginger ale) into three gallon ziplock freezer bags and froze them. They were mostly hard but not totally frozen about 15 hours after I put them in the freezer and when I mixed it with the ginger ale (I used 1 bottle of ginger ale per bag of Jell-O mixture) it came out nice and slushy! The bride loved it so much she asked for the recipe and is using it for her wedding reception!",

Once somewhat thawed it made a slushy punch which had a different and great consistency than watery punch. (Maybe because of the jello?!) A winner!",

I do think I will cut back on the sugar next time as it is almost too sweet with the jello sugar and ginger ale all sweet. I put it in quart sized zip lock bags and froze them until the event and then just cut the bags and poured the ginger ale over them. When one flavor was gone we went to another. We stored them in a cooler so they started getting softer and easy to break up in the punch bowl. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.",

A few notes: This makes 40 servings not ounces (I misunderstood and made way too much punch!); the juice mixture refrigerates just fine if you don't want to/can't freeze the whole thing; and this is very sweet - now that we are drinking leftovers I think you could safely use sugar-free gelatin and/or halve the sugar.",

It's more trouble than some other punch recipes but that's primarily because of the volume of liquid you're working with (to mix as well as to freeze.) But I've served it three times now and guests always rave. Freezing tip: use casserole/baking pans lined with foil so you can lift out the frozen slabs easily to chop them into your punch bowl. Or ice cube trays or muffin pans (unlined) eliminate the need to chop in the first place. (But boy you'd need a lot of them!)",
