After trying this, I've now realized it goes into the dough--you need 1 1/4 cups of liquid, and the egg is the 1/4 cup.  I made this in the bread machine--more out of laziness and wanting to multitask than anything else--and forgot to check it until it was done.  That's when I realized it needed more liquid.  No big; I just added in liquid (put in water bc I wasn't thinking) and let it go again.  This made for a light, quick pizza dough that is perfect for a regular thick crust.  If you like thin crust, you'd probably want to make two crusts out of it.  Made it for D's Taco Pizza recipe and it worked well.  thanks for the recipe!",

Turns out, I'm glad I didn't.  The egg makes the dough too cakeish.  I wanted a lighter dough.  I substituted about a quarter cup of hot tap water.  The step I liked was stirring the oil and flour together.  It seems to lighten the crust.  I also didn't knead it but about two minutes.  The more you knead it, the smaller and more uniform the holes in the crust made by the yeast are.  I wanted more variation.  It was easily elastic enough.  It turned out just right as far as texture goes.  Next time I'll add a bit more salt.  I also don't understand people who want tons of flavor in the crust.  Isn't that what you put the stuff on top for?",

After I had started, I remembered that I didn't have any eggs so I used a suggestion from a couple reviews that said to use 1/4 cup of hot water. The dough rose and rolled quite well. I have tried a few other recipes and they were flavorless so I added a healthy sprinkle of Johnny's Garlic Spread & Seasoning to it. It smelled amazing while it was cooking. The recipe itself is missing the instructions on how to cook it once the dough is complete. I rolled mine fairly thin, so I baked it at 425\u00b0 for 15 minutes. The crust is nice and golden.
