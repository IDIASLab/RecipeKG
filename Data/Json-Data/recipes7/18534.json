Took 18 minutes for them to finally start to turn to a golden brown. They were tasty but the marshmallows melted and oozed out of most of the cookies causing that part of the cookie to be flat and taffy-like sticking to our teeth. Maybe adding the marshmallows to the top of the cookies during the last 4-5 minute bake time might solve this.",
