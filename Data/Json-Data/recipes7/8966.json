        "description": "With this wonderful cool weather arriving this recipe is a perfect hearty Irish comfort food. After cooking and enjoying the great flavors, it reminded me and brought back warm thoughts of the mutton stew I had in Dublin, Ireland last year! Irish stew, is traditionally made of lamb or mutton, potatoes, onions, and parsley. But I am using beef. Original Irish stew was a thick and hearty meal, meant to keep a body warm and on your feet for many hours of hard work.",

First off, it sure takes a LOT more than the specified amount of flour and oil to brown that much meat.  I used cubed London Broil and I doubled the batch.  Additionally, as there wasn't much liquid specified, I added several cups of beef broth.  It would have been horribly dry without that.  I used a crock pot instead of a dutch oven which I don't own.  Guinness wasn't available so I used Deschutes black butte porter - it has a stronger flavor and color than Guinness.  I also don't peel potatoes - carpal tunnel syndrome is a royal pain.  The way I did it turned out quite nicely.  It's keeping well for leftovers though I wouldn't take a chance on freezing it as it would likely destroy the texture of the spuds.",

I cut my potatoes and carrots in larger chunks and added them after 1 1/2 hrs of simmering beef because they take longer to cook than smaller pieces. I think the directions mean cover \"skillet\" instead of \"dutch oven\" in step five and then add everything to beef in dutch oven in step six. At least that's the way I made it and it turned out great. I also added extra sprig of fresh thyme and a sprig of rosemary. I think you could substitute tsp of thyme and rosemary if fresh not on hand. Add salt and pepper to taste. I also think this would be a good slow cooker recipe. Gave this to friends for a thank you gift and they raved about it.",

I think the secret is to use beef broth for most of the liquid, and just one bottle of Guiness added for the last part of the cooking process, so it doesn't get too bitter.  Also, they didn't have very many potatoes IN the stew. What they did there was have mashed potatoes on top of the stew, so I only put in one potato for thickening in the stew, and just make mashed potatoes for the top now and serve the stew with a scoop of mashed on top, which has been a big hit with the family. Everything else is about the same as this recipe, but I do mine in a crock pot.",

Then in the flour salt cayenne and pepper mixture ( needed way more than stated in the recipe so just remade each time needed) browned beef in the skillet only added one FINELY chopped onion with five or six cloves of garlic ( my boyfriend hates onions) then cooked in a crock pot. Let sit on low for two hours. Then added Half a box of Campbell's chicken broth. One beef cube crushed carrots and potatoes a sprinkle of chili flakes. Then turned the crock pot to high. Cooked for two more hours stirring occasionally. Added canned peas cooked for one more hour. Made tea biscuits for mopping up the delicious gravy. Will make this again for sure!!",

Also in place of straight Cayenne I used Penzey's Black & Red Spice (a blend of hot Cayenne and black pepper). Admittedly I paired this recipe down sort of off the cuff as we made it with 1.2# of meat - and I just eye balled all the rest of the ingredients. We used about 1 1/2 cans of Guinness (14.9 oz cans) and it filled our Lodge 10\" Dutch Oven. We really liked this - and in hindsight the directions - 1 thru 4 where you mix the tomato paste with water and simmer the onions really is what helped make this so flavorful. Don't skip that step. That being said next time I might add a whole variety of different root vegetables and try other beers or maybe dark red wines for flavor.",

Overall, the finished product was great. And the longer it cooked, the better it was. I set the slow cooker on high for  hours. Potatoes were still a little firm. After the 4 hours, the cooker automatically switched to warm. Another 45 minutes and it hit perfection. The sauce thickened and the meat was fork tender.. I served it",
