I substituted cooking sherry for the red wine and omitted the white sugar completely. I forgot to reduce the tomato paste by two-thirds and mixed the entire 6 oz can of tomato paste into 4 cups of water. The result was a thicker flavorful base! Did not miss the omitted sugar and skipped the cornstarch step. Perfect consistency without having to thicken it at the end. End result...I should have prepared the full recipe and tripled the tomato sauce as my other half finished off the entire batch at once. No leftovers:(",

I liked the flavor in this and I liked that it was tomato based instead of beef broth. Mine was more of a soup consistency than stew which is what I like and obviously it would have been a lot thicker if I would have used 4 pounds of meat but I'll stick to 2. What I also liked is that if you make as directed, none of the vegetables get overcooked. Every stew I've ever had the vegetables are overcooked and mushy but not this recipe. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!",

The potatoes weren't done in the amout of time it said in the recipe, so if you make this, keep that in mind. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this recipe. You may like it. I will say the beef stew meat did have excellent flavor and was tender when the stew was done. I do thank you for the recipe.",
