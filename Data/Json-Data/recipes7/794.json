                "reviewBody": "Ok so I made so many changes but it turned out great so I will share them all. First for the cake I used 1/2 cup of un-diluted frozen orange juice concentrate. I creamed that in with the butter sugar and eggs. I also added a couple tsps of vanilla at this point. I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup because I used frozen cranberrys as the fruit and as we all know they can be VERY tart. I used sour cream instead of yogurt because it's all I had on hand. Finally I stired the frozen cranberrys (About 1 cup) right in to the batter. I greased a spring form pan and poured the batter into it. I creamed the cream cheese mixture together as directed and poured that over the batter. I added some nutmeg and probably twice as much butter as called for to the crumb topping and sprinkled that on the top. (Note: next time I make it I will deffinetly use white sugar instead of brown for the crumb topping) I baked it at 350 for probably 45-60 mins. Once out of the oven let cool for at least an hour before removing the outer part of the spring form pan if you choose to use it. It works wonderfuly but needs time to set. Anyway turned out FAB! Served it with some good vanilla ice cream and every one LOVED it! Play with this recipe to make it work for you. It's deffinetly worth it!:)",

It wasn't bland so much as it was crusty and I had thought it would be cakey. The cream cheese filling was good and it did set as it cooled not runny at all in fact I could have cooked it less and it would have been fine. The crumb topping wasn't very crumbly; the butter just absorbed the flour until it was a paste. Cinnamon and brown sugar were not the right offsets to the flavor of the cream cheese. I would instead sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar a la Entenmenns cream cheese coffee cake. I may try the filling with another coffee cake recipe or i will just keep looking.",

The crumble topping is delicious but burns very easily so be careful. The cream cheese layer is wonderful and almost makes the cake taste like a chess square. A note about the cake batter: it will be very thick and seem almost too dry when you are mixing it but will bake up nicely. The cake itself is moist when it is served hot but does dry out quickly. That's OK just serve it with coffee!",

I always think coffeecake relies too much on the topping for flavor so I always add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and I did one and half on the cheese filling with chocolate chips on one side and cherry preserves on the other. Note about preserves - the amount listed may not provide much flavor. I would suggest fruit instead frozen fresh or re-hydrated. Ditto other's comments on the topping burning.
