I lined a mini muffin pan with liners and added just enough crushed oreos (12 regular sized crushed in a ziploc bag with a rolling pin) to cover the bottom. I halved the filling and it made just enough to fill all 24 liners to the top. I added a splash of vanilla to the filling as well and only cooked it for about 12 minutes or until it was almost set. I topped them off with one mini oreo each and it took almost the whole box of Snack Packs to do the job as each baggie only had about 9 cookies in it:( overall i was really pleased with how they turned out. Can't wait to eat them this weekend at a friend's party!",

In fact it was just as crunchy and hard after baking as it was before baking. Next time I will try soaking the cookies in milk or maybe even warm coffee (if serving to adults) to see if this makes a difference. The alternative would be to use Oreo crumbs and make your own crust. Another lesson learned is go ahead and fill the cupcake liner with batter almost until the top. I filled mine 2/3 of the way and the batter did not rise as much as I would have liked.",

I was done with this in no time. Drop the cookie, fill the cups. And to me the cookies aren't too hard. They're not super soft, but they're not hard like they were just taken out of the package, either. I didn't mess with melting chocolate or cool whip. I just crushed some oreos on the batter. I'm docking this because the cheesecake part, which is pretty much the most important part, is pretty much flavorless. It needs something. Vanilla? I'll keep the oreo bottom idea, but find a different cheesecake recipe to fill it with.",

Remember cheesecake doesn t really rise so fill your cups pretty full. After reading other reviews I was expecting the cookie to be extremely hard. I dont know if it was because I used generic oreos or if it was because I made them the night before but my cookie was very soft. Also to simplify the process even more I used Smucher s Magic Shell ice cream topping for the chocolate drizzle. After I baked them I let them set for about 10mins drizzled the MagicShell on top then refrigerated overnight. Topping looked just as good and a lot less work. Thanks for the recipe!",

This it the type of cheesecake that is thick and creamy not that light fluffy. i made these for my boyfriend when he came over for dinner and mind you he is just like a critic he absolutly loved them.
