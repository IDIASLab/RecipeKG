I ended up having to make more frosting because I didn't have quite enough. That might have been because I baked a 9\" round and not 8\". My husband made a special trip to my workplace at lunch just so he could get a piece. He said he knew it would be good because he saw what went into it. I did not have any problem with the pur\u00e9e sinking to the bottom of the cake. It is a keeper!",

By that I mean it said to add the confectioner's sugar into the cream cheese and chocolate mix but didn't tell you to take it off the heat so I added everything thinking I was supposed to let it all melt together...I took it off to let it cool like instructed and within 10 minutes it was literally rock hard very hard and I knew there was no way I'd be able to frost with it. So unfortunately all that icing had to be thrown away and I had to make another trip to the store to get more sugar. All that said it is still pretty tasty but I can't eat very much of it at one time...I got a moderate slice and could only eat about half as it's so thick. I probably won't be making this again.",
