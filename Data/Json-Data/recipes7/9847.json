We served it with maple walnut ice cream like suggested and it was perfect! Yum! The only problem I had was the cooking time and temp. I always bake my pies at a higher temp. for the first 15 minutes so I was a little hesitant to cook the pie the whole time at 325. But I did and the pie never browned. The last 5-10 minutes I turned the heat up to 375 so I could brown the top a little bit. Other than that a great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful pie, not too sweet with a full bodied flavor.  I'm cooking at 2800 feet so it took me two or three attempts to adjust the recipe.  The original instructions left me with a watery slurry at the bottom of the pie that soaked the bottom crust; the pie still tasted great but it wasn't very presentable.  In the end I modified the recipe as follows:\n\nI brought the syrup and sugar to a boil and simmered for about 20 minutes.  I also added 1 tbs of flour to aid in the thickening.  I used Braeburn apples and they didn't render very well at the suggested temperatures and time.  So I pre-cooked them in the microwave for 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 minutes until they were still firm but could bend under a slight pressure.  This allowed me to fill the crust with apples more tightly and eliminated the natural voids between slices thus forcing the syrup higher into the pie.  After preparing the syrup and apple slices as above I mixed them together before placing them in the pie.\n\nAt my altitude I still have to cook the pie a bit longer but the end result is a delicious desert (or breakfast depending on your whim).  The apple slices are still reasonably firm and the syrup is distributed through the entire pie.",

I used 5 apples and should have added more. Like several reviewers said I baked it per instructions at 325 degrees. (Most of the other recipes I looked at are 350 and higher) I took the foil off when suggested and baked for another 25 minutes! The crust never browned in any way shape or form. The apples weren't done and there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the pie. All the negative said I think I will try it again with some of the suggestions of the other reviewers. I wonder if there is a difference in the absorption of the syrup being real syrup versus the \"fake\" stuff like Aunt Jemima's.",
