The comments were very useful and so I used 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar, one teaspoon of espresso powder and a pinch of baking soda because I had organic cocoa (not Dutch process).  It's really delicious. I baked it 42 mins per the comments but it could probably be a little less like 35 or so.  It's not too sweet and is really chocolaty. Big recommend.  Only thing I don't know is how to make the powder sugar stay on top as it sinks into the cake.",

As some of the reviews said it needs some extra sugar. The outside burns a little but the inside is fairly good. I would recommend adding a little extra sugar and oil... maybe 1/3 cup of oil and make it 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4. Other than these few things it is a great cake especially for being gluten free and I will probably make this again!:)",
