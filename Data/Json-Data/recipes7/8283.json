The dough did seem a little too soft so I added another 1/2 of flour or enough so that the dough had the consistency of chocolate chip cookie dough. I used a 1 inch scoop which made perfect round cookies (About sixty of them) and they were light buttery and crisp on the edges while still managing to be chewy on the inside. They had the perfect thickness- not too flat. Perfection!!!",
