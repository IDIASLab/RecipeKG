I also added 4c of fat free low sodium chicken broth to this....how else is it a soup if there is no broth or liquid? I did add small diced carrots to the onion and celery and used a frozen bag of red, yellow and green peppers that were sliced, 2 medium zucchini and I added a can of drained and rinsed small white beans. Very hearty and delicious. I ate mine with red hot pepper flakes, pecorino romano and a few crunchy croutons. Thanks!",

The salt in the canned tomatoes and sausage links is more than enough.  I have been using Sprout's sweet Italian sausage links.
