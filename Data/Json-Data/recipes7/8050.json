Creamed the butter & sugar; added the eggs & oil; used 1c buttermilk for the milk/vinegar combo; then the dry ingredients & berries. Sprinkled with a tiny amount of sugar - considering we're dealing with whole wheat. These aren't too wheat-y either - meaning you don't see/taste the whole wheat but it's in there & good for you. Yay! I baked mine at 375 & they were done in 25 mins. Next day: While still very good both type muffins got moist on top. Maybe the 2T oil needs to go? Also these look just like the photo - not all that pretty but they have a \"great personality\"!:D",
