They vary mainly in the veggies included. So it is alright to make changes with the veggies a bit. I prefer more of carrots and potatoes. \n  Hope you find this review useful.",

Then I stir fried the vegetables in a tablespoon of canola oil for a few minutes, before adding the spices. (I didn't have sambar powder, so used garlic chili paste) Next I added the peas, and then some water. I let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes. The peas still came out a little firm, so maybe I should have cooked them a bit while I was cooking the veggies.  I served all over basmati rice. This recipe was OK, but it could have used a few more vegetables in my opinion.",
