I've tried jicama before and thought it was basically tasteless, so I left it out.  Also, I chose to slice rather than chop the vegetables - it seemed to me that chopped radishes might be a bit challenging to spear with your fork! As for the dressing, I knew I'd love it. Fresh and light, not overbearing at all, just how I like it.  A light lemon vinaigrette is my favorite dressing, and adding the fresh basil and dill enhanced it with a fresh, spring-like flavor.  I didn't have pomegranate juice, unfortunately.  I would have liked to try it!  I did not add the water - for my tastes it didn't need it.  I chose this as a main dish salad for Hubs and me (after three days of good ol' Memphis barbecue and side dishes we needed something light and healthy!) so I topped it with pan seared scallops.  Nice salad - just what we were after.  With only two reviews, and none in nearly three years, this is a sadly neglected recipe.",
