No, it\u2019s my hand to mouth problem. I added diced fresh strawberries (dried in paper towels) and more strawberry extract to the frosting. This was really good. I don\u2019t know how long it will keep because it was gone in 2 days...I\u2019m a widow, so yes, I ate the whole thing. Children and grandchildren don\u2019t care for sweets.
