The combination of white and brown sugars with the honey lends to the rich complexity of the sugar profile, and elevates the dish from just another buttery roll, to an inimitable southern comfort. Halve the dough and roll to make a soft and fluffy cinnamon roll base, or sprinkle sugar on top after baking and buttering for a doughnut breakfast alternative.",
