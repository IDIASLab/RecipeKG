Per other reviews I changed the yellow mustard for Dijon mustard and cut down the vinegar to 1/2 cup. Though I only had about 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar so I also put in 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. Omitted the mushrooms and the cheese ( I don't like these things ) used about 1/2 of a large red onion and upped the mandarin oranges to closer to 2 cups. The almonds turned out fantastically and I can see why people say to double those! All the flavors blended well together and it was a light refreshing salad to have. Will definitely be making again now that the weather is warming up! Thanks for a great recipe!",

It's such a great combination of ingredients! The only change I made was using dijon mustard instead of yellow.

Also be sure to get the almonds nice and brown to enjoy their flavor fully - it's the highlight of this salad.",
