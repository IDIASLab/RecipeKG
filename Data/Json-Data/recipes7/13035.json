All you really have to do is boil the milk first (if the milk is too cold, when you add the ginger it'll turn into cheese) and then add the ginger. Add your sweetener and let it cook on medium to low heat for about 5 minutes. And if you want, you can always strain the ginger, but if you like to eat it, you can just leave it in! Lol. :D",

For a kidney friendly drink, I used rice milk and that only needed about 1 minute over medium heat. This helps in reducing nausea when used with non-dairy milks.
