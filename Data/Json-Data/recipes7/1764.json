The only changes I made was I simmered 3 turnips and  reserved 1 cup of the water that I boiled the turnips in, as I wanted to return the taste and nutrients back into the recipe, so I used the water instead of milk.  I have 3 turnips left and I will be making this recipe again very soon!  Thank you.",

Also that \"goo\" was super plain and on top of that basically just tasted like thick milk. I tried to add cheese and salt to try to make it more like a turnip au gratin but then it was just slightly-cheesy-and-more-flavorful-milk \"goo\". Oh well. I tried. As my husband said afterward if there was only about 1/3 of the milk mixture it'd have probably tasted better. One other thing I thought about trying but forgot to mix in to \"rescue\" it-garlic powder. I added it on top at the end and it worked a bit better it would have more so I believe had it been mixed in.",
