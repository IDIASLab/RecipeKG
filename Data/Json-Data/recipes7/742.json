                "reviewBody": "First off let me say this is a decent recipe. For a non-steamed pudding it was nice. Simple relatively quick easy and inexpensive to make. The 10 minute beating of the initial wet ingredients is in my opinion not necessary. 3-5 minutes fo this small amount is acceptable as long as you have a good smooth blend. Also if you do not have (real) maple syrup the average maple flavoured table syrup that the vast majority of us have in the cupboard is fine and can often be flavoured more strongly than real syrup. As to the complaints I read... I do not feel this is a good forum for complaints. If you had issues making the recipe tips or tweaks to make it better then by all means but the out and out complaints and bashing are in poor taste. Especially when wrong. Being an American living in Canada I have a broader view than some. Try and remember the net is not confined to the US. Therefore anything you see online has a very good likelihood of being from elsewhere. Pudding is the British verb used to generically describe dessert (\"If you don't eat your meat you can't have any pudding hoe can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!\"). American style pudding did not become common until around the 1930's. \"Traditional Pudding\" would be a bread or cake like dish more often than not sweet these days. So if you are going to complain please make sure you know what you are speaking of. Thanks for the recipe by the way!",

Other examples are a steamed pudding or a plum pudding or even spoon bread. There is no need to disparage this recipe as two different types of \"puddings\" are being confused by the cooks. Give it a try on its own merit and broaden your culinary knowledge. Then try a traditional steamed pudding for your holiday meal; brought to the table alight - it's stunning.",
