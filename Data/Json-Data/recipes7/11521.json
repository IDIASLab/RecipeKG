When I couldn't find the original recipe from 20+ years ago, I created this simple one with just 2 ingredients. Mixture is very hot, so use care when stirring. Refrigerate leftovers if there are any! Tastes great on toast and English muffins or spoon while warm over ice cream. Blueberries can also be used in place of strawberries.",
