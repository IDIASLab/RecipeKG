It's not my favorite recipe but it is good and a good way to use up that zucchini. Update: I made this recipe a second time. I was a half cup short on flour so I substituted a half cup of oatmeal. It made for a firmer chewier cookie. I like the modification and this cookie is quickly becoming a fall favorite.",
