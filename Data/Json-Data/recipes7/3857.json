I pureed about 2 cups of mixed berries (strawberry blueberry blackberry and raspberry) and added to the champagne mixture as well as 1/4cup more sugar. It turned out great!!! The champagne keeps the sorbet at the perfect consistency and the berries kept the sorbet from tasting overwhelmingly like champagne. We served this in martini glass with a sprig of mint and lemon zest. Very pretty presentation refreshing and delicious! Thank you for sharing!",

Mixed the champagne and sugar in the ice cream maker for 30 min then froze it for a bit in the freezer before scooping. We didn't have strawberries; just chopped some mint and mixed it in with halved/chopped fresh blueberries. As my husband said this will give you \"a head rush and a brain freeze at the same time!\"",
