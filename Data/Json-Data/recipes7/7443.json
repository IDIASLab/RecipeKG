This was perfect for a southern hot dog! I used beef broth instead of water. Since I was using 80/20 beef I just cooked my beef and mashed it, drained it, and added it back to pan. Then added the beef broth as needed. I used Rotel's tomato sauce with diced green chiles (try it if you can still find it). I used a small 8 oz can of the tomato/chile sauce for 1.5 lbs of beef. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. Absolutely yummy! My husband who doesn't eat chili with beans commented that he could eat this chili with just a spoon. BIG statement coming from him! Thanks so much for sharing this one! It's a keeper!!",

It looks a little unappetizing while it simmers, but I allowed it to simmer over a low heat for about an hour and it was worth the wait. Turned out to be a perfect chili dog dinner.  I used oscar meyer classic weiners and Martin's potato roll hotdog buns, with a smear of mayo on the bun, a drizzle of mustard and minced onions on the top.  The way I like my chili dogs. For those who aren't fond of semi sweet chili, you could always eliminate the tiny bit of sugar but I never, ever, review these website recipes unless I follow the complete directions exactly.  I like this one and made a recipe card for it.",

Ketchup has sugar in it as well which will probably be enough sweet for us. I did substitute beef broth for the water. Used 93/7 ground beef and took the advice of others browned the meat and then drained the fat. Even so I followed the recipe exactly other than the method and the beef broth. Now I have a great chili for our hot dogs and it's pretty healthy. The whole family really likes it. Thanks orion3 for sharing.",

Watching fat so I opted to combine the meat & water first - merrily mashing and squishing along so I could achieve that hotdog sauce consistency. Then I drained meat and skimmed the fat from the liquid. Was worried about the sweetness of our ketchup so I only added half of what was called for and stopped after that (would have been way too sweet). Entirely skipped the sugar but added everything else recipe called for. Added back some of the reserved liquid and let it reduce. Finally opted to add a few shakes of Hungarian Hot Paprika for just that little bit of kick. Outstanding and a new hotdog sauce fav! Thanks so much for the recipe!",
