I was unable to properly fill my blintzes as it just ran out the folds.\n\nThe recipe for the crapes was good, I mixed mine by putting it in a bottle and shaking the ever loving *explicit* out of it. Only had flour clumps in the first one that I poured I believe this is an acceptable outcome although that would've been easily avoidable by either mixing it properly or using a filter. \n\nFor the filling I think next time I will be sticking to the regular ricotta and cream cheese mix as this will be far more stable and able to be formed around. I believe for the stuffing presented in this recipe maybe one egg would suffice and much less lemon juice. \n\nWhile I'm not scared of eating raw eggs and a little lemon science basically sanitizes them its still something that should be minded and approached cautiously as if done improperly could lead to some ill effects (pregnant mothers and children please take extra caution).",
