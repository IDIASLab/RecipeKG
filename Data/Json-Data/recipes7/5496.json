I wondered about the coconut/butter crust when I read the recipe but it is Kitchen Approved and submitted by a pastry chef so I figured it must work. It doesn't. There is no structure to the crust at all and it can not support itself or the tiny amount of filling. It just flops over. The filling is refered to as a custard in the recipe instructions. It is more like a very thick sticky curd. Again no structure and a strange consistency. When I attempted to spoon it into the \"crust\" after chilling the entire bowl of curd lifted out with the first spoonful. It is impossible to cut because it sticks to itself. I thought the taste was good but I did not get positive feed back from one person that I served it to. Coconut raspberries and lemon are some of our favorite flavors but I'm not sure if I will attempt to adjust this and try again or not at this point.",

Right now the coconut crust is ready and waiting in the 9\" pie plate - which looks WAY WAY too big for the amount of filling this recipe yielded. 3 Stars for the portions being Way Off! Will likely redo the crust into a flat large tart pan. The color on the filling is beautiful and it did set up nice! Need this for early Passover dinner tonight! Yikes! UPDATE - everyone who likes lemon said they liked it - but it is more of a curd than a custard. Now that I see the picture posted - mine looked the same. Like a runny Lemon Meringue pie. For Passover - no flour - desserts are tough. I cringed watching people take heaping spoonfuls and fwack it onto their plate to get it off the spoon. Won't make this again. 3 Stars because it tasted good! 1 Star for portion sizes (filling vs. crust) being way off. 2 Stars for presentation! Sorry!",
