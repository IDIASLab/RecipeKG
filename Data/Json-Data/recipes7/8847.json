The other listed ingredients were the same. \n\nI love these. I have to smoosh the dough together, as it's dense and can fall apart a little. I like them crunchy, so 10-12 min on 350 is about perfect.\n\nI posted a picture of how mine turn out. They definitely look different than all the others. ;)",
