The dough needed more flour by about a cup in order to make a soft dough that was able to be kneaded and rolled. The glaze needed lots more milk to make it more of a glaze otherwise it's just a rather stiff icing. I added quite a bit of milk and had to keep warming the glaze as I brushed it on the doughnuts to keep it the right consistency. But all in all this was a great recipe and my family loved it.",

Once I got a handle on this sticky dough it turned out airy and fried up crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. I opted for cinnamon sugar and chocolate instead of the suggested glaze. The dough itself is plenty sweet so the glazes and such aren't necessary IMO. This is truly a cake doughnut... the others I've tried have been more like fried scones -- tasty but not very sweet and the perfect canvas for glazes. I'll definitely make these again but I'll leave them naked.",
