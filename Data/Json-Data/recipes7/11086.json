I hope you know what type noodles the recipe calls for because I couldn\u2019t find them and ended up using Trader Joe\u2019s Fresh Rice Noodles which turned to mush.  If I make this again, I\u2019ll use my old stand-by for lo mein, \u201cthick\u201d Barilla spaghetti.  The sauce is good and with the exception of the noodles, we enjoyed this dish.  I did add some snow peas, sliced red bell pepper for color, and a garnish of some chopped peanuts.  In the future, I\u2019ll most likely add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to suit our tastes.",
