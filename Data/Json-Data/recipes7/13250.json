I had some spinach to use up but had no kale on hand so swapped spinach for kale. Didn't have fresh thyme so I used dry. I am not a fan of chevre. That said I had some in the fridge that I needed to use up which is why I chose this particular butternut squash soup recipe. As it turns out I actually really liked how the chevre tasted in this soup! I'm sure the candied bacon would be lovely but I didn't have bacon and honestly the soup was wonderful just as it was. Will definitely make this again!",

I used only 1 (big) onion and also added to the baking dish one chopped celeriac because I had it sitting around. It added such nice flavor! I did not have bacon so I didn't use any and it still turned out super tasty. I didn't know how to define \"1 medium butternut squash\" so I used about 1kg (2lbs) and it was the perfect amount. Luckily I also had kale for that extra bit of fiber and nutrition. Yum!",
