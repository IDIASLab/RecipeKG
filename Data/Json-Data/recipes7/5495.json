I used four very large zucchini to get the 16 cups and did not include some of the center with the seeds. DO NOT stick your hand down in the lime water to push down the zucchini chunks or you will have a shriveled hand (personal experience lol). It doesn't seem like there is enough pickling liquid when you add in the vegetable pieces but during the resting time the liquid will cover the zucchini although I really didn't have enough liquid to completely cover all the pickles in the 8 pint jars I filled. I put about a half cup of pickles in a container in the refrigerator. I went ahead and sealed the jars to leave on the shelf because I don't have room to refrigerate all of them. I doubt anyone who will be gifted with these pickles will have any idea that they are zucchini. Very good. This would be a great project with your kids.",

                "reviewBody": "I think the recipe should read 2 quarts apple cider vinegar not 2 cups. Actually I used 1 quart apple cider vinegar and 1 quart white vinegar. This recipe sounded like the zucchini pickle recipe I got from my mother years ago and made one time 30 years ago but I couldn't find that recipe. But after I mixed up the 2 cups vinegar with the sugar and spices per the recipe I knew this would not be enough syrup to cover and can the pickles so I went on another search for my old recipe - and found it! That recipe was almost the same just some different proportions on the spices but it did call for 2 quarts of vinegar. So using 2 quarts of vinegar the recipe made 10 pints of firmly packed pickles with pickles fully covered in syrup to the tops of the jars -- and there was only 1/2 cup of syrup left over. I then sealed and canned for easy storage in the pantry. If you are interested my old recipe included the 24-hour soaking in pickling lime then a syrup of 2 quarts vinegar 9 cups sugar 1 tsp each of mixed pickling spices whole cloves and celery seed and 1 Tbsp salt. The 24-hour \"resting\" in the syrup followed by the 35-minute simmering times were exactly the same. I also added a few drops of green food coloring to make the pickles a little brighter and prettier in the jars.",
