The texture was different from any other biscuit I've tried or made (somewhat dry and crumbly) as was the flavor. I swear I could taste the dry milk and think these would be better if made with just regular cold fresh milk. In addition my oven temperature is accurate yet I found even at 18 minutes the biscuits were a little overdone. Maybe these \"pioneer biscuits \" as the submitter identified them will appeal to others but unfortunately they will not be a \"Make again!\" for me.",
