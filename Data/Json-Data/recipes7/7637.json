        "description": "This rich and tender sour cream and yeast cookie is delicious and so lovely with its many delicate layers and twists. It is a classic and historic recipe for which many variations can be found. This updated version uses all butter and a food processor for wonderful flavor and ease of mixing. The rich yeast dough actually contains no sugar, but the sweetness and the layering results from well sugaring the dough and work surface, while rolling and folding it several times prior to cutting and shaping the cookies.",

It really didn't puff up all that much for a yeast cookie but maybe that was because this recipe called for no raising of the dough-just put it right in the oven. tip; we used a ruler and a pizza cutter to cut the strips into even 1 inch wide strips and it worked well to keep them a consistent size for even baking. Thank you for a great recipe-we plan to make it again for the holidays.",

It is spectacular and is part of Christmas for me. Her version split the butter into half butter/half shortening (I think because in the 1970s butter was very expensive). I will think of her everytime I make these at Christmas, as will my children.\n\n\nUpdate: I notice  this version says to refigerate for 2 hours. My 50+ year old versions says at least 4 hours and up to 2 days. I think this may be why some had poor outcomes with the recipe. It really needs to solidify and 2 hours is not enough. I use overnight (dough one day, rollout/twisting/baking the next).",

My family members also loved these. I put together the dough last night and baked them this morning following the recipe until I got to the second clump of dough because I used cinnamon sugar for that half. My dough divided into two 1 lb 1 3/8 oz hunks. I do think that when the dough comes from the fridge that it needs to sit for a while before working with it; my first one was much harder to work with than the second one. I rolled it out on a Silpat with a sheet of parchment on top that had been lightly floured. I kept losing track of how many times I turned and folded but that didn't seem to matter much. I used a plastic knife to cut the slices which took about 13 minutes to bake. My family preferred the cinnamon sugar twists but then we are crazy about cinnamon! Thanks for a beautiful new way to enjoy yeast bread!",
