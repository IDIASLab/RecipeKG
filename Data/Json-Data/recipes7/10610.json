That makes it curdle. 2) Coffee brewed at 3x the normal strength is almost as good as espresso. 3) Cocoa tastes better than shaved chocolate. 4) It\u2019s significantly better after 2 days!

I added the 2 Tbs Amaretto to the Marscapone mixture and it had such a lovely texture and soft flavor that I didn't want to mess that up so I added a splash more Amaretto to the coffee. Turned out perfectly, not too strong. I needed more than 1 cup of coffee and had to make more, so it is true that you just dip the ladyfingers fairly quickly. It didn't turn out soggy though, so next time I will probably make 1.5 cups of coffee. I had to use pound cake because my store was out of ladyfingers, and it still turned out great. Will make again and again and thanks to everyone for the tips!",
