I followed the recipe closely except I only added about 30 drops of red food coloring the batter was a nice mahogany color but looked more brown redish brown after baking. DEspite the vinegar /milk (old fashioned buttermilk and all the leavening the pancakes didnt rise incredibly which surprised me. They did rise just not a terrific amount. However the taste and the lightness of the pancake was perfect when eaten. They were delicios and the cream cheese frosting was just the right addition! I would highly recommend these pancakes. They taste very chocolaty and look mouthwatering delicious. We recently had Red Velvet pancakes at a restaurant in our area and these were every bit as good. If you prefer them really red then follow the directions for the food coloring.",

I will say that mixing the batter well then letting it sit for 10-15 would be ideal I made a mistake and didn't mix well enough and had to mix it again. Which of course made them a little flatter than they would have been originally. Overall these had a great flavour! Thanks for a great recipe! Oh and it makes quite a few pancakes normally we double pancake recipes..no need for this one!",
