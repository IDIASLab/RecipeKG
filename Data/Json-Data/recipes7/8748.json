I made a few adjustments based on my preferences; these included adding ~3/4 cup of vinegar and supplementing the onion power with 1/4 a fresh onion finely diced that was saut\u00e9ed for 5 minutes on high with some margarine and brownsugar. My family dislikes the taste of onion, therefore,  to mask the flavor a bit I thought it best to use fresh onion that had been cooked and sweeter a tad. Also instead of adding the cayenne pepper I added generous amounts of both Caribbean Jerk and Old Bay seasoning. Thanks for sharing the recipe it was so simple to make. My changes were only based on my individual taste!",

I simply didn\u2019t like the appearance of that boiled white bacon (just looked like fat) or the texture of it.  Admittedly, this could be just a personal preference issue with me.
