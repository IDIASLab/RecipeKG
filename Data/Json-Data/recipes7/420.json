This is rich, dense and fudgy.  It has a nice, dark flavor.  I have never cared for dark chocolate, but I loved this cake.  I agree with previous reviewers; be careful not to overbake!  I used a 9\" springform pan and set my timer for 35 minutes.  After I first checked it, the toothpick was very wet.  I checked it again every minute or two.  It only took five more minutes for the toothpick to emerge dry!  \n\nI garnished the cake with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and a few strawberry fans.  I served it with whipped cream (non-dairy  whipped topping just wouldn't cut it!) and vanilla bean ice cream.  \n\nI also made the caramel sauce.  It wasn't bad, but it was rather thin.  I wasn't crazy about the taste, but then again, caramel is my favorite thing in the world and I am very particular about it!  I do agree that it may have tasted a little better without the lemon juice.  All that being said, though, I feel that ANY kind of caramel sauce was unnecessary. In my opinion, the sweetness of the caramel sauce competed too much with the rich cake.   Whipped cream and/or a raspberry puree would be more complimentary. \n\nGreat recipe! ",

The top rose and cracked, looked like a brownie.  The edge was a little crumbly but no problem getting it out of the pan, a little low in the middle. I used dark chocolate truffles that were too soft at room temperature to serve and melted them with a few milk chocolate dove candies to harden them a little.  A very dark chocolate drizzle to decorate it.  Rave reviews, no leftovers. Very rich, very dense, very satisfying for the chocoholics -- it will reappear at the office christmas party -- maybe with some peppermint or coffee added ... Yum!",

The only changes I made were to put it in a 9\" springform pan because that is what I had and to bake it 40 minutes instead of 45 minutes but that could just be my oven.  It is very moist and rich tasting and doesn't even need the sauce or whipped cream if you choose not to use it.  If you find that it is in any way dry, then you are either overbeating the mixture or baking it too long.  I believe that using a whisk to incorporate the ingredients makes for less chance of overbeating the cake.",
