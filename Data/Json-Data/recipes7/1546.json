This is low in calories and high vitamins so I didn't feel guilty going back for a little more. This one's a keeper. NOTE: Next time I'd like to add some fresh basil to really drive me crazy.",

We used freshly picked garden tomatoes and flat-leaf parsley from my herb garden. The coffee gave it a smokey flavor. My husband actually asked \"did you smoke these tomatoes first or something?\"! The only thing I substituted was canned condensed milk for the heavy cream. The heavy cream probably would have been a more delicate flavor but I learned the condensed milk trick last year it's cheaper I always have it around the house and then the rest of the cream doesn't go bad because I rarely use it plus it's lower in fat for my family and for recipes like this where it's just a little bit it doesn't make a huge difference.",
