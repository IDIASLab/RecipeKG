I was a bit apprehensive at first becoase of the sugar, but I only used 1/2 of the amount asked for, and a little less of the ketchup as well.  It almost tasted like bbq sauce, I did everything else the same as it asked for in the recipe, very easy, the rabbit by the end is nicely roasted and crispy!!  It was delicious, I served it with rice.  Will make again.",
