Yes there work and I think my dough was a little thick but they are very good and my hubby says its a keeper.

I'd made this recipe a couple of years ago( the last time my plum tree was loaded with fruit) and despite the fact that the dough was tough my family loved the plummy juice interior. So I decided to make them again this year. Well after kneading the dough for close to an hour and still having a tough crumbling mess on my hands I threw it out and found another recipe that used far more potato and much less flour. I had great success with the different dough. I also dont use the bread crumbs instead I saute the butter and brown sugar and then add a good splash of liquor - slivovitz kirsh baileys or kahlua all work great.",
