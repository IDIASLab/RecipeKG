The walnuts really add a nice flavor and texture to it.  I am giving this 4 stars because I feel it needed the extra blueberries.  Thank you Mrs N for sharing your recipe.",

I agree with some some of the reviews. I used 4 TBS of sugar without leveling the measuring spoon and as directed 4 TSP of baking powder with leveing the measuring spoon. I used fresh blueberries probably more than suggested and chopped walnuts probably less than suggested. I had a lemon and put some lemon peel on the top of each muffin before baking as well as sifted some brown sugar on the top of each one. I do not like very sweet muffins but I do suggest adding that extra TBS and more if you like it sweet particularly because the sweetness will counter the bitterness in most blueberries (and lemon peel in my case).",
