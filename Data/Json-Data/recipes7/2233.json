Unfortunately it's not as good as it sounds. I didn't have any cayenne so I used paprika. Don't think it made much of a difference. I thought one cup for breadcrumbs was a bit much but I went against my instinct and used the entire cup. Big mistake because it was a big factor in ruining the recipe. All you could taste were breadcrumbs; seriously it was like eating a mouthful of gravel. Also I used 12 oz of macaroni instead of 8 because it really didn't seem like enough. Either 12 oz is too much or 30 minutes is too long to bake the dish because it was really dry. Could hardly taste the cheese; like I said all you could taste were breadcrumbs. I used a large sweet Mayan onion and I thought it would be too much but after the onion carmelized for 1/2 hour it shrank down to almost nothing. If I make this recipe again (and that's a BIG IF) I will use only 1/2 the breadcrumbs twice the onion; if I use 12 oz mac I will add 6 oz shredded jack and definitely will not bake it for 30 minutes. More like 15 probably. What cheese and onion flavors I did taste underneath all those crumbs did not impress me. I also didn't think the broth was necessary. I would use 1/2 n 1/2 or more milk.",

Definitely not anything like stove-top varieties- in taste or prep. I would say the prep time on here is under-estimated but most of your time will be spent on the roux building it into the cheese sauce. As suggested by other reviewers use HALF the breadcrumbs and don't waste your time on browning them. Also I have made this recipe a few times with cooked and crumbled bacon mixed in before baking- Mouth-gazm! If you're watching your fat or cholesterol then don't do it but otherwise... yum",

Hubby complained that the bread crumbs overpowered/detracted from the mac and cheese and I totally agree. The caramelized onion flavor is nice. I doubled the amount of cheese. Did not taste the mustard or cayenne at all. Previous reviewer is right on target with eliminating the chicken broth and just adding additional milk - I bought a can of chicken broth and used just a partial amount which was a waste of money; I can't see where the chicken broth enhanced the recipe at all. Without the caramelized onions I'd give this 2 stars 3 stars if you halve or delete the bread crumbs - the caramelized onions bring it up another star to a 4.",
