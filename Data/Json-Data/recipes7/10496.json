I was somewhat surprised that the main flavor of these muffins was of the whole wheat flour and the pecans topping each muffin. I didn't really taste the pears and vanilla as much as I would have liked. For me this made 15 muffins. I substituted almond meal for the white flour but couldn't detect that flavor either. Instead of chopped pecans in the muffins I put two or three pecan halves on top - this serves the triple purpose of adding roasted flavor to the pecans decorating the top and allowing non-pecan-lovers to pick them off. Since it was Christmastime I also sprinkled red big-crystal sugar on top which worked very well. I may drizzle some icing over them before I take them to the potluck. If I made these again I think I might add more sugar or maybe buy pear flavoring?",
