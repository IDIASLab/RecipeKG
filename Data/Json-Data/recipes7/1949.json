I know I certainly did! And, I'm glad I read through the reviews, because I cut the sugar in half and that was plenty.  I also opted for olive oil vs. veg. oil and dijon vs. dry mustard. You can definitely play with this to suite your tastes and you won't be disapppointed. I added some dried cranberries to the mix for that little extra something...  Great recipe!",

I made half the recipe of dressing, cutting the sugar back to 1/4 cup, as other reviewers suggested, and I used about 1 T. of finely minced sweet onion instead of the red onion.  I had an apple that had been hanging around way too long and a few dried cranberries left in the bag, so I added those to red leaf lettuce, chopped green onion and toasted almonds for a marvelous salad that hubby and I both really liked.  I'll be making this dressing again for sure!!  Here's a little tip that I've used many times since I like to do as much ahead of time as possible.  Chop apple and toss in a little of the dressing making sure to coat well, then refrigerate until ready to toss the salad.  This keeps the apples from turning brown - works like a charm!",

I don't care for a strong onion flavor so I didn't add them to the blender with the other ingredients. I stirred them into the finished dressing right before service. Worked great.
