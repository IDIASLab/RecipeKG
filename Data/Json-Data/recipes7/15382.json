I reduced the sugar in the cake to 1 1/2 cups and brown sugar in the filling to 3/4 cup. That gave it the perfect amount of sweetness for me. I also used oil and sugar to coat the pan instead of butter and sugar, as the butter and sugar stuck to the pan badly, whereas the oil and sugar did not. My cake also needed 67 minutes to bake through. Great recipe--thanks for sharing!",
