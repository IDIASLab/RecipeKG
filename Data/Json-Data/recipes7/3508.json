This past weekend I made it twice, once for a birthday gift and once because we were all sad to see it leave the house.  I used dark corn syrup and followed the recipe exactly.  To pop the popcorn, I put the kernels in a brown paper bag, folded the top over twice, and microwaved for 2-3 minutes.  No oil needed.  Repeat until you have 4 quarts.  The only tip I'd suggest that isn't in the recipe already is to also spray the spoon or spatula you use to stir the corn with cooking spray.  The pots and pans clean up easily after a soak in hot soapy water.  Then you can relax and attempt to avoid eating the entire batch of caramel corn all at once.",

I also sprayed my spatula so nothing would stick.  Drizzled it and stirred it.  Helped to have someone mixing the popcorn around as I was drizzling it.   Cooked it 45 min and stirred it every 10 min.   Laid it out on parchment paper and it was delicious.  Gone!  Very easy, just time consuming because of the stirring but so easy for anyone to make and look like a pro!  I am going to try adding peanuts and drizzle chocolate next time.",

This recipe used dark corn syrup so I tried it out, and it was great. I popped a generous 1/3 cup corn, and it was great. The liquid foams a bit in the oven, which really helps with coating the popcorn. Also, dark corn syrup doesn't have the high fructose syrup light corn syrup has.",

I'm so glad I did because this recipe is the best caramel corn recipe I have ever tried.  The only thing I did differently is lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees and bake for an hour stirring every 15 minutes.  I also use a 20\" diameter stainless steel mixing bowl to bake the caramel corn and a silicone spatula to stir.  It's a lot easier and I don't have to worry about caramel corn dropping out of the pans when I stir it.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I'd do it.",

This is a very good recipe for home-made caramel, and is a great alternative to melting 40 (or so) individually unwrapped caramels. The way I figure it, it'll take me about as long to make the caramel as it will to unwrap all of those candies, and the quality of home-made items is typically better than store bought. A few side notes (as usual): Instead of measuring out 4 qts., I just use 2 bags of popped buttered microwave popcorn, and it the portioning comes out perfect. I also do line my cookie sheets with foil, the caramel corn comes off easier when scraping it with a greased spatula. I don't find it necessary to bake it for as long... Typically I bake my batch for about 30 minutes, scraping each tray (to prevent burning) every 10 minutes. I allow it to cool on foil, and have never really had the need to spray it with cooking spray. Once its cool, it comes off fine. This recipe received 5 stars in my opinion because it was simple, tasty, and came out perfect every time.",
