Following the recipe as described the pancakes came out bland and didn't seem to have any flavor other than a tangy twist.  No cocoa flavor despite the addition of cocoa!  My suggestions: 1) Add one more tablespoon of cocoa powder and sugar to the listed recipe.  Don't skimp because it really takes the flavor up a notch which to my palate was perfect!! 2) Cook the pancakes on a lower heat setting then regularly.  I found these pancakes like to burn a little faster than others.  They do better at a lower heat. 3) Butter and spray oil for the pan/griddle is essential.  A little melted butter followed up by a spray of oil and you will have a hint of buttery flavor and a slight browning to the red batter. 4) Let your batter remain a little on the lumpy side. It does seem to produce better pancakes.  Let the bubbles form completely and the edges dry out a tad before flipping.  The cream cheese drizzle works a little better with a touch of milk and a few seconds in the microwave.  Enjoy!!",

They do brown fairly quickly so keep temp a bit lower than you usually do. Suggest if you want to cook in butter instead you also add some oil to avoid burn. If your pancakes taste stale you had an ingredient that is old probably flour oil or cocoa. The recipe itself wouldn't cause a stale taste. And spoon flour into your measuring cup. You can change the taste and texture a lot by changing the density of flour in a cup by scooping. We thought the drizzle was ok. Had some cream cheese frosting leftover from rolls that was better but my son preferred plain with fresh raspberries. Son has already asked for them again.",
