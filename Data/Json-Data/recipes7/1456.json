So in an effort to drink more water I've been trying a number of creative ways to flavor it - and this caught my eye. It is mild and delicate enough to drink with meals as you would water, but still has enough flavor and interest to drink in its own right as a refreshing beverage. I only steeped the tea bag for three minutes, not wanting the slightest bit of bitterness, and used Splenda rather than sugar. I found the orange to be a nice contrast to the lemon one would typically expect. The rose water was an interesting and pleasant addition and the one teaspoon was just the right amount. I was happy to find another use for the bottle of it I have in the cupboard! In addition to being delicious, refreshing and a great way to up my water intake, this is quite pretty too, especially served in a clear glass pitcher. No reason at all to limit this \"Springtime Citrus Cooler\" to springtime.  I plan to have this in the fridge regularly!",

And I bet you can make it with less water if you do want a stronger tea. I made it with blood oranges and squeezed a bit of the juice in which gave it a beautiful color.\n\nUpdate--I've made this countless times in the last month, and it's always a hit when I serve it. One thing to watch out for though, don't steep the tea excessively or it leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.",

I made it exactly as written even using the optional rose water (I found this recipe mainly because I had some I needed to use up). My big addition though is that this needs time to develop. Maybe there should even be a step 2 to let it sit for 12 hours or a day or even more. I had my first glass almost immediately after making a batch and thought it weak with a prominent rose flavor. Plus the fact that it wasn't chilled didn't help much. That pitcherful lasted for 4 days I think and the last couple of glasses tasted great with much more orange flavor. (I'm not enough of a tea connoisseur to care much about the Earl Grey flavors.) A bonus is that after the liquid is all gone the orange slices make nice dessert-time snacks. I have another batch of this in the fridge as I write....",

The only thing I did differently was to substitute artificial sweetener for the sugar. It's light but not too watery. It doesn't taste like Earl Grey yet it doesn't taste like orange either. You'll just have to try it! The rose water is so fragrant and really adds to it. Thank you for this great recipe!",
