To do this easily and remove alot of it's juice, just put the shredded zucchini into a potato ricer and squeeze. (You'll be amazed how much a potato ricer can squeeze out!) Also, if you want a nice  dome top for this muffin or any quick breads, heat oven to a HOT 450' oven, put muffins in and immediately reduce Temp to what the recipe states, in this case 400'  for 18min.  I think these muffins are really good.  I left out the nuts as I don't like crunch in my muffins!  THX ",

Oh and I almost forgot - I didn't have oat flour so I substituted oat bran. They rose like no muffin I've baked before have a wonderful taste and texture. I will be using this recipe quite a bit although I think I may try to go a step further and omit the oil altogether substituting applesauce.

I also did not add the cup of sugar and only went with the 3/4 cup honey (I'd rather have honey than white sugar). Lastly I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream.

                "reviewBody": "I'm ashamed to say this recipe didn't work out for me. And even more ashamed to say because of its popularity and great reviews I doubled the batch expecting to freeze and eat these for breakfast for weeks to come. I followed the recipe pretty closely but took the advice that worked for others. I squeezed excess moisture from zuchinni. I decreased the sugar and subbed honey. I also used dried cherries and walnuts instead. It seemed like everyone took their own variations and were pleased. Mine were bland and boring for everything that went into them. My mother's buttermilk bran and raisin muffins are much better and quicker to make. These seemed like a far cry from those. They were barely sweet and the texture was too dense. I realize I decreased the sugar too much but I was very careful to not over-work the batter which usually produces toughness. I used the suggestion of another and raised the oven temp for preheating and then lowered to the recipe's temp upon placing the muffins inside. This did produce a tall muffin but the bottoms began to blacken on me. On the second round I lowered the oven temp to 375 and this still occured. I know it sounds like this could be the tell-tale sign of an amateur baker but I assure you I'm not. This just wasn't for me. But I appreciate and applaud all those that were able to get great results. Don't let my review sway you against trying this out. Everyone's opinions and experiences are different. This was just mine.",
