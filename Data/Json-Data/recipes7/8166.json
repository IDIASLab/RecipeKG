I eliminated the sugar used fresh parsley and fresh tomatoes (opening a can for 2 servings wouldn't have been practical) and gave them several good turns of fresh ground pepper. As this recipe's first reviewer I'm happy to give this recipe two thumb's up - for eye appeal as well as for being a little beyond the ordinary.",

You can cut back on the oil a little too with no problem. For the initial cook time with the garlic I only did 10 min because I didn't want to overcook the garlic. To compensate I added on a few min at the end and the beans came out perfectly crisp. This would be a repeat recipe! Thank you!",
