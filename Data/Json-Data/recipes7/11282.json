And I use half of romaine lettuce \"heart,\" not the whole romaine lettuce itself.  You can definitely use any lettuce you like, but still, I think 1/2 head of it will be too much for one serving, especially to make a rice bowl.  I also noticed that you can't see the footnotes when you use your mobile app.  I don't recommend to substitute the Korean chili powder with any other chili powders.  It will be too spicy and alter the taste drastically.  But if you must, make sure to add small amount at a time and taste it. Hope you enjoy!",

Most can be found at large grocery store chains or you can buy online.  I have made this several times and have substituted brown sugar or honey for the white sugar with each substitute giving it a bit different flavor. I also used spinach and spring mix salad combo once with friends and they all loved it. If you want a crispy fried tofu, you can use firm/extra firm tofu drained very well and pat it very dry and fry in a nonstick pan till brown and crisp--about 3-5 minutes a side. You can't go wrong with it as written either so enjoy!",
