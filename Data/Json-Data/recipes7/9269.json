I did not get 18 muffins out of this recipe, I actually got 12 that were a bit on the smaller side. Baked at 350*, mine were done at exactly 20 minutes. Ohmygoodness, are these GORGEOUS! They look like something you'd see on the cover of a cooking magazine. And they were absolutely delicious! This was perfect for me as someone who is cooking with on hand ingredients but wanted to bake something. Excellent muffin recipe!",

I put all the dry ingredients in and then mixed them with the whip to be sure the baking soda was well dispersed. Next I put in the softened butter. In the morning I added the two eggs pumpkin and water while mixing with the batter attachment not the whip. I made 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins for the grand kids. One major difference that will definitely improve taste and how well they keep I used pastry flour. We would never have used a standard patent flour in muffins. Standard patent is simply wrong and dries the product out. The old bakers would have knocked me in the head if I had made that mistake. I miss those guys. Anyway this will result in moister muffins.",
