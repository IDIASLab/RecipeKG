                "reviewBody": "The ONLY reason why I give this recipe 3 stars saying it was OK is because my first batch of butter and sugar that I melted together (per the instructions) was a total FAIL. I am a very comfortable cook in the kitchen. When I say FAIL I mean the butter and sugar together never melded. It was like sand from a beach. So I thought I'd put vanilla extract in it off the stove and put it back on the element to stir and see if it'd help matters. It didn't. Instead it made the sugar into one big brown caramelized lump and the butter clarified all around it. It was the weirdest thing I've ever experienced. I started over. This time I melted the butter first. Then added and stirred the sugar for a minute while it was boiling. Still the color never caramelized and it wound up being more like cotton candy in texture. I poured it over the saltines and it was like spreading cheap icing on a sugar cookie. I baked it. Then skeptically added the chocolate chips (Callebaut) thinking that it wouldn't possibly melt but it did. I toasted pecans and put that on top. Once the pan cooled a bit I stuck it in the fridge. I've given this treat away and EVERYONE loves it. They think it's their new addiction. I'm happy since this was not how I first tasted this treat (made by a friend) and I felt defeated since my sugar/butter combo never materialized into ribbons of caramel. C'est la vie but I will do it again! I will master it!",
