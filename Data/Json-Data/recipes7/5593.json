I pretty much followed stefy's directions to the letter except for subbing meatloaf mix (i.e. ground beef, veal & pork) for plain 'ol beef. My grocer usually doesn't stock this, but tonight I was in luck. :) I am really glad I was able to make an authentic bolognese and think it was worth the extra cost to do so. Served with garlic & butter dinner rolls and Caesar salad, this was a very hearty meal. Thanks for sharing your grandfather's recipe, stefychefy! :-)",
