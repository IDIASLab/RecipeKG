The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce and we could barely taste the chipotle. I added more chipotles and quite a bit of salt but still felt like there should have been another layer of flavor. Since I've never had torta before I didn't know if it needed a little adjusting or if it's really supposed to be a simple tomato based recipe. We ate a couple of the sandwiches like the recipe suggested but ended up mixing the sauce with the pork and eating as pulled pork sandwiches.",
