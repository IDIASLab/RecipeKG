Shoot - It doesn't have to be warm weather to enjoy this. Great flavor. It was difficult to blend even in the Vitamix using crushed ice to start with. I added a bit more carob than called for (think I doubled it) because the 1 tsp called for didn't give it enough flavor for me. I am not a vegan so I subbed honey and I also had cashew milk on hand. I don't buy soy. Easily adaptable. Great treat!",

I'm not sure if mine just mixed too powerfully or if I should have frozen it for a bit first. The only thing I'd change is to use creamy peanut butter next time and add peanuts if I want crunch. The blended peanuts weren't the best texture for me but it was still good enough that I ate it all.:)",
