The oat flour doesn't have its usual nutty flavor in this bread like I expected it to, but it's a good carrier for butter, jelly, deli meat, etc.  My bread machine doesn't have a \"normal\" time setting because it's based on the size and color of loaf (even on the White Bread setting).  I chose 1.5 pounds and light crust.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks also for the tip about substituting oat flour in yeast breads!",
