                "reviewBody": "Hi this is my recipe and I just wanted to make these notes that Allrecipe changed: - use 1 whole star anise. Remove the star anise before using the filling. - start with 1/8 cup soy sauce as some brands can be too salty. I use Kikkoman. Taste the filling before using it and adjust salt level to your taste. Step 1 Heat 1 cup cold milk for 1 minute. The cold eggs oil and water will bring the liquid temperature down to lukewarm when they re all mixed together. Step 6 - Preheat oven to 100F - this is purely for the last rise. 200F will kill your dough. If you don t have parchment paper you can grease the baking sheet with vegetable oil. Step 8 Turn off the oven once it reaches 100F. The oven should feel like a warm summer day. Step 10 I use my oven s convection setting for more even browning.",
