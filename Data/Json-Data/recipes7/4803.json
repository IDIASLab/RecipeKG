I eliminate the salt, sub honey for sugar, use fresh oregano, omit the msg, use 1 tablespoon minced garlic, sub balsamic vinegar, reduce the pepper to 1/8 tsp and add about 1/4 c. soy sauce (hence the omitted salt, tho I add fresh-ground sea salt at the table), about 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, and a Tbs or so of chopped scallion if I have any on hand. I haven't marinated as long as 3 days; 24 hours seems plenty. I've also thrown in large pieces of bell pepper and chunks of zucchini, all of which have been a big hit among family & guests (including a lot of my daughter's teenaged friends).",

I don't use MSG as probably it is used in the recipe as a food preserver and my family makes sure that they don't last long in the fridge. I use balsamic but red wine vinegar is good also. The use of red onions instead of yellow or white onions gives it a mellower flavor. I also add a squeeze of lemon or lime (whatever you have in hand) as it gives it a very fresh flavor. Other variations use Crimini (Baby Bella) instead of Button Mushrooms and also try the marinade brushed over grilled Portabella; simply wonderful. Double up on this one inexpensive to make and extremely tasty.",

However I've continued to make it several times for myself. I like it best the next day and that's generally how I eat it. I have been telling my buddies about these mushrooms and I told them that I think that they'd be great deep fat fried. I followed the recipe exactly again except this time instead of leaving my onions in slices (because I like to eat them too) I put everything (except the mushrooms) in a blender to get as much flavor into the marinade as possible. Then last night we breaded them in a store bought onion ring batter and deep fat fried them. They were incredible. That took this recipe and brought it to another level. You gained about another 6 fans last night. I shared with them all this recipe. I'm sure that it will be popular at all the camp sites this summer. Thanks again for a fantastic recipe.",
