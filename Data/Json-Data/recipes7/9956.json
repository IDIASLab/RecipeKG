It took over 4 really long bananas to use up most of the batter. I also think I didn't cut these at 1/2 inch either. They were more like an inch thick. And to me that was perfect size. And I used my deep fryer which was simpler. Otherwise these were so tasty and the bananas were extremely soft from the frying that I was popping them left and right into my mouth. I'm not one for baked or fried bananas unless it's in bread but these were amazing. I didn't play nice and had a hard time sharing;-) TY will make again.",
