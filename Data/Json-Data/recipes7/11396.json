I changed the dumpling recipe slightly since I had never seen a fluffy dumpling recipe with cut in shortening and I was afraid the texture would be more like biscuits than dumplings. I used my mother's recipe which is similar except it calls for breaking two eggs into a measuring cup and filling with milk to make one cup instead of cutting in butter. I will try again with apples and maybe blueberries. Wonderful flavor.",
