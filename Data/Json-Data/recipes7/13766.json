I microwaved much longer than the recipe called for and it did finally thinken, but it was not smooth. I think that if you have to edit the recipe to make it work, it's not a 5 star recipe. Obviously stove top would have been better; it always is. And I would suggest following the cornstarch directions on other reviews. That probably would have made a positive difference. It worked out. It tasted good. I'm not sure I strongly recommend the recipe though, definitely not as written. Photo is of Extreme Chocolate Cake  with this as the custard filling, and Kit Kats, per the birthday boy's request.",
