I also baked these for 10 minutes longer than directed so the topping would slightly brown.",

Overall i thought this was good, it just wasn't what I was looking for based on the name.  I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin mix, and added the nuts in with the topping.  The topping needs less flour: 1/3 c flour, 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c brown sugar worked great.  I used an 8x8 pan because i didn't think i could get the crust spread out in the bigger pan.  I ended up cooked for 10 min longer because of the thickness.  If you're looking for a pumpkin pie bar, this woud work.  I'll keep searching for a better use for pumpkin.",
