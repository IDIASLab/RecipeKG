I used shredded coleslaw mix instead of cabbage.\" For a time-saver I used a bag of coleslaw mix but did everything else as written although didn't leave mine quite as long as 45 min. in dutch oven only b/c I didn't want the cabbage to turn to moosh. Maybe it was the vinegar and carraway seeds (two things that I haven't used in all of the other cabbage/sausage recipes that I've had from AR) but something about this one didn't appeal to us quite enough to want to make again. Daughter only wanted the buttered egg noodles and the kielbasa and husband didn't lunge at the leftovers the following day so while we're cabbagaholics in almost all its forms it's unlikely we'll make this recipe again.",
