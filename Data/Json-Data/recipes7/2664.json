To fix the buttermilk dilemma some reviews have mentioned, try this: to make substitute buttermilk, add 1-3/4 tablespoons of cream of tartar to a cup of milk, or add a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup of milk and let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes. In many baking recipes, you can also just use plain yogurt or sour cream instead of buttermilk. I use the vinegar method but the rest are good to know. I never buy buttermilk anymore because I never use the whole carton. Buttermilk is one of those where I could have it for weeks then not need it, as soon as it goes bad I need it. This is handy to keep in your box for any recipe calling for buttermilk, when in a pinch use a substitute.",

                "reviewBody": "This is the best recipe I've found for chicken fried steak!  I allow my steaks to \"rest\" on a wire rack after the final coating of flour - which seems to help the coating adhere - also make sure to pat your steaks dry with paper towels then season them as you'd like before beginning the breading process -  this will also help the coating adhere better.  It is also important that the oil reach the proper temperature before adding the steaks - I used Mazola Canola oil instead of shortening and did not need near the amount called for - used maybe 3/4 - 1c total.  After the steaks are cooked and keeping warm (to prevent sogginess keep them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet) in a 200 oven; I do add some finely chopped onion and garlic to the oil and drippings in the pan and saute before adding the flour and milk - make sure the flour is cooked in the oil to avoid a pasty, flour-y taste to your gravy.  I also like to add about 1/4c chicken stock after adding the milk - I found I only needed about 2 1/2 to 3c of milk.  These additions seem to give the gravy the boost my family likes.  An EXCELLENT recipe that my family loves, thanks so much for sharing!",

Because I'm in the Denver area, frying can be a problem - things get overdone on the outside while undercooked inside. So as soon as the outsides were done, I put them in the oven like shake-and-bake for about 1/2 hour. Also, IMHO, a touch of garlic immensely improves country gravy, so I added garlic powder to the gravy. I also couldn't find uncultured buttermilk, but regular milk worked fine. ",
