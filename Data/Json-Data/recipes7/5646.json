Even better - it wasn't really a lot of work.  I used the leftovers to make an apple crisp and it is GOOD!!  I would say this recipe is the standard 'sweetness' of a bakery applie pie, but we don't like things too sweet so on the second batch I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, using Granny Smith apples which are a bit tart.  The apples positively shine!  I'm definitely going to be using this recipe this fall when the apple crop comes in!  Note:  if you want to make this in quarts, double the recipe for 7 quarts and process for 25 minutes.  It takes about 2 quarts to make one 9\" pie.",

You must use ClearJel which is kind of hard to find at markets (at the present time). Using cornstarch can interfere with the bacteria heat killing process and is not recommended by the USDA.  If you're unable to find ClearJel, you can still can your filling, and then simply add flour or cornstarch after you open the jar (simmer with flour for 5 minutes or mix flour & melted butter together and add it to your filling before baking).",

To cut to the end of it. . . it was really easy. We used apples that our children had picked, which we have in abundance of, that are mostly Macintosh and Cortland.  We tested them in pastries and the were delish, and our girls all approved. The one thing that I would change is the amount of sugar to 2 cups, like one of the reviewers had mentioned; we don't eat a lot of sugary things. \n\nLooking forward to making a lot more.",
