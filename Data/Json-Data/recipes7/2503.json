Rather than shredding the apples I chopped them up between coarse and fine in my food processor; much quicker than shredding! I used flaxseed rather than olive oil and pineapple rather than orange juice as that was all I had. I used wholemeal spelt flour instead of white. As I didn't have xanthan gum I subbed half a cup of strong regular wholewheat flour to give it some gluten to help it stick together. A couple of comments. My cake needed nowhere near an hour to bake. I checked it about half an hour in and it was done! I don't know if using wholewheat flour prevented it from rising much or if that is just the nature of the cake. It wasn't too heavy just dense. I might try it with 3 eggs next time (mine were only medium size anyways). It is very flavoursome and moist so it's definitely a keeper.",

Once it cooled slightly it came out of the pan with no problems and I had to dig into it right way as the smell of it is amazing. What I did was cut it up ready to serve and then I mixed some icing sugar and milk together to create a very watered down icing to pour overtop to finish it off. So very yummy.",

Just for others out there: I had no xantham gum and only 1/4 cup vegetable oil. So I subbed half applesauce half oil and I also didn't have raw apples on hand. Only the dehydrated that you buy through the LDS cannery. I used the food processor on them and added an extra egg (size medium) also used apple juice instead of orange...This turned out like a moist sponge cake. It was flat due to not having a bundt cake pan but I thought it was a nice treat:) First time baking with spelt. Thanks for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "I was very excited to find this healthy recipe for apple cake with spelt exactly what I was looking for for my very first adventure into baking with spelt-instead-of-wheat! It turned out pretty good but a little too wet for my taste. The recipe calls for 5 apples and I used medium sized apples. When I turned out the cake it felt still too wet although the batter was cooked which I think is an indication of too much apple in the recipe. I'd recommend only 4 apples to get a cake that's a little more cake-with-apple and a little less like baked apples with a little cake around them. A few changes: I never find it necessary to peel apples -- I just processed UNpeeled apple chunks instead of labor-intensive peeling and grating; I added more than a cup of chopped pecans (could also have used walnuts) because I love apple and nut together; I used 1/2 C brown sugar instead of the white sugar; and did half fresh lemon juice and half OJ instead of all OJ. At half an hour the cake had risen beautifully and looked done on top but definitely wasn't ready inside (checked with toothpick). However 45 min. seemed more than enough: done inside with the top looking very brown. Next time I'll try doing the first 20 min. at 400F (200C) and then reduce heat to 350F (180C) until it's done.",
