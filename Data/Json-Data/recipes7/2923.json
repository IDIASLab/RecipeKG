I think sometimes we Americans feel shortchanged if we don't get all the bells and whistles, or if every lily isn't gilded; gastronomically speaking.  On my perfect Christmas cookie platter, there are the 'fancy', rich, or showy ones, and then the 'plainer', simple, or unadorned ones.  There is a place for both, I think, and I thought these were wonderful.  It reminded me of a part of what best about German cooking.  Thank you Oma Kiener, and Oma Keiner's children!",

First the dough was too dry so I added 2 TB of milk. Secondly I could not find ground hazelnuts so I tried to ground whole ones in my blender but ended up with powdered hazelnuts. If I'd had larger pieces I think these would have been better. Lastly I frosted the cookies with Nutella which seemed to help a lot.",
