This is the exact same recipe, and I can tell you after baking this pie for 20+ years that it is without a doubt the best pecan pie there is.  If you want a fancy presentation, take your pecans and arrange them in the pie crust.  Press them down slightly.  Then add your liquid.  The nuts will rise to the top during baking leaving a professional appearance.  I have only done this a few times when I really wanted a WOW presentation.",

I was worried that it might have to strong of an alcohol flavor, but it cooked right out and left it with a more sophisticated taste that was a welcome change from the same ole' pecan pie.  Everyone loved it so I will be making again soon! Thanks for sharing Kimberly",

First of all the recipe calls for a 9\" deep dish pie crust. The filling however only filled up about 1/2 inch of the pie dish. While cooking it \"rose\" up to about halfway up the crust but once it came out and cooled it deflated down to maybe just 1/4 inch of filling. And what little there was tasted awful very eggy and not yummy at all. The only change I made to the recipe was that I used brandy instead of bourbon (all I had on hand). What I am wondering is that I used egg beaters instead of whole eggs. Would that have made such a huge difference? I am hesitant to even attempt this again.",
