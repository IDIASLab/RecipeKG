According to the cookie mix you need to add 2 Tbsp water so I added that to the dough. The size of 9\"x13\" is quite big. You won't have enough dough after reserving dough to make 3 cookies. Possibly 8\"x8\" would be better. I didn't quite understand the point of baking the cream cheese mixture with the cookie base...in fact you don't know it's there after the whipped topping is added. Overall not bad but this recipe won't work as listed.",
