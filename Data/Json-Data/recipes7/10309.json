The bread is very moist from the fruits and its texture is a little on the dense side. I had no canned crushed pineapple so I just used some fresh pineapple from the fridge chopped it very finely and I did add some chopped pecans. Made half a recipe and got two small loaves. Although a little sweet for us (personal taste) it is very tasty.",

Like Lultzflcat I didn't have the pineapple on hand and had to improvise which might have lead to the heaviness of the bread issue. I also added chopped pecans which I thought rather saved the recipe for me (added flavor). It tasted fine but like my husband said when he ate a piece...\"it needs more bread texture\". The picture is what motivated me to want to try this recipe. It's one of those recipes where I wasn't too disappointed but wasn't 100% pleased either. Would like to try it again sometime though.",
