It is pretty spicy so if that's a concern I would suggest cutting the crushed red pepper a tiny bit but I really suggest putting it in there -- it makes a world of difference! I think the next time I will do a quick run through with an emulsion blender to break up a couple of the chunks of tomato but again not too much because it really gives it a robust feel.

I used canned diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato puree because i like some tomato chunks instead of completely smooth. I also added some garlic and some chicken stock to taste. I used baguettes instead of rye with the Brie and I also made some with parmesan. I floated the crostini on top of the soup instead of pouring soup over it because I like a little crunch left in the bread as you eat it. Once I had everything assembled I blended part of the soup to smooth it out and I found the second time I made it that if you blend the cream cheese you won't end up with little bits of cream cheese floating in the soup. If you love tomato soup you will love this. I made it three days in a row!",
