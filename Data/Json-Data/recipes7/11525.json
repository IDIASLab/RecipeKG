Jelly and jams can be water bath canned without preservatives  like vinegar and salt.  When vinegar is used it MUST BE 5% vinegar,  nothing less!  Vinegar less than 5% can cause spoilage and food poisoning.   \n\nThis recipe IS NOT certified by the  national canning institute. Therefore, proper pH is not established.  Ive made it and its good.  However,  long term storage can be risky.  \n\nIf you're not familiar with the proper procedures for canning,  take the time to learn. With proper safety and knowledge,  it's an awesome way to preserve food.",

You taste the sweetness of the raspberries first, then followed by the heat of the habaneros - and it IS a nice consistent burn. Not overwhelming, but definitely present. I used fresh raspberries and measured them out with a kitchen scale rather than using cups. The only change I made was to use a red pepper rather than a green one so that the colors were consistent and blended. Five habaneros (and their seeds) produced the perfect amount of heat. A new favorite!",
