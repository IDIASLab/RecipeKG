It takes about 10-15 minutes of beating (easier in a stand mixer). My personal preference is to use this frosting on a cake that is kept in the fridge. Jello cake is excellent much better then the standard cool whip. Also I learned the first time I ever made this not to taste it til it was completely done, IT WILL TASTE AWFUL before its mixed til fluffy, it sets up to a firm frosting on a fridge cake. I also stick it in the fridge for a few minutes before I frost my cake.",

The flavor of the frosting was pretty decent a little lacking in complexity (all my mouth was thinking was 'Sugar and butter') Aslo i would strongly recommend adding the hot milk very little by little. I accidentally put too much in at once and it melted all of my butter and shortning and i was left with a runny liquid. I tried to put it in an ice bath but it never thickened up the way i was hoping it would. Ended up using it still drippy Will probably try this recipe again when i have the need- I like how simple it is to make. Good recipe to know incase you ever have a frosting emergency.",

I did listen to the advice to let it blend for 15 minutes first but it still tastes aweful and I'm pretty sure that I did everything correctly - it would be hard not to. I just abhor the taste of shortening and this tastes like crisco mixed with sugar. Sorry but no thanks. I looked at some other recipes in an effort to fix this. I added one egg white and another 1/2 cup butter. It tastes a lot better and the butter seems to have gotten rid of the shortening taste. it will do.",
