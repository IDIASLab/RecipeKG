I too left out the donuts -- instead I toasted some raw almonds in a frying pan and gave it a nice chunky chop. I also used Nescafe-brand instant coffee (the \"classic\" variety found in Spanish stores). I've had my share of instant coffees and this has got a wonderful unique richness. I was too impatient to chill the mixture (KitchenAid asks you to refrigerate all mixes at least 6 hours before churning it in the ice cream attachment) so it took quite a long time to become \"ice cream-y\". Though I was nervous at first within 20 minutes I knew I was in love. The ice cream is chilling in the freezer now and I will update this review if it is anything less than mindblowingly spectacular. But if I don't update it's because I'm too busy eating the whole dang container.",
