My family of 7 loved it; there was plenty plus leftovers.  I used what I had on hand so I had several substitutes: I added some zucchini (1c.) and green beans (3/4c) and left out the celery; increased macaroni to 1 cup.  Also I did not have Italian tomatoes so I used 6 medium tomatoes + 2 tsp. Italian seasoning +1/4 tsp. cumin.  I used 6c. water + 3 tsp. beef bullion granules + 8 oz. tomato sauce in place of beef broth.  I think would turn out great no matter what veggies you throw in!",
