They are more like a sweet hush puppy than the corn fritters I made growing up. I like the light and airy fritters so I gave this a 4-star. My husband and son loved them and couldn't stop eating them. I've never had a clam fritter. I think I'd be more inclined to jalapeno and cheddar maybe crab...",

I liked this Way better then 4 stars but I cheated and used that 'little blue box' of cornbread mix. There was a corn on the cob in the fridge that tasted like candy corn that got added. The clams were a bargain bin find to which I used the juice and made a cocktail sauce with. Very good! These fritters basically had everything one would want sweet salty & crispy fried yumminess. Thank you Lisa01 next time I find those discount clams I'll know exactly what to do with them!",
