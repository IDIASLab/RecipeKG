I like the fact that it can be made in the microwave (not heating up the kitchen) and we did like it although it was a little dry. That well could be just a matter of adjusting the time as I know microwave temperatures can vary. Next time I will check the kugel at 5 minutes during the final cook cycle rather than setting it for 7 minutes.",
