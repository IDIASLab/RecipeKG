I used one small white onion in place of the red onion because that's all I had and I used two banana peppers from the garden instead of one. My husband and I loved it. I may try brown sugar in place of the white sugar only because I personally would have liked a little more sweetness but my husband said it was perfect just the way it was. Will definitely keep this one. Thanks!",
