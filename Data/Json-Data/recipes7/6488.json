A few changes like most cooks - omitted the sugar, added 3 stalks of celery, cut in 2 inch segments and didn't coat the meat with flour. Because I had almost double the meat, I browned the beef in divided batches, then added everything else. My 6 qt pot was pretty full so had to remove some liquid to leave the required 1/3 space at the top. ( Very important!)  Also thickened mine with cornstarch. All minor changes. Very nice beef stew recipe that went from conception to table in 1 hour!  Love it!",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks Kelly!... With our changes to meet our tastes this is the best beef stew I've ever enjoyed to date! and we are in our fifties We made this particular recipe tonight for supper with the following changes: - substituted beef broth for water and bouillon = more hearty flavor profile and less salt - added 1 3/4 cups of Cotes-Du-Rhone red wine into pot (moderately dry great body excellent with beef) it makes the broth robust and hearty in its flavor!... - cooked onions in pot with broth wine 3/4\" pieces of celery garlic and herbs - after setting aside the browned beef added mushrooms to skillet with butter to saute' / deglaze = a better \"earthy\" flavor component and great with red wine! Of course the wine alcohol cooks out with the wine adding to the hearty flavor profile and leaving just a small wine flavor that only is identified as a final flavor note in each spoonful. This recipe is now the base recipe for our future beef stews. Future versions will include: - adding corn and green beans(consider deleting celery to control liquids)etc.; for variation at times. (also are excellent versions of a beef stew)",
