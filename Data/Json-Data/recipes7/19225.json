A good tip; is to put the pineapple into the food processor prior to cooking it for smaller pieces. I chopped mine and the large pieces in the marmalade with the combination of orange apple & pineapple left an unpleasant texture. Could be the type of apple used or that being it is winter my pineapple was just not meant to be used for canning? Maybe after sitting it will get better however as of now I will not be making this again. Will update my review accordingly thank you for the recipe.",
