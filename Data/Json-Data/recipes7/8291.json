                "reviewBody": "Not too bad. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was really too sweet for my taste almost like candy. Perhaps it should be called \"Candied Carrots\" instead? I did use fresh squeezed orange juice so the only added sugar was natural. If I did make it again I would cut the sugar back a bit. Additionally I found that the carrots really need to cook a bit longer on the stove top as they only soften a touch in the oven for stated 20 minute bake. In fact I cooked them an additional 10 minutes in the oven 30 minutes total covered with foil to create a steam like bath and they were barely softer as when I removed them from the stove top. Overall a nice \"starter\" recipe and with a little tweaking you can make it your own - unless you like super sweet extra firm glazed carrots then this is definitely your recipe. Thanks Katie H.",
