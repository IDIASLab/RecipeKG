I don't mix the chocolate chips, instead I put five or six of them on top of the dough balls. And the most important thing of all: to bake soft cookies you need to use insulated pan sheet, so the cookies don't burn on the bottom. I don't have insulated pan sheet, so I use 2 regular pans, one on top of each other, then I put a parchment paper. I ake them for 10 minutes only, and then I slide the parchment paper into a cooling rack.",

Seeing that in general the dough falls and leaves a crunch cookie I added about 1/3 cup of peanut butter (I used crunchy). I also put peanuts in mine instead of chocolate chips. I found it also helped to bake at 340 for the ten mins instead of 350 and please make sure your oven rack is in the very top position so that the source of heat isn't right on the bottoms. I did use the confectioners' sugar. Someone mentioned it wasn't in the directions but it is. The directions say to sprinkle it on when the cookies were warm. I found it added just the right little extra touch of sweetness. Mine turned out soft and very yummy.",
