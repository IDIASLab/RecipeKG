My third try I used grape seed oil, cooked at 350 for 10 minutes, and seasoned them after they cooked. This time they turned out perfect, delicious, and as beautiful as the ones in the pictures.

I was making some pork chops with Chinese five spice and was looking for something to go with it. I had a couple of huge butternut squashes in my fridge and this was a perfect way to use them up. I will say, butternut squash is REALLY hard to cut up. I have to use my cleaver and meat mallet and it took me a long time to cut these into fries. My first batch was thin, my second batch was a thicker cut. We definitely liked the thicker cut better. The spice is the key!",
