So my grandson gets the best of the best!  The whole family liked it and each of us had two pieces!  It was very moist and so delicious.  I think the pineapple made the cake better.  I was a little afraid to take it out of the Bundt pan but I used a plastic knife around the edges and also set the pan  on a towel in a couple inches of boiling water before taking it out of the pan.  I had read this on a different site and  it came out of the pan almost perfect.  There was one small area that stuck on the side. But once I frosted  it, it wasn't noticeable . Besides it tasted so good. I will make this again.",
