I personally would have cooked the turkey at 325 for the entire time but that is just me. Also keep in mind that total cook time will depend on the size of your bird. Okay so back to the brine. I was skeptical but the turkey turned out super moist and tender. This worked just as well as the liquid brines I have used in the past.",
