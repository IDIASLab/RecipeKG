I used olive oil instead of avocado oil, 1 packet of Truvia instead of sugar, I used green onions with the bigger bulbs and added sliced mushrooms, roughly chopped baby bok choy and the broccoli.  It was so delicious that my husband wanted it again tonight! Tonight, I made a double batch because my 10 year old son was home. He loved it and asked me to get him a Thermos so that he can take it to school for lunch lol. This will be a regular in our house. (Side note: I think A Taste of Thai coconut milk is my new favorite! It has so much more coconut flavor than my usual brand)",
