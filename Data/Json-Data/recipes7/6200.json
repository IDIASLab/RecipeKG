The pineapple is a nice addition to spice cake and I adore brown sugar and butter. Calculated this recipe to four servings and made four separate cakes in buttered ramekins. Baked in a water bath for even cooking. Let cool. They turned out of the ramekins nicely after running a paring knife around the edges. As a change up from traditional Pineapple Upside Down Cake this is a nice treat.",

When it finally stopped I let it cook the rest of the way. It wouldn't unmold from the pan but it tasted great. Go figure.
