I also used 1 lb of ricotta because I wanted to use it up and only 3 links of hot Italian sausage which I browned then gave a quick whirl in my food processor with the spinach and ricotta.  I keep a small container of extra virgin olive oil with a garlic clove in it for flavor that I use to brush pizza dough and calzones with before they go into the oven.  I also put slashes on top of calzones to allow the moisture in riccota to vent other wise they may explode which I've had happen.  I bake them on my pizza stone and serve with a home made pizza sauce from another site.  This was a huge hit.",

In no way possible did the recipe for the crust make enough for four calzones. I got two but with one cup of flour (the other 1/2 cup in recipe is for kneading) I should have known. Because of this I had wayyy to much fillings. I had to throw out almost half of the sausage mix and more than half of the cheeses mix. What a waste! I also had to scramble to figure out what to do since we are a family of four and I have only two calzones! I had to order a pizza and after all that work I feel a bit frazzled....Sorry but this recipe just doesn't work as is. I have the two in the oven now for another day....hope they reheat well!",

Since our children were more interested in pizza I had enough dough left over for two large calzones. It was great. My husband has a nitrate allergy found in most sausage so we used Al Fresco brand Sweet Italian Style Chicken Sausage (with red and green peppers in it). It comes in links pre-cooked so I diced up two links and warmed them up on the stove. Made the spinach and cheese mixture as directed except I eliminated all the Italian type seasonings since the sausage already was very flavorful. I added the toppings as directed but sprinkled a tiny amount of mozzarella on top before folding over. Using a fork to pinch the edges works great and looks professional. I baked them on our pre-heated pizza stone for about 18 min and they were perfect. Put pizza sauce on the side. Delicious.",
