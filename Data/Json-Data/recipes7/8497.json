I did three things differently from the instructions: I used only half a chicken (used the other half for a different recipe) even though I followed the instructions for brining and cutting----I put foil in a 13x9 pan and used a small grate rather than a broiler pan---and I put a sheet of foil over the top (just laid it on) of the chicken after about 15 minutes so it didn't burn. We don't eat the skin so that is used only for moisture and flavor. The timing on this was just about right on--within several minutes. I don't even want to know how many calories the potatoes have in them because we plan on eating all of them tonight. They are so yummy. Thank you for this technique Cara!",

I am not crazy about Dijon mustard but I decided to follow the recipe exactly so that I could rate it fairly as written and WOW this was good! I didn't check the weight of my chicken so that is my fault but it took quite a bit longer than the 40 minutes indicated in the recipe. I think the description is a bit misleading. Between brining and preparing the chicken the butter mixture and the potatoes I couldn't make this on a workday even if it did finish baking in 40 minutes. I put green beans in with the potatoes and roasted them and both were delicious! Thank you carabakescupcakes. I will certainly make this again and again. By the time the chicken was finally finished my little girls and I couldn't wait while I took a picture but we all enjoyed it. I will have to add a picture next time I make it.",

I made this spur of the moment so I didn't have time to brine my bird. This was so good even without doing that so I can't wait to do the brine next time I make this. I cook whole chickens at least twice a month but this was the first time I spatchcooked one like this. Since my bird was bigger than what was called for I doubled the ingredients. I used my NuWave infrared oven instead of the conventional oven. I put the potatoes on the 1\" rack and the chicken on the 2\" rack. Everything came out so juicy and flavorful. We didn't have any leftovers! This is my daughter's new favorite meal. Thanks for the recipe carabakescupcakes!",
