You can always add more sugar until it s to your desired sweetness. I also add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and usually cut out the nutmeg but it s good added too. I find I have a lot of leftover glaze so I cut all those ingredients in half as well. I like the taste of the tart better the next day but the glaze can make the crust mushy if you use too much. The recipe fills up two 8 springform pans with no crust leftover. Looks beautiful when it s removed from the pan.",
