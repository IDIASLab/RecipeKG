This made for easy clean-up and also was an easy way to transfer the seeds to the pan. I read some of the reviews and decided to heat the oil and melt the sugar ahead of time BEFORE adding the seeds. (I used 1 T. oil 1 T. margarine and a drop of water with the 2T. sugar.) I set this aside as I waited for the seeds to finish toasting which took 35 minutes at 275 degrees. I added the toasted seeds to the melted sugar mixture and tossed them together over medium heat. Then I added the spice/sugar mixture removed the pan from the heat and mixed all until well coated. (I did not feel that there was a need for a separate bowl; I did all the mixing in one pan.) I added a bit more cinnamon and used only 4T. sugar overall instead of the 6T. it calls for. This is definitely better than the traditional salt-only roasted seeds!",
