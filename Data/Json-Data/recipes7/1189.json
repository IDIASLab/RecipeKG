Decreased the cinnamon to 1 tsp as previous reviewers recommended.  I didn't decrease the amount of water.  Granted, the syrup doesn't thicken up which is what previous reviewers were commenting on, but oh my goodness, the liquid tastes so good I didn't care!  It soaked right into the pancakes and the flavour was incredible! Thank you very much for such a great recipe :)",
