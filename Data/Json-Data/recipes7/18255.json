Some varieties have white flesh with black seeds. It's not very sweet, but has a nice texture. Dragon fruit, also called pitaya, is a cactus species. I used the juice to make a puree to swirl into the cake batter. Then I used more of it to make icing for the cake.",

There are also a lot of rare ingredients in this cake that you'll buy specifically for this and then may not be able to use up for anything else before they expire on you. Best tasting cake recipe I've made. Doesn't particularly have a strong dragon fruit flavor, but it tastes pretty good anyway. The frosting is very sweet , so if you're not a sweets person I would recommend just using a store bought frosting. Overall very good, I was so pleasantly surprised and proud when it turned out so well.",
