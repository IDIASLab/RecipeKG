I also plumped the raisins (boil in water for a few minutes) used whole wheat flour and added more cinnamon nutmeg ground ginger and cloves to give it a spicier taste. I also used a combination of whipped and flavored cream cheese for a quick cream cheese filling. Tasty! Will make again!",

I mean I like a moist muffin but I don't want it to soak through the napkin! There was no noticeable spice/flavor the coconut was lost in everything else and although the cream cheese wasn't bad it didn't really do anything for the muffin. Also please note that these muffins DO NOT RISE well. So don't overfill the muffin cups in hopes of nice muffin tops - they'll spread flat across the top. That being said with much less oil at least double the spice (and perhaps additional spices as others suggested) this could be a nice muffin. I will definitely try again with modifications.",
