A couple of things... first when I mixed it up I thought it was a bad recipe because it was dry and crumbly for me no way I could roll this out but then I pressed it in a round pan and it baked up beautifully and it was so yum. Make sure and bake it long enough it tastes better to me a bit crunchy even though I am a lover of soft cookies. This serving size is a little bit ridiculous. 16 slices of this and a mouse would enjoy one slice. ha ha. So plan on eating 2 skinny slices at once! I will try whole wheat flour next time.",
