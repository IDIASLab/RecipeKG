I let it set in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors blend together. This was a wonderful dressing for \"Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta and Bacon\" from this site.",

I had frozen raspberries and they worked fine. I just blended all of the ingredients together in my Vitamix on medium speed about 25-30 seconds. I don't care for the raspberry seeds and they would get more processed that way. When I first tasted it, I thought it tasted way too acidic. I added a squeeze of agave syrup and it cut through that. Only other issue is the color. It has the color appearance of human blood, giving it that halloweenish appearance. So, basically, I would consider using a white plain or flavored vinegar, instead of the dark colored balsamic, if serving this to guests. For myself though, it was fine.",

I made half the recipe (you never know if you'll like it or not), and I made it as stated with the exception of the vinegar---I used half regular balsamic and half one that I found at HomeGoods recently--a white raspberry balsamic.  Initially I was afraid it would be too sweet with the sugar and the honey, but after it sat in the fridge for several hours, it mellowed out quite well for our tastes.  I will make this again for sure.  We really liked it!  I see other recipes now that would be wonderful using this recipe.  Thanks very much!",

I have also used almond oil instead of olive oil, or a combination of the two.  I have even, on occasion, added a tablespoon or two of toasted sesame oil.  Gives it a nice toasty flavor.
