Melt the butter first add the biscuits to cover most of the pan. We don't bother cutting and rolling into a ball. Be careful to keep flame low or you'll end up with burned biscuits quickly. Add pats of butter on top as needed as biscuits cook; flip one time as you cook. Roll the hot buttery biscuits in the cinnamon sugar. Delicious! The girls hover to make sure the get them hot and fresh! If you do cook the biscuits on a stick over fire I learned to sort of stretch the biscuit out and wrap it around the stick. You'll end up with a long twisted breadstick shape that will cook more evenly over the camp fire.",

The grands biscuits make a huge difference.",

We simply place a coffee can on a rack with 2-3 cups of canola oil inside. Make sure your rack is over the even coals. A raging fire will only be a disaster. Use the cheapest biscuits (10 per tube) and simply poke your finger in the center of each biscuit. We usually do this ahead of time and place them on a paper plate for easy access. Gently drop the biscuit in the hot oil. You can cook 2 at a time and use a marshmallow fork to flip them after they turn golden brown. Have a helper standing by with a brown lunch sack filled with 1 cup of sugar and some cinnamon to taste. Place hot donuts in bag close and shake. They are then passed around the fire and you are lucky if you even get one! Definately not a job for children though they do a great job of eating them up! We usually make 6 tubes and it goes pretty quick. I wear a headlamp so I can see them browning as it's usually a nighttime treat.",

We rolled them in to balls stretched them out and wrapped the roasting stick but found that cooking them in a pan over the fire in melted butter worked the best. I'm only giving it 3 stars because they only turned out half the time and talk about high cal/high fat. Doubt I'll make them again.",
