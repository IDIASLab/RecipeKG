WITH ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE: I followed this recipe exactly and watched the video, but the sausage was not even close to being done cooking when the rest of the pizza was finished, it was still completely raw. I now precook the sausage before putting it on the pizza. This dough is the best pizza crust I've ever had. I used Chef John's pizza sauce recipe and simmer an extra 30 minutes or so until very thick. TIP: If you opt to cut off the excess dough instead of folding it over, roll the extra dough and place it on top of the layered cheese and sausage, poke holes all over to allow steam to escape, then spoon pizza sauce over the dough with parmesan. Turns this (already fabulous) recipe into a Chicago style stuffed pizza like you\u2019d find at Giordano\u2019s!",

I watched the video which was very helpful Thank you to the reviewer who reminded to cook the sausage first! I used 1 tsp of salt and with all that cheese it was still a touch too salty for my taste so I'll use a little less salt next time. I'd also increase the corn meal to about 3/4 C for starters and use 5 cups of sauce. After reducing the 4 cups it seemed like barely enough. Thank you!!",
