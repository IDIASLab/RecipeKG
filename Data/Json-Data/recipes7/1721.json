Also, yes, you can sustitute butter and margarine out, AND cut back slightly if you choose. I add more cheese than the recipe calls for as well. The only other thing I wanted to say.... someone said they cut out the sugar. It's only a SMALL amount, and the sugar helps the flavor come out in the dish. Anytime you add sugar to a salty dish, it helps accentuate the flavor of your meal. I learned this from my grandmother as well. :) I hope I helped fix my recipe... there's no edit button. haha. Thank you for the wonderful reviews!\n\nAlyssa",

I usually don't make changes but due to the time I had and the ingredients on hand I altered it a bit.  I used 3 cups squash and some   carrots (steamed all veggies)just because we like lots of veggies.  I also used one box of cornbread stuffing mix (house brand ok) with the seasonings already in it then omitted the sage and salt and pepper.  I cut the margarine to 1/4 cup because we didn't need the extra fat.  I followed everything else and it was fantastic.  This is a real keeper.",

It had a lovely texture to it and was a warm and yummy side dish. This was a bit more complicated than I would like for a weekday meal-cutting and dicing and a 1 hour bake time involved. We did have one fairly big change to the recipe -not sure if it changed it much but (being in Canada) cornbread was not easily available so I used fresh white bread diced up and added about 2 tbsp of cornmeal in its place. It whipped up nicely and once the egg and soup mix were added the squash blended in nicely. The only other comment I would make is that I don't think the cheese was necessary as the side and top was a crispy brown and could have stood alone. Cutting the cheese would have cut the calories drastically -this being a side dish and the vegetable portion of our meal.",

I ended up using two small sized squash that I cubed and microwaved briefly in water to soften. I used a 10 oz can of cream of chicken soup and did not add the margarine. I made my own cornbread using Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread recipe here on AR and then used the same pan to bake this recipe. I think I would add more squash and less cornbread next time but I definitely will be making this again. I wish I had fresh yellow squash at Thanksgiving!",
