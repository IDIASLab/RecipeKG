I'm not big on chocolate chips in my food with the exception of chocolate chip cookies. Well, I can now add this recipe to the list. There was too much batter for my Bundt\u00ae cake pan so I used my angel food cake pan. This baked up so high (3 3/4\") and beautiful in the pan. It sliced up perfectly without crumbing up at all. I took part of the loaf to a young man at Butler University and sliced the rest and froze individually wrapped pieces to put in lunches. Jan, this is a winner!  MMMmm MMMmm good!!",

I replaced the chocolate chips with a container of Reese's Peanut Butter dessert toppings as it was all I had. Because the container was only 4 ozs. I divided the ingredients by 3. I followed Keni's lead and used my Wilton mini loaf pans because I wasn't sure how much batter there would be. 30 minutes baking time at 325 degrees was perfect. This made 3 mini loafs which is more than enough for Hubby and me. We certainly enjoyed this recipe Jan. You never let me down. Now to go put them in the freezer with my pretzel dogs!
