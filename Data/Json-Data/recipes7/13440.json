I\u2019m Native American and we just mix all purpose flour and water until you get a doughy consistency you make it about half and inch thick and as large as you\u2019d like. Then poke a hold in the center with your finger and make it about 1 cm around. Then just deep fry until golden brown. There is no need for such a long, drawn out recipe. No offense!",

I used an electric skillet set at 375\u00b0 and that worked very well. I poured in about a half inch of vegetable oil and set that to heat while the dough rose.  Again, that worked out just fine. I got about 16 pieces of bread out of the 6 cups of flour. The bread is delicious, and I was thinking maybe to serve it with strawberry jam. Thank you for the recipe!",
