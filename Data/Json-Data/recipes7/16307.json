Decided to make a caprese pizza using this crust recipe and it turned out great. I took the recipe down all the way to 1 serving and found it needed a little extra water, maybe a tablespoon or 2, but that will probably vary based on the thickness of the starter. Crust held up to all the moisture of the tomato and cheese, and had a good chewy texture and semi-sweet flavor. Better than I expected, and better than most homemade crust I've had made in such a short time!",
