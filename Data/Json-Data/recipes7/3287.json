If you love espresso and also love coconuts and almonds, then you should try this recipe. This is a delicious treat for any and all who love coconut, but we are going to spice them up just a little bit by adding espresso coffee flavor to these little coconut desserts. These mini espresso, coconut, and almond macaroons will melt in your mouth, and are made with just a few ingredients. These will take some time so you may want to make these in advance.",
