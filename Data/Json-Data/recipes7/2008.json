I used an equal mix of 4 tart apple varieties\u2014Pink Lady, Stayman Winesap, Granny Smith, and Arkansas Black. I cut the sugar way down--1 cup each of white and brown. However, I kept the spices exactly the same. Their flavor is strong but I liked it. You may wish to cut down. Not sure if your ratios will work the same, but for me, 1 pound of whole apples equaled one cup of finished product. I used 10 pounds of apples and my yield was 10 cups of apple butter. Also like the others, I did not need to cook it quite as long as the recipe states. For me, it was 6 hours on high, 9 hours on low, then added the sugar and spices and kept on low for 2 hours more with the lid off to make thicker. I used an immersion blender after the first 6 hours to make it smooth. I then canned the butter using a 10 minute hot water bath. It looks great and tastes awesome and I plan to give out as Christmas gifts.",

I used Arkansas Black apples (about 15 large) until my crock-pot was full and really couldn't hold anymore.  I also ended up mashing the apples after the first 8 hours and then I smushed everything through a wire strainer/sifter after it had cooked for about 22 hours.  I wanted a smoother texture.   I did end up cooking mine for about 25 hours just because I was trying to cook some of the liquid off to make it thicker (removed the lid the last 3 hours).

I only had 3 pounds of apples, so I reduced the remaining ingredients down so I was only making 1/4 of the original recipe.  What happened - my apple butter burnt in the slow cooker during the second cooking cycle (10 hours on low).  Any thoughts on why?  Not enough liquid, not enough ingredients for the large cooker, etc.?  Wondering if anyone else had the same type of experience thier first time out so I can figure out what I did wrong.
