Good in the summer and even better in the winter on a cold night. Can also cook it in the slow cooker. Then when you come home from work, all you have to do is either grill or broil them to brown them before serving. Serve with mashed potatoes or potato salad or egg noodles.",

These are the best tasting short ribs I have ever had and the recipe is easy to follow, easy make and even easier to eat. \n\nI served this wonderful meal with a nice tossed salad, homemade Au Gratin Potates, homeade buttermilk biscuits and homemade blueberry cheesecake. EVERYONE at the table couldn't stop raving about how delicious the dinner was.\n\nSo, if you are looking for fall off the bone deliciousness, do not hesitate, to make these ribs. Definitley a new favorite at our house. JOSH",

The best part? They're not at all labor intensive. I prepared the marinade and placed the ribs and marinade in the crock pot in the frig overnight. Then in the morning I simply turned on the crock pot and went to work. When we were ready to eat Mr. LTH grilled for few moments to impart some grill marks/smoky flavor. We don't keep horseradish on hand so I simply left that out. I couldn't find any beef ribs so we used a mixture of pork spare ribs and boneless pork ribs. While both were delicious we all preferred the bone in ribs to the boneless ribs. This WILL be a get together staple at the LTH house...nothing beats easy prep ahead of time letting the slow cooker do the work and very minimal work at service. THANK YOU so much for this recipe Cook'N'Gma!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm presently cooking this for the first time. I was looking for zero or low sugar content and this fit the bill. I have made certain modifications to the recipe and steps. 1) I added garlic, substituted dried parsley for the fresh, and added dried chives. 2) I saut\u00e9ed/browned the meat (boneless short ribs) before hand (no time to marinade) and then saut\u00e9ed the onions in the same oil after setting the ribs aside.  Otherwise, onions become rubbery and unpleasant to chew. 3) I set the four large ribs on top of the onions, and then I poured the sauce over the meat. it quickly came to a boil since I saut\u00e9ed the onions on med-high heat and I covered it and turned it down to #3 on my burner setting. Because I had no time to marinade, I will cook four 3 hours rather than two, checking the liquid content every hour. It smells wonderful and I'm so pleased to have found a BBQ sauce recipe so low in sugar, because I cannot have sugar in my diet as it is a trigger. I also like that it uses tomato sauce rather than ketchup, which is also quite high in sugar. I cannot wait to eat these short ribs.",
