It tastes like a Reuben sandwich without the corned beef. There was a bit too much caraway seed for my taste and I would've put the bacon on top to get more crispy as it baked. My husband also suggested frying the sauerkraut to take the edge off of it - too much vinegar taste I guess. Overall though I would say it was pretty good! And the longer I sit here munching the more the flavour is growing on me! Time to stop eating!;o) I would make this again with a few minor modifications.",

My store didn't have fresh yeast (apparently it's a \"seasonal\" item) so I used.25 ounce instant yeast. I also used 1/4 cup ghee instead of the full 1/3 cup clarified butter and whole milk yogurt in place of sour cream. I baked the tart in a pan on parchment for the first half of baking and then finished it on a baking stone for a good crisp crust. It's delicious cold for lunch too. Ausgezeichnet!",
