Here are some recommendations. Firstly instead of \"draining the water\" I saved the \"water\" aka CHICKEN BROTH after I boiled the chicken. You can use this for another recipe or if your recipe turns out too sweet or salty you can always use the broth to dilute it in the end which is what I ended up doing. Secondly I didn't have all of the ingredients so I made some substitutions. I didn't have oyster sauce so instead I used fish sauce. I also didn't have thick soy sauce but a great substitute is regular soy sauce and molasses which I added at the end. Since I used molasses I avoided putting white sugar in the recipe as well. This recipe is great over a bed of rice!",

I've been having this since I was a kid and I'm so glad that I finally got around to making it. Super easy! I added onions to the ginger and garlic omitted the carrots (I've never had taosi with carrots!) added portobello mushrooms slightly more water for sauciness and mixed the turkey and chicken breasts together. Also added thai peppers for that nice bite! Highly recommend giving this recipe a shot!! Five stars!",

I didn't bother draining the chicken after the initial cooking as there was not much water left. Instead I just added a bit more cornstarch (about 2tsp mixed with 2tsp water) to thicken it up. The sauce was excellent and the dish was a winner in our house.",
