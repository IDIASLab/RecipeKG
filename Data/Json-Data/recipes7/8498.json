I added a 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon, 2 teaspoons vanilla and used 4 bananas which I believe made it just that more moist and delicious (not to mention I had 8 bananas I wasn't going to eat and didn't want to throw away 2). I ended up making 2 loaves and added walnuts to one. Lastly, I used a metal pan coated with unsalted butter for each loaf, turned the oven off at 55-60 minutes and let it continue baking while cooling which prevented the burnt or hard outside while also not sticking to the pan. I will definitely keep this as a favorite and make it again!",

The outside crust got a little too done before the inside was done. The crust was just harder than would be ideal.
