I used the blueberry yogurt I had in the fridge (never buy plain yogurt) and I think the extra blueberry flavor was a great contribution.  I used Splenda rather than sugar, but since I was already using a sweetened yogurt I reduced the amount by half and the level of sweetness was just right.  I used frozen blueberries which not only makes this refreshingly cold but they're also handy to have on hand to make this at any time.  Incredibly blue and incredibly blueberry, Hubs rated this \"close to five stars,\" high praise from a guy who only allots five stars to the best of the best.",
