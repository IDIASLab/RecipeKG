I do have to say that these took a bit more time to make than I expected mostly because the batter was thick and sticky and hard to spread into the pan (I ended up spraying my hands w/ cooking spray to get it in there evenly and that worked fine). It's more like a half brownie half cookie to me but they are yummy nonetheless. The family really enjoyed these so I will def be making them again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
