I used SmartBalance spread instead of butter and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp or so.  I also used instant buttermilk powder & water.  **** I have a giant waffle maker that makes 4 large Belgian waffle squares at one time.  I was leary about the original yield of this recipe...only 3?  Who eats only 3 waffles in a family?  This recipe yeilded 8 big fat squares, not just 3.  Being pregnant, I ate 4 squares and my daughters each ate 3 between them...with 1 left for my hubby when he gets home.  lol! **** Anyway, this is a superb recipe.  Make sure to mix the egg whites in very well (gently).  Finding large egg white clumps is not the most pleasant experience.",

Also, my \"pinch\" of cinnamon is probably bigger than your average pinch would be. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. Out of a doubled recipe, I got 12 full sized regular waffles (and that means that I used one of those four-count basic wafflemaker and none of them were cheated out of batter). These waffles were crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. I served these with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which is also on this site. This was one of the top waffle recipes I've tried from this site, I think the buttermilk and the touch of cinnamon make this recipe.",
