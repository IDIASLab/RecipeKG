I thought as I was making it that there was just too much spice for an 8X8 cake but really there\u2019s not- the spices are just right! I did use a 9\u201d springform pan, greased the sides and used parchment paper on the bottom which worked out very well. I was able to easily move the cake to a decorative plate. The maple and cinnamon whipped cream is absolutely the perfect topper for this dessert. I did add a whipped cream stabilizer as there are just two of us and we won\u2019t finish it in one sitting. Thanks for sharing- it\u2019s a keeper!",

The maple whipped cream really does help it a lot. I just didn t like the texture of this cake. The taste was not bad but not good enough to make again. I made it mostly as written except I did not whip up egg whites and fold in. I followed someone else s advice on beating the whole eggs together in the batter. I didn t think that would matter as pumpkin pie filling uses the whole egg as well and is a custard. My husband liked it ok but did not rave about it either. Oh well you try some and some are good and some are not. I m going to try some pumpkin bars next. Fingers crossed.",
