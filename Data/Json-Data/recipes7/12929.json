I was expecting something a bit \"fruitier\" tasting so next time I'll just eliminate the water; as the ice melts diluting the fruit flavor will happen naturally. Hubs thought it was a little tart so I'll try cutting the lemon juice in half next time (admittedly all of this is personal taste preference). This was very refreshing and you don't need to worry about calories and fat (which is often the case with smoothies) so you can sip without guilt! GoodCook thanks for a great afternoon snack!",
