Anyway I used crescent rolls from a can made them into rectangles added a cream cheese and sugar mixture rolled then up and put the into the oven to begin cooking while I worked on the souffle part. Then I added the egg mixture and followed the recipe as given. My brunch guests and I were very happy with this one! I can see that this recipe would work well with lots of flavor variations!

I did find that there was some extra liquid in the bottom of the dish. My understanding is to use the blintzes frozen. Perhaps I'll try to thaw them next time and see if that makes a difference. If anyone has any ideas please comment. (Hint- check the International section of your store's freezers. That's where I find them. But cheese are popular; I got the last two while there were lots of fruit filled ones left.)",
