I used 3/4 C ice coffee (instant dissolved in a blend of milk / vanilla soy milk instead of water...this also accounts for the added milk) frozen banana (instead of banana ice) and about 1/2 C of ice cream. Looks like I forgot the chocolate syrup. Oops. Well it tasted great! A nice way to have your morning cold coffee but get in some fruit as well!! It's easily justifiable as healthy b/c of the banana...just ignore the 1/2 C of ice cream!;-)",
