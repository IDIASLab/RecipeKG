I made the recipe as it is written using whole milk and got some curds (about 3/4 cup) with remaining liquid that looked like 2% milk not whey. It seemed like I could get more out of it so I cooled the mixture down to room temperature then heated it to boiling again and added a tablespoon of white vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. It curdled beautifully leaving a clear whey and more solids than the first attempt. My advice is to go straight for the vinegar as the acidity of lemons may vary from one to the next. The paneer tastes excellent with a nice firmness that held its shape when cut.",

Lemon can be substituted with white vinegar especially if your lemons won't cause it to curdle. Toss some fresh cracked peppercorns into the curdled milk in the cheese cloth and stir before hanging for peppercorn paneer.",

Since all I had was 2 percent I substituted a half pint light cream for 1 cup of the milk. Also the yogurt I used was Stoneyfield Organic full fat with cream on top. So I added a little of the cream from on top of the yogurt;-) This did require more than one Tb of lemon juice in order to curdle but it all comes down to how acidic the lemon is I guess. The cheese is DELICIOUS (been nibbling at the curds that stuck to the cheesecloth... LOL) and firm enough to cook. Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe!",
