I topped the pears with a tablespoon of mascarpone before drizzling the sauce over the dish. Next time I'll us a bit of corn starch after removing the pears for a thicker sauce but I wouldn't change anything else. The sauce that this makes is AMAZING and would stand on it's own as a topping for ice cream or cheesecake which could make for some interesting pairings.",
