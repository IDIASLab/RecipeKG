It has all of the qualities of a GCC except you replace the bar of German chocolate with white chocolate ( I used Ghiradellis baking bar). It was fantastic, I never thought of using white chocolate instead but I\u2019m glad I found your recipe! I did make a white chocolate buttercream for the sides and piled the coconut pecan frosting on top, but that was just An aesthetic thing. Great recipe!",
