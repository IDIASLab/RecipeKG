I combined all the dry ingredients, melted the butter and added it to 1/2 the milk, then added the juice from the peaches to the batter until I could just about pour it into the dish. I topped the batter with the peaches and baked it about 45 mins.  It came out very good and I got raves around the table.  I will make this recipe again.",
