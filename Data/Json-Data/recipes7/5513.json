I am going to play around with the amount of sugar & honey, but the overall flavor is great.  I ended up using chicken breats (rather than wings).  I cut each chicken breasts into 4 pieces and cooked the chicken in the sauce for about 15 minutes.  Took the chicken out of the sauce (covered to keep warm) and then cranked up the heat, for about another 10-15 minutes, to thicken the sauce (be sure to stir more frequently as the sauce gets thinker).",

I did add a touch of cornstarch and when that wouldn't work fast enough a touch of flour- and that helped but these did not caramelize for me or get \"sticky\" as others had described.  When I finally served them to my husband who prefers fried wings, he was very disappointed that the skin was still soft and fat-like.  So, I threw the whole pan under the broiler for about 8-10 minutes then flipped for another 8-10 and my husband said \"they were saved!\"  So, the broiler thickened the sauce, the wings caremelized and darkened and the skin crisped up.  So, hopefully this helps others that may have had similar issues. Tasted very good in the end- fall apart tender- just took me a lot longer to get there!",

My husband was leery because he doesn't like \"weird\" food (peanut butter + soy sauce = weird in his book), but he ended up loving it!!  It was so disappointing when it was gone!  I used 12 drumsticks instead of wings because that's what I had.  I made the sauce as written, just tripled it to make sure there was enough for the drumsticks (no sesame seeds on hand though).  It was so very easy to do and the family's favorite meal in a long time!  This will be on a regular rotation!  It was *very* sticky, but worth it!\nWe served it with Japanese noodles and sliced bell peppers.  I'm going to try the sauce with shrimp or chicken over pasta or rice so we can eat it with a fork and it might be less messy.  It was oh so good!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe Shannon!",
