Other vegetables can be used and applied with the same fermentation process to produce a similar taste and different textures. In this recipe, I fry some kimchi to completely alter the taste and texture for a smoky doppelganger! It is so great with Korean barbeque and with plain old rice. It is certainly one of my favorites and so easy to make. Enjoy hot or cold! Sprinkle sesame seeds on top as a garnish.",
