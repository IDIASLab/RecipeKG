After reading all of the comments I think it is important to note that there can be a BIG difference between the \"asian\" store and \"american\" store version of your ingredients.   I know that most american versions of soy sauce have a lot more salt, so I am assuming the american version of oyster sauce is also a bit different.  We only use the asian store version for all of our ingredients, which is pretty close, if not sometimes the same brand, that they use in the restaurants.  So if it didn't turn out for you the first time, try making a stop into your local asian grocer and try again :)  ** And for some reason allrecipes changed my cooking instructions, but you do want to turn down down the heat a little once you add in the sauces to prevent burning and my beans actually take closer to 10 mins to cook to my desired tenderness. **",

For years, my family also made a Bee-line for the green beans at the Chinese Buffet - we could have made a meal on the beans alone.    Now, I can make them simply and easily right at home any time I want.   I used haricot vert green beans found at Sam's, and I did blanch them in boiling water for 3 minutes before sauting them.    I was also unsure of the oyster sauce, so I cut back a bit on that, but next time, I'll use the full amount the recipe calls for...  so good, so good!    ",
