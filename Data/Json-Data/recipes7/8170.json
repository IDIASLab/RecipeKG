That little bit of sugar and cream bakes into a lovely light caramel sauce which is just delectable when spooned over the baked pears.   This is divine, and I would definitely serve this as a finish to an elegant dinner (heck, any dinner, even beans and franks!). ***UPDATE 11.5.18***  This recipe ceases to amaze me.  How can anything taste this good with so little effort?  Pears are inexpensive right now, so today I knew it was time to make this again.  We enjoy these pears warm or chilled,",

I was so excited with the outcome: silky caramel sauce tender and sweet pears mmmmmmmm. Our guest was thrilled with this simply elegant dessert for his birthday away from home. I will share this with SO many people and make it many times again. Thanks Kaboom!",

Didn't change a thing other than to sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top along with the sugar, but just a personal taste preference. Once they came out of the oven, I took one to my hubby and walked back to the kitchen to get mine. All I heard in the other room was \"Wow!\"  Once I took a bite I knew what he meant!  2 weeks later I made these for dinner guests and they loved them as well.
