Sounds weird but when you have two kids five and under you need a quick breakfast that'll give you the energy you need. I did a little scaling down for one. I used a whole frozen banana which crossed out the need for ice cubes. I added orange juice instead of milk which crossed off the need for sugar. I added a little cinnamon for flavor. I also used nonfat sugar-free strawberry yogurt because that was the only yogurt I had. Eh. It was okay. Served the purpose and gave me the energy I needed. Don't know if I'll make it again but thanks for the idea.",
