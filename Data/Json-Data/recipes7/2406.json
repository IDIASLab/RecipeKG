I am an intermediate baker and found this recipe to be easy to follow and the end result was great. I omitted the nuts since we didn't have them on hand. We also didn't have coarse sugar -w hich the entire family agreed would have been better than plain old granulated sugar we used on top.  We put butter and honey on them and everyone had seconds. I can see us playing around with the add ins - I'd love to try with raspberries or blueberries. This recipe will go into the recipe box!",

Maybe it was my fault for using fresh peaches, but I needed to add almost 1 cup of additional flour to get this dough to come together so that I could pat it out and slice it.
