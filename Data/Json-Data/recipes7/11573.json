In my mind this was more a shallow cake than brownies but these were so good I don't really care what you call them. Moist packed with apples delicious as is with a scoop of ice cream or drizzled with warmed caramel sauce this was a real treat that was quick to prepare. Note: I prepared this with the conventional mixing method beating the butter and sugars until creamy adding the eggs (and a teaspoon of vanilla) then adding the combined dry ingredients (including a half teaspoon of salt). Update: Eat 'em quick! Even loosely covered the top was a bit soggy by the following morning!",

I used the recipe that was published in AR magazine  in April/May 2018 which is the same as this one, except it called for 1 1/4 c butter. Also, the magazine recipe called to brown the butter and then put the melted butter in the refrig to cool for 30 min., which I did.  Maybe that extra half stick of butter made the difference, but mine were definitely more blonde/brownie like than cake-like, which some reviewers mentioned. I only had one large Fuji apple, so it also had less apple in it than the recipe. However, I think the lower amount of apple kept them from being soggy or mushy the next day. I added a good half cup of walnuts. You can\u2019t beat the smell of browned butter, and I think the browned butter made these so delish. Baked exactly 45 min. Cooled about two hours. Absolutely wonderful, even the next day. Next time I might add some caramel chips.",

Next time I think I will up the sugar by 1/4cp. and cinnamon by another tsp. It could also use some walnuts or even butterscotch chips to give it a more rich flavor. It has the consistency of your typical apple muffin so perhaps putting a strudel topping on would be good too. It's a good recipe to play with.",

I had Fuji apples, so that is what I used.  I did not change any other ingredients, except to add a bit of salt and some vanilla extract.  I creamed the sugars with the butter, added the eggs; I combined the dry ingredients, added them to the wet, then stirred in the apples.  There is no way to fold in the apples, just get them in that batter the best way you can, because the batter is quite stiff.  The juice in the apples provides the moisture.  Be sure to use a very large bowl.  The bowl I started with was too small, so I had to transfer to the largest bowl I had.  I added about 20 extra minutes to the baking time, and the \"brownies\" were still quite moist in the middle, so rely on the actual toothpick test, not the minutes.  I added some whipped cream (ice cream would also be nice) and a drizzle of caramel sauce, which sent this already delicious recipe right to the moon!",
