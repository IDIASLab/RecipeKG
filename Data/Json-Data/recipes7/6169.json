Tip: Cream and Butter and sugars well - add the eggs one at a time incorporating each one then add your dry ingredients and just stir to combine. You don't want to develop the gluten in the flour. Spread into the pan and I baked for 30 minutes. Very tasty treat!",

The dough was very dry and literally had to be pressed into the pan - there was no way of pouring it.  The end result was very tough and they were only baked to the minimum time recommended.  My husband asked where the chainsaw was so he could cut them up.  I won't be making these again.  The recipe definitely needs something - at least some vanilla.",
