I think you could easily make 24 if you roll the dough out thinner, and I will next time. I will also remember that after the second rise, the rolls will double in size again in the oven, so leave plenty of room in the pan. Need to use a deeper pan or leave room around the edges, because when they bake the filling will melt and may drip out over the sides if you put too many rolls in there.",

Definitely a plan-ahead thing as there is a lot of time for rising of the dough but it's totally worth it. I used the \"perfect cinnamon roll icing\" recipe because I wanted cream cheese icing that was a bit thicker so I cannot comment on the maple icing but I will probably try it next time. My family said better than cinnabon in the mall. I would not skip the butter and sugar in the bottom of the pan if you are going for that Cinnabon buttery sugar crusted bottom but the rolls would be more bready on the bottom if you skipped it- i would at least put 1/2-1/4 of the sugar and butter on the bottom of the pan if you were going for less. I took the lead of another person that commented and used brown sugar in the filling instead of white and it turned out amazing. this will be my go too cinnamon bun recipe. The search is over!",

When I first started mixing the 8 cups of flour into the dough it worked out fine then when I was supposed to knead the remaining four cups into the dough it started to get super dry and I ended up having to mix at least 3/4 of a cup of water in to get the right consistency. Second when making the frosting at the end don't use four cups of sugar. After my flour incident I decided to add in three cups at first instead of the four that it said to add in the instructions and it still ended up incredibly dry. I had to add almost a half cup butter in for the consistency to be thin enough for me to pour over the finished cinnamon rolls. I hope this was valuable advice for anyone hoping to make this dish in the future.",
