        "description": "After I was diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity, I played around with various recipes so that I could not only eat food that worked with my system, but also enjoy it. I love this blueberry muffin almost as much as the original, all-purpose flour version, and the rest of my family can enjoy it too without feeling like it's a sacrifice. I generally use brown rice flour, but white rice flour may yield a fluffier muffin. I personally like the texture the cornmeal adds, but for a more traditional muffin, feel free to do all rice flour (maybe half brown, half white).",

The cornmeal gives a good texture that hides the rice flour texture. Instead of milk and vinegar I used some buttermilk and sour cream. I used half the butter and home grown freshly milled corn meal instead of bought cornmeal. Some batter didn't fit into my muffin pans so I made 'muffin tops' in a cake pan and the batter was stiff enough to make a very good muffin top too. I will be using this recipe without the berries to make cheese muffins and other variations. Thanks for this recipe!",

I found these muffins a bit dry for my taste and not quite sweet enough. The lemon zest was an excellent addition; gave them a bit of a kick. I drizzled the slightly cooled muffins with the juice from half a lemon mixed with sugar half a cup or so. I filled mu muffin cups to the top and got 14 and they were cooked in 16 minutes. I think I'll try them at 375 next time with something to moisten them up maybe some sour cream or applesauce added to the batter.",
