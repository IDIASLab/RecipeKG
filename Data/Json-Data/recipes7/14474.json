I think 9 servings is fair for this dish and that means each serving comes out to 366 calories per bar. Now on to the good stuff...I loved these! The crust was buttery and flaky. The cooked pineapple reminded me a little of an apple pie but the rum flavor came through. You could really taste the macadamia. I think these would be really good chilled as well! My only complaint is that the crust separates from the filling.",
