No \"fancy\" ingredients that I would have to substitute.  But, I did use 1 cup rice milk and 1/4 cup water instead of 1 1/4 cup water.  I found that spreading the batter evenly with the back of a spoon really enabled the pancakes to cook evenly and not stay uncooked in the center. Wonderful recipe. And to the reviewer who stated that just because this was a good vegan subtitute for \"normal pancakes\" that it wasn't worth 5 stars, I would like to disagree.  I don't think a regular buttermilk pancake is 5 star cuisine.  I feel that vegan recipes are just just as good, if not better than \"regular\" food.  They are much kinder to your health, the planet, and the animals who would have suffered for that buttermilk.  I think this compares to the best.  5 stars.",

After making the batter I thought it was too thick to actually make \"fluffy\" pancakes but I was wrong.  They came out very fluffy.  Also, I thought when making the batter that there was way to much sugar but added it all anyway.  I'm glad I did.  They were sweet but not everly so.

I would suggest pouring small amounts of the batter onto the griddle to make flat pancakes. Otherwise they turn out too thick and not cooked properly. I tried these with and without chocolate chips and both were good. However, the plain pancakes had a strangely buttery flavor that was very nice. Just because these are a good vegan substitute for normal pancakes, doesn't mean they are worth 5 stars. Regular buttermilk pancakes are worth 5 stars so we should always compare foods to the best, not just rate them 5 stars because they are \"good enough\" for vegans. So \"5 star vegan\" but \"3 star universally\"",

Finally, a basic recipe that we can easily convert to our alkaline nutrition lifestyle (i.e., no soy, wheat, etc.). My subs: spelt flour (1 1/2C), date sugar or dark agave syrup, himalayan salt, hemp oil, and no oil on our hot griddle (350^F). For each teaspoon of baking powder, I always sub 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice. Sprinkle a few fruit pieces on top after pouring for a treat. We also use the pancakes at supper with onions and green peppers sprinkled. Fluffy and delicious! Yum yum!!",
