I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and baked in the oven for 45 min at 375. I let the dough rise in the fridge bc I had made the dough late the night before so 45 min wasn't quite enough--I think it would have been if I had let it rise at room temp. I love that the top of the bread turns out dark and rustic looking. Very pretty bread! I didn't add the honey on top bc I want to use this as a sandwich bread but I'm sure it would be wonderful with it. I'll make again. Thanks for the recipe!",

It poofed up and smooshed against the top so it was still a little gooey on the top. Next time I will cut the recipe down to 10 servings and it should be fine. The bread itself is wonderful. I added a little ground ginger in addition to the cinnamon and doubled the fruit using raisins and cranberries instead of apricots. I will definitely make this again and am looking forward to different fruit combinations.",
