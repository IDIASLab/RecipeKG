I don't know what I did wrong because mine was not the pretty green color. It was the color of sand. Only change I made was making a half of a recipe to reduce the calories. It made plenty for one person. The banana I used was also frozen. I don't typically add that much yogurt or even need sweeteners in a smoothie. Going to work with the base here to see what I can come up with. I do not taste any fruit or even the vegetables really mostly just taste like liquified yogurt.",
