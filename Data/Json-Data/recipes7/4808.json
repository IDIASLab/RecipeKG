I'd never had pad see ew before and I was a little worried about the \"ew\" part. IT'S SO GOOD! Beef & broccoli meets pad thai! Fish sauce and oyster sauce aren't as nasty as they sound and you can get them super cheap ( 1/bottle) at an Asian grocer. I added rice vinegar and doubled the sauce (2 Tbsp rice vinegar 6 Tbsp oyster sauce 2 Tbsp fish sauce 2 Tbsp sugar). Also added 2 eggs instead of 1. Used a whole good sized crown of broccoli. Used \"round sandwich steak\" which is already cut thin. No salt just some black pepper. Try it you'll like it!",

The water and cornstarch slurry is not needed.  If you use brown sugar in place of white and do not use to much soy and other sauces a nice sauce will emerge in the end.  Also no need to pre cook the broccoli, simply stir fry it the let it simmer in the sauce while meat cooks.  Also no need for another extra dirty pan with cooking the egg, just push all ingredient aside while still stir frying and add egg too wok and quickly scramble in same pan.  Also, where is the fresh cilantro to toss in at the end and the traditional thai chili sauce?  A lot of extra work and missing ingredients.",

I used this recipe as a jumping off point following it mainly for the ingredient proportions. Instead of beef I used chicken and gai lan instead of broccoli. I also found some fresh rice noodles at an Asian market (see photo). I used the sauce ingredients as listed but added 1 T rice vinegar. Technique-wise I stir fried the broccoli and set it aside. Then I stir fried the chicken added the noodles then the sauce. Once they were heated through I added the beaten egg. When the egg was cooked I folded in the broccoli. It turned out well and my daughter approved (she ate 2 servings!).",

Like some of the other reviewers I added a bit of sesame seed oil and rice wine vinegar. I also added a heaping teaspoon of prepared asian chili sauce to the liquid ingredients. At the end I put in chopped scallions and a bunch of thai basil. The end result was delicious but you do need an extremely hot pan and lots of oil...I used a combination of grapeseed oil and coconut oil...oils that can withstand a very high heat. I also have an induction range and put it at the power setting which is hotter than most conventional settings can get. This high heat is what sears the noodles and gives the dish that distinct flavor. I would omit the cornstarch altogether next time since the high heat and starches from the noodles absorbs all the liquid. I've tried a similar recipe but w/o the high heat and adding chicken broth as a way to keep the noodles from sticking to the pan. This did not turn out. The trick here is to use a seasoned pan extremely high heat and lots of oil.",
