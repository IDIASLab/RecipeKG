This fills my craving for them even though it is layered and baked. I served this with basic Puerto Rican white rice and a garden salad with avocado. The meat filling can be made in bulk and frozen in batches for future use. Delicious!",

I used Goya frozen prepared plantains (3 pkgs) just thawed them and laid them on the bottom put the meat mix on top and put another layer. I covered the casserole with one egg beaten with water (1TB) before baking. I made a few changes to the meat mix--I sauteed a sm onion in with pork and used fresh garlic. I wanted more of a picadillo flavor so put in a cpl TBs of vinegar a healthy pinch of cinnamon and 1/2 c of currants (didn't have raisins) into meat mix. I did not use the ham. I think I will try beef next time as that is more traditional. Will make again and again! DH had thirds!",
