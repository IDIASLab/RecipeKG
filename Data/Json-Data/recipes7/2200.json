I bet any flavor of jam/jelly/preserves could be delicious, as well as any combination of nuts but I did use apricot/walnut this time.  My pan size was a lot smaller than this recipe suggested, so rather than make my dough rolled extra thick, I just did five thin layers of dough instead of three.  Also, I put both a thin layer of apricot followed by a sprinkling of nut mixture on top of each layer of dough.  The end result was so pretty with the stratified layering effect and various hues of golden color.  I'll definitely be making this dessert again sometime.  p.s. I did not have sour cream, so used plain yogurt instead and it seemed to work great.",
