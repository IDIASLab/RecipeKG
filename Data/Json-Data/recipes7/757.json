First I stirfried a bunch of veggies, I used zucchini, broccoli, red/green pepper, onion, garlic, mushrooms. Then I added in the strips of tofu (skipped the corn starching step, just threw it in plain) and stir fried that in with a splash of soy sauce and spoon of chili garlic sauce and salt and pep to taste. In a separate pot I made the orange sauce, I did NOT add in sugar however I did add in a 3 caps of white vinegar. I also mixed the cornstarch in the warm water and added it in to oj/soy sauce/vinegar mixture when it came to a boil. After adding in the cornstarch I let the sauce simmer for a couple of minutes and then I added it to the tofu and veggies. Served with some brown rice this was an relatively easy and healthy dinner, will make it again. ",

                "reviewBody": "This is sure to please even tofu skeptics. It's very good but not great. The cooking time is a little off. My tofu slices were about a 1/2 inch thick and with a standard wok it took at least 20 - 25 minutes to fry it all. The sauce took me about 20 minuts to make as well. I added chopped red pepper which added additional crunch color and sweetness. Since I didn't have chili paste I used a tablespoon of sweet chili sauce. I also added 2 dried diced red chili peppers since other reviewers said the sauce wasn't spicy enough but it was too HOT so next time I'll just use one. I used about double the corn starch since I like the sauce thicker. In addition I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce because it is not enough to cover all of the tofu plus rice noodles. I would recommend not putting the tofu back into the wok. If you just place tofu slices on top of the rice noodles and spoon the sauce over the top the tofu stays nice and crunchy. Finally I served this with some fresh pineapple on the side which really complemented the dish quite nicely.",

Make sure tofu is not dripping wet when you batter it or it will turn the cornstarch from a powder into liquid. My supermarket did not have chili paste so I used tobasco saude and a little chili powder. Next time I will use the chili paste gotta go to the oriental market to get that. I recommend that you split the tofu into 2 portions and then fry them one section at a time. This makes it much easier to manage turning the tofu over to brown on both sides. Took me about 10 minutes per side. I used fresh mushrooms and brocoli instead of the carrots. I think you can use any vegetable you want just eye ball the right amount volume wise which is easy to do once you see the amount of sauce. Defiantely double the amount of sauce. Yumskers!!!",

I used shaghai noodles which really brought out the flavour. So even though I changed the recipe around a bit it was fantastic and I give it 5 stars for the sauce and the adaptability. YUM!",
