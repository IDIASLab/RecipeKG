First 2 cups of blueberries is barely enough to barely cover the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. I opted to use a 9 x 6 pan and 3 cups of blueberries. My mistake was not reducing the amount of batter (topping) - after baking 30 minutes at 400 the top looked beautiful but the topping was not done. I tented it with foil reduced the heat to 325 and baked another 15 minutes. The topping is very cake like and even with 3 cups of berries there still wasn't quite enough blueberries. I would recommend using the 9 x 13\" pan called for and increasing the blueberries to 4 - 5 cups.",
