The oil and sugar separated despite having stirred it contantly to combine and not burn the sugar so instead of pouring the separated mess over the seeds I grabbed a paper towel and soaked up the unwanted oil and poured the rest over the seeds. I think it needs salt and the chili powder is so miniscule it's not spicy at all either the amount of chili powder needs to be increased or use cayenne pepper instead of chili powder (if I make this again I think I'd rather use cayenne). Overall it was fun to try something new.",

I just poured all of it over the pumpkin seeds but was disappointed with how the sugar (now caramel) made clumps of some of the seeds and didn't seem to coat most of the others. I think the problem was that my seeds had cooled so this recipe should note that the seeds have to be hot or warm probably straight out of the oven to stop the caramel from clumping when poured on them. Also the seeds didn't seem very spicy with the chili powder so I added cayenne to the batch to make it a little hotter (per another reviewer's suggestion). Overall this recipe has potential but is woefully incomplete or incorrect as is.",
