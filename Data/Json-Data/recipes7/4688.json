I now use Panko crumbs on top for a real crunch & cut way down on the sugar to about 1/2 cup.  Also, Splenda works well.  Try it!!",

Some variations I've seen included 1 cup of sweetened coconut, a can of drained Mandarin orange slices, chopped pecans, a small jar of maraschino cherries drained and cut in half, and a half bag of mini marshmallows. I've seen it served at everything from Sunday family dinners to dinner on the grounds at churches to family reunions to funerals and weddings to neighborhood potlucks and it is ALWAYS one of the first dishes to disappear. That many Southerners just can't be wrong. You should try this. This base recipe is the same at every occasion ENJOY!",
