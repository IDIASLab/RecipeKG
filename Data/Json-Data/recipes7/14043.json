                "reviewBody": "10.16.16  Cleaning out the cabinets and ran across a can of peach pie filling which needed to be used up.  So I sub\u2019d the peach for the apple pie filling and cut back on the amount of brown sugar (that\u2019s just a personal taste preference).  IMO there\u2019s one thing wrong with this, and it does affect the outcome of the dessert... the size of the baking dish.  The pie filling barely covered the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish (maybe there's a typo and this should be 2 cans?), and what I ended up with was a dessert that was about 1/2\u201d high and just a bit dry.  This needs to be baked in a much smaller dish, maybe 8x8, so you really get a spoonful of the fruit and the topping.  This is a very easy recipe to make and does taste good, but I think it would be much better if baked in a smaller dish, and that's certainly an easy thing to change.  Emi M, thanks for sharing your family recipe.",
