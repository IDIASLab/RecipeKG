                "reviewBody": "I would like to clarify a few things about this recipe: The blueberries can be strained out if you prefer just an infused simple syrup. I have found that a some of my children like the blueberries left in and some prefer not to have any, the choice is yours. The syrup will be thin and then depending on how you intend to use it, you can thicken it with a cornstarch + water combination. If you want to infuse a batter, then the original consistency should do fine (all things considered), however if you want to drizzle this over pancakes or waffles and want something closer to the consistency of pancake syrup then you should thicken this. Refrigerating this overnight will also help thicken the consistency slightly. A simple syrup by convention has equal parts sugar and water, however if this is too sweet for your intended use, and you make it again, don't forget to embrace the spirit of cooking and alter/add your own spin. Enjoy!",
