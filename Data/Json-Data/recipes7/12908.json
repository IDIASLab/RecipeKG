        "description": "Tender pulled chicken with a southern white sauce. This wonderful pulled chicken has the perfect balance of seasoning with a hint of Alabama BBQ. The sauce is not overly powerful but you can always add more or leave it off and still have a great tasting pulled chicken for sandwiches or plain. I searched and searched for an easy slow cooker pulled chicken recipe that would be similar to a popular BBQ restaurant. I never found one, so here's my own recipe. My family of six loves this. Keep remaining sauce refrigerated until ready to serve. Great to spread on sandwich, lettuce leaf, or drizzle over chicken on plate.",

Just amazed at how great the sauce tastes on the chicken recipe. I also used Tricolor Rotini \"Ronzoni Garden Delight\" to serve the chicken dish on with a side Deli vegetable salad and garlic bread. I got the idea to use Rotini and the vegetable salad from one of the other reviewers thanks!! As she said I too had a lot of leftovers probably for 2 more dinners reheat or to make into another whole other dinner idea. Very easy and cost effective and really yummy!!! What more could you ask for for a great recipe!",
