And this isn't self-praise, this is certified by third parties. This recipe is perfectly forgiving. Let's begin:\nI used gluten free flour, measuring it first then sifting three times (to keep it light and fluffy, like regular cake flour). As I added it to the batter, I realised it was much more than 3 cups. \nI bought the wrong kind of cheese, so I ended up having to use mascarpone instead. \nNothing was at room temperature. \nI ran out of sugar halfway through, so only used 2.5 cups having to open little packets of sugar taken from a hotel room that I had rolling around in my purse. \nI realized, at the very last second, that I didn't have any almond extract, so I watered down some marzapane and added that.\nI couldn't decide if I wanted this cake or the submitter's other pound cake with chocolate chips, so I made both in one. I added some chocolate chips to each layer of batter.\nI ate about 1/3 cup of batter raw-it was really good. The cake was smaller than it should have been, so I didn't cook it for as long as I should have. Then after about 10 minutes I pricked it with a toothpick and it was still doughy inside, turned the oven back on and baked it for another 15 minutes.\nI mean, in theory, this cake should have bit the big one. Instead, it was moist and delicious.\nThis recipe ROCKS! Thank you for sharing it.",
