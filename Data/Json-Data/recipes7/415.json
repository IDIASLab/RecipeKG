It adds volume so you will have more servings as well. Just beat 2 egg whites until light peaks form and then whisk them into the syrup/lemon juice/mineral water mixture. I then poured the mixture into my ice cream maker and allowed it to mix for about 25 minutes. I still had to freeze it for at least 4 hours. My ice cream maker didn't harden it enough to sorbet consistency. But once it was frozen...it was awesome!",

After 20 minutes in my ice maker I added a bit of citron vodka (couple of tbp...maybe 3) The alchohol content keeps the sorbet from freezing roch kard once you place it in the freezer (I hate that!).
