I used shredded cheddar cheese and added it slowly into the mixing cycle making sure it didn't clump and it turned out fine.

Thawed & reheated it is just as flavorful and tender/chewy as it was the day I made it. Awesome bread! Original review 4/17/07: This bread is delicious. I made it manually and I adjusted the ingredients by adding dill seed & dill weed and smoked sweet paprika; I did not add cayenne marjoram or basil. I used butter instead of margarine and I chose an Amber Bock dark lager. The texture was slightly chewy and the bread was fragrant with the cheese and beer aroma--made the kitchen smell wonderful.",
