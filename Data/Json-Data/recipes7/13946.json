This puts air into itwhich makes it very light and greatly increases the volume - similar to wglhipped cream ir meringue. It also accounts for the pale white color. Using an electric hand mixer set on medium works great. I highly recommend using a double boiler setup to avoid scrambling the eggs. I made with 4 yolks and it was plenty for 4 deserts with a bit left over.",
