I doubled the batch and only ended up baking 18 cookies after tasting them throwing out the rest. I'm sorry I don't like posting negative reviews:(",

This was such a special and beloved recipe that my mother-in-law would not share it outside of the family. (I guess the cat is out of the bag now.) This recipe is perfect as is. No additional flour is needed just a well floured board and delicate handling. Do not substitute cinnamon for the nutmeg. The nutmeg lends a wonderful flavor that compliments the strawberry filling nicely. They do spread a bit. I use probably closer to a 1 1/2 inch round cookie cutter. When first baked these are a little crispy on the edges but if you freeze them in single layers separated by wax paper they are nicely soft when defrosted. Wonderful wonderful recipe!!!!!",
