I just made it yesterday and it tastes great. I took 4 russet potatoes, peeled & diced, boiled them in salted water just until they gave when pierced with a fork, then drained them and let them cool before following with the rest of the recipe. Even though it was good slightly warm, I think it tastes best when you  let the flavors marry overnight before serving.",

I used medium shell pasta for the macaroni, Hellman's mayonnaise for the dressing, and I skipped the pimiento (didn't have any). I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. This salad is amazing!! It came out very soupy at first, but after it chilled a while, it thickened up perfectly. I rinsed the noodles in warm water instead of cold, which helps them absorb the dressing better. Thanks for the great recipe, Timsgal. It's a new favorite!",
