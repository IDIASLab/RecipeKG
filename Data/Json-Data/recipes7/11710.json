                "reviewBody": "I liked this cookie and would recommend it for a Christmas tray. The combination of 2 chocolates, pecans, and cranberries went well together as suspected. I used sweetened cranberries and chopped a Bakers white chocolate bar, due to preferring the texture of white chocolate that has cocoa butter actually in it. Just baked they reminded me of a chewy chocolate chip cookie. Later, as they cool and are iced, they start to take on a mini bite sized scone taste. I honestly liked them without the icing, but it adds that holiday look if need be. I found that the icing equaled 1/2 tsp per cookie, if that helps. I didn't need 54 cookies. So, I used the change servings button and changed the recipe from 27 to 9 servings. I was able to yield 18 cookies, or 1.5 dozen, making that change. I baked them on a parchment lined sheet pan sprayed with PAM cooking spray. They took 14 minutes to bake.",
