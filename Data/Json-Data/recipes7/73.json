This makes the green beans softer.\nServe with feta cheese and bread for that extra something! Perfect.",

This time I followed to the letter, except I upped the garlic to 5 cloves, used an extra tomato, and added about 1/4 of broth (I would have liked to use white wine, but had none).  I simmered the beans for a solid hour, maybe an hour + 10 min.  Also sprinkled a generous amount of parsley.  What a nectar the sauce became... I could hear my Greek father's voice telling me to soak it all up with bread.  And this dish is not complete with a big chunk of feta cheese on the side.  Delicious!  But for those who omit the sugar, beware--it serves the purpose of balancing the acidity of the tomatoes.  Just a little goes a long way.  I actually cut out 1/2 a tsp from the recipe, and it was just right.  Yaya would be proud!!!",

You should use two small onions, 4 ripe tomatoes, and a whole head of sliced garlice for these beans -- one clove is definitely not enouh.  A note to the other reviewers that do not like this recipe after cutting back on the oil - the name of this recipe in Greek translates to \"Oily Beans.\"  You must add the oil to get the flavor, then do not transfer the oil to the plate when serving.  This dish must also rest for a period of hours to meld the flavors - as with most Greek dishes.  Parsley should be added and the addition of oregano is a big no no.  This is a main course, typically served with feta cheese and bread.",
