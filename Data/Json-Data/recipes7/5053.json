A great way to use leftover plums. 1 cup of all-purpose flour is fine if you don't have whole wheat - it worked for me! I tried this with gala apples but the apples came out pretty dry shriveled and flavorless. Will experiment with other apples. I tried this with nectarines too - delicious! I dipped each nectarine slice in some honey before I placed them on the dough then added the cinnamon and sugar. They came out beautifully golden and sweet!",
