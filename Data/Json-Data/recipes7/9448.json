There isn't any in the recipe. Another blamed the recipe for being too watery whereas another person who had that issue knew it was because of the altitude and adjusted. Don't you think you should be aware of the effects of altitude before you cook? Alternatively, runny pancake batter is necessary if you want pancakes with a larger diameter. \n\nPersonally I thought these were great and I wish I could have made them as written as I think they would have been just as good that way if not better.\n\nI added blueberries because my son insisted. I also realized too late that I was out if canola oil (which is my oil of choice for pancakes) so I used raspberry infused olive oil in the batter and cooked the pancakes in butter. I figured cooking them in the fruity olive oil might be too much.\n\nI will definitely save this recipe and next time I make it, I'll only add the blueberries to my son's pancakes and make sure the recipe holds up!",

If you try this recipe, make it as written before making judgement or changing for what you think is wrong or how pancake batter should be.  The batter IS thin, but the pancakes do puff up (although, not sky high) so don't add flour until you have tried as written. They also will bubble up (one reviewer said they did not).   Some reviews talked about \"soda\" - HUH?? - where does it say \"soda\" which would completely ruin this pancake.  It uses \"baking powder\" NOT baking soda!!  They are sweeter than most pancakes so I don't understand how anyone can say they are \"bland\"???  Usually when I make pancakes, I just Pam my griddle once, but these seemed to need another spray or oiling - probably because there is so little oil in the batter.  It was obvious a reviewer or more, reviewed on reading, not cooking and that is SO wrong and arrogant!  I once had a friend say that when she tried a new recipe, she followed it exactly, but after that it belonged to her to change as she desired.  Reviewers here should adopt that philosophy as reviewing after making changes is unfair.  (There, got that off my chest! :)",
