I made one minor change to the directions on this marmalade because  I have been making jam for years and years so after I added the pectin, I removed the pot from the heat and stirred and skimmed for 7 minutes instead of turning the pot to a simmer and cooking an additional 7 minutes with the pectin added to the pot.This is what I do with the other jams and marmalades that I have made. I also didn't use the hot water bath in the recipe. I sterilized my jars by washing them in hot soapy water and rinsing in clean water, then I placed them in a pre heated 225 degree oven for 10 minutes. I washed the lids the same way and boiled them for 1 minute to sterilize. I poured the hot marmalade into the warm jars and immediately put the lid on and tightened. I have used this sterilization method for years and found that it is so quick and easy. This recipe made 2 1/2 500ml jam jars for me.",

We boiled it for 3 hrs in hopes the pieces would disintegrate but they didn't. We added copious amounts of extra water for the long boil. Adding more water to create a reasonable consistency on the second day still left crunchy bits. In order to salvage the batch we fished out the floating cubed bits and added 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup orange juice. We also used powdered pectin when we added the sugar rather than liquid pectin. It is delicious. I would like to give zero stars because you should find a different recipe but the smallest number allowed is 1",

Don't include them in your mix. That said after I fished out the hard parts and the fiber I made some great jam from the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I really liked this recipe but it didn't set up terribly firm in my jars -- maybe my liquid pectin pouches are smaller than the ones used? I didn't think they would be I just used a pouch of Certo liquid pectin and I find I tend to have this problem with liquid pectin in general... I'm debating whether or not to open all my jars and re-boil to get a more jelly marmalade. I did open one and try some on bread and it was so delicious the way it is! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly but I was very careful when shredding the ginger to stop when my piece was too fibrous to properly grate any more... I think this contributes to a possibly stringy/crunchy marmalade people experienced. I also think using a food processor for the grating might let some of those fibrous pieces sneak in. I didn't cut very much of it into cubes as I was paranoid of a woody piece of ginger making it into the pot. The only change to the recipe I made was I added a few thinly sliced rings of a small orange for a bit of variation. It's nice to see little flecks of orange in the jars. I also added a bit of green dye to make some jars into festive gifts for the holidays and those are very pretty -- otherwise the marmalade turned out a lovely bright yellow. It's a bit of a labour-intensive project but it is so tasty! I'd make this again but I might use powdered pectin to see the difference. ETA: This recipe as-is has grown on me! Just know it's not as firm as a \"jelly\" but not at all bad very tasty",

I've made it a few times and once when toying around with the sugar content it came out quite liquid-y.  No problem!  A couple tablespoons of the syrupy version stirred into hot water tastes amazing (especially when you have a cold!).  I also added it to carbonated water once to make ginger ale when my husband felt sick and we didn't have ginger ale at home.  The original recipe is awesome, though!  Thanks.",
