I often substitute butter for shortening, but I didn't for this recipe, and I am very glad.\n\nI found them best after they had fully cooled.  After about a day, the outside was crunchy and the inside was like a chewy brownie.  The marbling of powdered sugar as the cookie expanded got lots of good reviews from my cookie eaters.\n\nThese are also fun to make with kids, as rolling the dough balls leaves a chocolate film on the hands -- slightly messy, but enjoyable!\n\nThis one is a keeper, but...  follow the recipe!

We substitute 1/2 C cocoa plus 4 Tblspn shortening for the chocolate squares, and we don't add the baking powder. I tried that in there, and made no difference to the cookies. Baking on Parchment is a MUST - so much easier! OMG try Dark Cocoa instead and WOW yummy dark chocolate cookies!",

I followed exact but added a bit more flour because some people mentioned they spread mine did not at all! The key to this recipe is to make sure your dough is COLD when rolling (chill at least 3 hours) and do not OVERCOOK. I only baked mine for 12 mins (and my cookies were big - I only got 3 doz out of this recipe) then allow to cool on the cookie sheet for 5-10 mins then remove to cooling rack until completely set. They may not look completely done when you take them out but if you overbake these they will be so dry and awful. And my kids had a ball rolling in the powdered sugar...so this is a keeper!",

Do not overcook these cookies, they should be lightly crisp around the edges and soft and gooey inside.
