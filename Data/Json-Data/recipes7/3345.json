Most homemade sorbets resemble an icy slushie, but this one is thickened before freezing, yielding a melt-in-your-mouth treat that will please even the pickiest sorbet lover!  Dually great because it can be made in an ice cream freezer, or in your regular freezer.",

I've been using All Recipes for years now, but this is the first recipe I felt strongly enough about to actually rate and review. This really does turn out just like store bought sorbet - which is getting harder to find in my area. Just what I was looking for!",

I don't have an ice cream maker so I froze it in a freezer container until solid then scooped it back into my blender and re-blended it and then re-froze it. REALLY good though I think the sweet could be cut back by at least a quarter next time. That's not a deal breaker though.",

Less sweet berries will require less lemon juice and I would only use 1.5 Tbsp max but that is my preference. It does need some no matter what. Also you will find that substituting 2 Tbsp of the sugar with 2 Tbsp corn syrup will produce an even silkier texture. And dressing each serving with a small amount of chiffonaded fresh basil not only adds color but a nice flavor complement as well. Thank you Dana for a terrific recipe I will use again and again!",
