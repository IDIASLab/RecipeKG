I halved the recipe used reduced-fat/lightened ingredients where possible and steamed the cauliflower for about 2-1/2 minutes in the microwave. The addition of the sour cream and that little bit of sugar really make this taste different. Honestly I couldn't tell I was even eating cauliflower it just blended so well with the chopped eggs and the texture was about the same. This was a pleasant surprise and I definitely will make this again.",
