I have made it several times, and I think now that the overall amount of the sauce should be increased by about 50%, and the OJ increased by double.  This may leave you with extra sauce (maybe for chicken salad tomorrow?), but you are able to add sauce to acquire the \"wetness\" that you want in cole slaw.  Good stuff !!!",

Sure the balsamic tinted this slaw an odd color....lol....but it was delicious!I also love the addition of the orange juice. Next time I will add some orange zest as well to bring out that orange flavor. I also added some green onions to this and used a store bought slaw mix. Excellent with shredded BBQ pork! Thanks!",
