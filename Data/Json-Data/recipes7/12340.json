I haven't tasted it yet but (in order of importance to me) these are the things that haven't worked: it didn't get swirled all that happened was a light brown layer over the dark brown of the brownie. All the butterscotch chips melted into a hard chewy lid under which the brownie was still raw. All of it boiled over some 20 minutes into the baking and I had to remove it from the oven transfer some to a smaller dish and pop it back in. The cooking time was way way more than stated. It got stuck to the side and bottom of the dish. After all this I'm wishing I'd just made regular brownies and saved the cream cheese for a different dessert.",
