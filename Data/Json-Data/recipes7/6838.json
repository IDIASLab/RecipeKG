First I made 1/4 recipe & baked in 5 ramekins for 25 minutes (what person looking for a \"healthy\" cheesecake needs a full cheesecake?). I used low fat cinnamon graham crackers and Greek yogurt in place of both the sour cream and butter. Increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon. Used skim milk. Cut the sugar to 2/3 & added Splenda to make the full amount of sweetener. All of these changes made for 5 yummy creamy 230 calorie servings. It doesn't taste like a full fat cheesecake but for those of us who have developed leaned-down tastes it still tastes heavenly with some fresh raspberries. My husband enjoyed his with a little melted chocolate in top. No complaints from him either.",
