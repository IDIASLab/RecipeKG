Made my own garam masala using a recipe for the spice mix, blended fresh ginger and garlic to make paste and used sriracha hot sauce instead of red pepper paste. Also used fresh almonds stuck in a blender with some oil instead of the cashew paste and only milk (no half and half). My only issue is that it turned out very dull in color. I was expecting bright orange/red and it was sorta peach/pink. Maybe use tomato paste instead of sauce?",
