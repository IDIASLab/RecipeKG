I didn't even realize this was published...I had the honor of making this wonderful salad before it became 'kitchen approved', and here's what I had to say: WOW, Molly, this is FANTASTIC! I used white basalmic vinegar instead of regular b/c I just got some and wanted to try it out, but that was my only change. The flavors of this are wonderful and fresh! Hubby usually doesn't like these 'ramen' type salads, but he raved over this and called the leftovers to take to work for lunch tomorrow, so that's saying a lot, lol. I actually had to stop myself (and hubby, lol) from eating this...YES, it's that good! This is gonna be a new side staple for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, Molly! :)",

Here is a copy of my original review before it was published..What a wonderful salad my slaw mix was only 12oz. so I added in some more shredded carrots. I didn't have any cashews or sunflower seeds but it was just fine without them. My whole family loved it and my sons had their gals over...they finished it off. My college kids eat Ramon noodles all the time and gave me a tip for breaking them up. Crush the noodles really good with the package unopened it was much easier than after it was opened. Thanks Molly another winner in my recipe box.",

My store only carried 10 oz bags of broccoli slaw so bought a bag a trislaw (carrots cabbage and broccoli) and tossed in a big handful of that too.
