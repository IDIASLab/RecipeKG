The filling was more than adequate to fill the pie and the crumb topping did not all fit on. Next time, I would cut down a bit on the sugar in the filling, but there are no other changes I would make. The cinnamon and nutmeg are nice in the filling. Put the pie on a cookie or abking sheet, as the filling drips out a bit. I would definitely make this again. Thank you!",

I also cut down on the topping, as another reviewer said it made too much.  Even after cutting it by about 1/4, I still ended up with about twice as much as I actually used, so I am saving the rest for future use on muffins or something.  I also omitted the pecans as I didn't have any, and really don't like them much anyway.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.",

I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping and cut it down just a bit, maybe by about a quarter, and since I had room in the pan I just went for it and put it all on even though reviewers said it was quite a bit even when cut down. But who doesn't love crumb topping, right?? It was lovely, I wouldn't do it any other way. The cinnamon, nutmeg, and pecans add such a nice, rich flavor to the rhubarb and strawberries.
