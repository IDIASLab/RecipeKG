The reason the cinnamon taste was so strong may be that I use a very high quality cinnamon.  They were still good, but I would cut back to two teaspoons of cinnamon the next time; and as stated they were light and fluffy.",

I did only use a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon only because I didn't want that to overpower the rest of the pancake and I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil only because I'm low on oil until payday. These turned out just wonderful! I served these with a homemade maple-vanilla syrup (which is also from this site) and it was just heaven.
