I had no issues with the cookie flattening although, as I always do with a butter-based cookie dough, I chilled the dough until somewhat firm before baking.  I substituted cinnamon chips for the chocolate chips and, truth be told, I prefer them here as the combination of chocolate and cinnamon never much appealed to me. Hubs and I both agree, however, that the cookie was a little heavy on the chips and on the oats.  I\u2019m thinking less oats (or a little more flour) and maybe even a tad more sugar would make these softer and a little more moist.",

I substituted half the butter with butter-flavored shortening so the cookies wouldn't bake too thin, as I read other reviewers state.  Flattening before baking at 350 for ten minutes, they came out perfect...not too flat, but not like a cake, either.  The outside was lightly crisp, while the inside was soft and chewy. Will definitely be making these again!",
