I used 5 small/medium Fuji apples two large stalks of celery 1.5 cups of grapes and 1 cup of dried cranberries. I left out the pear and raisins and used 3/4 cup of walnuts instead of the almonds. I followed the dressing instructions fairly closely except that I used fat-free mayo and reduced all the ingredients by around 1/3. (I also tossed the chopped apples with the lemon juice so they wouldn't brown.) I appreciate a recipe that can be tinkered with this much and still turn out so delicious. The cinnamon was a great touch. The salad was almost too sweet so I'd recommend taking care with the sugar especially if you use the full amount of raisins and dried cranberries.",

Well all recipes is where I turn to when I want to quickly find a recipe. This one sounded yummy except I didn't have any walnuts left but I did have plenty of pinon nuts. Well I followed the recipe but added the pinon nuts. Another thing I did was I left out the rasins and used red seedless grapes instead of the green. Come the end of the turkey dinner and we barely had any salad left for the next day. Thanks for a good recipe...this one is a keeper. Everyone liked it especially the kids.",
