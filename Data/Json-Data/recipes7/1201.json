It's cherry season in Washington State so I used 1 pound of fresh Bing cherries halved & pitted them then tossed with a couple tablespoons of sugar and let sit a few hours prior to making the recipe. This made enough cherry juice to make the sauce later on. I also opted to bake the chicken in olive oil instead of pan-frying (I left out the flour when baking). When I was done making the sauce I just poured it over the chicken in the baking pan and returned to the oven for 10 minutes. It was absolutely delicious!",

I scraped it off and kept going though and the end result was sensational. The sauce was delicious; sweet tangy and thick.
