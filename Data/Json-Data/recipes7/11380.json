I didn't even let it sit for 24 hrs though I just dove in right away and wow was it good! I can only imagine what tomorrow will bring! The pickles aren't overpowering or obvious but add a nice saltiness that will make people ask what you put in your salsa. This makes 6 very large servings. I ended up using half of it to make Tim's Turkey Tortilla Soup from this site. Delish! I cheated and bought pre-diced pickles (Mt. Olive Dill Relish - NOT sweet relish) just because I was feeling lazy. Next time I'm going to experiment with Vlasic Bold & Spicy Chipotle pickles. Great recipe duboo!:)",

I made it yesterday for a get together today with two small tweaks: no black pepper (because I loathe it) and diced tomatoes in lieu of crushed for a bit more texture and one bigger tweak: dried parsley in place of cilantro. It was a hit! Our guests really liked it (even a self proclaimed \"pickle hater\") as did we. It was easy to make and uses pantry staples so I can definitely see this being a party staple at the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe Duboo!",

( i only had a jar of sliced jalapeno so i used about 4 or 5 slices of that). i then tasted and found it to be \"hot\" enough so omitted the red pepper flakes. i also omitted the pickle juice as there was plenty of liquid in it at that point. very good. very fresh tasting. i would definitely make again!",
