I made it the second time creaming the sugar and butter/marg first, then adding one egg at a time and mixing well between eggs,  then adding the mango pulp with  one mashed mango and a few dashes of cinnamon (because I had a mango on hand) added to pulp to equal  1 and 3/4 cup and adding the flour ingredients (sifted well together)  last until just combined which is normally how a cake or loaf is done and found it to be far superior than the first instruction on this site.  Now it has a four star rating and with cinnamon whipped cream (ice cream or frozen yogurt) it was five stars.  I also want to try this again with a mango sauce of some sort to enhance the mango flavor and a bit of almond flavoring in batter to enhance the almonds on top.",

(3 mangos 2 TB powered sugar 1/4 cup milk - put all in blender until smooth). The sauce was incredible. Before serving we poured the leftover sauce over the cake. The cake did go to an all new level of taste appeal.",
