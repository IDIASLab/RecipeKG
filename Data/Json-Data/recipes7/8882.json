And this native New Yorker can tell you, this is hands-down the best lo mein I ever put in my mouth! The only changes I made are very minor. No red bell pepper because I'm allergic, and used pork, chicken, and shrimp in place of only pork (making this my own version of \"house lo mein\".) The flavor lingers pleasantly on the palate, and the sauce enrobes the linguine gently with no trace of gloopiness. Just the right hint of sweetness, not overpowering as so many are. It really doesn't  matter what protein you use. The sauce is a symphony of taste, which elevates anything you choose to feature. In my case, said choice was dictated by what was in my fridge. For the pork, I diced up 2 small boneless chops. Loved the liberal use of mushrooms. Bamboo shoots and/or water chestnuts could be successfully added, as well. This recipe needs no tinkering, however, to ensure a virtuosic blend of flavors. Phenomenal!",

I added more ginger, but that's just a personal taste preference.   We were longing for just a little spiciness, so we ended up adding a sprinkle of red pepper flakes at the dinner table which brought it up to speed for us.  Pork was tender and juicy, vegetables were crisp, and the sauce was loaded with flavor.  Thanks, Kendra, for sharing your recipe.",

Stir fried the pork and some of the onion first, then set aside, then stir fried the veggies. Combined all in the dutch oven used to cook the linguine to save a mess.\n\nFinally, sugar snap peas were so expensive in the store, I went with 16 oz frozen Asian veggies, and fresh mushrooms and a red bell pepper.\n\nThis is a definite keeper. I cannot wait till more find it! It is so worthy of many, many likes. Thanks Kendra\n\nHarry in Escondido CA",
