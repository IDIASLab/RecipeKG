I took the pie out after the suggested cooking time and realized it needed a little more time. I changed the temperature to 500 degrees and left the pie in for five more minutes - it came out perfect. If you re a chocolate lover you will LOVE this pie! It s rich and decadent with pecan-y goodness. I suggest pairing it with ice cream since it s so rich.",
