Still used the 2/3 cups sugar, maybe a little more because of the extra tartness, and I didn't have plain orange juice so I used one of my kids fruit & veggie raspberry orange drinking boxes. It tasted AMAZING and snuck a few more nutrients in there too! I also blended mine after it was cooked and cooled because we like a smoother sauce. In my opinion the juice and the vanilla make this sauce as good as it is! Don't use those recipes that are just fruit and sugar. AWESOME recipe!!",
