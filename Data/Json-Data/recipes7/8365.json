As I also use eggs in the batter that along with the milk instead of baking powder I use just baking soda. I mix the flours together with whatever spices and then add the clambered milk. I let set covered in a warm place at least a hour. Then I add the soda and eggs. I use right away. I use the same method to make herb and or pepper n cheese pan cakes/breads.",

I even pre-measured the dry ingredients into 2 cup batches in baggies as an additional time saver, so all I had to do was dump it all into a bowl and add the wet ingredients. Flavor was not an issue; no left overs here! These are a cake type of pancake, so if you like a flatter-type of pancake, you can certainly add a little more water, but be careful not to add too much. I measured my pancakes using a1/4 cup measure and got 12 5-inch pancakes. I am thinking that these would make a nice 'Pancakes in a Jar' type of gift, too. Thanks so much for this recipe. I truly dislike that boxed stuff with mystery ingredients no one can pronounce. I would give you more stars if I could.",

The taste is definitely better than the boxed mix!!! We added some bananas to it and it still cooked evenly and came out excellent. Just as if you were preparing the boxed kind, if you find your homemade mix to be to thin once you've added the wet ingredients, simply add a little more of your dry mix to thicken it up!!! If its too thick, add a tiny bit more water until you have your desired consistency! But once again, very easy & FAST to make, tasty and the consistency was nice, not too dense you know? I LOVE great tasting recipes that involve using things one normally has on hand!! Like some of the other Allrecipes.com members wrote in their comments, I too will NEVER buy boxed mix again... Just great, thanks!!!",
