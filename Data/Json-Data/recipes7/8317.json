I love serving this with a spring mix salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. Instead of scallopini, you can use veal cutlets and sometimes beef cutlets. The beef cutlets would take another 10 minutes longer cooking with the sauce.",

I added some oregano to the bread crumbs and skipped dipping the cutlets in egg.  I simply pressed them into the crumb mixture.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used some homemade marinara, but still added it to the sauteed peppers and onion.  The red pepper just gives this such a delightful flavor, my son says he  could drink the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

Since I didn't have stewed tomatoes I used fresh cubed tomato and saut\u00e9ed it with the onion & bell pepper. Then I added a bit of red wine and 2 tbsps of tomato paste. I paired it with KitchenAid mashed potatoes pouring melted butter & warm milk slowly while the machine's working. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.",
