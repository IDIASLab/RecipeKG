I ended up spooning off the oil that was layered/separated on the top. After I took the photo I put the sauce into my mini blender (more dirty dishes) because we didn t care for the minced garlic (maybe just our personal preference for a \"smooth\" sauce). Finally the cornstarch-water addition at the end just didn t make sense to me because the sauce already was plenty thick...I didn t add it. The spiciness level was spot on and the taste was OK but I doubt I ll be using this again for chicken wings.",
