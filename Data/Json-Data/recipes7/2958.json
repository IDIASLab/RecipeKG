I absolutely loved this-a couple of minor adaptions- I chopped up the chipolte peppers instead of pureeing them and baked them on a hot cookie sheet that was placed in the oven as it preheated. It's also a very beautiful looking bread. I like the addition of cheese cubes (as opposed to shredded) because it made swirls of cheese. Used a kitchenaid stand mixer for the mixing and kneading - and it was pretty easy.",

Made it in the kitchen aide with the dough hook for the most part although I had to pull it out to knead in some of the flour that would not incorporate. It is a MESSY dough but so worth it. Baked to an internal temp of 190 degrees. Covered with foil after ten minutes to prevent over-browning. Even though my friends know I love to bake everyone at my church community group thought I had purchased this at a bakery. It looked and tasted amazing although you might leave out the seeds if you don't like REALLY spicy bread.",
