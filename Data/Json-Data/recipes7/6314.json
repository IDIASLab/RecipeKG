We both couldn't get over how flavorful and how well the fish was cooked for cooking so long. I think cutting it in bite sized pieces helped cook evenly and the mushroom sauce on top was thick and so kept the fish from burning. Was also surprised that halibut is so costly right now. We'll save it for special friends and splurges for ourselves. Great recipe.",

If I were to change anything up next time I'll use a nice tuna steak and use only the broiler so it turns out nice and rare. I get intimidated cooking fish when I can't see it cuz I don't want to overcook it. Since the fish was buried in this delicious mushroom mixture I had to go digging to watch the cooking progress. With tuna rare is better which takes off some pressure there. Thanks for the great recipe! (If by chance the tuna doesn't pan out well I'll go back to your method!)",
