It needs a solid layer to counteract the chocolate. Back off the cocoa powder just a bit. It's very overpowering to the taste. Add a half tsp of salt to the cookie dough to bring out the flavor. Chill the cookie itself in the fridge after it's been thoroughly cooled. It'll keep the soft texture and allow the cheesecake layer to solidfy in texture and taste. It really improved the as-is cookie a ton. Solid recipe. I'll be making this again.",

It really made the filling set and added something to the cookie so I'd recommend trying it with at least half your batch so you can see the difference for yourself. Will definitely make again!!!

The cheesecake filling didn't really add any cheesecakey flavor though. I tasted both components before baking and the filling was pretty cheesecakey. It lost something in the baking and was more of an icing on the finished product. It didn't take away from the cookie but it really didn't add \"cheesecake\" to it either. Overall I give this 3.5 stars because it should have been much more of a cheesecake flavor if it's going to be called a cheesecake cookie. Still a good cookie though.",
