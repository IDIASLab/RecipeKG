I'm glad I did! This was very good! I have to admit, though I LOVE sesame oil, 1/2 cup seemed a bit much, so I started off with 1/4 cup and thought I would just add more if I needed to. I didn't. I thought that that was the perfect amount for us. Also, I used thin spaghetti because hubby doesn't like angel hair and I added more green onions than called for. I served this warm, but can't wait to try the leftovers cold tomorrow. We really enjoyed the spiciness from the chili oil as well. I will be using this recipe again, for sure!

                "reviewBody": "Love the flavors in the salad! I scaled this recipe back a bit since I am only serving two people. I left out the hot chili oil because family members don't tolerate spiciness well. I used the angel hair pasta, boiled for 4 minutes then drained it and set it aside. I added 3T sesame oil, 4T soysauce, 2T balsamic vinegar but keeping almost the 1/4 cup of the white sugar called for in the recipe. I tased the sauce until it was the right balance with sweetness. I added the warm noodles into the sauce along with the chopped green onions and red bell peppers. I added more chopped green onions and a little yellow and orange bell peppers for color, texture and nutrition. At first the sauce will seem like a lot, however the warm noodles will soak it all up. I highly suggest chilling the noodles to allow the flavors to meld and come alive. Right before serving I sprinkled sesame seeds over the noodles for added presentation (see my picture in the photo gallery). A very colorful dish with peppers, green onions and sesame seeds. This salad is simply easy to prepare and flavorful. The balsamic vinegar is an interesting twist but it was not strong with all other ingredients. I always like the combination of the sesame oil with soy sauce and sugar. The sauce can easily be adjusted to fit your tastes. I served these noodles along with, \"Hoisin-Ginger Beef Skewers,\" from this website and another tasty dish! The sesame noodle is best served chilled especially on a hot, humid day!",

The fundamental revision I make to the recipe is to sub 1/2 of the sesame oil with vegetable or canola oil - so 1/4 cup each sesame and vegetable oil - otherwise the sesame flavor is too overpowering for my taste.  From there I like to add crushed peanuts, shredded carrots, lots of fresh cilantro and a little fresh lime juice to make it more Thai inspired....it's all up to you and your tastes!  I've even added ground chicken and pork to make this a main dish and it's delicious.",

I was skeptical about the balsamic vinegar, as most Asian pasta recipes call for rice vinegar. I'm going to try this recipe with rice vinegar next time I make it solely for comparison purposes, but just know that it is delicious as is. The hot chili oil gives it just the right amount of kick. I usually order a spiciness of \"3\" out of a range of 1-5 in Thai restaurants. So if you like mild or extra spicy, you might want to adjust the hot chili oil accordingly. Also, I used linguine noodles, just because that is our preference. Finally, make sure you read the label when purchasing sesame oil. I grabbed a sesame oil \"blend,\" only to discover after reading the label that it had other oils mixed in with it. I put it back on the shelf and grabbed the bottle labeled \"pure\" sesame oil, and reading the label confirmed for me that the oil was indeed 100% sesame oil, and not a blend. This is very good!",

I followed the sauce recipe exactly as written with no substitutions. It is very good cold so it can be made a day ahead, this lets the flavors blend as well.  I'd recommend adding the sesame seeds just before serving, it adds a little crunch to the texture. We also increased the amount of sesame seeds after we tasted it. One tip - buy the toasted sesame seeds in an Asian market or the Asian section of the grocery store.  Much cheaper than in the spice section. The response? - Three people at the party requested the recipe - so go for it!",

I also missed the flavors of ginger and garlic which some other sesame noodle recipes I like have in them. Sure you can play with the recipe and try to improve it but as it is written I found it too sweet.",
