Followed the recipe but did add more cumin and some Roasted hatch chile seasoning I had on hand (just personal taste preference). I think this also could be served chilled like a gazpacho (we'll see tomorrow!). Tomato soup always was my childhood favorite and then as an adult I grew to appreciate roasted pepper soup. Now I can combine both and this is the BEST of both!",

I loved it with the lime and avocado and I will use the cotija next time. The only thing that could have made it better would be to share it with the submitter! Thanks for posting.",
