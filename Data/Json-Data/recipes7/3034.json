The end result was a very THIN and runny sauce (not like any sauce I have seen before). In order to make it more like my family likes it I added one 6oz. can of tomato paste. The green chili's give it a very subtle heat. I served this sauce over the Maria's Stuffed Chicken Breasts recipe. Overall it was a good tasting sauce.",

I dont like my sauce as thin as this recipe is so I only added about 2 cups of water and simmered a lot longer about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I did have to season this very well with italian seasonings and dried basil. When putting in fresh basil at the beginning it pretty much mellows out the flavor and is better to add close to the end to get the full basil flavor. I chunked up some yellow squash and added it in as well. The sauce came out nice and robust from all the vegies and simmering longer. It didnt seem to coat the spaghetti as well as other pasta sauces do and it made a big batch! So we had plenty of leftover sauce. Thanks for the recipe! I may make again sometime because I really liked the addition of all the vegies in it.",

I made a couple of small changes; I used crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce (to make it just a bit chunkier) omitted the green pepper (because I'm the only one in my family of 4 who likes it) and added an extra can of Italian style diced tomatoes instead of the water because I didn't want the sauce to be too thin. It turned out fabulous! This is the 3rd time I'm making it this month!!!
