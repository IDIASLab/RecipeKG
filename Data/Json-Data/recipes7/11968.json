I used more sugar twice the amount as it wasn't sweet enough for me.... also I added chocolate to the cream cheese (to make it look like the photos) by taking 3 tbsp of cocoa powder and 1tbsp of oil (mix together - you make a melted semi sweet chocolate) that you can add to cream cheese - while mixing and make a yummy chocolate version...... Spoon it all over the cake in pan. I used spatula I had in hand to swirl it thru batter making cool texture..... smelled delicious baking. It is yummy....super fast clean up. I will make it again.....",
