I didn't want a flop, so I made a couple of changes. First of all, the amount of flour seemed rather high...I looked at other bundt and pound cake recipes that had similar quantities of butter, eggs, and sugar, and it seemed that they used no more than about 3 cups of flour, not 4 3/4 cups. So I cut the amount of flour down to 3 cups, and am glad I did, because the batter was really stiff with just that amount; I can't imagine what it would have been like if I used 4 3/4 cups. I also change the method of incorporating the sugar and butter...I've never made a cake (pound or otherwise) that had the ingredients cooked together on the stove. I creamed the butter and sugar together instead, and then beat in the eggs and vanilla a proceeded with the recipe that way. I also baked it in a Bundt pan instead of a square pan...it filled the pan nicely, and would have certainly gone over the edge and burned on the bottom of the oven had I made it in a square pan. The finished cake, with these changes, was very good. It had a pound cake-like texture, and the lemon flavor was excellent. I'm sorry if I offend anyone by making these changes, but I didn't want to risk all the wasted time and ingredients that would have been the case otherwise. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I creamed the butter and sugar because that is what makes the tiny air pockets inside the cake which make it rise. No amount of leavening can make up for this step. I also added the milk before I started adding the flour. By the time I had added 3 1/2 cups of flour I had a batter that was almost too stiff and obviously not going to fit in a 9 x 9 pan so I used a loaf pan and baked it at 325 for just under an hour. I am wondering if way back when oil may have been used instead of butter? I actually would have given it 3 1/2 stars because the flavor is lovely.",
