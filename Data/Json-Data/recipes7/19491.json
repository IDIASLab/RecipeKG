So my monkey bread was noticeably lacking in sweetness, but nevertheless, it was great!",

I added a 3.5oz pack of cook and serve butterscotch putting (not instant). I also added about a 1/2 cup of pecans to the bottom of the bunt pan. I followed the directions the rest of the way, except I mixed the remaining butter and sugar mixture together and poured over the top of the pan. I have to say, the dough turned out great and I think the pudding mix gave it that extra oomph without making it too sweet. I've made this in the past before, without the pudding and it wasn't as good to us. I'd give it 5 stars with the added alterations, but only 4 stars with the recipe as is. It's a great base recipe!",
