It was a crowd pleaser at our Thanksgiving table and is going to be a recipe I make frequently throughout the year as well. I used English cukes which have no seeds. I did peel them but I am sure that is not needed. I replaced the onion with shallots and having no white pepper just used black. Only a purist would tell and then it would be difficult due to the dill. I made it the day before so it had ample time for the flavors to marry. Excellent salad and one you should try soon. This was just one of four five star dishes on our Thanksgiving table this year. Thank you Allrecipes.com and all those who contribute. I am a devoted fan.",
