I followed the recipe except used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 bread flour and added about 1/4 C of whole milk to the dough.  Everyone's starter is going to vary in moisture content, so you may need to tweak this part and add more liquid to the dough to make it come together.  Before baking I brushed with milk and sprinkled heavily with raw sugar (demerara).  I think any kind of sugar would add a pleasantly crunchy top.  I also baked them at night and re-warmed them in a toaster oven for breakfast.  Love that spice!  We had jam but ended up eating them plain as they were sooo good as is.",

The positive reviews encouraged me as there are quite a few sourdough recipes of various yummy things out there! What I liked about the recipe is that the ingredients are simple so most of the time you already have the ingredients in the pantry (and its a basic recipe so you can change your additions each time with confidence. I changed the number of servings to eight and they still came out lovely! It is a easy, quick and delicious way to use the excess starter. I left out the spice and instead added fresh dates broken up into pieces which gave a lovely flavour and blended nicely into the scone. My dough was a little dry so I added some kefir milk and brushed the top of the scone with kefir milk (didnt add the sugar). They rose beautifully, browned nicely and even formed a little crust and cracking as bread would on the surface. Light, fluffy with a lovely flavour! Moist enough and flavourful enough to grab one the go, not needing any filling or even butter! Great, reliable recipe! :-)",

I have been looking for sourdough recipes since I developed my own starter (equal parts flour and water, fed daily for 5 days then refrigerated and fed weekly).  I used baking powder instead of cream of tartar, and I used coarse sea salt in place of regular salt.  I topped with milk as suggested and added brown rock sugar.  The taste is incredible!  Even my husband ate them, and he is very picky about baked goods.  This is a great way to use my sourdough starter, thanks!",
