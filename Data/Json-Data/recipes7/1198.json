But my hubby absolutely loves the stuff so I decided to make it for him. First of all it came out nice and thick but not too thick even though I forgot to put in the butter salt and pepper at the end. Quite frankly it didn't need it. Second of all because I love my hubby I agreed to try it. You know it's actually pretty good. My hubby went wild over it. The only other thing I did different (aside from forgetting the butter and salt and pepper that is) was I used the beet juice like others here recommended. I'll make it again for sure....AND maybe even eat some myself. A keeper!",
