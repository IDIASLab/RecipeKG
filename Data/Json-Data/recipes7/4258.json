I reduced the heat on the boil - just barely kept it boiling but not boiling too hard - and did the full hour.  I really didn't lose that much liquid.  My cider wasn't too sweet at all, but we felt it needed a pinch of salt and more spices, so I added those at the end.  After straining, I got 2.5 liters of cider, so definitely not a full gallon.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used the pulpy apples that were left to make the best darn apple butter I've ever had: added 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup white sugar, a tsp of salt, ground cloves, nutmeg and more cinnamon and cooked with a lid for three hours and without a lid for another hour and a half.  I used an immersion blender to blend in the apple skins and got four cups yield.  YUM all around - happy with the cider and the apple butter, too!",

My picky 12 year old even drank a cup and said she would drink it again.  I will say that something must've went wrong because I only got about a quart of cider when it was all said and done.  I think boiling it for an hour was too much and broke it down too fast and then after that it started evaporating.  I will for sure make it again, but will put less heat on at first and not boil it uncovered that long.  I will make more within the next couple of days and let you know how that goes.-----ok I made it again, I added more water (won't do again) it was ok just watered down, so if I happen to do it again, I will do exactly as stated but will just shorten the boiling time and end up with only a quart of cider, but very yummy...",

I'm hardly an apple cider aficionado (and had to look up the difference between \"juice\" and \"cider\"), but this tasted really good, and the bottle of store-brand cider in my fridge couldn't compare. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It didn't say what kind of apples to use, but I did a tiny bit of research and decided to mix 5 Cameos and 5 Granny Smiths. I also presumed I didn't need to bother removing the stems, cores or seeds; I just quartered the apples and tossed them into my stockpot. This also marked only the second time I'd ever used cheesecloth. I was a bit careful with the two sieving steps, but overall the recipe is quite easy, even though it stretches out over 3 hours, plus more time to chill. I've already told people about how easy and tasty this is, and I plan to make another batch this coming weekend. Thanks for opening up a new dimension for this intermediate cook, and such a delicious taste too!",

While I would say make this when you're going to be around the house all day just so you can keep an eye on it it is certainly NOT time consuming.
