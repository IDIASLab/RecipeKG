I had only red grapes and sliced them in half and it worked really well. Topped the dessert dishes with toasted almonds instead of brown sugar only because I had no brown sugar and 8 yo grandson suggested the nuts. I made this shortly after lunch to serve as dessert for dinner and left it in fridge for about 6 hours. Tart and sweet and crunchy. Colorful and delicious! Thank you for sharing!!",

Particularly liked the cream cheese layer and I think its flavor would marry equally well with fresh strawberries and cherries. The brown sugar sprinkle bleeds into the cream cheese topping pretty quickly so if you want even nicer presentation chill and then add that last. Simple preparation and nice to have another option for a grape dessert other than a nice fresh fruit salad.",
