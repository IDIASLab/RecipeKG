I do this on a regular basis, then bake my loaves in the oven. Just this once, I'd planned to bake the bread in the machine, but didn't notice the part about putting it in the oven until I'd already started adding the ingredients to the pan. Being a \"bread machine\" recipe, I chose to add the ingredients to the pan as I always do. I followed the ingredients for the most part. I didn't have powdered milk, so I used skim milk in place of water. I also added 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten to the flour. When the dough was done rising, I realized very quickly it was too much for one bread pan. (Other reviewers have mentioned this as well.) I divided it into two parts and placed each in a 9x5 bread pan. I dampened the top of each loaf and sprinkled on some oats before covering the loaves. After the one-hour rise, the loaves were both well above the tops of the pans. The bread was done baking in 25 minutes and was nice and light, not at all dense. The loaves did sink a little as they cooled. As stated, the bread is very good, but the directions are definitely off. I'm wondering if this is a misprint by the editors or intentional.",

It flowed way over the sides making the loaf really wide. I followed the recipe as written and the loaf also squished when cutting the slices making the already wide loaf flattened to boot. I may try again cutting the sugar back to 1 tsp. and dividing the bread into two loaves.",
