I added a little extra honey to compensate -- which was completely unnecessary. I chose not to use coconut because it seemed too dry & am happy with that decision. I substituted pumpkin pie spice for nutmeg & it was pleanty good. I probobly heaped my spice spoons. The other really interesting thing is the walnuts. I grated them in a food processer instead of chopping them. They ended up powdery with the occasional crunchy bit & the nutty taste was mixed in all the bread. I was really happy with this.",
