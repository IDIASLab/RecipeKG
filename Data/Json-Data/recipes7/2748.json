I didn't use the almonds or the almond flavoring prefering a simple teaspoon of vanilla so as to get the pure buttery flavor of the cake. The cake is moist and delicious but I found that the pears didn't contribute much in the way of flavor so that when I came across a blueberry I found I wanted more of them. Therefore if I was to make this again unless there's some real flavorful pear I'm unaware of I'd skip the pears altogether. I'd maybe substitute apples with the blueberries instead or maybe just use blueberries but a lot more of them.",

I loved them together with the pieces of almonds. I increased the blueberries to 1 cup of frozen and liked them in the cake more for color contrast and health benefits. I did NOT add the cinnamon sugar topping and am glad I didn t. I was quite sweet enough without it for me. I prefer a mildly sweet coffee cake. Ate with a dollop of real whipped cream but then liked it better alone. My hubby who doesn t eat fruit liked it and said it made him feel like he was eating healthy lol! Will probably be a regular at our house. Will try using white whole wheat flour next time. --- After making it a 2nd time: Either ripe or unripe pears are fine - however if pears ripe and sweet then reduce sugar! Cake was a bit too sweet the second time maybe because of ripe sweet pears. Tart blueberries make a nice contrast to sweet pears and sugar in cake. Test cake for done-ness at the very center. Mine was a little raw in the center and had to go back for 15 more min. White whole wheat flour works just as well as white. I used 3 pears and 1 cup of blueberries and 1/2 cup of almonds - this is a very moist fruitful cake;) Almost like eating pie with the crust mixed in.",
