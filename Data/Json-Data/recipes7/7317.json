It was excellent, with a perfect texture and just the right sweetness.  It took right about 1 hour in my oven, though I never got a \"clean\" toothpick out of the center since it was always covered with blueberry juice.  Perfect!  Thanks so much.",

Next time instead of 1/2 c of butter (one stick) I will use about 3/4 stick to see how it turns out. Some of the butter was remaining in the dish and didn't get absorbed into the cobbler so that tells me it doesn't need that much. I used about 5-6 cups of berries too to use them up and it turned out just fine. I am sure you could use any kind of berries and it would be great - or a variety of them at once!",

BUT ... this is something that is eaten on rare occasions (at least I would) ... but I must say ... this is a w o n d e r f u l recipe ... and I give it five stars ... but only for guests or on occasion.  As I stated previously, I used blueberries, one apple and a couple handfuls of raisins (soaked in rum) ... I didn't have enough blueberries ... it turned out SO FAB I CAN'T TELL YOU.  Next time I will try peaches or apricots or whatever is handy and in season at the time ... juicy fruits are better.  Yum recipe to be used over and over and over again because of its easiness and its versatility and it's yummyness.  I totally recommend trying this recipe as stated with a changeover in fruits if you like.  I won't cut down on the butter ... but I won't make it often with this amount of butter.  I used a soufflet type dish ... one of those round white sizeable ones.  GO FOR IT!!!",

So I added about 4 tsp more sugar because some were a little unripe. I also added 2 tsp of flour so help absorb any excess liquids. I didn't have self rising flour so I followed the 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt directions someone else suggested. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon and .5 tsp nutmeg. I baked it convection as well. However it still took me 60 min to bake it. I think it was due to the excess moisture from the fresh berries and washing them. I feel like it could have used more sugar, but otherwise it was pretty good.",

I would consider myself a moderately good baker, and this really leaves something to be desired. First of all, it uses WAY too much butter, and I love butter. I cut the butter amount to 5 TB, and that was still plenty, if not too much. It definately needed vanilla, so I added some of that. The texture was just off, not like a cobbler. It was overly sticky and greasy, which I think affected the overall texture. I really can't put my finger on it. It wasn't bad, just not what I was going for. Overall, I may need to keep searching for a good cobbler recipe! This just wasn't it for me.",
