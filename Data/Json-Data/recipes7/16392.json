Everything for a wonderful meal is in this recipe...I followed it to a tee but did do a little changes...I always do this with every recipe. 1) I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts - more moisture in my opinion and less likely to overcook and be dry; 2) made twice the amount of dressing and with the first batch, marinated the chicken in the refrigerator for 2 hours - second batch I added the sugar and used for the cucumber/tomato salad; 3) used crushed dried rosemary in the first batch and fresh chopped rosemary in the second batch; added freshly ground pepper to both batches.
