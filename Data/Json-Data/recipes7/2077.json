Still this recipe was a great place to start! Because of the 3 tablespoons of oil (in this case \"oven-fried\" is not a euphemism for \"baked\") the coating comes out nice and crispy. We really liked it. I did end up cooking for a few extra minutes but my oven was evidently built on Mars and I've learned never to trust it. Thanks for the recipe we'll make this again!",
