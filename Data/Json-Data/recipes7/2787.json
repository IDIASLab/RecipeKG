I'm not sure why it would be soupy perhaps the caramel never candied? Make sure you cook the caramel mixture long enough before adding it to the apples so possibly longer than 12 minutes. We have a very hot gas stove. Also we used VERY large apples so many more apples would be necessary. I really hope it turns out well for you; we absolutly love this dish and are also making it for Thanksgiving:)",
