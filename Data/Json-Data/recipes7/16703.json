        "description": "I came up with this 'eat clean' healthy green bean casserole recipe for the Thanksgiving feature article of Natural Health magazine using Dr. Oz's 10 super foods. The super food in this dish is pumpkin seeds. As for green bean casserole, although it's always been a hit in our family, I realize there are two types of people; those who love green bean casserole, and those who don't. As for me, even before I became enthused with eating and cooking healthfully I was never a particularly enthusiastic fan of mushroom soup dumped on top of green beans. Garnish with whole pumpkin seeds.",
