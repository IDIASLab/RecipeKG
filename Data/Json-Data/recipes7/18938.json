I used a tablespoon spring scoop to make my cookie balls (one whole and a half scoop per cookie) and put them right on the baking sheet in the shape of a ball. I baked the cookies for exactly 12 minutes until they turned light brown, let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then moved them to the cooling rack. They were puffy at first then deflated slightly. They turned out perfect and chewy with the crunch of the pecans. Toasting the coconut and pecans was the key to this recipe, it really brought out the flavor for sure! I used unsalted butter and did not add any salt to my recipe and they were fine. Very nice!!!!!!!!!!",
