I think if I were to make any changes they would be to salt the squash before stuffing and to add a bit of sage to the stuffing as well as to replace the stock with white wine (pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc). Seriously it is great the way it is. My wife is looking forward to the next time I make this.",

I increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup put a lid on the skillet and cooked it for 40 minutes. I had leftover rotisserie chicken which I tore into pieces and added turning the oven to warm until heated through. Great one pot meal. My hubby loved it. Will definitely make this again.",
