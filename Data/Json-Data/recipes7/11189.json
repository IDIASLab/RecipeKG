I followed the recipe closely but I chose to put in only 1/2 cup of onion because I don't care for the taste of raw onions. This reminds me of Three-Bean Salad and the dressing basically tasted like the liquid from sweet pickles. I boosted the Southwestern flavor by adding some cumin and some chili powder to taste. Not sure I'll make this again since the canned ingredients listed are not usually on my pantry shelf. Thanks for posting.",
