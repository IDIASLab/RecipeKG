It is a great way to bring in the fall season because it is packed full of vegetables, pork, and butternut squash. It is perfect paired with cornbread muffins and a great way to use leftover pork roast or pulled pork barbeque! White potatoes can be substituted for the butternut squash.",

I guess it could be most likened to Pork BBQ soup tasting like BBQ pork smothered in BBQ sauce and baked beans. The butternut squash softened up like a substitute potato to add some thickness. The flavor the other ingredients could have provided were completely drowned out by the baked beans and BBQ sauce. It's just not a flavor you're expecting in soup. This recipe makes a LOT. My large crockpot was overflowing. I'll be freezing a bunch for an emergency meal but we won't be making this again.",
