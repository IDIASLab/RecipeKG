As a result I had to sub 2 c flour and 1 cup coconut flour. Reduced to 1/4 cup sour cream and added extra 100 g milk. Also sub butter with 1/4 oil. I added the lemon juice after the mixing to prevent the milk from curdling. I also use half sugar and half splenda. So overall I can\u2019t really say i made this recipe....more like \u201cinspired\u201d. XD The issue I have with this recipe is that it is really for 12 jumbo muffin pans and not cupcake size muffin. I ended up with extra batter and I bake them in a mini cake pan.\n\nAlso the liquid instructions could be much better. Mix egg first, then butter, then sour cream. After that add sugar, then finally milk. That way you won\u2019t get all these lumps. Before you mix in the dry ingredients.\n\nEverything else is great!",
