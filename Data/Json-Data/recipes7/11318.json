My second son ate it but it was a tad overcooked. Round 2 I added some vanilla and cooked on high for 2 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. A son 1 tried it and said it was weird with chief complaints about texture. He kept saying it was eggy but when asked said it didn't taste like eggs. I made a couple more for my husband and 3rd son to get their opinion. My youngest son did not like it at all. He only had a couple bites. My husband agreed with my oldest that although it tasted ok it had texture issues and was unlike other in a mug treats I have made him... he wasn't a fan of this one. I think adjusting the egg and using the yolk only may help but adjustments are needed to make this 4 or 5 stars.",

Omit the egg and add a tablespoon of whole milk and a pinch (1/16th tsp) of baking powder. Use 1/4 cup of flour. Use a generous pinch of salt - too little salt and you won't taste the peanut butter as much. I also sprinkle some organic sugar on top before cooking, which adds a pleasant crunch to the top when it's done. Cooking time depends on your microwave power. At 1200 watts it's done in about 30-45 seconds. Err on the side of underdone.",

Although, I did happen to look through the comments and found that instead of using a whole egg, I should use only 1 egg white and add a dash of baking soda. So I did; but only cooked it for 90 seconds. And it tastes great! Afterwords, I ask tested a bit of chocolate syrup and it added to the flavor. I highly suggest adding these changes!",
