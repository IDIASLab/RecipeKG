I scaled this back to two servings (would be 3 servings in this house) which called for 2 Tbsp sugar.  I used only one, but whoa, it still was too sweet for us.  Would recommend that  you start with less sugar, and add more if it suits your taste.  I also did add salt and pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I like all of these ingredients individually, but liked them even better combined.  Good, old tasty comfort food!",

It was just too sweet.\" We love the way cabbage absorbs the delicious slippery-ness of sausage grease, but between the butter, sausage, and the sugar, this was just too TOO much. Paprika was also such a dominant spice that if I made this again, I'd drastically reduce the sugar along with the paprika. The recipe also didn't say anything other than cooking the potatoes for 8 min. in the microwave - covered? uncovered? stir half-way through? The pre-cooking of the potatoes added simplicity to the timing of the recipe but for somebody who doesn't usually microwave spuds, I could've used some direction.",
