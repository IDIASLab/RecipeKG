This muffin is the best of savory and sweet, the raisn-caraway seed combo is a winner, it\u2019s tender, and the texture is just firm enough, but not dense.  And OMG, are they quick and easy to make.  joaniecny, thanks for a delicious new muffin recipe!  ****UPDATE 5.23.18:  I make this recipe often and keep these muffins in the freezer.  In an effort to lighten, today I sub'd Egg Beaters\u00ae for the egg, Truvia\u00ae Bakiing Blend for the sugar, and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\u00ae Organic Spread for the butter.  They baked up beautifully, and are delish!",

                "reviewBody": "This  recipe rates a 5 for ease of preparation.  It's sweeter and closer to a muffin texture than Irish Soda Bread.   To avoid over mixing the dough, I had the egg and buttermilk at room temperature and wisked the melted butter into the liquids before adding to flour mixture.  If making 12 muffins you'll have to mound the dough in the muffin cups and bake for 20 minutes.  I made 18 normal sized muffins and they tested done at 15 minutes.  Is also a great base recipe for substitutions by swapping out the caraway seeds and raisins for other dried fruits and nuts.",

My actual qualm with it is that the batter sticks to the muffin paper cups. If I make this again, I would use baking spray on the tin. Now, my recipe yielded 15 cupcake sized servings. Muffin tins are slightly bigger therefore the original recipe will yield 12.  If you use cupcake tins, you will get 15. I might try using demerara sugar next time and additional melted butter as suggested for a golden top. However, the 30 minute baking time yielded nice golden tops in my cupcakes.",
