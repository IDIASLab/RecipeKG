In the future, I may substitute some of the water with vegetable stock, but other than that, wouldn\u2019t change a thing.   I also will make this in my Instant Pot\u00ae next time to reduce the cooking time and no presoaking beans.  Thanks for sharing your grandmother\u2019s recipe, it\u2019s a good one.",
