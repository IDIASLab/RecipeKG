Because it's whipped over a bain-marie, it doesn't need to be baked - which makes it especially great for my favorite lemon icebox pie (I suggest trying that if you're into lemon meringue pie!). Precision is important, otherwise it's as foolproof as the title says. Hope you love it as much as I do.",

Mine was still a little grainy when using granulated sugar. I may try powdered next time and see how it turns out. Kids liked it but they were asking for a pinch of vanilla. We'll see next time. Thanks for the easy and quick recipe. Update: Spending the night in the refrigerator it ended up more the consistency of marshmallow. Not sure what I did wrong but still tasty.",
