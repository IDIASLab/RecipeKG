Don't cut down on the time simmered and baked, because as the water evaporates the flavor only becomes more robust. \nModifications I made: \n- Mash Potatoes in place of crust. More like a Shepherd's Pie. It's also cheaper. About 3lbs of yellow potatoes, boiled then mashed. 4 Tbshp of unsalted butter, 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. Salt and Pepper to taste. (I don't use a blender for potatoes because it changes the dynamic of the mash) Chunks are good. \n-Doubled the recipe because I had a feeling this would be a hit and for all the time you put in it, you might as well have plenty of leftovers. \n- 2lbs of chuckeye with all the fat removed which probably made it about 1 1/2lbs of meat. \n- Used one white onion, then 2 shallots.\n- added about a 1lb of fresh cut up green beans. \n- Baby Portabella Mushrooms in place of crimini     and I added a little more than what it called for.\n- Didn't add the sugar \n- subbed bay leaf for sage. \n- I also think you could add caraway seed or fennel seed, but didn't want to mess more than I did.",

As other people have mentioned as well as making this as a pie i often just eat it as a stew or casserole- it works brilliantly both ways! It does take a while to cook i guess but the rich flavour you get at the end of it is so worth it!",
