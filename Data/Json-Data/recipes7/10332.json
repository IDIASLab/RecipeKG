The batter is quite liquid but the cookies hold their shape on the cookie sheet. Cooking times and instructions were right on. I made them gluten free using the Brown Rice Flour Blend from AR and needed no gums or extra binders. The pumpkin and butterscotch flavours mingle well together. Thanks for the recipe Gio_Bowers.",

I did use Swerve to curb the sugar, but have no fear: still deliciously divine!!",

I slightly modified it because I had 1 1/2 cups of leftover pumpkin pur\u00e9e from my pumpkin pie. Therefore the changes I've made was to decrease the amount of oil to 1/3. Because I wasn't paying attention I baked the cookies in a 350\u00baF preheated oven instead of 325\u00baF and I also let them cook longer for a couple minutes (I was distracted...lol). After those two mistakes they still came out amazing and yummy! This recipe is a keeper for when I have pumpkin filling leftovers and I will probably post it on my food blog as well. Bravo!",
