It seems like the recipe calls for too much butter. Also I added 1/2 teaspoonful of vanilla extract to the butter/caramel mixture. And right after the oats and butter are mixed but before it cools I added a handful of caramels cut in halves. It got all melty with the granola but still held some form- worked very well. I think this recipe was good but needed something else to add crunch either nuts or Rice Krispies.",

I would NOT do this on high on a flattop stove. I think I will try the oven next time. I used 1/4 cup butter and added 1 cup rice krispies. I sauteed the oatmeal/brown sugar/cinnamon mix for 4 mintues on high but it was starting to burn already. I removed it from the heat to add the butter and it continued to burn even after I added the butter and caramel sauce. It looks burnt and tasted burnt but I will continue to use it in my granola bar recipe because I dont want to waste it. I think its a good idea for making granola but I will put it in the oven next time on wax paper. Let you know how it works out.",
