I've tried quite a few banana bread recipes and usually go for the ones with high ratings and a lot of people that have tried it but I decided to try this one because it  sounded interesting.  I thinking creaming half the bananas with the sugar was a great idea.  The cinnamon and sugar on top also added a great flavor.  I split up the mixture and put it into 2 5x9 pans.  They made smaller loafs and I cooked it for 55 minutes total.  I did put in a teaspoon of cinnamon because I love it.  I did rotate halfway as well.  I will be using this as my future banana bread recipe... it was that good.",

My teenagers asked me when they could have a piece even before it was done baking. I baked it for an hour and 15 minutes like the recipe said I think next time I will try taking it out 5 or 10 minutes before that as the top looked like it was starting to get too dark and the crust was a bit too hard for me. Otherwise a GREAT recipe!",

I've never left a review because I'm usually just too lazy to be honest so this is a first for me. This recipe is AMAZING. Every time I've made banana bread there is always something that seems to be lacking. Too overdone on top not enough banana flavor not moist enough it's never just been PERFECT. Well THIS is. I'm sitting here laughing because when I gave a piece to my husband to try after it was done I was literally jumping up and down saying YES! YES! FINALLY! That's how perfect it is. I know some of the other recipes on here may stand out due to their bazillion stars but trust and believe this is one serious underrated banana bread! TRY IT! You will NOT be disappointed!",

However muffins tend to be drier even if I reduce the oven temp or the baking time. About 2 months ago I had 4 very ripe bananas & all of my recipes called for 3. Not wanting to throw away the extra banana I thought to search for a recipe that called for 4. I found this recipe & since the bread was going to a church function I made a loaf. Best darn banana bread I ever did eat.( Yep I'm a Georgia girl.) Not sure if it is the extra banana the sour cream or both but the moistness & texture was awesome. Of course I couldn't wait to make muffins & they turned out great. Right out of the oven they were slightly crisp & chewy on the outside & moist on the inside. When I take one out of the freezer I microwave it for 30 sec. Then put it in the toaster oven to crisp the outside. By the way I threw away all of my othe recipes.",

It is much too dense/heavy for my liking. Heavier would have been welcomed but it has to have some fluff to it as well. I bake a lot and don't think I would use this again as written. However it DOES have terrific flavor to it and it doesn't fall apart on you! Those are two things I did love about this recipe. I might talk to some others and see what I could do to tweak this recipe to try it again with better results because it has a lot of potential. I would like it a whole lot better if it wasn't so flat & so heavy. It doesn't bake like a real loaf of bread and needs something to help fluff it a bit and get it to raise up better (maybe baking soda and less egg?) because it didn't rise much at all when it baked. It does have great potential with great flavor and no mess which I did love but it just needs the fluff factor and it would be great! Also loved the idea of sugar & cinnamon sprinkled on top... great addition!",
