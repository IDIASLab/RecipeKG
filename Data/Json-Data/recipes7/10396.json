I do realize that the name makes reference to peanut butter twice, still thought it heavy however. Other reviewers liked the amount so maybe you would too. I do think this would make a great peanut butter frozen pop.",

I added 2 more tablespoons before it was done. However I am now thinking 2 1/2 tablespoons total would have been good. I tasted it before adding extra and it had this awesome peanut butter icecream flavor. However I knew there was no way it would get completely thick. I then reheated it with the additional cornstarch which completely thickened it but gave it that slightly boxed pudding taste and texture. I would have to work on the perfect amount. I used shelf stable whipping cream Trader Joes brand and Planters creamy natural peanut butter.",
