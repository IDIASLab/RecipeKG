As a daycare provider I am always looking for creative things for the kids to do too!:-) Many reviewers felt the taste and/or sweetness was lacking. I compared this recipe with my favourite peanut butter recipe and it was similar with the exception that my recipe also called for 1 cup brown sugar (I always loosely pack the brown sugar) and one more teaspoon of vanilla. So you could add these two extra items if you prefer a sweeter cookie! I personally find that this recipe with these added items made a nice cookie. I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and the red M&M chocolate candies to make the reindeer Rudolph's. I would recommend that you bake your cookies for 8 - 10 minutes to start as mine only took 9 minutes to bake to a golden brown on the bottom. Using my small cookie scoop which measures a level tablespoon of cookie dough I was able to get about 6 dozen reindeer cookies from this recipe. The kids and I enjoyed making these cookies!!!",

It worked just fine but we realized we were going to have a ton of cookies (not that that's a bad thing!) so we moved up to a full Tbs per ball which also worked great. Either way the peanut butter cookie with pretzel is a winner!",

I just sorted everything out and put them in bowls for them. I used red m&m's for the nose and choc chips for the eyes so they're like Rudolph. I'm not sure of the size balls that the author was making we made pretty good sized cookies and made WAY more than 24- which is great when you have a ton of people to give to. As far as taste goes- they're alright. I've had better pb cookies. I used off brand pb so maybe that's why? And at least for my oven anything over 10-11 mins would be over-baking them. Overall a fun cookie to make with your kids or grandkids!",
