The cucumbers will weep a tremendous amount of liquid, especially if you let this sit all day or overnight.  If you do not use a firmer yogurt to start, you will end up with a watery Raita.  Since you used regular yogurt and actually added water, perhaps you either used fewer cucumbers, did not let yours sit in the refrigerator to blend the flavors as long as I did, or perhaps you just like it watery.  While I agree that Raita should be saucy, I do not think it should be watery, hence the Greek yogurt.",

Also, it was good, but I thought there was too much yogurt. But maybe my cucumbers were just small. Sounds like a personal problem. :-)",

It's also awesome as a salad!\nI used 1 regular, peeled cuke and shredded it with the corse side of a box grater. I put it in a fine sieve and sprinkled it with some kosher salt, stirred it well and sprinkled another pinch of salt on it. I let this drain @ 15-20 minutes while I assembled the other ingredients. This draws out much of the moisture and keeps the cuke from watering down the raita. Otherwise, I followed the recipie as printed, cutting all in half since I only used one cuke. This was a FANTASTIC topping for Yakuta's Indian Style Sheekh Kabab elsewhere on this site. In fact, the two go together so well, I'll not make the kababs without this raita!",

This raita was okay as a condiment for rice biryani and on top of naan but it was missing something. We couldn't figure it out. Maybe some cumin would help the flavor.
