I searched for drop doughnut recipes and took one of those and adapted it.  This is a very close version of the one I had at the fair in looks and taste. The fair's version was cherry-flavored, but you could use any flavor you like.",

It would be really fun to make a rainbow of flavors/colors for a party, or match the colors up with the occasion - holiday colors or your sports team for example.

I did find that I had to add a bit more milk as the batter was initially WAY too thick, but no big deal. \"Thick pancake batter\" is the right description of what you want.",

Even with adjustments, the sugar/Kool-Aid mix had some strong, sometimes bitter or chemical, tastes due to \"raw\" Kool-Aid pieces being in there.  The dough, conversely, had very little flavor of the Kool-Aid but it did turn a nice color.  Another person wrote that she couldn't prepare these without them turning brown on the outside- that's true, fried foods will always brown up so be prepared to not have lovely full-colored doughnuts on the outside.  The inside is another story.  Most frustrating was the thinness of the batter.  Because there was little cohesion, the batter would fall in strings into the fryer, leaving tails on some doughnuts, a lot of loose pieces in the pot, and making a truly round drop dough was impossible except for rare mistakes.  Because of all these issues, I doubt I will ever go to the trouble to make them again.",
