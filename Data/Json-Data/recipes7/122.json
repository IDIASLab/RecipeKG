And the lemon juice struck me as odd for some reason so I subbed apple cider vinegar instead (only 1/2T). I also used only a 1/2T of sugar and that along with the apple cider vinegar made it sweet enough. The feta in this recipe is wonderful. And like others I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat all of this salad by myself so I kept the broccoli separate from the \"dressing.\" Outstanding recipe! Next time I'll throw in some crumbled turkey bacon! Thanks!",
