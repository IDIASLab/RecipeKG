These are very moist and great reheated as well.  I did try this once with frozen blueberries and that worked as well but fresh peach is best.  I will try other frozen fruit as the seasons change.\nUpdate - I've now made this at least a dozen time's and wanted to add that shredded apple is a VERY close 2nd substitution for fresh in-season peach.  A little sprinkle pf cinnamon-sugar and you have a great start to your morning.",
