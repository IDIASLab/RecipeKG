Obviously, this isn't an every night side, but something to mix things up a bit for a special occasion (the special occasion it was created for was a Tie Dyed themed baby shower).  Regardless of your color stance, this is one of our family's favorite pasta salads and a nice change of pace from the standard italian dressing based pasta salads.  I do recommend adjusting the sugar to your personal preference.  Enjoy!",
