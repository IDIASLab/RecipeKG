The recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of warm water but there is no use for it in the instructions. I ended up using a few teaspoons because the chocolate mixture was so thick but not a full 1/4 cup. There was also no sugar called for in the mousse. I added 1/4 cup thinking the water was a typo. I'm happy I did because the mousse would have been too bitter without it.",
