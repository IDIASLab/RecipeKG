I used garlic infused olive oil and GF Tamari low-sodium soy sauce. I omitted the salt as I didn't want the dish to be too salty. To make it easier, I just whisked the soy sauce, chicken broth (per author's suggestion), sugar, black pepper, and a little ground ginger too. Then, just add in the sauce mixture in step 2. There was too much excess sauce, but I liked being able to use some of the sauce over cooked white rice. Thanks for the recipe!",

Anyway, I like a deeper infusion of Sesame so I added a little to the Grapeseed oil for saut\u00e9ing and then did the drizzle at the end.  Beef broth instead of water adhered the flavors better for me.  My Bok Choy was tender yet crispy.  I intended to have it with some Brown Rice but ended up eating it all by itself.  As a Vegetarian it makes a wonderful main dish or an exotic side.",
