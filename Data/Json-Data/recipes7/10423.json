I thought I might like this cake mix eggnog cake recipe better than the one I tried yesterday as this one included butter and the other did not. I did not find this greatly improved - even with a 1/4 cup of butter and four eggs the cake was dense but wimpy and spongy. Further I found 1 tsp. of nutmeg in addition to what is probably in the eggnog to be overkill. Half that much would have done nicely. The cupcake unfortunately was probably saved by the excellent buttercream frosting I chose to use. As this recipe's first reviewer I wish I could have rated it higher.",
