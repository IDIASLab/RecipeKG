Definitely make sure you let the zucchini drain after grating it as it is extremely juicy I took a large spoon and mashed it in the colander to get a lot more juice out. I tried it in a bundt pan which took about 50-55 minutes and came out extremely moist. Highly recommend this recipe!!",

And I used half white and half whole wheat flours. And to get the moisture out of the grated zuke just squeeze it in your hands. Very moist and delicious. With the spices it kinda reminded me of pumpkin bread. We loved this more than the chocolate zucchini cake. I made it twice this week already.",
