I followed the directions and changed nothing (except the serving size) and it is just right for the tastebuds in my family. I placed the dressing in a large mixing bowl. I had a whole head of cabbage to work with so I shredded the whole head and added cabbage to the dressing in the bowl till it suited my taste. I refrigerated the slaw for several hours and checked for \"soupiness\". The dressing was a little runnier than before which is quite normal for slaw dressing made at home so I added more shredded cabbage. As a note: salt and sugar break down the cellular walls in fresh produce and make stuff begin to \"weep\". This is well noticed when you sprinkle fresh strawberries with sugar or fresh cucumbers with salt. So yes the sugar and the salt make the cabbage \"weepy\" but this is normal for coleslaw. This is a great recipe for homemade slaw dressing.",

As long as you are careful about the amount of dressing you use on the slaw it is fool proof. The recipe as it stands makes enough dressing to float a Reagan class aircraft carrier. On the bright side it will keep for a week or two in a tightly closed mason jar in the fridge. I've made this several times and it is perfect as is but you can add dill weed anise seed and cayenne pepper and give it a slightly different attitude.
