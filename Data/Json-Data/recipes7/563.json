        "description": "Original German rabbit stew recipe passed down from my great-grandmother who immigrated to US in 1889. This is a lot of work to make but well worth it.  It is an acquired taste dish; once hooked, you can't get enough. Serve with fresh mashed potatoes and celery sticks.  Use the stock as gravy for mashed potatoes. Always tastes better as leftovers. Hope you enjoy!",
