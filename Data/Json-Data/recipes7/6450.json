The filling turned out perfectly with the modification. Instead of coring the cupcakes, I filled mine with a bismark tip. It is one of my most requested cupcakes flavors. I should note that I did not make the frosting, as I already am in love with another white chocolate frosting, Kittencal's White Chocolate frosting from Food.com. All in all, the tartness of the fresh raspberry filling, the delicate white cake, and the sweet white chocolate frosting truly makes a heavenly cupcake!",

My Aunt and Grandmother owned a bakery in NYC for over 20 years. These were at hit. I followed the recipe exactly except I strained the seeds from my raspberry filing and I used heavy whipping cream in place of milk for the frosting. I piped the frosting onto the cupcakes and used the leftover frosting for my daughter's smash cake. Amazing! I used an apple corer to cut out the cupcake center which worked perfectly. The filing set up perfect. It stayed in place no sinking. These were really lovely to serve and impressed my family.",

The only thing I did different was adding about a tsp of almond extract to the cake mix and also when I cut the inside of the cupcake out I actually used an apple corer and cut a core shape out and removed the top part and put it back on the cupcake before I iced it. The first day I made the cupcakes I didn't really like them but after they sat overnight and I tried one and the filling had time to sit and soak into the cake part they were awesome! I took a little of the buttercream and used some green coloring and made leaves on top and cut extra raspberries I had in half and decorated the tops with them they were super cute! I am thinking about trying the recipe with other fruits as well...",

However the icing was far too sweet for my sister hubby and even my 3 year old nephew. My 4 year old daughter had no complaints but the rest of us ate our cupcakes with a good 3/4 of the icing removed. I strongly suggest a different icing or cutting down on the amount of icing per cupcake for this one.",
