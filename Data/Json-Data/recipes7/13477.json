The ones in the store and FF places are almost ALL cabbage and NO FLAVOR. (However we still really like JITB ones!) They freeze well BUT make SURE you cook them BEFORE freezing.. my first time i found they got sticky and ripped when I defrosted them and attempted to fry. Fish sauce really smells AWFUL & I found you HAVE TO USE IT to get the correct flavor. I dislike oysters but I love oyster sauce! If you're leary find a large oriental market to find a small bottle of the fish sauce. I got a 1.5 oz bottle the first time.",
