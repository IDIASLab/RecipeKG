The instructions for assembly just didn\u2019t work for me \u2013 nor did my alternative, tho\u2019 I believe it\u2019s the better of the two options.  The common problem with both methods is that there\u2019s just not enough batter to divide in half and \u201cspread.\u201d  If you \u201cspread\u201d enough batter to cover the bottom there\u2019s not NEARLY enough to \u201cspread\u201d on the top.  I added the blueberries to the batter rather than in two layers, and it would have been an even bigger nightmare to \u201cspread\u201d had I not.  As I tried to \u201cspread\u201d the second half of the batter, the batter took the topping WITH the offset spatula.  I tried my best I but I nearly pitched the whole thing in sheer frustration and disappointment.  But I figured I had nothing more to lose except the cost of the electricity to bake this mess. Topping it with the remaining cinnamon mixture camouflaged the disaster underneath, but I was anxious to see what it looked like inside.  It took longer to bake than indicated, and now I\u2019m calling this a complete and total failure.  I let it cool, cut into the slightly overbrowned topping, carelessly plopped a piece of the cake onto a plate and tasted\u2026. it was heaven.  Moist, buttery rich, with a sweet and flavorful, cinnamony topping.  No, I\u2019m not throwing this out.  No way. It might not meet my standards in terms of prettiness for Hubs to take to a meeting tomorrow as planned, but we\u2019ll enjoy every crumb of this difficult and ugly cake.",

When spreading the batter and layers, there was a point where I thought the recipe didn't make enough batter for the pan, but I decided to trust the recipe and it turned out great!  \"Spreading\" the batter after putting the layer of berries and sugar/butter crumbs was a little tricky...but it turns out fantastic!  I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream; more nutritious and less fat.  Definitely recommend this recipe!",

Anyway before I made this I reviewed the comments and agree it would have been a challenge to divide the batter and spread the top layer. So I made the batter then folded the blueberries into it. Then I put the crumble topping on top before baking (I should have halved the topping bc it was a bit thick and crunchy). It was also easy to make. I made this for my fellowship meeting tomorrow and HAD to try it first. I loved it. The cake was so moist and the blueberries were delicious. It was like eating a fluffy blueberry streusel muffin.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of how to halve the batter in the pan. I did the exact same thing with the other half of the batter. I had no problems with it being done this way. I took off one star because this took an hour and twenty-five minutes to bake. At the one hour mark, it wasn't baked in the center. When this had cooled slightly, it was moist, rich and buttery tasting. This really is a great and easy recipe that I will be making again.",

I didn't have any issues with making the layers, I simply plopped the blueberries on top of the first layer of batter, creating a deep ribbon of blueberry in the middle and did the same with the remaining batter.  It doesn't have to be a smooth layer, there is baking powder in the mix, and it helps puff up the batter and topping.  I added a little bit of nutmeg and mace, as these are alway my fav spices with cinnamon.  Don't be put off by the reviews...this is a keeper!\nI just made it again tonight, with some extra blueberries, and subbed part of the sour cream for vanilla yogurt.  Creamy and rich, and a little less fat.  I would like to tweak this recipe to get the fat and calories down,  maybe next time!",
