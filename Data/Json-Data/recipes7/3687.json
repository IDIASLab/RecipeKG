I used half the sugar and chili powder (I buy cp from the Indian grocery..it is hotter) called for in the recipe. I blended the soup with a hand blender and added leftover cooked basmati rice and chopped cilantro. Next time I think I'll leave out the cream and serve it with a dollup of yogurt and sprinkle with chopped cilantro in the style of our fav mulligatawny recipe. I might also try this with coconut milk instead of cream. Even with half the chili powder my kids thought it was too spicy but again my Indian husband loved it. We'll make it again with adjustments.",
