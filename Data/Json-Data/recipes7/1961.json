So I stuck with the olive oil and this still came out excellent. My Chinese husband also loved it. I mixed all the ingredients (except fish) together to make a sauce and cooked the fillets in tinfoil packets with a little sauce on each one in the oven at 425*F for 12 minutes and it came out perfectly. Very good, will be making this one again!",

Used one piece of rainbow trout (12-13 ounces) and since I was planning on baking this in the oven, I mixed all of the ingredients together to marinade over the trout (did use brown sugar instead of white and sesame oil instead of olive).  Left for about 4 hours and then baked at 350 for 25 mins.  Lots of flavour, the change to sesame oil is a must as it complements the other ingredients so nicely and I feel the brown sugar does too!",

                "reviewBody": "5* with adaptions from other reviews.  I've tried grilling & baking a 1 lb. whole filet, wrapped in foil. The foil method was more moist & flavourful. First time, I followed the recipe except used sesame oil instead of olive oil & found it needed more flavour. Second time, it was amazing with these changes: Put large piece of wide, heavy-duty foil over cookie sheet. Place fish on foil & pat dry with paper towel. Increase soy sauce to 1 tablespoon & rub all over. Season top with salt, fresh cracked black pepper & brown sugar, instead of white. Seal foil loosely so it doesn't touch top of fish & marinade up to 2 hours, in fridge. Use sesame oil instead of olive oil & increase garlic & ginger to 1 + 1/8 teaspoons each. Tip: Freeze ginger to grate as needed. Saute onions & ginger first & add garlic last 3 minutes, to prevent burning. Spoon saute mixture on top of fish, loosely re-seal & bake at 425 for 12 minutes. To test if done, stick fork in top of fish & turn. If it flakes easily, it's done. If it's firm & feels like it needs a knife to cut through it, bake 2 more minutes. Let fish rest 5 minutes before unwrapping & removing skin.  Thanks Kerri for a great recipe!",
