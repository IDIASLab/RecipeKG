I also let my date chunks sit in the coffee for about 15 minutes & in that time, they pretty much dissolved - which made a very smooth batter.\n\nFlavor is superb. Very easy to make.

It was still very liquidy. Instead of baking it for an hour I soon realized the cakes were browning way too fast and had to shorten the time to 40 minutes at 150 C. The taste was similar to the tradiotional Jewish honey-cake. Since I don't like that cake I didn't like this cake either. I presume date-lovers will love it since I was very moist and sweet but overall- I wouldn't make it again.",
