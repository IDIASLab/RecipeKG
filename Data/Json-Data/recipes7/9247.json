I didn't make the frosting as I tend to believe most cake is sweet enough and I felt this to be true with this cake. I did top about half the cupcakes with marshmallows which kind of ended up making for a melted crusty gooey type top. Kind of interesting...I must say though that there was one cupcake left out of all the ones I took to work by the end of the day. Not bad at all especially considering I also had on the tray a coffee cake. I count these as a success and they were incredibly easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!",

Next time would cook about 12 min on 335 convection then put marshmallows on and pop back in the oven for about 2 min. I used the flat marshmallows this time and were kind of cute. Then while warm cover with icing. Set up nicely and looked great. Made for a work lunch big hit. I have made these now 4 times and they were amazing and a huge hit every time. I think ideal # is 18 per batch but can make up to 24. Cook12-17 min depending on size. Put the mallows on and then put back in for a few min to brown. Have also made with 1/2 splenda and still taste great.",
