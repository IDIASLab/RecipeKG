One last riff of about a 3rd cup whole milk just to bring a level of creamy and it was a hit for the whole family!",

Therefore I followed this one to the T. Putting the soup in the blender holding down the lid and hitting pulse as directed resulted in first degree burns on my face. I didn't mind cleaning soup from all over my kitchen as I was more concerned with the blisters on my face and ear. Luckily I had on long sleeves so the rest of me survived. I highly recommend NOT hitting pulse but rather just blend on low. I also let it cool for awhile before continuing. I sure hope it tastes good!",
