I really liked the cake part of this recipe. It was moist and had a nice flavor to it. The frosting was really sweet and kind of grainy the grainy could be my fault I've never made a cooked frosting so I'm not sure if its supposed to be that way or not. I was also kind of confused about how much sugar was supposed to go into the frosting. The ingredient lists 2 cups but the directions say 1. So I used one then tasted but I thought it wasn't sweet enough so I added the other cup of sugar. It ended up being to sweet once I put it on the cake. But I don't know if it was supposed to be 1 or 2. I'll probably make the cake part again but use Ricks Special Buttercream Frosting for the frosting part. The frosting wasn't bad it was just not for me.",

You really have to let the butter and sugar mix until there isn't any grainy bits left in the icing and then beat in the flour/milk mixture. I like making this as a xmas dessert and decorating the top of the cake with marzipan pointsettia leaves and flowers -not the real ones as they are a bit poisonous. Just mix some food colour into your marzipane - yes you might have to make some using almond paste. and then make a template of pointsettia leaves and flowers and have some fun. You can make a large decorative cake and use a large flower for it and then make a 9 x 13 cake and make a smaller flower for each slice.",
