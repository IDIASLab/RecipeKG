I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil as well as diced grape tomatoes instead of one large tomato as they're both what I had on hand. I also shredded my own sharp cheddar instead of using pre-shredded as well but it was still sharp cheddar so that's not a drastic difference. It was pretty easy to make and enjoyed by all and I will definitely be making it again!",
