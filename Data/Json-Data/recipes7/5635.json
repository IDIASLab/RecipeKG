I used 3/4 c of sorghum flour plus 1/4 cup of brown rice flour in place of the soy flour. They were heavy like bricks. I also believe that 1.5 Tbsp of baking powder is way too much. I used one tbsp and there was an acidic aftertaste. I used coconut oil for the vegetable oil. For such a thick batter the oven temperature burnt the tops and left the bottoms raw. If I were to make these again I would use a lighter flour mix reduce the baking powder and reduce the oven temperature (increasing cooking time).",

Also I added some spices since there were none in The recipe cinnamon nutmeg cloves and allspice...still they are kind of tasteless Future batches will include 1/2 c almond milk and at least 1t cinnamon.",
