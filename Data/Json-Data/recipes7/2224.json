(provided you don't serve it to kids) stir in your mix a good shot of vodka or favorite \"sweet liquor\" like peach schnapps, kalhua (coffee) or baileys.  The alcohol keeps it from freezing to a rock.\nGreat - simple recipe! Will keep churning!",

I made this recently and could not stop eating it!  It is SO good!  If you like true frozen yogurt.  It does get very hard in the freezer after awhile which doesn't bother me but just let it sit out for a little to soften up if you prefer it that way.  You can also add pureed fruit to the mixture before freezing to make flavored yogurt.  I plan to try using low-fat yogurt next time. ***UPDATE: made this with 2% yogurt and half sugar half sun crystals (Stevia and cane sugar) and was disappointed.  It froze really quickly in my ice cream maker then got rock hard in the freezer.  Won't be making the lighter version again anytime soon.",

Make sure you STRAIN the yogurt ( place a mesh strainer on top of a bowl, put some nylon or cheese cloth on it, pour the yogurt on top of the cloth, fold the ends to cover and refrigerate for no less than 6 hours or overnight).... i used fage yogurt and even though it says strained-yogurt i still went ahead and strained it again. i don't have an ice cream machine yet, so i used the freezing directions from the recipe \"peach frozen yogurt\" from Stephanie Norr",

I just whirred it in my blender, froze it once, then scooped it out and blended it again, then refroze. This is SO good. All of it is gone, no leftovers. Next time I'll double it and maybe add a cup of fresh berries. The grtat thing about this dessert is it's cheaper than any prepackaged frozen yogurt you can buy pre-made and I was able to coupon greek yogurt for almost nothing--so this dessert cost so little.",

The texture of this frozen yogurt is nothing short of remarkable. It's unbelievably creamy. I could keep gushing. I used fat-free Fage Greek yogurt but the mouth feel of this frozen yogurt feels like I used nothing but heavy cream. It's just so creamy. Yum. I mixed the yogurt with the sugar and vanilla as directed and then just dumped it straight into the ice cream maker. I added some dark chocolate chips. It's 10:30pm and I just came back to the freezer to eat some more. This stuff is better than ice cream. So so good. I want to tell my husband about how awesome this is but then I know he'll eat some and I don't want to share.",

This was ok and good at the soft-serve consistency and has a very strong yogurt flavor (which is ok it is yogurt put through an ice cream maker). This however turns into a block of hard frozen solid yogurt when allowed to ripen in the freezer so it is best used immediatley. If frozen solid you can leave out to soften but then why do you use an icecream machine. You get the same result if you put some yogurt in a bowl/container and place it in the freezer bringing out to stir a few times before it freezes solid and serving before that frozen solid state.",
