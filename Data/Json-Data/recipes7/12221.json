I halved the recipe and got about 32 1\" cookies (used a cookie scoop). I have no idea how you can only get two dozen 1\" cookies using the entire recipe. I also baked the cookies for much less time than stated about 10-12 minutes in a 350 degree F oven 20 minutes they would have been burned. I realize all ovens cook a little different but I can't help but wonder if the recipe got messed up when Allrecipes posted it. Otherwise this is a great recipe for a great cookie.",

I threw in some pecans and made these. I needed more sugar though and about an extra half tsp. of the Almond Extract. I baked them for about 15-18 minutes. This recipe made over 40 snowballs.
