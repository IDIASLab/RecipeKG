I would highly suggest adding the spices TO YOUR OWN TASTE. I love spices so I will add a lot more. 3) Instead of using shortening in your pastry use softened butter. Make sure the butter is still cool from the refrigerator but able to stir. (By the way I would suggest doing that ANY time you're making crusts and pastries). I hope you enjoy this recipe!",

My husband loved them and he is not a big sweet eater...I am. The reason i rated 4 stars is because i am not good at making pie crust.So i used the frozen crust i keep on hand and i added one tablespoon of butter to the apples while they cooking.And i fried in peanut oil and i use cinnamon sugar to put on after they out of oil They came out very very good.
