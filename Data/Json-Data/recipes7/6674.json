For the sauce I cut the salt way down. 2 tablespoons sounds like a lot to me (I would like to ask the recipe submitter if that is maybe a typo), so I used 2 teaspoons and that was a good amount for us. I also reduced the chili powder by 1/2 and that was plenty for us-I felt 2 tablespoons would make the sauce taste like chili powder only. I tasted the sauce before pouring it over the meat and it was wonderful, so I was happy with the changes I made.  I would suggest checking the temp of the meat about 45 mins into the cooking time - the meat was a tad overcooked, but it was still a big hit with the fam! This paired perfectly with garlic sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. Did I mention the sauce was delish!  I think I will try adding a third kiwi next time!! yummmm",

My only complaint is that some of the sauce cooked into a sugary rock onto the baking sheet and it was very hard to clean. Next time I would line the bottom of the pan with foil as well as over the top making a packet around the meat for easy clean up. Also I would like to try this recipe in the slow cooker to make the meat more tender.",

I lined a casserole dish with parchment paper (made clean-up a snap!) and cooked a pork tenderloin in the oven at 400F for 1 hour. It was delicious.
