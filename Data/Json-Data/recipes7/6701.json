The dough seemed way to sticky with the amount of flour called for in the dough part of the recipie. I hate altering recipies on my first try but like I said it was so muggy and we make a lot of our own bread so I know how that can effect dough. I did end up adding about one cup more flour. This gave me a slightly sticky but smooth looking dough. I had to flour my finger tips to push it up the sides of the pan. The result regardless of the flour issue was so so good. It formed a soft very thin layer between the apples and dough that was almost cheese danish like..but not doughy or under baked. My family loved it and I will positively make it again!",

A little too \"gooey\" with just the brown sugar - going to use half regular and half brown sugar this time. Overall flavor and ease of prep was great. Don't be scared of the yeast batter - it takes care of itself without being fussy. Would be great warm with a little scoop of ice cream or whipped cream - yum!",

I add an extra apple, but 3 is just fine. The dough is super sticky, I add 1/2 cup more of flour, but i've realized that as \"wrong\" as this feels, sticky is OK! I also cut the butter by half in the crumbs (the butter it calls for made my crumbs almost a paste the first time) and add 1/4 cup of ground almond to my crumbs because why not?! DELICIOUS! This has my German boyfriend's seal of approval too! (ps. didn't add the candied lemon peel)",

The taste and texture were good but it seems that the recipe's 400F cooking temperature is too high. The exterior of the cake was brown after just 20 minutes but the center was not done. The next time I make this I will use a lower oven temperature in hopes that it will bake more evenly.... I have made this recipe a second time using 375F cooking temperature and still wasn't thrilled with the way it came out. I wonder if I am overcooking it but if cooked less then the batter that isn't touching the baking dish would still be doughy.",
