        "description": "I have it on good authority  that this is the real deep dish pizza dough that's used in Chicago. The real thing is nothing like bread, or even pizza, dough. It is a buttery, flaky crust that is achieved by: 1) using corn oil (not butter) and 2) minimal mixing and kneading times. The pizza itself is built with cheese, toppings, and sauce, in that order. I suggest you use 6-in-1&reg; tomatoes which are far superior to other brands. Classico&reg; ground tomatoes are very similar. Contrary to popular opinion, cornmeal is not used in the dough by Chicago pizzerias.",

                "reviewBody": "Alright, first reviewer!  I took the gamble on making this crust without any reviews to go off off, and i'm glad I took the chance.  Now let me share my experience to make the next guy or gal more confident about making this.\n\nFirst, I actually made two batches of this dough.  I made one exactly as is, for comparison, and I made another using the dough cycle on my bread machine.  I could not decipher any difference in the finished product either before or after baking comparing the dough prepared as indicated, and prepared in the bread machine.\n\nFor the bread machine crust, I put all the liquid ingredients (water and corn oil) in the machine, followed by all the solid ingredients.  I let my breadmaker run on the dough cycle, which is a 90 minute cycle.  I left the house after that and so the dough sat in the machine for about 5 hours after the cycle had finished... and when all was said and done the two dough balls worked the same.  SO, if you want to save some time/effort, feel free to use your bread machine.\n\nNow, on to the crust.  I can't stress enough the importance of flattening the crust, and then letting it rest for 10-15 minutes before trying to stretch it into the pan.  Otherwise, when you try to press the crust against the sides, it will fall back down toward the center.\n\nFinally, I pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes, added cheese, pepperoni and then the tomatoes, and then baked another 30 minutes.  The end result... soft and flavorful.  Pizzeria style for sure!\n\nA+",

Dumped into an oiled cast iron skillet and topped as directed - cheese first, Parmesan and mozzarella then some left over double tomato bruschetta and some fresh orange bell peppers. 450 for about 23 minutes was all it took. Very nice. A great dough for busy working mom's and dad's who can make the dough in the morning and have dinner ready in a flash that evening. Thanks for a great recipe.",

I lived in Chicago for 20 years and ordered from Lou's two or three times a month. Trust me, I know Chicago pizza. Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is vastly different from other pizzas, so much so that not even the dough is the same. This dough recipe is similar to other hand tossed recipes. Chicago Deep Dish crust is more similar to a buscuit than to bread. However, I agree that Chicago Sytle does not have corn meal in it, but I doubt if corn oil instead of olive oil could make that much of a difference. They're both vegatable oils. I did make this recipe and it is very good, especailly if you add some seasoning like garlic powder but it is not authentic Chicago Style. The Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza is constructed in the order described, just not on this dough.",

I followed the recipe exactly made it last weekend and put it in a freezer ziplock and froze it without letting it rise first. Today (Friday night pizza night) I took it out this morning and put it in an oiled bowl with a towel over it on the counter. By the time I got home from work 12 hours later it was thawed risen and ready to go! I put it in a 12 inch springform pan (the only \"deep dish\" pan I have). I should've made two--it was SUPER thick--like 3 inches (I prebaked it 10 mins as suggested added toppings and baked for 20 mins more--perfect!)! Even with the super thickness my hubby said it's one of the top 5 pizzas he's ever eaten! Totally agree! This is amazing! One of the best cheap easy dinners I've made!",

I really wanted to try this crust but I didn't have the 6 hours to wait so I put it in the oven with a pan of boiling water so it would double in size in the time I had (about 3 hours) and it did work. I am sure the slower 6 hour rise would only make a better crust but I did not have the time. I also used canola oil since that is all I had and using corn oil may improve it as well. I plan to try that next time.\n I didn't have a deep dish pizza pan so I used a pizza stone and a stone with edges so I had a little more of a deep dish and a more normal type crust (I doubled the recipe so I had enough for 2 pizzas). I pre-baked the crust. This made for a crust that was a little crispy on the bottom. If you want a softer crust I imagine you wouldn't want to pre-bake it. I did find that my cheese got really brown though so you might want to add the cheese a little later, especially if you are not pre-baking and want the cheese on top for a more traditional pizza. I added basil and garlic to our crust before baking. We enjoyed this crust and we will make it again.",
