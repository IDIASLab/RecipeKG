I served it with grilled kielbasa with a little brown sugar rubbed on it and yesterday\u2019s leftove hash brown potatoes. Big hit. Thanks for the great recipe. I used 1 & 1/2 t. red pepper flakes, it had some heat ( which we loved) but if you don\u2019t like spicy I would cut it down to maybe 1/4 t. Now go make it!!!",
