I found that the citrus was a little too intense so I will leave out at least 1/2 the amount of the zest next time. I have never made this before so I am not sure how thick this should be. Is it supposed to be spreadable? Mine came out a little like pudding in consistency. Im very happy with it and I recommend this recipe and will make it again. THX.",

The gelatin would not dissolve! Any tips for getting the gelatin to dissolve? Also can somebody tell me if I am supposed to boil the jars after I pour the butter in and seal them or how long does this stuff keep in the fridge? I gave it 3 stars because while it does taste good it's just not a good consistency but I'm not sure if it's the recipe or my lack of experience. Any input on how I can make it better next time would be greatly appreciated!",
