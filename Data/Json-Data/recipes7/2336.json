My version for one 16 oz. serving is: 6 oz. vanilla fat-free yogurt, 1/2-1 banana,  1/2 c. strawberries, 1/3 c. blueberries, all cut in chunks.  Any or all fruit can be frozen (if you don't have any frozen fruit, use a couple of ice cubes)  If you need to thin it out, use any juice, milk or soymilk to desired consistency.  I need to add flax to my diet, so I also toss in 1 T golden flaxseeds.  For a change of pace, substitute any fresh fruit such as peaches, kiwi, cantaloupe, raspberries, etc., and use any yogurt flavor you prefer.  Tip:  Fruits with a thin skin, such as peaches, apples, nectarines and such don't need to be peeled first, just cut into chunks.  Benefits ~ added fiber and all of the nutrients the fruit has to offer.",

Turns out this one scales down quite easily though. I scaled it for 3 servings and it was actually more like 2, but the ingredients were fairly easily measured out so no tweaking was neccesary (which sometimes skews the results and makes a recipe hard to review accurately). We really enjoyed this smoothie. Sweet enough without added sugar and with just enough tang. You can't really taste the berries, (hence the 4 stars) mainly the pineapple/orange, but it was delicious nonetheless.",
