This recipe incorporates two of the essential ingredients of an old fashioned--sugar and aromatic bitters.  However, to build on what another reviewer said, this mix is so simple it hardly seems worth the effort.  Just keep a little simple syrup and bitters on hand if that's your fancy.\r\n\r\nFor a variation, consider a mix that adds maraschino cherry juice and a little orange juice as well.  THAT particular concoction tends to pair best with a brandy old fashioned sweet, or a brandy old fashioned press, but can be just as tasty with the right whiskey or bourbon as well.",
