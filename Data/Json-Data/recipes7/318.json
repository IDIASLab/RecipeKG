I decided to give it a whirl for my Labor Day ribs. OMG!! The family inhaled them!!! The sauce as written was just way too much so I did as one reviewer suggested and just dumped all the ingreds in a bowl on a smaller scale. This sauce is Sweet N Tangy!! After you start eating the ribs with this sauce it gets gradually hotter. It ROCKS!! My new favorite sauce:) Can not Thank You enough CarolinaDarlin:):) I wish I could Breathe this sauce instead of air. LOL",

The quantity is WAY more than I needed so I just squirted a little ketchup in a bowl and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. I didn't put in the butter because the quantity was so small and I didn't have any hot sauce plus I don't like things too spicy. I didn't even cook the sauce because I was in a hurry but the ketchup/vinegar/sugar/pepper flakes combo was just what I was looking for. I'm sure it tastes even better if you follow the recipe.",
