The cranberry-citrus mixture is used in two ways - one portion to marinate the chicken and the remainder as a salad dressing.  The crisp and clean flavor combinations create a light and healthy yet totally satisfying salad that enhances the chicken.  An indoor grill pan may be used to cook the chicken, if preferred.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent. Wonderful fresh light flavor. I was not cooking in my own kitchen so made some subs. Some of which I would have made at home others out of necessity. Bottled lime juice for fresh; olive oil for veg; a splash of lemon juice and a splash of white wine for lemon-flavored vodka; garlic pepper for lemon pepper; chopped iceberg lettuce for bagged Euro blend; no orange zest (no zester); added one-half cup chopped pecans. When I make this again I will use fresh lime juice and the orange zest. HOWEVER...pull out soap box here...if I'm going to all the trouble to use fresh lime juice fresh oranges fresh orange zest I'm not going to risk all that freshness on bagged salad greens. I don't know about other cooks but I've found them unreliable. Sometimes OK other times taste like the inside of a stale empty unused refrigerator smells. Yeah I know canned cranberries and orange marmalade from a jar ain't exactly fresh squeezed!! Bottom line is that we really like this salad!! Update: just noticed that this recipe calls for 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon lemon pepper. Check to determine if your lemon pepper includes salt already. If so either omit salt or make adjustments.",
