My small town of Misawa in Aomori-ken had either a breaded pork cutlet or a breaded chicken breast sliced thin so that there was no need to try to cut the meat smaller in order to fit it in the mouth. With pork it was called \"katsudon\" which was a shortened version of \"tonkatsu\" (the katsu part was from English \"cutlet\") and \"donburi\" or \"meal in a bowl.\" If you used chicken the name changed to oyaku donburi where the oyaku means \"mother & child\" due to having both chicken and egg. I will sometimes make this dish without meat just the egg and veggies (I add mushrooms) and have it for breakfast. Give this dish a try!",

She loved it so much I taught her how to make it and we later made it for her family. Not only is this recipe absolutely delicious and fun to make but it holds precious memories for me now! I do recommend following a recipe for Tonkatsu first to authentically prepare the pork ! And then follow these directions for Tonkatsu Donburi or more commonly called Katsudon!",

I ended up using chicken stock instead of dashi stock too. I made it for some of my family and the overall reviews were positive- also if you're making this meal for four only use about two cups of rice and double everything else! I cooked way too much rice using three cups (I think after I cooked it there was about 11 cups worth of rice.) Overall delicious!",
