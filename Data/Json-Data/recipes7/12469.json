Also, I thought the fat in the whipping cream would be enough to give it that depth of flavor and I was pleased that it did.  I thought it was a little bland and next time would add some onion, maybe a little garlic and rosemary. But the tomato and basil flavor was excellent!  I grow herbs and have fresh basil on hand all year round. PS: I grow my own tomatoes.  Instead of the sugar, I add 1/2 tsp of baking soda so I don't get acid reflux.",

My boyfriend doesn't like \"creamy\" soups so I personally had to make changes to form a compromise(because I love tomato basil soup). I omitted the butter and cream and used 1 cup of whole milk instead. I added onion powder and garlic powder, salt and pepper. I didn't measure it was probably a teaspoon or two. Also, since he does get heartburn sometimes I took another cooks advice and threw in a half a teaspoon of baking soda before adding my spices(don't be alarmed if it foams up just keep stirring). I added all my spices after the boil during the simmer, then added the milk last. Mine came out more tomatoey (as opposed to creamy) but my family preferred that. Me personally I like the recipe as is with just a little onion and garlic powder. Also I was lazy, I only had dried basil, I used 2 tsp. I served it up with a grilled cheese and my family topped the soup with parm cheese. All and all a very excellent base you can customize to your family, so thank you for posting!",
