I had never made a crisp topping that had evaporated milk and powdered milk in it. It was very moist as I was adding it to the top but after baking it had a hard and chewy texture. Adding the applesauce to the bottom layer really brought out the apple flavor but it also made it a little runny. In the future I would cut back on the applesauce and use a traditional topping that used butter instead of milk.",
