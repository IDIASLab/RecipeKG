They didn\u2019t spread easily and I didn\u2019t care how they pressed into the cake.  I rectified this on the second broiled batch by microwaving the marshmallows for 40 seconds on power level 4, and then flattening them slightly before putting them on the cupcakes.  It worked great.  The cake itself has wonderful flavor and texture, so the combination of the toasted marshmallow and chocolate cake is a winner.",

I definitely would NOT recommend this, as they became a big sticky mess and made the cupcakes look the same. The recipe itself actually made closer to 2 dozen cupcakes, so I was able to try something different with the second batch. These came out the CUTEST by using the jumbo marshmallows and cutting them in half. They take a bit more than the 10-30 seconds to brown but it doesn't seem to dry out the cake by keeping them in just a tad longer. Lightly press them down with the back of a spoon and you're good to go! I made these for a baby shower and stuck a piece of graham cracker in to make them seem more like a s'more cupcake. Overall very tasty and cute!",
