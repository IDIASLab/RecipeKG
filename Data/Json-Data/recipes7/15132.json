Great recipe to change up the seeds and millet you have on hand. I did not have hemp seeds so added extra sunflower and oats. I also added wheat bran and oat bran (added 2 tbsp. extra water). Bread was soft and delicious and kept very well without crumbling or drying out but fresh bread gets eaten quickly in our house. Thank you for this recipe!",
