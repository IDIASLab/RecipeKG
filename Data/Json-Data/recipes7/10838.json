I'd made egg drop soup before and thought that sounded perfect, so I started looking up recipes. Since I couldn't quite make any of the ones I found, I combined them to make this. It helped settle my stomach and was super easy to make. Garnish with crushed peanuts, chives, chili sauce, red pepper flakes, and lime wedges.",
