This cake is wonderful. When my mother had to go to the nursing home, I found her recipe written in the back of an old cookbook. I was so excited and have been baking it ever since. In fact, then I started making it for her. By the way, I lost my Little Mama when she was 95 years old. She was a wonderful cook and passed it down to me.",

I also made one similar to it with drained canned purple plums. It was so moist it was almost a pudding. I won a blue ribbon with this at the fair. The fact that it says \"prune\" makes people shun it. If you just call them plums the think it is amazing! And they are correct. Thanks for sharing a truly tasty treat. I hope people will try it.",
