It basically looks like fresh fruit cocktail but the wine-sugar-mint combo is a nice twist for a fruit salad. I added some fresh raspberries and they didn't hold up well in the wine marinade turned mushy. Served with a small slice of angel food cake this was a nice light finish to a Sunday meal. We enjoyed it and will make again.",
