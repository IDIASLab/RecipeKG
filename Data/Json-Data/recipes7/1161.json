Used a lower sodium but a real salt which reduced the sodium to approximately 800 mg (vs. the 1268 in original recipe) per serving. Went for the gusto with the all herbs called for. Skipped the mushrooms and the shortenning. I also used mozzarella rather than swiss as it was on hand. I prepped the potatoes as stated and prepped sauce as indicated too. Layered in crockpot on high 2 hours/low 2-3 more hours. Will make again with the 'srooms and swiss and I am sure it can only get better than it already is.",
