I'm trying to wean my husband off white sugar and butter as much as possible, and this healthy version of his favorite cookie helps tremendously!\n\nFor the reviewers who tried this recipe and didn't have firm, chewy cookies: you have to bring the chocolate mixture to a ROLLING boil. When it still breaks bubbles on the surface even during stirring, then start the 1-minute countdown. I did that, and left the pot on the back burner (set to Warm) for a half hour while my hubby was grabbing oats from the store. The cookies came out perfectly.\n\nAlso, if you want your nice no-bakes a little on the naughty side, add a tablespoon of Nutella. ;) For those of you not used to the applesauce flavor, the Nutella helps mask the taste and add a touch of richness without a  ton of calories.",

I cooked it a full two minutes at a rolling boil on med-high heat (we're at at 5000 ft and need a little more boil time usually). They set up just fine. I might try 3 minutes next time as they were more gooey than the traditional cookie they're modified from. But it's a welcome compromise given the total absence of butter and dairy. Can't taste the applesauce at all works well. They're pretty chocolatey if that's not your jam maybe reduce the coco. This will be a staple in our home now thank you for the delicious healthier recipe!",
