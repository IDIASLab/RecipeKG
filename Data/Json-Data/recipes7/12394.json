I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was more than enough. I made a full batch of these and actually could have added even more nuts. Make sure you do these on parchment paper or a silpat also as soon as they come out of the oven loosen them before they cool. Egg white and sugar are like glue that is great stuck to the nuts but not so great on a sheet pan. Thanks these will be nice to have around during the holidays.",
