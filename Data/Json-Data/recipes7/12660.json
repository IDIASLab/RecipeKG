I basically mixed mozzarella parmesan and gorgonzola together making sure the ratio was about the same. This is soooo flipping good. I've made it twice in the past few months. I also substituted almonds for walnuts because it's what I had and panko breadcrumbs for regular breadcrumbs - again because it's what I had. I don't have an oven (woo weird NYC apartments) so did this in my toaster oven. Played with time an temperature a bit but still as good as I wanted it to be. Have fun experiment - this is a great starting recipe!",
