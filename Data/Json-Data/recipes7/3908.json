Don't worry, these are just pickled eggs with some East Tennessee (Cocke County) tradition added. Note:  These can provide for a very foul smell from the consumer, so, provider beware!!!",

Should stay at least a couple of weeks in the refrigerator,  I used regular white vinegar, balsamic is too expensive to use that much in a single dish. You can also add seasonings that you like, I  added a 1/2 cup of dill pickle juice. Enjoy!",
