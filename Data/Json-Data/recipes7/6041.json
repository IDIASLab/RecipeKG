Place (in this order) the water oil salt both types of sugar in the pan and top with all of the flour (don't forget the 4 tsp in the top list) and the oatmeal on top and place the yeast in last (I used 4 tsp) and process it on dough cycle. Shape into 2 loaves let rise about 45 minutes and bake in greased 4 x 8 pans at 350F for 30 minutes. I actually used 2 identical bread makers and made a batch in each one simultaneously divided into 3 equal amounts (by weight) and put them into 3 ( 9 x 5) pans and baked them for 35 minutes. Best bread I've ever made and I do not ever buy bread",

I noticed in the reviews several bakers had problems with the second rise. The first rise was great and was not over-risen however it rose very little the second time. This may be because I cut the recipe in half although I do that often and have no issues. I finally gave up on the second rise after two hours because I had planned on serving the bread with dinner and hoped it would rise a little during baking. The flavor was ok but just eh for me. This was my most disappointing bread recipe to date.",
