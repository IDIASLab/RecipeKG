I mushed the banana and spread it on the bread before I dipped it in the egg wash so the bananas wouldn't fall out when my kids ate them. I had small slices sandwich bread so one large banana was sufficient for two french toast sandwiches. I think I might add a little nutmeg next time and cut back on the cinnamon.",

As Lambchop's Mom suggested I added a pinch of nutmeg plus 1/4 cup of milk because egg wash was too thick. Next time I'll try white sugar since there is not much in the recipe. A lover of extra crunchy peanut butter I spread it among the scrambled eggs (on 2nd try I'll spread on toast first then add eggs and thinly sliced bananas). Not being fond of pancake syrup (too sweet for me) I drizzled homemade strawberry syrup on and topped with a few sliced strawberries. I didn't lick plate clean like Stevie's dad did so will try making again and hope for better results.",
