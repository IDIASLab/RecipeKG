When she wasn't able to make it anymore, my husband asked if I would take over. I did, and am now required to bring this to every fall family gathering!

Not sure about the sauce. I used Wondra rather than all purpose flour and it turned out gel-like. (cooked too long?) We liked it anyway. Nonnie's Persimmon Pudding will be on our menu from now on.
