Needs to be spiced up a lot more, see the others suggestions.  I myself like it to be a bit more spicy.  I use the Extra Spicy Clamato Juice, put about 10 shakes of celery salt into the drink, use no other brand of Worcestershire Sauce than Lee & Perrins, (others just don't imitate the original Worcestershire, and yes, I came to Canada from England, close to the county of Worcestershire so take my word for it on this one) .... it is a nice drink if you add a pickled green bean or pickled asparagus in it rather than the celery.  The celery is a bit dull for such a nice spicy drink.  The lime wedge is a nice garnish, but I add lime juice (about 1 tsp.) to the drink itself as well.  Also, I add the ice last, not first, it's easier to stir with the pickle (or celery if you insist) as the stir stick.",

This is popular in Canada, but know that tomato juice is NOT a substitute for Clamato.  This drink is meant to be spicy as well, so beef up the hot pepper sauce (Tabasco is what it SHOULD be made with).  As was said in previous reviews, there is no replacement for Lea and Perrins Worcestershire - don't try to substitute - it won't  work.  Try 2 tablespoons Dill pickle juice, but the clincher is to add a couple of shakes of Montreal Steak Spice.  Takes this great drink over the top.",
