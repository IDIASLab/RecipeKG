Also I would cut the onion portion in half. I think the sauce was a little too sweet as well; therefore I would reduce or eliminate the sugar also. Consider adding a small amount of cream to the sauce and also some chopped fresh parsley at the end. The only other suggestion would be a little more white wine than is called for...maybe 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. I hope all of this makes for a better dish.",

Thanks so much for sharing. Made some garlic break and a good bottle of Chardonnay. I cut the tomato paste in half as others recommended. I think it would have been too much if you put the whole amount. Added throughout the simmering more wine. Would add next time more crushed tomatoes to make it saucier.",
