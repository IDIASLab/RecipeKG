Well to cut a long story short we cut the ham thinly and put a dab of the mousse on the side everyone was in heaven. I made up the recipe the day before my dinner party exactly as the recipe instructed since it was the first time making it. I found one of my molds that was the perfect size (1 Quart) and quaintly designed never used it before so I had to scrub it up and thank heaven for Pam because my fingers would never have gotten down into all those nooks and cranny's after preparing the easy recipe poured it into the mold right up to about 1/4 inch from the top and sealed it and left in the fridge till the next day. I didn't un-mold till just before serving. I dipped the mold into a bowl of hot water just to the rim for about 20 seconds and inverted it to a pretty plate that baby slid right out....I felt like such a pro! Unfortunately I didn't even think about taking a photo until about four guests had sliced into it next time I will for sure because there will be a next time!!!! Someone else giving a review said that she thought this was a \"Bavarian Mustard Cream\" well one of my German guests said he had heard it called that in Austria...so that's my new name for it. This recipe will go on my Easter Menu because it pairs so well with ham is so visually pretty for company and most important can be made ahead.",

Didn't change a thing with the recipe. It was light fluffy and not overpowering. All the guests enjoyed it immensely. They asked for some to take to go with their leftovers. I say make it 'as is' the first time you make it for sure. Then you could tweak the recipe by adding some fresh herbs or maybe even a hint of fresh grated ginger. Fabulous recipe!",
