It's easier to get them to try it: ) once they do they are hooked! I find that mixing the goat cheese first then adding sugar then adding the eggs keeps the eggs from being over worked. I shred the beets with a cheese grater than cook & strain them. I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts for crunch. The batter is stiff until you add the beets.",

Only one likes the beets naturally. Cooked in these muffins all three love them and ask for more. They were actually upset I took them to my mom's group. At the mom's group many were left over their reviews were mixed but many thought they were ok with a couple really liking them and a couple not at all. However I did put a bit more beets in it than the recipe called. I will make it again the muffins again.:) I did find the batter to be dry and may add water next time. 2 eggs seemed like too little liquid to me.",

I might make it again if someone else really liked it but I didn't think it was that good. It has sugar of a sweet bread but the cheese is salty; so I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a sweet bread or a salty one. Also mine was a little dry. It could be because I have no measuring devices in the house; another egg probably would have fixed that problem. It beats not having fresh baked bread though.",
