I decided, after I had cooked up the lentils and seen how much there were, not to add all of them.  I probably added about half of the cooked quantity.  I had to improvise a little on my herbs since I was short on the dill and mint so I used the little bit of cilantro I had on hand.  The only other changes I made were to omit the olives (don't like) and add a medium, unpeeled, seeded cucumber chopped.  I also used tomato basil flavored feta cheese.  When I served the salad I added some chopped tomato to each serving since tomato has a tendency to get funky in the fridge.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.",
