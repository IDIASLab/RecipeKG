Great as a sandwich topping (burgers in particular) or use on crackers, toasted baguette slices, or serve a block of cream cheese spread with this marmalade with crackers on the side.  Onion marmalade is a way to take something ordinary and turn into extraordinary, so just let your imagination run wild.  Caramelizing the red onion is key to the success of this recipe, so don't rush it, just let it cook down until it has reached its full sweetness.  \u00ba\u00ba\u00ba\u00ba\u00ba\u00baUPDATE 2.27.18\u00ba\u00ba\u00ba\u00ba\u00ba The inspiration to make some red onion marmalade came from a hamburger I recently had at a local restaurant:  a grilled burger topped with red onion marmalade with crumbled aged blue cheese on top , served on a toasted brioche bun.   OMG, you really should try it, it's sensational!",

My finace went to Ohio with his brother a few weeks ago and had the \"best burger of his life\" which included red onion marmalade. So I just had to try to duplicate it. It was so simple to make and it tasted just absolutely delicious. The balance between the sweetness and acidity was like an explosion in your mouth! The only thing I would recommend is that if you want to yield enough for about 4 to 5 people I would definitely double the recipe. The two large onions I used cooked down to nothing! Overall a 5 star recipe!",
