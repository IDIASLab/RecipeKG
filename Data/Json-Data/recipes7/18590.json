I just knew this would be the perfect finish to the meal with a couple strawberries that are peak season right now in Florida. There are a number of peanut butter blossom cookie recipes on this site I ve tried several and this one certainly measures up well. Although the peanut butter-chocolate heart didn t melt into a blob on the top it s melted when you bite into it (yum!). There s only one issue with this recipe and that is it doesn t tell you what temperature to use. I baked at 350\u00baF and since my cookies were a bit on the large side it did take about 15-16 minutes total time. They were good!",
