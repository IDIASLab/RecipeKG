To those who had this turn out as a thin creamy mess you must simmer the sugar until it is a rich golden brown before adding the sugar. It can't just be thick and boiling. It has to be darkening all the way through. A thick-walled saucepan is best and yes the times are probably for a gas range so plan on more time with a coil or flat top range.",

It is a bit tricky to make though...after reading reviews I decided to add 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white (for a half batch of the sauce). I tried to melt the sugar first and after waiting for it to melt (or even start to melt) after about 15 minutes I added the butter to the sugar I heated up the water and half and half (which I used in place of the heavy cream) to a low boil and added this to the sugars and stirred until the sugar was dissolved. I simmered this for 10-15 more minutes then put it in the fridge to cool. I was a bit conserned that this was going to be to thin but after being in the fridge it did thicken up. I used this with the Butter Brickle Freezer Dessert Recipe making 8 servings of the sauce I had enough for the 2 layer dessert plus more to drizzle on top. Yum definetly a keeper!",
