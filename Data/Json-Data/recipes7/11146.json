Whether you're talking about the brine or post-cure seasonings, this is something that begs for adaptation. Smoked salt, chipotle, or smoked paprika could be used before or after the cure to make things a little loxier, and don't even get me started on the herbs. After the 3-minute cure, you can sprinkle your slices with dill, tarragon, chervil, and/or thyme.",

A few slices were too thin and I left them in the brine one extra minute resulting in those pieces being a touch to salty. Resting in the fridge overnight seems essential to me. It was a little to close to sashimi after only a couple hours. I can t wait to try again. This time I ll use a skinless filet to see if that isn t all the simpler to get perfect quarter inch thick slices.",
