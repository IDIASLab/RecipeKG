When I went to take them out of the oven at 20 minutes they were still liquidy...so definitely add the extra 10 minutes to the baking time. Also I added mini chocolate chips to the cookie dough part. These were a HUGE hit at our family night out! Thanks for the recipe!",

Used box brownie mix instead cuz I was too lazy to prepare all the ingredients. However I'm sure this recipe's brownie would have been fine because to me I don't care the texture if it tastes like a brownie it's a brownie. Added in a bag of mini chocolate chips in the cookie dough. A reviewer said they had problems with the dough sticking to the brownie. Well I fixed that by adding the dough BEFORE the brownie cooled all the way sent it to the freezer for 30 min and after adding the glaze they fused together perfectly. Will make another for my family next. Thanks for sharing!",

I def would put mini chips into the cookie dough batter next time. I let the chocolate chips slightly harden then scored them in 1\" squares and then let them finish hardening. It made it pretty easy to cut. I had a slight problem with the cookie dough separating from the brownies but this may have been because of the small size i cut them. These are really rich but very good if you like raw cookie dough!",
