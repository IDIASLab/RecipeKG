We use whatever beans we have on hand, (try anything, even used garbanzos) use either red or green onion (prefer red cause it's crunchy). Like to use 2 ears of fresh corn roasted on the grill for a couple of minutes on each side or boiled for a few minutes, but in a pinch have used frozen and always use roasted red peppers b/c we don't care for the jarred pimento. \nWe also use agave instead of sugar and don't need to cook the dressing, just mix it all in one bowl and refrigerate to \"marry\" flavors. \nI might go easier on the dressing depending on the amount of beans I'm using, but judge for yourself. \nGreat side recipe to have on hand.

The only thing I did not like about this was the homemade dressing. It was just too sweet for my taste. I prefer the versions that have a little more tangy flavor. With some tweaking on the dressing it would be better. The vegetable and bean combination was nice and it was a very pretty dish. I was surprised that I would like the pinto beans. Never saw Cowboy Caviar with anything other than black beans and black eyed peas. I did think it was a bit too much corn. Would probably use a cup of frozen corn next time.",
