It could use a strudel or a glaze to \"pretty\" it up but it tastes fabulous without. I too added the one cup of milk - I wonder if the cake would be uglier if baked without it? The batter was just WAY too dry and I couldn't bring myself to cut up all those apples for a dry lumpy cake. My husband said this one tasted like a quick bread and wanted to either put butter or cream cheese frosting on it. I'm bringing it to a brunch tomorrow but we sampled a piece each and we agree - this one's a keeper. Thanks! Edited to add: I made this the first two times with canola oil and it was fabulous. When I made it with veggie oil it had a really strong \"oil\" taste to it - I ended up throwing a lot of it away.",

It was also very dense probably because of all the oil? maybe i should have substituted some of the oil with applesauce. The only change i did was to cut down some sugar to about 140g and the sweetness was just nice. This tastes better when chilled though and goes well with a cream cheese frosting to give it a slightly more complex flavour.",
