                "reviewBody": "3.15.16 Followed this recipe with one substitution using sugar-free pistachio pudding mix. Also my avocado was very small so I used all of it. The cookie dough was on the soft side after processing so I did give it about 15 minutes in the fridge to firm up a bit as well as refrigerating it between batches. Not quite as much flavor as I had hoped but I can t put my finger on what s missing. Recipe author suggests using pistachio flavor in place of vanilla but I know that would be yet another thing that I buy that just sits on the shelf. If I make this recipe again I definitely will try almond extract. If you can plan ahead I'd recommend shelling your pistachios in advance because it was time consuming to get 2/3 cup of pistachio nuts out of those shells. Used a Tbsp cookie scoop and ended up with 45 cookies which were about the same size baked as they were before going into the oven (not much rise). We liked these cookies but I wouldn't put them at the top of my list. Kate s Kitchen thanks for sharing your recipe with us.",
