We often serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was the first dish I learned to make 51 years ago at the tender age of 5. Fresh nutmeg is best. If you don't have nutmeg on hand use the same amount of cinnamon. For a spicier style use ground ginger again fresh grated is best. You can also use frozen defrosted peaches or any type of berries. Thanks for handing along a classic and preserving a great tradition.",
