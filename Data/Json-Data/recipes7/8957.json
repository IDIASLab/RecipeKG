Without the extra coconut these would have been too runny, I think.\n\nAlso, a tip... It's VITAL that you let the butter, sugar & coconut cook together until totally smooth. If you rush it, your cookies will turn out grainy & crumbly. They need cook cook together at a BOIL for at least 2 min. You'll know its ready when the mixture is completely, silky smooth. Also-- stir constantly. The sugar will burn if you stop stirring while cooking, giving your cookies a burnt, icky taste. DON'T STOP STIRRING!",

You need to move SUPER quickly when dropping these on wax paper, as the mixture will harden quickly once the oats/coconut (and chocolate, in my case) are added.

Take a glass of cold tap water And after a couple of minutes boiling use the spoon and let a drop of the sauce fall to the bottom of the glass. If it looks like a tadpole it is called a soft boil and it is ready. Too early and it will splatter. Perfect cookies using that method. Also I never go above medium heat. Patience  will make them perfect. Oh yes...and I always add 1Tsp of Vanilla!!!",
