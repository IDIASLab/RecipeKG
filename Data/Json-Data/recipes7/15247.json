I looked at my banana bread recipe that I have been making for 40 years and it did not include the cinnamon or nutmeg.  I left it out.  I thought this looked like a lot of sugar for a recipe that included banana, so I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. We don't normally have almond milk, so I used regular.  Finally, I let the pancake batter sit for 1/2 hour before using, which I read makes fluffier pancakes.   Oh, man were these good.  I will make these again.",

The only thing I modified was the nutmeg. Nutmeg is VERY potent and a little goes a long way. I used a part of an 1/8th teaspoon and still could delicately taste it. Consistency was good but I wish I had let the batter settle a little before cooking it to fluff it up more. This will be made again.",
