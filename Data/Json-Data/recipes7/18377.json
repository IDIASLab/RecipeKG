I filled the muffin cups about two-thirds full and ended up with eight muffins. They had a good rise are extremely moist and tender and have a very rich chocolate flavor. Only change I made was using vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand). I gave each muffin a dusting of some powder sugar but I could see sprinkling a few chocolate chips on the top of each muffin before heading into the oven to style them up even more. Thanks for sharing your recipe this one s a definite keeper.",
