I used plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream as I had some to use up. I added 1 tbsp Kahlua and 1 tsp Espresso powder to the cheese mixture. I used 3/4 cup each of coffee and Kahlua for dipping the ladyfingers my packages were 5.5 ounces each and I used 2. I found it a little sweet would try 2/3 or 1/2 cup of sugar next time. I sprinkled with cocoa and grated 90% chocolate between each layer and on top which helped counter the sweetness. No one could tell it was not mascapone the texture is slightly softer but the taste is good and close to the original. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
