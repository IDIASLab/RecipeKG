If your pies come out runny because your fruit is really juicy, add more flour/cornstarch and let the pie sit in the oven for an hour after you turn off the stove. If you think a cup of sugar isn't sweet enough, add more. Taste your fruit before you mix it with sugar and again before it goes into the oven. Ive gotten so many compliments on this pie I was encouraged to share the recipe on this site.",

It looks and smells wonderful!! Thanks for sharing this recipe! UPDATE: The pie was delicious! I will say that it is a VERY BERRY pie- if you aren't a cooked berry fan you will NOT like it. I loved it. Perfect with icecream. Serve warm. I look forward to making it again. It was an expensive pie to make due to the berries.",
