I followed the recipe and the \"Cook's Note\" and will never change a thing. We have been on a cinnamon roll kick lately and I have been searching for the perfect dough. THIS is it! So tender, they almost melt in your mouth. The orange flavor in the dough, filling and frosting is spot on. The cream cheese frosting...addictive. This recipe is also very easy and quick. They doubled in 1 hour on the first rise. I was serving these as dessert, so no overnight refrigeration. The dough is so easy to work with, that the rolling and filling took approx. 5 minutes to complete and they were in the pan for the second rise. They doubled in 25 minutes and into the oven they went. Exactly 25 minutes later they were perfectly baked and the wonderful orange aroma was filling the kitchen. We couldn't wait. My aunt and I stole a corner roll and ate it straight from the oven. I knew right there that there is no reason to search any further for the perfect recipe. rae, Thank You for sharing your outstanding High Five Orange Roll recipe. We will enjoy it often.",

And after our first bites my husband and I both declared that it might be THE best recipe I have EVER made. I mean I this will definitely be THE Christmas morning recipe for my family and I think I may even refuse to make it any month other than December just to keep a special Christmastime feeling in the taste. It is PERFECTION! I followed the directions exactly other than using 4 cups of bread flour and 2-3 cups of regular flour. Bread flour actually makes for a tougher heartier dough and I like a little of the softer stretchier aspects of regular flour in breakfast pastries. Yes it took me about 6 cups of flour not 5. I added maybe another cup in the mixer and probably another cup kneading. I only kneaded 7 minutes because I kept having to add more flour. I was worried they'd be too dry... but they were perfect! I was also worried because the dough didn't taste amazing on its own but it's ALL about the filling and frosting. The filling ends up caramelized at the bottom of the pan... SO GOOD. I also followed another reviewer who used one 9x12 glass baking/casserole pan and another smaller square one greased bottom and sides saving the smaller pan for another day. Basically these rolls are soft moist stretchy sweet-but-citrusy perfection with a hint of savory (salt) in the cream cheese. You CANNOT go wrong.",

I made the dough but erred several times. I didn't realize it only called for 1/4 cup of the pudding mix until AFTER I had already added the whole package. Also while writing this review and re-reading the recipe...I discovered that I inadvertantly left out the salt. It made no difference. These stilled turned out wonderful. I divided the dough in two uneven portions just to make it easier for me to work with. The smaller portion I made into 9 rolls which I placed in a 9x9 inch pan. The larger portion I cut into 12 rolls and placed in a 9x13 inch pan. (I used a long piece of dental floss slid under the roll criss-crossed on top and pulled to \"cut\" each roll. Works very nicely and keeps the rolls nice and round.) I placed the larger pan in the fridge to save and bake the next day. The smaller pan I let rise to bake the same day. We keep the house cool so I let them rise in a slightly warm oven (that had been turned on for just a minute then turned off) with a bowl of hot water on the rack underneath. After I baked and frosted them hubby delivered them to my friend who raved. I couldn't wait to bake the second pan the next day for us. Well worth the wait! Makes more than enough frosting so I froze some for the next time. Do not leave out the zest as that adds a deeper orange flavor. I will also add zest to the frosting next time.",

I halved the recipe and made these in my bread machine placing all the wet ingredients in first followed with the dry. Once the dough cycle had finished I rolled out the dough I did change the filling slightly to the one in the recipe. I melted the butter and added the orange extract to it (did not use the zest as I am not a fan) brushed this mixture on to the rolled dough I then sprinkled with Brown sugar and cinnamon topped with a handful of raisins. Rolled the dough and cut using a sharp bread knife (the halved recipe made 12 standard size rolls). I placed in the greased dish and covered with film I let these rise for a further 30 minutes in my cold oven with the light on removed and stored in the fridge covered overnight. The following morning I removed the rolls from the fridge and let sit on the counter for about 45 minutes to bring them to room temperature before baking. Once baking I started to make the glaze I used 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice in place of the milk and orange extract. Thank you for sharing this recipe I know I will be baking them again and again!",

If heaven smells like anything it is these rolls my apartment smelled so good while baking them and I absolutely could not wait for them to be done. If you are looking at this recipe and are a first time bread baker do no be put off by kneading the dough. The dough was VERY easy to work with and the 8-10 minute guideline was perfect. My rolls were not dense or mushy at all. I also followed another reviewer and added 5 minutes to the bake time since I was using a glass dish and the rolls came out perfect! I will upload a picture next time I make these because there are none left this morning =) This should be called double high five orange rolls because I will never use another sweat roll recipe again! One more thing these rolls raised a lot when I baked them so make sure you don't cut them too thick or you might be in trouble! Next time I will just divide the rolls into two pans",

I had read all of the positive reviews and figured they would be great. In my opinion they weren't. They had no flavor. I understand I'm in the minority here but I followed the recipe and instructions exactly and they didn't turn out for me. But Rae - I do LOVE your profile pic:-) the rolls just weren't for me.",
