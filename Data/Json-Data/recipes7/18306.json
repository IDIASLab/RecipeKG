One may think this is just strawberries with whipped cream, but once you taste that topping, you know there\u2019s something unique going on.  Although the brandy flavor is subtle, you know it\u2019s there, and it's what makes this so special.  I added no sugar to the freshly-sliced strawberries, just put them into the dessert dishes and added a dollop of the whipped topping.  I didn\u2019t add all of the sour cream-brandy-brown sugar mixture to the whipped cream because it was starting to thin out a bit, look a little \u201csaucy,\u201d and I wanted a firm whipped cream topping.  So very simple, so very easy and quick, and sooooo very good.  Steph, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
