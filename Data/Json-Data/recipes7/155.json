The other ingredients I used were exactly as the recipe called for. I always make substitutes in recipes if I want something and don't have everything here! This chai is just perfect. I love it!",

I omitted the orange peel and the peppercorns and I added in 2 allspice berries. It turned out as a 4 (nice but mild in flavor... I prefer the dry Chai Tea Mix by Jo) but it would probably be a 5 if I had used black tea leaves instead of the instant tea so I'm rating it as a 5! My 3-year old enjoys it too. Thanks Riley!",
