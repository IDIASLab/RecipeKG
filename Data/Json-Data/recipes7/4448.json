I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make latik so I spread sweetened shredded coconut on top and browned it under the broiler for a few minutes. I only had to cook the pudding about 15 minutes before it got thick. Thank you for posting this simple and delicious recipe!",

We usually really like corn casserole type dishes in my family and the kids love corn any way I cook it. However we did not care for this. My husband said it tasted like nutrisweet. (I swear I followed the recipe exactly). My oldest daughter ate some and liked it OK but my other two children wouldn't eat it. I could not eat it either. It was way too sweet. I added a second can of corn after it was done to try to salvage it but that did not help much. It was inedible. I'll stick with my go to corn casserole recipe if I want a sweet corn dish.",

I brought it to a boil then cooked it approximately 20 minutes on low stirring frequently with a whisk. I poured it into a greased 9x11 glass dish. When it was set it was like a soft pudding.
