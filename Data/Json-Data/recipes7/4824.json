I guess the other people who tried this recipe didn't let the syrup part of the recipe cook long enough, therefore, the syrup was too liquidy. I cooked mine for about 15-20 minutes but I guess that depends on the heat settings of your stove. The only problem I had isn't really a problem for me, but even after I used the dry salt/sugar mix at the end, the peanuts still stuck together and were very, very sticky. Other than that, though, this recipe was great! Oh, and I also put some ground up cinnamon in the salt/sugar mix that you add in the end :)",
