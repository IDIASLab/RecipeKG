On the kneading part I just put the dough in the same large bowl as I mixed the 2nd set of ingredients. I sprayed the pan with PAM and it practically fell right out of the pan after baked no sticking at all. All I had to clean was one bowl a measuring cup and a measuring spoon while it baked because the bag was disposable. To top the bread was delicious. Will be nice to make the recipe when my neice and nephew visit. Mine did bake in 25 minutes. Thanks will make again!",

I did make a few alterations only because it was necessary. I did so hoping the bread would still come out amazing and it did!! Excellent recipe. Here are the substitutions I made. In the first loaf, I did not have powdered milk, so after a little research online, I substuted the cup of warm water for a cup of warm milk and did not add the powdered milk. The second time i ran out of olive oil so i used vegetable oil. I still used the cup of warm milk instead of warm water as it came out excellent the first time.. Again, this bread came out amazingly delicious! Other than those changes, I made the recipe exactly as called for in the bag and all. A tip on the bag. if its gooey on the sides.. keep kneading in the bag, it may take a few minutes but it will form dough and seperate from the bag.. Amazingly awesome. thanks for sharing this recipe.",
