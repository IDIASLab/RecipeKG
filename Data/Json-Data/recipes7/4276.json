The first time I made this recipe, hubby was a little skeptical about the turmeric and cilantro, but I followed the recipe as written. It was excellent, but in subsequent batches I left out the turmeric and kept the cilantro (not \"traditional\" in our book, but sometimes it's good to part with tradition!) Also, I've used low fat yogurt and low fat laban - reducing the water added. Both work great!",

The seeds and asofateda smelled great in the frying pan but very little of their pungence came through in the final recipe. Maybe it just needs more of all the spices for my taste. Overall pleasing but not exciting. Sauce was very thin for what I am used to also but this could be traditional Gujarati not sure.",
