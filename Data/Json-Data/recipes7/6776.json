The only thing that I would omit is the bacon. My German mom never cooked it with bacon. It tastes great without it. If apples are not available sugar can be an acceptable substitute. Add it to your taste. This dish is a wonderful balance of slight sweet and subtle sour. Mom never used wine as well but it does sound like an interesting and additional ingredient for a potential savory flavor. My biggest suggestion is to make this with some spaetzle and rouladen and you will absolutely have heaven on a plate. It is by far one of my all time favorite meals! It's the definition of comfort food in a major way.:o)!!!! ausgezeichnet!!!!",

I ve tried a number of red cabbage recipes on this site and hands down this is the best. Seriously it tastes just like the red cabbage you d be served at a restaurant in Germany. Many recipes are too sweet some are just too sour. But this blend of spices (never used bay leaves in red cabbage before) along with the sweetness from the apple and that little bit of sugar balance perfectly with the tang of the vinegars. And what s not to like about some bacon in there??? Yesterday was like Christmas all over (except it's in the upper 80's now); chowed down on sauerbraten and gravy homemade sauteed egg noodles potato balls and the best red cabbage I ve ever had.
