I don't know what kugel is but I DO what pumpkin pie is! This looked similar... I roasted the squash and then pur\u00e9ed the flesh when it was cooled. I used farm fresh eggs gluten free flour 1/4 cup organic cane sugar 1/2 cup pure maple syrup for sweetness 2 T. butter 2 T. coconut oil (melted) 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. pie spice. Mine took about 45 minutes in the oven (mine is slow). I ate a piece immediately for breakfast. Delicious! Sort-of like a custard pie. Thanks for the recipe!",
