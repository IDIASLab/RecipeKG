                "reviewBody": "I'm the submitter of this recipe, and I thought I'd give a few tips and pointers! First, this recipe is very versatile. I tried many different measures of the coffee and sugar and they all worked just fine, I settled on the final measurements just as a personal preference. If you like strong coffee flavor, you can easily add more coffee granules. If you like it more or less sweet, you can add more or less sugar. It's up to you! Also, I always use really ripe bananas. The blacker the better! As for the glaze, I've never had a problem with it, it always comes out just fine. So here's my advice. Make sure you PACK the brown sugar. If you are having problems with the glaze separating, then you might not have enough brown sugar, you can try adding a touch more. Make sure you bring it up to a full boil and simmer for at least 2 minutes (that's usually what I do). I let it cool only long enough for it to stop bubbling, then pour it over the loaf. I just tried tonight adding the vanilla after boiling, and that works great too. Good luck! And I hope you enjoy this bread as much as my family and friends do!",

I made muffins out of this recipe so baking time was 20 minutes at 350*. I was up early enough so I could bake the muffins and let them set a bit before I glazed my muffins. I set the muffins on cookie cooling sheets that I set inside baking sheets, then I used a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the top. This way, any excess glaze would be caught on the cookie sheet. This banana bread is one of the best we've ever had. I've had two muffins myself this morning but my oldest had four and my youngest ate three. We love it. The flavors are just wonderful and I love the hint of coffee combined with the banana, white chocolate and caramel. Really fantastic muffin recipe--thanks for the new twist! We'll make this again soon. EDITED: All gone. My boys finished off the rest of the muffins by lunchtime. Huge hit, Dianne. Guess I'll be making these again!",

I also have instant espresso so I used that. It is moist and delicious. I read on the Buzz that others had the glaze turn out crunchy. Make sure that you lower the temperature and just simmer for three minutes. Otherwise, you'll make penuche. I was taught to always add vanilla at the end off the heat to preserve maximum flavor so I did that in the glaze. I want to try this recipe again using pumpkin puree in place of the bananas. I bet that will be great, too. I will update my review and let you know!",

I did not melt the butter, just cut up in pieces so it would mix easily and sliced the bananas and mixed them with mixer too. I then made muffins instead of bread, baked 350 for 15-20 minutes.  They are the tenderest, moistest, banana bread muffins I have ever had, a definite keeper.  Easy too.",

He also happens to love banana bread, so when I saw what Dianne had created, I knew I had to try it.  The bread is so moist and flavorful, with all of the flavors being subtle and not overpowering.  My only minor issue with the bread was the glaze.  After boiling the ingredients together, mine was very watery and without constant stirring, the butter kept separating.  To make it into a spreadable consistency, I added in some powdered sugar.  Not sure how much, I just dumped some in and mixed it to a light brown frosting.  It was perfect, and we were licking the pan clean after the bread was glazed.  I am sure this will be a repeat in this house!  Thanks for another wonderful recipe, Dianne:)",

It came out absolutely moist and delicious. It had the perfect blend of coffee banana and caramel. The icing just put them over the top. I made them into muffins after reading Sarah Jo's review just because I know my family would eat the muffins over the bread. I baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes and they were perfect. I will make sure I have the ingredients for this at all times because I know it's going be made quite often here (already my second batch in 2 days). Thanks Dianne for sharing this awesome recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Just made this without the topping. It was OK. I used 3 bananas because I wanted a strong banana flavor. Unfortunately even with 3 still not a strong banana flavor. My bananas were ripe but not very ripe. Does that make a difference. I have 3 bananas left maybe I'll wait another few days and make another loaf to see if that makes a difference. Wish someone could tell me if using very ripe bananas is the trick. Don't get me wrong bread was moist. I only had to bake for 50 min. I also think it could use a little more salt and even sugar especially if you are not using the topping. We don't like sweet sweet but this just felt like it needed more. Again maybe if the bananas were riper they would be sweeter and then you wouldn't need more sugar. Hmmmm??? Guess will have to try again..",
