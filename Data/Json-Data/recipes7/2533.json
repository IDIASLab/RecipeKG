It calls for: a peck of tomatoes (12-15 lbs.), peeled and cut fine; 2 quarts of onions (measured, I suspect, after peeling and quartering) ground in a (manual) meat grinder; 6 red or green bell peppers, also ground; 4 cups brown sugar; 4 tsp. salt; 3 heaping tsp. ground cinnamon; 1\u00bd tsp. ground nutmeg; \u00bd box mixed whole spice (which would be about half of a 1.5 ounce jar of today's McCormick pickling spice) tied into cheesecloth; 1 scant tsp. ground black pepper; 1 cup cider vinegar. Cook 3 hours, very slowly, stirring often. To be canned in sterile jars. The end of August or early September is the recommended season (tomato season in the northern U.S.). Were I to make it these days, I think I'd reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup, and grind some seeded jalapenos and/or serranos into the mix. (I laugh now at the \"scant tsp.\" of black pepper. So timid!)",
