I'm glad I tried out your recipe because it's great and the kids love it! I use 1/2 tsp orange extract instead of lemon because that's all I had on hand. I use steel cut quick cooking oatmeal and only use 1 cup. I added 2 tbs of milk because the dough was very thick. I also brush the top with egg white so the sprinkles will stick to the cookies. Roll them thin because the cookies rise up as they bake in the oven.",
