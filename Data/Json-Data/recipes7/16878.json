There must be a typo in this recipe. 1/3 cup milk wasn't nearly enough liquid. I kept adding until I got a batter consistency and didn't measure so I can not tell you how much I ended up using. I at least added a cup if not more. I recommend starting with 1 1/3 cups and then go from there. If you are looking for a light and fluffy cornbread then this isn't the one for you. This is a very dense one. I served this on New Year's Day with Hoppin Johns so I liked the idea of adding spinach and artichokes but it was just ok and not one I'd make again.",
