        "description": "Fall cuisine is typically marked by what many consider to be more traditional and even somewhat austere flavors. Fall cuisine usually boasts 'Old World' flavors such as cloves, walnuts, and cranberries. These are flavors one might have envisioned a puritan family enjoying fresh off the Mayflower. At first bite, the robust 'kick' and bold expression of these little treats will be sure to impress and delight, and possibly even allow one to reminisce on the joys of autumn, from the fading leaves to the memories of a Thanksgiving past.",

I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze on top with a touch of almond extract. Yummy!",

Had no applesauce so instead I used another 1/4 cup butter. I also only used 2/3 cup sugar and I caramelized it. Used 3 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon dried lemon peal instead of fresh ingredients because I really like to have things measured out. Turned out amazing. Will make it the same way next time.",
