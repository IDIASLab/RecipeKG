Even now, years after they began drinking it, they still enjoy it during homework, or after coming in from a cold day of play. I, too, have enjoyed it after a long day's work.

My son made me one with brown sugar and it tasted heavenly. So please feel free to experiment with this to make it your own. Enjoy! I have to give this 5 stars. The combination of flavors is so calm and relaxing. Over the years I have made substitutions like with a sugar substitutes and it is still good. I have been making this for 14 years and our boys continually ask for it. I know that it seems like a lot of sugar. But it really does work with the combination of flavors. When I made it it was by sheer coincidence that the boys became sleepy after drinking it. I did not have any hot chocolate or tea bags on hand as they had been outside playing in the snow and I just made it for them. They went to bed by themselves after having this. I thought surely not. But yes it does put you in a calm state of mind. I have made it with honey when I did not have sugar on hand. It really is good and it is so relaxing. I hope this will be a family favorite for you as it has become one of our's.",
