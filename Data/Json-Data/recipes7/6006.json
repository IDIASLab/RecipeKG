Tonight I put it in our beef stirfry. YUM! This would be fantastic in pork or chicken lettuce wraps. Oh, the possibilities! For the wimps out there, just strain the sauce to remove the pepper (the horror!) before serving and it won't be as spicy. For us though, it's perfect. Definitely need to double this the next time I make it. Oh, and the only change I made was to use one sweetener packet instead of real sugar. Thanks so much for the great recipe Chris!",

It's very good and I think it would go well with a lot of different foods. I bought a lot of habaneros and actually made 3 recipes with them today (!) and this is my favorite. I'm already planning to make more of it.",
