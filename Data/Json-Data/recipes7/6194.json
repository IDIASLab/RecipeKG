Cooking on High for 1.5 hours worked best, stirring occasionally (2 hours made the pearls pretty mushy).  \n\nUsing 2 egg yolks worked for me, and that's the QTY of yolks in the original video for this recipe.  The original also called for 2 Tablespoons of vanilla.  I love vanilla, so I use that amount. It will seem SOUPY even after you add the yolks and let it cook for 20-30 minutes - don't worry, because it will set up nicely after it cools and chills.\n\nBest tapioca recipe I've ever found..........creamy, yummy comfort food!",

I tried cooking it on low and then warm and finally succumbed to high. It finally started thickening and I then over cooked it. I will continue to make it stovetop because I can't babysit my slowcooker. If you have one of the older crockpots I think this would work much better. It still is very tasty. BTW I am going to keep my eye out for an older and slower crockpot. I did serve this over a puddle of grand marnier and the orange liquer was a very nice addition.

I did cook 3 hours on high before adding the egg yolk since it was such a large batch. I also like to use the egg whites beating them to a stiff peak with a little sugar. I folded these in 30-45 minutes after adding the yolks. (This was about how much time it took for the pudding to start to thicken.) You may have to wait longer for your tapioca by cooking it in the slow cooker but I love not having to stand over the stove! This is the way I'll be cooking it now.",

My slow cooker worked beautifully on the high setting as long as I remembered to stir this occasionally. I did once substitute 1/2 cup of cream for 1/2 cup of the milk for a wonderfully rich and flavorful pudding, but it was also delicious using only the milk. My family thought this lovely with fresh strawberries, chilled, but I enjoyed it while it was still warm.  If you've never had homemade tapioca, forget you've ever tried that store-bought packaged stuff.  This is the way to go!  Thanks for the great recipe!",

At first I was worried about the consistency because it looked thinner than I am used to when it was done. However it thickened up nicely when it cooled. Something about the flavor is a little off for me though and it also tastes a little salty. I may try making it again but use only 1/4 tsp. salt and maybe use two whole eggs instead of two egg yolks. As much as I like vanilla I think that I would only use 1 tsp vanilla next time too so I can really get the tapioca taste I'm looking for.",
