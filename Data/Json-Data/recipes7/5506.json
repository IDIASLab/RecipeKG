Otherwise the presentation is great and the taste is wonderful. This could be used for any fruit that is preferred. To make the \"tulip\" I used ramekins and I had a very small pyrex dish that worked as well - in fact it did the best. I had one of those and 4 ramekins... it's most effective to use those. Also cook 2-3 at a time. It takes some time to get them off the cookie tray and into the mold for an optimal shape.",

We just slapped on some of the filling and dug in. The taste was fabulous and the presentation was beautiful for the one cookie that worked for us.",

I had to toss them out as they were completely unusable. I did break a piece off prior to tossing and wasn't a big fan of the flavor. The butter was a bit too bold for my liking. The recipe says it yields a dozen but I was only able to make seven after measuring the batter exactly as it's called for. I opted to make the cups without the filling as I was going to fill with homemade ice-cream so I can't comment on how the strawberry concoction turned out!",

I baked about 6 at a time and molded them over mini muffin tins. By the time the next batch was cooked I was able to remove them. This made a nice hand held dessert. I made two batches. For the second I omitted vanilla and added 1 tbsp Kahlua. These I topped with with a drizzle of chocolate syrup yum! Also I used real whipping cream-1 1/2 cups whipped is the correct substitute for the cool whip. Update: I have made these 3 times now. Love them. Once I use blueberries and pushed the plup through a seive. They were great as well.",
