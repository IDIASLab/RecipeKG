I used 1 egg 1/4 cup COCONUT milk and the extracts instead. Even this adjusted amount may still be too much. Add just enough of the combined liquid only until mixture comes together to form a biscotti-like dough. I used 1-1/4 cups of sweetened coconut flakes and 1 cup currants as well. Drop tablespoons of the dough on parchment-lined cookie sheets (do not compact) and press in 3-5 halved macadamia nuts on top. Bake as directed until tops are golden brown. You will not be disappointed!",
