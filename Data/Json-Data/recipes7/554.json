I'll post a full recipe when I've perfected it but for now I'll say use dark corn syrup instead of molasses and only about half as much. Use a full cup of butter. Instead of just heating it on warm to let it blend boil it for a minute or so (soft ball on your candy thermometer) and it will turn out much better.",
