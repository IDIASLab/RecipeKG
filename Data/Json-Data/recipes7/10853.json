I made mini corn muffins to go with. I did not get to try this myself--they ate the whole casserole dish full. Definitely a remake. Very cheap to make for those on a budget like me.",

It's such a comforting dish and also quick cheap and easy! I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow...glad I did that it's really good! I made slight substitutions and one addition this is a great base recipe and easy to modify to your tastes or whatever you have on hand. Instead of the ketchup(which I was out of) I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic(so I left out the chopped onion) and I used a package of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the corn(which I was also out of). I usually just add corn to goulash but the mixed veggies were a hit! I also added some steak sauce while the ground beef was cooking since I always add it to any ground beef recipe it really gives beef a lot of flavor. I served the cheese at the table instead of melting it on top so people could add as much or as little as they want. It melts when you stir it in. A dollop of sour cream on top would be good too...but I was out of that too! Geez I need to go grocery shopping I'm out of everything! lol Thanks so much for the recipe it's definitely a keeper!",

I'm just in between.\" Followed Ed's recipe as written only putting it in a casserole dish in the morning then topping it w/ cheese in the oven at 350 for 40 min. when I got home from work; much easier that way. It tasted like a fancier Hamburger Helper which isn't a bad thing but my husband thought it was just awful and wouldn't eat beyond one bite. There were so many leftovers that I decided to experiment w/ freezing it (b/c my daughter loved it so much and I didn't want to feed it to her exclusively for several days following) and Blammo! It actually translated well 2 weeks later straight from the freezer to the oven. So will I make it again just for her? Chances are no but I'm glad that I tried it!",
