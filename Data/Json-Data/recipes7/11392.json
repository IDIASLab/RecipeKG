I don't have an ice cream maker so I poured it all into a freezer bag and layed it flat in the freezer. I gave it a good \"smoosh\" ever hour for a few hours to break it up.. And after supper it was ready. It sure was smooth and delicious. If I make this again I will also cut back the peanut butter a bit as I found it overpowered the Bailey's. I couldn't imagine the taste with all the sugar (my teeth hurt thinking about it) BUT if you're someone looking for an alternative.. Just omit the sugar (or add some honey) all together as it really doesn't need it. I served mine with a dark chocolate drizzle.. And I found this really complemented the peanut butter and Bailey's nicely.",
