In my defense, the instructions are not real clear  as far as what setting the stove needs to be at while you are getting it up to 244 degrees. I dropped mine down to medium heat but after 20 minutes of constant stirring it was not darkening at all so I bumped the heat up to medium-high. Bottom line is that I ended up with toffee which was my own rookie mistake I am sure. I say mistake but I was informed by the husband that he prefers toffee over caramels and that this was the best \"toffee\" he had ever had. I plan on trying this again to see if I can get it right .",
