I used Mediterranean basil because I didn't have Thai basil but everything else was as written and they were delicious! Made the filling the night before and put them together in the morning. Once I rolled them up I covered the platter they were in with damp paper towel and then plastic wrap for transport to the party.

The cucumber is great if you eat it right away. If you're making it ahead leave the cucumber out until ready to serve or the cucumber gets soggy. I do the same with the peanuts. The mint was good but now I leave it out because of personal taste. I also make it into a lettuce wrap if rice paper wrappers aren't handy. Finally and food purists will think this is terrible but I even use dried basil and dried cilantro. In the interest of economics I never use all of the fresh basil and cilantro when I buy it so it's just easier to keep dried on hand. I didn't tell guests I used dried and it still got rave reviews. If using dried just don't forget to use half the amount of fresh called for. Yum and thanks!",

I used some rotisserie chicken I had left over and since I don't care for cucumber I left those out but I'm sure the small amount wouldn't detract from the deliciousness of this fabulous creation! The flavors were bright the filling was substantial enough to make a portable meal (especially since the \"dipping sauce\" is already in the roll) and working with rice wrappers isn't difficult; just a bit time consuming (and worth the effort!). I took them to my brother's 50th b'day party and everyone snarfed them down in record time! I am now printing out the recipe to send to an aunt - she raved the loudest and requested it. These will also be going in my lunches since they're perfect for my tiffin tin and bentos.",
