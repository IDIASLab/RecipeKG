I didn t realize the applesauce I had was super chunky until I added it to the cream cheese mixture a pleasant mistake because despite beating it very well it remained slightly chunky and looked very appealing spread on the cake. The flavor of the applesauce in the frosting was wonderful the perfect compliment to the cake.",

I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup melted butter for the vegetable oil, used 1 cup sugar instead of 2 cups (applesauce adds sweetness), 2 cups whole wheat flour for 2 1/3 cups white flour, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp, only used 1 1/2 cups zucchini, and added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon. The cake is sweet enough without adding any frosting. The kids I baked this with are 2 and 4 and they love it.",
