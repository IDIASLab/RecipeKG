I used 3 Tbsp Pumpkin Pie Spice, rather than the individual spices, and used 1 cup coconut palm sugar and 1 cup confectioners sugar in place of the 3 cups white sugar. The end result was *perfect*! So moist that it almost fell apart, but not quite. (In the correct loaf pan, I didn\u2019t have 2 of the same loaf pans, so my second was a wider, shallower loaf pan, and that one did fall apart easily.) And with just 2 cups of sugar, it was plenty sweet for us. As a child, I would eat banana bread for breakfast, but with 3 cups of sugar, this would definitely be more of a dessert bread, IMO. I just need to find/develop a healthier version because my family of 5 ate 3/4 of the batch in one day!",
