I can't imagine what mayonnaise adds that makes them better, it's just oil and more egg. Perhaps it's the beating to get the mayonnaise incorporated or the gentle cooking the recipe advises. Adding mayo to scrambled eggs made me feel weirdly icky for some unexplainable reason and since I couldn't detect any benefit from it, I won't try it again. It wasn't bad, just not better.",

Instead of \"slowly melting the margarine over low heat, adding the eggs and stirring constantly until the eggs as they cook\" which tends to cause cooling of the pan and sticking..I suggest you heat up the empty pan till hot an keep the heat on high... add the margarine (or butter), swirl to melt, sizzle and coat the pan.  Then add the eggs.  Don't stir for the first 30 seconds to a minute, then quickly stir and shut off the heat.  After another 30 seconds to a minute, stir again and quickly plate.  The result will be no sticking and creamy eggs that are steaming hot but not a bit overcooked.  Then add the salt and pepper.",
