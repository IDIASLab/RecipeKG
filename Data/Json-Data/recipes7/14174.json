It's super easy to make and to memorize, and if you only use one mug, a tablespoon measure, and a spoon, you have a lot fewer dishes to do. Easy to make in under 5 minutes with minimal mess, so enjoy! And never feel bad about eating the entire thing yourself.",

I use a small whole egg I didn't pack the brown sugar and I cook it 45 seconds based on my microwave. It's best not to over cook it and eat it while it's still warm. The top seems to still be wet and makes a sort of icing. If you cut into it the middle should be done even though the top looks wet. I bake a lot so I have a variety of chocolate chips on hand. I used 2 heaping tablespoons of milk chocolate chips and 1 heaping tablespoon of a mix of dark chocolate and semi-sweet. This is a quick solution for a sudden sweet tooth or chocolate craving! Makes 1 large serving or enough for 2 to share.",
