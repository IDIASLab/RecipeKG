I replaced half of the butter with applesauce (I know that sounds random but just hear me out) and then i baked it in two eight inch round pans. I then mixed a cup of peanut butter woth a cup of powdered sugar to make a firm and sweet peanut butter filling because bananas and peanut butter are bomb together. The moisture and density was brilliant and the flavor was THE tits. I love this cake recipe! Next time i might see if i can replace all the butter with applesauce rather than half to get a slightly more dense cake but that might effect the banana-nog flavor of the cake. I would add a photo of it but i frosted some foul language in cursive on the cake because i knew my friend would like that.",

I didn't have any eggnog so I had to make my own. I added spiced rum to the eggnog. I also had four bananas that I needed to get rid of so I probably put closer to 2 cups of banana. For the frosting I did not have any powdered sugar so I made my own frosting with 1/3c. butter 3/4c. brown sugar 8 oz. cream cheese a splash of rum and some almond extract. The finished product was a dense moist rich cake with great flavors (sweetness banana spice cream)and a very light whipped frosting...this was absolutely AMAZING!",
