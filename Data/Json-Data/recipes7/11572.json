I would say heating mango with the sugar and water is a step that could be skipped to avoid the cobbler being too liquidy and taking longer to bake. A recommendation is add some more mango after the cobbler is out. Mangoes lose their flavor when baked so adding some fresh mangoes would enhance the taste",
