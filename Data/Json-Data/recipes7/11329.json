I haven't tried it with a 100% sub, but you could try it.\n\nIncrease Juice to 2T and reduce water. You can even increase it to 3T and add no water if you want it really lemony.\n\nIf you have less lemons, you could add a 1/4 -1/2 t of zest of the lemon you are using.\n\nLimes can be subbed for Lemons.Even oranges can be subbed but fresh juice doesn't seem to work-you'll have to use  a tetra pack.\n\nIf you're using a flax seed or chia seed egg to replace the egg  you can taste the batter and add more juice and zest as you see fit.\n\nAdd 1/8 tsp. of baking soda. it reacts with lemon to give a rise.\n\nYou can split it among two cups for more even 'baking'.\n\nYou can add 2T banana for 2T oil to reduce fat and reduce sugar to 3T. This does depend upon your own taste or lack thereof for bananas.\nYou can make a 3T sub as well but banana does make it denser so you might want to keep that in mind.Maybe increase the soda or baking powder by 1/4t ?",

If, however, you are looking for an individual, easy-to-make, from-the-microwave cake, this is an excellent recipe.  I topped mine with some lemon yogurt instead of the suggested topping, but it was good without any topping at all.",
