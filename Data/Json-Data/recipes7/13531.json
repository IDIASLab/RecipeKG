The grave had the right flavor, the meat was tender and tasty.... My husband and i were over full.. I applaud the author of this recipe.. It is one of my favs...

The recipe is perfect as is as previously stated. I doubled the recipe for 5 1/2 lbs of oxtails but rain out of marinade, and mixed another single batch. So I recommend tripling for 5 1/2 to 6 lbs. was skeptical about the cayenne at first because I didn't want it too hot, but could stand to use another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon (or more if u want it spicy). Regardless, the flavor was still good and better the  next day. I imagine marinading for at least a couple hrs prior to cooking would be the icing on this already perfect start! Thanks so much!",

(Tip) add Jerk marinade vacuum seal oxtail 2-3 hours or overnight.

I've had some pretty good ones at Jamaican restaurants, but because they are so expensive, I wanted to make my own. Wow!  I am so glad I did. I marinated mine overnight in all the ingredients except the bay leaf and broth.. i used about 2 tbs browning sauce because I like mine dark. I also added a couple tablespoons ketchup to the marinade, put the mixture in a large glass bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, and refrigerated it overnight. I removed them from the marinade and cooked them in the oil for a while with the veggies they were marinated in. I discarded any liquid left in the bowl. Afterward, I added the broth and bay leaf and cooked them for about 3 hours until they were fall-off-the-bone tender. I will definitely make these again and again.",

Add 1&1/2  tablespoons of cornstarch to a 1/2 cup of water and add to pot. This will give you a better gravy. For more flavor: add 1 cup of red wine and 1 Teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.
