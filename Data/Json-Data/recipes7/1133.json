I wanted to get 12 muffins instead of 8 so I increased the cornmeal to 1 cup substituted buttermilk for the soy milk 2 whole eggs and increased the vegetable oil to 1 cup - still a tad dry but I like them that way. I used fresh fennel - about 2 Tbl - from the Farmer's Market (why I tried this recipe in the first place) and added fresh rosemary and basil - 1 Tbl. each - plus the dried thyme. I think you could use any herbs you wanted or had on hand. I also used whole wheat flour for all-purpose and local raw honey for the sugar. These muffins just get better and better every day and are good cold warm on their own or with a meal.",
