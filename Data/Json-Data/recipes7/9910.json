I froze them in smaller containers because I plan to put the jam on kolaches. Thank you!",

I definitely used the little food processor or chopper to chop my figs. Also, there was not a packet of liquid CERTO pectin to be found in the store.  ?? I ended up purchasing the powdered sister-product to CERTO - Sure-Jell.  When I mixed in the sugar and the Sure-Jell, I also found that the sugar was not dissolving and mixing in well. I put it on a low heat until the sugar was dissolved and it made a thick jam. I reduce the sugar to approximately 3 to 3 1/2 cups as I definitely didn\u2019t want it too sweet. At first taste it\u2019s a bit too much lemon so I\u2019m hoping that will meld together as it cools and sits for a bit and that the sugar will continue to dissolve well.  It\u2019s nice and thick, the way jam should be. Also not icky sweet. I am using this on an authentic Italian bruschetta with brie, prosciutto, and arugula, so you want a bit of sweetness, but, not overpowering. I\u2019m excited to try it I did put it on a cracker with some laughing cow Swiss cheese and it was delicious! ?? ????? ? i\u2019m super excited to share it with our friends this weekend and hear what they have to say. You can see my picture it perfectly filled four of the small canning glass jars!",
