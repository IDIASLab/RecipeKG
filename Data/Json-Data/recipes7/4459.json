This may be too sweet for some people but I think the bread would still be delicious without the chips if you're worried about that.  Oh, and I just baked it all in one large loaf pan for about 60 min, no idea why the recipe calls for two.  And I always use brown sugar in sweet breads instead of white.  UPDATE: I used all whole wheat flour (in pictures posted) and it was just as good & helps balance the sweetness. UPDATE: Made this into muffins and baked for around 18 min. They were great, & much easier to freeze for individual servings.  It made about 20 muffins I think.  I also don't mash the banana too much, I break it up & throw it in my mixer after creaming the butter & sugar and the mixer does the work.  These are sooo easy when using my mixer, just make sure to only mix the flour in until just combined & not over-mix.",

Also I'm not sure if they are supposed to be this way but my loaves turned out only about an inch high which makes for really small slices. Next time I will try putting all the batter in one loaf pan and cook longer 50 - 60 minutes. You are right it is addicting my daughter can't stop eating it!",
