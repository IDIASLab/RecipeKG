First I sauteed onions with about 2 cups of sliced mushrooms until very soft then I spread the onion mushroom mixture onto the crust and baked it at 400F for about 20min until the crust turned brown.  Then I tore about 1 1/2 cups of arugula leaves into pieces leaving out the stems and spread it on top of the onions and mushrooms then I topped that with about 1/2 a cup of shredded parmesan cheese and about 1/4 of a cup of pine nuts. I put it back in the oven for 5 min until the cheese melted.  It was delicious!!",

I'm going to make it again with one of the 3 extra pizza crusts that I have in the freezer (see Parmesan Pizza Dough recipe)to serve in thin strips to guests as an appetizer with a glass of wine.. Be sure to toast the pine nuts in a 350 oven for 10 to 15 minutes to give them a nice crunch and flavor.:)",

It's a good go-to recipe when you want something fast and haven't been shopping in a week. I have had a recipe some what like it in France and in Italy. In France it's usually with anchovies and in Italy with what ever meat or sausage you might have on hand. Cheese can vary from Swiss Fontina Parmesan I've even had it with Feta. I keep a 2 quart jar of pre-mixed flour mix for flat bread so it is a very quick fix. The flatbread give the base of the \"bread\" a crispier base which makes this recipe a winner!",
