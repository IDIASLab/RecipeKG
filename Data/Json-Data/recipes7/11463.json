Also, I have read many of these reviews and noticed that people were adjusting the amounts of vinegar and other ingredients.  When this is done, the acidity of the salsa is changed and this makes it unsafe to process with the recipe's instructions.  Never alter the acidity of a recipe and process it with canning.  This can cause botulism and food spoilage which can either kill or seriously harm people.  I have a degree in food science and know what I am saying is true.",
