Cooked the onion and leeks till soft, added the carrots, 2 chopped celery stalks and cooked for about ten minutes. Added about a third of a cup of flour to make a roux, let cook for about a minute, stirring constantly. Added the chicken broth, and ham. Brought to a simmer. Added about a 1 1/2 tsp dried crushed rosemary and about 1 1/2 tsp dried thyme. Let simmer for about 15 minutes while I diced the potatoes. Added potatoes and let simmer for about  1/2 hour. Used a potato masher in the pot to mash some of the potatoes to bring it to the consistency I was looking for. Added one cup of cream. Served garnished with chopped scallions and cheddar cheese, fresh ground pepper, along with hot sourdough bread and a nice red wine. \nThis was fabulous!! Such a big pot, great for planned overs!! Timing note: Preparation took me an hour and a half. Lots of peeling and chopping, but it was well worth it. I did add another 2 Cups of Chicken broth towards the end. I think next time I might add a cup or 2 of frozen peas towards the end of the cooking time for a little color.",

The only thing I modified (besides using a little less of most of the veggies and bacon than the recipe called for, but only because I didn't have on hand as much as the recipe called for) was to follow the other's advice for cutting down on the rosemary.  I use crushed rosemary, and two teaspoons was plenty...still had the flavor, but it wasn't overpowering at all.  I had enough to feed five of us tonight, and froze the other half for another cold night when I don't have time to cook.  This is a keeper!",

I used fresh about 2 tsp and it was great. I enjoy the taste and smell of rosemary. Some don't like it too strong. Use some of your sense and use to the strength you prefer. I might even use more next time. This recipe makes enough to freeze some or to serve to a large party. This chowder was so very delicious and rich not a light soup. I will use this recipe over and over. I thought it had a nice velvety thickness though it was a little thinner than chowder. If I wanted to thicken I'd try mashed potatoes or a little flour. It's great the next day the leeks/onions seem like a lot but they work beautifully. I also used my homemade turkey stock as a base. I'm passing this one along.",
