Those can be changed to suit your own tastes. Use butterscotch peanut butter or milk chocolate chips for a different taste. I usually use pecans but almonds and walnuts are great too. Make your life easier by lining the pan with aluminum foil. Let the bars cool after baking then just lift them out.",

It is very sweet. Thanks for the recipe",
