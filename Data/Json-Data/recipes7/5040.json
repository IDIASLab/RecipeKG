I too used chipotle in adobo sauce and had some jalapeno's canned in vinegar so just used the vinegar from the jar in place of the jalapeno and vinegar (already hot)! I originally misread the directions and left this on this stove for about 1/2 a day or so and it ended up really thick. Excellent for BBQ sauce. We BBQ'd prawns and my son-in-law from Hawaii dipped his prawns and then ate the rest with his fingers! He couldn't get enough. My plums are starting to get ripe again this year and I already have requests for jars of this sauce! It is great! I too did not make enough because I definitely did not end up with any left over for me.",

I stewed the plums for 5-10 minutes and them put them through my juicing sieve squeezing out the juice and pulp and leaving the skin and seeds behind. No need to use the liquid smoke the chipotle pepper is enough. Before placing the sauce in jars I used 1/4 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix this well to disolve the cornstarch then add to the heated sauce to thicken. YUM!",

I can imagine the task of pressing each of those raw through a colander to get juice. I also wanted to make as many jars as possible to can for Christmas gifts. I had to do some math for the conversions that I hope will be helpful to someone else. There are 6 to 8 regular size plums in 1 pound. For my Italian plums, there are 11 to 12. That means 44 plums to 1 quart. For this recipe, that would be 220 small plums. I simply cut them in half to remove the pit and then put them in my food processor. I buzzed 10 at a time and got them as smooth as possible. I repeated this until I had used all the plums and in total, I got 25 cups of. Fruit. You would get 33 cups if you had the 5 quarts the recipe calls for. I increased the vinegar and added a quarter cup of pectin just to make sure that this would can and keep well. I also read reviews about it being a too sweet and knew the vinegar would both help at preserve it and tone down the sweetness. I processed half pints in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and got 32 jars! Already served it with roast pork and then tacos and everyone loved it. I will share pictures and the full ingredients are used: 25 cups pur\u00e9ed plums. 1/4 cup pectin. 4 cups apple cider vinegar. 6 cups sugar. 6 cloves garlic. 2 1/2 Tbs salt. 1 large onion. 1 jalape\u00f1o. 1/4 cup chipotle peppers in adobo. Cooked everything down for an hour and a half at a simmer before canning.",
