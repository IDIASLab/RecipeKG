Half way through I stirred it and when I came back to the kitchen it has sputtered milk onto the counter. I am going to assume that was because I didn't put the lid on just right. It was quick and easy to make and not overly sweet. I just added a little milk to my bowl and didn't measure it. It is good plain too. I still though prefer the creamier stove top rice pudding that has eggs also added. However this was still a fine treat.",
