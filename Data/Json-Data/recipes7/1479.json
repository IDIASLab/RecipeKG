It seems like it had too much of a chocolate taste (not bad, but just not what I think of when I think of red velvet).  Most recipes usually call for a couple tbsp so this one is a lot more.\n\nthis is the cream cheese frosting that I used for the cake:\n\n1/2c. of unsalted butter (softened)\n2- 8oz. packs of cream cheese (softened)\n3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar\n1 tbsp of vanilla extract.\n\nAfter tweaking, I find that this is the best frosting for me.  Not too sweet... just sweet enough.  enjoy!    ",

It is a light and fluffy cake; some red velvet cakes are much more dense, but if you prefer a spongier cupcake, this one is for you. I overfilled the cups and many rose too high (although they made yummy muffin tops) - filling your cup half full makes a cake even with the paper edge.\n\nLike another reviewer, I made Janni's Cream Cheese Frosting II.  This red velvet cupcake recipe made 60 mini cupcakes and Janni's frosting covered them all with two cups more to spare.",
