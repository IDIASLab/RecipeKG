Usually this is sold as something like \"Salty Pepper Chicken\" or \"Fried Chicken is Spicy Salt\".  Also, from the reading that I've done, generally you're not supposed to eat the peppers, they're for flavor and presentation.  As for Szechuan pepper, I've had a hard time finding it.  I finally bought some from Amazon and it makes a noticeable difference.  On the other hand, the Chinese restaurants where I live don't seem to use actual Szechuan pepper either, so it isn't absolutely critical.",

Gave it the kick, but we ended up pushing most of them to the side of the plate, because their texture left something to be desired.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms, just because we had them around.  My husband picked this recipe, looking for something spicy.  We both enjoyed it! Our daughter asked me to make it in a few months on her birthday. I know it called for Szechuan peppercorns, but I couldn't find them after trying three differant stores, so we went ahead and did without. I added fresh ground pepper and still liked it. Will make again...and will be on the look out for the right peppercorns next time we're near the city. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper.",
