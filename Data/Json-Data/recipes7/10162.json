I'll explain how to prevent that.\n\nInstead of mixing all the ingredients together at the same time, what you should do is beat the eggs to an even consistency in a mixing bowl, then add in the sugar, mixing well.\n\nThen, heat the milk and vanilla in a pan over low to medium heat just until it starts to simmer. (I also added a splash of Grand Marnier but this is optional) Turn off the heat.\n\nAdd a little bit of milk (~2 tbsp at a time) to the eggs, mixing very well before adding the next dose of milk. Do this with about half the milk, and then add the rest of the milk in all at once and stir well. What this does is heat-proofs the eggs, so it'll prevent them from turning into scrambled eggs and you'll have a creamy consistency at the end of all this.\n\nAfter that, add your salt, stir, and then pour into your baking dish, sprinkle with nutmeg, put in the water-pan, and cook at 325 F for an hour, or until nice and set!",

It could probably use more eggs yet -- probably double the recipe's recommendation.  \n\nI made a triple batch on both occasions.  I didn't set it in water -- just put the whole batch in a casserole dish and baked at 300 degrees for a longer time (no fuss, no muss).  \n\nAlso, both batches came out too sweet for my taste.  I reduced the sugar by 25% in the 2nd iteration and still found it too sweet.  May need to reduce sugar by 50% to make it even less sweet.\n\nI like to have this for breakfast with some fruit compote (simmered cherries, raspberries and blueberries with canned mandarins), which I make ahead in big batches too.  \n\nI like the protein it provides, especially if I can find the right sugar ratio, so it's not a carb overload  first thing in the morning.",
