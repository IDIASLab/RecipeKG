I made these this morning as a double batch and they turned out great - they weren't super fluffy but definitely not \"flat\". If you had an issue with flat cakes make sure that you are JUST BARELY blending the dry into the wet - lumps are okay! Also I realized half way through cooking them that I completely forgot to add the melted butter that was still sitting in my microwave and they were still really good without it - so if you want to cut some calories you can omit the butter. I did add it for the second half of the batch and the butter actually made them less fluffy and there was not a significant taste change. Definitely adding this to the rotation for my lactose intolerant son!",
