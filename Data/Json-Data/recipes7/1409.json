Although I'm big on changing up recipes, this one is perfect -- only thing I did different was marinating the chicken breasts for around 3 hours prior to cooking.  There were some reviewers talking about how the marinade/sauce was too bitter and vinegary.  If you think this, you are using the WRONG vinegar!  Good balsamic is not overly vinegary.  Yes, it's more expensive than the alternative, but it's completely worth it for recipes like this.  I doubled the sauce/marinade and reduced it more after the chicken was done cooking and spooned some of it over the chicken.  My friends loved the sauce so much that they spooned some of the extra over their vegetables!  Everyone raved about this dish and one friend even begged me to give her cooking lessons!  Delicious, impressive, and simple.  Who could ask for more??",

I didn't use as a marinade because I didn't have time so I quadrupled the sauce mix (I added very finely minced onions and peppers)and then boiled it to reduce it and use. I pan fried chicken breasts (bone in) with salt and pepper and then when they were done poured in the reduced sauce. I let it boil and bubble for about 10 mins. OMG my whole family loves it. Fantastic.....",
