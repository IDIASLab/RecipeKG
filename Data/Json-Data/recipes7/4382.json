Made ab. 40 crepes, 30 of which i cooked on 1 side, wrapped into them pre-cooked foods like chicken, sausages, and spinach/cheese filling, and fried again. These were wrapped into a money-purse shape. the other 10 crepes i fried on both sides and rolled fried bananas and fresh cherries into them, then broiled them and served w whipped cream, chocolate syrup and nuts. here are my observations on this recipe, i.e., on the batter and the making of the pancakes.  1. the mixing instuctions did not work fo me.  flour and egg create dry, had lumps that are very difficult to get rid of in the batter. in my 2nd batch i followed the conventional method by beating the egg first with milk then mixing the rest of ingredients in.  2. dont need to use this much oil. you can half the oil in this recipe and still not have any sticking to the pan so why add those calories.  3. the just- cooked crepes do not stick together even when fried just on one side so no need to bother with wax or parchment paper. much time saved.  still i prefer this recipe over the eggier-tasting french crepes so i do recomend it and will use again.",
