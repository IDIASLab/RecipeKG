I just dumped all the ingredients in a big plastic bag and marinated the salmon 6 hours and it was SOOOO delicious!!!  very fresh, rich tasting.  I added the juice of 2 limes instead of lemon and added about 2 tsps of chili pepper.  I used regular balsamic instead of white and it still all came out fabulous!  I grilled mine in a pan and cooked the remaining marinade in a small sauce pan until it boiled and added a little cornstarch to thicken it- truly made the dish!",

Simply mix with seasoned bread crumbs, beaten egg, diced onion, green peppers, spices & brown in the skillet. Excellent!",
