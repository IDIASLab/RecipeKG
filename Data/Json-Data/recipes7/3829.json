That's to keep them from turning grey which after you add all the red stuff--they won't look grey. So skip that. I reduced my amount of oil and V-8 (spicy variety) til the total amount for this recipe was 1/3c. of liquid (not 1/2 c. as recipe would have it). Spray your pan with Pam and spray the tops of your taters with Pam--both times. Don't skip the step where you flip them that is ESSENTIAL in oven fries. You haven't got to flip them precisely but you DO need to move them around on the sheet or else they'll cook unevenly and any shot you had at crispness is gone. I also reduced the cayenne pepper and left out the salt (the V-8 has plenty for me.) Thanks for a keeper!",

I skipped the 10 min water soak (which would remove some surface starch) and then put them in my convection/microwave oven on fast bake. After 15 minutes I put them under the broiler to brown them up... for about 5 minutes then stirred them up (they weren't in a single layer cause there were too many for the pan) and broiled 5 minutes longer. They never got crispy which is not a big surprise with a liquid seasoning but they were HUGE on flavor and DH commented several times: \"wow these fries are killer!!\" I served them with the Green Chili Chicken Sandwiches from this site and it was a fine meal! Next time I will make them the long way to compare results. Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Since the fries never got crisp even under the broiler I decided to try something different: I mixed up the dry ingredients deep fried the potatoes (twice to make them crisp) and then sprinkled the dry ingredients over the potatoes and mixed to distribute the spices evenly. With a 1/4 C. oil added to the original mixture I can't imagine that frying them would use much more if any than that. My deep fryer is very good and the oil is 375 which allows little oil to be absorbed or cling to the fries. We liked this version even better.",

Usually fries in the oven are too mushy for me so I cut the potatoes very thin (about 1/4\" thick strips) and they crisped up very nicely. Also add 1 tsp. of paprika to the mix and it will really help tie in all the flavors. Great submission.",
