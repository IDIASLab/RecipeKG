It makes about 24 large muffins or 6 muffins and a loaf. Even though they last well in the refrigerator, you may want to halve the recipe for individuals or small families. Add some cream cheese frosting and they'd make great cupcakes.",

I make a lot of pumpkin breads and muffins and chose this recipe because it was a little different, as it calls for twice the amount of pumpkin to flour as other, similar, recipes.  Plus, it called for half whole wheat flour, which I don\u2019t often use.  I\u2019d call them the ideal breakfast muffin as they are light, fluffy, and only lightly sweet and spiced.   In addition to great, breakfast-y taste they were beautifully risen and nicely domed.   I prepared the recipe just as written \u2013 and it needs no changes.",

I cut the sugar back to one cup and used half white and half brown sugar. I also opted for milk vs. water and added a generous tsp. of vanilla along with a handful of raisins I had on hand. This is a great base for add-in's such as dried cranberries, raisins, nuts, or chocolate chips. Before popping them into the oven I topped them off with some turbinado sugar for a little extra crunch. These baked up beautifully and were perfect with a piping hot cup of tea!",

Hands down, just wonderful. Followed the recipe almost to the letter, but i used all whole wheat flour and all brown sugar (all i had on hand), added about a tsp. of cloves (because I am a clove addict ), and I added a bunch of pecans - 'cause you can't  go wrong with pecans - and they were amazing! Moist and flavorful and perfectly  sweet. I had cream cheese icing on hand but I decided I prefer them without - they are so sweet and moist they need no further accoutrements. \nAlso found it this batter makes a fabulous cake with no changes needed - it was late and I was tired and so after getting 17 hefty muffins out of the recipe I threw the rest of the batter in a small, greased cake pan and baked it until a toothpick  came out clean (I didn't  time it - maybe 40 minutes?), and the result was an amazing cake that I took to work for my girls. It was gone in minutes, with rave reviews.\nSeriously,  there is a pumpkin bread recipe on this site that has like, 2,000 positive reviews and is in the hall of fame - it cannot hold a candle to this, not even close. Thank you, PChicki  - I will never, ever waste my time on any other pumpkin  muffin/cake recipe again - let all other chefs be on notice to throw in the towel;  this is THE ONE!\nA thousand  stars sister, well done!",

From what I've read from the other reviews you don't need to make any changes but based on personal preferences and circumstance I made the following adjustments: I only had all purpose flour so that's what I used. I used half brown sugar half white as a personal preference. I added in raisins to half my batch (I love raisins but my boyfriend isn't a fan). I had intended to use pumpkin pie filling but it turns out that I only had pumpkin pie puree. I made up for the difference by adding an extra 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I got 27 large muffins out of this recipe which I turned into 27 kickass cupcakes with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site. I dusted them with a little cinnamon sugar that I had fine ground with my coffee grinder. LOVE THESE! They are so moist so tasty so darned good! I got rave reviews. They taste even better the next day. They were SUPER simple to make and 30 minutes at 350 degrees gave perfectly risen pumpkin flavored bites of heaven. I would post pictures but they're all gone:)",
