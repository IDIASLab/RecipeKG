I would check them at 45 minutes to see if the vegetables are ready to eat. I didn't have any fresh thyme, so I sprinkled dried thyme on the veggies. The roasted vegetables were so colorful and everyone enjoyed them. This is a good way to get your kids to eat vegetables. My 6 year old granddaughter and my husband ate the squash without the usual what is that?  My family liked everything except the green apple. The green apple was a bit mushy. Next time, I will add a Honey Crisp apple and watch the baking time. I am thinking the apple would take about 15-20 minutes of baking.",
