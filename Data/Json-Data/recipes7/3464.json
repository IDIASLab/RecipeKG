Once you take that first sip you get exactly what you were signaled to expect - a rich but refreshing creamy pastel-colored not too sweet drink that reminds you of a chaise lounge pool and sunshine. I used Splenda rather than sugar and half-and-half rather than cream but beyond that stuck to the recipe. I generally make Hubs his preferred yogurt-based smoothies but for me today this was a refreshing and welcome change. Normally I might garnish this like a Pina Colada - a wedge of pineapple perhaps a maraschino cherry and a paper umbrella of course but this time we just slurped this up straight out of the blender the two of us cleaning up this \"4-serving\" recipe in no time. Loved it.",
