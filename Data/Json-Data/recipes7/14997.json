I added a little bit of cake flour to compensate for the fact that you can\u2019t buy 18-oz cake mixes anymore (at least I don\u2019t see them), but otherwise followed the recipe.  This is one delicious, moist, and flavorful coffee cake, loaded with pumpkin flavor.  I seldom use cake mixes anymore, but I bought one for this recipe, and I\u2019ll keep one on hand, just for this recipe, I think some chopped pecans or walnuts might be a good addition to the cake batter for an occasional variation.  Well done Morgan, this one\u2019s a keeper.",

Both of my kids loved it. i made it just as described but the recipe called for 18 oz cake mix. All I saw was 15.? oz so that's what I used. Otherwise kept all amounts the same. Perfect and amazing!

My only note of change on this recipe would be 1) timing/bake time and 2)glaze amount. I baked it as recommended and it was still jiggly, loose, and came out with batter on the stick. I ended up having to bake this for much longer than the 25-30 mins suggested, more like an hour. It still came out moist and delicious. Additionally, I would recommend doubling the recipe for the glaze and having some extra to serve on the side with each slice. It's just that good. Best served warmed and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Can't beat this yummy fall treat!",
