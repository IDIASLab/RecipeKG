Second go round I didn't wait for the bubbles on the sugar I just cooked it until it was a beautiful clear amber color; pulled it off the burner and quickly poured it into the ramekins then continued to follow the recipe to the letter. Well except that I served the flan warm. I couldn't bear to wait yet another four hours. Success! The flan has a wonderful flavor and terrific mouth feel--even warm. Another fabulous recipe from Chef John!",
