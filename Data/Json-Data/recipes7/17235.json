I agree to cut back on the milk (I used unsweetened almond milk) and I recommend using homemade bread for this because it s hardier and I had no issues with sogginess because of it. So this recipe works well using homemade bread (and for a hardier break I recommend wheat bread flour). My french toast turned out perfectly tender but crispy and the raisin bread element really made it better. So thank you as someone with an intolerance to eggs and dairy I am very excited to be able to make french toast when I want it.",
