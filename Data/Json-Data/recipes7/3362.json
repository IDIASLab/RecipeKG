This was the perfect balance of sweet and tart but also really fresh. My husband even loved it. He said the fresh basil reminded him of when his mom would add fresh mint to iced tea when he was a kid. A new summer staple for us! Oh and we also dont usually like gin. We've got two bottles left from our wedding 3 years ago and havent used a drop. Thanks for a wonderful way to use it up that we really love!",
