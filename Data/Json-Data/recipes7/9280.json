                "reviewBody": "First thing's first: I altered this recipe. I didn't use regular all-purpose flour because I didn't have it on-hand. Instead I used whole wheat flour. Since it's more dense I figured I'd use less for the crust. I ended up using nearly 4 cups before I got a workable dough. The dough itself doesn't really seem like a dough at all- just butter and flour. I didn't have a pie tin either- I used a jumbo-cupcake tin and made six small cheesecakes instead. It worked out fine. For the topping I used Michigan apples and only 1 tablespoon of cinnamon (I love cinnamon just misread the recipe). I ended up having so many apple slices left over I could have made another six cheesecakes. I would recommend getting an apple slicer or having a buddy to help you slice the apples that process took me about an hour in itself (I also did everything by hand- coring slicing etc. and I made the slices super thin). I didn't peel the apples but I partially wish I did for aesthetic purposes/I'm not a fan of the skin. If I were to make this again I'd also make a streusel and really make it more like an apple pie. Next time I'm definitely looking for regular flour. The crust came out bland and tough. Also perhaps longer cooking time or more time to cool (I rushed and dug into it before it was completely cool) as it fell apart completely and the filling didn't seem entirely done. Otherwise it was delicious. I'm definitely making it again- I have to I have so many apples left over!",
