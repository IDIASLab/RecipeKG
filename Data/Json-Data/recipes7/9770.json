Thank you for the recipe- my neighbor gave me a bag of fresnos and I had no idea what to do with them-- now I have a better understanding!:)",

Changes I've made are as follows: -after trying it the first time I now leave out the anchovies. Just didn't like the fishy taste that is noticeable when scraping out the left over juices from the pan lol. -I add in Italian sausage to balance out the meal (love my protein). To fit the circle theme I boil them on their own first cut them into circles and throw em in to the sauce. -I couldn't find Fresno chile pepper so I used a really hot jalape\u00f1o...next time using less because it was almost too hot to handle. -I just used tomatoes for the tomato component. Whatever I have on hand is what I use (fresh diced canned whole canned or crushed canned) because I don't like pre made sauces. Five star recipe people!!",
