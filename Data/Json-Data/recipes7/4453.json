I didn't have any oranges to zest, so I used lemons instead.   I first checked for doneness at 35 minutes and found that the muffin-sized cakes were overcooked and dried out, and my larger cake was right on.  The cake didn't taste like any mamon I've had before, but that's likely because I used lemon instead of orange peels. I thought the muffin-sized cakes were dry and probably won't make that size again. Having said that, the resulting lemon cake from the larger pan was absolutely delicious and won rave reviews from friends even three days after baking. It stayed moist and flavorful (those bits of fresh peel burst into every bite.   I frosted the cake with an airy, light buttercream, and the results were fantastic. I'm not a huge lemon cake fan, but I will make this again and again. And I'll be trying it with orange peel in the very near future.",

I believe using cake flour next time and folding in the egg whites a little at a time gradually along with the flour (instead of mixing it in with the egg yolks) will create a more delicate cake. I cut the recipe in half and was able to make 2- 6\" rounds...baked in my Wilton aluminum pans at 325 degrees for 30 mins. They puffed up beautifully. The only change I made was instead of the 1/3 cup of water and oj I used 2/3 cup of milk and omitted the grated orange peel because I don't care for citrus flavored cakes and pastries.",
