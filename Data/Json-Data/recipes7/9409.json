After browning 2 sliced chicken breasts I added two very heaping tablespoons of seasoning with maybe 1/4 cup water and finished cooking the chicken while the sauce reduced, then I added back in previously sauted green pepper, red pepper and onion and finally a tomato at the very end. Delish! This is a keeper, and if you like the idea of making your own mixes, I highly suggest checking out Bill Enchols' Taco Seasoning I from this site. Now I'm all set, no more packets!",

In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards I omitted the cayenne which was no hardship as far as I'm concerned.  I just substituted some fresh ground pepper. I used this for the seasoning called for in Spicy Beef Fajitas, also from this site.  Having now eaten the dish I used this seasoning for, I have no more doubts about it...and only wish I would not have listened to Hubs and made more than the amount of fajitas he insisted was plenty for us.",

If you want an even bolder flavor, toast cumin and coriander seeds in a skillet until the aromas are released and then grind them up in a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle. That toasted spice really kicks this into another level. All in all, the original recipe is also good on it's own.",
