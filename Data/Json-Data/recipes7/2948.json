Since the recipe didn't say \"dice/chop very very fine\" I think that before the beaten eggs are added the soup should be blended. It would also be helpful to have better instruction than \"fill a large pot 3/4 full with water.\" I used my 5 1/2 quart Le Creuset pot and filled it 3/4 full. By the time I added the 4 large potatoes it was full to the brim. Since potatoes greatly vary in size a weight would be helpful. We picked the sorrel from our community herb garden--as other reviewers have said it's hard to find sorrel in stores (including our local co-op). It would be nice to know how much a \"bunch\" of sorrel is.",

I filled a large soup pot about 60% of the way with water (which I salted) and that was perfect because it left enough room for vegetables and stirring without issue. My grandmother's recipe also calls for 1/2 cup of white rice to be added into the water with the potatoes which I'll add next time. Also I bought a package of prewashed spinach which made the prep easier since washing each leaf can take a lot of time (a 5oz package yielded about 4 cups of chopped spinach which was just right). Someone else suggested blending the soup I would not this is not intended to be a cream soup. I was generous with the salt added an extra tablespoon of sugar and served with sour cream. This recipe was close to my grandmother's so I'll try it again and review once I've added sorrel.",

Also I think white balsamic vinegar would make the most sense here but I used apple cider vinegar. I was worried the red balsamic would change the color of the soup too much. Lastly I tripled the sugar and the vinegar because this made a lot of borscht. Very good! And we used all of the listed garnishes. I would make this again.",
