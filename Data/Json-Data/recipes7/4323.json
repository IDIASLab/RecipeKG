The blueberries cut the tart/bitterness factor perfectly without overpowering the cranberry flavor. Genius! My only criticism would be that it was a little runnier than I would have preferred. Maybe it's because I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (the grocery store didn't have fresh the day I needed them) or maybe I simmered too long? Not long enough? Regardless this will be the cranberry relish I make from now on.",

I, like the other viewers thought that it was alittle runny so I added 1 Tabls. cornstarch. I still thought it was too runny so I added another 1 Tbls. of cornstarch. This helped thicken it a bit more. This dish can be used in so many different ways. I think it would be good poured over cream cheese served with crackers. I will keep this recipe and it will be a star at every Thanksgiving from now on. Thank you for the great recipe. It is even going in the recipe box of cherished recipes from my granmother.",
