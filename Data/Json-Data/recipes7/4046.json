The combination of fruit is awesome and not overly sweet. The shortcakes are light and fluffy - I cut the salt down to 1 tsp. added 1/2 cup of flaked coconut 1/2 tsp. of lime juice and used butter instead of shortening. You definitely need a well floured surface to cut these out on as the dough is very soft. After I cut out the shortcakes I topped them with a bit of turbinado sugar and placed them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I let them set for about 30 minutes in order to the the baking powder \"react\". They baked up beautifully! For the whipped cream I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream with 2 Tbsp. of white sugar and 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract. Be sure your bowl and beater are well chilled and it'll whip up nicely. I can't remember when I've had a more unique or refreshing dessert. Thanks larkspur for a great recipe!",

The gelatin part of the coconut cream is optional; it is just intended to help stabilize the cream if it has to sit for a long period of time. If you decide to put the gelatin in be careful that it doesn't cool down too much as it will form small hard lumps in the cream when you try to beat it in. I hope this helps! Thanks for looking at my recipe!",

I did use the real buttermilk called for as I believe it adds to the richness of the shortcakes. The dough was unbelieveably soft and pillowy. I just knew they were going to bake up nicely and they did. We just loved the coconut cream and the flavors in this recipe are a match made in heaven. The only thing I would change next time is reducing the salt in the shortcakes. It was also a very quick and simple dessert to put together. It looks involved at first glance but it's not at all. Wonderful! I can't wait to make this again.",

Instead I used the heavy whipping cream and confectioners sugar (powdered sugar) I also added about 1-2 tablespoon shredded coconut to it! Turned out great. I also didnt have buttermilk for the bread dough part but a good substitute (I didnt want to run to the store) is fill almost 1 cup of milk add 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice and let set for 5 minutes and then use this as you would in the recipe. I also added 1 extra tablespoon honey. It worked out great!! Thanks for sharing this recipe Larkspur hopefully I did not make to many changes:)",

These were still great but I could see how the lime would make them even better. Like others I did not use the gelatin in the whipped cream and it turned out great. I really loved the coconut flavor in this. As for the shortcakes I used butter instead of shortening and I did not have poppy seeds but those were the only changes I made. They turned out fantastic.
