It bakes up great with a nice crispness to the outside of the dough. We felt it is wonderful the night it is baked and ok the following night. We had a alot of strawberries to use so I made a full recipe. I would make them again with the intentions of eating them all the night they are baked or down sizing the recipe for the number of shortcakes needed.",

I modified the recipe slightly (1 1/2 tsp vinegar 1% milk in lieu of buttermilk and a little bit of half-and-half plus some 1% milk in lieu of 2% milk) but I don't think the modifications were responsible for the problem. The recipe says to roll or pat the dough into rounds but mine was a very runny batter. I put globs of batter on a cookie sheet and baked it anyway. The baking time was correct but the shortcakes came out as flat disks. They tasted okay but didn't have the look I was going for.",
