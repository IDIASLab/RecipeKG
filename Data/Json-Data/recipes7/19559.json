The picture is of a loaf of bread however I followed the recipe as written and it did not make a dough but a thin liquid that was very thin, like a crepe batter, not even cake batter. So before my bread machine began baking, I took it out and added more flour until it was break-like dough. But this recipe is just 'off'. It does not make a bread dough. Shame, I was looking forward to trying pandan. I ordered the pandan paste especially for this recipe. Will look for a new recipe. I do appreciate this recipe though as I had never heard of Pandan before.",
