I followed reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 cup less sugar, more cherries, added a tsp of Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice blend, and a tsp of vanilla.  I also used half white sugar and half Sugar in the Raw, because I like its richness in baked goods.  I made one-and-a-half of the recipe for the cobbler part because I like mine with lots of the good stuff.  I used a cherry pitter, so from start to finish the prep time took less than 20 minutes.  The finished product is fantastic.  The taste and texture of the cakey part of the cobbler is just sublime.  This is the one to try if you're looking for a good cobbler recipe!!",

I picked up a pail of Door County Wisconsin cherries while on vacation and have made this four times  (for myself and to share with others)  I did add one additional cup of cherries.  It's almost like \"magic\" how the cobbler forms!\n\nSomeone at work gave me a tip on how to pit cherries--use a drinking straw.  Just hold the cherry flat on a plate, push the straw into the cherry, then pull the cherry up over the straw.  The pit remains on the end of the straw.  It worked great--(much better than my $10 cherry pitter.)\n\nThanks for sharing this great recipe!",

For the batter I got away with using 1/2 cup of sugar vs. a whole cup and like others I added a bit of cinnamon. I used buttermilk vs. milk and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. While I poured the batter into the 9x13 dish I kept thinking, \"Is this really going to be enough?\" and while it spread thin, in the end it was plenty. I doubled the amount of fresh cherries and even though my hands looked like something out of a horror flick it was worth it. I just might have to try this with fresh peaches or blueberries. I tossed the cherries with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. This baked up beautifully in 55 minutes! I sprinkled the top with a bit of powdered sugar and served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream  - YUMMY!",
