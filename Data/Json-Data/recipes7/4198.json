Fantastic Results!  They were a big hit at the dinner party...although, needed to whip up a second batch half-way through the dinner party...everyone wanted more!  Hint for preparing ... put stuffing ingredients in a small ziploc bag (sandwich size).  Nip a small corner off the bottom and squeeze the stuffing into the egg whites!",

It seemed to overpower the other ingredients.         REVISION: 5 stars when I halved the amount of red onion and grated it like another reviewer suggested. I have made this recipe 3 times since my original review and found that using quality real bacon bits tastes as good as the pan-fried bacon and takes a lot less time.",

One suggestion I have is to grate the onion instead of mincing.  Makes it much easier, and you don't have to worry about accidentally biting into a too large chunk of onion.  Thanks for the recipe!!!  Something extra:  Today I turned this recipe into egg salad because my husband had bought some baconnaise and these eggs popped into my mind.  Super good!  Just added about a tablespoon of dijon to it.",

I managed to eat two halves but the bacon turned too chewy in the mayo and the deviled eggs filling itself was way too sweet. I thought it seemed strange putting sugar with balsamic vinegar and it didn't get any better with refrigeration. I'm sorry but I didn't like these at all and was disappointed that I hadn't stuck with the traditional recipe with mayo mustard and egg yolks. My husband and kids all disliked them.",
