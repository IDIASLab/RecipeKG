I used a bag of dried mango/pineapple/papaya that i had left over from something else in place of just the mango and i did not use dried cranberries. They were really good.

I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the shortening -- texture was perfect -- and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup (next time, I might reduce the brown sugar instead, to 1/2 cup, since I feel like a mango cookie should be a little lighter-colored than these turned out).  Also doubled the mango, and left out the nuts and cranberries; next time I might add even more mango, since the bites that didn't have any were not terribly interesting.  Finally, like other reviewers, I had to bake for 15-16 minutes, even though my cookies were small enough that I got about 4.5 dozen out of the batch.",
