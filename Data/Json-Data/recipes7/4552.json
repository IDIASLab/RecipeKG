The only change I made, substituted dry milk powder with vanilla instant puding mix, and since I think there is no need for aditional 1/2 cup of flour  in the filling, I added 1/2 cup milk. Next time will add a little bit more for a more creamy consistency. Will certanly make again. Thank You.",

The coconut filling was so tasty and my kids and I had fun learning how to work with a fresh coconut - btw one coconut yeilds enough coconut to double this recipe. When I mixed the filling it was very crumbly rather than creamy so I added a tiny bit of milk to cream it up. Note that the filling does not end up gooey like an eclair - it's drier - and oh so good!",

There is only one thing that's missing and that's salt. It is a bit bland without adding salt. Maybe it was accidentally forgotten in the original recipe.",

The buns were hard after sitting for several hours.  This time though the dough did not deflate when I put on the egg wash.  Anyone else have problems with the filling?  Mine comes out still all crumbly and flaky.  The recipe shows says makes 32 buns, but the recipe says it makes 16?  I made 16, and I think there was so much of the filling that there was at least 1/4 cup of filling (if not more) in each, and still had a little left over.  This was my 2nd attempt at this recipe.  Although I gave it 4 star (for benefit of the doubt), I don't know if I would make this again.",
