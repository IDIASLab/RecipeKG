I started down that road because the instructions said to add the rice at two different points. I figured the second time was the right one. I also noticed there was no salt listed (the bouillon I used didn't add a salt taste at all for me).so I went off on a tangent.The spice mix was very nice for this soup but I added salt Cajun seasoning and red pepper. I added about 12 cups of water (I felt 8 was not enough for all the spices added!) used dried celery leaf instead of the celery used a tiny bit of red curry paste instead of the curry powder.. I used the two legs and two wings from our turkey. I diced my onions didn t want them in big pieces since everything else was in small pieces! I brought to a boil and simmered for 30 minutes. Then I took out the turkey and removed the meat and returned the meat to the pot. I then added 1 quart of buttermilk (instead of the half and half) one cup of our leftover mashed potatoes and one small can mushroom pieces (drained)..and brought to a simmer and maintained on low for 30 minutes. I then added 1 cup Minute Rice and cup Egg Bow pasta and simmered for 20 minutes. Came out wonderful! Oh also even though it s common sense the recipe should mention to remove the bay leaves before serving! I do love the combination of the spices so don t shy from this recipe just needed a few tweaks for me!!!!",

Instead of using boullion cubes I replaced the water with a combination of turkey and vegetable broth. I made this recipe originally post Thanksgiving and had a number of items on hand. Also I used one cup heavy whipping cream to avoid going to market instead of half and half- this made for a heavier hearty soup more like stew but delicious! Great recipe heavier or lighter.",

The only thing is that I was hoping with the amount of half and half that the soup would be a bit creamier/thicker maybe more like a chowder. I used a flour/water thickener which was okay but found that after cooling in the fridge the soup turned too thick into a gel. Upon heating on the stove the soup thinned out back to where it was. I will be posting a photo soon as well. If you want a thick soup this is not it but it's a thin creamy/brothy soup with alot of flavor!",
