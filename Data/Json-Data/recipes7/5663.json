I doubled the sugar as I like a sweeter shortcake and I reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I added a little more egg and cut back on the butter. Since I wasn't sure how \"whipped cream\" would turn out so I used buttermilk instead and enough to get the dough workable. I let wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and let it chill for a half hour. I then rolled it out onto a well floured surface and cut it with heart shaped cookie cutters before putting it into the oven. I also did an egg wash and topped the heart-shaped shortcakes with a bit of turbinado sugar for a little extra crunch. They baked up beautifully and tasted great with the strawberries and whipped cream. A wonderful summertime treat and a great way to use fresh strawberries!",

I worked with what I had - I lined the bottom of muffin pans with parchment paper baked at 300 for 25 minutes and as soon as they came out of the oven I made an indent in each one forming a sort of cup. They did not stick to the pan at all and they are delicious.",
