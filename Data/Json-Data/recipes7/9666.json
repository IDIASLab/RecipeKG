I have no doubt this recipe tastes good, from looking at the ingredients...BUT BE CAREFUL with this recipe. The USDA recommends using ONLY PRESSURE CANNING when preserving soups and they advice against using thickeners, such as flour, because the product will not heat evenly or thoroughly for safe processing. If you want to use this recipe, I suggest you leave out the butter and flour, then process quart jars in a pressure canner for 20 minutes @ 10 lbs. Make a roux, using flour and butter,  and then add to the processed soup when you are ready to serve it. I'm not trying to be difficult...I love canning, but don't want anyone to get sick from not processing their food properly.",
