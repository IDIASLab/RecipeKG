Used 1T butter instead of olive oil (not as healthy, but added A LOT more flavor and made the caramelization process more accurate).  Instead of plopping everything into the pan together, I melted the butter, added both sugars and heated on medium-high till the sugars just barely started to caramelize.  Then added the seeds and toasted, stirring regularly till they started to brown slightly and pop (about 5-min depending on temp under the pan).  Added the coated seeds to a pan with the sugar/spice mixture and voila!  Yummy, yummy!  Even my fianc\u00e9e, who doesn't like pumpkin seeds, likes these!",

I added my own variations like a tsp of garlic salt instead of just plain salt when toasting and I added extra cinnamon in place of the ginger and extra cayenne pepper and these turned out great.
