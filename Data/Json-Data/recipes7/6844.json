I remember the regular version from when I was a kid but didn't compare. These haven't set up yet but they did seem a tad oily and softer than I remember. I made 1/2 recipe which yielded 20 cookies with a cookie scoop. I followed the recipe except when I cut it in half I subbed 2 of the tablespoons of sugar with maple syrup for a little added flavor. I used Jiff creamy natural instead of chunky. I didn't think coconut would be good in these nor remember it so I left it out. The filling still seemed plenty thick. I also added a small pinch of salt. 20 cookies made as written above came to 89.2 calories each.",
