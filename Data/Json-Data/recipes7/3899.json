I used brown sugar instead of white in the sauce. Because I don't keep cornflakes on hand I used a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I didn't need the full amount a half cup was plenty. I did not add sugar to the meatballs because there was sugar in the sauce. I also used homemade italian seasoning in the meatballs. The meatballs held up well but weren't my favorite. The sauce was pretty good and complimented the meatballs well. I liked that recipe baked the meatballs seperately so I could pour the grease off before adding them to the sauce. I think from now on I'll use a mixture of the beef pork and veal because that made for a great meatball. I liked the nutmeg too. It was different in a meat sauce but tasty. I don't think I'd add as much next time I think 1/4 of a teaspoon would be just right.",
