Here is what I do differently: I rub shredded cabbage with garlic salt in a large pot and then pour boiling water over the cabbage covering completely. Boil the mixture until soft usually around 15 min. Take the pot off the heat drain the cabbage and return it to the pot add spices.5 to 1 spoon of butter(I use Smart Balance butter or other butter made with olive oil) and the eggs. Also after pinching the end together I turn piroshok so that the pinched ends are on the bottom rather than on the side. It helps to keep not-so-well-pinched pirozhkis closed during baking and creates a nice symmetric shape.:) After placing the pirozhki on the baking sheet I let the dough rise just a little. Right before baking I brush them with beaten egg yolk for glowing smooth look when ready. Yumm!",

I also fry onions in olive oil until they are golden and sometimes a little bit burnt and add them to mashed potatoes if you use the oil from frying the onions then you really dont need to add milk or butter whem mashing the potatoes. Another filling is sour cherries i don't think anyone mentioned that from what i know the traditional fillings for pirozhki that you can buy at a russian store is meat potatoes cabbage or cherries sometimes i'll also add 18% fat cottage cheese with a little of my favorite (or whatever i have in the pantry) jam inside.",

I scanned a lot of websites including some in Russian and I changed the recipe a little bit according what I found and I used food processor for making the dough: I used 2 eggs reduced milk to 1 and 3/4 cups and used 1.5 packages of active dry yeast. I put 5 cups of flour to the food processor added salt run it for a couple of seconds (I use dough blade and speed) added butter and run it again for a couple of seconds. I dissolved yeast in the milk with sugar after 10 min I added two eggs slightly bitten to the yeast mixture. Turned on my food processor and slowly added the yeast mixture let it run for a minute and slowly added about 1/2 cups of flour (as much as needed to form elastic and non sticky dough). I let it raise around 1.5 hours and made pirozhki I let the pirozhki to rise for 20-25 min brushed with egg and baked them for 20 min on 400F... These turned out great - soft and fluffy... Be sure not to make the dough too thin. I'm sure that the original recipe is also good but I changed it according to the \"Russian sources\". Good luck - pirozhki is a great food especially shared with friends:)",
