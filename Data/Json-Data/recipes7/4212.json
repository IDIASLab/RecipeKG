Cardamom adds an unusual and subtle perfume to these preserves.  Though this recipe does take some time to complete, the majority of the cooking time is hands-off.  The best part?  You will not need to purchase pectin from the store! Adjust the sugar content to your liking, erring on the side of less sweet, as the jam will cook down considerably.",

After I added the butter and sugar to the mixture I only cooked the jam about an hour more (low simmer). My yield was about 9 half pints. I also processed them in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes (I live at high altitude-- about 4600 feet) Thanks for the recipe!",

These plums had a a fairly free stone so I pitted them before beginning. Because of the long process time and so many things happening I pitted the plums the night before and refrigerated them in water with a splash of lemon juice. I used that as cooking liquid the next day. I did add a little ground allspice in the second cooking. It smelled heavenly. Since this was my first attempt I am not sure if this added a lot but the flavor is so good. I will make this again! Update! I took this into work today with some English muffins and a few cheeses. I also took in a jar of my apricot jam. This was gone in short order. It is a little tart and a little spicy. This is going to be a part of my party package gift packages.",

I did put in 2 cinnamon sticks about a teaspoon of ground cardamom and a Tablespoon of lemon juice. Update: I learned a cool method of pitting and peeling but jam is too tart and didn't firm up stayed a syrup. Fruit also had a burnt flavor because it cooked so long. Will be a perfect cobbler filling.",
