I cut back on the sugar less than a 1/4 cup. I taste it as I go. The apples definitely give it some sour goodness. Some pear might be good as well. It definitely will be better the next day as the vinegar breaks it down. Serving this with some chicken on the grille. I am trying to eat healthier as I age. So this has some great good health sense to it. Enjoy!",
