I halved the cake portion of the recipe replacing the nuts for mini chocolate chips (for the kids) and baked it in an 11x7 baking pan so it came out a bit thicker more like a cake but it was perfect for us. I do wish that just for the sake of knowing the size pan would've been indicated. I did use the full recipe of the frosting which was also delicious. Loved the hint of cinnamon in this too! This was so simple to make and came together in minutes...this recipe is a definite keeper YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
