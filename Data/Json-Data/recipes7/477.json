I added 2 more cups of all purpose flour and that still wasn't enough but I was tired and swollen and cranky (95 degree weather while 8 months pregnant will do that) so I said oh well and threw it on the pan in the best loaf shape i could get it and figured it was a lost cause. If you are going to put the dough in a 9x5 loaf pan...or 9x7 or what ever size the 9 inch loaf pan is it will make 2 loafs instead of 1. Anyway will make this again but will make sure I add more flour.",
