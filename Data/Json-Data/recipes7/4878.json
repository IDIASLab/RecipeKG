I didn't really believe it, but I tried it out and then proceeded to alter it to suit my own tastes because I thought it was too heavy and the texture was a bit wonky - if decent for an instant chocolate fix at 12:00 in the morning.  Still, the unpleasant texture just became more pronounced as I experimented with vanilla variations.  At last, here is my 5-minute lemon-poppy seed cake that rises beautifully and is light and airy - unlike the chocolate cake.",

I've reduced the cook time to 2 minutes with little success. The inside just wants to change colors to an unappetizing burnt brown and is very chewy. Flavor wise the cake is great especially when topped with lemon glaze.",

I put a little glaze on top of powdered sugar skim milk and lemon extract. Thanks for a great idea and I'll buy some poppyseeds for sure to make this again.",

I reduced the sugar to a bit over half but then ended up sprinkling it on top. Not as lemony since I used lemon juice. The milk/vinegar substitute for buttermilk seemed to work doesn't take long. Used a bit more poppy seeds and ground them for more flavour. If I'd thought of it wonder if soaking them in milk like in some other poppy seed recipes would have improved it? Also I used whole wheat flour. For a microwaved cake I was impressed.",
