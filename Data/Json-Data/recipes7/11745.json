It totally makes them amazing, you do end up using about a cup more flour, but they were so good everyone keeps asking me to make more, more  and more!!! I also instead of glazing them when still slightly warm shake them in a bag of regular white sugar and lot's of cinnamon. My husbands first comment was These are better than my Mom's !! Since we are all Vermonters and cider is one of our greatest joys as well as fall apples. These I would recommend to anyone whom love apples and donuts because you will be in Heaven once you have had these. \nThanks , Angie \n\nFrom the middle of Vermont",

Make sure you reduce the cider to 1/4 cup (measure it!) and use real apple cider (not juice or cider from concentrate) for best flavor.",
