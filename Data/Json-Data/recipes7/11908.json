I also added some sliced fresh strawberries which gave it a nice contrast to the dijon mustard and the maple syrup. Definitely a keeper with the mods. I also took a suggestion from the other comments and massaged the kale before adding the squash mixture. Made it very tender.",

I did cut back the 1 cup of maple syrup down to just a drizzle (maybe 1-2 tablespoons at most). I can't help but think that the 1 cup is an error as the squash would have been swimming in syrup had I used the full 1 cup. I ended up doubling the vinaigrette because after making it as the recipe stated it just didn't look like enough to coat the salad and I'm glad I did. I would also slice the red onion a little thicker next time as some of them burned before the squash was roasted. With these changes this is a 5 star recipe and one that I look forward to making again.",

For the dressing I added fresh squeezed lemon olive oil & substituted maple syrup with honey since I don't care for maple syrup. I finished it with salt and pepper to taste. I tossed the spinach and kale mix I had with the dressing first and once the butternut squash cooled a bit I tossed it in with Feta instead of parmesan. Don't toss the sake til right before serving for best results.",
