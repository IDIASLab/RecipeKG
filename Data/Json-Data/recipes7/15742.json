I did use King Arthur Flour's cinnamon chips which are smaller than the Hershey's but kept it to the same amount called for. These are very good and knowing my \"audience \" they won't last more than one afternoon. I got 15 cookies following all the directions. The filling is not equal to a double-stuft if that's what you are wanting but I did make mine 1 1/2 teaspoon which was enough I thought. Thanks for the cookies! I hope they make it until the rest of my family comes over tomorrow!:) EDIT: Having just tasted a cookie the next day after my taste buds have settled I can tell you that you need not make more filling because they are sweet enough with the recipe as written! YUM!",
