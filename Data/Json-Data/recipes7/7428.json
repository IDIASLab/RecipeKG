I did chill the mix overnight then put it in the ice cream freezer. The freezer recommended 20 to 30 minutes in the freezer and I found it needed to run closer to the 30 minutes' time. The only thing I recommend against is combining the ingredients in the freezer bowl because when it's frozen the ingredients will start to freeze before they are fully combined. I agree with a previous reviewer: this ice cream is outstanding even without the PB cups added in.",

I mixed all of the ingredients (used reg. peanut butter) in a bowl to make sure they combined well. I had a hard time getting the peanut butter to fully incorporate but it was mixed through enough. This ice cream was so creamy and had great flavor (the peanut butter flavor really came through). I used mini Reeses cups (the real small ones) that I just cut in 1/2. I would've liked this just as much w/o the pb cups added to be honest...the ice cream is that flavorful on it's own w/o the additions but it was wonderful w/ them too! This was just too simple... I would def make this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
