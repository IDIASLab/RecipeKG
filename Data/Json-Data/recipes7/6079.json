My standard is cinnimon all spice nutmeg ginger and crushed red pepper for heat. Just put in with grounds and brew. Very nice!

I brewed half a pot of coffee. The smell of this brewing is amazing--almost like combining chai and coffee. I did use Truvia to sweeten the drink instead of granulated sugar. Not bad. Next time I would skip the nonfat milk powder and sweetener and use fat free vanilla creamer. Nice twist on your everyday cup of coffee.",
