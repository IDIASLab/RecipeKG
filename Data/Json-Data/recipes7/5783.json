The cream cheese icing was incredible - I didn't put as much icing sugar as the recipe called for but everyone raved about it!\nMy only problem was after the cakes were baked, they were very brown on the outside (about a 1/8\" inward) and the centres were the bright red.\nI made the cakes again, but unstead of mixing the food colouring with the cocoa powder to make a paste, I mixed it into the buttermilk with the vanilla and vinegar.  I put the cocoa powder (which I sifted) in with the flour mixture.  It was still a little browner on the outside, but not nearly as much as before.\nI would make this recipe again!",
