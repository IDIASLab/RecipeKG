All the guys said,  'Gosh, I didn't know anyone knew how to use a Dutch oven anymore!' I told them they were my guinea pigs because this was my first attempt with fresh peaches instead of canned. I don't think I can go back now; it was perfect, especially served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A little extra work but I can't wait to make it again.",
