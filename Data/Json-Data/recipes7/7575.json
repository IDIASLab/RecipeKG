I got a little distracted and forgot to turn the oven off after an hour, so they baked at 225 degrees for close to 90 minutes.  I thought I had ruined them so I didn't wait for them to cool with the oven door closed.  They were nicely toasted and tasted like crisp, airy toasted marshmellows.  Next time I will set the timer and try to do it correctly!!!  Kudos!",
