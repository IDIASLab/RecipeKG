I made a 2 layer round chocolate cake (my ALL TIME FAV that never needs icing from Hershey's - HERSHEY'S \"PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE\" Chocolate Cake) and this barely made enough to go between the layers and around the cake once assembled. I will be sure to double next time! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!",
