I followed the recipe exactly along with the Grand Marnier Anglaise Ssauce (which I made the evening before). I do recommend watching Chef John's video to get a good feel for how long to cook the flour and butter and how far to whip the egg yolks at various stages. Not only is the video very helpful, he's quite entertaining. After cooking as directed, I quickly sprinkled powdered sugar on the souffle before serving and then let each guest spoon the Grand Marnier Anglaise Sauce into the top of their souffle. I prepared as much as I could before my guests arrived -- had everything measured everything out, zested, separated eggs. They were amazed and duly impressed. Exquisite dessert!",

Yes, you have to eat it right out of the oven or it will deflate.  I doubled the souffl\u00e9 recipe to make 4.  Likewise I had 7oz ramekins, so I filled it to the top.  Looked just like the pictures in the video and tasted fabulous.  It was surprisingly easy to make.\n  There were three of us, the picture ( I accidentally added the picture twice, it's the lone souffl\u00e9 in the blue ramekin on the tinfoil covered baking pan on the stove) is the extra one which we quickly devoured. The other three were better looking, but the extra was darn near perfect too.  I did cheat and used an electric hand mixer on the egg whites.",
