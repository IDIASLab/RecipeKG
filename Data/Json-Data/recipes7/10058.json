I used a greased 8x8 pan and baked it about 40 minutes. I have celiac disease so I used 6 slices of canyon bakehouse gf bread instead of 5. (Gluten free bread slices run small) I also added an extra egg since gluten free baking does best with more egg too. I kept everything else the same ingredient-wise but I did mix the butter in with everything instead of pouring on top. It was on the sweet side but not too sweet for me or my friend and her family. It would still have been good with a quarter cup less sugar and maybe a touch more pineapple. I may try those changes the next go round. I will definitely be making this again!",

Its super easy to make. and mmmm mmmmm so so good. Its kind of like a pineapple bread pudding. So so very good. Will definitely make it again. Easy tasty and cheap. Cant get better than that.",

Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream just cause I love that rich flavor. Then after baking for 30min at 350 degrees I broiled it to caramelize the crust and it came out so good! It tasted like a pineapple cobbler! It really doesnt look appetizing but I found some of the best tasting foods look gross lol But ill definitely make it again. Ill probably try some more variations on it to make it look more appetizing but even if I can't make it look more appealing Im still gonna continue to make it! Thank you for this recipe!",
