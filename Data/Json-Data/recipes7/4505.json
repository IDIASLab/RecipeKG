The translation from Italian is actually \"Venus' Nipples.\" If you've ever seen the movie \"Amadeus \" Salieri offers them to Mozart's wife and she giggles because the name is so naughty - but I digress. These are the real deal authentic taste. The puree of chestnut adds a unique depth characteristic of these gems. It's true that they're time consuming but incredibly worth it. I have to point out that the recipe submitter said \"high quality\" chocolate and that cannot be stressed enough. Your product will only taste as good as the chocolate you use. I used Lindt which made for an incredibly delicious treat. Take the time to temper the white chocolate as described - it's spot on. If you melt it slowly it will retain its lovely sheen which gives your product high appeal. Kudos for this one!!",

Try to use fresh chestnuts if they are available. It gives the truffles a richer taste. For variety add finely chopped toasted almonds or freshly grated nutmeg to the truffle mixture.
