                "reviewBody": "The reason I didn't give this five stars is not because of the taste they were really great once I got it right! I tried it five times! I made a recipe very similar to this one only with a pound of confectioner's sugar and a tablespoon of butter at the end rather than just one and a half cups of the powdered sugar. Here are my tips: if your icing is too thin add more powdered sugar and if it is too thick add as much hot water as you need. I had to constantly water it as it thickened up very quickly. I used a piping bag to pour over the sides of the cake just to make sure they were covered before using a medium-sized spoon to pour icing over the top and get a nice smooth surface. I was only happy with the way it covered the cake the last time I made it it was not too thin and not too thick from the beginning though I still had to add water from time to time. Maybe it had something to do with me doubling the recipe since I only did it that last time? I had enough to cover about thirty 2x2 petit fours which is a great size especially if they are layered. In any case these were beautiful and got AMAZING reviews from the people at the wedding shower that I made them for. If you re looking for an idea I used Betty Crocker French Vanilla and Golden Vanilla cakes doctored with about a teaspoon of almond flavoring apiece. I also filled the middle with a buttercream icing that I had folded cherry preserves (run through the blender) into as the shower was cherry-themed.",

                "reviewBody": "I ended up making 2 batches of this frosting (which I would actually label as an \"icing\" since it is so thin) because I figured one batch for 48 servings would be enough for 36 1.5\" x 1.5\" petit fours. The first batch was way too thick and I had to keep adding warm water to thin it out. When I ran out of the first batch I made the second by substituting 1/2 Cup of unsweetened cocoa powder for the powdered sugar. It turned out just perfect: thin enough to drizzle but thick enough to give nice coverage. I tried two different methods for icing: by tube and by dipping -- both used a LOT of icing. The icing cooled down and thickened up too fast in the tube. Dipping was faster and easier but very messy.",
