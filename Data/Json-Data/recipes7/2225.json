I did use butter instead of margarine so not sure if that had a lot to do with it. The almonds have natural oil so I think I would cut down on the butter next time. Mine also flattened out a lot more than at least the pictured ones this is I'm sure due to the butter. They are not cake-like at all but more like a chocolate chip cookie consistency--a little crunchy and a little chewy. This was good and I would definitely make again.",
