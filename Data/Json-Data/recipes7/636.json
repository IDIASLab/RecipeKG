He said that he didn't like most American desserts because they are too sweet but he thought this was perfect. So that tells you that it is not a rich dessert if that's what you're looking for. I just used plain white bread like the recipe called for but perhaps using the Hawaiian bread that a previous reviewer used would give it a little extra sweetness. I personally love sweet rich desserts so I probably would not make this again for myself but I'm giving it 5 stars on behalf of my friends from Kenya. And it's so quick and easy to make that I give it 5 stars in that department. One more note--I could not find cardomom in the grocery store so I substituted a combination of cinnamon and ginger.",

My mother-in-law is German and a fantastic cook. I made this and brought it over to her for her to taste. I carried it in set it down on the counter and went out to my car to get something else. When I returned to the house I caught her with spoon in hand already eating the mango bread pudding right out of the baking dish. I laughed and she remarked how tasty it was. She just about ate the whole thing. Next time I make it I will make sure that I pour the egg cardomon mixture onto the bread/mangoes immediately after mixing the cardomon in. I didnt the first time and the cardomon had all settled to the bottom of the mixture and consequently it was all concentrated in the same area of the baking dish. This recipe is a winner in my book!",

The only thing I changed was to reduce the cardamom to 1 tsp for fear of it being overpowering and I thought that amount was perfect. I also really urge people not to replace the cardamom with another spice- it gives such an amazing flavor to the mango. I made this in ramekins and topped them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- delicious and looked pretty too!",

I had 3 WW kaiser rolls that needed to be used so I used those I had two small mangoes & one large so I used all three & I added a little more sugar. My eggs were very large so I just added a bit more milk to compensate for the additional bread. On the test bite I thought it might need a sauce to accompany it but then I couldn't stay out of it while I was cooking dinner so evidently not. LOL The first thing my hubby said to me this morning was to say again how good the bread pudding was so I guess it's a winner in his book too.",
