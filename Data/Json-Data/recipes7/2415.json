You should also add the fish/oyster sauce at this point before adding the other ingredients or it won't absorb evenly into the food - you'll probably get some bites that taste fishy.  I also halved the oyster and fish sauce since the smell was...well..terrifying.  With that amount it added perfectly to the flavor but wasn't a noticeable/dominant taste at all (no one would know it is in there).  It's important to use fresh garlic.  I also prefer to chop the chicken after slicing (or use ground chicken) so it absorbs more of the flavor.\n\nThe hardest thing about this recipe is finding the Thai basil (different from Italian), I found it in an Asian market.  You can substitute stir fry or wide rice noodles for the rice if you prefer.  If you use wide rice noodles, it's best to chop them up a bit so they absorb the flavor.  \n\nWonderful recipe - I'm so excited I found it!  This will be a weekly recipe in my house!",

Here are my recommended changes: 1) Use 4 to 8 Thai \"bird's eye\" chili peppers instead of serranos. 2) Add the bell pepper when the chicken and onion are nearly done cooking so it won't overcook. 3) You can change the flavor of this dish a lot depending on when you add the fish/oyster sauce. Add it before the chicken and it will lose most of its characteristic Thai flavor. Add it a couple minutes after the chicken and you will keep some of the fishy Thai flavor. Or, add it with the rice as instructed here and you retain a lot of the fishy flavor!",

I personally use five chilis but I like it REALLY hot so normal people may want to use 2 or 3. I also cut the oil in half added 1/4 tsp of salt and added sliced shitake mushrooms. Awesome!",

I cook this in my giant propane outdoor wok that I bought from Bass Pro Outlets...cooking on it is quite a show for friends! I prep all the veggies in advance so when I'm ready I just throw everything in (in specific order of course!) I've made the following changes to an already outstanding recipe: I add more sauce (9 tablespoons oyster sauce 6 tablespoons fish sauce and 3 teaspoon white sugar). I add 2 chunks of finely chopped ginger with the garlic. I also add sliced carrots mushrooms and diced scallions. I scramble 6 eggs in advance and add them at the end. I occasionally substitute scallops or tofu for chicken. WOW this is great!! Everyone I've made this for wants the recipe!! (I can't figure out how to give this 10 stars so I'll have to give it only 5!)",
