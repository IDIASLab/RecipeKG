Whether you call them smoothies or milkshakes whether they have yogurt or they don t no matter what fruit is added to them he loves em. Me? I really could take em or leave em as I ve never tasted one good enough to warrant all the calories and sugar even if that sugar is just from the fruit. Besides after making them awhile one began to taste pretty much the same as another anyway. Not this time. While I had plenty of berries on hand both fresh and frozen I was determined to find something different to try and this was it. Frozen mango came in handy and because of that and the fact there was already quite a lot of milk in the drink I chose not to add the optional ice cream. I added the cinnamon but didn t want to push it and take a chance with the nutmeg so I left it out. I handed this creamy frothy milkshake to Hubs then tried a little myself and thought wow this is awesome good! Uniquely different and 5-stars for sure! And even tho I didn t expect Hubs would agree he did! So what was so different about this? It wasn t thick and gloppy it was refreshingly light. It wasn t overly condensed with flavor again refreshing. It didn t have the sour tang of yogurt. Most of all it wasn t your same old tired berry smoothie. If I had any criticism at all it would be that I might have liked a little more mango but that would just be overly picky.",
