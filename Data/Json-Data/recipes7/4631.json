I made them a second time, cooking the ribs as I usually do, wrapped in foil at 275 for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Also the second time I made them my oldest sons friend was over, he's a 5 star restaurant manager and a trained chef, he suggested that I put the sauce in sauce pan on the stove bring in to a boil then put it on simmer and let it reduce until it was thicker. then I coated the ribs in the reduced sauce and broiled them for a few minutes until they browned up, you could also toss them on the grill. That made this 10 stars!!!!",
