But I noticed another reviewer served it iced so I will check that out tomorrow with the other serving. This would especially be good in the cold wintertime. I was expecting the ginger to be really noticeable but no one flavor overpowered any other. 5/4/2016 I made 2 servings last night and drank 1 of them hot. Today I poured the rest of it over ice. It is much better ice cold! I really enjoyed it after my walk around the block outside.",
