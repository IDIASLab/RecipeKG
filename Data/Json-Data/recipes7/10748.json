This recipe ensures that all the 'Puffins' are done at once. You can add a plethora of mix-ins like fresh fruit or a staple in our house Reese's Pieces&reg;. These are really good with a side of maple syrup, or even melted butter; however, plain is good too. I really like them without the mix-ins and peanut butter on top.",
