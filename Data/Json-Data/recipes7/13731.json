One recommendation I would make is to NOT add the beets to the bowl with the beans and dressing (they make the beans turn pink and it doesn't look as appetizing). Instead just toss the beans with the dressing place the beets on top of the arugula and then pour the beans and dressing over then top with the blue cheese and walnuts. Beautiful!",

I think next time I might up the blue cheese a bit and use candied pecans rather than walnuts but that's just personal preference. I will DEFINITELY not mix the beans dressing and beets next time- it turns all of it a funky pink color. Instead I'll just use the beans and beets separately on the salad and drizzle the whole thing with the dressing. All in all a great recipe!",
