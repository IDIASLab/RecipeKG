Here's what I did: I only had clementines, so I used those in the blender. I zested just a sprinkling of the peel into the bowl. The batter was runnyish in the end, so I added about 3 additional tablespoons of flour, to make it closer to a typical cake batter. For the sugar, I used half white, half brown. I used the called for oil. I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. And I used the called for salt. I also added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon. I poured the batter in a glass dish sprayed with cooking spray. Then I sliced one Fuji apple thinly, tossed it in cinnamon sugar and put it on top. Baked it for 45 minutes or so -- just until a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean. Let it cool about 10 minutes, sliced it in squares, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and voila. It was fantastic. Whole family loved it. Totally changed it up,  I know. But figured someone might like what I did. Cheers!",

I followed the recipe and added some extra ingredients to make this cake feel a little bit customized. I ADDED  an extra orange and a kiwi to the juice, which yielded 1 3/4 cups orange-kiwi juice, also 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and i altered the sugar by using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar ( this was not intended,  i ran out of white!!). The cake baked for 45 minutes, but that is probably due to the extra liquidity of my cake. I greased the pan with butter  This cake tasted chewy but not mushy with a flavor that displayed the fruit in a tasty but not overpowering way.",

It tasted great with strawberry coulis (punnet of strawberries pur\u00e9ed with a little sugar)and banana ice cream (pur\u00e9ed frozen bananas, that's it!). The second time I substituted 1 cup of the flour for almond meal, used coconut oil, and sprinkled 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries over the top. Recipe is a keeper.",
