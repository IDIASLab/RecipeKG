Another crumb cake recipe I've used has a ratio of 3 cups dry cake mixture: 1/4 cup oil; this one is 3 cups dry cake mixture: 1 and 1/4 cups oil. Way too much oil for our tastes. (The ratio for dry ingredients to milk and to eggs is the same between the 2 recipes.) The cake was unpleasant: heavy and greasy tasting (not at all like any of the European-style cakes I've eaten; they usually have a fine crumb and almost dry texture).",
