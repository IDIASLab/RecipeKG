I love Adobo and my friend's Lola (grandmother in Tagalog) makes the BEST kind!  So luckily I had that flavor memory to go off of. This recipe yields a very vinegary Adobo when following the recipe exactly and takes longer to make than stated.  I added an extra 1/4c soy sauce, 2t sugar and 1 clove garlic to the recipe.  I let the chicken simmer, turning occasionally, for an additional two hours to soak up the new flavor of the sauce.  I just made this last night and after the adjustments it tastes pretty close to what Lola makes.  But the original recipe as it stands doesn't measure up.",
