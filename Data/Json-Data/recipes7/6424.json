As some of the other reviewers have stated there is a slightly bitter taste to the finished ice cream but.... Have you ever drank a Guinness before? You should know what you're getting yourself into.;) As for the instructions let me start off by saying making a custard correctly is quite difficult. There's a high chance that things will get screwed up. I made the recipe as followed but would suggest the following alterations. First make sure you completely separate the yolks from the whites. The whites will cook into scrambled egg consistency when finished. Not very tasty to have scrambled eggs in your ice cream. Second when you add the hot cream to the yolks (tempering) make sure you mix the out of it. When it looks well mixed mix it some more to be sure. Third the cream in the pan was too hot when I added the tempered yolks. They cooked way too fast and I ended up with stringy yolk pieces in the finished custard. I would suggest cooking 1 cup of the cream and milk together. Then before the tempered eggs were added add the one cup of room temp cream to the pan. Heat slowly over medium-low heat. The custard will be finished when the mixture has thickened like the recipe says but if you want exact it's 165 degrees. This will likely take longer than the 2-3 minutes in the recipe. Don't get the temp above this point. Fourth two hours in the fridge is likely not",
