I also agree about using a pot twice as big as needed because of the foaming after you add the b.soda.  The foam took about 30 minutes to go away after the syrup was done.  However - despite the great flavor - I could taste a slightly \"carbonated\" aftertaste of the baking soda.  I had to refrigerate this syrup and wait until the next morning to reheat it in the microwave - then this baking soda taste was gone.  I would recommend preparing this the day before you have guests over.  Otherwise it does have the flavor everyone else says it does!",

                "reviewBody": "All right, this is seriously the best syrup ever.  No more store bought ever again.  But there are a few things you should know when making it - first of all, when I first put the ingredients in the pot, the milk curdled and looked gross and it took a little while for it to set up correctly (just  a minute really, but I thought it would be faster to go from curdled looking to syrup looking and was worried that I had messed it up).  I also read the other reviews that mentioned how thin it ends up, so I took 1 tsp of cornstarch and added just enough water to make it liquid, then added it to the mix when I added the baking soda.  It was very foamy but still delicious.  My kids loved it.  I ended up eating a little later (you know, get them off to school and then get a chance to eat some waffles myself) and by that time, the syrup had cooled off, thickened up to about the same as store syrup, and lost all the frothiness. We'll see whether it will become a gel when it cools off completely - I tried to use just a little cornstarch to avoid that.  But whatever the form, frothy, syrupy or gel - this stuff is delicious. It does not taste like store bought stuff, but rather a buttery cinnamon syrup.  Much better and I didn't have to butter the waffles before the syrup because the butter was already in there!  All in all, a great recipe that will get written into my favorites recipe book.",

I let that sit for 10 minutes and then I took out 1T of mixture since the recipe only calls for 1C of buttermilk. This turned out wonderful!!! It's definetly not your typical syrup but I'm not a fan of maple flavor so this was PERFECT for me. It is runny straight from the pan so if you have time to let it sit that helps! Just delicious!

No more store bought syrup for us!  ***UPDATE*** I have made this several times now and want to let you know when adding the baking soda to the hot mixture it will bubble up a lot (do not leave it or it will boil over).  Also, we almost never have LEFTOVERS.  If you like a thicker syrup you need to let it cool. When it is hot it is very thin and can separate. It really thickens up nicely and has a beautiful caramel color.  I also make and serve mine right away but now I try and let it sit and cool for 10 minutes.  It does reheat well in the microwave  This would be GREAT used on a sundae, or as an apple dip.",
