My changes were adding 3 cloves of minced garlic along with the saut\u00e9ed veggies, 3 extra cups of chicken broth because there wasn't enough liquid for my potatoes, using fresh instead of dried thyme, and omitting the cayenne. I will definitely make again and probably use milk instead of half and half as I don't think the great taste would be compromised and maybe add some shallots as well. Thanks for a great new soup recipe!",

This is a very nice potato soup but I would recommend if you re spice-sensitive start with a little less cayenne and then add more to suit your taste. We re about middle-of-the-road on spiciness and this just was just a tad too much cayenne for us (personal taste). I used fat-free half-and-half to lighten the soup and didn t feel there was any sacrifice in flavor otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. The texture slightly thickened (perfectly) there was just a tiny bit of a crunch from the carrots and the celery (just the way we like it) and I did set aside some of the bacon for a garnish. The recipe indicates preparation time is 1 hour and 20 minutes but this will be on the table in about 35-40 minutes. Marilee Wilson Mack thanks for a really tasty new soup!",

My main difference was to make the soup in the potato pot (instead of the veggie saucepan) with just a little bit of the starchy potato water to help the soup base. For the base, this was another change: I used about 3 parts chicken broth to 2 parts half and half (with a splash of whole milk to perfect the consistency since I used a whole lot of dying veggies), which I think comes close to flipping the recipe ratios. That was mainly to be calorie conscious but also because I didn\u2019t have enough half and half! This one turned out great but I\u2019m sure you can do the base however you want.",
