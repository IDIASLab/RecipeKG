Because I don't own a food processor I used my KitchenAid mixer to make the bottom layer and it worked out just fine. I used my 7x11 baking dish so the bottom needed 30 minutes to bake instead of 20. I will possibly try baking it in a bigger dish next time. The only change I made to the bottom layer was to add just a shake of salt instead of the whole 1/4 t. I made the blueberry mixture just as it said to. I also made the top just as suggested although I'm going to add cinnamon next time. I baked them for about 25 minutes and couldn't wait until they were cool to take a bite! These would definitely be good with some ice cream or Cool Whip especially when warm! I was hesitant to bake with garbanzo beans but now I won't be anymore. Thanks for sharing your healthy recipe Janet! Edit with change to 2 stars: Turns out these blueberry squares were good only for the first day. After that they turned very soggy and inedible. I ended up throwing away over half of the recipe.",

Only real change I made was using Mazola corn oil, mostly, as I only had about 2 Tblsp left of olive oil. I like that this had a lot of fiber with the beans, rolled oats, and all of the blueberries and it used oil instead of butter or shortening. Although, I could slightly taste the garbanzo beans. They do have a distinct taste. Also, the crust starts to get soggy by the 2nd day in the fridge. So, consider that with 24 bars, even if they are on the small size. Also, with the fruit, a large pack of blueberries, or whole sales club size, is really needed to get 3 full cups unless lucky enough to have a blueberry bush with abundant berries available. I used a 12 1/2 x 8 1/2 x 2-inch disposable pan sprayed with PAM. The bars cut out very nicely, but the topping is a little lose. Freshly made it was rather tasty with a little whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.",
