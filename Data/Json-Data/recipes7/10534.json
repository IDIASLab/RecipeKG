I just know they are loaded with fat, with all the crispy ramen noodles, and tons of sugary dressing. I was on the hunt for a healthier version and found this one. I used a 10oz bag of finely shredded cabbage. For the dressing, I followed it as is but used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine as it was what I had. I tried to make the dressing with less sugar, but it was too tart. I added in the amount of sugar suggested, but then only put half of it on the cabbage mixture to reduce the sugar dressing even further. I figured the other half could be added if really needed later. Although, this one definitely has less oil and sugar to begin with than other similar recipes. I used 1/4 cup each of sliced almonds and the sunflower seeds. Both were unsalted so I added a dash of sea salt and black pepper. I left out the raisins by choice and realized after the salad was done I had forgotten the green onions. It was fine. Also, I would definitely mix in dressing before serving if a crunchy salad is desired. It will completely wilt down within an hour. The recipe does not make a ton anyhow. Made as written I got 5, side dish servings, vs. the 8, at 144 calories each. ty",
