Also, you may increase the amount of corn starch for thicker dressing, and please feel free to adjust the sugar and onion to your taste. Much of the fun of cooking is changing a recipe to make it your own. NEW EDIT: Please disregard the number of servings, this recipe easily feeds 12 people. I forgot to change it from the default when I posted the recipe. Also, \"medium\" potatoes refers to the size, not type of potato. I ALWAYS use red potatoes for potato salad. Kaye",

My mom made THE BEST homemade potato salad and I wanted it to be like hers.  Everyone in the family always requested her potato salad ALL the time.  She passed away in January and unfortunately she never got the opportunity to share her recipe with me.   I changed a few things about this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup chopped dill pickle, used green onion instead of white, and used red potato's instead of regular.  Other than that, everything was the same.(NEW EDIT: must use 2 tsp cornstarch instead of one-it makes the PERFECT consistency). This potato salad was UNBELIEVABLE!  I was THRILLED when my boyfriend and my dad said it was even better than mom's!  They said she would be so proud of me!  I bet she was in the kitchen helping me along.  =) Thank you SO much for the recipe...it's just like mom's.  I'll cherish it forever!",

I would second some of the changes that have been recommended (I replaced the onion with 3 green onion bunches, doubled the cornstarch, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and added 1 tsp of celery seed with the mayo and 5 slices of bacon with the celery. And I used half apple cider vinegar, half white vinegar.\nIt's really rich and delicious!  I love it.\nMy only original tips would be: (1) don't freak out if the dressing smells really weird while you're cooking it, that's normal and (2) if it's your first time and you're nervous about cooking the potatoes just right, make more than 6 and then while you're dicing them, choose the six with the best consistency and save the rest for mashing or something later.\n\nThanks for the great recipe!",

First off people complained that it was too \"oniony\" so I only used half a walla onion and 3 green onions. People also complained that it was too sweet so I didn't use the entire 1/2 cup sugar more like 1/3 cup maybe a tad bit more. I also used two tsp cornstarch and let it cool COMPLETELY before I added the mayo. I used 10 red potatoes instead of russet ones. I also added 4 slices cooked chopped bacon when tossing potatoes with celery and onions. I then added 1/2 cup sweet relish to the dressing before tossing with potatoes. With these modifications this potato salad is to die for! I brought it to a family party and it was gone in a flash. I got told that I was now the new potato salad maker for all get togethers:)THANX FOR THIS RECIPE!!!",

I used 9 potatoes, had to go with 3 bunches scallions (hubs won't eat raw onion), added 5 diced sweet gherkins, 1 tsp. celery seed, pepper, garlic powder and dry mustard mixed into the dressing mix. I did not use the prepared mustard. Additionally, as others have already said, you really do need to double the cornstarch.
