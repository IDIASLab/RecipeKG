                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe today for Father's Day. My Dad and the rest of the family loved it! The only reason I gave this a four star review was that directions could use some improvement and the bake time was far too long. First I would NOT recommend stirring your raspberries. Next time I make this I will combine the white sugar mix first coat the rhubarb and then add the raspberries. Secondly my food processor didn't do so well with the crumb mixture. Even though I cut the butter into smaller squares I ended up with chunks of butter dusted with \"dough\". Next time I will chop the nuts (I chose hazelnuts) first cut the butter into small cubes and then add the dry ingredients & chips. Lastly I skipped the 10 minutes bake step and only cooked it for 45 minutes. The rhubarb was VERY soft. Once it was cool enough to eat I could no longer see any raspberries and there were only a few chunks of rhubarb. Oven temperatures vary so I would recommend checking the crumble so it doesn't over cook. Overall a delicious recipe served with vanilla ice cream (just sweet enough to contrast with the tart fruit). I especially loved the chocolate!",
