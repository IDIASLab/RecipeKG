I scaled the recipe to just 2 servings, using half a can of black beans and half a can of regular yellow corn.  I eyeballed the other ingredients and just threw in what looked about right.  My scaled recipe called for 2 T. plus 2 t. of sugar, but I only used 2 t. in mine.  That was as sweet as we wanted it.  I also added just a bit of vegetable oil, which I think improved the mouth feel of this.  So, my advice is to scale way back on the sugar and add it to taste, and you have a winner here!",
