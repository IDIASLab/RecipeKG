I was a bit concerned that the muffins would be done ar the 325\u00baF temp. I typically bake muffins at 350\u00baF however these baked up perfectly at 25 minutes. Many muffin recipes can be decadently sweet and that s one thing that I liked about this recipe. You get just enough natural sweetness from the fruit the oatmeal gave the muffin a bit of a bite but they still were plenty moist and tender. I think what I m trying to say is that I felt like I was eating a tasty but healthy muffin this morning! Nice breakfast muffin sherry and my husband enjoyed them as much as I did.",
