Reserved 3 tbsp of flour and tossed about 3 cups of frozen blueberries in it (instead of cranberries). 2X recipe made 76 mini muffins. Seems like a lot of mods but this is standard for me:-)",

I made my own applesauce unsweetened from pink lady apples and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the 1/2 cup of applesauce. Much better for the sweet-tooth I am. I will make it again like this.",
