I cut the recipe in half as I thought the original would yield too much for my home. I did add diced mushrooms while saluting the onions and browned 1lb Italian seasoned ground turkey. Since mushrooms sweat (produce extra liquid) I used a full can of tomato paste. I cut down the olive oil to about 2T and used a mixture of oregano and thyme. I decided to use my slow cooker and cooked it for about an hour then took out the bay leaves, threw in the fresh basil and cheese and then put in a splash of white wine instead of the suggested amount. Slow cooked for another hour and boy, I can eat this out of the pot by itself! Thank you for sharing!",
