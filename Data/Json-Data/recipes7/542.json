I have made it 3 times, the first time I made it by the recipe but I reduced the sugar and salt by half.  I also took out the seeds and membranes of the jalapenos.  The cumin was too much and not hot enough for me.  Next time I reduce the cumin to 2 tsp and left the seeds and membranes in the jalapenos and it was perfect!  Right now have it simmering but added some chopped peaches and cut all the sugar out.  Great recipe, thanks Kim!",
