I've tried another pickled egg recipe before, and I didn't care for them, so I was definitely skeptical of these...To my surprise and delight, these were yummy! Loved the spicy kick and the flavor that the eggs had. I could totally see using these in a salad (though they are great eaten on their own). I made a jar for my dad too, so I'm curious to see what he thinks of them, and I can't wait for hubby to get home to try these... I know he's gonna love them! Thanks for sharing another GREAT recipe, Brian! :) UPDATE: My dad raved over these and hubby and the little guy absolutely LOVED them! Hubby wants me to make more and an extra batch for him to take to work for the guys...This recipe is a winner, Thanks again!",

I've tried with miserable luck that is until I tried bd's eggs at the Las Vegas Round Up! Hey I carted the leftovers home (surprised that were any left!) to California and presented them to my husband Randy. Bonanza! These were it! I've since made them many time one dozen at a time. Great for my midafternoon snack or hubbie's cocktail hour appy. I like Marianne's idea for salads sammies and deviled eggs. Well done my friend!",

Then I saw all the fuss about this recipe and it buzzed around my head for a while. Boy am I glad I listened to all the hype. I made these with a homemade pickling spice using 36 quail eggs and 1 hen egg. My picture isn't as pretty as the other but it shows you how many quail eggs will fit in the liquid. \"Refrigerate for at least two days\" it says...try making them last that long. I suggest making these and then immediately abandon the house for 48 hours only then will you let them rest as long as required. They are THAT good. Thanks to bd weld for the recipe and thanks to the other reviewers who convinced me to try these. Sometimes peer pressure is a good thing. UPDATE: 12.Dec.15- I made these to give as Christmas gifts using all organic ingredients and homemade pickled peppers. Comparing the outcome to when I made this using industrial produced peppers vinegars and herbs/spices is like comparing night and day. Amazing is all I can say. Try these using your homemade peppers and you will see I'm right!",

I couldn't wait to get home and make these for my hubby. So after I talked to bd_weld about his recipe and telling me I could easily do a dozen I did a dozen and a half. I'm finding it hysterical on my part when making the recipe I used the really hot yellow peppers with brine and a pickling mix offered from my store because it was way cheaper then buying the Morton's. Should have gone with that because little did I realize how loaded with dried whole red Serranos and thought ohh what the heck HA!! on my hubby because he said they were fantastic but...WOOO!! what a kick. I ate the yoke out of several and hmm good so I didn't get the intense heat from the egg whites themselves... he sure did. What a great addition to my household. Will look for the milder hot peppers with brine for the next time for my children. But they seemed to like them as well. TY Brian!! we love it!!!",
