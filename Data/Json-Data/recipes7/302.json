This is very close to the way my mother made the dish.  However, I find it best to chop up the raisins, capers and olives (no nuts) and mix them in.  The reason as mentioned in other reviews is that people don't like biting into an olive or caper or even a raisin.  The flavor comes through.  Also, if there is too much broth, I strain the meat mixture, put it aside, and boil down the broth separately.  Then I add the meat back into the remaining broth.  If you cook the meat in broth too long it loses flavor.",
