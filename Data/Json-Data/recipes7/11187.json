I could have made the bodies larger but they worked out great still. I ended up with a lot of extra ganache and whipped cream but that is likely because I didn't make big enough swans. I'd hardly call having extra chocolate and whipped cream in the house a problem though. Assembly was simple and in the end made for a big hit at dessert. I will do again! Also I don't have silicone mats so used parchment and had no problems at all.",

I filled them with a strawberry whipped cream\u2014I ground up about 1/2 cup freeze-dried strawberries in the food processor with the sugar, adding it when the cream was softly whipped. Next time, I might make a 1.5x batch of the pate a choux, so that I\u2019d have eight perfect swan bodies and enough for plain ol\u2019 cream puffs. The swan bodies I piped were about the size of Italian plums; they do puff up nicely. I pricked the bodies at the head end with a skewer about three-quarters of the way through the bake time so the insides would dry out somewhat. Loved these! Really quite easy, once you get the piping down. Oh, and I made the swan components the night before, and filled right before serving so they didn\u2019t get soggy.",

Two things I should have done, I think are these:\n1. mix the eggs and dough longer and 2. Lower the temperature to 350 after ten minutes for 20 more minutes. I took them out when 20 minutes passed because of the color; they looked great. I even pricked them with a toothpick (a clean one, thank you) to let the heat out, but they fell, as did my heart. But let me review the components I used:\n\nthe pate a chou was made exactly as Chef John (who I love) recommended. The filling was a simple custard package with cream and was lovely. And, the ganache was just as Chef John said. \n\nNow, I realize that no recipe will re create the joy that my hubby felt when his mom (now a celestial chef) made them for his birthday. Even if they are better, they aren't from his mom. So, to satisfy my chemistry perfectionistic compulsions and to try to create an 'almost' mom like puff, I shall try again. Hope springs eternal.",
