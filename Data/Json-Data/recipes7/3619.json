                "reviewBody": "I made a half recipe of this and I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I only made one change and that was using two packets of yeast instead of one for a double recipe. I proofed my yeast in the warm water with the sugar in my mixer bowl for ten minutes then added the butter and all the dry ingredients. The amount of flour called for was perfect there was no need to add more to get it to form a ball. I kneaded the dough with my dough hook for five minutes then set it to rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad for an hour. I then formed my rolls using a 1/3 cup dry measuring cup (this dough really rose!) and I plopped the rolls in greased muffin tins (I got exactly 12) and covered them with saran wrap and let them rise again on the warm heating pad for another 30 minutes. I baked them at 400 for 12 minutes then brushed them with vegetable oil right out of the oven (makes for soft tops). This was a decent roll recipe but I think it needs a little more butter or an egg. The potato flavor was nice but there really wasn't much flavor aside from that. I'm glad I thought to double the yeast. I don't think they'd come out as good and fluffy if I hadn't. Still it was a great dough to work with. I'd make this again with my small changes and the addition of an egg or extra butter.",

I prefer my bread to be slightly saltier and a bit richer. \n\nSo, I tweaked it just a tad and it's the best bread I've ever eaten in my entire life. And, I've eaten bread from a French bakery, in France, right as it came out of the oven. This is how good this is.\n\nChanges I made:\n1. I used the water from boiling potatoes instead of plain water.\n2. I increased the amount of sugar, salt, and butter called for in the recipe. Thus, for a half recipe, I used 1/4 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp salt, and 1/3 cup butter.\n3. I used freshly ground Spelt flour for just over half the flour called for.\n\nI know it might seem like I changed the recipe a lot, but it really was just some personal preference changes. The mother recipe is the best base recipe ever because it has all the crucial major elements that make the character of the bread.\n\nThank you, Zadi, for this recipe!!",

They still turned out well. Fluffy good rolls not an intense potato (or any other) flavor though. But a great vehicle for butter or other spreads. Not mind blowing I'll never make another recipe for rolls again but pretty decent and it was a good way to use up a bunch of left over potato flakes in my food storage.
