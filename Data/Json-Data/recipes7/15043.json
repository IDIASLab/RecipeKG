        "description": "In our family, a warm bowl of corn is always on our Thanksgiving table. My mom dumps a few bags of frozen corn into boiling water while the turkey rests and the potatoes get mashed. She'll then inevitably forget about the now water-logged corn until we are sitting at the table ready to eat. And still a Thanksgiving table without corn is not complete in my mind. This dish transforms frozen corn into a decadent and richly flavored dish with just a bit more work than setting a pot of water to boil.",

Before I added the peppers I poured some into a pie plate and baked -pepper free- for them which worked perfectly.  The adult one with peppers was mild still but delicious seconds were served!",

I covered a small non-stick pan in foil I sprayed in olive oil and kept a close eye on the timer I had to reset in the midst of cooking it but it came out lightly browned and fully cooked. I followed the recipe ingredients precisely. It was a nice easy side dish to make and I rather enjoyed the sweet note of it in contrast with everything else on our plates just then (chicken enchiladas and other not-so-sweet things). Three other people in my house reported liking it especially. My husband commented it was too sweet and I could see perhaps using a little less sugar; corn is sweet itself with butter. Nice pop of flavor with the peppers and corn and it went well with refried beans Mexican rice sliced green onions and fresh cilantro. Muchas gracias por la receta!",

I really would make this dish for breakfast. The reason I gave this recipe a two star was because I would not call it a pudding but rather a omelette. Very flavorful dish to say the least.",
