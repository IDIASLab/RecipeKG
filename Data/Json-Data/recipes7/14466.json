Last time I visited Brazil I was surprised to find cheese bread at the airport, offered along with American-brand pizza, though with a Brazilian brand that reminds us of this old Mineira tradition. (Minas-Gerais means the general mines, as this part of Brazil was the first where rich mines of gold, diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones were found. It is also where one of the world's richest iron ore deposits are located.)",

The texture of these is a bit hard on the outside but soft inside. I used a cheese similar to pepper jack so the spicy kick is really pleasurable. Everyone in the house liked them and devoured them in minutes. The fact that they are gluten free was super for us in a house of both celiacs and non! Thank you for the recipe.",
