This soup has a very creamy consistency but is completely dairy-free except for the optional garnish of sour cream (I did this on purpose due to a guest who is allergic to dairy). It is also extremely healthy. Don't shy away from the curry powder; it gives the soup that extra flavor. Feel free to play around with the amount of carrot, onion or celery, garlic to your taste. This soup can be made the day before and reheated.",

I blended the bacon in with the vegetables, rather than using it just for the drippings and as a garnish.  I added a little olive oil to the pan when sauteeing the celery and carrot.  My partner can't eat onions so I omitted that and I don't miss it.  I added nutmeg to the mix rather than as a garnish.  I didn't strictly follow the timing of cooking the celery, apples, garlic, etc. because I was going to boil it down over several hours.  This thick, creamy, comforting soup has a bouquet of flavors.  The squash, then the bacon, then the apple, then the curry and spices and celery and carrot and garlic bloom on your tongue.  Marvelous and complex.  This soup could sell for $8/bowl in a snazzy restaurant.  It's amazing!  I'm serving it tonight with a garlic/cheddar/mozzarella/parmesan bread and pomegranate juice and some vanilla yogurt drizzled with melted seedless blackberry jam.    ",

This has a rich blend of flavors that will catch peoples' attention yet is also somehow simple enough that my kids went back for seconds and thirds - something that almost never happens. A few notes: (1) I did not have apple cider onhand so used 3 cups of unsweetened applesauce with a touch of cinnamon instead and it came out great (I'll be curious to see if it's better/worse with cider next time); (2) I doubled the curry and still barely noticed it so would recommend others do the same; (3) if you use microwave steam bags for the squash you can avoid using the oven and can get it cooked in 6 minutes shaving some time off the overall prep time; and (4) definitely blend this... we're a family that likes chunky soups and I read the review suggesting to leave it chunky (I used a potato masher instead of blender) and the result was everyone in the family opting to stick theirs in the blender. This does not make a great chunky soup in my opinion but is restaurant-quality as a blended soup. This was truly excellent and the best thing we've made out of over 20 top-rated recipes from this site.",

I did not have bacon - so I just skipped this step and instead sauteed everything in butter and olive oil. (i also didn't have celery) I also went heavy on the curry. We are skipping the sour cream when serving because it's so good - and so healthy - why ruin a good thing. I think if I had used the bacon the sour cream might be needed. We'll see because I'm making this again for sure! Note - someone reviewed this and said it was too vinegary....? Made no sense to me and then I realized they must have used apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider. Made correctly - it isn't vinegary at all. The apple really makes this extra special.",

The only things I did differently was add two apples a little less carrots and celery and used 3 tablespoons of curry powder. I used two medium size butternut squashes which I cut in half and roasted and then scooped into the soup. The blend of flavors is outstanding. I will definitely be making this again!!",
