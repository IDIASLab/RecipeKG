A bit tricky to roll the dough out into the right size squares and to get the purses to close up properly. I may have worked the dough too much because they didn't puff up much during baking. But the end result was none-the-less beautiful and delicious and a unique side dish. The sauce is wonderful - don't leave that out!",
