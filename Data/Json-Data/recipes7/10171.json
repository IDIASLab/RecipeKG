I used 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch and a 1/2 cup of sugar (the recipe calls for 2 T of sugar or to taste) If you're using really tart apples you'll probably want to up that amount as a 1/2 cup wasn't very sweet. The baking temp. is off too. I cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes then turned the heat up for the last 5 minutes to brown the top. 350 is not hot enough to cook this pie! Alas even the cornstarch I added was not enough the pie is swimming in liquid. I used all fresh berries and fruit too. Next time I would add at least a 1/3 cup of flour and cook the filling on the stove top until it thickened before baking in the oven.",

I upped it to 1/4 cup but still it could use 1/2 cup or so. I also added cinnamon and then as I do with all my pies brushed milk on the top crust and sprinkled with a cinnamon/sugar mix. Next time I will add to the fruit mixture: some nutmeg as well and definitely flour! The potential is here. I have had this pie from a cafe in Ohio and it is out of this world!",
