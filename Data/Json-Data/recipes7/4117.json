We thought it was pretty good and I liked it better the next day although my husband liked it better the first day. I would recommend letting it fully cool down before eating it. One hour is not enough time to let it cool. I was a little skeptical of the recipe because of the ingredients for the dressing but it was a lot better then I thought it would be. I can't eat broccoli so we left that out which is ok with my husband cause he doesn't like it anyway. I cooked my chicken on the stove with some garlic salt and pepper then cut up my ham and cheese and added it all together with the pasta and dressing and put it in the fridge. For the dressing I just put everything in the blender including the parsley and blended it all together. I didn't bother to chop my onion and parsley because I knew the blender would take care of that. This salad was really easy to make and a good recipe for someone who has time to make something before work or school and then just come home and eat!",

I used small shell pasta and deli meat chicken and ham and I didn't have the swiss cheese (forgot to get it at the store) these were the only changes I made. The dressing was pretty good although it did have a little bit of an after taste not sure where that came from! The dressing could do without either the honey or the sugar. Will make again for a nice lunch and take a picture next time!",

I don't put the broccoli in since the first time I made it I forgot to pick some up at the store and loved it so much without it I've never tried it with it. I think it tastes best to eat it right after preparation instead of letting it cool for an hour. I just make sure to rinse the noodles in cold water for a minute so they aren't hot. When I'm making it for just my husband and me I take out the chicken and serve it with breaded chicken on the side as well as peas.
