If you want a more intense coconut flavor, add a teaspoon or two of coconut extract. Try putting your coconut in a food processor or blender if you prefer a smoother-textured cupcake. This is the first recipe I've come up with on my own, so any suggestions would be appreciated.",

I used coconut oil in place of the applesauce and the butter - because I didn't have any applesauce and prefer coconut oil to all other oils when baking or cooking.\n\nA nice frosting that I tried out recently that is great on the cupcakes - is 1 cup coconut oil, 3 cups powdered sugar, 5 teaspoons coconut milk.  Whip it up (I just used a fork and didn't bust out the electric mixer, but sure that works too) and spread on the cupcakes - will intensify the tasty coconut flavor even more.",

Wasn't sure how much coconut milk to use so just \"eyeballed\" the 1/2 can measurement. Made 15 cupcakes which baked for 22 minutes. Good cupcakes now. Probably perfect tomorrow after we lightly frost them!",

They must have made it into a cake or their oven temperature is way off. I left mine in for 25 minutes instead of 20 just to be safe and they turned out great! I think next time I will take the suggestion of putting my coconut in a food processor first. The texture is unexpected and a little strange to me but otherwise very tasty. One weird thing that I did was because I didn't have any coconut milk I used a can of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk and 1 tsp of almond extract with 3 oz of flavored coffee creamer. Sometimes you have to make due with what you have. lol Lucky for me they turned out very nice. Thanks",
