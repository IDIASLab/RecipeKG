I used the Reynolds no stick foil on the bottom of an 8x8 pan and followed the recipe.  When you are ready to pour the cooked mixture over the graham cracker crust, you need to have everything else ready for the topping because it gets set quite quickly.  Now I will be making a full batch using gluten-free crackers, and I'm sure these will be gone as quickly as the ones I made today.  Be sure to add these to your Christmas cookie platter!  You'll get compliments galore!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!",
