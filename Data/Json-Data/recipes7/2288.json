I used granola instead of Grape Nuts for the \"crunch\" and added a bit of coconut just because I love the stuff. I topped these off with some fat free Cool whip and these made wonderful parfaits that really hit the spot! These are perfect for when you need something for your sweet tooth that won't pack on the calories! Thanks for a great recipe Christine M!",

I had some summer fresh berries in my freezer that needed to be used up so I stirred in blackberries blueberries raspberries and strawberries. I didn't add the sugar it calls for and it wasn't missed because I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and thats sweet enough. I also used granola cereal because thats what I had. I put a TBSP of cereal in the bottom of the bowl followed by some mixed fruit then the yugort mixture. I finished it with more fruit whipped cream and a strawberry. It's such a pretty presentation and so simple to make. I also think that it's versatile to changes from the fruit to different flavour of yogurt. Excellent. THX.",

The blackberries were a little bitter and I didn't care much for seeds that were left in my teeth other than that this was a terrific meal. This would make a great dessert as well by adding some mini marshmallows.",

I just thawed out the berries just a touch and patted them a bit with a couple paper towels before tossing them with the pudding mixture. I used organic strawberries for the mash. I didn't add the extra sugar but I did add just a touch of organic honey. This was wonderful. We all wanted something sweet today not only that used fresh organic produce but also used healthy pantry ingredients that I already had as well. We all ate every bit and honestly we wanted more.
