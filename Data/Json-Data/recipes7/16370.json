This is the simple version of this recipe. It will make enough for about 2 large servings or 4 small ones. It's best to serve it in cup or small bowl.",

The mascarpone should be doubled but not the sugar in it just double the amount of mascarpone. I didn t care for the whipping cream in it either. The peach tea is a fantastic twist though. Great idea miscalculated measurements.",
