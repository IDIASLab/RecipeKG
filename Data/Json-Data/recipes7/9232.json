Not only is it way easier than most baking, since we do not particularly like baking, but love pumpkin bread, but it is easy to tweak a bit according to your taste. I added 1/4 tsp each of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves, and it was absolutely amazing. Stays moist for a week at least, maybe more, I wouldn\u2019t know since we ate it all within that week! Perfect. Thanks for this, from a non-baker :)",
