I have expensive taste but not a lot of money so I found a way to make my own almond butter and have a cheap alternative to peanut butter that is easy to make. I have found other recipes that are not very flavorful so I made up my own. Enjoy on toast, sandwiches, crackers, fruit, etc. It goes very well with anything you would put peanut butter on.",

Maybe next time I will take out the cinnamon and add a little cocoa powder too it to make it a bit like Nutella.",
