They followed the recipe exactly only they doubled the recipe AND they did not use white pepper only because I don't have it in the spice cabinet. They rubbed this on boneless pork short ribs, chicken legs and BLSL chicken breasts. It looked and smelled fantastic--the one issue that we had was it was REALLY spicy. Like overkill spicy. We all thought the flavor of the rub was right where it should be but the hot overpowered everything else. My husband said that we'd try this again but cut WAY back on the red pepper flake and maybe the black pepper. We all thought that this made the nicest crust on the meat and looked beautiful right off the grill.",
