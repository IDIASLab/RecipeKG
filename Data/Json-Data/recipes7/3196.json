Get the kids to help and start with a baseball to softball size piece and pull till golden.  It's a lot of fun on a family night although it tends to get eaten up during the pulling time.\n\nYou had problems with it because you have to butter your hands and pull it until you work enough air through it to make it set up.  All Taffy is like this, it has to be pulled for 15-20 minutes until it turns from dark brown to light golden and then it is cut into chunks and wrapped in wax paper.  Also, you should calibrate your candy thermometer BEFORE you start--boil some water and stick it in the water. If it doesn't read 212F at sea level then you need to add or subtract to get there and add/subtract the same amount of degrees for the taffy.  I've never made it at elevations over about 90 feet, so I don't know how it works in Denver.  Candy-making is extremely precise and not very forgiving.  Cooking you can improvise with good results . Baking is far more precise than cooking and candy-making requires extreme precision and is unforgiving to errors which is why so few bother, but you can't buy molasses taffy in a store and it's so so so good!  Use the strong blackstrap molasses for a rich depth of flavor, mild molasses isn't as tasty!",
