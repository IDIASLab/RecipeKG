I made a few changes - 2% milk instead of whole, 4 tbsp flour instead of corn starch, and 2 tsp peppermint extract instead of vanilla. I added the chocolate chips (dark chocolate) when the pudding was still warm stirred them in while they melted as mentioned by other reviewers. These turned out creamy, smooth and addicting (made 11 - 1/4 cup pops that I made in 3oz dixie cups). I'm going to try cutting the sugar in half the next time and trying different extracts but I will NEVER buy fudge pops again!!!\n\n**Update** \nI don't usually comment to this extent, but I just can't say enough... I've made these twice more cutting the sugar in half (still sweet enough) and adding 1 tsp almond extract to one batch and replacing 1 cup of the milk with coffee in the other. The almond one is tasty and satisfies the chocolate covered almond craving, and the coffee make a decadent cafe mocha fudge pop that I really just can't get enough of.... using coconut extract in the next batch and I can't wait!!",

Plan on the pudding taking considerably longer than the suggested 20 minutes or so to cool enough to put the chocolate chips in. I put them in after it had cooled for an hour and it was still warm enough to melt them. I would try stirring the pudding every 10 minutes or so during the cooling process to speed it up. They were quite sweet so I might try cutting the sugar down next time. Using 5 oz dixie cups as molds and filling them 3/4 full I was able to get 5 pops. The kids give these a 'million stars' rating and had fun helping make them.",
