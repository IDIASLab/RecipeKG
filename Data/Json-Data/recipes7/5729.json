I could not locate fresh dill heads and did not want the little pieces of green on the pickle, so I used dill seed.  What I liked about this recipe is the right balance of salt and sweet, the sterilization instructions, and the amount of processing time, and the fact that you can adapt this recipe to your tastes by adding garlic or hot peppers.  I did add 1/4 tsp of pickling crisp to each of my quart jars based upon advice from other Canners.  I used two tsps of dill seed per jar and added half of a seeded serrano pepper to two of the 4 jars.  My daughter is intrigued by the process so I am going back to the farmer's market for more cucumbers.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe that takes me down memory lane.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter 8 wks, we opened a jar and they were delicious.  The pickles are crunchy and the taste of the dill, garlic, salt, vinegar, and sugar are perfect.",

My crushed garlic did turn a bit blue...which I know is from the oxidizing from the vinegar.....no problem....just for flavor anyway....but a true 5 stars from this recipe....a very tasty and garlick-y, dill-y pickle in just 4 days.
