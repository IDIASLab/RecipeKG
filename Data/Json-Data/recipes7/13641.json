Drinking vinegars have been my jam for a few years and I'm elated to have found a recipe that gives me more control over the flavor (though I've made no adjustments to the recipe aside from subbing ground ginger a couple times). For a light and refreshing cocktail, mix together 1.5 ounces of the shrub and 1.5 ounces of gin, then top off the glass with club soda. (A shot glass makes measuring easy since a shot equals 1.5 ounces.)",
