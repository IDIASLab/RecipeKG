Also there is no need to pinch the ends closed. They look prettier if left open... We loved these flaky crispy buttery chocolaty petit pain au chocolat and served with steaming cafe au lait!",

The first folding would be less messy if you chilled the dough a bit after proofing. I also made cuts for the chocolate to show through (and look more like store-brought). I baked about 12 mins and they turned out lovely golden brown. The taste is different from the normal croissant but still soft fluffy and slightly flaky.",

My husband and I who recently returned from a vacation in Europe and there fell in love with the chocolate-filled croissants really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks!",

It was better once the chocolate had cooled but I live at a higher altitude and the croissant came out really hard once cooled.

Working the butter into the dough is so very critical do not rush this step. You can leave the dough in overnight after you have worked the butter though it instead of 30 minutes. I roll my dough similiar to rolling cinnamon rolls. Cut it in 1/2 (6x21\") and make 2 rows of chocolates one starting at the beginning of the roll and the second one at the half mark. Roll it into a tube and cut into 3\" pieces. I want to try making them next using an almond paste. Thanks so much for sharing this.",

For one make sure you prep your yeast - warm water (105 F) with the sugar and then add the yeast to the water for 5 to 10 minutes or until it is frothy (I didn't do that! Massive Oops!) You need to make sure the dough rises too (I didn't do that - massive Oops!) and you really need to wait between rolling out the dough (I did do that!). If you want them to look like real croissants (real as in the ones you see in a bakery) you have to cut them into triangles (learned this after I made them rolls... oh boy!). Mine are in the oven now for the 15 minutes... hope they taste good!!!...... 20 minutes later... OMG delicious! Even though I made some giant mistakes they are oh so good! i will be doing this recipe again for sure the right way!",
