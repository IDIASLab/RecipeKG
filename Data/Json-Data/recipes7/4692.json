I use the whole rings of pineapple and cut in 1/4's. It adds a different dimention if 1/4 cup or less...to taste, of citrus zest is used.  Orange is fantastic, but I like Lime or lemon best.

My sons girlfriend helped me to figure out that I was probably supposed to add a small amount of sugar. Hence \"Gradually add sugar continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.\" I decided to persevere. It took a long time whip up to stiff peak stage. It had a texture like a meringue. I used my kitchenaid stand mixer. Then I combined the yolks butter & milk which didn't incorporate smoothly probably for lack of sugar. I added pineapple and bread (used Country White as per another reviewer) and then it went together better. I also added a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest to batter. I folded in the egg white/sugar and popped it in a glass baking dish lined with parchment. It filled up the 11x7 inch pan. I was afraid that it would puff up and overflow. It did puff up a little bit but didn't overflow. Then it kinda flattened out when I took it out of the oven. The end result- it was really delicious. Everybody loved it. There was nothing left. Scalloped Pineapple was a great accompaniment to Ham.",
