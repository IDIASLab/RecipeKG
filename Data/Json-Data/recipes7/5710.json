I'm surprised no reviewer commented on it, but it says to put the cobbler under the berries, not on top.  It worked okay--I guess, but I kept thinking it wasn't done since the middle was still liquidy--that was the berries, not the cobbler.  I'd reverse it next time, bc it makes a good cobbler otherwise.  I did use less sugar, and splenda instead, and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.",

I didn't add the 1 cup of water since the freshly picked blackberries produced their own juices when I add the sugar to it. Followed the cake exactly as indicated. I put parchment paper on the bottom of the baking pan and put the blackberries on top of the paper and the batter on top the blackberries. After they were done baking and let it cool for about an hour, I flipped the pan over on a big plate and garnished it with more fresh blackberries. It was pretty sweet but I like it that way to counter act some of the tartness of the blackberries.",
