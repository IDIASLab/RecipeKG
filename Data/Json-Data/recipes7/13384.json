This cake cracked, so I recommend doing a water bath.  Also, I did not toast the pecans as is my norm, so for the ultimate pecan flavor I would toast the pecans, just be sure they are cooled before you add them to the mixture.  The sour cream gives it a tangy flavor which my husband loved.  It is a nice, creamy dessert.",

Once it cooled, I added a sour cream topping (1 cup sour cream mixed with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and a tsp vanilla) and then spread the remaining crust over the top. It tuned out wonderful!",

Although the cheesecake filling was really good, I found myself picking out the pecans. The pecans in the pie crust was amazing, I just wasn't too fond of them in the filling like I thought I would be. I will make the crust and cheesecake again just without the pecans in the filling. Oh, and the water bath is really needed for this recipe. My whole family loved this cheesecake so it could just be my tastebuds.",
