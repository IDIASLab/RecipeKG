I made these to bring to Thanksgiving dinner and my company the night before ate half of the tray not realizing this dessert was not for them:) With that said I followed the recipe except I had homemade crandberry sauce on hand from another recipe. I used that instead of the sauce suggested. I also used 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I felt the almond would be to overpowering. Definetly make these the night before as it allows the crust to set and congeal. Serving after baking the crust crumbled. Delicious easy to make and festive!",

If you use frozen berries I recommend putting the berries and sugar on warm until the berries thaw you may not need to add extra water for the cooking mine were a little too watery even with extra cooking time. The lemon juice was a bit overpowering added a spoonful of Amaretto (from the liqueur recipe on this site) and 2 Tbp sugar to the cream cheese before it met family approval. This baked up nicely and tasted better on the next day. When I make this again I'll add more almond flavoring and more cranberries.",
