I've compared this recipe to similar SBT recipes and i think adding in the corn syrup is key to preventing sugar crystalization.\n\nHere's what i do: in a 5qt pot add all the ingredients + 2T corn syrup and set to medium.  Let dissolve/melt together before stirring constantly, around 170 degrees, then start stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Once it comes to a boil, reduce to medium low heat (as I'm impatient) and constantly stir until closer to 240 degrees.  Turn off + remove from heat; instead of beating vigorously by hand, i plugged in my hand mixer and beat on low for 3min (temperature wise it was around 210 after 3min.)  With my foil lined with Pam sheet pan, I poured the whole mixture + scrapped the sides.  The mixture setup perfectly and had a smoother texture...vs the gritty texture I've experienced in the past.  So delicious... Enjoy!",

I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just cooked the mixture for 40 minutes while stirring with a wooden spoon. Then I cooled the mixture while stirring with a whisk for 5 minutes. I didn't wait until the mixture began to feel grainy. I just stopped whisking once it reached the consistency of brownie batter. It set perfectly and has a smooth glossy finish and a knife literally glides through the firm tablet just like butter. The texture is smooth and velvety and absolutely to die for! I used whole milk as I didn't have cream. I also didn't have unsalted butter so I used regular lightly salted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe. Perfect!",

Came out perfect , set up perfectly...I cut the recipe in half and also added a tablespoon of Trimoline which is an Invert Sugar.. Not readily available I happen to keep it on hand because I'm a pastry chef... You can use Light Corn Syrup instead this prevents crystallization , acts as a preservative and gives a better mouth feel to the tablet.... It also adds to the caramelization ... Which will bring your temperature higher thus cooking faster so use it and you won't have the issues other reviewers are having getting up to temperature I reached the temperature in 16 minutes \nIt makes a big difference... Use 2 tablespoons of invert sugar for the full recipe .... I also used my hand mixer & beat it for 3 min to cool off ... I was done making this in less than 30 min ..... It set up perfectly ..... Only suggestion is less butter to taste more like dulce de Leche. Hope this review helps others.",
