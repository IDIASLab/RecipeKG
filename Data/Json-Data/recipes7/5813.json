Oh by the way do as I didn't and wear gloves to pit the cherries I do believe my finges will forever be stained with the cherries but it's cherries and well worth the red fingers. I have a large canning funnel which I use when putting the food into jars to help keep the rims of the jars clean which is very important as Pepper stated. The jam was excellent; the flavor is very definitely cherry and the color is beautiful.",

I finally made this one, and I'm glad I did.\n\nI cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3 cups.  It made the jam tart and perfect.  I used 1.5 packages of pectin instead of 2 because I don't like my jam to be really firm like store-bought jellies.  I think 1.5 was still too much, and next time I'll just do 1 packet.  Because I cut out 1 cup of sugar, I only got 1 pint of jam.  I kind of want to make more now.\n\nThe jam was easy, and I loved the simple ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

What I do have are two bushes of Nanking cherries, those teeny little red berries that are more pit than fruit, but oh so tasty. So I picked my Naking bushes clean... And got me about a whole cup once pitted... I went to the farmers market and made up the difference with some BC cherries and the results were fabulous! I probably  didn't even need to go through the process of canning the jam since we're consuming it faster than a Cullen can run ;)",

It's very unfair of you to chastise a recipe because you didn't follow it properly. I have experience with jam. If you ended up with a syrup following this recipe it's because you didn't follow the recipe. Period. You tried to double it up most likely, and the pectin doesn't like that. Or you let it boil with the pectin for too long. I've made this and several recipes very similar to it each year for the past few years. I always follow the recipe closely and I always end up with \"jam\". My friend followed the same recipe but he wanted to make up eight jars at once instead of four so he doubled the recipe, and he ended up with syrup. \n\nI just didn't like seeing the one star review complaining about syrup when I know 100% that it was their own doing.",
