That being said I didn't really find this any different than a pomodoro-type sauce which doesn't have the added calories from butter/milk. I enjoyed this but I can't see making it again simply because the butter/milk didn't convey any additional richness to make it worth the extra calories. I added some onion to the garlic and uses a heaping tsp of garlic as opposed to \"3/4 of clove\". I too added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little heat. THANKS for the recipe!",
