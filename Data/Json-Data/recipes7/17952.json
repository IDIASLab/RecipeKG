What you get with your first bite is a burst of fresh strawberry flavor. It s moist tender has a tasty soft crumble on the top and is rich. Baked in a 9\" springform pan. It s the same recipe as has been on another site since 2006 except this one calls for cake flour the instructions are written just a bit differently and Summer has been added to the name. That s OK because it was hit for the other site and it ll be a hit for Allrecipes.",
