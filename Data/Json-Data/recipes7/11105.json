Followed submitter's small notes with little changes.\" The recipe submitter mentions in the description adding 1/4 c. cocoa powder (which I did) along with reducing sugar (which I also did - the white sugar to 1/2 c. and the brown sugar to 1/3 c. brown sugar/Splenda blend.) I never know when a cookie recipe calls for \"oats\" if that means old-fashioned or quick-cooking (obviously not instant though) so in this case I used old-fashioned making the cookie a little chew-ier which is fine by me. I had to check the ingredient list a few times to make sure I wasn't missing baking powder or baking soda but nope neither of those there; also saw no cinnamon listed and felt like it needed a touch and I probably used a 1/4 tsp. I definitely didn't get 60 cookies out of my dough though unless the cookies were teeny-weeny. I made decent sized balls of dough and flattened them out w/ the bottom of a soup can and ended up w/ around 40-ish cookies. Ate one w/ a cup of mother's milk tea that afternoon and while I may not have noticed a difference in my milk supply my LO was happy to nurse and I was happy to be eating a good relatively healthy cookie.",

The brewers yeast does leave a little bit of a weird aftertaste in these cookies which does get old after awhile but it is still more pleasant than gagging it down in some juice.",
