I'm the submitter of this recipe and there are a few things I'd like to share about this dish: I normally can only get 8 strips out of a single sheet of puff pastry which is perfect (just use 4 horizontally & 4 vertically) and you wouldn't have to cut the vertical ones in half just trim a bit...sorry AR published the '10 strips' thing. Also leave the skin on the apples!! (Easier & tastier) being sure not to cut the apples to small; cut them into medium-sized chunks. I like to use dried apricots cranberries raspberries & blueberries for the dried fruit part - but use what you've got. Walnuts can also be subbed for the pecans.",

                "reviewBody": "Very nice dessert.  I really wanted to make this and didn't have apples, so I used 3 cans of peaches instead.  The amount of time called for was perfect to brown the lattice and create a nice bubbly syrup.  I did cut the sugar slightly since I had canned peaches (for apples I'd have left it the same) and used the syrup instead of water.  I am so horrible at dividing dough:  I'm not sure what I was thinking, but I cut 6 slices of the pastry instead of 8.  When I realized my error, I cut small strips on four of the bigger strips (bc of course I didn't make them even) and put them together to make 2 strips.  It still worked just great and I couldn't even tell after I baked it--that's how forgiving it is!   It turned out lovely, and when I have apples I definitely would love to try again.  Thank you for the recipe, CookinginFL!",
