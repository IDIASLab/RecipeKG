I added a bit of flour, parmesan and salt to the breadcrumbs and didn't need the egg as my chicken was wet from the buttermilk.  Pounded flat, dipped in breadcrumbs, back in buttermilk and again in breadcrumbs. Sauteed in olive oil, topped with cheese on a rack and broiled for a few minutes.  Yummy!  To the previous reviewer, if you pounded your chicken breasts to the recommended thickness they should only take a few minutes per side!",

I made Mozzarella sticks ( http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/az/FridMzzrllChsSticks.asp ) with this dish and the sauce went great with them. The only things I plan on changing next time I make this is I will put sauce on the chicken before I put the cheeze on it. Also If your chicken is to thick butterfly it. Thick chicken in my opinion is no good for this recipe. I had thick chicken and just pounded the out of it and I felt it was still a bit to thick. 1 1/4 inchs thick is really pushing it. I think 3/4 - 1 inch would have been perfect. If you can get the chicken down to 3/4 - 1 inch by beating it that would be better but if you have to just butterfly it. Buy butterfly I mean slice it in half like a __________________Top of chicken _ _ _ _ _cut here so the top half flaps over. __________________bottom of chicken It will look like a butterfly when you are done.",
