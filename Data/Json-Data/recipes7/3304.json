For the dressing, I shake the following together in a medium sized glass jar:  garlic, lime juice, & salt in the amounts as written plus 3/4 c pineapple juice (instead of water), 1-2 T sugar (instead of 2T), 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, & 1 T olive oil. I let the dressing sit for 5-10 minutes to let the flavors mingle, then shake again and pour over the salsa. This would be fantastic in August with fresh, local peaches. Right now I used canned, drained peaches and pineapple (save the juice for the dressing), and it is a great, change-of-pace salsa for chips or with grilled chicken.",

                "reviewBody": "I make this all the time and it is definitely time consuming! Recently, I acquired a Ninja system and that has helped cut down on how long I spend chopping. Try to stick with fresh fruit and vegetables if you can! Or if you prefer canned tomatoes, get sodium/HFCS free. Sometimes canned tomatoes can taste... well... tinny. Also, I normally add a load of jalapeno but somehow forgot to put that on the recipe when I posted this. Serrano peppers work equally as well. Sub in a walla wall or vidalia onion for extra natural sweetness. The water is there to simply allow the flavors to all meld together. However, if your produce is really juicy you won't need it. So, you be the judge. If you don't have peaches, nectarines are awesome here!. A lot of people have said that this makes a lot and it does! However, at family functions I use the ENTIRE pineapple and an extra mango with about twice as much cilantro and twice the onion to make enough. It never lasts. Try it on your next fish tacos or blend some with a bit of olive oil and red wine vinegar to make a healthy salad dressing. (Goes great on grilled chicken too and I recently made this as a topping for el pastor).. HELPFUL HINT-- A little extra sugar and a bit of extra salt will up the flavor and help pull the juices out of the fruit if you don't have time to let this sit. Stir it a couple times an hour and press the fruit down into the juice. Seems silly, but it works",

                "reviewBody": "I agree with the others that mentioned how they disliked the cilantro. This recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH of it. I think it is safe to say that the cilantro ruined what otherwise would have been a really good salsa. This recipe is good enough to make again but next time I'll definitely keep the cilantro to a bare minimum. I wouldn't get rid of it completely because the cilantro does add flavor and kick to it but because it is such a strong herb the MOST I'll add next time is 1/5 cup probably less. I put the salsa over some salmon but I liked the salmon better without the salsa. Maybe the excessive amount of cilantro steered me away. It may have otherwise been really good. Keep note that this recipe is set to yield 16 servings which I didn't realize until after I had made it. It makes a lot. I also added only half an onion and I'm glad I did especially because I'm not a big fan of using lots of onion. A small amount is okay but I think a whole onion would have been too much Tomorrow I plan on making the same recipe (but this time not using any cilantro) and adding it to what I currently have to weaken the intensity of the cilantro. My advice is that if you're not sure about using the large amounts of a particular food that this recipe calls for (such as onion or cilantro) use only half of what the recipe calls for. See how you like it. If you think it needs more add more. Be careful because once you add too much there's no getting it out...",
