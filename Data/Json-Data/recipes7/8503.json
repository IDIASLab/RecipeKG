                "reviewBody": "A dash of ground nutmeg (freshly ground is best) in the frosting and 1/4 tsp in the cake underscores the eggnog flavor.  Because it is so moist, it's a great keeper and freezes perfectly. I see that some people have had trouble with the cake being dry or heavy. Be aware that butter cakes are rarely light and super airy.  However, if the heaviness was objectionable, there are two possible reasons for this. First, if there is too much flour, the product will be heavy. Measure by dipping a spoon into the flour and keep doing until the cup measure is full. Sweep the backside of a knife across the top to level. Do not scoop the flour with your cup measure. Alternatively, you could sift the flour into a cup and level. Secondly, if the product was overmixed, that would account for a heavy product. After you cream the butter/sugar/egg/extract mixture, try folding in the dry ingredients by hand. Excessive mixing encourages gluten formation, which is the element that gives bread its structure and chewiness. If dry, that indicates overbaking. Ovens vary, so given timing might not be perfect for your oven. Check 10 minutes before time is up and adjust accordingly. Bake only until a toothpick comes out clean and sides begin to release. If your frosting feels gritty, mix the butter and sugar for 5-10 minutes with your mixer, until the sugar \"creams.\" Test it by rubbing some of it between your fingers. If it feels smooth, then proceed. If not, mix awhile more until it's no longer grainy.",

I followed the recipe for the eggnog included in the footnotes; the only change I made was to add fresh-grated nutmeg to the cake batter and the frosting. I garnished the slices with whipped cream and more grated nutmeg. I also sliced one of my cake layers in half (it was a little larger than the other) and had enough frosting to fill three layers and frost the cake. I omitted the pecans, because I wanted a smooth cake without the crunch, but I bet they'd be tasty. Even the non-eggnog fan loved it: \"Now this is about the only reason for eggnog to exist, as far as I'm concerned.\" Delicious!",

I am a fan of eggnog so felt sure I would enjoy the cake though I am not a big cake fan. The cake was moist and the frosting was turned out like something closer to icing which was fine. Consider trimming the crown of the bottom cake so the top cake will fit better. Without the trim you run the risk of having a lopsided eggnog cake. I definitely recommend this cake for Christmas or any occasion around the holidays.",
