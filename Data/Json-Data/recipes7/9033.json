This stew was was my first time trying turnips and I would describe the taste to be like tangy potatoes. This dish was interesting. The mix of flavors is different than what I have had before. While it is not my favorite dish I liked it fine and my husband commented that he enjoyed it. I think for me personally I found the maple syrup to be slightly off putting. So if I were to make this again I would leave the syrup out.",

I will be making this again.:) I didn't add the maple syrup I thought that was weird and I'm Canadian! Instead I added an additional tbsp of sugar. Turnips were not in my grocery store I don't think they were quite in season yet but I used 5 locally grown parsnips which are quite a bit alike. Check out how mine turned out I posted a pic;) I served mine with Great Grandma's Cucumber Salad (it's a family recipe of mine I will share the recipe) and streamed carrots.",
