I chose eggnog because that flavor isn't my favorite and I didn't want to be tempted to eat a TON of it. I cut a piece to bring a coworker and noticed how moist it looked and had to try some myself. PEOPLE this has got to be one of the most delicious and professional tasting cakes ever. It has a strong but delicious and rich eggnog flavor. It was very easy too aside from the weird geletin in water thing which I found to be clumpy but mixed into the whipped cream anyway. I sprinkled mine with some color since it was white white white. If you are a fan of eggnog do NOT pass this one up! My house still smells delicious days later too!",

I did make some alterations - I used a white cake mix instead of yellow I didn't have rum extract I used vanilla instead I also used oil instead of butter. I baked in a 10x13 pan and didn't use the filling. For the icing I used 500ml of whipping cream 1cup of icing sugar 1/2cup of eggnog & 1 pkg instant vanilla pudding. This cake was super moist & even my husband who doesn't like eggnog loved this cake. I will definitely make this again!",
