When it does, just add water until it gets the creaminess back!  Thanks for the recipe!",

I also used only the whites of the hard boiled eggs and the yolks weren't missed at all. I didn't have elbow macaroni in my pantry so I used small penne and it was just fine. I didn't need to increase the amount of mayonnaise even with the increase in pasta...it was still very creamy...could even have used less in order to be a little bit more healthy. This is easy and oh so delicious. I will make this again soon! I hard boiled extra eggs while making the three for this recipe - to keep in the fridge for egg salad or a snack.
