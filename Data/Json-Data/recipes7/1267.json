First I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great. The second time I made it I added one TB of soy milk substitued 1/8 cup of wheat germ for i/8 cup of the flour and added two TBS of brandy. This also turned out great. I baked it in a buttered and floured pie dish then unmolded it and dusted it with powdered sugar. On Christmas Eve I'll serve it with brandied whipped cream on the side.",

Once it was baked it retained the same flavor which was of salt and fizzy baking soda. It was horrible! Please look over the ingredients list!",

It makes it moist, decadently dense and a smidge less sweet, which I prefer. \r\n\r\nI also like to double this recipe and cook it in my grandmother's bundt pan (adding about 20 minutes to the cooking time) and I find that a water bath helps keep it moist and uncracked.\r\n\r\nThis year I've had to cut out gluten but didn't want to cut out this holiday favorite. To replace the flour I used 1/2 Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour, 1/4 Tapioca Flour and 1/4 Sorghum Flour plus 2 tsp of xanthum gum.\r\n\r\nOther additions: a jigger of brandy cream, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. 1/4 tsp cloves.\r\n\r\nMy family loves this and fondly refers to it as Piggy Pudding.",
