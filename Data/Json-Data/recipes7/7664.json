                "reviewBody": "When I received this recipe in the Newly Published email I was intrigued. The most adventurous I've gotten with my rice cooker was to cook quinoa in it;) I never would have thought about using it for a Muffin/Cake. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for the taste. The flavor is perfect in the recipe. Though I did have to sub canola for olive oil I was almost out and needed it for dinner. Also because my family hates raisins:( I used dried cranberries. Now my rice cooker apparently has a safety shutoff feature on it and so I couldn't just keep pushing the cook button. I don't know if this is standard or what. But it took me about 4 hours to get this cooked. The first round it was probably about 1/2 cooked. After that first time I had to let the rice cooker cool for about 25 minutes so I could let the cake cook another 10 minutes. It was very frustrating. But this could just be my rice cooker. I don't know. Even though it did finally cook through the top kind of stayed wet a bit. I expected that though. I think next time I'll just use a muffin tin. But it was interesting to find out I can do more than just rice!",

I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. Like another reviewer my rice cooker had to wait about 20 minutes between cycles for it to turn onto \"cook\" again since it was already so hot. I will make this in the oven next time but will be making it again!",

When it was demonstrated at a party it was filled with cake batter (one mix made by the directions) and you put a large spoon of canned frosting in the middle and microwaved for 10 minutes on high. I have made this several times and it always turns out very good. I am going to try the muffin cake recipe using the same technique. Thanks for a great idea!",
