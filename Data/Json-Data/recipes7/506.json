The first time I made them I used a smaller baking sheet and I had to bake them for about 30 minutes. This time I used a 15 x 10 pan and it was better. I still had to cook them for 18 minutes yet they are still the gooey texture you should look for. These are very easy to mix up! I would recommend not greasing the baking sheet; with this amount of oil it's really not necessary and makes the batter much easier to spread. I add 3t of baking powder and 1t of salt to the recipe with all-purpose flour.",
