Our little grocery store didn't have cranberry vinegar but I did have balsamaic raspberry vinegar which I used. I tried it after it was first pureed and couldn't decide. The flavor was unique but not unpleasant. I let it come to room temp while I made the rest of our meal and sampled it again and then couldn't stop \"sampling\". I really really like this (BF is still unsure). This is not your mother's canned beets! This is a \"impress your friends and family\" recipe. It's that good.",

I had to make a few substitutions: couldn't find a vidalia onion so I used a sweet onion (not a regular yellow onion). I also couldn't find cranberry vinegar thought I had some raspberry vinegar at home but didn't so I used balsamic. And in place of butter I used a Smart Balance 50/50 stick (half butter half SB) to cut back on the fat. Otherwise I followed the recipe. This is a very unique side dish very rich wonderful texture and you can taste the different flavors as you eat it but in a subtle way as they meld together beautifully. Finally I thought it a shame to toss the beautiful greens from my beets so I found a recipe for beet greens & got another side dish out of those!",
