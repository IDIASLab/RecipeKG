My grandma made something like this for us kids when we were small so it was nice to remember her and talk about her a little while we made this recipe. My eldest son helped me make these and we accidentally made a little slip and added a little more than a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract but it didn't affect the outcome of the pop. We all enjoyed these this afternoon the kids especially. I thought they were quite sweet but my kids and husband thought they were perfect as is. I'd like to try this for myself as a diet recipe perhaps using a diet cream soda and eliminating the extra sugar OR using honey as a substitute for the sugar. As is huge hit with the fam!",

These tasted even better than I had hoped they would! I went in search of small plastic cups to no avail so I just used my popsicle mold and I poured the leftover mixture into an ice cube tray. I made these the night before to allow them to freeze solid. I had an easier time getting them out of the ice cube tray than the popsicle mold (no fault of the recipe I've always had trouble with this mold). No matter they were still wonderful with just the right balance of sweetness and flavor. Gabe and I just got finished 'taste testing' them lol and we both declared these delicious! Thanks SHORECOOK for such a wonderfully refreshing treat that will be made over and over many times!:)",

Incidentally while waiting on them to solidify in the freezer I discovered that about 3/4 of the way through they make an excellent vanilla slush. I think next time I might try to pour the mixture into goblets then freeze for less time in order to make slushies out of them. Either way these are awesome. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

The bottled soda pop is 12oz so I adjusted the recipe quantities accordingly: 12oz soda 1c. water 1/4c. sugar (I used Splenda granular) and 1/8 tsp. vanilla. I made 4 popscicles and 1 tray of pop cubes. The pops taste wonderful and refreshing. I plan to make a second batch using orange soda and orange extract since my DS loves orange soda.
