I microwaved the mini marshmallows and milk at 50% power for 45 seconds twice, stirring after each time increment which makes quick work of the melting marshmallow step.  For the crumb base I subbed 1/2 ginger snap cookies and processed them in the food processor with the graham cracker crumbs and the butter.  I reserved 1/2 cup to sprinkle on top just because the crumbs were so tasty! Used a chilled bowl and beaters which helped with the whipped cream on such a hot and toasty day! I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

Thus instead of mini marshmallows I used 5 c. of the regular size. Also I had Redi-whip left over from a party so I used 7 c. of that instead of the cream and sugar. I added about 6 iced oatmeal cookies with the graham cracker mixture for added flavor. I used 6 white peaches diced and made these in muffin tins. I made a dozen individual servings in muffin tins then had enough left over to fill a pie dish as well -- and still had about three cups of peaches left for snacking! I filled each muffin tin with about 1 T. graham cracker mixture 1 T. whipped mixture 1 1/2 T. peaches 1 T. whipped mixture and a sprinkle of graham cracker mixture on top. The dessert holds up fairly well in the muffin tins and doesn't require spoons if you eat carefully.",
