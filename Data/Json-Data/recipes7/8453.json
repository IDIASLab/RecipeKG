However 12 hours later the flavors have melded and the mint isn't so raw and they are actually quite good. I still think there is too much sugar in the recipe along with the chocolate syrup and suggest only using half as much. I am glad I went back for another taste. Thank you Madison it's always fun to try a new recipe.",
