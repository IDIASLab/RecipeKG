After the marinade time, the steak can be frozen in meal-sized portions for quick meals later. The flavor of this carne asada is much better, and the meat much more tender, than any I have had in Mexican restaurants. If cut in strips, this meat also works very well for fajitas. Serve with tortillas, Mexican rice, and beans.",

One thing that should be mentioned is that the silver skin should be removed from the meat before putting it into the marinade. This helps to make the meat more tender. For my family, this is enough for 4 meals. After 24 hours of marinating, I divide the meat, cilantro, and marinade into 4 freezer bags. This provides us with 4 quick meals that I need to add only refried beans and Mexican corn.  This recipe is one of my family's favorites.",
