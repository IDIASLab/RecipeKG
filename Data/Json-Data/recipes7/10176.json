It has become a holiday favorite in our family.\n\n  It is worth noting that this is essentially a pound cake. That means that, by design, the texture is denser and heavier than a layer cake. That means that, generally speaking, smaller servings are in order.\n\n  The recipe here is basically the same as my aunt's, except that instead of using 1-1/2 cups of butter, 1 cup of butter and 1/2-cup of all-vegetable shortening are used in the cake. The shortening changes the texture slightly, giving the cake a smoother texture. \n\n  Another difference is in the glaze. Instead of using milk, melted butter is used; and 1-2 Tbsp. of lemon juice is used instead of vanilla extract. If the glaze is too thick, either additional butter or lemon juice can be added. The lemon juice flavor in the glaze complements the flavor of the cake.\n\n  I prefer 7up, but my mother sometimes uses Mountain Dew instead of 7up, which yields a slightly different flavor; but delicious, nonetheless.",

Yes it's a dense cake but as long as you make sure you blend the sugar and butter completely and don't over beat once you add the flour, this cake will melt in your mouth. The crust on the outside is the absolute truth. I get several requests to make this cake!!",
