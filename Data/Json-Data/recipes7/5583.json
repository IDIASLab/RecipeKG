The sparkling fizz makes it taste fresh and feel good on your throat, while the sugar, lime, and green tea add a zingy sensation to the old taste. This is a personal family favorite, and I made it up in my own kitchen! Perfect for parties, get-togethers, and family picnics on hot summer days.",

Have now made this with True Lemon and True Orange as well as the True Lime, 2 pkts each time.  So Good!",

I used splenda instead of sugar and it worked fine. I didn't think it needed more sweetening but I'm not a fan of sugar in my tea. I used a mint green tea and I liked that flavor but bf wasn't impressed. Not sure if it's the mint or the whole idea he didn't like but he didn't drink it. I enjoyed it though and may try with plain green tea next time. thanks for the recipe!",
