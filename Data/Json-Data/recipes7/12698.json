She complimented me in that she said that she had never tasted a tiramisu as good as this in all of Europe! Wow. This tiramisu is not too sweet. The mascarpone does well to balance out the texture and sweetness. I used a dark chocolate powder using a tea strainer to do a medium dusting of the chocolate on top of each layer. I also waited until I was going to serve the dish before dusting the top with chocolate for a better presentation.",
