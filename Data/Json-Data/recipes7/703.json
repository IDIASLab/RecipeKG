I increased the persimmon puree to about 2 1/2c. and used 2 eggs (felt the 2 T. egg was a typo). In addition to the spices listed I added about 1 tsp. of allspice. I used whole grain flours and (since I didn't want to mill more whole wheat pastry flour) I used half spelt flour. At the end of mixing I stirred in 1 c. butterscotch chips and 1 c. flaked coconut. These cookies turned out very moist like a good fruit cookie should. I noticed more of the persimmon flavor than in other persimmon cookie recipes I've tried and really liked that. The stir-ins I added gave additional sweetness and texture. I will be using this recipe again and next time I'm going to try stirring in some raisins.",
