I know oven temps vary, but  these are small, and it wouldn't take much for them to overbake and dry out.  I wondered if the sugar mixture would stick, since many other recipes call for you to first dip them in melted butter...well, it did!  I would think coating them while the muffins are still warm is key,  since they still have a little moisture on the outside, still steaming a bit.  Thanks, authenticnut, we enjoyed your mini doughnuts!",

My oldest loved it and the little one really liked it.  After first batch was gone, they begged me to make a second batch the same day.  I did.  What can I say...they are that easy to make.  The second batch, however, I played around with.  I added applesauce in place of some of the butter.  I doubled the recipe, so I used one of those individual sized applesauce with 2 tablespoons of butter instead, and I left the nutmeg amount the same at about a 1/4 teaspoon or less.  The nutmeg flavor was really strong in the first batch for my liking.  So with the changes made, and the house smelling wonderfully good after baking the second batch, I let my biggest food critics try them out.  Guess what they loved these even more, although they seemed more cake like and not so flaky.  One tray went the same night and the next tray was gone within 2 days.  A keeper for sure.",

I didn't apply spray or oil on the pan before adding the mix and there was slight residue to clean up prior to baking the next pan. No problem!  The cinn/sugar stuck just fine.

The recipe as is makes about 6 servings (donuts) in my baking donut shaped pans. I doubled the recipe and got 12 over sized donuts. Would NOT change any of the main ingredients or portions. I will definitely try this recipe again and again. I like using this as a base and mixing up the flavor.  Followed the oven temp also at 350. Thanks to whom ever shared the original recipe!",
