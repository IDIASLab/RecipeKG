The bread pudding itself however is very good. I didn't have cinnamon raisin bread so I used a whole cup of raisins and upped the amount of cinnamon to a whole Tbsp. I also added a bit of nutmeg. I doubled the amount of rum and used 2 apples that I thinly sliced and didn't bother cooking because they cook inside the bread pudding. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1 & 1/4 cup of half and half and 3 eggs. Make sure you use stale bread so as to not get things overly soggy (I used stale hoagie rolls). I used a 9 inch sprinform pan and put a baking sheet underneath during baking. The bread pudding is delicious and has a really nice rum flavor. The rum sauce however is not that good and really not necessary. I would use a vanilla sauce over top of this or just a a bit of whipped cream.",

My instincts told me to follow some of the adjustments suggested by Glamadana, and she turned out to be correct.  I used a whole loaf of bread and a can of evaporated milk to which I added a 1/2 cup of milk to make 2 cups total.  And I also used the 3 eggs and 7 TBS butter she suggested.  Unfortunately I forgot to double the sauce recipe, but will do so the next time.  This could not have been any better.  My husband just loves this bread pudding.  It is definitely a keeper.  The flavor and the texture is perfect, and the rum sauce is delightful and light.  I will probably use it on some other things.  If I changed anything I might add a tiny bit more rum to the main recipe, but it is not really important.  The recipe works as is.  Thanks Chicagocook22 for sharing this one.",

It also has raisins and prunes in it but there is always leftover prunes and raisins. I didn't want to waste them so I started searching for a recipe I could incorporate them into and came across this one. It was delicious. When it came time to sauteing the apples I tossed the prunes and raisins in and cooked slightly. The final touch was that wonderful rum sauce. OH MY GOODNESS is that ever good. -though my husband happened to be walking by when I was finishing it up and he tasted it and said \"It needs more Rum!\" as he tipped the bottle and poured about a 1/4 cup in. It was very rummy and very delicious. Such a great recipe. I will definitely make this one again.",
