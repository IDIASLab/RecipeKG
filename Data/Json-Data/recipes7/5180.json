                "reviewBody": "My bananas were REALLY super ripe (I dug them out of the deep freeze--trying to use up everything in the deep freeze to save on money), so I cut the sugar back by half. I also used all whole wheat white flour. My batter was a little dry so I threw in one more mashed banana--could be because I used all whole wheat white. I got twelve biggish muffins and one small \"gift\" loaf pan out of one recipe. Awesome basic banana bread that is full of flavor and the plain yogurt gives it a nice little twang. This was quick to make and will provide a nice snack/breakfast for tomorrow PLUS a nice random act of kindness for a special friend with the extra \"gift\" loaf. Thanks for sharing! NOTE: I didn't notice Rachel's review on her own recipe until after I'd made the recipe. For me, the amount of flour was perfect. If I'd added another 3/4 of a cup, it would really have been too dry. I'm not sure if it has been fixed since November, but as the recipe looks presently with 3/4 cup of each=1 1/2 cups of flour total, it worked out perfectly. EDITED: I've made this particular recipe many times now and it's always a hit with us here in my home but all my husband's family and coworkers love it, too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

Oh used mini pans (3 = 1 large) and time was 35 minutes. Cooled 10 minutes then wrapped and frozen immediately. We are making items for the county fair.
