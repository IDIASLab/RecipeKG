You can also use it to top ice cream. It's popular with banana-lovers young and old. This can be frozen, but it will darken. As written, it's fine, but you can experiment with spices too. Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, lemon/orange peel are all good candidates. Pick one or two for variety.",

My kids had some warm with Peanut Butter and Co's Bees Knees peanut butter for lunch and flipped for it. I liked that this was easy enough that I didn't have to babysit it I just had my son help me throw everything together with the pan and he was in charge of making sure it didn't burn. Nice way to use up ripe bananas. Next time I might add a mixture of cloves cinnamon and nutmeg. EDITED: You seriously can get by with 1/4 of the sugar called for. It really just depends on how ripe your bananas are and how strong your sweet tooth is. Now that I've made this a couple times I like to add 1/2 c. chopped walnuts after the boiling step.",
