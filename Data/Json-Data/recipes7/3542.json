Butter mochi is not the traditional Japanese mochi that you see in \"puck\" form, nor is it like Chichi Dango manju.\n\nButter mochi is of Hawaiian derivation and shouldn't be viewed as the same type of \"mochi\" that you may have had with your Japanese friends. It is in its nature to be more \"cake\"ish and is meant to be eaten in squares like brownies or lemon squares.\n\nSo, while you are correct that this is not \"mochi\", it IS Butter Mochi.",
