I used a gluten-free baking mix instead of flour. I also added (surprise) a few mint leaves to the blender my new fave flavor combo of strawberry/mint. I didn't have whole milk so I used 1/2 c strawberry honey yogurt and 1/4 c 2% milk. The consistency is similar to a ricotta cheesecake so I may try making it with ricotta instead of yogurt next time and increase the sweetness. Overall I thought it was simple and yummy.",

I like it with the 3 eggs as it seems almost custardy. I double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan. Any leftovers can be eaten cold straight from the fridge almost like a dessert. Can't wait to try a savory version as others have suggested (no sugar and cheese added). Very versatile recipe.",
