The mixture of fruits in this recipe was wonderful the color was off putting to my husband (as he doesn't eat things that are purple in color...weird I know) but it was enjoyed by all at our Easter brunch. Next time I make it I may garnish it with poppyseeds - just for an added WOW factor. Thank you Austin for sharing this recipe!",
