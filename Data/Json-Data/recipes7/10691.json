This was my first experience with spelt flour and it tasted grainy to me. However the flavor of the muffin itself was very good. I took the liberty of using the addition of sweet potato and dried plums since the submitter suggested possibilities of additions to this basic recipe. There is another recipe here submitted by the same person using sweet potato. The twelve muffins cooked up perfectly and took exactly 18 minutes to bake. I do think adding nuts to these would be wonderful. Thanks Mandi!",
