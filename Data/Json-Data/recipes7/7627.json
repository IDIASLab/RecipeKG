So I went to the handy dandy ingredients search and plugged in peaches and brown sugar. Wahlah! Peach cobbler! I had everything on hand to make this and just kind of eye-balled the ingredients to scale it down to 4 ramekins. The filling did spill over a bit (but I had put my ramekins on a cookie sheet - so no problem). I did end up turning the broiler on for a few minutes to crisp up the top crust a bit. Served warm with a nice dollop of whip cream! Yummo!",

I did turn the topping a few minutes in to moisten it and that really made a difference! I used the iron skillet and that worked well.
