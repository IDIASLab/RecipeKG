After reading the previous review and seeing that this was supposed to be turned out onto a wire rack to finish cooling I was expecting more of a cornbread consistency but I got something in between a pudding and a bread. Definitely too loose to dump out onto a wire rack even though the toothpick came out clean when tested in several spots after baking for the full hour. Will definitely not make again.",

I was going to serve sweet potatoes sweetened with brown sugar along with the ham, but was concerned this dish would make for too much sweetness on the table, so be aware of this possibility. I followed someone\u2019s advice on cutting back on the allspice, but next time I think I\u2019ll add the full amount. Also, I think this would taste better warm, not cooled off as suggested. I warmed up a slice the next morning and added some maple syrup on top for a tasty addition to my breakfast. With a little work, this would make a great holiday breakfast dish.",
