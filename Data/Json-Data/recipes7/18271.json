I probably used to big of a dish because I did not have enough cream mixture for the top. So I whipped another cup of heavy cream with a dash of vanilla, bit of sugar and a scant amount of expresso. It complimented the other two layers. I did use Chips Ahoy as someone suggested. They were perfect. This tasted perfect the next day if you can wait that long to try some. LOL",
