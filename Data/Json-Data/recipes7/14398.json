I would enjoy itself.\n\nI've never been a fan of flan, although a friend from the Philippines cooked some homemade flan that I enjoyed.  I'm amazed at how the flan batter sinks to the bottom of the pan and sets.  The flan layer possessed a nice, creamy sweetness that worked well with the chocolate layer.\n\nI could not find cajeta.  I attempted to make dry caramel, but it ended up being more of a Chernobyl experience.  I then made the wet caramel, but could not get enough out of the sauce pan before it hardened.  As a result, I felt like my cake needed twice the caramel I ended up with to equal what the recipe asked for.  A stronger caramel taste would have added a nice complexity to the taste.  A darker, amber caramel with a slight bitter flavor would balance the sweetness of the other two layers.\n\nThose who tasted the cake raved about it.  The response was more enthusiastic than anticipated.  \n\nOverall, it's a delicious cake that's easy to make, although people will assume it's much more difficult because of the flan layer.  Let them believe what they wish and take the compliments.",

                "reviewBody": "This looks & sounds delicious from watching the video. I won't rate it until I actually make it. BUT, my comment is about the breaking of eggs directly into your batter & the blender... Obviously you have never had the unfortunate experience to break a rotten egg, or worse, one with a partially developed baby chicken, into your work in progress! Both of these have happened to me from eggs purchased from well known grocery stores & aside from nearly barfing over it, also ruined the ingredients that I had already started preparing. Even if the least reason for breaking into another container first, just to prevent shells from possibly ending up in your mixture, it is worth using a measuring cup or other container for your eggs. Also, if you use a narrow edge of a bowl or skillet for cracking your eggs, you are more likely to cause bits of shell to end up in with your egg. Instead, crack them on a flat surface, then break them open with your thumbs. Learned these tips many years ago in my home economics class but it took those 2 awful experiences to drill into me about using a separate container for the egg before adding to the mix! Can't wait to try this cake!!! Well, dang it, I can't post without a rating so I'm giving it 5...",

I had made this before once in Mexico,  with a boxed cake mix, and it came out great, but I've since become sort of a baking purist and I like to make things from scratch.  So I tried making it with the Hershey's cocoa cake recipe, and  perhaps because that is such a runny batter, the pastel imposible didn't  come out right at all - the cake and the flan just mixed up and baked that way.  But now  this! I tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out perfectly!  I  followed it almost exactly -  the only change being  that  I used my own flan recipe, which has  6 eggs instead of 4, and a little  bit less evaporated milk.  It worked wonderfully.  Thank you!

The recipe as written made way too much to fit my pan. My cans of condensed milk were not 14-oz so it took 1.5 cans. I could tell after I put the cake batter in that it would overflow if I added all the flan mixture, SO, I spread some caramel in a 9\" loaf pan and scooped out some of the chocolate cake mix into there, then divided the flan mix between the 2 pans. I used the loaf pan as my \"tester\" this afternoon before I served the real deal to my dinner guests tonight. Baked at 325 in a convection oven in water bath. Loaf pan was done at 40-min; Bundt took 55-min. I put this in the fridge all day so it solidified. It tasted best cold. This was a very tasty, unique dessert. I used Smucker's non-microwavable caramel syrup, and drizzled individual pieces with extra syrup when I served them. My son didn't care for this, but everyone else did. Yum!!",

It seems the bundt pan I used may have been too deep making the cake thicker to the point it was not cooked long enough ( though it was an hour and the toothpick came out clean.) After taking the cake out of the pan (cooled for 45 minutes - too soon??) it began to fall into the center. So it looked bad and the flavor just wasn't great. Overall not worth all the time it took - thus the name - 'impossible'! Sorry I love to find great new recipes and give people good feedback - but not this time.",
