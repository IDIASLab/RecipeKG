So I ve posted a less than attractive photo of this tasty recipe. Next time I make them (there will be a next time) I ll upload a better photo. In spite of my screwing up Jenny s recipe they were easy to make and tasted wonderful. The store had Pillsbury Honey Butter Crescent Rolls so that s what I used. Decadent for sure but worth a splurge every now and then.",

As I read through the ingredients for this my brain was saying \"Don't do it!\" but I didn't listen.  I should have.  Think about it! Think about the amount of sugar in this thing (and sugar is one of my favorite food groups!) and especially the amount of liquid that is going to get poured over these strips of dough.  A cup of melted butter and 1 1/2 cups of soda!  I wish I had taken a photo, but didn't think to.  After the allotted time, plus 7-8 more minutes, they were still swimming in syrup and more like boiled dough.  After removing them from the pan there was still a good 3/4 cup of syrup and you wouldn't have wanted to add that on.\nIf you are still going to go ahead and make these, at least use some of the butter on the dough before sprinkling on the cinnamon.  It all wants to slide off as you roll it, and creates a dry surface that doesn't want to stick to itself to keep them rolled up.  And seriously consider cutting down the amount of sugar, butter and pop (remember, a can of Mountain Dew has 46 grams of sugar alone!)",
