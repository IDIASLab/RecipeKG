I may have overmixed the batter a bit and it came out well a little tough. Or was that intended because of all the liquids it would absorb? Anyway my first try did not result in a soft cake. THe coconut taste is there but not highly pronounced. My cake did not absorb the liquid very readily but it had already cooled completely before I was able to do that. Overall ok but if I do this again I'll go looking for a different recipe. Good luck to you!",
