Over the past 45 years I have probably made hundreds of apple pies but this one is just a treat! I made it as written. The process and the iron Skillet is the key to the finished product being so good. I like cooking with Iron cookware so I was delighted to find this recipe.  You may want to adjust the amount of white sugar you put on the apples between the layers. I cut it in half because I just know how we like things. It is super sweet no matter how much you put between the layers because of the butter and brown sugar on the bottom. Just adjust to your own families taste but do make it. It is a wonderful pie.",

I cut the sugar back (3/4 c. brown sugar on the bottom, and a scant 1/2 c. for the filling).  I also tossed my filling together rather than just sprinkling the sugar on top.  In the filling I added 2 T. flour and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I was unable to serve this right away since I was taking out to the guys, so my pan was one sticky caked-on rock-hard mess!  To clean the cast iron, fill 3/4 with water, add a couple of squirts of DISHWASHER soap (not dish soap), and boil on the stove for 10-20 min.  Turn off and let sit overnight.  The gunk will slide right off the pan in the morning.",

I have a really good Apple Pie recipe and I really did not want to try this because my other recipe is so good I did not feel the need to change it.

Well needless to say my son claims this apple pie is 10 times better than my usual apple pie...I did not even think it was possible to top my old recipe.  My husband was speechless after he tried it and later admitted it was the best pie he had ever tasted.  I finally gave in and tasted it myself and only one word can describe this....WOW!!!!  I will definetly be making this again.  Thanks for posting.  Word to the wise.  DON'T CHANGE A THING!  It's PERFECT as is :-)",

Also, the middle layer of crust did not cook all the way through and turned out mushy.  Lastly, this recipe could have used more apples easily.  In all fairness, I will say that the flavor of the apple filling was incredible!  To those considering this recipe, I would make the following changes just based upon my experience:  when melting the butter and topping with the brown sugar, do this cooktop and not in the oven.  When you lay down the bottom crust, push down well.   Otherwise, just omit the brown sugar.  Lastly, I would prepare the filling with the seasonings and refrigerate overnight.",

To it makes it easier\u2026  mix the sugar spice(they make an \u201capple pie\u201d spice that is excellent)and add \u00bd cup flour. Coat the apple slices in this before starting to layer your pie.  The first time I made this I used the recommended amount of spice and brown sugar, the second time I cut the brown sugar in half and doubled the spice, it was much better not syrupy, which my family prefers. I also doubled the recipe using 4 crusts and turned this into a cobbler, of course you have to double the baking time as well! EASY and is the best apple pie ever! Thanks TL Dixon, I love it!

I then added the apples that I gently mixed with sugar and cinnamon. I left out the center crust and topped it off with my own butter crust. Cut some slits, dotted with butter and sprinkled with sugar. After about 50-55 mins in the oven it was golden beautiful and delicious.",

Currently I use the double pie crust from King Arthur as that's my go-to baking site and I triple the recipe to make two pies. The French Pastry Pie Crust I mentioned and have used many times is very tasty but difficult to roll out. Original 2011 review: Oh wow this was amazing...best apple pie I have ever had! But how could it not be with melted butter and brown sugar at the bottom! Also since no one says it anywhere but I guess it's obvious use a 9 inch skillet. I think I used almost six apples too. Make sure you REALLY fill it as apples cook down quite a bit. I used the French Pastry Pie Crust from this site for the crust (that is the BEST crust!!)",
