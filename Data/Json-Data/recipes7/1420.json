I tried them with both walnuts and almonds... the walnut ones were richer and chewier while the almond ones turned out crunchier and a bit lighter. I prefer the walnut version. They were baking in the oven when my husband came home and he commented that they made the house smell heavenly. This will definitely be a staple for when I have guests - they're so fancy and gourmet-tasting with so little effort on my part!",

I ground too many walnuts so I added extra liquids - I must have added too much because when I took my cookies out of the oven there was one big cookie burnt on to my pan. So after playing with it a bit I found: heat the oven to 300 degrees; add extra nuts at least 1/2 a cup and no extra liquids. You MUST line the pan with partchment or at least tin-foil! - I thought I could get away with just greasing the pan as with so many other recipies. And finaly cook for only 15 to 18 minutes. Whew! Pretty good cookie after I cleaned up the mess and corrected my mistakes.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a excellent recipe and I disagree with the others who complained that the egg mixture is too runny or that there is not enough egg for walnut mixture. The trick is to beat the egg yolks on medium/high for 5 minutes until it is light and yellow and gradually add sugar. Then you have a nice white/sugar paste. Then I mix in the almonds. I use a kitchenaid mixture for all this mixing. I didn't have any problem rolling them into small little teaspoon size balls using my hand. A standard cookie sheet will fit 18 little dough balls. My mom is persian and she said these reminded her of the same cookies she had when she was a child. I used only 2 tsp of cardamom and omitted the rose water. Despite many persian recipes using rose water the authentic recipe does not call for it. I added 1 tsp of vanilla instead and the taste was perfect. I also think the baking time is too high and this will burn your cookies. I baked mine at 300 degrees for 20 minutes middle rack. Perfect to dip in tasty persian black tea!",

                "reviewBody": "I've made this recipe on several occasions. When the cookies turn out well they are scrumptious and are easily gone in two days. We refer to them as walnut lace cookies because they are light have a little crunch and are flavorful. But as other reviewers have mentioned I've have had my share of problems with this recipe. Three egg yolks usually aren't enough to make the batter stick (it hardly clumps together!) So I either add another egg yolk (making 4 in total) or 2 egg yolks and one whole egg. I also have major issues with the term \"finely ground walnuts.\" One time I pulsed whole walnuts in a food processor to create finely ground nuts; I ended up with one big runny cookie. Another time I lightly pounded whole walnuts in a plastic bag with a skillet; the end result was a slightly less runny cookie. So I now used chopped walnut pieces. My cookies aren't as smooth as the ones shown in the photograph but at least they are individual cookies. Also I think using a silpat pad works better than the parchment paper. As the recipe suggests do leave space between cookies because they spread and 20 minutes is indeed sufficient cooking time.",
