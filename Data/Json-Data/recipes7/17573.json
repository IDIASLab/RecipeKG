Unfortunately, this creates a very dry textured cake that even the applesauce can't moisten enough- we ended up throwing away both attempts (yes, I did it again because I wanted to be sure I hadn't messed something up the first time).  I don't know why because the recipe appears to be sound, but it just wouldn't work.  I would go elsewhere if this type of dessert is what you're looking for.",
