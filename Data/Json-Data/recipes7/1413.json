Per our family receipe when the cooking time was complete I pulled out the cookie sheets and turned each cookie on its side and baked for 10 more minutes. Then the same on the other side.

My first time making it but I've always loved it. Followed the recipe exactly except for sugar. Used splenda instead due to dietary restrictions; also used flour and corn starch because it's not Passover. These are great. I did slice them and put them back in the oven with the oven off for 10 minutes because I know they usually are baked twice. Great recipe. Will go into my rotation provided the rest of the family loves them as much as hubby and I. Happy New Year!",
