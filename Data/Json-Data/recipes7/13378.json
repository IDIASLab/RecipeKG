No one had rated this one yet so I took a chance. This was absolutely amazing! Possible better than the bakery. I didn't have half and half but milk seemed to work fine. Half of the batch I made just like the recipe and the other half I added chocolate chips to... both were great! I make my own fresh pumpkin and it tastes so much better than canned. I can't wait to make more and share them with family!",

I didn't have any shortening so I used 6 tbsp butter. To offset this change, since sometimes my baked goods spread or are flat when using all butter, I added about 1/4 cup flour. It turned out fantastic and I don't think made any difference.\n\n2. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract to the wet ingredients. \n\nI had some leftover cinnamon icing (1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp milk or to preferred consistency) I drizzled on top while it was still warm. So yummy!! This will be my go-to fall recipe!",

Used a scone pan I was wanting to try so I greased it with butter and baked for  about 25 mins at 400 degrees.  Made 1/2 the glaze and they were fabulous! Great recipe!",
