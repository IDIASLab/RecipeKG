Also, we didn't have time to put the dough back into the refrigerator.  The apple mixture was made ahead of time and we spooned it onto our dough and followed the instructions for sealing the tarts.  We used 7\" glass pie dishes, ungreased, and put two tarts in each dish, back to back.  After baking, they slid out of the dishes just fine.  Oh, what a lovely taste!  I am officially abandoning my grandmother's excellent pastry recipe for this one instead.",
