Neither my daughter or I had ever had Swiss Steak but it is something that my hubby had once and requested I master (LOL). I made both noodles and mashed potatoes to see which we liked better and they both liked the noodles better but I didn't care either way. Here are the ways I changed it up though and it worked for us... I deglazed the pan after browning the meat with beef broth and added about 1 cup because my hubby always likes extra \"sauce\". It was still really skimpy on sauce and I started to worry about the tomato to beef flavor ratio so I added 1 - 15 oz can of tomato sauce. It turned out great and my hubby and DD requested to have it again soon!:o)",
