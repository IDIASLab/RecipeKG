The first time I made this I left the skins on which gives the mousse a lovely mauve colour however they needed to be strained out and that was a lot of work. So seeing that they are so soft I was able to remove the skins before cooking. To get the colour I poured a half cup of hot water over the skins/pits and drained it off and after sitting for a half hour. I used this to dissolve the gelatin. My husband is crazy about this dessert. I'm glad for a way to use up so many plums at one time!",

                "reviewBody": "Rather than cooking on the stove I cooked the plums on high for 3 minutes in the microwave. To lighten a bit I used Splenda granulated and fat-free evaporated milk. It took about an hour for the plum mixture to start to thicken (not 30 minutes). I whipped the milk for about 5 minutes and it never really thickened. Little confused that it says to \"gently spoon the whipped milk into the plum mixture\" and then the next step is to beat again with an electric mixer?? I just dumped the plum mixture into the whipped milk and then beat it. Not to worry really because it all came out good in the end. In the future I most likely will chop the plums rather than slice (beating the slices was sort of strange) but we liked this dessert. For anybody following Weight Watchers Plus the subs I made take this to a 2 point dessert. And it's a nice one. Thanks Kellie C for sharing your dessert. This has been in my AR recipe box for nearly a year and I'm glad I finally gave it a try.",

I cooked the plums much longer removing the skins along the way and used regular evaporated milk -- no fat means no texture when you whip it. I also chilled the bowl first just like when you whip cream to make it as light and airy as possible. Next time I think I'll cut the lemon juice by half it doesn't need that extra tartness and I want more of the plum flavor to come through. I may also try reducing some of the plum juice or even use that instead of water for the gelatine.",
