But I made a Lemon Buttercream frosting instead. I made these for my daughter's birthday as carrot cake cupcakes are her favorite cupcake. As far as the cupcakes themselves go in this recipe my hubby & I thought that they were just ok. We didn't think they were anything spectacular. But once I added the lemon flavored frosting to them that took the cupcakes from ok to really good. We had NONE leftover from her birthday party because everyone took multiple cupcakes home. I would recommend this recipe if a lemon flavored frosting is used. Unfortunately I can't recommend this particular frosting as I couldn't make it. I do plan on trying it though so don't let my review discourage you from trying the frosting in this recipe.",
