Instead of laying the graham crackers flat I ground them up and added some brown sugar. I accidentally added all 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar to the pie filling so then I still had to go in and add the other 1/2 cup to the sour cream topping. It turned out great though. I think the next time I make it I will probably add regular whip cream on top of the sour cream topping!",
