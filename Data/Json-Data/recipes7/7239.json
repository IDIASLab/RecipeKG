Great cake \u2013 moist, pleasantly spiced with cinnamon, with no shortage of blueberries for sure.

I substituted butter for shortening (the same amount) and instead of sour cream, I used 1 cup of vanilla yogurt. \n\nIf you plan on doubling the recipe, I suggest baking it on 325 instead of 350, as it is a denser cake. \n\nWill definitely be making this again! and again and again and again :)",
