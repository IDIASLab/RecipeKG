You do have to be careful with the broiling- I did not spread to the edges as directed thinking it would spread itself under the heat but it did not and a few did turn dark in that area so I would advice spreading it out to cover the whole thing.",

Hints: Use the cinnamon in the cupcake bottom otherwise they're boring. Make sure you butter is warm enough to cream with the sugar. Lumpy cake batter is going to make your cupcakes a crappy texture. For the topping you can spread it to the edge if you want the topping to melt into the paper and then catch on fire (extra hint: you don't). If you grease the cupcake pans you can spread the stuff closer to the edges. If you don't use walnuts (which you should they were super-yummy) add more coconut otherwise your topping will be a little too... buttery. YUM YUM",
