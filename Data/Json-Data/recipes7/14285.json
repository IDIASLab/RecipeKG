I did not peel or salt the eggplant- not necessary in my opinion. Used fresh, not canned tomatoes because it was what I had on hand. I wasn\u2019t sure about the celery, and I thought last time I made caponata I used red pepper, so I did 1/2 c of celery and 1/2 cup red pepper. I used less oil than called for, seemed like a lot. I used 2 tbsp and added an extra tbsp of tomato paste. I added fresh basil (chopped), and assumed the author meant for dried oregano, not fresh. Lastly I used less vinegar than called for, and even at that I felt it overpowered. As a result I needed to add about an extra 1/2 tsp sugar and a bit more salt. With those changes, I thought this was quite good both warm, and even better next day.",
