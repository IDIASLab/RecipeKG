Since coconut is the new miracle food I used 1/4 C coconut flour (the fiber in it is supposed to be especially good for your digestive system) 1.75 C gluten-free flour. I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C coconut oil (since coconut oil is supposed to be really good for your brain cells and I need all the help I can get). I boiled three medium carrots figuring they'd easily make 1 C once mashed -- they only made 3/4 C so I was a little short on the carrots. Finally I reduced the coconut to 1/4 C because I was afraid that with the changes I'd made the coconut flavor would be overwhelming if I didn't. The cookies were really good; light and cakey. Hubby loves them and told me he wants me to make them again.",
