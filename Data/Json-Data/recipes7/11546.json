While cooking I played with the temperature a bit. At exactly 350 degrees the cookies came out with a beautiful glossy cracked pattern and a brownie-like texture inside. When I dropped the temperature to 325 degrees the cookies lost that. They looked softer and just not as pretty of a presentation. It was an excellent reminder to me that when baking cookies correct temperature is really important.",
