I don t have a scale so I simply generously covered the bottom of the cake pan with rhubarb that I had sliced inch thick resulting in 2 cups of chopped rhubarb. In addition only cup of sugar was needed to coat the rhubarb. The baking time for me was 45 minutes. What I loved about this dessert was how pretty the cake appeared when inverted. The top looked like little jewels. The cake is delicious on its own but I loved it served with whipped cream.",

I was pretty sure that this was too much fruit so divided it in half ( I had already spent too much time going from neighbour to neighbour to scrounge fruit) and doubled the batter and made 2 cakes out of it. Cake was good but maybe after all the effort I couldn't help but be let down. I wish someone else would measure out 4 pounds. The reviewer who covered an 8\" cake pan didn't come close. I probably won't make this again.",
