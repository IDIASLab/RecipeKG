My oldest gave it a 4, while my middle daughter and my hubby gave it a 5. I'd never made this kind of bread. The recipe was very easy. It wasn't sweet, but was like a light biscuit bread. The raisins made it sweet. Can't say it was the best bread but can't say it was the worst either. But what I can say is that it was okay, but this batch needs to be divided into 2. The reason I say that is because It's so dense, that the bottom center never got completely baked even after it was in the oven an hour and 15 minutes. While it looked pretty, it was to thick. 2 smaller round loaves would have been better for the baking process. But I think in my own preference. To improve this better for my taste. Add just a hint of cinnamon to it. But it's an okay bread.",

I followed the recipe and directions exactly except I didn't have a 9-inch round cake pan. Instead I used a round casserole dish the same size. The finished product is beautiful rounded and golden brown. Once it cooled I sliced it and it slices beautifully too. However the texture is not like any soda bread I've ever had before. It's more like a muffin or quick bread. It's a little bit sweet too. I think it would be marvelous with peanut butter on it and I will definitely make it again. I just won't plan to serve sandwiches on it. It would be lovely toasted with butter & jam with hot tea also!",
