I wasn't sure what to saute the onions and celery in, so I used some of the bacon grease and that added great flavor. I also reduced the salt a bit, but that was a personal preference. This came together very easily, and, in fact, I made it earlier in the day and just refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it. This was a nice twist on the usual German potato salad, and one that I will be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I think I would have preferred to boil the potatoes first, and then cube them.  They got a little mushy by cubing then boiling. The sauce mixture was a nice amount for 4 cups of potatoes.  I used white cheddar cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I think this will be a recipe that the leftovers will be even better than the first time around.  My DH wishes I would have  saut\u00e9ed the celery and onions a little longer as he didn't appreciate the crunch in the dish.  We both liked this dish and I would make it again.  Thanks LizgraEva for sharing your version of Hot German Potato Salad.",

I am unsure what the problem is because I like German Potato Salad and I like all the ingredients but it just didn't work for us. I think we would have liked it better without the mayo hot or without the cheese cold. It was interesting to try though thanks Lizgra!",
