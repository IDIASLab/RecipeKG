However I had to use plain Greek yogurt and a splash of vanilla due to not having the vanilla yogurt. I used brown sugar and 3 ice cubes instead of 5 because my bananas were frozen. I was looking for a high protein low calorie treat and chose this. After I made it I realized it was 4 servings and not 2. I poured it into 2 glasses and was lucky to get 1 cup each. I still would make it again but probably save it for morning. ty",
