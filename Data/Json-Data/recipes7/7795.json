I didn't put salt in the mix...just sprinkled with kosher salt before baking according to what I thought was the right amount. My oven only took 25 min. depends on your oven. I'm wondering if deep frying and then baking a few minutes in the spice mix would make a more sturdy fry. Worth a shot because they are tasty but very soft.",
