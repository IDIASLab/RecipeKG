I substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and have found that 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, and 2 tsp soy sauce is enough for this 8-serving salad. Any more and the lettuce would be dripping! The dressing IS important for softening up the broccoli, however, so I let it sit for 15-20 minutes before serving. Toss the crunchy noodles and walnuts in right before serving so the noodles don't get too soggy. Like other reviewers, I had no problem cutting the butter down to 1-2 tbsp when frying the noodles (which should DEFINITELY be broken into tiny crumbles), and toasting the walnuts in the oven. I've also thrown the walnuts in raw and I've never had a complaint.",

I halved the recipe but when I went to make the ramen/nut topping I accidentally forgot to 1/2 that lol so I just used the whole thing in there (it was sooo good that I didn't want to waste it!). Oh and I never buy unsalted butter so I used regular salted butter. I made the dressing earlier in the day in a jar and just shook it randomly to make sure the sugar was dissolved which worked out well and allowed the flavors to blend. Seriously I could've drank the dressing that's how good it was! This salad was just all around good...like you couldn't stop eating it good. I will def be making this one a lot YUM!
