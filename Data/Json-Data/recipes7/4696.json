First, I eliminated the sugar as I believe it would have competed with the savory ingredients in this muffin.  But more than that, let's just say I made and tasted these muffins a few hours ago and I still have an incredibly potent and unpleasant garlic aftertaste in my mouth.  I will warn Hubs to stay a foot away from me.  Frankly, they were also a little heavy on the rosemary too.  A subtle hint of both would have made this a much better muffin.",

The footnotes indicated other cheeses that could be used, I was out of mozzarella and opted for the cheddar. Also had some chopped jalapenos for added zing. I did cut the sugar down to 2 TBSPS and most likely will do without it altogether next time. I didn't care for the sweetness which seemed to be very prevalent right out of the oven. The next day they didn't seem as sweet though. All in all pretty good.",

I made a few slight modifications: used onion powder instead of fresh (about 1 tsp maybe more) garlic powder instead of fresh (1/2 tsp.) and ground rosemary (cut to 1 tsp b/c the ground stuff is so strong) For the cheese I used a Italian shredded blend (it was mozzarella asiago provolone etc). But I stayed true the recipe. This is a great recipe. Mine baked in 22 minutes directly in the tin (no liners). The result was a nice golden brown \"crust\" all around the muffin and tender moist interior. YUM! Kids and adults loved it. Will definitely make these again! Thanks for the wonderful muffin recipe!",
