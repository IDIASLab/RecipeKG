        "description": "Ana and Lydia's cannoli, recipe invented on July 31st, 2005. I spent a lot of time looking for a good recipe for cannoli shells and filling.  Since no two were alike, and since instructions were a bit sketchy, I worked with a friend to come up with a good recipe, including some tips that we came up with along the way. Special equipment is needed such as cannoli tubes, a pasta machine and a pastry bag to help make these cannoli come out just like the ones at Italian restaurants and bakeries. Start with 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar, and then add more to taste.",

My submission did not include the \"one cup of candied citron\"... I'll assume that the editors added this in error.  With regards to rolling the dough, I found that paper-thin was too difficult to achieve with a rolling pin and was happy to have the pasta machine available.  I agree with the previous review that if you don't get the pastry thin enough the results will disappoint.  I'm sure that those trying to tackle this type of pastry have their own tricks up their sleeves, eveyone finds their best methods.  I do hope that those few tricks I included will help first-timers get good results.  Good luck and good eating.",

Since I knew I was going to eat a cannoli, I wasn't to worried about the \"Healthiness\" of what I was eating, so I used lard instead of shortening... well because it makes everything taste better. By the way, trying to make this by yourself would be a nightmare. You need an assembly line... people will work for food! I call this the Italian version of the Tamale because the whole family has to help in this process. The one thing that saddened me was that when I stored them in an airtight container, the next day they weren't crispy like the night before =(, but my sadness was soon expelled with a little oven toasting, which brought them right back up to its fresh, crispy self!!

A bit tricky but not difficult to run through the machine.  After chilling the dough place a lightly floured board under the pasta roller attachment.  Large gumball size balls are pressed into a small pancake then patted on the board and run through the machine dusting with each increment of the rollers.  On my KitchenAid setting 6 is thin enough.  I lay the disc on the board and lightly oil a tube. (don't skip the oil) Lay the tube on one end of the disc and roll the tube.  When you reach the end dab egg white on the flap and finish rolling.  Lightly press the visible flap to make the line somewhat invisible and place in 350 degree veg oil for 2mins.  Remove with tongs to paper towels and repeat.  The previous rolls are cool enough to carefully slide off the tubes in 2 mins. I make only 2 at a time so there is a bit of a pace to keep up with the timer.  It will take about an hour to make 20 shells.  NOTE:  Handle uncooked dough with clean fingertips.  If your not organized you can get the pasta machine too dirty and difficult to clean.  I keep the oil a few feet from the dough.  I also made filling from cannoli-enterprises.com  Many recipes to choose from.  My fav has folded whipped cream. I'm just about out of characters so i will now say good luck and have fun.",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making cannolis for 30+years in our Italian family. This shell recipe is just as good as mine. I give the shells 5 stars. The filling is nothing like ours. I differ in the filling as such: I use ricotta used for pastries such as cannolis called IMPASATA RICOTTA .  This is what your bakeries and grocery stores in the bakery dept use. I find it in Italian pizza stores ask management to order. Best company to order from is Cisco Co but any will be good. It comes in 5 lb plastic containers and be frozen if necessary. If you do this I suggest make the filling first then freeze in batches for later use. To the ricotta I add confectionery sugar to taste and anise liquor to taste or rum liquor to taste but not both. No citron found most friends not Italian does not like. Then mini chocolate chips. Dip ends of shells in melted chocolate or gnache then in crushed pistachio nuts and enjoy.",
