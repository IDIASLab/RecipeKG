                "reviewBody": "I hate to rate this poorly. But there is something wrong with this recipe. As much as I tried to make it work...didn't happen.  I'm so sorry but, I made this not once, but twice. Both times, the baking was way longer, then the directions stated. 1st cake, as well as the 2nd cake, both were still raw at 55 minutes in the center. 1st cake was in 65 minutes total. And I gave up at 50 minutes with the 2nd one. Part of what I see is wrong, is that the batter is thin, not being able to float the ingredients evenly throughout the batter. The cranberries & the pecans, dropped to the bottom while baking, causing the bottom never to form and bake through. I made sure it wasn't the temp in my oven, with an additional temp hanging on the rack...and both my oven and the thermometer were the same temp. The cakes just didn't work well. I feel that the pecans weighted down the cranberries, the pecans should have been chopped and a least 1/2 the amount used. I was extremely disappointed both rounds. And what part of the cakes did bake, were over cooked and the cake fell apart with the bulkiness of nuts and berries. And possibly, to much oil.",
