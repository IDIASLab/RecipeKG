The starter had set for a day and a half before cooking.  Next time I'll leave them set for 3 or 4 days.  I do agree that the liquid measurement was way off.  I used almost 2 cups of buttermilk and about 1 1/2 cups of water.  They were still thicker like regular pancakes.  Not sure if I can keep the rest of the batter but I will certainly try",
