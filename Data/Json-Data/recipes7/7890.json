Everyone knows that when you put fruit and vegetables on direct or indirect heat they release their natural sugars making them sweeter and stronger. It worked for me. Oh yes! I also cooked the bananas with it too to release more of the sweetness in the bananas. This bread was heavenly. I will be making this again real soon.",
