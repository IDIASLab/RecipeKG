So I decided to recreate this traditional dish at home.  My husband says it's just like the restaurant...maybe even better?  Please note that some people like to eat the ginger, while others don't but like the flavor it gives off.  You can easily double this recipe to serve a larger group...plus it makes great leftovers.",

Try to ensure you buy the freshest ginger you can find this way it will not be stringy and you will find it very tender and pleasant to eat. We often put in so much ginger it is around 50% of the dish. Both fish sauce and oyster sauce vary greatly from brand to brand it is worth visiting a chinese supermarket instead of using the brands available in most supermarkets.",

I did not use the full amount of ginger because I did not have that much. I didn't measure it but I think I added 2-3 tablespoons. A full 1/2 cup would have been overpowering. I also did not add the bell pepper because we do not care for them. The chili paste I used was some I got from the Asian market so I don't know if it was Thai. We really enjoyed the results. It was pretty quick to make and would be great for a weeknight meal. Next time I may add more vegetables like carrots and broccoli.",

Instead of using Jasmine rice I used half of a 227 gram pkg of rice pad thai noodles soaked in hot water for about 10 minutes or until soft. I tossed the noodles and a couple of fistfuls of mung bean sprouts in the wok at the same time as the vegetables. I couldn't find Thai red chile paste so I used Thai red curry paste which provided a nice amount of heat to the dish. With the high amount of sodium in both the fish sauce and the oyster sauce there was no need to add extra salt so I omitted it. I didn't have any fresh cilantro but I did top the plates with some peanuts. Delicious and I'll definitely make this customized version again.",
