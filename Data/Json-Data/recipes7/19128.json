The only changes I made were using regular cream cheese and I added about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract(my grandmother's sweet potato pies always stood out because if it). I also made an orange glaze to top it(1c powdered sugar 3-5Tbls OJ). I'm about to make again for Resurrection Sunday dinner. This is a definite keeper recipe.",

The day after baking, the cake was good. 2 days after baking it was SPECTACULAR! I suspect it will continue to improve. Dense, moist and delicious, as a pound cake should be. I made a simple glaze to top the cake, which improved presentation but really wasn't needed. This recipe doesn't have many reviews but don't let that scare you away. It's a winner!",
