I also added one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and two teaspoons of cinnamon, as well as substituted vegetable oil with butter flavored shortening plus one tablespoon of vegetable oil. After making the batter I put it in the refrigerator and let it cool for an hour. Baking only took approximately 15 minutes. My end result was light and fluffy, and delicious. The only thing I wish was different was the fruit settled to the bottom of the muffin instead of throughout",
