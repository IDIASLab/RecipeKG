I used only 1 tablespoon not three. I tasted one of the first pancakes that were cooked and they tasted rather bitter so I modified the recipe by adding didn't measure anything cinnamon nutmeg and some agave. After the modifications it tasted much better. Before or after mods the pancakes were flat and almost crepes. I even added a smidge more baking powder just in case the 3 tablespoons was not a mistype. There was no difference in thinness either way. I don't think I will make this recipe again....instead I think I will just use my regular recipe and just add the chips to it instead.",
