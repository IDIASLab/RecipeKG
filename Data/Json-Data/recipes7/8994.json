I was especially fond of her cabbage salad. I could taste the ginger and asked her if she used any. She said that was the only way she'd make it and that was why hers was the best! If I asked, she'd throw in some extra chopped habanero for me. It was absolutely fantastic! So now when I make Jamaican cabbage salad, I always add ginger and lots of habanero. Too bad, I moved and found out she'd passed away. I don't even remember her name. RIP",
