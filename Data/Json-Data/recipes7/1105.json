I had to use quite a bit more sugar and cinnamon for the apples than it called for, then I had to more than double the topping.  I also used a gluten free flour blend (brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch) instead of straight rice flour.  The results were fantastic, and because I am gluten intolerant, I plan to use this topping recipe for all my crisps.  Very good, thanks for sharing!",

However, due to taste preferences & availability, I did make a few changes. Here is what I did...I used brown sugar instead of white... increased the sugar & cinnamon amounts, to better coat the apples... substituted oat flour (rolled oats in the coffee grinder - about 1/8 cup whole oats = about 1/4 cup flour) for the rice.... and I omitted the coconut! It turned out SO amazingly delicious!!! (and the family devoured it!) I will definitely make this one again!! ",
