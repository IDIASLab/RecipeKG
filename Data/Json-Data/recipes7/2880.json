Turns out after you make manti you bake it on 325 for 15 mins then boil for 10 mins. The dough should be close to paper thin like phyllo dough and they said they should be able to fit close to 40 pieces of manti into one spoon full..... That part kinda blew my mind. Had to 86 plain yogurt and sub it with ranch. 2 cups Tomato sauce with 1/5 cup butter and 3 Tbsp pepper flakes instead of oil. It came out pretty amazing S&P to taste. Going to try this one again and again.",

The dough comes out great. I used beef and added a little cream to the filling. Then I froze the dumplings for at least an hour. We always do it I don t know does it make the difference but I think it prevents from tearing when you boil the dumplings. The yogurt sauce is great for the dumplings although we didn t like the pepper oil (not hot and a little oily). Overall this is a great recipe.",
