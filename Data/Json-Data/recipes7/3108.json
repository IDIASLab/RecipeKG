I used frozen raspberries and a premium quality ice cream which made this super thick and rich.  Be cautious with the sugar - I think the amount called for is excessive.  I used just a sprinkle of Splenda. Hubs loved it, and welcomed the change from the fruit and yogurt smoothie he typically enjoys on weekends.",
