                "reviewBody": "The taste is good (or would be had I not taken it too far) and the texture is right. But a big word of caution here. First - use a big pot. The baking soda/vinegar combo will balloon this to about 5x its original volume. I used my biggest saucepan and I think next time I'll use the stock pot to be safe. And most importantly...there is no way this would ever really fit in an 8x8 pan. It blows up and even after I poured it into the pan it kept expanding. It ran over the sides which was fine because when it cooled it was easy to break off. But it would have been much easier if it were on a cookie sheet lined with heavy duty foil coated in cooking spray. Maybe not quite as thick in the end but I think it'd still be pretty thick. Anyway those are my recommendations. I'd been craving seafoam and this will do the trick!",
