While berries partially thawed (30 minutes the most) I mixed the egg brown/white sugars with sour cream and whole wheat flour. Let mix stand while slicing s'berries - cut each in half then sliced vertically. Laid s'berries in a GRAHAM CRACKER unbaked pie shell then covered with mix. Pie shell was full so I put cookie sheet under pie to prevent overflow in oven. Had a problem with the topping - too runny. Added 3 tablespoons of whole wheat flour 1 tablespoon at a time stirring after each addition. By the 3rd spoon mixture resembled course meal. Baked as directed. Three hours after pie cooled on the counter my tastebuds were begging for a piece to eat. Pie was good and crunchy! A little too sweet for me. Put in the refrigerator overnight and discovered the pie is not as sweet as earlier. Next time I'll try using Splenda or Apriva sugars. Enjoy!",

The strawberries and the yogurt (I used it instead of sour cream and light yogurt at that) and the whole wheat floor make it worth to be labeled healthy... there's almost no butter in the batter after all. I also had a puff pastry crust left over from another recipe and it worked absolutely beautifully. I guess you can substitute strawberries with any berries you like. Only little drawback I've seen prettier pies. A keeper anyway!!",
