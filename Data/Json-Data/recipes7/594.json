A little different because some of the ingredients aren't what you'd find in a 'normal' carrot cake.  My own MOTHER, who despises anything coconut, had two helpings for dessert and took some home!!  Don't knock it until you try it!!  You'll never go back to that boring recipe again.",

I made several changes to the original recipe (based on some of the recs) and it came out smashing... Split the flour 1/2 white 1/2 wheat... Split and reduced sugar 3/4c brown 3/4c white added 1c unsweetened applesauce and 1/4c oil to cut down on grease factor added pecans instead of walnuts (only about 1/3c smashed) and golden raisins instead of brown. I also didn't add the coconut (forgot!) and instead mixed it into the cream cheese frosting (also made with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and less sugar than recipe called for). The frosting was AWESOME... just let it sit for an hour or so to let the coconut flavor permeate. Also... use a hand mixer to incorporate the wet ingredients and MAKE SURE to DRAIN the pineapple very well by pushing out excess liquid in a metal colander/sieve.",

The only alterations I did was use half buttermilk and half oil and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and use brown sugar it came out moist and delicious, it cut down on sugars and fats. An excellent recipe, full of fruit and has a low GI rating, a healthy snack that I do not mind my children eating occassionally, with the above alterations, each slice (based on 24 slices baked in a large recantular tray) has under 1/3 ounce (7 grams) of fat! That is less than a granola bar. Thanks for the recipe!!",

It's heavy moist and a bit greasy. I followed the recipe to a T but omitted raisins as I despise them in baked goods. I'll try this recipe again but next time I'll use 3 cups of carrots and substitute a 1/2 cup of the oil with buttermilk or applesauce to cut back some of the greasiness. I think I'll use a smaller can of crushed pineapple as well since it's almost overly sweet and moist especially after topping with cream cheese frosting.",
