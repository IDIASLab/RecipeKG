Substituted old mushy bananas cuz thats what i had on hand and subbed in flour baking powder and baking soda for the bisquick cuz i didn't have that either. google \"bisquick substitute\" and it will pop up. or look for similar recipes- may seem common sense but there are new cooks on this site also. I would have included the measurements but I doubled the recipe and added tons of nuts and raisins and got 5 loaves so i prolly played with the measurements a bit. Used white sugar only cuz the sweetened condensed milk i used was actually called La Lechera (Dulce de Leche) which is a caramel flavor. Also subbed Butter Flavor Crisco for the butter again- cuz that is what i had! I added both walnuts and pecans and raisins as the last step before baking. For the new cooks put all nuts and raisins in a bowl with enough flour to coat all of them stir around with a fork and THEN add that to your wet batter. This very important step prevents your nuts and raisins from sinking to the bottom of the pan. Then i cooked at 325 for 1 hour and 350 for 10-15 minutes or so for a PERFECT BEAUTIFUL CRUST! Did it that way cuz my last quick bread burned around the edges and was dry. FYI i happened to have some whole wheat flour on hand that i forgot to put into the batter so i used it to dust my pans after I greased them. That really made a difference in the wa",
