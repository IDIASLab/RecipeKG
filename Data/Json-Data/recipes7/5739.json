                "reviewBody": "My grandmother would always make homemade lemon ice cream when she was alive.  Sadly, since she passed away no one has made lemon ice cream at gatherings.  To fix the lemon ice cream craving, I searched Allrecipes for a recipe that would give a strong lemon essence and...I found it!  I was momentarily hesitant to try it because of the low number of reviews, but with the high number of saves and the use of natural lemon zest/juice, I decided to try it.\n\nThis ice cream is AMAZING. It is so delicious and is better than anything bought in the store.  I only had 1/2 cup of the lemon juice, it was still very present in the ice cream!  My daughter, who loves lemons on their own, this is awesome ice cream.  She's eating a scoop right now trying to make it last.  I wonder how even more delicious this would have been with the actual amount of juice it called for in the recipe.\n\nThe only negative for her, but not for me, is one that is easily remedied.  She would have preferred less zest.  The zest is needed to give a strong lemon flavor but you can always strain it out after cooking if you don't want it in your ice cream.  (Think of it as lemon flavored coconut.)\n\nThis recipe is the only recipe I will use for lemon ice cream.  No artificial flavors or ingredients, just pure lemon deliciousness!",

This was BY FAR everyone's favorite. The tartness and creaminess are so delicious! I did strain the zest out, but I would definitely let it steep for awhile, as most of the flavor comes from the zest. Also, it would not thicken in the ice cream maker, which made me really nervous, but after 25 minutes, I took it out and put it in the freezer. After three hours it had set up so nice. It was almost like a gelato. I've already had requests to bring this one again for future birthday parties. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!\nUPDATE: I tried it again, and this time whipped the heavy whipping cream until the soft peak stage before adding, and that did the trick! It set up a lot nicer. YUM YUM!",

I made a lemon-lime version, using half of each.  Also, after juicing enough lemons and limes to get that 3/4 cup of juice I found I only had about half the zest required.  I wasn't about to have \"naked\" limes and lemons laying around, so I used the 1-1/2 T. of zest and called it a day.  It was perfect!  In fact, I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed this any more using twice as much zest and may even have enjoyed it less.  I loved that the recipe called for my preferred ratio of 2:1 heavy cream to half-and-half and, while I was a little concerned about how the added large amount of lemon juice would affect the mouth feel, I needn't have worried.  In spite of adding essentially 3/4 cup of \"water\" to the mix, the resulting ice cream was still creamy and rich, with no unpleasant iciness.  This tasted darn close to a Key Lime or lemon pie and I'm thinking some coarsely chopped graham crackers folded in at the end would be awesome good.",

                "reviewBody": "Fan flippin TASTIC! I have made this several different ways, beside just as written. It's great like it is, but we prefer to reverse the proportions of heavy cream and half-and-half, meaning one cup heavy cream and two cups of half-and-half. It's a bit less unctuous that way, with less cholesterol and fewer calories, allowing that fresh, clean taste to shine. It's still wonderfully creamy this way, and quite rich enough. I especially like to use Meyer lemons from our back yard, harvested just before making the base. Subbing 1/4 cup limoncello for 1/4 cup of the lemon juice keeps it scoopable right from the freezer. I have also steeped 1 cup of roughly torn basil leaves in the heated cream/sugar mix for an hour, straining the leaves out before proceeding with the custard. SPECTACULAR, as well as quite chic. We love it topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries. Any which way you make this, however, you're going to love it even more than you think you will. It's the type of thing that sneaks up on you. After it's all gone, you'll be pining for more.",

It was good. I'm glad others enjoyed it but I will not be making it again. It did not taste like ice cream but reminded me of lemon sherbet type thing.",
