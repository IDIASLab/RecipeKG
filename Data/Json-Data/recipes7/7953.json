This doubles well and honestly disappears in 15 minutes. My family loves this. It's a great substitute for people who love cinnamon rolls but don't want to spend the time to make them.",

The \"Grands\" are too big and still taste too savory.\nLast...I would skip the bundt pan and put it in a glass 11 X 17 pan.  I read reviews complaining of uncooked dough, and by switching out pans, I had no trouble with the 28-32 recommended minutes.",
