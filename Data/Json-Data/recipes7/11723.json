For those who enjoy sugary snacks, this is probably not for you. Its mildly sweet and like i stated, much healthier for you :)",

I tripled the recipe so I can individually freeze them for the kids to have a quick and healthy breakfast. They turned out moist and fluffy. Not as dense as the other pics I saw (perhaps because I almost doubled the zucchini and apples)? Absolutely perfect. I added raisins of course.;) Thank you!",

Second batch became whole wheat with sugar reduced to 3/4 c demerara sugar, added cloves, ginger and nutmeg, an extra scant cup zucchini, and an extra egg. This is now my go to recipe for zucchini bread and will make a batch of chocolate ones with the leftover zucchini.",

We both said they taste good and they're soft and moist. They need to cool fully before eating so they won't stick to the muffin papers. I agree that adding chopped walnuts would make them better.",
