But I was struggling with getting it \"just right.\" This recipe was spot on! I substituted half of the vanilla extract with hazelnut extract to create my favorite flavor. The results were excellent. Farewell, store bought creamer! (One tip: I have a Bella Cucina, which is like a \"Bullet\" blender, and that worked perfectly for mixing the ingredients together and achieving a smooth consistency.)",
