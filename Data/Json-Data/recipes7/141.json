I didn't really get the rise that I wanted for it to be fluffy instead it was a bit dense but soft. I couldn't get 15 pieces from the flour amount listed. I got at least 10 small ones. Also I did put more work to this in forming a traditional dough to get that swirl pattern when you bite to it: roll out the individual doughball until you get a thin dough circle brush it with shortening or softened butter roll it up into a swiss roll let it rest/rise for awhile then gently form a loose coil.",
