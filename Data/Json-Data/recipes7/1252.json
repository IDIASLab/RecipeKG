I only used a couple of tbp for a light coating (just roll the cranberries in it as you would the sugar but lift them out w/ a fork) to avoid excess. I tried using that pretty decorative sparkly sugar, thinking it would be best for this recipe but I was wrong. Hey, it happens! LOL Regular granulated sugar tastes best, looks best & isn't sticky (the sparkly sugar didn't coat completely while the granulated did). I layed them out to dry on a rack over a cookie sheet. They're beautiful! Thanks KF1065! UPDATE---Just wanted to give y'all a heads up not to keep these in an airtight container. (at least ones made using the corn syrup) They lose their frosted sugary coating & get kinda gooey.  The ones I left out in bowls are still perfect. My grndkids loved these & insisted on taking some home.",

I needed one little extra thing to add, and I stumbled across this recipe. It's easy, inexpensive, they look festive & beautiful, and taste great!!\nA second note on these-- I made my first batch last weekend as a trial batch. I bought fresh cranberries from the produce section and let them chill in the fridge for a couple of hours until I was ready to use them. Had no problems. Right now I am working on my second batch- using the extra bag of cranberries I had stored in the freezer. The package says you can store them in the freezer and not to thaw them before using. Well the cranberries are not looking great right now, the egg & water mixture got frosty and dried a little bit first and now sitting in the sugar the are thawing causing the sugar not to stick as well. I will have to periodicaly turn them over in the sugar to make sure they're covered while they dry. So it's safe to say-- for optimum quality, use only chilled fresh cranberries for this recipe.",

Just mix up 2 tsp of egg white powder with 2 tbsp of water and whisk until smooth. This worked great for me!",
