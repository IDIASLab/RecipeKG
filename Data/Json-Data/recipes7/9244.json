        "description": "Years ago I worked in a little coffee shop. We had a powdered cocoa mix with spices that was called Mexican Spiced Cocoa. On the can were directions for mixing it with espresso to get Mayan Mocha. I fell IN LOVE with that drink and have been searching for a replacement ever since. The coffee shop inside Hastings has a similar drink, but won't sell the mix to me for home use. So I researched a little, tested a little, and came up with this. To serve, stir 1/4 cup mix with 1 cup hot water and stir.",

I substituted Truvia for the sugar to save on calories but otherwise followed the recipe except for giving it a little shot of whipped topping. I ve never had a cocoa-coffee drink with cayenne in it but I loved that little kick that it gives this drink. Honestly I seldom like any of these powder drink mixes that have instant coffee in them but this one worked for me. Who knows maybe even try it on ice for the summer.",
