Also, for those who like spiciness (as I really do); sprinkling a bit of red pepper flakes after serving really brings out all the flavors with a kick. Like I said, delicious!

Not enough seasoning or salt. Something was missing. I will make again but I'll figure out an easier method and use different spices. I did use parmesan and not cheddar. Maybe that was it. It just didn't rock our world. Thank you for the recipe and the idea of mixing the different varieties of squash.",

Overall I liked the flavor of the dish and found it to be a good way of using up spaghetti squash without the typical \"add spaghetti sauce and pretend it's noodles\" recipe (which I never really like as much as the real thing). \n\nI found in my attempt at this recipe that the onion and carrots were not cooked through after even 60 minutes in the oven. The crunchiness of the carrots and onions and resulting strong onion flavor detracted from the dish. My one suggestion for this recipe would be to roast the carrots and onion along with all of the other ingredients before chopping them and adding them to the top layer. It may help to put the carrots and onions under the hollow of the spaghetti squash or acorn squash in order to cover and steam them and avoid over-drying. I may also try cutting the amount of onion in half or cutting it in smaller pieces. I'll try it again with these changes and see how it turns out.",

I left out the carrots and onion although if I were to use them I would just roast them with everything else eliminating the need for another 45 minutes of baking. I also left out the cheese because it didn't make sense to me. Maybe I missed out on something amazing but I didn't want to risk it! After roasting I threw everything into an 8x8 put a generous amount of salt pepper and cinnamon on top drizzled with honey gave it a stir and baked for another 15 minutes. Came out delicious!",

I also probably doubled if not tripped the cinnamon and doubled the honey (in hopes to please the husband lol) we added the feta with 20min left instead of at the start of the final 45. Over all very good. a bit longer to do then posted as I had to put the sweet potato back in for another 20. though I had a ginormous spaghetti squash and it was a very large sweet potato. small butternut.
