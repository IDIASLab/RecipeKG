Whether for holidays or if I need a ticket out of the doghouse, my wife loves these and eats 'em about as fast as I can make 'em. Don't be scared, blintzes are actually very easy to make. They fill the house with a unique baking/frying smell which shouts, Comfort food is on the way! I hope you enjoy these as much as we do.",

In the filling I used only 2/3 C of cottage cheese (all I had left) and used graham cracker crumbs. Even with less cottage cheese I had a lot of filling left over and had to make a second batch of batter. Hubby and I thought these were really good. 22 month old didn't like them at all.",
