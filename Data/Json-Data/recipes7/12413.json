                "reviewBody": "It might seem like nit-picking  but after all, when ingredients for basic recipes (like biscuits) are essentially the same, it's the little differences that can make a recipe good or great - I'd make a couple of changes if I were to make these again.  A little salty, a little too garlicky and, and, I'm surprised I'm saying this since I'm not a fan of sweetness in biscuits, not enough sugar.  I'd increase the sugar by half, more if you like your biscuits a little sweeter.  I'd decrease the garlic powder by half.  I realize that \"garlic\" is in the title but it isn't pleasant when the garlic lingers on your palate long after you've eaten the biscuit!  The salt, rather than enhancing the flavor, was a little sharp.  I'd reduce that by half as well.  The cheddar, while okay as is, was a little much - I would have been happier with half the amount called for with that too.  As for mixing, it seemed to me to make more sense to combine all dry ingredients, including the garlic powder, and to combine all the wet ingredients - in other words, to mix the mayonnaise and milk together - and then add the wet ingredients to the dry.  I like shortcuts whenever possible, so  I made these as drop biscuits, using a 1/4 cup measure for each.  The recipe doesn't direct you to do so, but I lightly greased the baking sheet with cooking spray.  Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter.",
