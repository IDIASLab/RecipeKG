Spreading as thin as they say is important so they aren\u2019t more doughy than crispy (like you want them). Next time I\u2019ll cut squares deeper too. Makes dividing them up easier after they\u2019ve cooled down. Be sure to use a larger cookie sheet! Will definitely be making these for a quick yummy treat! This is a keeper!",
