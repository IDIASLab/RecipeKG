These come very close to my Grandmother's! I used a full cup of raisins and doubled the amount of sugar because I like my tea biscuits a little on the sweet side. I also used half and half vs. milk. After I cut the biscuits, I let them set for 30 minutes to let the baking powder \"react\" in order to get them big and fluffy. After I did the egg wash, I topped them with a bit of turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. These came out moist, light, fluffy, and simply delicious - perfect with a cup of tea! I have also made these substituting the raisins with miniature chocolate chips or dried cranberries. Thanks What's for dinner, mom? for a great recipe - my Mom (Nancy) requested these while she was in the hospital and I was so happy to have been able to make them for her one last time....",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe duplicates the Tea Biscuits we find at our local grocery store.  They are not very sweet.  My husband prefers them to the bakery style that have more sugar and vanilla.  If you prefer a sweeter biscuit then up the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Add in 1 tbsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp lemon or orange extract.  That will give you the bakery style. Those are my favorite :)  --The original recipe was for lactose free biscuits.  In order to do this I used vanilla soy milk or almond milk.  I also use Fleishmann's margarine as it is parve.  I also used dried cranberries in place of the raisins for this batch.  YUM!  On the days where lactose is not an issue - I have also tried using buttermilk and found it to work very, very well! **********8/15/10 -Made these in my new biscuit cast iron pan - really easy!  I preheated the pan and when the dough was ready I skipped the rolling stage and simply scooped about 1/2 cup of batter into each of the little pans.  They baked nicely and in a uniform size AND without all the extra work of rolling them out, getting a biscuit cutter, re-rolling scraps and lessened the clean up which was a big bonus.  I did pat the dough down to make the tops smoother and topped with cinnamon sugar - no egg wash this time.  I am very happy with the results so if you have a scone pan, large capacity muffin pan or a cast iron biscuit pan - give it a try!",

I made these with the extra raisins and sugar mentioned in Jillian's review and they were delicious! I used half butter and half 'smart balance' cuz it has some health benefits and I could not be more pleased with the results. Will definitely make again and this was so easy I am inspired to try making plain biscuits too. Highly recommend!",
