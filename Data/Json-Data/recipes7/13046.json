Without the additional coconut flavor, they have the faint aroma and taste of coconut thanks to coconut flour. With the flavor, you'll have a cookie with robust coconut taste, perfect for dunking into a pot of chocolate fondue or glass of milk.",

I used vanilla instead of coconut flavoring. Can't wait to try them with the coconut flavoring or a little lemon zest. Also used raw sugar instead of refined. And I used a small melon scooper to drop, which worked great. Will definitely make again. And will double the recipe. This recipe only makes about 12 small cookies. They were good enough to want more.",

They came out quite tasty, and not as sweet as expected. They could use a little vanilla extract or almond extract for a bit more flavor.\n\nI made another batch with the same coconut flour and Bob's Redmill All Purpose Baking Flour (blue and white bag). I added 1 1/2 Tsp of cocoa powder and used 1/4 cup of lightly packed dark brown sugar. I may have also used a bit more than 1/4 cup of butter since I estimated and didn't measure exactly. I also added a tiny bit of fresh orange zest to the tops of each cookie before baking. The dough was delicious so I imagine the finished product will be quite tasty. Because of my oven, I have had to bake them 12-15 minutes.\n\nJust tried the chocolate cookies and they are better than the plain ones. Definitely an improvement to use brown sugar, cocoa powder and orange zest.",

Like several other cooks, I added vanilla rather than coconut extract (1/2 tsp), substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar,  and used coconut oil rather than butter.

Make sure you really get the cookies about 1/4 thick--if you try to bake them like round drop cookies, then it won't work.
