I wanted mine to be completely fat-free though, so I substituted fat-free half & half for both the skim milk and the heavy cream used in this recipe.  I made an additional tweak by substituting the Splenda for all the sugar called for.  For flavor, I scraped the caviar out of a whole vanilla bean into the cooked cream portion and added 1/4 teaspoon of almond-vanilla powder to the milk-gelatin portion.  Topped the desserts with fresh raspberries.  It came out super creamy, flavorful and neither my boyfriend nor I missed the fat or calories at all!",
