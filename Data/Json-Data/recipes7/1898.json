No caviar here but we even enjoyed these with just a touch of butter which surprised my family (they are used to all buckwheat pancakes with caramelized apples and with those pancakes the apples are a must because the flavor of the pancake is quite strong and we are not accustomed to buckwheat on its own). With this recipe however the flavor of buckwheat is rather mild probably because of the white flour. My family still loved them with apples caramelized in butter and a touch of sugar but enjoyed them with smoked salmon as well. I'm sure that syrup would be good and since we had leftover batter I suggested that we could make up the leftover batter in the morning and serve them with syrup. Then my 16 yo son promptly said \"No just butter thanks!\" --- WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS GOING TO HAVE TO COOK THEM BECAUSE SCHEDULES CHANGED I ADDED MORE FLOUR since he was a bit put off by the thin nature of the batter. They still came out nicely. I wish I had simply added extra flour to SOME of the batter so I could have at least tried the Blinis according to the recipe. I'm sure they are really nice if made as per the recipe. I'm sure that the flavor would be no different..... OH WE FOUND THAT A LOWER TEMPERATURE WAS NOT AS LOVELY BUT PRODUCED A MORE TENDER CAKE....... depends on what you are looking for........ so just sayin'......",
