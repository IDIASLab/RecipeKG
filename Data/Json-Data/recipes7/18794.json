I made 2 minor changes: 1) Reduced cook time to 45 minutes - glad I did as it was perfectly done by then and so moist. 2) Used 2 tbsp almond milk instead of heavy cream in glaze. Next time I'll just use 1 tbsp as I had to add a bit more icing/powdered sugar to thicken it up. Fantastic recipe - it's getting added to my regular rotation. Thank you Kim!",

Because I live in a dry country in Africa, I do have to make some substitutions based on available ingredients. I made this non-alcoholic by using 1/2 teaspoon almond extract in a third cup of water instead of amaretto. I added a few drops in the icing as well. I used creme franchise instead of sour cream.\nThis was well received by all my guests, many asking for the recipe. This is definitely becoming a regular recipe to take places because it is delicious and very pretty with almond slices and cinnamon sprinkled on top of the icing.",
