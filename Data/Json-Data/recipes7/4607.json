I used a 32-jar of sauerkraut a golden delicious apple no juniper berries no pork chops and no fresh parsley. Instead of making a spice bag I just added freshly ground black papper one shake of ground cloves and a teaspoon of dried parsley flakes directly into the pot. I used hot dogs for the meat added the cooked bacon and used about 8 peeled and quartered red potatoes let it simmer about an hour and a half and it all came out delicious. Great recipe! Thanks 4Nancy! Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly.",

I omitted the apple and juniper berries and used ground pepper and cloves instead of whole. I put the chopped onion in with the sauerkraut sugar and broth and I crumbled the bacon and put it in 10 minutes before I took it off the stove. I think that I would make this again but without pork. It was very good with just the sausage and sauerkraut and potatoes. Also I looove the taste of sauerkraut so I think I will add more next time and omit the brown sugar to keep it tart.",

This simplified streamlined version was easy to prepare and a hit with both me and Hubs tonight. But I made it even simpler! First I had sausage on hand and that was plenty for us I didn t bother with the smoked pork chops tho they are definitely a worthwhile addition. I simplified the wrapping of the seasoning and aromatics by simply stuffing them in a tea ball. Finally after saut\u00e9ing the onions I threw everything in the Crock Pot except for the sausage and let it go for several hours. I used less broth than called for pouring just enough to barely cover the potatoes and sauerkraut along with a good glug of white wine (I used Chardonnay). I used every ingredient called for but skipped the apples as both of us were good without it. An hour before I planned to serve dinner I tossed in the sausage some nice knockwurst from Milwaukee s famous Usinger s. This is a lovely full-flavored and satisfying dish. It also works well using a variety of meats and sausages but traditionally it all must be pork!",
