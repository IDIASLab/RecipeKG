For the bread I omitted pudding mix used half white and half white whole wheat flour 3/4 cup sugar and 1/3 cup each applesauce and canola oil. We loved it! I made half of the batter plain and the other half added apples and walnuts. I feel better with less sugar and oil and a bit of whole grain. Yum! I froze 3 bags baked with one and have one on my counter again to love for 9 more days.",
