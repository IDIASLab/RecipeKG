At this point I added 1/4 cup of plain breadcrumbs and the consistency was perfect.  Then I realized I forgot to add the egg white so I added only 1/2 of an egg white and it was way too wet.  It took another 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to thicken it back to normal.  I cooked it on a parchment lined cookie sheet on 350 for 30-35 minutes (can't remember exactly how long I set the timer for but you can tell when you smell them that they are done.)  I made them in walnut sized balls and got 23 balls out of 1 package of ground chicken.  I like the flavor and will make again.  I also liked adding the breadcrumbs too and it didn't detract from the flavor.  My husband dipped his in sweet chili sauce and I added mine to a soba (buckwheat) noodle bowl.",

An ingredient was left out for binding (oatmeal bread crumbs etc) or the directions are incorrect (heat to make the corn starch thicken?). On a 1 lb recipe I had to add 1/2 cup of quick oats and 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs to even come close to making a meatball. I served them with peanut sauce (a combo of recipes from here). They were really good - after the additions.",
