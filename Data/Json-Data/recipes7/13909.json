These are delicious, I used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the filling to add a little punch of flavor. I also learned that I should let the batter rest for 20-30 minutes, the first batch I put in the oven cracked, but the second batch didn\u2019t, so I\u2019ll be keeping that in mind for the next time I make these!!
