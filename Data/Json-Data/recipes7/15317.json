Perhaps they measured their flour wrong or cut into it too early.  I let a quick bread like this, any bread really, sit at least two hours before cutting into it.  It\u2019s still cooking when you pull it out of the oven and it will loose a lot of moisture if you cut into it while it\u2019s still warm.  Followed the recipe exactly but added a little sprinkle of sugar over the loaf before I put it in the oven for a little extra sweet crunch on top.",

Even though I used half volume of very good quality olive oil (and the remainder was 365 organic evoo) I didn't think the olive oil had too much presence. I used the zest from 3 plain navel oranges and added the juice from one. I put it in a tube pan and shortened baked for 30 mins (until insert came out clean). I think 40 mins would have been overbaked. I'll absolutely make this again. It's a great recipe.",
