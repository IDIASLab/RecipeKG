I served it in small antique sundae glasses & topped with a splash of cream 3 raspberries & a sprig of mint. All my friends were impressed & I raved about the fresh lemon flavor. Everyone wanted the recipe. I had no problems with it setting up. However as I was making it I thought it would be a great ice cream. Just cool then put in the ice cream maker. Even if it is a custard consistency you can still make ice cream with it. I might try this with lime too & serve it after a Mexican meal.",

Since the lemon, cream, sugar mixture is extremely hot as you pour it into your dessert dishes, I have thought of a safe way to put the hot dessert dishes into the fridge without getting burned.  Place the empty dessert dishes in a low sided baking dish or tray, when filling them with the posset mixture.  Once you have filled all of the dishes, pick up the baking dish and slide it into the fridge.  This way you don't have to worry about getting burned, from the hot mixture, when picking up each dessert dish and putting it in the fridge individually.",

It does soften rather quickly upon removing from the refrigerator, but I remedied that by freezing it for just a few hours before serving.  It doesn't harden too much, but stays firm much longer.  I did add the zest of one of the lemons, because it seemed to be screaming for that.  By the way, one recipe makes about 32 oz, which is helpful if you're trying to divide the mixture equally between serving dishes.",

I boiled mine for three minutes until it began to thicken on the sides of the pan but given that there is no flour it sets into a thick creme rather than a custard even after leaving it overnight. The recipe gets four stars for specifying number of lemons rather than spoons or mls of lemon juice because the size of people's lemons can differ. This may be the reason why people were complaining the recipe is too tart or sweet. To overcome this simply taste the mixture as you add lemon juice and adjust accordingly. I added vanilla to mine- you could add a vanilla bean at the beginning I didn't as it was the first time trying the recipe. Some people suggested using lemon zest- I do not like the \"marmalade effect\" so I put two strips of peel in at the beginning so I could extract the lemon oils and then easily fish the peel out when I added the juice. I will try this again with different flavours such as lime or orange with a spoonful of cocoa (chocolate-orange creme). It would also lend itself well to floral notes such as a hint of rosewater or for something really unique pandan extract which I have used successfully with lemon yoghurt. Maybe orange blossom water or limoncello would be nice too.",

When I first tried it, it was WAY sweet and I almost threw it away. Someone suggested to me to freeze it, which I did and found it much more edible.
