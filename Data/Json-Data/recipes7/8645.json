These are high in fiber and flavor with whole wheat flour, flax seed meal, and wheat germ, and are quite delicious and filling. Serve with homemade blueberry syrup, butter syrup, yogurt, peanut butter and honey, or fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Make a huge batch with a mixer and freeze the uneaten waffles for easy weeknight meals or quick and hearty breakfast warmed and crisped in the toaster.",

I also used a homemade applesauce and regular whole wheat flour as I did not have pastry flour. I used a 1/4 cup dry measuring cup to drop the batter onto my waffle iron mine is smaller and 1/2 cup batter for each square is too much for mine. These cooked up fluffy thick with a nice chewy interior and a crunchy outside. The flavor was amazing--I've never had waffles like this before. I served this with a homemade maple-vanilla syrup and the whole family inhaled them. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: Even halved this made a TON of waffles. Keep that in mind when you make this if you don't have a large family--be prepared to freeze a few.",
