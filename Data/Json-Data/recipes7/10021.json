If using cinnamon it tastes more like an apple pie.  USE NUTMEG!)\nIf you're looking for a good pie to use up all those pears with, try this one.  You won't be disappointed.",

I used 2 cups pears, 1 cup blueberries, and the juice of one lemon(I don't know why- just seemed like a good idea- cut the sweetness a little?).  Also, I didn't have any sour cream, so I used the 2% plain greek yogurt I had in the fridge.  Delish!  We loved the sort of custard like consistency of the filling. I am not much of a baker, but, will definitely make this again!  I might try it with other fruit next time-apples and raspberries might work well, too.",
