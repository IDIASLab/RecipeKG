My recipe goes into the microwave uncovered for 13-15 minutes. If you use pumpkin instead of the potatoes be sure to let it cool off a little while because it will \"weep\" if it's still too hot. This is great as a side dish or dessert and is just like pumpkin pie but without the crust. You don't even notice the spices are missing! Thanks for posting jaqpink. I live in mortal fear of losing my recipe!",
