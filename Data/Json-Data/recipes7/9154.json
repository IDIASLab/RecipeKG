First I never use softened water (it seems to keep the jello from setting). Next the evaporated milk must be well chilled. (or it won't whip up correctly) Then the jello mix must be \"partially\" thickened in the fridge. I stir it every 20 minutes or so to keep it evenly chilled but not hard on the edges. It's ready when it's the consistency of egg whites. Whip the milk on high until it's huge and pretty stiff. Then I add the jello mixture to to milk and keep whipping. Once the color is pulled through the milk it's ready for the crust. (If the jello is too thin it will sink to the bottom. If the milk too liquid it will never set up.) If it doesn't set you can always throw it in the freezer.",
