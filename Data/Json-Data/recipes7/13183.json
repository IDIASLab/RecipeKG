        "description": "A low-cost spicy sauce with strong flavours and a silky texture. It does take a little time to make but the quantities yield 8 servings so that you can refrigerate or freeze the rest. Works great with dried pasta! It is the outcome of three years of trial and error, and I feel like I no longer need to experiment with the ingredients and method. If you're looking for a basic sauce which will allow for the taste of fresh pasta to be more up front, then this sauce might not be for you. To be served on a bed of your favourite pasta, topped with a few fresh basil leaves.",

It is absolutely delicious but she never had an actual recipe for me to go by... This recipe gave me a good base to work with and then I added and tweaked as I desired!:) I wanted this to be a meat sauce like hers but being a vegetarian now I instead added three packages (approx 2 lbs) of \"Smart Ground\". I also added more salt and paprika (not a big fan of the smoky type just personal preference) and some other spices that I like and let it simmer on low heat all afternoon stirring and adding water as needed. Served it over spaghetti noodles for dinner last night and my family LOVED it!! Will definitely be making this again and again! Thank you for sharing Patrick!",

In lieu of cayenne pepper I used red pepper flakes, which I sauteed along with the onions and garlic. I browned up a pound of sweet Italian sausage and added it in with the sauce, and I simmered the sauce for longer than the recipe called for to allow the spices time to really set in. Delicious!",
