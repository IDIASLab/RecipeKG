We used homemade plain yogurt instead of sour cream leek greens instead of chives and lime juice instead of cider vinegar. We also added in green chiles and red pepper to give it a pretty vibrant splash of color. We had too much of the suce for the amount of potatoes though so it was a little soupy. Next time I'll decrease the amount we made. Day 2 and we just finished it up. It's a good leftover!",
