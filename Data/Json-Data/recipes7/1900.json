I wouldn't call this a cheesecake at all. Even though it had it in there you could only taste that slightly. It was more or less....to me and my family like ice cream. I used my ice cream maker with this and it froze very well. It could go great by it's self in a bowl with a spoon or in a graham cracker crust but it melts fast too. So don't let it sit out long. Or you'll have a serious mess on your hands. My family liked it and said it tasted really good. And we had never tried anything like this so it was a total change of flavor for us. I had to double the batch because I didn't want to waste any avocados and we don't find 3oz pkg of cream cheese around here. Thank you I will make again.",

I made this tonight and because I didn't have an ice cream machine I followed the advice of some of the other members and froze it! After dinner and cleaning up the dishes I took the pie out and cut two slices for myself anf for my husband. We both enjoyed this so much and I have a feeling this won't last long! I used a prepared graham cracker crust that I had followed the ingredients and all I can say is WOW! The only thing I might do different when I make this again is probably add a little more cream cheese and perhaps some vanilla extract. I used light cream and liked the taste! The avocados I used were slightly over riped but they worked just fine. I will purchase fresh and ripe avocados the next time and really have great pie! Thank you for submitting this recipe! My grandson loves avocados and I do believe he will like this as much as we did! Thanks again! This is a keeper!",

That worked OK--I had thought the avocado might end up the consistency of cream cheese but it was chopped up into very fine pieces. I then added the cream cheese to the blender and that was a disaster. It really didn't mix with the avocado. I ended up dumping the mixture into a bowl and used a fork to mix it. I didn't use fresh lime juice so used bottled. I didn't have quite enough so added some bottled key lime juice. I poured the mixture directly into a prepared crust and put in the freezer. I brought it to a Christmas dinner. My friend really liked it and said it tasted like key lime pie. I concur. I don't know that I would make this again. I have made the Key Lime VII pie recipe from this site and that is easier and tastes the same if not better (although the VII recipe has more calories).",
