You'd think something as simple as apple pie wouldn't be as decadent or exotic as this, but you would be very, very wrong. I'm not a dessert lover but I took one of these home and ate it even after it was all soggy from melted ice cream and savored every morsel. There are no words for how good this is. This crust is to die for!",

I used green apples because I love the tang more and the lemon with this recipe made it absolutely perfect. There is A LOT of sugar used but it makes it pretty darn delicious.
