We let it sit overnight in the fridge and (as one reviewer suggested) let it set out for an hour to get to room tempreture before we baked it Christmas morning. Everyone really enjoyed it (adults and children) and it went well with the egg casserole. It almost tastes like pecan pie. We did use potato bread because I couldn't find the bread the recipe called for at our local market and we used salted butter and light brown sugar but those changes are minor the recipe is great and a keeper!

When I began pouring the syrup into the baking dish it just seemed like there was way too much like the bread would be swimming in it. I only used about 2/3 of the syrup. I used sliced slightly stale french bread and the amount I had was way too much for a single layer so I put two full layers of bread in the baking dish. I did add some cinnamon into the egg mixture. I followed others' advice and let the dish sit on the counter about 40\" before baking it. The cooking time was spot on the casserole wasn't soggy at all so next time I will cut back on the syrup quantity and use a double layer of bread again. Everyone just loved this dish and I will make it again and again! There was real maple syrup on the table some used it some didn't. Great stuff!",
