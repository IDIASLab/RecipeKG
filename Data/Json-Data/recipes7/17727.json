I did add a 1/2 tsp of salt to the dough and didn't use a full 2/3 cup of sprinkles (I didn't have enough). The dough was kind of sticky to work with so I refrigerated it for about 20-30 minutes and that helped quite a bit. I also used a medium cookie scoop and got 30 cookies--next time I will use a smaller scoop as the cookies were kind of big. Make sure to really flatten them too as they puff a lot in the oven. The sprinkles also kind of \"ran\" in the dough so it was weird color but still tastes good. I also need several tablespoons of heavy cream in the frosting to get a spreadable consistency.",
