I was worried it would be too sweet (and it was sugary) but it worked out really well in the end. YUM!:)",

I baked mine in the toaster oven but baked for 35 minutes rather than 25 and let rest for about 10 minutes before serving. It held it's shape great when served on the plates. My sweet potato hating husband asked if it was something pumpkin. I said \"yes\" and he really liked it and had 2 helpings. I will never tell him what he really ate! I love to try receipes from Indiana since that is where I'm from. This was a little on the sweet side but very good none the less.",

I subbed in walnuts being out of pecans it was just as good. In fact the topping was the best part of this. I cooked it for 30 minutes as it didn't seem to be set. It was runnier than I thought it should be with eggs in it. When I scooped out for plating the rest 'oozed in' to fill the void. Taste wise for me this just doesn't do it. Thanks for the recipe.",
