I pureed it a bit with my immersion blender, but the texture is a personal preference. The taste is what counts! I used homemade bread crumbs for the breading. I pounded out the chicken breast fillets a bit, and they were done in the 10 minutes stated. I liked not having to transfer it to the oven to complete the cooking and melt the cheeses. The cheese melted beautifully over the hot tomato sauce while the chicken was \"resting\". My husband raved! I'm throwing out all my other chicken parmigiana recipes. This one is it!!",

Then, I transferred it to a casserole dish, covered it with the sauce, and topped it with the mozzarella cheese.  I then covered it and baked it at 350 for about an hour and a half.  This worked out great for my situation.  ",
