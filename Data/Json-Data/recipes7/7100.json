It would make a great vegetarian soup. My adaptations, if you care, were: I used canned diced tomatoes as the base for the puree.  I roasted garlic, red and yellow peppers, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.  I had no onion to roast, so I used onion flakes when cooking the sausage.  I added some of the roasted vegetables along with the garlic to the tomatoes to puree.  I only had sweet Italian sausage, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it some spice (not needed, but I like spicy). Then I did the whole thing in the crock pot.  about an hour on low to soften the kale, and then about 2 hours on high once you add the veggies.  Add water, salt & pepper as needed.",

I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because it was all I had available. The mix of the beans squash meat potato broth and chickpeas is really good. And the kale... I like it! I never knew it until now. I will be adding this recipe to my list of things to make on a regular basis!! (Even if I don't get kale in my co-op box again!)

Do be aware that the 1-1/2 hour time is WAY low. I don't think I'm THAT slow. Maybe that time would be right with a hubby or someone helping with cutting and peeling but if you're doing it by yourself be prepared for it to take closer to 3 hours from start to finish.

The potatoes should not be roasted with the other veggies as the other veggies take longer to soften and the potatoes are left to mush. I never use Kale and did not realize you have to clean it first. The garlic is another ingredient that should not be roasted. I would make this again with the changes I now know but for others may not as the recipe was made with too many unnecessary steps...but I am a soup person and am always looking for another good healthy soup recipe.",
