I used no-salt canned tomatoes and white beans and added onions since mine did not have many. I omitted the rest of the seasonings since my collards had plenty of flavoring. I then added broth and water and turned this into a soup. This is definitely a recipe that can be used with leftovers. Great idea! Thanks for sharing!",

I followed the recipe exactly except I used an equal amount of frozen collards. For some reason after all of the cooking time I felt the collards still had quite a bit of a bite to them. I guess I will only use fresh from now on. I never tried the frozen before. After it was done it badly needed salt of some kind. I had some Adobo seasoning on my stove so I sprinkled some on. It wasn't bad but not a repeat a recipe. Just missing the texture and flavor for me. However a nutritionist would give this 2 thumbs up.",
