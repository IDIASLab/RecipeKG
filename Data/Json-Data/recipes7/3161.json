Very good and very filling - definitely makes enough for a crowd!",

I didn't cook this for as long as recipe stated, I cooked for 3 hours and by then my peppers were pretty much boiled down to mush.  This made for a delicious sauce but you'll have to add sliced peppers during the last 1-2 hours if you want any resemblence of them left.   :)",
