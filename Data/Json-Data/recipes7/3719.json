To ensure the sugar crusted on the rim I made these the evening before with red and white sugar crystal's and let them \"sit up\"! Preparing ahead of time allowed the sugar to last through more than one refill of champagne! Beautiful festive fun and turned an ordinary glass of champagne into a work of art. Guests definitely felt special when sipping these!",
