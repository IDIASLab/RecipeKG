Use your favorite.  I just happen to like homemade strawberry freezer jam.  Also, this recipe does NOT require the milk to be 2%.  Whole milk is fine.  And, for optional added elegence, you can use a creamed mixture of 8 oz cream cheese, (softened) 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  Beat until creamy and spread on roll before spreading jam if desired.  This creamed part is just a nice added bonus.  Sorry, I don't know why this were changed or left out of the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is perfect. If you have problems with breaking there are a few things you need to check or be aware of:  1. Using cake flour or a low gluten flour is best. If this is not available, add corn starch (1/3 corn starch to 2/3 flour). High gluten flour is good for breads and pizza dough, not jelly rolls.  2. Be sure you are not OVERBAKING the cake, this will dry it out and cause it to break. Try the lower end of the baking time first. Overbaking is the most common issue. 3. Roll the  cake while still warm, if you wait too long after removing it from the oven it will break.  If you do experience breaking while rolling, do not throw away your cake, cut it into petite fours and  fill them as normal. You can salvage what you have and make it useable and still yummy.",
