Use left over shredded zucchini to make fritters. Optional additions include pecans, walnuts, dried cherries, raisins, or chocolate chips.",

Cut back the salt in the recipe to 1/2 tsp.",

I made muffins out of this recipe--I got 12 muffins out of this that were on the big side. 350 for a little over 20 minutes and they were just right. Mine came out a little dry so next time I'll add a touch more liquid (a quarter cup or so) and see if that dosen't help. I'll also add a little more nutmeg and cinnamon and to make it lighter I'll substitute unsweetened applesauce for half the butter and one of the eggs. The kids and I really liked this recipe.
