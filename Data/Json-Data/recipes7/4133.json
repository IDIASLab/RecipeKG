The recipe granted is very involved for a muffin and requires a lot of ingredients. Maybe this unfortunately makes people pass it by. But here is a perfect example of how the effort you put into something is SO worth the results! As the first reviewer I felt a responsibility to strictly stick to the recipe and other than using full fat sour cream and skipping the optional Parmesan topping I did. As these were baking (mine only took 30 minutes) the aroma was so good it truly was making my mouth water - and I'm not being dramatic to stress a point! Healthy flavorful ingredients and flecked with lovely colors but the true test would be the taste test. You have outdone yourself! They are perfect! Moist great texture beautiful and such a unique flavor! You have this recipe down pat and I would strongly encourage others not only to try these but to make them exactly as the recipe directs - that means no shortcuts no changes no substitutions or deletions. I can't imagine how this recipe could be improved upon the perfection it already is. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",

But if you do have the time these are well worth it. I made 1/2 a batch and now wished I made the whole thing. Mine came out perfectly beautiful after 32 minutes. I'll definitely make these again and might try making them in stages. I think I'd prep the zucchini mixture a day ahead cover and refrigerate it. And the dry ingredients could easily be combined a day ahead. This is a wonderful recipe so do give it a try. Just plan ahead!",

I followed the recipe pretty exact with only a few modifications added a handful of seeds (mix of flax sunflower and pumpkin) added an additional 1T of milk since my mixture seemed a tad on the dry side (maybe from the seed addition) and used herbs de Provence since I didn t have dried basil and parsley. Unlike other reviewers mine were perfectly baked at 38 min. I will definitely make these again and maybe try other vegetable/cheese combinations spinach tomato feta sounds goods.

They lacked zip so with the roasted red peppers etc in the food processor we added one seedless and deveined jalapeno pepper another 1/2-1 tsp salt a handful of parmesan cheese and replaced 1/2 c all purpose flour with 1/2 c nutritional yeast (not brewers or quick rise yeast) (available at most health food stores). Delicious.",
