The liquid to flour ratio is off in this recipe basic cake ratio is 1 part fat 2 parts sugar 3 parts flour and 4 eggs. I wanted 12 cupcakes so I adjusted the recipe to 1/2 cup butter 1 cup sugar 1 1/2 cups flour 2 eggs 1/2 cup Guiness 1/3 cup sour cream 1/3 cup cocoa 1 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsps baking powder (I used Dutch processed cocoa which requires baking powder not soda) For the frosting I used 1/4 cup of Baileys Irish Cream and added an additional 1/4 cup of icing sugar as it was a bit soft for piping would add a little more next time. Baked in 23 minutes and yielded 14 cupcakes. Made for an early St. Patrick's Day lunch strong in flavour but tasty.",
