It was lighter than the other recipe probably because of the cake flour. If you like a lighter cake, make this one. However, the frosting has some flaws. It was much to runny. I ended up having to make the other recipes icing from this, which wasn\u2019t easy. 4/5 on the cake, 2/5 on the frosting.  In my opinion, make the other recipe as is.",
