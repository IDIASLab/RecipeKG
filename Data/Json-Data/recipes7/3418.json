I only had the powdered pectin which I added slowly, stirred frequently and used two boxes.  I think in hind sight I could have used a box and a half.  You need to cook jelly until it passes the \"gel-test.\"  Put a small dish in the freezer until it's cold, drop a puddle of your concoction on the dish and push it back with your finger - if there's a light skin on the top and the mixture slides back, it's done.  Mine turned out a little too thick when I put it in the fridge, but at room temperature the texture is perfect.  Instead of mincing the red peppers I used peeled/roasted red peppers and put them in a food processor.  Worked out perfectly - lovely red flecks of peppers mixed in with the carrot shreds.  Now here's the real orgasm... pour some jelly on top of ch\u00e8vre (goat cheese) and serve it with crackers...  OMG!  That'll snap any silly cowgirl right on out of the blues!  Tomorrow I will try to blend some with butter to make habanero butter...  Thank you so much!",

I am new at making any kind of jam with my concentration being on pepper jams. I did not notice the recipe called for LIQUID pectin so I accidently added the stated amount in powder. My jam has not set up like others I have made. Can someone tell me if it had to do with using powder instead of liquid or is this particular jam more of a honey consistency? I haven't tried any yet because I keep hoping it will set up however it has been about a month and hasn't. Should I just toss and make again using liquid?",

Like others I had concerns about the carrots but they do blend well. There is a strong vinegar scent to the finished jelly that I find off-putting.
