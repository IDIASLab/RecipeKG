These brownies are VERY good with the potential of being excellent. The fudgy texture of mine was perfect after 35 minutes @ 350. My only complaint is that the cayenne and orange flavors as written are far too subtle to the point of being unnoticeable - so you may want to play with that a little. I doubled the cayenne and quadrupled the orange zest and ended up with wonderful dark chocolatey orangey brownies that I will be making as my chocolate dessert at Thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used walnuts instead of hazelnuts - only because I was running short on time and didn't feel like removing the skins from the hazelnuts. I look forward to using them next time though as I think they would have been better. The brownies are both cakelike and fudgy at the same time (which I love!) and although I didn't mind the cayenne and orange background flavors I think I would have preferred one or the other but not both. I think next time I'll omit the orange zest and add a pinch of cinnamon as cayenne and cinnamon give chocolate a more Mexican/Mayan flare to me. Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!",
