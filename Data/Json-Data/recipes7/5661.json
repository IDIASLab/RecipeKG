I'm glad the reviewers so far like the popsicles :)  One little change is that I don't blend the cookies until they're fine crumbs, coarse crumbs are good.  Allrecipes changed the directions a bit when they published it.  I think it's nice to have some little hunks of cookie in the popsicles though so don't worry if your blender doesn't do the best job of completely pulverizing the cookies!",

This recipe was just right for what I had on hand and I was able to use my small food processor for both crushing the cookies and making strawberry puree. I used little dixie cups for these pops and once they'd gotten firm I just stuck popsicles sticks in the little cups. This way you could just peel down the cup \"wrapper\" and go to town. Great change on your usual frozen pop recipe.",

They were pretty good but both my daughter and I thought the cookie cheesecake part was super sweet and clashed somewhat with the strawberry part giving the strawberries a bitter tang. Maybe adding more sugar to the strawberries would help that or possibly swirling the mixture thoroughly before pouring instead of layering. I would have polled the boys on what they thought but they were out the door like a shot with them and I never heard any complaints later! So we'll give this recipe a solid 4 stars:)",

The only change I made in the recipe was to add a dash of kosher salt to the pudding and cookie crumb mixture to balance the sweetness and I did use sugar-free pudding mix and fat-free milk. The pops are sort of reminiscent of the strawberry shortcake pops you can buy at the store but the texture is very different and the strawberry flavor is more intense. This recipe made eight standard pops for me. Thanks so much for sharing!",
