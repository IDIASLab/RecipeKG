In the end, I suspect the filling would have been softer had I peeled them; however, I did not care for its extra effort. The next time I make this, I will add 3/4 t. ground nutmeg when adding the cinnamon for flavor. \n\nDo yourself a favor and make the buttercrust pie dough used in Chef John's video for a mouth-watering, super-flaky crust. For that recipe, go to foodwishes.com and type 'buttercrust pastry dough' in the search box. Click on the first link. Voila!",

I used one box of the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts, which made about 11 pies, using a 3 inch star shaped cookie cutter. I was able to cut out 8 stars on each sheet, then balled up the dough and rolled it out again. The filling is absolutely delicious! The little hand pies turned out great and were super easy to make. My kids loved them and I like how using the cookie cutters makes a nice dessert portion size. Definitely would make again!",

The only fruit I had in the house was one nectarine, but I remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you don't have enough apples, so I used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling. The only other thing I changed was to substitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon. My gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown, but so delicious!
