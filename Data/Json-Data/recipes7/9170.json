The only difference from the original was that I used up the fresh pineapple I had in the fridge and added extra water to make up for some liquid. I added the (optional coconut) as I like the flavour. I had a little extra batter than what the original recipe amount calls for because I made 24 instead of 27 since it was an odd number with the two-12 cup muffin pans that I have. Even at that my muffins were done in 20-22 minutes. I can't see it taking 30 minutes to bake, I guess it may depend on where you live and your oven. Well, anyways they were so moist and light I couldn't believe it, and this without any oil or butter! I kept the amount of sugar as I like to stick to the original recipe as much as possible to rate it first, and I'm glad I did as the sugar makes the tops of the muffins like candy, sticky a bit. I really like that combination of soft moist middle and bottoms and a somewhat sticky crunchy top. We have only 2 muffins left, that should tell you something about this recipe :) Thanks for the post Katrina!",

I made larger muffins (got a dozen) and the only criticism that I have is the muffins were slightly overcooked. I checked at 25 minutes (not even 30) but will check at 20 minutes in the future. This must be a very old recipe because I haven't seen crushed pineapple in a 14-oz can for MANY years (always 8 or 20 oz these days). Chopped pecans would be a nice addition. This made a very nice breakfast muffin and I definitely will make again.",
