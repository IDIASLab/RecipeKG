The filling firms up enough after cooling a bit that you can cut it into squares to serve.  The filling is creamy, and the top of the cobbler is a soft and buttery crumble, just delicious.  The recipe doesn't say whether to cool or how to serve.  I served it warm with a little whipped cream sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice.  Thanks, Holly, thumbs up on this one, it's a keeper, and I wouldn't change a thing!",
