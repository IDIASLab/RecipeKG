I was only feeding 3 so I halved the amount of squash and noodles but ended up keeping the rest the same. I liked the result of having a higher ratio of eggs to noodles/squash but that would be a personal choice. I think this dish could become very good with some tweaking though so next time I will double the amount of onion that I caramelized (I used one medium sweet onion) add salt TO the dish (heh) and add more seasonings. I'm also going to stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup chicken broth because it ended up rather dry.",
