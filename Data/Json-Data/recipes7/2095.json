I might try this again but cook the berries with 1 c water and 1 c sugar first then freeze and add the rest in and see how it turns out.

My marshmallows were old and hard large ones so it took a while. Then I drizzled some whipping cream (more like half a cup since that was all I had) into the food processor at the end. My 4 year old who normally would turn his nose up at something like this said he loves it and called it cranberry whip ice cream. He even asked to take it in his school lunch tomorrow! I will definitely try this recipe again but next time will try leaving out the sugar it was awfully sweet. Oh despite what another reviewer said I would never use whipped topping instead of whipping cream. Whipped topping is incredible unhealthy and full of GMOs.",
