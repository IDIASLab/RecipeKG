Similar to the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe on this site, but a LOT less sugar. I did make two adjustments to this recipe. I cut the cloves down to 1/2 tsp, as I thought 1 tsp would have been too much, as cloves can be pretty powerful. I also needed to add a bit more flour, as the batter was way too loose. I made two loaves (7\" x 3\" pans) and baked for exactly 47 minutes. A nice, moist, and flavorful pumpkin bread. Thanks for the recipe!",
