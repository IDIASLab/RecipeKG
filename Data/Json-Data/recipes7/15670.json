I really wanted to like this because all the ingrediants sounded great but this hummus just didn't come together for us. Firstly a \"bouguet garni\" is a bundle of herbs wrapped with leeks or cheesecloth and tied with string so no idea how you would put that in a food processor. Secondly a 1/2 cup of vinegar? Maybe it's a typo but I certainly wouldn't suggest that much. The arugula gave the dip a beautiful color but combined with the artichokes it took over and was rather bitter.",
