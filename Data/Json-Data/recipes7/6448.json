I've honestly made it at least a million times! ;) Like other reviewers I've also used sausage (usually smoked sausage) instead of ham. Either way it's amazingly yummy. I sometimes add a large handful of those precut julienned carrots, just for color, and I think one could add lots of different vegetables as well. The basic recipe really lends itself to a sort of clean-out-the-fridge meal. The only other thing I do differently is that I add the meat at the beginning, with the veggies, and then let everything slowly saut\u00e9 into the yummy goodness that is this simple and homely dinner. Oh, and I have never remembered to add the sugar and water at the end.",
