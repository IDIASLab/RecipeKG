This one sounded easy & I really like the idea of the browned butter. That was last night thank God I had more bananas because we finished the loaf and I am now waiting for another to finish baking! The browning of the butter is essential...it smells so heavenly and tastes delicious... do NOT skip this step! The only thing I did differently is that I buttered my loaf pan and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the bottom and sides makes it a little sweeter and gave it a little \"crunch\" on the ends. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.... I can hardly wait til the bananas over ripen again!",

For the people who are having discrepancies with the cooking times and perhaps ending up with a dry loaf, please remember there are a variety of different materials used to make bread pans.  Anything from light silver colour to dark teflon to glass and now silicon.  Lighter coloured pans do not absorb the heat like a dark coloured pan.  So if you are using a dark colour, you may want to turn the heat down slightly and/or reduce the cooking time.  Teflon and silicon add a different texture to foods cooked in those pans again. (sides are often tough or rubbery).   My suggestion is to find as many light coloured cooking pans, cookie sheets and muffin tins as you can!  You will always end up with a more uniform product that doesn't cook on the outside faster than it does on the inside.  :)",
