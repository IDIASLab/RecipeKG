And fun to make too! I made the job of filling the cupcake cups easier on myself by pouring the batter into a gallon ZipLoc bag and piping it in. Worked great! Also I found I could use a little more than the 1/2 T. of filling if that helps. I baked them for the minimum recommended baking time and they were perfectly moist. I did use the mini Oreos after finally finding them in the fourth store I looked for them Costco. All I could find until then were the Oreo Cakesters! I'm glad I found them as they do look nice to top the cupcakes but regular sized Oreos would do just fine in a pinch. I didn't use the Cool Whip as these will be served where refrigeration is not possible. I LOVED what I ended up frosting them with - White Cake Frosting II also from this site. Absolutely decadent memorable and certainly worthy of making again!\"",

I did find that I used a bit more of than 1/2 Tbsp. of cream cheese mixture per cupcake but that's OK because the more the better. I didn't use Cool Whip for the frosting but opted for \"White Cake Frosting II\" from this site that I've used on \"Cookies 'n Cream Cake\" before. It tastes just like the inside of an Oreo and it pipes beautifully. It worked great on these little beauties!",
