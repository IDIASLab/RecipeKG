They are light and delicate with the cinnamon adding a nice touch reminding you of Thanksgiving and Holiday time. I've been making these for months (when they were still unpublished) and the outcome is always consistent. The walnuts add a nice texture. The sugar/flour ratio is right on never too sweet. I recently made a batch omitting the butter adding 1 cup of sugarless \"Chunky Pumpkin Apple Butter from sueb\" on the AR site. The pumpkin and cinnamon really sparkle and the result is a bit more dense but still very good. They taste like light pumpkin bread with walnuts. Thank you Bobby Susan for the versatile recipe.",

Finally when they did cook I took them out to cool and they started to sink down and became very dense! These cupcakes did taste very good though. It was not to sweet and it had a good balance the amount of carrots were not over powering either. Over all these cupcake were really not something i would make again.",
