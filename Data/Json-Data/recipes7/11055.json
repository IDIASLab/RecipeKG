(When to add the wine?)\" Other than using some dried celery flakes instead of celery (would've preferred the real thing, but didn't have any), I was faithful to this recipe. Red wine was listed on the ingredient list, but never mentioned in the directions, so I ended up stirring it in at step 3. Let it simmer for the recommended 3 hrs, and yes, it required frequent stirrings during that time. Served over 1/2 spaghetti noodles, half \"zoodles\" (zucchini cut into noodle-ey strips and saut\u00e9ed in a little olive oil). Good sauce, and once my tomato garden explodes later this summer, I may swap the canned out for fresh and make triple batches of this to freeze.",
