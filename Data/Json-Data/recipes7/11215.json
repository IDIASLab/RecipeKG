                "reviewBody": "I love muffins and I had some frozen blueberries and cranberries to use up so I decided to try this today. They are tasty and we will eat them all but we thought they were just OK. They had an unusual gummy texture which I think was from using so much water and the cooked oats. Perhaps it was from using 2 eggs; most muffin recipes I make only use 1. Or maybe I didn't get enough water out of my frozen blueberries. We thought they needed something to give them some oomph so I made a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar which really went well with it. Be aware that the recipe directions do not mention the eggs; I put them in after I put the smoothie mixture in the bowl. Also I can understand why the recipe submitter may have called for making more smoothie than needed. I made a double batch so I doubled all the ingedients except what went in the smoothie. I got just 2 cups of mixture--just what was needed for the double batch. I think the issue is cranberries and blueberries are round and different sizes; how they fit in your measuring cup will vary. I think Cheerios wanted to ensure that exactly 1 c of the mixture was used becauce you could end up getting more or less than someone else. If I'd had any remaining I would have just made a smoothie. Thank you for the interesting recipe.",

Unfortunately it was still there. I think the combo of fruit providing all the moisture and the cooked oatmeal meant that it was inevitable. I like the idea of using the fruit smoothie mixture to add flavor to a muffin because my husband doesn't like if there are pieces of fruit but it didn't work out like I hoped in this.",
