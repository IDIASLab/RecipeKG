I kept looking at them to see if they were done using the direction of the submitter about baking them until they are not moist. It was hard to tell because of the color of the coating and I did overcook them in the 25 minutes they were in the oven. These were pretty good but I thought maybe there was too much sugar for the amount of pecans that I had weighed for accuracy.",
