        "description": "Tonja was born in the 1940's and this is her cousin Toni's boyfriend's grandmother's eggnog, so I'm guessing this is from  the mid-1800's and probably dates much earlier. The original recipe called for half milk and half cream, but I use half and half.  Delicious and simple, but be warned, Granny apparently liked a kick!  I've made it from scratch and with the modern equivalents and it's fantastic either way.  Do yourself a favor and use a mixer for everything.  Those who like eggnog LOVE this recipe.  I never leave a party with leftovers.",

Our family has had this every year that I remember.. raw eggs were never an issue(I think it s the alcohol in it). If there is a worry- wash the shells gently before you open the egg. BTW - we add cinnamon and use Amaretto (instead of bourbon or rum). This is a GREAT recipe - make sure to mix well before serving!",

We made this recipe at least five times throughout the Holidays last year. And we have never purchased store-bought eggnog again. Here is the Modification that we use: We use 8 eggs 1 cup of Splenda and 1/2 cup of sugar or just 1-1/2 cup of sugar 1 quart of 2 % milk 1 pint of whipping cream into a large mixing bowl combining all of the ingredients. Pour the Half and Half into the 6-8 quart stock pot and bring to a slow simmer. Meanwhile take 1 cup of hot Half and Half out of the stock pot and while using the mixer on the high setting gradually combine the hot Half and Half into the mixing bowl with the egg mixture. This process will temper the eggs before you add them back into the stock pot. After combining all of the mixing bowl contents into the stock pot stir constantly on low for 40 to 45 minutes or until the mixture reaches 168-170 degrees on a candy thermometer. While the mixture cooks it will become thicker and will continue to temper and heat the eggs to safety. Add 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla extract and nutmeg. Pour the mixture into a heat resistant pitcher and Chill overnight. Once chilled stir in the Rum or a favorite liqueur. A very delicious treat for anytime of the year. Enjoy!",
