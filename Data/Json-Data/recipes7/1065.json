I saw the star rating and read the reviews for this salad and immediately my pessimistic side thought no salad made with a combo of these odd ingredients could ever be that good. So I made the salad, partly in a effort to counter those who have continued to hail it's excellence.  \nMy first complaint was the estimated prep time of 20 minutes.  It took me quite a bit longer than that, but I can be easily distracted and perhaps I use a slower cutting/chopping technique. \nBut in the end, I was forced to accept defeat, for everyone at the cookout did, in fact, rave about this salad and inquire as to who made it.  Yes, it really is that good.",

I almost gave it 5 stars, but didn't since I had to make so many changes to the original...and I think the changes really made it much better. The changes I made are as follows: (1) lightly steam the broccoli, (2) omit the dried cranberries...preference only, (3) omit the green grapes and double the red grapes, (4) slice the red grapes in half, (5) reduce the sugar to 2 Tablespoons, (6) reduce the wine vinegar to 2-3 Tablespoons, (7) reduce the mayo to 1/2 cup, and (8) add 1/2 cup of regular sour cream. Everyone really likes this salad...even my 4 year old gobbled it up! Thanks.",

I, too, quickly steamed the broccoli and the peas but kept them still basically raw. The steam also helps to bring their color out. I used reg grapes only since that is what I had. I thought the recipe could have used more almonds so I just kept adding till it seemed more consistent throughout. The almonds I found in the store were roasted slivered almonds. They were very tasty and added a nice dimension to the rawness of the rest. I cut way back on the amount of dressing the recipe called for. It would have been drowning in mayo if I hadn't reduced it back by at least half. I think just getting it coated lightly was enough. \n\nOne note: I decided to make the bacon but didn't put it on the salad but instead in a bowl on the side. That way vegetarians could still eat it - where if anyone wanted the meat they could sprinkle it on. It went over well at the party. I will make it again.",

I used 2 cups of red grapes instead of red and green and I ran out of sugar so I used splenda instead and I couldn't even tell the difference. Make this recipe and everyone will be sure to love it!
