I did a LOT of research first. here's my notes: a. did not use calvados as cheapest bottle i could find was 40. thought about subbing apple juice but decided to not use anything at all. b. used mixture of apples. granny smiths not recommended (surprisingly) as they did not hold up well to being fried. fujis better oddly enough. very tasty. c. meat thermometer a must. took 4 hours to cook at 400 deg. used a single layer of foil to wrap bird not fully just like a taco shell lengthwise. edges exposed a little tried to cover it up with a second smaller patch sheet. came out fine. important: uncover for last 20-30 minutes of cooking to brown skin. important: leave bird in oven for 20 min after hitting 180deg at thigh center with door open so juices recirculate and gets really tasty. d. meat came out TENDER and very nice. all gone in 20 minutes and used 11.6lb bird (suggested is 8-12 no more because bird will be too old and tough. e. HIGHLY suggested to use a pan with rack. i didnt have one so i had to gingerly move the bird out with bamboo spoons to a wok then pour the 400deg oil out into glass jars then move bird back in... if i had a rack i could have just lifted the bird out. don't burn yourself! f. enjoy the goose. it was an amazing hit. 60 frozen at store UNEVISERCATED is best.",

This was my first try at goose my hubbie has wanted it for a couple of years for Christmas but it has always been so expensive; I found a frozen goose in January after the holidays on sale that was MUCH cheaper so I thought I would give it a try. I pretty much followed this recipe exactly and it turned out nicely. My nine pound bird took almost three hours to cook to 185 degrees. The apples were worth the time it took to fry them as they were a good accompaniment to the bird itself and had most of the spice flavor. Since the skin is spiced the flavor is mostly in the skin and juices but the bird itself had a good flavor that really didn't need too much else. It is akin to a cross between duck and a red meat very dark. It is also a very fatty bird that generates a lot of oil. I made a gravy out of some drippings the organs and chicken broth and it paired nicely. Served with some au gratin potatoes for a very tasty meal. This was a nice way to serve goose in the winter the sweet spices made it aromatic and interesting. Would recommend this recipe.",

I also sauteed a half a small onion with the fruit.  I did not have the apple brandy, so I used Grand Marnier (orange liqueur).  My goose was 9 lbs. and it took about 3 hours to cook completely.",
