(I don't tend to use shortening and I think the shortening that 'grandma' would have used is much different that the shortening sold today.) Because I used butter I didn't add the butter flavored extract.  I also use butter to grease the pan, it makes for a lovely crust. The method as written needs a little help. I don't suggest just adding all the flour, eggs and buttermilk all at once.  I creamed the butter & sugar until light and fluffy, added the flavoring.  Then added the eggs one at a time, incorporating each egg before adding the next one. Then alternated adding the sifted flour and buttermilk on low speed until combined. The cake had a nice crunchy crust and a tender interior.  Excellent for topping with berries or for a trifle.   Note to self.  When making this recipe, use an angel food cake pan, my bundt cake pan is a little to small and the cake rose over the edge and almost overflowed, which made it difficult to get out of the pan.  Thanks for sharing Grandma Ruby's recipe with us, it is a keeper!",
