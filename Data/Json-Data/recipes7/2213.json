                "reviewBody": " LET ME STATE TWO THINGS FROM THE GET GO: I didn't think about measuring out the yeast, I just automatically added the whole packet and I do not own a bread machine. I made this bread with my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end. I warmed the honey with the water to very warm, not hot. (Boiling water will kill your yeast.) I dissolved the coffee in the warm honey water, then added it to the yeast in the mixer bowl and let it proof for ten minutes. After that, I added the melted butter, then the rest of the ingredients. I needed about a 1/4 c. of extra whole wheat flour to get the dough together enough to pull together and jump on the hook. I greased up the dough just a bit with a little of the butter from the bowl I melted the butter in, then set it to knead with the hook for five minutes. I let it rise in a greased metal bowl on my warm oven for an hour, then shaped it into a loaf and set it to rise in the loaf pan for another hour and a half, or until it almost rose above the loaf pan. I baked it at 350* for about 25 minutes, or until it smelled done. This is a nice whole wheat loaf with a distinctive flavor that is really like nothing I've ever had before. Just outstanding. Fluffy and rich tasting, almost like a bakery bread. This would be great with a nice hearty stew. I'd make this again. NOTE: Make sure your loaf pan is well greased. I had a difficult time getting this particular bread out of my pan. ",

We love homemade bread & this is a new favorite! I only use the dough cycle though.  I doubled this recipe for my 2-lb machine and used the dough cycle. When it was complete I took it out and formed it into balls. I got 24 balls from this doubled recipe. These make great sandwich buns or dinner rolls. This bread rose VERY nicely and wasn't sticky AT ALL. You MUST use bread flour and NOT all purpose white flour. If you choose to use the dough cycle and then bake it on your own as I do - just form the balls and put out on 2 sprayed cookie sheets, cover with plastic wrap and let rise another 30 mins or until doubled in size and then remove wrap carefully & bake at 325 for 15 - 20 mins. (Depends on your oven.) If you use typical loaf pans then extend baking time to about 20 - 30 mins. You could also try mini loaf pans! DELISH!!",
