I settled on this recipe based on ratings, and I wasn't disappointed.  After reading reviews, the only thing I did differently was to use lime juice instead of the vinegar, though I think I'll try it with the vinegar next time just to see.  Anyway, I think these need to be cooked slightly longer than the 6 minutes as directed, even if you like them a bit crunchy.  As for the taste of the squash, it's kind of like a cross between a potato, squash, and eggplant if you can imagine that.  A very light, crisp flavor.  The seasoning was just the right mix of heat and sweet - though next time I may kick both up a bit.  Overall, I'm happy to have found a new side dish and will be trying this again.",
