The flavor is just awesome! The only thing I would have liked to taste more of is the sesame oil. It is there but I would have just liked more of it. I'm a huge fan of that taste though so I think as written would be best for most people. I did use beef ribs but am now anxious to try this recipe with pork ribs. Thanks for sharing!",
