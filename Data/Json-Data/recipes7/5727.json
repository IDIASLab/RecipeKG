Just keep an eye on it at all times. Other than that it's very good.",

The mini marshmallows brown less quickly and more evenly and they are also easier to cut as they are more in proportion with the size of the bar. I set my broiler on low heat and it took about 5-6 minutes until they were lightly browned. I set mine in the freezer until cold and stored it in the refrigerator between servings. The ganache filling is gooey so refrigeration or freezing helps for it to set before eating.",

They ate the 13X9 tray in an hour. Not kidding! I used different sizes of marshmallows because I thought that would make it visually interesting. DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF IT when it is under the broiler. 1 minute is too long to brown marshmallows. Re-reading recipe today I realized I forgot the cinnamon. Did not matter to the boys. Good fun recipe! Thanks and I took two pix to document it!",
