If I made this again I would also use less sugar the juice of the lime and at least twice the mint. You can barely taste it at all. Modifications: 1. Used an 8\" x 4\" baking dish (couldn't find 7x3) 2. Mix of olive and vegetable oil (couldn't find grapeseed oil) 3. Added the juice from the zested lime (batter tasted a little bland) 4. Baked it for 75 minutes (!!!) Given that the baking dish I used was larger I exepected a shorter cooking time not more than double.",

                "reviewBody": "This is an interesting bread and I went with it bc I wanted something different and had blackberries to use. Yes I know it calls for blueberries but none of my blackberry recipes did it for me. I am puzzled by the comment that states that in a larger pan it should cook more quickly--smaller pans cook faster because there is less surface area to heat hence the reason cupcakes cook faster than a cake. Regardless I suppose it's counterintuitive so it doesn't really matter why. I baked this in a single loaf pan and wouldn't recommend that--it's too much batter. I did notice that but went ahead anyway bc I was too lazy to redistribute. So it took over an hour and a half to bake and it overflowed but whatever. I used lemon extract and zest and used rum instead of rum extract (I really thought I had that but I don't!) and am glad for the turbinado sugar which makes for a nice topping. For those not in the know (this includes myself I had to google it) sucanat is a type of sugar processed to retain molassess. Not exactly brown sugar but that's what I subbed. I doubled the mint and can definitely taste it. This is a unique and fun recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
