My husband even liked it and he is pretty old fashioned (meat and potatos kind of man). He said it tasted exotic.

I also added about 1/2 package of sliced fresh strawberries that were sweet enough so that the \"white sugar to taste\" was not even needed. If you do add strawberries it will turn the melon slightly red on the edges so you might want to add them when about to serve. I will most definitely make it again!",
