Oh yes, back to the crust......we really enjoyed this crust.  I didn't know what 'hard white whole wheat flour' was, so I used 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup brown whole wheat flour.  I proofed the yeast and sugar before adding all ingredients to the bread machine.  I let the dough rise in a bowl 30 minutes after taking it out of the bread machine.  This dough was extremely easy to work with and I definitely would use this recipe again.  I'm going to try another store or 2 to try and find the correct flour. I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Pizza and crust were delicious!  Thanks Miriam for sharing your recipes, I look forward to trying your other published ones.",

There was way too much dough for my liking (I like a really thin crust) so I split it between two pizza stones and invited the neighbors over to eat the second pizza. Next time I will likely just split the recipe in half. After rolling out the dough to about 1/8-1/4 inch thick I melted some butter and cut up fresh rosemary and brushed it over the top of the pizza dough. I put some shredded bbq chicken (wish I could say it was homemade but it was actually the Jack Daniels bbq chicken from Costco) onion and fresh mozzarella cheese over the dough and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 11-13 minutes. My husband isn't usually a fan of things with whole wheat but he loved it and this recipe made it to his \"make this dinner again\" list.",

According to Bob's Red Mill it is flour ground from whole grain hard white wheat berries. And now we know! No clue if I can get it at my local grocery store but I'll check the next time I'm in that aisle. Since I don't have the flour I used half whole wheat flour and half white for this and it turned out well. I baked at 425 for about 25-30 minutes with toppings and hubs and I enjoyed it for dinner. thanks for the recipe!",
