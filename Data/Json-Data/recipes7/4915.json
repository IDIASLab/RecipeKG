They did not disappoint. Full of flavor with a wonderful moist cakey texture. The blueberries and mango held up perfectly within the batter and the combination of the two is a match made in heaven. But it doesn't stop there. The coconut streusel is the 'icing on the cake' that takes these muffins over the top. I followed this recipe just as written with no adjustments at all save for making them a batch of 12 rather than 16 (I like to overfill muffin cups). Served them for breakfast this morning and the kids wondered what they had done to deserve such a treat:D Thanks for a brilliant recipe geranium.",

And here's what I changed: doubled the streusel added a tad bit brown sugar to streusel used applesauce instead of butter in muffin batter used half whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed to make them healthier and had to use regular milk because I didn't have buttermilk.

After slicing it open cut a crosshatch pattern but don't slice through the skin. Then slide blade along the skin and you get mango chunks. Much easier than peeling a mango. Someone told me how so I thought I would share. I use a whole mango and it is the perfect amount.",

These are good and we thought the blueberry overpowered the mango to the point that all you really taste is the blueberry. If I were to make these again I would cut the blueberry to 1/2 cup and up the mango by 1/2 cup in return. These are also pretty sweet for our taste so I think I would cut the sugar by 1/4 cup as well. I also think I would have been better served to put this into 20 muffin cups - my 16 overflowed and I ended up with some sticking issues as a result. We loved the coconut struesel and next time think we would sub brown sugar for the white. Thanks for sharing!",

Update 1/30/11: I have made these over a dozen times now and they never fail to impress. Still don't change a thing they are amazing just the way geranium intended them to be. I've used both fresh and frozen blueberries very ripe and slightly ripe mangos and they are good either way. I use this recipe for \"thank you gifts\" or whenever I want to make an impressive treat.

If you're a fan of coconut then I would leave the flakes as be and even double the streusel mixture. It was very good! I'm going to bake these in a large muffin pan next batch because the standard size was just too small to enjoy these creations! I made these two days ago and today they tasted the best.
