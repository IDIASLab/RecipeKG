I didn't even use all of the mayo part of the dressing because the slaw already was so watery in the bowl. If I make this one again I'll do one of two things: (1) cut the vinegar portion of the dressing in half keeping the mayo the same or (2) eliminate the vinegar dressing all together and just mix in the mayo portion. I'd probably go with the latter option because I think this recipe simply may have too many ingredients. I'm the first reviewer and I don't want to discourage others from trying this recipe but I just don't care for slaw with this dressing consistency. You'd have to put this slaw in a small bowl otherwise it's going to run all over your plate.",
