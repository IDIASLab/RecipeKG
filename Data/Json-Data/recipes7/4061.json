I hate when people alter a recipe and then review it BUT (yes, you guessed it) I changed it a bit:  I didn't have soy sauce so I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp rice vinegar and I didn't add the lime juice because I don't like it.  That's it!  I think the servings are a bit off because I needed a bit for one serving of pasta, but other than that this is a great recipe!",

You can use this as a sauce for a Thai style pasta, but you probably want to add about 1/2 cup chicken/vegetable broth to it when it's in the food processor so it will distribute better through your pasta. I like to saute cubed tofu (1 inch size), shredded cabbage and bean sprouts, add a package of cooked rice noodles, and then toss with this sauce. Delicious, filling, healthy and easy!",
