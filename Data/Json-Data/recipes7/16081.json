I used the brown sugar instead of white but this was only alteration. Very buttery tasting and would be excellent paired with vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet and great flavor. Mine only took about 20min cooking due to convection and smaller dish so cannot comment on cook time for the recipe size given.",

And I used half white sugar and half brown sugar though I'm sure it would taste great with either type. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon into the oat/flour mixture. A pastry blender would make incorporating the butter much faster and easier. Since I don't have one I used two butter knives to 'cut in' the butter...I trick my mother-in-law taught me years ago! I will definitely make this recipe again and may even try it with blueberries.",
