I was concerned while making it, because my mixture didn't seem to be thickening up; I have an electric stove and had the burner set to medium. It took me about ten minutes to get the mixture to thicken, but once it did, there was no question that it was ready.  I followed all of the measurements exactly. The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for it to form up before eating! :D",
