These were delicious!  I only made 1/2 to the batter to try it because Chef John said he got 20 when he made them, and still got 11 nice sized muffins.  They came out of the oven about an hour and a 1/2 ago and already 5 are gone!  My picky eater approved!  So 2nd batch later on this week! Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!! :)",
