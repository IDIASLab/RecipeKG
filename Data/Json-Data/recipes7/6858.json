So here goes. 1) Use Greek yogurt. Much better for you, and makes the cookies moist and rich. 2) Use wheat flour. No reason to use white flour (which is as bad - or worse - for you as sugar is). With oatmeal cookies, you won't be able to tell a difference. Well, only slightly. ;) 3) Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Which brings up another point: use unsalted butter. :) 4)Toast your nuts before-hand. I toast mine in a 350 degree oven for 5-10 minutes. That will bring out all of the nut's crunchiness and nuttiness and flavor. I used pecans. You can use any kind of nut you want! 5) Roughly chop the pecans and cranberries before adding them to the batter.  I love the addition of the carrots! That is pure ingeniousness. 6) My cookies needed much longer to cook. 7) A neat addition to these cookies is peanut butter. That's up to you.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, \"MakeItHealthy\"!",

The cookies did not spread out in the oven so after the first batch I pressed them down before baking. I just tasted one from the first pan and I think they are a little bland even considering all the flavors that are in them. I think the recipe would benefit from a little salt (I did use unsalted butter as I do for all baking). DH who I really made them for didn't like them either and has taken them to work (those folks will eat anything!). Sorry but I won't be making these again.",
