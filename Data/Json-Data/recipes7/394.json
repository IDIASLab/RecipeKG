I wanted more of that \"caramel\" taste and this just tasted like sweetened condensed milk w/ pecans and coconut (a yummy flavor, but just not what I expect in a German Chocolate Cake). \r\n\r\nI made the mistake of inverting the cake before frosting it.  The recipe does not make enough frosting to cover the sides of the cake.  So, if you make this - just leave it in the pan and frost the top only! :)\r\n\r\nDEFINETELY cook it for much longer than 6 minutes to thicken up the frosting.  I probably cooked it closer to 15 minutes (maybe even longer).",

I do agree with several reviews on here, that the recipe does not have much of a carmel flavor, but you can remedy that by adding 3 TBS of Brown Sugar.  I also recommend you cook it for 10 mins not 6 so that it gets thick enough.  P.S. Almonds are a great substitute for pecans, and much better for you!!!!",
