I think I would cut back on the onion just a little if you don't like having that onion taste in your mouth an hour later. I did not have time to put my dressing in the refrigerator for an hour so I blended it with my hand held blender. This gave it a smooth frothy look and might explain why mine tasted so oniony. Anyway great recipe!",

I used brown sugar instead of white and it worked well with the apple cider vinegar. I didn't have an onion so I had to omit it but it was still good. I used a combination of mostly olive oil some vegetable oil and a dash of roasted garlic oil. This is a very versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing.",
