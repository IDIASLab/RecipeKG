I substituted butter for the shortening since I felt it would give it more flavor. The bread turned out moist with lots of wonderful flavors the crumb topping adds a nice texture and as well as an additional sweetness. If doubling the recipe as I did there is no need to increase the amount of the crumb mixture there is plenty for two regular size loaves. I had searched a long time for a banana bread recipe with a topping such as this and I will be making this recipe many times again. The reduction in temperatures helps to prevent burning of the crumb topping so I wouldn't skip this step. It helps to create a more moist bread as well. This is a welcome addition to my recipe collection. Thank you so much for sharing.",

When doubling the bread recipe I used 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of almond I also used 4 bananas. The smell was wonderful and it tasted great just too much of the topping for my taste (when doubled). Also cooking time was over an hour with two loafs approx 45 minutes at 350 and 35 minutes at 325. I think I will try apples with this recipe crumb topping is similar to a pie topping that I have for an apple pie. Thanks so much for this recipe.",

I was so frustrated that I made it again and this time split the batter into two loaf pans instead of one there was plenty of crumb topping for the two loaves. I baked it for about 15 min longer checking it every 5 min just in case and it turned out GREAT! and I have 2 banana bread loaves instead of one. I will use this recipe again the crumb topping was wonderful!",
