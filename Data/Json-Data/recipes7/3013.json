I opted for olive oil vs. butter and used a bit of kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper to season. I love the basil on these. Definitely serve hot off the stove as these cool down quickly. You could add a little shaved Parmesan or feta cheese to this to take it over the top - great with grilled steak!",
