I didn't even notice. This was delicious. The cauliflower absorbed the perfect amount of the dressing taking that bitter bite out of it. Everything just worked together perfectly. It gets better as it sits overnight in the refrigerator. If you are needing to bring a side dish to a summer picnic then this is the one you want to take. This is 5 stars all the way and one of the best recipes I've tried all year.",
