Frosted it with the buttercream frosting from this site and sprinkled more coconut on top. It looked magnificent, very impressive. No one would ever guess how easy it was to make. I'll definitely be making this again.",

I added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to the batter as well as the vanilla & almond extract called for in recipe.
