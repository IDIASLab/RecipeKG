I adapted this recipe from several different ones I was able to find on the web. Now I have to control what my non-GF kids eat so that dad will have some for the next day! These are not light and flaky, but the taste is definitely there! Welcome back peanut butter and crackers, cheese and crackers, plain crackers for nomming on! Also, I would expect you could add seasonings like garlic or sprinkle with Parmesan instead of salt, and kick it up a notch.",

They are very good, and even though it is written that they aren't light and fluffy, don't think they are going to be heavy. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for the recipe.",
