I left out the applesauce because i didn't have any on hand and used about 3 med sized bananas. Also used Rum extract since i didn't have any coconut. Bread had good flavor and is not a very sweet bread at all. Would be really good for breakfast with a cup of coffee. I also agree on doubling the topping because there could of been more to cover the loaf. Also i used powdered sugar instead of white sugar for the topping.",
