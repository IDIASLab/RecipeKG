I used three medium butternut squashes and boiled them for 30 minutes with skin. Once done I peeled and placed in my food processor - which I highly recommend doing.  The squash and potatoes mixed beautifully together(no strings or seeds) I added the rest of the ingredients and poured into my pie crust.  I used the marshmallows and my kids ate it up. Again.  I suggest using a food processor/blender to mix the squash and potato - makes the process so much easier and the pie ends up looking better too. If you like pecans you can add them to the batter and/or top of the pie with the marshmallows - it's yummy too!",
