The texture is not what I\u2019m used to for a pound cake, it has more of what I consider a quick bread consistency.  The cake is light, but I didn\u2019t get much rise, so I\u2019ll bump up the baking powder the next time.  It certainly is quick-and-easy with ingredients I always have on hand.  It\u2019s a nice cake, just not what I think of as pound cake.  This would be very good with fresh strawberries or raspberries over the top.  Cookin Mama, thanks for sharing your grandmother\u2019s recipe, we enjoyed it.",

Believe it or not I did not have all purpose flour so I used cake flour. I don\u2019t use whole milk so I used my almond milk. I added just a little bit more of baking powder. I increased the amount of lemon by a half teaspoon of lemon juice. I increased the temperature to 350 and put the batter in a Bundt pan. Also, note that the batter is thin. I set the timer for 30 minutes but the cake  was nowhere done. So I increased it by 30 minutes and the cake was just beautiful the top of it and the sides were crunchy, the good crunchy like  you get on angel food cake. The cake was dense but was really moist. Overall I would definitely use this recipe again over and over. I hate that I had to change it up a little bit but it really did come out good. Thank you so much for this recipe.",
