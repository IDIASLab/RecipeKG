        "description": "The tartness of the grapefruit is softened with the help of brown sugar and vanilla ice cream with a smooth and fluffy meringue on top. This dessert screams sophistication, yet it doesn't require expensive ingredients or fancy baking skills. This 'pie' can be served as the final touch on nice dinners or just for your family when you're craving something other than a scoop of vanilla ice cream after dinner. Also, this dish is great because you can be creative and substitute other citrus fruits instead of the grapefruit, like oranges -- or even pineapple, whatever you'd like!",
