In fairness I did put everything together the night before and kept in the refrigerator so perhaps this additional time allowed the flavors to permeate more than they would have. This has a very interesting flavor and I may well make this again but I think I will cut back a little on the spices especially the cloves and cinnamon. Overall very good though!",

When you mix the spices with the remaining cider at the end it is not mixed as well as it would have been if it was done in the begining...ALSO - you can never have too much brown sugar....It was an Amazing Easter Ham - and so easy becasue I prepared it the night before and then that morning all I have to do was turn it on...I used a pre-cooked bone in ham adn it cooked on low for about 7-8 hours",
