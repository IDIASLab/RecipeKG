In the footnotes the recipe creator mentions reducing the spiciness by eliminating the cayenne pepper, the chile, and then some of the Sriracha if necessary. We both like heat but cayenne is not our favorite way of achieving it so here is what I did. I eliminated both the cayenne pepper and chile but then upped the Sriracha from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup and this was perfect for us. One thing the recipe did not mention and that is that you need to slice your beef against the grain . That is very important with this cut of meat in keeping it tender. This is a great recipe and one I will make often!",

I did it on the stove instead of the grill. I didn't have sesame seeds or whole dried cayenne peppers so just skipped them. Even the picky eater ate three portions. The best part is that it is super easy to throw together - you just have to remember to marinate in advance. I made up the rice and made a bed of rice and put this over it. Really lovely - thanks for sharing.",

I used Gochujang instead of siracha and added more of basically every spice, as well as a couple shakes of tabasco. I marinated my beef for 16 hours and pan seared it because I don't have a barbeque, then put it over rice. it was delicious! thanks for a great recipe :)",
