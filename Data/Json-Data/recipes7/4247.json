Quince needs to be cooked before you use it, so this recipe takes a little longer to prepare than other fruit pies. This recipe also works well using half apples, half quince: just add sliced raw apples to the cooked quince before baking. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.",

I seemed 1/2 cup honey and 3/4 cup in the sauce would be very sweet so I used only 1/4 cup brown sugar in the sauce and it was enough. When I added the sugar mixture to the reserved quince liquid the sauce became too thick so I needed to add more water.
