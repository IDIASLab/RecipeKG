Perhaps we are not fans of fish sauce (never had it before now), which I felt smelled odd and probably contributed to our dislike of the marinade.  If you enjoy fish sauce you may like this recipe.  I did make a change and decrease the salt; I put in less than half the recommended amount, based on another review I read that said this was too salty.",
