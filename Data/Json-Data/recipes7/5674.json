NOTE: I'm a little confused at the recipe's ingredient list calling for condensed milk but the directions don't explain on what to do with it. I've never used it in this recipe before but I'm interested to see if it makes it any better than without it.",

I skipped the condensed milk since I didn't know what to do with it. For the shortcake cups I used the ones publix sells. Its usually next to the strawberries. I love this so much! Its like having a short cut to one of my favorite desserts with 1/2 the wait time! I used heavy whipping cream and added in 2 tbsp of sugar when I was whipping it. Next time I think I'll use the whipped topping cream in a can and see how that turns out!",
