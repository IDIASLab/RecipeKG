Put a bowl or dish on top of the cucumbers to press out the liquid. Let stand for a good hour or more. Mix up your dressing in the meantime--I always add fresh dill 1/3 cup or so and Fresh parsley also about 1/3 cup or so. Sugar to taste. I like to let the dressing and drained cukes meld so usually make this in the morning for an evening meal. Delicious with Steaks and Baked potatoes!!---I usually do my potatoes by slicing them into thick disks and inserting onion between each disk. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and fresh cracked pepper then drizzle with olive oil right into the foil packet. throw on the grill for 45 - 60 min---so deelish!",
