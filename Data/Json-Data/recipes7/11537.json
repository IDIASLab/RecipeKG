I'm not a big PB & Chocolate fan and I think the addition of the cocoa powder to the mix really takes that strong PB flavor down while still having an authentic flavor. The sugar helped make them a little chewy with a slight crunch that didn't complete crumble apart like other PB blossoms and all in all I would for sure make them again! Made a double batch in my Kitchenaid mixer bowl using the paddle attachment and had absolutely no issues.",

As I was rolling the balls I noted some of the chocolate/PB hadn't fully mixed. Partially because I kind of dug the swirled look and mostly because I\"m lazy I left them as they were with no issues. My only slight criticism is I had some breakage issues w/a few of the cookies when I pressed in the kiss (and they weren't overdone which would make the breakage make sense due to dryness). I used milk chocolate kisses because I'm not a dark chocolate fan and had about 15 kisses leftover from a \"regular\" sized package of holiday kisses. I must admit I was happy to not to have to find room in the already loaded dishwasher for the baking pans since I'd used the Reynolds (R) precut cookie sheets (which they provided but is not skewing my review; I'm not that easily bought...). THANKS for the recipe!",
