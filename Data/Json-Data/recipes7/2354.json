The texture is fluffy and light, with just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries (just a personal preference), and used a different crust recipe just because it's my favorite and I like to have crust on the sides AND bottom: 2 cups graham crackers, \u00bc cup pecans, \u00bd tsp cinnamon\n\u00bd cup butter (melted).  You also don't have to pre-cook this crust so I found it to be a time-saver.  Next time I might try to put a thin layer of the liquid raspberry sauce on top of the crust (under the filling) so it can seep into the crust during baking for some extra raspberry flavor.",

It has been a few years since I made it but this year I finally succumbed to my children\u2019s request.  I could not find my recipe but my research lead me to this recipe as it best matched my recollection of my former recipe.  The cheesecake turned out so well that I felt compelled to review this recipe because this technique is excellent.  The resulting cheesecake is so light and fluffy that you will feel as though you are not eating a sinfully delicious treat.  I substituted a chocolate-hazelnut crust by using 1 pkg of Famous chocolate wafers, \u00bd cup chopped hazelnuts, \u00bc cup sugar and \u00bc cup butter.  I crushed the wafers in the blender with the hazelnuts a quarter package at a time by using the pulse button on and off for about 30 seconds each batch.  After mixing in the butter and sugar, I pressed it into the spring pan on the bottom and the sides.  I substituted orange flavoring for the lemon with 1/4 cup fresh orange juice, finely grated orange zest from 1 orange and 2 tsp orange extract.  I followed the recipe's instructions explicitly and chilled the cheesecake overnight after I let it cool in the oven.  After removing from the spring pan, I cut the cheesecake with a knife that has been rinsed in hot water in between each slice.  I then serve with a drizzle of chocolate syrup",

Used 2 cups vanilla wafers crumbs, 1/4 pecans, 1/2 cup butter melted and teaspoon of cinnamon for crust, baked 6-8 minutes. ( my favorite crust ). like the other reviews said, there was too much filling, so I had a reserve pan ready to go and got another little cheesecake out of it! Added another tablespoon of lemon zest to filling, I like things extra lemon and tart, and it was perfect for my taste. This technique produces the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake I've ever made.

                "reviewBody": "I have never made a cheesecake before. Googled \"lemon cheesecake\". I started at 9 pm (Rookie mistake ... Oh how little I knew!) to cut to the chase, I made it right by the instructions. Baked it. Was afraid I had undercooked it. Surfed the net again and figured I might be ok.  I did add more lemon zest than the recipe called for. I took it to a party at my daughters house ... afraid. She had one from a bakery too. Next thing I know people are streaming from the kitchen raving about the lemon cheesecake. Was nice to admit that I had made it.  Had 1 piece to bring home. Will make again ... perhaps with oranges this time.  **** First timers ... notice it is a lemon souffl\u00e9 cheesecake *** texture is lighter and fluffier ... all the positive comments were that description. It was a whole lot of work, but fun in the end. Will make again!!",
