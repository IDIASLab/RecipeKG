                "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this! It was a lot of work though. I used a springform pan so I cut the amounts slightly. I ground pretzels in the food processor (about 1 3/4 c. total). I used 2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp brown sugar and only 6 Tbsp butter (but probably could've used a full half cup). While the crust baked I rinsed out the food processor and used it to blend the cream cheese and sugar then lemon juice and vanilla. Transferred to a bowl and stirred in the lemon zest. I'm not a fan of Cool-Whip so I whipped 6 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the cream cheese. Delicious! It was just the right sweetness (even with unsweetened whipped cream) with a great lemon flavor. I only used 3/4 c cream because I wanted to be sure the filling was firm enough to slice. While the filling chilled I BLANCHED THE KIWI. The gelatin won't set otherwise. I peeled and sliced the kiwi placed slices in a strainer and lowered it into boiling water. Blanched it for about 45 seconds transferred the strainer to an ice water bath and then set kiwi slices aside with the mango. For the gelatin I used the ice water bath from blanching the kiwi to chill the gelatin mixture until it was ready to pour on the fruit. My verdict? I thought the lemon Jell-O detracted from the rest of the dessert. Next time I'd play with using fruit juice (mango or passionfruit) and use 1 pack unsweetened gelatin. Just enough to make a shiny fruity glaze not so much for a floating gelatin layer. But I will try this again!",

I would cut down to about 1/4 cup; do 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon juice in the Jell-o; omit kiwi and add more mango (Kiwi reacts funny in Jell-o and it was a little runny); and I think it would be good even with a pineapple Jell-o and maybe some coconut in the crust even!",
