Original comment dated 11/21/12 - I was really hoping to take a sweet treat to Thanksgiving family dinner, but it is almost tasteless. Might taste better after sitting out all night. Did not tweak recipe; followed it as written. First batter was more like cookie dough. It did not pour out of bowl. Had to spoon out with spatula and spread on bottom of 9x13 inch non-stick metal pan. Baked at 350 degrees F. First layer definitely needs more baking time; didn't add it, though. Figured the next layer would bake bottom layer as well, even after adding 10 minutes then 5. It didn't solidify like cake. Dared not leave in longer as top layer started cracking. Taste-test was disappointing. Could be my spices were not fresh enough.",

I cooked it in a 9x13 pyrex dish at 375 for about 45 minutes and still feel like the bottom half could have been cooked longer. I'll definitely be leaving that half in the oven for at least 10 minutes before adding the top portion. Lastly felt like there was too much butter in the bottom half. I will try it with 3/4 cup next time.",
