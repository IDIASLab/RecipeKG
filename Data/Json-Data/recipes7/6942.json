I subbed in the last 1/2 cup with bottled lemon juice and it worked well. I put a lemon peel in with the hibiscus water to simmer and cooked only 5 minutes as hibiscus can get bitter quickly. instead of waiting for cool down for the last 1c of cold 3c of the cold water I subbed in ice and poured hot liquid over ice. In future I will triple (at least) batch and freeze some as ice cubes or in plastic water bottle to use in the pitcher to keep cold. Yum. Yum. Yum. Did I mention yum?",
