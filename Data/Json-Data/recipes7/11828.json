I found the sauce to be a bit too thick and \"cornstarchy\"...I will lessen that next time. It was delicious though and with a little minor tweaking this would be 5 stars. My 8 year old said it tasted like \"Chinese food\"...a compliment! ;)",

I adjusted the recipe a little, omitting the sugar, red pepper flakes and green onions. When I prepared the sauce, I gathered broth, soy and hoisin sauce with one teaspoon Sriracha with 3 cloves minced garlic and a full teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. I let the sauce mix and sit for 20 minutes while I prepared the chicken and veggies. Grilled chicken with S/P, sesame oil (not corn oil)  and half sliced brown onion .. removed from pan and in the same pan added all veggies with a little more sesame oil till wilted and cooked through. Added the chicken, sauce and corn starch till heated through. I served this over a bed of rice noodles instead of rice, it was a *HUGE* winner!!! Best wishes for Delicious Dishes ;)",

I did add more chicken broth after I added the sauce mixture. The sauce thickens up quickly and we prefer a \"looser\" sauce. Also took Diana's advice and increased the amount of soy sauce which I think enhanced the flavor. Will definitely be making this again using shrimp and more veggies.",
