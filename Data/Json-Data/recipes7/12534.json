I used avocado oil rather than vegetable as that is what I had on hand. I also used Stevia in place of the sugar. Reading the footnotes and liking spicy I used half paprika and half chili powder to add a little zip. It complimented the taco salad nicely with its sweet/spiciness. We really enjoyed this dressing and I will be making it again. Thank you Grandma39 for sharing your recipe.",

After tasting it, I also added some garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp. of habanera sauce (didn't measure, just shook bottle a couple of times) for a little added kick.

Poured it into an old store bought salad dressing bottle, refrigerated a few hours and the salad turned out with fantastic flavor.",
