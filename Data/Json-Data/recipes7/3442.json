I would slice them thicker next time. I halved the recipe and am now wishing I hadn't but since we will be going apple picking in the the next few weeks I'll be making a full batch of these! I'd never tried pickled apples before but decided to on a hunch that it would be a great topping for \"LaMama Raisin Burgers\" along with an applesauce or fruit based steak sauce. I'm just curious how long these stay good for as I am planning to make a large jar of these (like one of those HUGE pickle jars) so we have these on hand for snacking. I can't wait to find other ways to use these apples!",

It was an odd combination with the cinnamon and nutmeg. I'm not sure if it was included for help preserving but I think the vinegar will do that just fine on its own. I also wouldn't recommend using really tart apples I think sweeter apples go better with the apple pie type of spices this calls for. Since you're not cooking the apples the tartness doesn't have an opportunity to cook out and get sweeter as they would normally do with a pie.",
