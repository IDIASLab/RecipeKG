I was a little worried about the rhubarb being fully cooked so I went a head & poached it in boiling water for 10 minutes to make sure it was soft. (I had a pie not turn out so great before when I didn't know about poaching rhubarb.) This cake is beautiful! Some of the topping stuck to the bottom of the pan when I flipped it over but it came off easy & I just spread it right back on top of the cake. I also garnished the cake with pineapple rings since this is for Nana's 85th birthday. Thanks for the great recipe! A Keeper!",
