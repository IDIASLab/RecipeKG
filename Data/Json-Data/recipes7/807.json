I pureed a little bit of the salsa and marinated the chicken in that overnite to infuse a little bit of the plum flavor. I wasn't able to find haberno peppers so I used jalapenos and used less. I think next time I'll use the full amount as it wasn't as hot as I was afraid it would be. I added a bit of chicken stock to the pan as I cooked the chicken too. I'll make this again.

I am from Arizona and enjoy spcy foods but the salsa even with only two habaneros had a lot of heat to it. I pureed half of the salsa and cooked it hoping to mellow that hotness from the peppers and it worked a little but everyone agreed that the fresh salsa was much better. The salsa by itself is a keeper but on the chicken it really pops! Try this recipe and maybe use a less spicy pepper (although it might spoil the festive color!) and you'll be surprised at how tasty the two flavors are together!",

Made as directed salsa used 3 SEEDED SMALL habaneros in the salsa marinated in the fridge for an hour and it was NOT too hot. Had a little kick but worked well with the sweetness of the sugar and plums and tang of the cilantro. Marinated the chicken breasts in the salt pepper and fresh minced rosemary for about 30 minutes and since it was nice out I had DH grill them instead of pan frying. Was a nice surprise taste for the both of us he LOVED the salsa!! Did not make the rice or green beans but cooked an Uncled Bens boxed rice (Parmesean&Ramano) and sauted spinach in infused garlic olive oil. Made for a nice healthy and light summer dinner!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!! It's a keeper!!",
