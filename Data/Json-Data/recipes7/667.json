Instead of skim milk I used fat free half-n-half (I didn't want it to turn out \"icey\"). My bananas were frozen. I threw everything in the blender and let it go for a minute or so then poured it into a freezeable container. After it had frozen almost solid the first time I scooped it out and ran it through the blender for a second time. We just had this for dessert with chopped bananas on top this is quite good. The kids and I really liked it. Next time I'd like to add a little cinnamon and nutmeg and maybe use brown sugar instead of white then I think it would be like eating Banana Bread ice cream. This recipe's a keeper!",
