Simple to make and it keeps for 3-4 days. I grow cucumbers and one plant can have 10-15 cucumbers a day ripen. This is a great variation of the traditional cucumber salad. Add tomatoes for a different variation. If you use fresh ginger be sure to grate it fine and increase amount to 1 1/2 teaspoons.",
