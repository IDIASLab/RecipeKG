This was a huge hit by all.\n\nI did make a couple changes as well. First I used frozen peaches,  all I had. I loved the fruit topping! You don't need any syrup. Actually, I tried some syrup with too and didn't like the way it changed the flavor! \n\nI also addes some cinnamon to the egg mixture,  seemed to just go perfect with the peaches.\n\nNext I used confection sugar with the cream cheese which made it smooth. I also spread the cream cheese on one slice of bread then topped it with second slice and then cut the bread diagionally. Seemed a bit easier. \n\nI too used more than 8 slices, I think we used 13. I still had egg mixture left. I made baked oatmeal the next day with it, it was yummy too.\n\nWe totally forgot to use the whipping cream on top, it was so good even without it.\n\nThis was awesome - thanks for sharing your recipe!",
