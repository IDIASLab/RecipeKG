It's been in my recipe box for months to try and the entire time it's been rated 1 star; today it was changed to 3 stars. I'm finding that very confusing. The instructions for this recipe are perfect. The bread itself is a pretty plain egg bread and the filling is very easy and quick to make. I would add garlic next time and maybe halve the recipe itself without halving the filling bc this makes a lot of bread. It's just the two of us in this house though so for a family it would probably be fine. I didn't make a ring bc I didn't roll out the dough enough but I did twist it and it was quite pretty. Bf wasn't thrilled with the bread itself (he thought it was dry--probably my fault since I baked it at 375 for 45 min) and I think it needs more filling but otherwise this is a nice bread that looks beautiful when cut. I think it deserves at least 4 stars.:o) Thanks for the recipe!",

Everyone LOVES it & really looks forward to me making it every year now for Thanksgiving. I would advise letting the butter/poppy seed mixture cool in the refrigerator before spreading it on the dough. If it's warm it'll run into the edges causing the bread not to seal properly. Also I use 1/2 C butter instead of the oil. This bread smells so good baking too.",
