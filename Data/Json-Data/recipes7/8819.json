We have been experimenting with it more in recent years and have learned we really enjoy it, particularly when we're talking about recipes like this one.  Holy moly, what a salad!  No ordinary potato salad this!  It does require a little extra effort than most, but it's so worth it.  Just right tangy and sweet, with accents of parsley and celery that lend freshness, crunch and flavor. Given I made such a small portion for just the two of us, I was tempted to just toss everything together rather than try and layer  it as directed in the recipe.  I'm so glad I made it as the submitter intended as I'm sure that was partly why this salad was so beautiful, certainly a sophisticated cut above most potato salads, German potato salads included.  If I have one criticism it's that I didn't trust my instincts and use either a Yukon Gold or red potato.  I guess I assumed that if that wasn't specified then an ordinary russet was what was intended.  Just as I suspected, with the russet I used the slices tended to fall apart.  Still, the combination of flavors and ingredients in this salad far and away made up for any disappointment I had with the potato itself.",
