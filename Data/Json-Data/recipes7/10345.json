In addition to this, I also added 2 cardamom pods and a star anise both of which had the shells broken open prior to adding to the pot. It turned out great, and my apartment smells incredible.

I would suggest that if you have a blender or Magic Bullet, you can dissolve the sugar faster in that.  Then I brought the simple syrup ( one cup white sugar, one cup water) to a boil, and turned down the heat low.  I did not want to invest in expensive whole cloves or whole cinnamon, and I had ground on hand.  I put in half a lemon, sliced thin, and one quarter teaspoon each of the cloves and cinnamon. Covered saucepan and simmered ten minutes.  Added two cups Carol Rossi Paisano wine; this is inexpensive, mild and has a decent body.  I took one taste, and knew I had to make more.",
