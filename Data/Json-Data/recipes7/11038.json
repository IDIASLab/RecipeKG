If I were to rate this for the adults in my family it would be a 4-star recipe. It was good but nothing special. I'd just as soon eat my bacon on the side. The only modifications I made were: 1) I added a little extra flour to the batter because I thought it was too runny and 2) I cut the long bacon strips in have and made regular round pancakes around each.
