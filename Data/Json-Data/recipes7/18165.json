I like salt but this was way too salty and hubby agreed. He says half the amount, I say leave it out altogether. You be the judge on that. Okay so back to all the good in this. As the recipe submitter said, who knows what all you are eating in the store bought. That's not even my biggest gripe. The grease! When it is done you are left with ground meat swimming in bright orange grease. Grease that doesn't really ever drain. I have to actually rinse it to get a lot of the grease out and then obviously by doing that I am rinsing the flavor out too. Now I did have my butcher grind me some fresh pork but there was zero grease. Not only was there nothing to drain, I thought I was going to have to add some oil to prevent it from sticking. I could tell by the smell while I was cooking that this was legit. I'm telling you, the flavor is SPOT ON! Again, very impressive and one I will make often. Thank you for sharing mattredmond!",

                "reviewBody": "Flavors in the chorizo were very good. This was easy to make and so much healthier than store bought--no mystery ingredients and not swimming in grease as Soup Loving Nicole described! I didn't have New Mexico Chiles and subbed with Ground Ancho Chili. I cooked a small amount to see if I thought it would need anymore spices but it was perfect for us. I felt the chorizo was on the mild side but that's likely because of my pepper substitute. So if you want a hot chorizo just add more pepper but do cook a small portion of the mixture first before doing so. I'm sure it will be even better after it sits and melds more. Thanks for an excellent Chorizo recipe I can make anytime!",

I added fat to the ground pork butt I used, to make it more like traditional sausages,rather than the typical 80/20 ground pork in the big stores. I am not a fan of salivary glands used in most mexican chorizo found in the stores here, so using meat is better for me.",
