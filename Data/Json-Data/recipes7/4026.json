Jazz it up using fresh crushed garlic instead of the powder, at least 2 fat cloves, right at the end of stir-frying the egglplant (mellowing the garlic), along with some green onion.    For more flavor, add extra dash of oyster sauce and a good dash of fish sauce, a little more pepper flakes as well.    Goes very well with added thin-sliced pork/chicken/beef.  Just toss it in after you get the eggplant stir fryin' for a couple mins (takes less time to cook).",

It tastes so much better than with the garlic powder.  I used 2-3 bulbs.\n2) Ground pork tastes amazing with this dish.  I fried up the ground pork seperately to get some browning on the meat, then I drained the excess fat.  I added the whole thing to the eggplant mixture at the end of cooking.  Delicious.\n\nThanks for the recipe!",

By this recipe, the eggplant turns into mush. The eggplant chunks disappear. Here's why. Frying the eggplant for 4 minutes makes perfectly cooked eggplant. But when you add the water to the hot frypan, it boils explosively before it cools. Then you simmer, and the eggplant just turns into glop. DO NOT OVERCOOK THE EGGPLANT! The water won't be \"absorbed\". Instead, I recommend frying for just two minutes, cooling the frypan after frying, and adding all the other ingredients mixed together. Then simmer until the cornstarch starts to congeal. That leaves you with real chunks of eggplant in a thick sauce. \n\nBTW, to add some protein, throw in half a cup of frozen peas. Nice.",
