I gave 4 stars because it wasnt very sweet and it was really dense especially the chocolate part. I also baked it for less time then called for and it still came out a little dry. But... this sure beats those boxed mixes with aluminum in the baking soda. And this is a beautiful idea for a fall cake. I will definitely make it again..",
