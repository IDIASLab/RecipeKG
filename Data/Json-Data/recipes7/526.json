There was hardly any instructions on the recipe card and it is steamed in the oven but no oven temp was mentioned. I use one stock pot surrounded by about 4 C. water then put pudding into a smaller stock pot one inside the other steam at 250 degrees for about 3 hours. It is the most heavenly stuff! You wouldn't think it's rich but it is. About 3/4 C. per serving is usually enough and I make extra hard sauce to spoon over it but without the lemon. Thanks for submitting your version- it will help me to tweak mine. It does make the house smell divine!",

The only difference is she used brown instead of white sugar and also included 1 cup of grated potatoes in addition to the carrots. Also she went a little lighter on the nutmeg and heavier on the cinnamon. She topped it with a hard sauce with rum. That was made by boiling water and adding it slowly to dry ingredients with whisk. Pour it back into a pan and boil for 3 minutes to thicken. Remove from heat and add butter and 1 T of rum (or other). Specific sauce ingredients: 1/3 c. sugar 3 tbsp flour 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/2 tsp salt 3 cups boiling water 2 tbsp. butter 1 tbsp rum brandy or sherry). Yield 2 cups. YUM! A must serve wintertime treat. I'd be interested to know how you packaged your puddings for gifts -- I'd like to do that this year since I just bought some very cool antique steamed pudding molds on eBay.",

I steam it for about 3 hrs in jars in my canner. You have to be sure to only fill them 2/3 full as it swells a LOT. It is my fav Xmas gift to give away.
