I wasn't sure about mixing dry onion soup mix with toasted sesame oil, ginger and orange juice, but it was delicious! Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe except I used a very small amount of diced Vidalia onion (personal taste), a tiny bit less of the soup mix (was a little concerned about the amount of salt) and a little more orange juice (we love citrus dressings). For the chicken, we have an excellent little pizza/sub shop in the area with the best grilled chicken breast sandwiches. I called and ordered a couple of the breasts (plain - just salt and pepper and grilled) and picked them up on the way home. Easy and cheap! All of the flavors and ingredients just went together perfectly. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow for lunch. We will have this often. Thanks for sharing!",

My husband ate his leftovers right out of the container. The only thing I didn't care for was chewing on the bits of ginger and I thought it didn't really need so much oil. Next time I am going to cut the oil in 1/2 and use powdered ginger.  Thanks for great summer meal!",

The red are good but had a bit of a bite to them and green onions would work perfectly with the Asian flavors in this salad.  Also, I would use a little less sesame oil at first and add as needed.  It was a little heavy on the sesame flavor for me, but that could just be my taste.  Overall, solid recipe!",
