I was looking for something else to go with the chips -- I love nachos but unlike Mr. Pickypants I get tired of them -- and found this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly -- I have no tolerance for heat in my food so I omitted the jalapenos (and indeed that mere 1/8 t. of cayenne was at my threshold!). This dip is light and flavorful nothing like the heavy pasty stuff that comes in a can; and it took just a few minutes to make! Thanks PresidentJim; you have my vote! 3/10/2014: Just a couple of notes: If you drain the beans well you will get a thicker dip. And although you will think it needs salt don't do it! You'll get plenty of salt from the chips.",
