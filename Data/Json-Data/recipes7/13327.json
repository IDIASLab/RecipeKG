Was a little concerned about the amount of cinnamon overpowering the flavor of the vanilla Greek yogurt and the blueberries so I cut that in half which was perfect for us. The blueberries were very sweet so I didn t need any sugar. This was creamy fresh and was a welcome treat after doing yard work this morning. Missyfit I love smoothies and this one will be a regular in this house...very nice!",
