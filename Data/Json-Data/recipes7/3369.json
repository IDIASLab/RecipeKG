I could not find mochiko (didn't have time to go to an Asian market) but I followed the directions otherwise- except subbed teriyaki for the oyster sauce- and then just before frying I tossed the pieces with Panko. The whole family loved it- this will go on my 'make often' list for sure!",

The directions are a little sketchy on exactly how the whole dredging thing is supposed to happen but what I did was leave the Rice Flour out of the \"marinade\" and use that to do the pre-fry dredge. Not sure if that was the intention but it made for a nice crispy and light coating on this tasty chicken. I will definitely make this again. I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.",
