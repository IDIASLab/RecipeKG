Your egg whites need to be room temp when you go to whip them. I also use mint extract instead of oil. Do not over whip your eggs! Use an oven thermometer to check the temp of your oven. I have never had an issue with the oven temp and browning this way. I keep forgetting but I need to try this recipe with mini chocolate chips... I just feel they may mix in better. Also be gentle when folding in the crushed candy cane. Pipe onto a lined baked sheet using a piping bag or ziploc bag instead of dropping by tablespoon. These are pretty easy to make if you follow the directions and take your time.",

                "reviewBody": "I think this recipe needs some additional instructions and a little tweaking in order to make it work. Always use a glass or metal mixing bowl never plastic and make sure it's very clean. Also make sure you start with egg whites that are room temperature never right out of the fridge. If you get even a small amount of egg yolk in with the whites they will not form stiff peaks so be very careful when you're separating your eggs. You should not add the peppermint extract at the beginning since the oil will not allow the egg whites to stiffen properly. Add the extract AFTER your egg whites are stiff and only mix for a short time to allow the peppermint oil to distribute. Finally the oven temp is way too high for meringues. It should be set much lower maybe 200 degrees and baked for about 90 minutes. Don't open the door and allow the meringues to cool in the warm oven. Meringues should never be brown and if they are then the oven temp is too high. Meringues should be dry all the way through never chewy on the inside.",
