I would use Nellie & Joe's Key West lime juice instead of real limes to make it even easier (unless you're serving it to company) and I would probably use regular 7-Up instead of diet because then the sugar part is also taken care of for you. Also Mexican 7-Up uses real sugar cane which is what the original recipe for this drink calls for so even better.",
