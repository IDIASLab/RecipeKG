Don't know if it was exactly right but the soup was great! My butternut squash was a bit too old so I added more potatoes (3 medium-sized yellow potatoes total) and I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. The next day I garnished it with feta lemon juice and cilantro and that was awesome. Thanks for a great new flavor. I'll have to ask my Yemeni co-workers about this:)",
