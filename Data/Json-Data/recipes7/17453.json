It is full of butter and I enjoyed that buttery flavor and texture. If it is hot, though, it will have a tendency to break down because of the butter base. I did put sweetened coconut on the top, so that added more sugar to the final cake. The texture was delightful. If you like a light, fluffy frosting that isn't overly sweet, but full of buttery flavor, this is it.",
