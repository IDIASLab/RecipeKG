The directions are simple to follow. Do pay attention to not overfilling them. Some of them can start pouring out like a blueberry volcano! I added 1 cup fresh blackberries to the filling and used 1/3 cup sugar. I also made a glaze of powdered sugar and milk and drizzled over them as soon as they came out of the oven and then topped with sprinkles. They looked like spring treats. I will be making these again.",

I've never made a full-sized fruit pie before and in hindsight I probably should have tried that out first. I over-filled several of the pies and they leaked a bit of filling in the baking process. However when you bite into one there's quite a bit of empty space between the filling and the top crust. Dunno what caused that to occur. I think with a little more practice this will be a favorite of mine.:",
