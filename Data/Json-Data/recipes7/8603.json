I'm surprised there aren't more reviews on this one. :) My slight changes were: I added the honey to the yeast/water mix, and added the salt in lastly while adding in flour to make a soft dough. Also used salted butter, didn't seem to make a diff. Only thing is, if you get 3 dozen rolls their going to be pretty small. I got 18 and they weren't that big. 1.5 oz or so each. Seemed I needed to add in more flour at the end then called for but I did use bread flour instead of A/P. However, the end result turned out fantastic. I used my 10\" round Superstone (for deep dish pizza) to bake them and 15 rolls fit perfectly. Nice fluffy rolls. I will stress DO NOT sub dry for fresh Rosemary. You will probably leave a bad review if you do that but it will be your fault (just saying). Thanks CJ. My go to roll recipe here on out. :) Man, so simple yet delicious.",

I went with this recipe because it came with a video which I suggest watching if you've never made homemade rolls before. I made a test batch today to taste them and this recipe is a keeper. They are very good and the rosemary added a great flavor that wasn't over powering. This is my first time ever at making homemade bread and I am no Betty Crocker in the kitchen. These rolls were easy to make. I followed the directions completely. It seemed I did use a little more flour then called for. I just added very small amounts until the dough balled up and pulled away from the sides of the bowl like in the video. Be sure to have a thermometer on hand so you can get the proper water temperature so not to kill the yeast.",

I discovered him when I tried his meatless meatballs and anyone who can conquer something like that was worth following.  In the past I have not had good luck with dinner rolls, they were either too heavy, didn't rise, or didn't have good flavor.  These rolls were beyond amazing.  I couldn't believe the flavor that came from these.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I instead used 1tsp of dried rosemary and doubled the honey.  I thought it was going to be a flop because I needed much more flour to get the dough to pull away from the bowl, but I was patient and it worked.  I strongly suggest following the video instead of the instructions.  They are slightly different, and the video will keep you on point (as well as make you laugh)!  These were easy, and worth the effort!!!",

I made them for Thanksgiving but the grocery stores were sold out of fresh rosemary by the time I was able to go shopping. Instead I crumbled up some dried rosemary and mixed it with the milk and butter while it was heating on the stove so it'd rehydrate. It really incorporated the rosemary flavor throughout the bread. I think I'd do this even with fresh rosemary. Other than that I followed the recipe. I was only able to get 18 very small rolls out of this recipe so I would definitely at least double this recipe for a crowd. I'd love to try this with whole wheat flour.",

But when i started baking, the aroma alone was so rewarding! And 'as always' with all Chef John's recipes i have tried, it turned out perfect! My husband says thank you, Chef John. Now i am sure i am going to be making this every weekend.\nOf course, i didn't even attempt to make any changes to a 'Chef John's recipe'. I only used my favourite herb instead of rosemary. I only know its local name here (i am in Ghana, West Africa) so i might just post a picture of it later to see if anybody can help me with the name.",
