Also, a big pork shoulder does take a long time to smoke to the pulled pork stage, so don't blame the recipe if your smoker cooks slower than average. ALWAYS use a thermometer to check how done your meat is.  You can always smoke it for a few hours and then finish it in a covered pan or dish in the oven. Recipe as written is great, although I always add a little red pepper to my rubs. (just a personal preference)",
