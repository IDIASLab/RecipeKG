At first glance, they're pretty and inviting, just tempting you to pick one up and take a bite. The top of the cupcake has a slight crispiness to it, similar to a pound cake. The cake is moist and full of fresh flavor, tho' I did my best to ensure that by eliminating the lemon zest and adding 1/2 tsp. of strawberry extract. I did use the pudding mix and I swear it makes a difference in terms of moistness (and it's a much cheaper alternative to the cake enhancer King Arthur Flour sells).  I did alter the frosting as I wanted something sweeter and not quite as tangy as I knew only 1/2 cup of powdered sugar would make this.   I also wanted more of it.  So - I used  a full package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. strawberry extract and a tablespoon or two of pureed strawberries which gave it a delicate strawberry flavor and a pretty pink blush.  Rather than garnishing with sliced strawberries I used whole strawberries so they wouldn't bleed into the frosting.  Simply loved 'em - nothing about these not to like, particularly with the modifications I made for extra strawberry flavor.",

I used a little more strawberries to make the puree equal the 3/4 cups called for in the recipe. Also I ended up with 16 cupcakes. Baking time for me was 22 minutes cooling time was 15 minutes. These are simply lovely with a nice pinkish hue color. I did not add any red food coloring just let the natural color from strawberries show. I made the frosting using the whole package of cream cheese and added some pureed strawberries. I also thought the specks of the strawberries gave it a nicer appearance. Didn't have enough strawberries to top each of the 16 cupcakes with so next time I will make sure to have extra whole fresh strawberries. This is very FRESH tasting; the cake is absolutely moist. I know the pudding had a lot to do with its moistness so I am glad that I added it in. Reminded me of a pound cake only better and CUTER in these little cupcakes. The cream cheese is sweetened just right. A sheer delight and wonderful treat this is for dessert. A recipe that I would like to make again. Thank you drewface for sharing!",
