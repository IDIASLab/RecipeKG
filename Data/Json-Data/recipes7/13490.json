The celery root is important for texture though it doesn't add much actual flavor.   Be careful to not use all the dressing.  You can even cut that recipe in half as I tossed about 2/3 of it.  It's delicious but you definitely don't want to ruin this salad with too much dressing.  The fruits stand alone.  I will make this again.",
