I let it 'slow' cook for 12 hours till the 1 pm contest time and it was great. For the contest I added one long green pepper, one green pepper, more mushrooms, one Mild Italian sausage link. The rest was per the recipe. Comments were: nice texture, surprising to find pepperoni salami, great sauce taste, the mushrooms were a nice addition, sauce just hot enough.",

I figured this would be a great compromise.  I've made this a few times now.  My husband requests it often.  I usually make a double batch, but I use half ground beef & half sweet Italian sausage.  I use fresh mushrooms, and add extra, because the mushrooms are really stand-out in this recipe. I've used 1 can kidney and 1 can cannellini beans, but I think I'm switching to all cannellini, because they really are terrific with these flavors.  Now my family thinks of this as MY chili and it's not just the other family member whose praises are sung!  ",

I did change a few things and used spicy italian sausage in place of the beef fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned more chili powder added about a teaspoon of cumin a couple of tablespoons of minced garlic and used pepparoni sausages which were diced instead of using slices of them. Also threw in a chopped green bell pepper and some red pepper flakes. I cooked this in the slow cooker (cooking the meat pepper and onion the night before) and came home to a great meal. Even a friend who normally hates chili gave this one two thumbs up. Thanks I am sure I'll try this one again when in need of something chili - with a twist!",

I made this in the crock pot let it cook for 8 hours. I added garlic. These 2 things are the only differences otherwise I made the recipe as instructed. My husband and I both felt that this did not feel like chili. It felt like an awesome spaghetti sauce instead. It is also mild (but tasty) so if you decide to make this and desire spicy you'll want to add some extra kick to this. I am sad that we feel this way because all of the other reviews made me extra excited for this. Sorry though... next time I make it I'm gonna leave out the beans and pour it over noodles. Maybe it's just us but that's how we felt.",
