Be sure to use a wine that you would like to drink because even with all the sugar and flavorings the taste of the wine still comes through. I used a well-priced cab from Napa and reduced it to a syrup consistency. One change I will make for next time is to use a cinnamon stick instead of the ground cinnamon. Then I will fish it out before serving and not be able to see the \"grains\" of cinnamon in the sauce. This one is a keeper.",
