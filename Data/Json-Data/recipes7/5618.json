I used thighs in place of breasts sour cream in place of cream cheese and 1T of curry powder in place of paste because that's what I had on hand. The flavors all blended very well. I could see using coconut milk as well in this dish since it has a Thai flair to it. After cooking the chicken in the sauce (why bother cooking it separately?) I removed it and added about 3-4 cups of cooked brown rice I had left over from another meal to the sauce. Then I cooked them together until the sauce thickened slightly and the rice was heated through. Excellent! Adding this to our favorites list. Thank you!",

The maple flavor is really lost and really just acts as a sweetner. Heavy cream could probably be substituted for coconut milk. It's not stated in the recipe but if you use curry paste I recommend using red curry paste. I think if the maple flavor could have been more prominent it would have really stood out as a unique curry. However it really was just like any other curry.",
