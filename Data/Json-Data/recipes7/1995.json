For a richer Irish Cream Flavor double the Irish Cream to One (1) full cup and also increase the whole egg plus one egg yolk to two full eggs. I found no need to mix the egg yolk into the batter prior to adding the whole egg; just add the whole eggs all at once. With this new formulation the batter immediately after mixing is soft enough to be scooped into a piping bag and piped onto the cookie sheets. Done so baked for the recommended time makes excellent cookies with no need to refrigerate for hours and roll out the dough.",
