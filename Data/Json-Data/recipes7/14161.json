Woke up my century old San Francisco sour dough Wednesday, fed it and got it going, Sunday morning early I mixed in about 200 grams of very happy starter into 108F filtered water with a teaspoon of sugar, stirred it all up and incorporated the flour.  I let the batter sit for a few hours and when it was going off I finished the recipe exactly as called out.  We used a Belgian style griddle and came out with fantastic, light , crispy, chewy, sour deliciousness.  Unsalted sweet butter, Canadian maple syrup and macerated strawberries topped these golden beauties. Splendid, yeah I'll do this recipe again and again.",

Instead, I just used more starter than the recipe called for and cut back on the flour and water accordingly. I don't think I got the batter as thick as it should have been, and although the flavor was great, I think I'll try to follow the recipe in this respect next time in hopes of taller waffles. 2) I replaced the veggie oil with coconut oil... just personal preference. \n\nI served these with maple syrup and fresh strawberries... overall a delicious treat for a Sunday morning.",
