I already had my little hand mixer out, so I used that on LOW, in a tall glass measuring cup, to mix and incorperate the butter. Worked like a charm.  Crust was very easy to press into the pan without the usual \"slick\" sliding around of melted butter.  Since I was in a dire emergency situation, (if I didn't get something cheesecakey in my mouth soon, my head was going to explode!) instead of the fridge, I put it in the freezer for about 30 min instead.  Pie sliced cleanly and without any crumbling.  I'll use this one again.",

I do not like the box of already crushed crumbs but rather the more uneven type that you get when you use the rolling pin with the crackers in a baggie.  If I'm using Honey Maid brand, I use a packet and sometimes even add just a few more crackers so I have a thicker crust.  I do put it in a 350 degree oven for about five minutes to let the butter and crumbs come together.  Love this crust!",

It didn't have the overly greasy/buttery, too saturated crust that I got with pouring melted butter over crumbs. Using softened butter makes the butter spread more evenly among the crumbs. I got another tip on this site to place the graham crackers in a large ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to crush them, which yields smaller crumbs than doing it by hand. This makes for an even better texture. My brother specifically requested a sweet potato pie with graham cracker crust for Christmas and as he was eating this said \"I could eat the crust all by itself!\" Absolute winner!",

I only refrigerate for 30 minutes and used the key lime VII recipe.

I have made so many graham cracker crust and they are always too sweet and/or fall apart. I made this recipe just as written with no changes. This is the perfect graham cracker crust! My search is over! This will be what I make from now on. The softened butter is the key to this crust. Let it soften on the counter NOT in the microwave. After you have made your pie and chilled it, you should put a little hot water in the sink and hold the bottom of the pie for about 20 or 30 seconds in the hot water. It will be easy to cut and not stick to the bottom of the pie plate. Glass pie plate is best.",
