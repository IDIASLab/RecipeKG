But even without that there were no cracks at all! I am a skeptic no more. Now onto the crust - I didn't use gingersnap cookies as I'm not a fan of them and I had some leftover \"Guyanese Lime Cookies\" from this site. I crushed those up and next time I might put the coconut in the food processor or leave it out altogether. The crust is wonderful. The cheesecake itself is fabulous! It's divine and having two layers is GENIOUS! The flavors compliment each other vs. compete with each other. Some people thought it was thin or there wasn't enough filling - well if you have experience making cheesecakes you can tell by the ingredients that this isn't a NY style cheesecake that would contain at least (4) 8 oz. blocks of cream cheese. Double it if you must, but I do think that will take away from this dessert.  The mango coulis is delish and I wish I had made this while mango was in season as I had to add a bit more sugar to get the desired sweetness. I did follow CC's suggestion and topped this with some toasted cococut, lime zest, and some coconut flavored whipped cream (8 oz. heavy whipping cream, 2 Tbsp. white sugar, 1 1/4 tsp. coconut extract) which put an already incredible dessert over the top to ADP! Thanks CC for a great recipe! (As I write this review I'm actually enjoying a slice....)",

I loved how this came together and was one of the easiest cheesecakes I've ever made. I confess I didn't have the gingersnaps and didn't feel like making a trip to the store, so I used cinnamon graham crackers that I had on hand and added 1 tsp of ground ginger to the crumbs for that ginger taste that was such a nice compliment to the other flavors. In the coconut layer of the cheesecake, I also added 1/4 C of coconut to carry that flavor through. This is the first cheesecake I've ever made that I didn't do in a water bath. I followed the baking instructions exactly and it came out perfect. No cracks and very little settling. A wonderful dessert that just screams summer and one I'll make several more times before the summer ends for sure. Thanks CC, really, really delicious.",

I only have a 10\" spring form pan, but it still came out fine.  I used my food processor to crush the ginger snaps.  I've found that the finer the crumb, the better the crust sticks together.  For the coulis, I doubled the sugar and added about 5 tsp. water so that I could drizzle it (I just put it in a plastic baggie, snipped the corner off, then squeezed out decoratively).  Topped it off with homeade whipped cream and toasted coconut.  My guests thought they were dining at a five-star restaurant.  Well done, CC!",

And it works just fine; just replace cookie crumbs with cracker crumbs adding a tablespoon or so of sugar. For a \"ginger\" crust just add some ginger (and other spices if preferred). Another thing to do: You can buy frozen mango cubes at some grocery stores. Very handy. And I think I'll try using some coconut cream concentrate (a product from Tropical Traditions) instead of the coconut flavoring. No I'm not in sales for the company! I just love the product. It's concentrated coconut milk concentrated flavor but doesn't have the additives (and artificial ingredients?) that many flavorings have.",

Not too sweet, not too rich... a wonderful, smooth result that was actually done when the recipe said!  FYI, I could only find 14 oz. cans of condensed milk, but it converted to 10 dry oz.  You want 396 grams.  Thanks for posting this... it's going in the family book!",

                "reviewBody": "I was very disappointed in this crust. The ginger flavor was overpowering and the texture was chewy. I was embarassed serving this at a friend's house especially because the silence said it all. I think using half gingersnap cookies and half graham crackers would help the flavor. And because the moist/sticky coconut flakes seemed to overtake the texture of everything by creating a chewiness it would have been better to use unsweetened coconut (its a fine grated type that is dry) and added a tablespoon of sugar. There also seemed to be too much butter...I'd try using just 2 tablepsoons. I wish this had worked out better for me as I was very interested in making a different type of crust. I will try testing it out again with the above changes but make sure I do so before serving it to friends.",
