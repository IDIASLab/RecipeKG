It wasa little bit too sweet for me so next time i would probably reduce the sugar amount or use a less sweet chocolate. This is a winner made for a dinner party and admired by all. I served it with strawberries in cointreau which provided a good balance.",

After asking one of my friends she suggested using more egg yolks. So the 2nd time I used 8 yolks and kept all the other ingredients the same. It turned out perfectly! I do suggest getting the water in the pan and then turning the oven on to preheat. That way by the time you're done with the mixing the water is hot and this helps to bake the custard properly. Keep in mind more egg yolks means even more calories! Lol",
