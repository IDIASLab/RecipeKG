So many pasta salads taste too mayonnaise-y to me but the addition of the red wine vinegar gives this some tang. In the future I ll probably add a few chopped onions and cut back the basic salt but increase the celery salt a bit since that s a nice flavor in this salad. Garnished with some sliced olives for a little pop of color. notimetocook thanks for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it!",
