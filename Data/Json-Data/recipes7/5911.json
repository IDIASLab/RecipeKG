I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the melted butter. I have a child with severe food allergies(wheat eggs dairy and oat to name a few) I used to love to bake and now its like I'm learning all over again. Some recipes do not fair well with substitutes. This recipe was very forgiving and absolutely delicious. I used king Arthur's gluten free baking flour. Trader Joe's thick coconut cream for milk. Apple sauce for eggs. And earth balance whipped vegan butter spread in place of butter. I also used a little bit of the earth balance cinnamon spread because I didn't have enough vegan butter on hand. I just cut back on cinnamon in recipe. So good. Absolutely a main stay in my recipe book from now on. And the family loved it! I'll be making this for the holidays. Can't wait to try with the other variety of persimmons.",
