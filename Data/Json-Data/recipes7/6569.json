Mixed with maple syrup on top of buttermilk blueberry pancakes this syrup is yummy! Thanks goodeats! UPDATE: When I made this a second time I couldn't get it to thicken up. But I learned something from my friend Baking Nana who wrote this: Corn starch granules absorb water when heat is introduced and they start to swell and thicken the mixture. The solution reaches its thickest point at about 175 and 205 degrees F. As the cooking temperature reaches somewhere near boiling (near 212 degrees F) the starch granules swell to their maximum size and burst open. At this point most of the starch molecules escape into the recipe releasing the water that had been absorbed by them to be released back into the mixture resulting in thinning. So next time I will add the cornstarch at the end!",
