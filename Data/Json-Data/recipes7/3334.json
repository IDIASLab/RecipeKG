Anyway I used frozen snap peas and frozen regular peas and cut up some carrots - you could use any veg really. It's more about the sauce/flavor. And The only chiles I could find were the big ones (recipe calls for 16 dried red chile peppers cut in half) 16? That seemed crazy to me. So I simply cut up a big chile and removed the seeds. This part I will adjust because I like it spicy and this was on the mild side. I served it with minute Jasmine rice. And it was really good! Can't wait for leftovers:)",
