Rather than the cake being the top layer I opted to keep the whip cream on top to keep the cake moist and fresh. I like the lighter angel food cake in a trifle over a pound cake or yellow cake. This is great to whip up for a cook-out and elegant enough to serve to guests.",

I cubed the angel food cake.  I whipped my own cream with the recipe from this site that adds cream cheese so it's stiffer. I also used as many fresh strawberries as I could,  first allowing them to sit in a bowl after being sprinkled with sugar so as to create a sweet strawberry sauce. \n\nThis was so easy to make and tasted so good,  that it's going to be in heavy rotation at all parties and potlucks in the future.",

I used pound cake instead of angel food (because that was all they had at the store!) and I used fresh strawberries and regular (not sugar-free) vanilla pudding, because I already had them.  It was great! My daughter loved it. Similar to the strawberry shortcake my grandma always made us, but the vanilla pudding was a great touch. Will definitely make again sometime - it was very easy to do!",

Changes I made: I mixed 2 cans fruit cocktail drained and 1 large can sliced peaches drained and diced to the strawberries. In addition to the pudding I added 8 oz cream cheese vanilla extract and 1 can of condensed milk. To the cool whip I added the drained pineapples. I used small angel food cake cups. I placed a spoon of the pudding in the cake cup topped with the fruits and then the cool whip with pineapples. It turned out light and delicious. Thanks for sharing.",
