                "reviewBody": "What gives this recipe its distinction from other zucchini bread recipes is, indeed,  its \"spiciness\" - it includes  three different spices, not just the typical  cinnamon.  I generally (not always) see this combination of spices in pumpkin bread; not so much in zucchini bread.  It was  pleasantly spiced - nice, not overkill at all.   As for sweetness it has an appropriate level - not as sweet as some, yet sweeter than some others, therefore, this one should do a fairly good job at generally pleasing the palate.  I bowed out of the optional nuts but did add the raisins, a nice addition with the \"fall-ish\" spices.  I followed the recipe just as it directs, but for my needs a loaf wasn't practical; I baked a half recipe that produced  ten  nicely shaped and domed plump muffins - 350 degrees, about 25 minutes.  Happy to be the first reviewer and give this two thumbs up.",

I did cranberries and mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins and walnuts since I am allergic to the nuts and my kids don't like raisins. I also used about half the sugar because it isn't needed. But here is a secret I want to share: If you don't want your bread to be skinny on the sides and pointed on top as some have had trouble with don't grease the sides of your pan just the bottom. This allows the batter to stick better to the sides and rise up along with the middle. When you take the bread out of the oven put the timer on for 10 minutes to let the bread settle a bit. Then run a knife around the sides and remove the bread to a cooling rack while it is still warm. This is the secret to keeping it from sticking to the pan. Hope you enjoy this recipe!",
