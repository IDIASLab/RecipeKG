If unavailable, use Nathans all beef hot dogs or Hebrew national all beef hot dogs.  Regular American hot dogs will ruin the flavor of this dish as they are much too salty.  (The all beef american hot dogs listed above are a great substitution-not only are they much less salty but they have the red color reminicent of the asian hot dogs.)Also,don't use spaghetti sauce.  Use two bottles of Jufran Banana ketchup and 8-10 ounces tomato sauce.  Omit the sugar.  Only add the water if sauce needs thinning out. ",

I used tomato sauce instead of spaghetti sauce (the spices in pre-made spaghetti sauce are definitely not Filipino). American hot dogs are indeed too salty for this recipe. If I don't have the red Filipino hot dogs from the Asian market my husband also likes uncured hot dogs since they have less salt. I left out the water but it still came out a bit runny so next time I think I'll use some tomato paste along with the tomato sauce like previous reviewers suggested. All in all a good recipe that will be made again with stated modifications.",
