Divided the butter 1/4 c melted in a pan and the remaining I cut into small cubes and incorporated it into the flour mix before adding the milk. Lastly, cinnamon and nutmeg are a must to add flavor.(added to peaches while simmering). Baked in a 8x8 silicon pan and the end result was great.",

It seemed like a LOT of liquid and a LOT of sugar for that small bag of peaches. Well it ended up being delicious and very well received. All that sugar and butter created a caramelly flavor that was hard to beat My (tiny) modifications were to include a small splash of vanilla in the peaches bake it a good 10 - 12 minutes longer to a medium brown on top and around the edges and to boil the peach liquid down a bit (3 - 4 minutes) before pouring on top of the arranged peaches. So easy and delicious that I'll definitely make it again. Thank you!",

I had double the amount of peaches so I double the whole recipe except the sugar. I only used 1 cup rather the 1 1/3 cups. I also added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. I also made a topping of 1 cup of oatmeal, 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 cup of regular sugar. bakes up beautifully. As you can see they didn't give me a chance to take the picture before they were into it. GREAT RECIPE!",

Once as written and the second time I used a large can of peachs that I sliced up and replaced the water with the peach juice and one cup of fresh blueberries I still cooked them to get more flavor. I also replaced peach juice from the can for the milk in the batter. I lightly sprinkled sugar in the raw over it. One way was just as delicious as the other. I did cut back on the butter by half. It just doesn't need that much butter. I'd like to say that I served this with ice cream but it was gone before the ice cream got soft enough to dip. You could make any cobbler with this recipe. Just change the fruit up. I'm going to make apple cobbler next. Great tasting simple and inexpensive to make. What more could you want?",
