Especially great served warm and straight out of the oven! Best eaten a day or two after they're made though they will store for 3 days in an airtight container. Totally addictive and very much lactose free so they're easy to digest!",

I used less sugar than called for (4 tbsps white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar) used almond milk in place of lactose free milk substituted 1 cup all purpose flour for 1 cup whole wheat flour and only baked these for about 23 minutes at 375. I got 12 muffins and had a lot of batter left over so I put it into a 9x5 loaf pan and made a really nice muffin bread (it baked for about 33 minutes) in addition to the regular muffins! Thanks for the recipe!",
