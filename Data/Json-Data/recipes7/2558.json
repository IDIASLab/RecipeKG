Hit it with the handle of your knife or a meat cleaver, then tie it into a knot. Throw it in the pot and let it simmer then simply remove the whole piece before serving :-)",

I've never added the lemon grass and often leave out the cilantro and/or green onions and it doesn't seem to suffer.  also, I use full fat coconut milk.  Also, since the soup never lasts more than a day i add the noodles straight to it.  3/4 or so of the spinach seems like plenty to me.  All in all a great a forgiving recipe, thanks for sharing.",
