I doubled the oregano because it didn't seem like enough after tasting perhaps mine is aged and losing flavor. I might try fresh next time. I also eliminated the oil (personal preference). I had an open can of fire roasted tomatoes in puree that was a similar consistency to sauce so that is what I used instead. I ended up with two nice thick cups of sauce (one cup covered a large pizza quite nicely). I cut down on the salt due to the salt in the tomatoes but I will use the full amount with my unsalted tomato sauce.",

Sure there are fancier recipes but this turned out very nicely for such a simple-to-prepare recipe with so few ingredients. I made it exactly as written. (I'm not sure why the \"chill in refrigerator\" step is needed but I always refrigerated it for at least an hour.) One of my big concerns was the texture/spreadability of the sauce and it totally met my expectations. The first time using a 14-inch pizza pan the sauce was a bit too thick. After that the whole batch sufficed nicely for a 16-inch pizza. I may go on to try fancier pizza sauce recipes but this one is highly recommended.",
