I had to make a few changes to get these just right and they turned out delicious. I had to add about 1/4 cup of additional flour because the dough was rather runny. I also mixed in 1 cup of chocolate chips (who doesn't like chocolate-covered strawberries?!). I would also recommend refrigerating the dough for a bit to make for a fluffier nicer-looking cookie. Very good and I will be making these again soon. Thanks Brittany!",
