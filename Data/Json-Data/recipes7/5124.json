For the 9 inch deep dish pie crust I opted to use \"Baker's Secret Pie Crust\" from this site. I also subbed vanilla for the rum extract as I didn't have any on hand. I did use a little more cornstarch than called for which proved to be a good idea - there's nothing worse than taking the time to make a homemade apple pie and have it turn out runny... This smelled wonderful in the oven and tasted even better. It was hard to let it cool before cutting into it! Perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!",
