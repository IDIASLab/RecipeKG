Because I have a dough hook, I put all wet ingredients including the butter (I warmed it with the milk)...then the dry ingredients from smallest amounts to the largest.   Dough is slightly wet, and it would not hurt to add a little extra flour, perhaps a 1/2 cup.  \nI also egg washed (beaten egg with 1 TBL water)and brushed them.  The rolls shined  coming out of the oven.  Will make these again.  Urge you to give this a try.",

Watch the quantity though, this recipe makes 36 rolls which is a lot of rolls for a small family!  I cut the recipe in half and still got 20.  Also if you are having a hard time getting the dough to rise while in the bowl, heat up your oven and then turn it off and leave the bowl of dough to rest on top of your oven door while the door is open, it helped my dough to rise.   Will definitely make again!",

I had to stop the machine, divide the dough into two piles, and knead each one separately and then tossed them together in a bowl.  Excellent, excellent, and excellent! They are soft and pillowy and turn out HUGE!  I rolled my dough into the smallest of balls and they turned out the size of bakery muffins.  My one and only (minor) qualm: I will add more salt to the recipe next time.  Perhaps a half teaspoon and see how that goes.  Thank you though, these are the rolls I've been looking for!",

                "reviewBody": "These are amazing! A few comments for some of the problems others have mentioned below:\n\nIf you knead the dough it will get too chewy and  will  not rise as much. So seriously, mix just like you would a muffin batter, easy does it.\n\nButter your hands to shape. And use that flour you were tempted to add for working into balls.\n\nGo easy on the salt. Salt enhances flavor but it also slows the yeast growth down. Too much salt will kill your yeast and result in heavy dense roles that just don't rise. No more than 4 - 5 tsp.\n\nAbout that flour. Use All Purpose for these, not bread flour. Too much gluten give a firm crumb. The goal here is pillowy softness.\n\nHumidity and storage time can all affect how much moisture your flour  needs, not the other way around. Think of the dough like pie crust and wait until the final shaping to add additional flour. Just use a stout spoon to punch down. Again, no kneading!\n\nBig batch means more to freeze! After the final rise before shaping, scoop out as much as you want to bake right away and stash the remaining dough in the fridge. Shape and let the rolls rise. Now, Line a cookie sheet with wax  paper. Shape balls of dough and position on the paper without touching and put in the freezer. If you don't have room for multiple pans, stash the remaining dough in the fridge and set up a production line.\n\nCongrats you now have rolls, the making of monkey bread, breadsticks, you name it.  Store in a plastic bag or tub.  Thaw, covered and shape and bake.",

The dough was very wet. Not so easy to work with. I found out you can make these the day before and freeze.  I put them into a greased 8x8 pyrex dish and froze them just before the final raise. The next day it took about three hours to thaw and raise before they were ready for the oven. I don't know how well a larger dish would work though as the rolls in the middle took longer to thaw and raise than the ones on the outside. But they were delicious!",
