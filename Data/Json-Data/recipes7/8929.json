I was going to put whipped coconut cream on top, so instead of soy milk I put coconut milk (the watery part of the coconut can). Instead of canola oil, I put coconut oil, and instead of white sugar, I put coconut sugar. As flour, I used half whole wheat, half amaranth flour. I skipped almond extract. I definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks!",

This paired nicely with a vegan, vanilla buttercream and fresh berries. \n\nI frosted it the night before and promptly refrigerated it. No issues with the cake or frosting. I may try adding vegan cocoa powder next time for a chocolate cake.",

I substituted half the 'milk' for applesauce (and left out the 1/4 c water) - increases moistness and provides an element of binding in egg-free baking.  I frosted the cake with orange butter creme and it was richer than an all chocolate cake would have been :)  It's so easy to make that I'll stop and make a cake for one of the kids in a quick 10 minutes of kitchen time.",

I tore up a paper plate and put small amounts of the batter on the two plates and both rats when after I put it up to their lips-when I went to put it down grabbed onto it!..for Frosting I used a recipe from 'Vegan Cupcakes take over the world' made by mixing 1/2c Earth balance, 1/2c Spectrum, 3.5 cups of organic confectioners sugar, 1 and a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4th cup of soy milk-all blended well together.",
