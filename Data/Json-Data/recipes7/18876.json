I used the beater blade and then when it came time to knead put the dough hook in and let it go for about 10 minutes. Initially I thought this bread was going to be dense but the texture turned out just about right. You get a nice bite of chocolate from the chips (wouldn t recommend using the mini chips). I think in the future I ll add more cherries since the chocolate overpowered the cherries just a bit. Made no changes in ingredients or amounts and ended up with two loaves measuring about 7 diameter. Nothing not to like here good stuff!",

                "reviewBody": "I agree, it is much easier to make in a stand mixer. I roughly mix with a spatula, then finish off with the dough hook, never using a regular beater blade. \n\nA full recipe makes a single 9x5\" loaf pan, risen about an inch over the top. Cook 45-60 minutes to an internal temperature of >195F. Check after 30 minutes to see if the top is browned enough to need tenting with aluminum foil.\n\nA nice alternate filling would be chocolate chips (about 140 grams or 3/4 cup), dried apricot (~120 gr) and crystalized ginger (~80gr) diced to about 1cm cubes or strips.\n\nThe fruit and/or chocolate can be added midway through or after the first rise, sprinkled on the dough as you do envelope folds on it, though it may need to rest a bit after a few folds. This allows you to make a double batch with different fillings using minimal extra dishes. The second rise may need a bit more time because  of this extra handling.",
