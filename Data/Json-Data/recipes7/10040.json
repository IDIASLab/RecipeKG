I went to the cupboard to pull everything out and didn't have a can of pork and beans.  I guess I should have known . . .I don't always keep those on hand.  I forged ahead anyway and used more bacon than called for but added maple syrup and a sweet peach salsa instead of the white sugar to the mix to add more liquid.  I also added garlic to this and put everything on high for about 4 hours.  This worked out really well and my company loved it; next time I'll try with actual pork and beans. I love that this goes in the slow cooker; makes it super easy.  Thanks for the recipe!",
