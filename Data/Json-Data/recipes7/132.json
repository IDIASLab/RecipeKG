This is a five star recipe with a few changes besides the obvious salt.  I used olive oil vs. canola - about half of that.  In addition to the 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes I added a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce and used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste vs. the tomato puree.  I also sauteed the onion in 3 cloves of garlic and left out the garlic powder from the sauce.  I cut back the black pepper to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 c. of red wine. This is a wonderful thick, rich sauce.  I served it with homemade meatballs and sausage.  It's even better the next day! ",

If my basic math skills haven't failed me my calculations say that this has less than 2 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving. Perfect for me. Plus MUCH better than any jar sauce I've tried!!!",

Instead of garlic powder I used frozen garlic cubes that I get from Trader Joe's (1 cube = 1 clove). Used 4 cubes as we love our garlic. Accidentally left slow cooker on high for the first few hours but after a good stirring & another hour & 1/2 on low it was lovely & thick with a rich tomato flavor.. so perhaps that was a happy accident as we were able to eat a bit sooner. I'd actually cook it that way next time too. An excellent topping for thick-gauge spaghetti & wonderful partner for Meatball Nirvana meatballs (which are a must-try!).",
