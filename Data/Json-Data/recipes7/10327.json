I used a gluten free spice cake mix in place of the regular yellow cake mix due to gluten intolerance in our family. The spice really complemented the flavor of the pumpkin. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Cooking time was a little longer than an hour. This will be a family favorite for years to come. Thanks!",

This is definitely a keeper & one I will be baking several times throughout the year. I prepared this recipe substituting Splenda for the sugar (hubby is a diabetic) and used a butter recipe cake mix (didn't have a yellow cake mix in the pantry) but all other ingredients were as the recipe called for. I used the toothpick method to test for doneness, and yes it took longer than the 60 minutes the recipe states to bake, but seriously people. I baked mine an additional 6 minutes and it tastes wonderful! Every baked recipe needs to be adapted for your particular oven right? Long story short, this is an exceptional recipe! Next time I bake it I will use a yellow cake mix and still be just as pleased with the outcome! My family happens to love pumpkin pie but some do not care for crust so this is a win win in my book! Thank you!!!",

Now that's not the greatest thing for me since I'm not the biggest fan of pumpkin pie but I know a lot of people are so we can discount my opinion. I think it's the texture since I like the taste of pumpkin. At any rate this used up a lot of stuff in my pantry. I had two 15 oz cans of pumpkin so had a bit more pumpkin than called for and didn't have yellow cake mix so I used vanilla. Still this worked really well and tastes like a basic pumpkin pie. It makes a ton and I'm hoping my sister in law and nieces like pumpkin pie since I plan to bring a lot of this to their house when we go over to give them our presents. This is incredibly easy to make; just be prepared to leave it in the oven longer than stated. Mine took an hour and 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",

It really is JUST like pumpkin pie!! I was skeptical about this one as I was mixing it and as it was baking.. it puffed up like a cake and I was thinking.. oh no.. something went wrong.. but after cooling.. it settles and ends up the consistency of pumpkin pie. Like pie with the crust on top! My son who loves pumpkin pie and always leaves the crust will LOVE this. I just put them in the fridge to cool all the way I am taking them to a party later.. going to bring whipped cream to put on top. Thanks Rose.. this is really great. I may make this at thanksgiving instead of a pie! For one thing it serves more people!! It's a HUGE pan! I will say mine took 1 hour and 25 min to cook like the others and it still \"jigged\" some when I took it out but was set. As it cools it comes together. Awesome.",

The instructions were confusing and there should have been a warning not to use foil store-bought pans. I was taking it to a BBQ so I used a throw-away cake pan which could not hold the heavy batter. As I put it in the oven the cake pan buckled. I don't have to tell you what I did for the next hour! It was an expensive recipe and a total disaster that could have been avoided with a caution to use glass or metal cake pan due to weight. I cleaned my oven called it a day and went back to bed.",
