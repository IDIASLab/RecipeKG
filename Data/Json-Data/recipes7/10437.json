I did not include the turkey as I thought the ham was enough.I had to make some adjustments by using some ingredients but in different form or substitute. I had no Asparagus but had Asparagus broth in my freezer. (I keep a variety of broths in my freezer. They come in handy) So I substituted the cup of water for 1 1/2 cups of Asparagus broth. I used frozen peas instead of canned. I try to stay away from processed foods as much as possible. I did not have Red potatoes but had some beautiful Russet potatoes with nice skins so I kept skins on. I really enjoyed the butternut squash in this soup. This will be a new soup to make on regular bases.",

I am not familiar with cooking whatsoever so having this recipe and the easy directions made it so easy...with that being said it never said anything about taking the bayleaves out after adding them so they stayed in the soup so that was a bummer because I had to pick out the leaves that were crumbled in there. So rookie mistake I know but I would definitely make this again. Loved it and I didn't change a thing!! For some reason it won't let me rate it but it's a 5 in my book.",
