Two, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Three, I used orange juice instead of lemon since I didn't have lemon juice at the time.  It made for more sweetness!  Four, I found a crumble topping recipe and used that instead of pastry topping since I had a pre-made crust.  SOOOO good!",

I did substitute my preferred pie crust (called Foolproof Pie Dough, submitted by me on this site) but the filling was pretty much as stated, except I did use 3/4 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, as I had a good portion of tart fruit.  I did do an egg wash on the crust before putting in the oven so it came out a nice golden color.  I would recommend doing that.  I did add the sugar after as well.  Next time, I may do it before baking.\nThe apricot filling was a bit watery when I was mixing it together, so I added a heaping tablespoon of corn starch.  I also sliced the apricots into small bits rather than quartering them.  After it was baked, it was still quite watery (but the crust was not soggy) so I think next time I will put in more corn starch or replace the flour with Instant ClearJel.  \nThe taste, though, was perfect.  Not overly sweet and not too tart.  All in all, a good use of the fruit I had!",
