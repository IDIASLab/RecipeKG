Zest both of the lemons and use the zest in the batter, but don't even cut into the 2nd lemon (save it to use in something else). I only juiced 1/2 of a lemon, and didn't even need it all. Step 4 should state to add the lemon juice 1 tsp. at a time until the desired consistency to drizzle is achieved. I would also add to fill the paper cups 2/3 full. I filled mine more like 3/4 full, and it was a tad too much in my opinion. I also got 15 muffins filling them 3/4 full. My paper liners stuck a little bit, so next time I might just skip the paper liners and just put the batter right in the muffin tin (sprayed with BakeEasy\u00ae or Pam\u00ae).",

I made a simple lemon syrup by heating 1/4 cup regular sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice in a small pan until the sugar dissolved and it became very syrupy. Then let it cool just a few minutes to become thicker (not so drippy) and brushed it on the warm muffins with a pastry brush. There was a beautiful sheen that wasn't clouded by all that confectioners sugar.",

My family doesn't eat sugar so I substituted the sugar for fructose (you can find conversions of sugar to fructose online). My finding any buttermilk, I just put in whole milk and then added some lemon juice to that (about 2 tsp) I also added a lot of lemon juice to the batter. Just go by taste! I only cooked them for 10-15 minutes. For the glaze I didn't have powdered sugar, so I made some out of cornstarch and fructose, and then added the lemon juice. You can combine those 3 together instead of doing powdered sugar. I would definently recommend MORE LEMON! They were sort of bland, so Just dump it in to the glaze and the batter :)",

I made extra glaze and the family went bonkers soaking them in it and making them disappear before these muffins even had a chance to get cold. We WILL be making these again soon except next time I'll make a double batch. I sadly did not have a lemon and it was not convenient to get to the store so I substituted dried lemon peel and a single drop of lemon extract in the muffins and then used ReaLemon juice for the glaze. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Next time hope to use a real lemon as the fresh grated peel requested in the recipe will most likely give them a bit more lemon flavor than mine had. Still they were awesome! Thanks for sharing this. I love a beautiful moist muffin with a warm cup of tea. Note for tea room/party planner: As moist as these were this recipe would probably be great as small bite-size muffins for use at a tea or for a party platter. In my silicone muffin pans they popped right out too!",
