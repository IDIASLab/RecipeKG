It would have been tastier with more salt but I know I really shouldn't add more for a healthful recipe so I'll be checking out other possibilities for seasonings to give it a bit more zip. I did like the addition of celery and find the combination of garbanzo kidney and green beans to be my preferred combination in a bean salad. I like making my bean salads a day ahead and placing them in a plastic canister with a tight-fitting lid so it is easy to invert the canister and re-distribute the dressing every time I go in the refrigerator. It makes for a tastier salad without needing to marinate it in excessive amounts of dressing.",
