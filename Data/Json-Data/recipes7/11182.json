It says 1 tsp above but then talks about adding 1 tablespoon at a time. Don't let that scare your off.  I used 3 tablespoons of vanilla, adding it to the dry ingredients - it came perfect so I would say add vanilla to your taste. Also, I used fresh cranberries, white chocolate chips, and milk chocolate chips. I also used 2% milk because that's what I had. I don't press down on my scones before baking because I like that rustic look. Try this recipes, it is wonderful and flexible. Thank you for sharing it KLang436!",
