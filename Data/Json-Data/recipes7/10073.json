In my honest opinion using protein powder or similar nutritional supplements to smoothies that are not whole food ingredients gives a smoothie that vitamin like after taste. It dominates the flavor. This was no exception. I was able to save it by tossing a frozen banana in at the end hence my higher rating. It did remind me that I need to remember to add flax meal or similar foods to my smoothies.",

My protein powder is delicious and did not add any 'artificial' taste. Quite on the contrary it enhanced the flavors. This is a delicious smoothie that I will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe!",
