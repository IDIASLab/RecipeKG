Very few ingredients and the ease of using an air fryer make this a nice change of pace from regular home fries. The most tedious part is peeling and chopping into small pieces, but it's worth it!  My air fryer only goes up to 390F so that's what I used. Since air fryers can vary with cook times, keep an eye on these. I took mine out at 11 mins and they were perfectly done and nicely browned. This would make a great base for a breakfast skillet!",
