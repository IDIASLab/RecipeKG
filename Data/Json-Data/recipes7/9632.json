        "description": "Use the meat and veggies you have on hand, or stick to cabbage and peppers for a quick, flavorful, and basic stir fry. Hubby and kids gobble this down before a pretty photo is possible! Serve over rice. This provides 4 people with enough for second servings or a great next-day cold lunch. Chicken, pork, or seafood works as well as beef. Add extra veggies as desired except for more brassicas. Can replace cabbage with broccoli if desired. Great 'whatever's in the fridge' stir fry. Enjoy!",
