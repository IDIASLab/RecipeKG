It is great for freezing, canning, or just eating as soon as it is prepared, warm or cold. Everyone who tries it loves it. It makes great gifts in decorative canning jars!",

Try it on pound cake.  mmmmmm.....\n\nOne suggestion I would make is to save some time and use an immersion blender near the end of cooking - that saved me a lot of time chopping the apples finely.  Big chunks of apple cooked down very well, and then I was able to blend it to just the consistency I wanted.\n\nWe canned most of it, froze some, and ate some.  I didn't have enough rhubarb to double the recipe, so we did about a batch and a half, and our total was around 6-7 pints.  Nice recipe.",
