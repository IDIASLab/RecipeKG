They did not know the difference of course but I did. So I have a question; After the egg mixture is finished and ready to build the tiramisu with can I add marsala afterward? Will it curdle my cream mixure? I had some left over and I would like to use it but not as it is at the moment. Help! UPDATE: Well I ended up making a second cream for the tiramisu doubled the marsala in it and then slowly incorporated that cream to the first one that had marsala omitted. It came out wonderfully smooth! Thank you!",
