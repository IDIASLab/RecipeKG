Sure - they did cook thru (a little extra time for my oven) and the sauce does have a nice flavor but the fat from the meat thinned the sauce out so much that after all the basting there wasn't any evidence of it after being served. Personally I like my barbecued meats to show the evidence whether it was a dry rub or a 'wet' sauce such as this recipe.",

We also cooked on the grill between 280-300 degrees for 4 hours (really could have gone another half hour to reach perfect fall of the bone melt in your mouth tenderness but it was getting late). Seasoned the ribs lightly with a salt-free grilling blend then basted lightly with the sauce as it cooked and topping with the rest at the end. The sauce is good if on the tart/tangy side and does have that catsup flavor; not bad unless you prefer a sweeter BBQ sauce.",
