Again a fabulous tender result. Thank you for this great recipe.",

When fresh garden vegetables are on hand I add things that we love such as asparagus, cauliflower or broccoli. I love to switch it up to make it seem like we aren't eating the same thing over and over,  plus this is a great recipe for diabetics like me. I use one small potato per person and we're fully satisfied when we leave the table.It's fantastic no matter how it's prepared. I highly encourage everyone to try this one! Thanks for sharing it!",
