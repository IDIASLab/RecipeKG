Especially if you add a protein, as I did (shrimp).  \n\nSecond, don't let the dressing's taste scare you before you actually dress the salad!  It's definitely meant to be paired with the pickled vegetables.  \n\nI made this recipe in steps and while the rice was a little dry (it had been refrigerated overnight), it was nice to be able to do pieces here and there.  My pickles were refrigerated for a little over 24 hrs and they were still crisp and delightful.  \n\nUltimately, this still gets three stars because the flavor profile is just a little too tame.  I served the salad cold which does dull flavors a touch but I'd say maybe a little more chili paste.  A little more lime juice.  Just some overall kick!",
