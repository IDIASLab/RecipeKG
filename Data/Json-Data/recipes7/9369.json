For my love of peanut butter & the ease of recipe I tried it. Followed recipe except I used crunchy peanut butter as thats what I had. Made it with my children who loved it as well as I did. It has a taste of slightly salted & sweet at the same time. We all loved it at my house. I'm certain this will be a recipe that gets passed down in my family as well. Thanks for sharing it.",
