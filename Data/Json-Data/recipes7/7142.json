You will have to build with your own selections of spices to get it to the level of pizzazz. I needed black pepper celery seed and celery salt.

I mean come one it's 2 Tbsp and 1/4 cup for a full recipe and light mayo doesn't cut it for me. I might go with 2% on the milk but why? I used green onion and rice wine vinegar in place of the white. I also used bagged coleslaw so sue me! But one tip I learned and applied here is to dice up the cabbage and carrots really small like at KFC. So I dice the bagged coleslaw not just toss it in as it comes from the bag. The smaller dices really make a differnce in the flavor profile. Try it!",

I did add your typical celery seed and celery salt as I don't think a cole slaw recipe should be without it. We just couldn't get past the vinegar taste in this one. Maybe only 1 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar would be enough. Two tbsps. of 2 different vinegars is just way too much. So glad this wasn't served to friends or family. Had to add a little mustard to kill the strong vinegar taste. This recipe to us needs some tweaking.",
