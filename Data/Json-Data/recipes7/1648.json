A big change was that with an internal thermometer at 250 degrees mine was done in only about an hour. I had wrapped a 2 foot long log in foil and punched holes in it to keep it from drying out. Maybe since it was a smaller diameter and wrapped it was ready sooner. It seem very moist so I raised it on a cooling rack and put it back in the oven for another 30-45 minutes. This dried out the exterior but the inside was the right consistency. Other than a little lacking in intense salami flavor a nice addition to my l;ist of venison recipes.",
