I\u2019m not sure how this makes 30 rolls though, unless they are tiny, which is the only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5. I made a dozen with this recipe and they are the perfect size. The only part of the recipe that would have been enough for 2 pans is the frosting. I love sweets, and the frosting is delicious, but use sparingly as the rolls are pretty sweet on their own.",
