The submitter told us to play with the ingredients to make them to our preference so I did. I made it per the recipe the first time subbing in Splenda and skim milk and found it too weak in flavor and watery. The skim milk could have been the reason for the thin watery taste. The next time I used a mixture of fat free half and half and skim milk added instant espresso powder doubled the cocoa powder and used only 4 ice cubes. It was stronger in flavor but still watered down tasting...but better. For my taste I believe the ice cubes dilute the milk too much so a full fat milk is definitely needed. I'll keep playing with this recipe though because I think it has potential.",
