I would think some raspberry extract would work well in this if you don't have the Chambord. Didn't have any raspberries so I substituted some green grapes and I literally forgot the almonds (think they'd be a nice addition). This was a great dessert on a smokin' hot Florida day! The summer fruits are starting to come in season so bring on the fruit salads!!",
