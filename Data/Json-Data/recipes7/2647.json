I was worried they'd be hard to chew but they wern't; tomorrow they may soften up a bit more but I like them as is!.. I rolled about half in the coconut and then some in chocolate sprinkles and some in powder sugar; I also used \"Lindt 85% Cocoa Bar\" (melted) instead of baking chocolate because I had some. I added about 1T of rum in the last half of the batch for the grownups; the rum/powder sugar ones were my favorites! Thanks I'll make these during the holidays!..",
