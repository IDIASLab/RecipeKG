I made a couple of modifications to the dressing:  - cut the sugar out completely, I felt the cranberries, sugared almonds and apples were sweet enough - reduced the oil to 2 Tbsp. since the avocado, cheese and nuts also blend in as oil/fat components when tossed I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I used chevre goat cheese; red onion and baby field greens also worked great.
