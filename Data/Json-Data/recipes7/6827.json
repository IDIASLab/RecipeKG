Used almond milk in place of regular milk, and it came out better that way--the almond flavor really complements the other ingredients in the pudding. Used pear in lieu of apples. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to use a wider pan to have more of the crusty top, rather than the softer bottom portion!",

I skipped the butter since I was already using whole milk and I used Granny Smith apples and tossed in an extra one since I needed it finished off. I didn't realize it would still be quite sweet even with the sour apples that I highly recommend trying. However my family usually eats little sugar--okay except for my school-aged girl who eats candy daily (sigh) although she too thought it was too sweet! Shocker! I was also serving it for a crazy-day's dinner though so a sweet main dish was a little foreign to all of us.;) Good stuff though. I've been enjoying it ever since for a quick treat or meal as I had made a double batch. I can see it being perfect for cold winter days.",

My most impressionable years growing up I was raised in a Mexican Household Bread Pudding was made around holidays and at times we ate it as a dessert. My Mexican God Mother made it with Peanuts Raisins and Chopped Apples. My Grandmother made it with Raisins coconuts shreds chopped apples. I have included a picture with this review I tripled the recipe. I use my God Mother's recipe with the peanuts some people that have a peanut allergy use coconuts shreds. two apples chopped and raisins. I am diabetic so I removed the sugar and use Granulated Sucralose zero calorie Sweetener or Splenda the measurements cup for cup Like Sugar. I fooled everyone after they finished eating it I wait for all of the compliments I tell them all \"it was Artificial Sweetener\" that was used to make the Bread Pudding! \"LOL\" I get a kick out of that every time people have eaten my Bread pudding.",
