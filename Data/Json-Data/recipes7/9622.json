I skip the shrimp since my wife isn't a big fan and double the chicken, BUT... I use chicken thighs, cut into small pieces and then marinate overnight in sweet soy sauce, sesame oil and Sriracha chili paste. \n\nWhen it comes to the egg, I like using duck eggs if I can find them and I also add broccoli, diced red pepper and chopped cashews. Also, always make the rice a day or two ahead and leave uncovered in a big bowl in your fridge. It will dry out and you then break it up with your hands before adding to the dish which makes much better fried rice. \n\nSuper delicious!",

The first time I increased the bacon amount but did not reduce the amount of bacon fat left over (which made it greasier). Also the first time I did not have my chicken thawed so I skipped that part. Anyway use S/P to taste (mandatory - or it can be a bit bland). Anyway if you follow the recipe (adjusting seasonings to taste) this will be AT LEAST as good as what you get at your favorite Thai restaurant. THANK YOU to eatvancity for the submission - 5 stars for sure.",

My husband is Celiac so this recipe works really well for us since all I have to substitute is the soy sauce for gluten free soy sauce. I do a little tweaking in the times and the temperature at which I cook the meal but at the end its always turned out great! I always cook my rice in a rice cooker I never add as much water as the rice calls for (whether I am cooking stovetop or in a rice cooker) add a little bit of salt and oil and it makes the rice taste great and it has a nice texture to it I personally have never had to leave the rice overnight.

Too fun and super bonus is your kitchen smells wonderful as this cooks. Tweak it as you wish with added veggies the basic recipe is a terrific jumping off point. Our kids have Christmas meals with several other families and it's always fun for them to enjoy something different when they come and celebrate at our home and this fits the ticket perfectly!
