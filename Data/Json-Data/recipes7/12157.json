Even my husband was pleasantly surprised, and he's not a GF eater, and usually passes on any baked goods I make GF.  I did not add the sugar, but wish I had. It helps to brown the crust.  That being said, I did something to keep the crust nice and crispy on the bottom, as other crusts I've  made have just been mush after cooking with a fruit filling.  After pressing crust into the pan, I brushed on some egg-white and baked the bottom shell for about 8 minutes in a 400 degree oven.  Immediately after taking out, I put the apples in it and topped with the top crust, which I also brushed with egg white, and sprinkled with sugar.  Nice crust that closely resembled a wheat crust. My husband even said, \"MMM, that's good!\"   Thank you for the recipe, as I think pie crust is the hardest thing to get right in GF baking.",
