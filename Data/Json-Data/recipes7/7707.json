The instructions didn't mention whether to add the syrup in with the fig preserves, and I was worried it would make it soggy, so I strained the figs before adding. I should have included the syrup, or at least some of it. The cobbler was delish but a little dry. I will def make it again and include the syrup.",

He likes more of a fig jelly. Anyway, thought I could use them up in this dish..... seemed perfect, because this particular fig preserve recipe called for cinnamon and cloves. Which translates into great cobbler ingredients for me!  I used a 8x8 casserole and 3 8oz jars of the figs with most of the syrup. It seemed thin at the start, but came together. The BF said it was, \"Heavenly\". Thank you, will make again",
