Resort owner Sue King's pies are famous to the locals, and her pies have even been written about in Sunset Magazine! Fresh strawberries in a glaze are spooned over a baked pie crust covered in sweetened cream cheese. Can also substitute peaches for strawberries and use orange juice to make peach pie, Rock Creek-style.",

The cooked mixture thickened up nicely on the stove until the lemon juice was added. It did thicken up a bit more in the frig but was a liquid mess to try to serve. The cream cheese layer kept the crust from getting soggy at least until the next day. The taste was great though. I would not make this again without a few tweaks but then it would be a different recipe. Thanks for the recipe.",

Used my juicer to make strawberry juice didn't have quite enough strawberries so some of the juice was from an apple. Like other reviews mine was a gloopy mess that needed to be served with a spoon not a spatula. I just found it quite tart wished for more of the sweetened cream cheese...maybe too much lemon juice?",

By luck I was able to find strawberry juice at our local Mexican market so that was good. I was just serving this to the family so it wasn't a big deal but I don't think I would be able to serve this to company. I may play around w/ it more some time and see if I can figure out how to hold it together better. Thanks for sharing.:)",

I even tried reducing the liquid and after boiling I received a perfect thickened consistency. However even after omitting the lemon juice and just adding the strawberries the thickened glaze became way too runny. I believe this recipe calls for too many strawberries which could be causing the runny consistency. I could not get a good photo as much of the liquid ran under my pie crust (as well as overflowed in the fridge). The flavor was good (without the lemon juice).
