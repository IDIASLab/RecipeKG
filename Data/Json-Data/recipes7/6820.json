I diced the beef and browned stovetop in a bit of olive oil - then added the celery (3 stalks), carrots, onion and garlic - sprinkled with the salt and pepper.  Cooked all of that for a bit and the sprinkled it with about 1 heaping tablespoon of flour, the paprika.  Cooked that for a bit and added it to the slow cooker.  De-glazed the pan with the beef broth and added that to the slow cooker.  Add the bay leaf, diced potatoes and butternut squash.  I used a large butternut squash - more than the 3/4 lb called for.   There didn't seem to be enough liquid to cover the potatoes.  I initially started with one 14 oz can - which is more than the recipe called for but not nearly enough broth, so I added another 14 oz can of beef broth.  You need to cover the potatoes with liquid or then will turn black.  Set this to cook on low.  It didn't need more than 5 hours.  The escarole did not get added - I didn't have any and planned to add cabbage or bok choy at the end of the cooking time but I forgot and the troops were hungry.  The butternut squash and beef flavor combination is wonderful.",
