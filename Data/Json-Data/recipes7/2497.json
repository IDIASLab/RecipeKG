It has just enough sweetness to bring out the vanilla flavor, but not too much to overwhelm the tartness of the lemon. Also, I'm not sure if the recipe is intended to use the entire lemon rind and not just the zest(?), as lemon pith is quite bitter. I HIGHLY recommend using Meyer lemons if you can find them. They're sweeter and much more fragrant; plus, they have minimal pith, so you can put the rinds directly into the blender without zesting!",
