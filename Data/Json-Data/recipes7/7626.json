I made half a recipe but thought the orange flavor was just a little too diluted.  I added the juice from another two oranges which brought the right balance between the water and the orange flavor.  I thought this recipe was a little sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar.  I definitely will make again and maybe even try Splenda to reduce the calories.  Nice change from all the lemonade, limeade, ice tea that I drink in summer.  Whatever happened to restaurants serving orangeade???",
