        "description": "As a poor starving college student, this recipe is one of my favorites. It is quick, cheap, and 1-portion size. I actually make about 6 servings of the dry ingredients ahead of time, then add the liquid later. The dry is about 11 tablespoons. A whipping cream or ice cream topping completes this heavenly dessert. Can substitute peanut butter for hazelnut spread, but cut the portion to 1 1/2 tablespoon. You can increase cocoa powder and hazelnut spread to 3 tablespoons each and substitute almond extract for vanilla if desired.",

It tasted more like a brownie then a cake on the 1st round and it rose soo high I thought it was going to explode all over the microwave....trust me I was laughing at it. 2nd cup I made I omitted the salt all together. And it was way way better....still rose over the cup so I put it in a soup mug the 3rd time....yes I made this 4x in one night 3 of my kids and hubby got all excited over it. And loved watching it bake soo quickly in the microwave. TY but won't be making it again with the added salt. Taste way better without it.",
