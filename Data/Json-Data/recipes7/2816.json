The smell of the apples and cinnamon and cloves cooking is out of this world. The orange juice and apple cider add a lot to the pie. Made it at Christmas and again in Feb.

Had a lot of liquid so along with the saltines I stirred in some cornstarch I had dissolved in OJ. That kept the cut pieces from being too runny when we served it at room temperature. I had made a lattice-top. The taste was not orangey as I thought it would be considering the juice and zest and I even added a tbs of grand mariner to the stovetop mixture. The taste of cloves was a bit overpowering for me but my husband really enjoyed it. Would make it again with less cloves and maybe add nutmeg and vanilla.",
