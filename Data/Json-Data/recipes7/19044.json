It is a little juicy as the cabbage adds moisture instead of soaking it up as noodles do but so delicious. I may use a little thicker sause or add a couple eggs to try to thicken it up slightly.

                "reviewBody": "I cannot recommend this recipe.  As another reviewer has pointed out the cabbage produces an enormous amount of liquid and the final product is more stew than lasagna.  Maybe there's strategy to avoid this but I don't plan to experiment.  Also, I have questions about the ingredients and cooking method.  The recipe calls for 24 ounces of cottage cheese.  That an enormous amount.  I used half of that and it was adequate.  On the other hand, one pound is not nearly enough to make sufficient sauce.  I used a 24 oz. can.  I also question the instructions for how to secure the cabbage leaves. \"Immerse the cabbage in  boiling water and carefully break off the leaves.  Cook until the leaves are limp, about 3 min,\"   How long do you immerse the cabbage so the leaves with easily detach? No guidance on this critical point. \nHarry",

I put a lot of cabbage between the layers, (since I love cabbage). I also added an 8oz can of tomato sauce to the meat sauce. It was a bit watery, (from the cabbage), but tasted surprisingly good. I will be making again. Thank you!",
