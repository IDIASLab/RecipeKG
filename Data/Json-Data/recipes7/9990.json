It tasted harsh from the vinegar and mustard and didn't have that silky texture that the traditional recipe has which makes sense since it's butterless. I guess we will just stick to the regular bernaise. Thanks for posting an interesting idea though.",

Prep everything while steak is cooking and then finish while steak is resting. I only had plain Dijon and regular vinegar but did add a generous amount of crushed dried tarragon. Watch very carefully as this comes together quickly when using this over the open flame method; add a little extra water if too thick. This really takes steak to the next level.",
