Everyone always asks for the recipe when I bring it somewhere. I have never had fresh peaches on hand so have always omitted them. In the winter I make it with the cranberries and mandarin oranges as the only fruit. The first time I made it with the almonds but the next time I didn't have any so I substituted pecans and preferred those so that is what I always use now. The nuts make the salad!!

I did use canned peaches and mandarin oranges and 1/2'd the dressing--it's been my experience that most of the dressing recipes on here can easily be halved and still be awesome. I wasn't sure about cooking almonds and sugar without oil but it worked perfectly. Just watch closely once the sugar starts to carmelize. Thanks for the recipe! Very good salad.:o)",
