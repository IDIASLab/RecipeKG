I used kefir cheese in place of the cream cheese. I used fresh strawberries - 2 pints diced adding them to the margarita mix mixture and mashing them. Both toppings were thinner than I wanted with everything running off the crust. The second time I sliced the cookie dough into 1/2 inch rounds and placed them in an 8x11 baking pan. I left out the 1/2 cup milk adding just the kefir cheese to the mixed pudding and 1 cup milk. I added extra cornstarch 1/2 - 1T and stirred in the diced berries after the glaze thickened. I liked the second version better (=",
