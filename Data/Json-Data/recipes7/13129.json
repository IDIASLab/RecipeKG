I put them in the oven to see if I could get them extra roasted but nothing really happened. I left them alone and the next day I proceeded to roast them at 350 for about 10 to 15 minutes. Honestly with tons of watch I finally got them as golden as I could to my taste. Still despite the procedure issue the flavor was excellent. I could not stop eating them so I am glad I was making them for someone else. I also out of curiosity used half white sugar and half brown organic sugar. Will make it again and report on what I did to make the procedure work for me!",

I made 8 batches of this within 2 hours and the only thing I'll say is to make sure to stir it regularly particularly in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Fantastic!",

I finished it off in the oven at 190 C until the peanuts browned and the sugar finally crystallized. Once cooled I broke them apart and they were candied...and quite tasty.

For me there was a point where the syrup lost all its moisture and became crumbly. I just added a few teaspoons of water and cooked a few extra minutes.
