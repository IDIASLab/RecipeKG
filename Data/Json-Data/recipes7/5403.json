That 1/2 tea. really make these pop! Make sure you butter and eggs are at room temperature. Forgot to take them out of the fridge? Just pop them on top of a pre-heating oven for 30 min. \n\nActive dry yeast works just great if you don't have cake yeast. Made this spur of the moment when I just wanted to bake something quick and easy. \nAlso: I will always substitute a light brown sugar for white granulated sugar in regards to dough .

Next time I will double the filling and bake them in round pans instead of on cookie sheets so they don't flatten out too much and all the gooey yumminess stays in the pan.  I drizzled a glaze of orange juice and powdered sugar over the top.  Delicious.  My daughter had fun using a thread to cut the rolls.  These are definitely going to be one of our house specialties.
