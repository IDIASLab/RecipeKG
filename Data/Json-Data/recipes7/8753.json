I did not think it was too eggy.  Thought it was very similar to a mini version of German Oven Pancake. I opted not to do the cinnamon sugar topping but will try next time. I also, by accident, baked it at 375 the whole time which I think helped it not be as runny as others had mentioned.  Turned out beautifully and tasted yummy!  I'm keeping it in my recipe file. :)",

They are not the prettiest popovers I've ever had, they're definitely eggy, but they are tasty and very easy to make.",

I understand that with three eggs they're going to be eggy but I just felt like they could use a little more sweetness in them. I used some melted butter and the remaining cinnamon sugar mixture and poured that over the top of them once I plated them and that did make them pretty sweet. For next time I thought about using two eggs and then putting some vanilla flavored coffee creamer and a few spices incorporated into the batter like nutmeg and cinnamon sugar and instead of using white sugar maybe brown sugar. I'm not sure. I'm not saying this is a bad recipe at all because it's not I just would prefer a little less egg texture and a little more sweetness. With some tinkering around I think this could be wonderful.",

These didn't look like a hot air balloon but they did \"pop \" but immediately deflated. I'm blaming the blueberries. No biggie. Anyone who hadn't had popovers before wouldn't know & they're still good. This made twelve regular size muffin-tin size. Huh?:D I divided the 3T butter among the 12 & they weren't totally stick-free but close.:)",
