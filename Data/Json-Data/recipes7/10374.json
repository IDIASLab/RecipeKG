The muffins came out even more amazing when baked! I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips, but made no other changes. These muffins are supposed to be for tomorrow's breakfast\u2026. they might not make it. ;)",

Nuts, coconut flake, chopped dates all work well, and every time it bakes up like cupcakes but faster, moist and fudgey. With white whole wheat and coconut sugar it's more....dark chocolate, less peanut butter cup, but just as good. Best batch got hand made almond butter (with skins still on) and chopped hazelnuts. Since I'm mostly cooking for one, I only make a half batch at a time to make it harder to pig out.",
