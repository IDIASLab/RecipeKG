And then I used soaked dates instead of honey (because of the potential botulism risk with honey and little ones). Still came out tasty and we'll add this smoothie to our morning breakfast routine! I particularly like this one for toddlers because of the high quantity of healthy fats -- which are so important for developing brains -- and the high protein content from the greek yogurt. Yet it still appealed to her taste buds...Thanks!!!",
