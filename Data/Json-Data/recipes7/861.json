My husband recently went to costco and came back with 5 pounds of strawberries and I didn't know what to do with them so I went in search of a recipe.  When I found this recipe, I was a bit skeptical...I mean really vinegar marinated strawberries...Well, I made them and they were delicious.  It is now my husbands favorite strawberry recipe; he has requested and I have made it several times since the first batch.  With all this strawberry it did take us several days to eat it, but I found that the longer it sat in the marinade the better it tasted.  So now I marinade it for 2-3 days.  Serve with ice cream, eat alone or just top your favorite anything really.  YUMMY!!!",
