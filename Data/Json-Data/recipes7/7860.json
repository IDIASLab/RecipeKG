I used a deep dish pie plate and it took about 6-1/2 minutes for the center to set up. The only negative is that it is pretty egg-y and the outside of the dutch baby was a little chewy/rubbery but that's not a major issue. Definitely will make this again trying other fresh fruits. We're heading toward peak strawberry season in Florida so I'm pretty sure a strawberry dutch baby will be on the menu soon. I'm for anything quick on a weekday morning so thanks Sally Anne for giving me a new recipe.",

It also took ten minutes to cook. And we all know what happens when egg gets cooked that long. We decided to substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream. If we make it again, (which we probably won't!) we won't put as much egg in, will put a lot more yogurt and flour in, and ADD BUTTER!!!! We were, like, so disappointed. My sister didn't even eat hers. Next time, we probably will make the usual delicious oven Dutch baby.",
