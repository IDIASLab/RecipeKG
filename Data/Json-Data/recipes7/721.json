I was worried about not having enough liquid for these muffins because I've baked with whole wheat flour and it tends to soak up more liquid than AP flour. I did add one large mashed banana to help with that. Even with the additional banana, these did turn out a little dry. It could be that my lemon was a on the small side, you never really know. I would like to make these again and either add an additional egg or maybe a quarter cup so more of milk. As is, it's a good muffin recipe.",
