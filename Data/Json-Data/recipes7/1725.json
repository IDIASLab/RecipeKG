I dried them in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees and then added the sugar and cinnamon and turned them every 10 minutes because of the moisture in the soaked seeds. They were nice and crunchy with a sweet and salty taste. I started eating them and couldn't stop. YUMMY!",

I think they would have been fine without the last one or two coatings. I did not have parchment paper and just used a lightly greased cookie sheet and it seemed to work out okay.",

Everything was going great until the last addition of the remaining 2 TBS of sugar and the last 10 min in the oven. The final bake resulted in the sugar burning a little quickly melting and spreading out and making more of a \"brittle\" out of the seeds. As \"christalmiron\" mentioned they had to be individually broken apart and the excess \"brittle\" broken off each seed. The pumpkin is lost a little under all the sugar and cinnamon but the coating flavor is very good. We enjoyed trying a new recipe and I will try again and watch them very closely toward the end.

I followed the recipe to the letter except I think I used about 2.5 TBS of butter since that is what I had left of one stick. I had no issues with it turning into brittle at the end. as soon as I pulled it out of the oven I stirred it and tapped any clumps with the edge of my spoon so maybe that was the trick. Oh and per one suggestion I dumped the seeds back into the bowl I used to coat them with butter and Cin/Suger the first time and stirred them in that after each baking cycle so again maybe that help my seeds to stay separate.",
