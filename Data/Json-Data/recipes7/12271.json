It's a great recipe that even my daughter loves! Now this cake makes its way onto my table every Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loves it.

Everyone loved it even the little ones that swore they would never eat pumpkin in any way! Took half of it to the office and sprinkled it with powdered sugar everyone was asking me to make them some. It truly is delicious and easy to make. I used pumpkin cooked in cinnamon like it is suggested. I tried it with canned pumpkin but it just doesn't taste the same. Its better with fresh pumpkin and if its baked it takes out a lot of the moisture it takes from boiling it. I like to boil mine with cinnamon either way I just let it sit in a strainer and come back to it every now and then to stir and pat dry with a paper towel any excess water that comes out of it. I have made it several times already and it gets rave reviews everywhere I take it! Love it!",

I used canned pumpkin and I think the batter might have been a little too thick so perhaps I should have used 1/2 cup oil. It still came out great and was easy to throw together for a last minute dessert. thanks for the recipe",
