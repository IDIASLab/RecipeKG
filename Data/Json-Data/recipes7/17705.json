I scaled this down to two servings and made this for lunch today, but I think a cup of this would be an elegant starter for a fancy company (or family) dinner.  The caramelized onions were so incredibly sweet that I\u2019ll probably reduce the amount of sugar in the future (could be personal taste preference).  The combination of caramelized onions and the brussels sprouts share equally in producing a complex, but balanced flavor profile.   A crumbled bacon garnish might be nice on this soup. I really think even brussels sprouts haters would enjoy this (just don't tell them what they're eating).  carenough2, thanks for sharing your recipe, this one\u2019s a keeper.",

I made my own homemade bone broth by simmering two rotisserie chickens that I had deboned for about 14hrs, then seasoning the broth with salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, and garlic powder. Then I strained out the bones and added back in the breast meat from one of the chickens and simmered that for two hours before adding the other ingredients. I added fresh garlic to the sauteed onions. I also whisked two egg yolks and some heavy cream into the finished soup. The eggs are a perfect flavor addition with this recipe and they make the broth silky and creamy. I will definitely make this recipe again and again! It is heavenly and so easy to make! You don't have to make the homemade bone broth, store bought broth is also good. I do it to use up the chicken carcasses and for the extra nutrients. And because it tastes so darn good!",
