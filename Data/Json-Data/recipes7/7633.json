Looking for a faceless recipe for the \u2018February 2013 Faceless Frenzy\u2019 I found that I had this saved in my recipe box.  I also had the personal version before it became published.  I mixed the dressing up in the morning so the flavors could blend all day.  I poured the dressing on about an hour before serving, and it is delicious.  I used a blend of half cabbage and half broccoli slaw.  The dressing is so good that my family commented that they would like it as a salad dressing.  I liked that the leftovers didn\u2019t get soggy and were great packed in lunches the next day.  Elle, I\u2019m thrilled to be the first to review and photograph your recipe.  It most definitely will be made in this house, again and again.  :o)",
