Usually I cook the sliced onions until they are translucent in just a tiny bit of butter and then add a tablespoon of sugar and balmic vinegar. While that is cooking I will dip the chicken in the egg and then dredge in flour. Next salt and pepper the chicken and brown on each side in a tiny bit of olive oil. In a casserole dish I will lay the chicken Brie and top off with onions and bake all of that. While that is in the oven I will make the sauce. I have never had any problems with the sauce... and I think it adds a lot to the meal.",
