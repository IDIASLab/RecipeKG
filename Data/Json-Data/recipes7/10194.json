I was unable to beat it smooth as the recipe suggests. It ended up being just a crumbly mass. I hoped it would melt and smooth out during baking, but it did not. In retrospect, I should have added a tablespoon of water to help it out, but even if I had the flavor would have been a bit lacking. A peanut butter and sugar only recipe will always be either dry or claggy, depending on the proportions. Next time I make the pie, I'll seek out a recipe that uses a more complex filling (using eggs or perhaps cream cheese) but I will retain the meringue recipe.",
