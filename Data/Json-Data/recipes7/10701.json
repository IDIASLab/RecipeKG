I agree with some of the reviews also it's a very cheesy sauce (which we like) and will surprise you- it's more filling than you think. We also would have liked a little more ham in it. So to the changes made- I basically was cleaning out the refrigerator: I didn t have enough shredded cheddar so combined parmesan and loved it. Used up some leftover broccoli from dinner a few nights before but not enough (and didn t have cauliflower) so used frozen peas and corn). I already had regular cream cheese and felt the green onions did fine for flavor so didn t worry about the chive and onion part. I didn t have a packaged pie crust but DID have a thin crust pizza dough so used that. Not quite the flakiness you d want but worked in a pinch. Here s the kicker I didn t read it correctly thought the crust went on bottom AND top! So I rolled it out put the bottom and side crust and couldn t figure out how you d get a full top crust (but I wasn t planning to do that anyway). I had leftover mashed potatoes that I used for the top instead of a crust kind of like a Shepard s pie. It turned out great though and I used up a lot of leftovers!",
