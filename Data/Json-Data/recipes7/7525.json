The blend of almond and nutmeg didn't appeal to me, so I just stuck with boring old vanilla - and added about 1-1/2 cups of frozen blueberries. What peaked my curiosity, really, was the lesser amount of sugar than the standard recipe calls for.  Since sugar has a lot more to do with a baked product than just its sweetness (like volume and moistness, for example) I was interested to see how it might affect the final result.  Well, apparently reducing the sugar by this half cup was not enough to affect its quality in any way.  It was delicious.",

This is at the top of my cake recipes from here on in!\n\nDon't have cake flour in the pantry?  No problem.  For every 1 cup of all purpose flour, remove two tablespoons of flour and replace with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  So for this recipe, I measured 3 cups all purpose flour, removed six tablespoons of flour and replaced with six tablespoons cornstarch.  Sifted together and presto, cake flour!",

I drizzled straberry glaze over the top and scattered fresh sliced strawberries on top of that and then sprinkled it with confectioners sugar. It was delicious. Unfortunately this is not the recipe I was looking for but it was a great substitute. A woman i used to know made an angel food cake that had cream cheese in the recipe and it was heavenly. I cannot find anything like it and i am not able to get it from her anymore. Anyway, this was agreat cake. Thanks for making me look good with the family. a couple people swore i had to have bought it cause normal people don't bake like that from scratch. Box mixes has ruined the world of baking in my opinion.",

Covered the blueberries with the remaining batter and baked for 60 minutes - not done. It needed the full 80 minutes. 18 year old started cutting it before I could photograph it (really pretty) and took one bite closed his eyes and said; \"BOMB!\" THAT FOLKS - IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!

I made the following changes: (1) added one tablespoon of lemon juice (2) zested half of a small lemon into the mix (3) only put 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract (4) used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and next time i would probably omit both since i didn't notice a difference. almond extract is extremely strong and i just didn't want to overpower the cake. turns out the 1/4 teaspoon was enough for us. next time i might only bake it for 70 minutes though because the edges were a little brown at 80; cake was still moist though. i topped this with a basic vanilla glaze but next time i think i will just make a fresh whipped cream to top it. and there WILL be a next time. i'm so happy i tried this even though there aren't 2 000 reviews for it=) it's great!",
