I also did what other recipes recommended and blended everything except the oil first and then slowly poured the oil in as the blender was running. I first poured in about a quarter of the oil, not wanting to waste it if this was not going to work and kept running the blender. At first it did seem like an oily mess but I kept going for another couple of minutes and suddenly it started getting thicker. Sort of like whipping cream - just when you want to give up, it gets thick. And then I poured the rest of the oil in slowly making sure that it became incorporated into the cream before adding more. The result is thick, creamy and yummy. I am impressed. So, don't give up, this is a good recipe. Next time I'll try it without the egg white.",

She also used a hand mixer and drizzled in the oil. I thought hers was the best but this is much better. I used 1/2 corn oil and 1/2 olive oil.  The stick blender is much quicker and there is no splatter.  You are absolutely right there is nothing better than a slice of bread with a big slather of home-made mayo. Try this recipe.
