I don't use microwaves so I melted this in my double boiler over a low simmer. I didn't like the idea of mixing plain water into my melted chocolate so I dissolved the coffee granules in the water then whisked it into the chocolate. These set up well and tasted great.",

Have to be very careful when melting  white choc.  because it seizes. Shared the recipe with five other people.  The whole recipe makes about 70 pieces. I think any kind of chips can be used to coat the candy and next time would like to try butterscotch or peanut butter chips.  One word to describe them....YUM!",
