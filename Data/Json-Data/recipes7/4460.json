I did have to add more flour for a thicker consistency and I did not ball them in my hand. I used a melon baller scooped them into boiling water then stretched them after they were cooked as I did a coating of coconut. I would also modify and use 1/4 tsp salt rather than 1 tsp. It was too salty for my taste. After modifying the recipe they were great though! Reminds me of the treats mama would buy for me in the fish market when I was growing up:)",
