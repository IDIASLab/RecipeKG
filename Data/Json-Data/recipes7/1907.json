Spunky Buddy's: First of all I put these in identical miniature martini glasses using one-third of what was called for which I believe made for a much more interesting presentation and fun in sharing. The kissing part was a lot of fun but I fail to see how it enhanced the flavor experience. I found that in small amounts these were tasty cordials. Now Naples34102 (Mrs. Spunky Buddy): I actually liked these a lot more than I thought I would but I have to say there is no way I could have drank the full amount of either as both are rich and sweet more of a cordial or after-dinner drink than a cocktail in my view. I thought I would much prefer the His version with the vodka and Frangelico but found it decidedly sweeter than I thought it would be. The Hers version on the other hand which I thought would be too girly for my tastes was surprisingly delicious. We used whipped cream vodka as that s what we have here in Naples and the combination of that with the raspberry vodka cr\u00e8me de cacao chocolate syrup and half and half made this like a drinkable dessert but oddly without being too sweet. Anthony you have come up with a couple of winners that Spunky Buddy can make for us any time. Good job!",
