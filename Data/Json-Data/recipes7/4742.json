Also I recommend taking the time to make your own sauce rather than using a jar. The sauce was wonderful and really made the dish.",

I am a full time working mom with two young kids so I did the speedy version. I did not make my own sauce I used Newman's Own Sockaroni sauce. I microwaved the butternut squash whole and then peeled and sliced it into thin slices once it cooled. Next time I will buy frozen spinach and thaw it to speed things up even more. Also I did not use all of the cheese mixture the lasagna was plenty big without using all of it and I figured it would cut down on the calories as well. Still turned out wonderfully and I love that this is a much healthier version of traditional lasagna. Thank you for sharing!",

The sauce turned out a little thick for me but this may have been because I used fresh tomatoes; I will just add more water next time. I crushed the butternut squash and this helped it to not be so chunky. I loved the sweetness of the squash but my hubby and kids did not so I would probably leave it out next time. Otherwise it was wonderful wholesome and delicious! It is lots of layers so make sure you have a deep dish to cook this one! Thanks for a great keeper!!",

                "reviewBody": "This a really good lasagna- And the first time I made one myself! I would omit the zucchini next time. Many said this was somewhat bland or needed more seasoning so I seasoned to taste. The sauce I used a few more cloves of garlic increased the spices (added marjoram thyme chili flakes bay leaf & rosemary) used ground pork (worked well enough since it's a white meat- I would drain off the fat a little more next time though) and since the recipe called for 7.5 cups of liquid total I divided it as such: 1 can diced spicy tomatoes (with onions & seasoning) 1 cup tomato gravy (made with fresh tomatoes & bacon grease- had leftover from another recipe/meal) 1 cup spicy tomato sauce 2 cups tomato paste & 2 cups water beef bouillon cube. I forgot to mention that along with the meat portion I had added the remains of a pack of cremini mushrooms. I only cooked it for roughly 45 minutes as the sauce had reached a consistency that I liked. I opted to boil my butternut squash after peeling and dicing for roughly half an hour then mashed with a little butter and seasoned with sage salt garlic powder & pepper. Instead of simply wilted the spinach we opted to crisp them a bit and used 2 bags of fresh spinach. Opted for low-fat cottage cheese instead if ricotta and used low-fat mozzarella. Baked as directed but you need deeper than a 9x13 and there will be leftover sauce (little bit). I seasoned the mixture with S&P. We served it with \"Herb Spread for French Bread\" from AR.",

I cooked onions and garlic in a little evoo then added the turkey drained a little added the sauce. Then made the ricotta layer and sliced the veggies. Also used frozen spinach well drained. And I used whole milk ricotta which made it better. Next time I'd use a peeler to get thin slices of zucchini and season each layer (add s&P and maybe something else). I also mashed the squash which worked nicely. I used regular lasagna noodles and didn't add any water. It was pretty dry but I like it that way. Will be making this again!!!",
