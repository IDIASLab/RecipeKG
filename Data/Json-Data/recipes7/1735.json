Luckily I found Quark vanilla sugar and non-instant vanilla pudding at a local German deli (Old Heidelberg if you are in the Phoenix area). I followed the recipe to the T except I added \"drunk raisins\" (raisins soaked in rum) to the batter as my Oma does. It was fantastic. I am so glad that I can now make the cheesecake that I previously only had on trips to Germany. Thank you!",

I'm not sure why anyone would sub cottage cheese for quark since it's not even close to it in texture or taste. It has the texture of ricotta and the taste of a light sour cream. You must use quark for this recipe to taste right. To get the nice color on top I had to cook it for an hour and twenty minutes and chilled it over night. Again great recipe!",

Well the spirit moved me and I decided to go for it on my own. I followed this recipe to the letter and I give it 5 stars easily. The flavor is fantastic the texture is moist the lemon taste s faint yet gives it the little tart taste you expect without having to grate a lemon peel into the batter. Like others have mentioned here however 60 minutes was definitely not enough at 350 degrees not at all. Mine took a good 80-90 minutes to firm up before I pulled it out. other than adjusting the cook time this recipe is perfect. I will definitely be making this again and again.",
