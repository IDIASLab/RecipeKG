This is a classic banana bar recipe, but its distinction is with the browned butter frosting which I thought was a nice complement.  Great taste, lovely frosting, but I prefer mixing up the batter using the traditional creaming method - cream the sugar and butter well, add the eggs and vanilla, and finally the bananas. Add the flour mixture alternately in thirds with the sour cream beginning and ending with the flour.  A second helping for Hubs after supper?  I'd call these a hit!",

I like that these are actually \"bars\" that you can cut and eat out of hand, unlike other \"banana bar\" recipes here that are more like cake and require a fork and plate. The frosting is incredible...don't leave it out!! I cooked the butter for exactly 3 minutes on medium heat and it was perfectly browned. Our new official banana dessert here. Thank you:)",

My bananas were completely black which gave theses bars a very good banana flavor with just the right sweetness. We like nuts so I doubled the amount called for in the batter and also chopped some to top the frosting. These bars are very moist and delicious. I will definitely make these again. Thanks Allie.",
