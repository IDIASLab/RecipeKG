They resemble a gingersnap but are not as crisp and they have a very original flavor to them that is just like chai! The only thing i changed was not squashing the cookies with fork tongs as they looked prettier spreading out themselves and i baked them 15 minutes. You MUST try these cookies and the chai tea mix in this recipe!",

I highly recommend making the chai tea mix - it's a lot more economical than buying the packets. I used an 1/8 cup measure to get walnut size and ended up with 35 cookies.",
