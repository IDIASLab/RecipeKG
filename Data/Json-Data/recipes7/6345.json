I found out what she made was actually a Walnut Poteca when I discovered the recipe on here. I pared back the recipe to make a small amount since I had never done it before & it was a test. I still had a large amount of nut filling. It immediately reminded me of German Chocolate icing which I looked up on Allrecipes & the only thing I had to do was add butter & cook to thicken my filling. It turned out very well esp. Since I was using left overs. I would add some vanilla or coconut extract next time but good recipe.",
