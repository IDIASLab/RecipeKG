I usually find it annoying when someone rates something 5 stars but it's been completely altered from the original but here I am doing it! I came here looking for a grapefruit sorbet recipe and found this one but I was concerned about the \"ice cube effect\" you get when you freeze sorbet. I Found another recipe with the addition of Vodka which I know hinders rock hard freezing so I combined the two. I used 3 cups of pink grapefruit juice and 1 cup of Simple Syrup made of Splenda Blend for Baking (50% sugar 50% splenda) and 3 tablespoons of Vodka. That's it. I added it to the canister of my gel ice cream maker and churned for about 30 minutes. It was very soft and liquidy but froze nicely and was delicious. We added the rest to a container and put it in the freezer. The next day I pulled it out and was surprised to see that it had NOT frozen rock hard. It was now 24 hours later the perfect consistency for sorbet and sherbert. I've now made it several times each being sure to add 3 tablespoons of Vodka which I'm convinced is helping with the freezing consistency (because Vodka doesn't freeze).",
