I followed the directions almost exactly with the exception of substituting Morningstar Farms soy crumbles for the beef and I omitted the beef bouillon to make the chili vegetarian friendly. It was so easy to make and was low maintenance once it was simmering on the stove. The potatoes added such a nice texture and flavor to it and the pinch of nutmeg sugar added just enough complexity to it without making it fall into a Cincinnati category of sweetness. I served it with shredded cheddar cheese and multi-seed flatbread crackers. It will become a staple recipe in my household!",
