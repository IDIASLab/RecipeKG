Easy to make had to beat my husband away from the bacon while it was cooling. I used Rolling Rock beer and as I didn't have butter I just used bacon grease and left out the salt. They turned out a bit sweet but that's not surprising (and is expected) considering the bacon is candied. I thought the taste of the beer was a bit prominent but my husband said he couldn't really taste it. Some of the pancakes came out underdone even though they seemed perfectly cooked (that could also be attributed to my stove it's been acting up lately). They're also pretty heavy. Overall they tasted pretty good but could use some tweaking. If you don't like sweeter pancakes use regular bacon and don't candy it. I'll probably try this recipe again but fiddle with it a little.",

The beer was detectable but not overwhelming and gave the pancakes a fabulous aroma...the burned sugar drippings in the oven not so much...will make again for a special morning (or dinner as it were).
