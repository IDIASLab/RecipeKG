Place the spring form pan on a sheet pan - there will be a little leakage.   I had to bake mine for an additional 20 minutes - cover the top with a loose piece of foil to prevent over browning.   Next time I would toss the cranberries with a little of the flour as well as the sugar, to keep them from sinking.   Awesome recipe.   Thanks!",

I also chopped up frozen cranberries because that's what I had on hand and they dropped to the bottom. I later read dusting them in flour may prevent that. If anyone has any additional suggestions that would be great. Overall it was delicious and I'm glad I cut in half because I think I might have eaten more than half of it one sliver at time over two days:)",
