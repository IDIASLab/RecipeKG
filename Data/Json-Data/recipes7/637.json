Maybe my taste buds work differently than others as I found Nonei's recipe to be bland. Cloves were strong smelling in the zip-bag but didn't add much taste to the cooked 'cereal'. Ended up adding 1 Tbsp white sugar - something was still missing but didn't know what so left well enough alone. Printed recipe 4/6/09 and made 1/10/10. Didn't see 2 reviewers comments until I came on to put my '2 cents worth' in. If I make recipe again I will cook rice same morning as I fix the \"cereal\". Rice was fluffy when cooked the night before. Refrigerating rice caused rice to be hard; it did not soften in hot milk. Instead of using microwave to heat milk and rice I heated mixture in my double-boil pan - use it in making other hot cereals and it works great. Thanks for the opportunity of making this recipe.",

I should have known better-- mine spilled over the sides at a little over 4 minutes. Next time I'll stop and stir halfway through.",

If I left milk ccoking in there unsupervised I would have a huge stinky boiled over mess in way less than 5 minutes!

My husband's mother used to make this for him when he was little with left over rice from the night before and it was wonderful to do it again. I really like the idea of nutmeg and was sad we didn't have any but it still was really good. Little changes I made were: did half white sugar and half brown sugar. And while I don't think it needs it my husband's family adds about a T of butter while I like adding a handful of raisins. YUMMY!!:) Thanks again!",
