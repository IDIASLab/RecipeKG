For those that like the 'taste' of bacon grease as another reviewer said try this: after mixing the sugar vinegar and oil together pour it into the skillet and stir. This will help the sugar melt quickly and also 'pick up' the flavor of the bacon. Remove from heat and cool slightly. pour over the veggie mix and toss. Add crumbled bacon. This is equally good served at room temperature.",

I have done this dish 2 times in the past month as my garden okra is really coming in now. I have 2 other things: First I cut the sugar down to 1/4 the second time and it was much better. The first time I used the full 1/3 cup and it was too sweet. Just for new users even though okra is cooked until tender once marinated with other ingredients it becomes a bit slimmy so you may want to make sure boiled okra is a favorite. I love it great recipe.",
