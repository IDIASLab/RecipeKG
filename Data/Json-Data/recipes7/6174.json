I never realized how easy it is to form a Star of David! This dough was relatively easy to work with but I think it needs a little more yeast perhaps an extra 1/2 teaspoon as the dough didn't rise as well as I thought it should and the bread was a little heavy. That didn't stop us from devouring the entire thing as soon as it was cool enough to eat though! Thanks for an awesome new way to shape Challah bread.",

The eggnog flavor was almost too subtle; I think I should've added either 1 ounce rum or 1/2 tsp rum extract too. I mixed everything in my stand mixer for about 8 minutes then added 2 Tbsp room temp butter for richness and mixed for another 2 minutes. I gave it a first rise then punched it down and shaped it as directed. Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with pearl sugar. Fun recipe!",
