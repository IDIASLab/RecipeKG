The cheesecake part came to the very top of a 9\" springform pan even after post-bake deflation. I made the fruit topping very thick and was able to pile it actually above the top of the pan. Alas after that I couldn't make the final creamy pudding layer because it would have just ended up on the counter.  Moral of the story I made it exactly as stated but highly advise using a 10\" springform so everything fits!",
