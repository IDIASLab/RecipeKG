Because the berries vary in sweetness as well as personal preferences vary, I suggest only adding half the sugar in the beginning. After 4-5 minutes, taste for sweetness. If more sugar is needed add a tablespoon at a time until satisfied.\n2. Add a small pinch of salt.\n3. Refrain from adding water until the raspberries release their juices, then add a tablespoon of water until the desired consistency is reached.\n4. This sauce would be fantastic in savory dishes. Just reduce the amount of sugar. Perhaps add herbs and spices to make it even more special.",
