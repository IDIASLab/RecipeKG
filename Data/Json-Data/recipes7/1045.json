I love the fact that I don't have to cut up any hot peppers. I can also easily adjust the heat of each batch. I make 2 to 3 batches a year as this is an expected gift for most family and friends. I also have a local caterer who buys several jars and uses them on crackers with cream cheese piped around the outside. Very festive. We also use a milder version as dip for chicken fingers and pork. Thank you for submitting this recipe. I was sick of wearing gloves and cutting hot peppers up!",

I used lemon zest instead of chile flakes and I added a half cup of sugar more to combat the pungency of the vinegar. Too bad it was already too late. The jelly is not bad but not as great as I have had in the past. Still on the lookout for the perfect bell pepper recipe! I think the lemon juice will do it though.",
