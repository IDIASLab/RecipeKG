Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth I would probably reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar on top to about 1 tablespoon and use a little less jelly next time. Amazingly enough the white pepper really did set off the sweetness of the fruit without being easily identifiable as pepper. Mine turned out a tad bit too soupy but I wouldn't fault the recipe for that. The fruit I used was at peak season and fairly juicy so next time I'll compensate with a bit more cornstarch. Aside from the time it took to slice the fruit this was quick to put together and bake.",
