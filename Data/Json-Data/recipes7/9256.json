The olive oil I used was lemon olive oil and I used leftover beer butt chicken rather than grilled. I toasted the pine nuts (put them in a pan on stovetop in low heat until barely browned). We thought this was delicious. The only thing I would worry about would be that there wasn't enough of that wonderful dressing. I'm not sure because I made such a small batch and we didn't even eat all of that but I would want a little more dressing than it called for so maybe a recipe and a half of that? It'd be good on any other salad so that would work for me! Thanks for a great salad EMILIEWASMYEVE!",
