It was absolutely great and I've been looking for a really good bbq meat flavor for a long time. Accidentally left them in the fridge for two days so rinsed them off before cooking the rib tips for 2 hrs at 250 in my toaster oven tightly wrapped in foil. The only way it could have been better I'm sure is if I had SMOKED paprika as the recipe asks. I added some Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar bbq sauce at the last minute and that just enhanced the flavor but the rib tips were absolutely great with just the rub.",

The only minor change i made was that I only used a half tablespoon of the cayenne pepper because I was concerned it might be a bit too spicy. I think next time I will go ahead and use the entire amount because it wasn't overwhelming. I also followed the poster's suggestion of smoking then wrapping the ribs in foil with butter and honey and was extremely impressed by how good they were. Great recipe; loved it!!

Find a recipe with a bit more salt and a little less sugar is what I m finding out. Maybe it turned out like this because I used an electric smoker and just put it on the rack. I just couldn t give up that smoke flavor to do it like it said on here and I m more of a dry rib guy.",
