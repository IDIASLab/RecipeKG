This salad is delicious in flavor and packed with protein. I changed some of the ingredients to reflect a better flavor. Very simple, very French. This makes enough salad for 4 people.",

I truly can't tell you how good it was.... That being said I use this recipe and tweak slighty... I mix the onion (one small white or yellow) garlic sugar oil vinegar mustard herbes salt and pepper all in my Ninja until smooth... then I let it sit for a day un-refrigerated before I use it... Instead of bacon I use Kielbasa cooked in beer... they use meat from the cheek for bacon in France... so ours tastes different... the kielbasa is closer.... Then instead of a poached egg... I fry sunny side up really runny two eggs per salad... if you do this you will be as close as I can to replicate what I ate in France.... Enjoy....",

I had never poached an egg before and i didn't know how much vinegar to add to the water and it doesn't specify in the ingredients so I just poured some in. It sort of worked. It really made enough to feed 8 and I have a LOT of dressing left over. If I did it again I would cut the dressing in half. But very delicious! Thanks. I'll make it again.",

I wasn't up for raw garlic today so I sauteed it in a little bacon grease. My first time poaching eggs and it was fun! My first one came out too overdone...the yolks were almost cooked all the way through but my second was perfect! I sliced the onion instead of small dice too. The creaminess from the yolk gives this salad and AMAZING flavor! Thank you so much!!",

We don't like endive so I simply used more lettuce (mixed spring greens to be exact) and left out the garlic because it was forgotten. Also added red onion as many reviewers recommended. For the dressing we cut back on the evoo and (balsamic) vinegar while reducing the other components to as necessary. I make my own blend of H-D-P and perhaps it is stronger than store-bought but it was quite over-powering and I would definitely use even less than I did the next time. This would pair well with a rich meatless soup like French onion soup.",
