It is a great way to use up leftover eggwhites after making custard:-)They go deliciously crunchy with just a touch of cinnamon flavour. I usually whisk all ingredients except the nuts together in a large bowl then add the nuts last and mix the coating through. Highly recommended would make a great gift i haven't actually given any away yet coz i'm too selfish i want to keep them all for myself.",
