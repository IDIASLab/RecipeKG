In the future I will cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup in the blueberry layer just too sweet for us but that could be taste preference. Grunts are easy to make blueberries are in abundance right now and this is a nice way to use them. Passion to cook we enjoyed your dessert.",

Instead add just the sugar and 1 tbsp of lemon juice then wait 5 min before heating. The sugar will draw the juice out of the berries no water needed. Also you can reduce the sugar by up to half if you like. 2) The dough recipe is just perfect but doesn't make enough. Double the dough recipe. Also the milk should read UP TO 1/2 cup milk. The dough should have to be spooned into the berries it should not pour. When I used all the milk the dough came out too runny.",
