I have had that happen on other recipes and was so happy to see it did not happen again with this recipe! The changes I made were to use brown sugar and omit the corn syrup and honey in the topping opting for water instead. This made the sugar dissolve into a smooth consistency. The buns were light and flaky and large in size. Just like from the bakery. I will absolutely be making these again!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent. Based on prior reviews I made 1 1/2 times the topping. I also used a slightly smaller pan arrangement: one 9x15 one 9x9. I cut the slices about 1\" thick. They came out a bit higher than the picture shows and I was happy they did. I also let them rest in a warm oven for the 20 minutes suggested. I flipped one pan immediately but let the other cool off for 5 min first. The cooler pan flipped better and the topping remained glazed instead of running down into the buns. The taste is excellent. I just made this the 3rd time. I retract the comment about using 1.5 times as much topping. The buns came out flatter than I liked so I suggest going to two 8x8 pans and cutting the rolls 1-1.5 inches thick. Note to self: 1. make sure to cook the topping well 2. use less butter.",
