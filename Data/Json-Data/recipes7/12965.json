It's easy to make, and super healthy! You don't have to feel guilty about eating 2 servings. :)  I made it exactly as written (with the exception of only using 1tsp of sugar instead of 1tbsp) and ended up cooking mine for about 20-25 mins, but this will depend on how big or small you cut your veggies.  For the 9 tbsp of lemon juice, I ended up  using 3.5 lemons.   NOTE: I noticed when the first review (2 star) was left, the recipe also had an error in it, asking for only 1 1/4 cups of water. Yes, this would cause the soup to be way too lemony. (I emailed allrecipes about the error). I made it the correct way using 6 1/3 cups of water (per submitter's personal recipe) and the flavors are very well-balanced, with a nice lemony tang. Perfect! Thank you Linda for sharing your recipe!",
