Now that they are canned and cooling on the counter I am prepping for the next batch to which I plan to add some hot peppers for a little zest. Not only did your recipe eliminate the bitterness the pickles are yummy! I am a little bummed because all my jars sealed so I won't be putting a dud in the fridge to snack on. I need more jars:)",

These pickles have been enjoyed by my family for well over 100 yrs.  From what I understand the term \"icicle\" refers to the shape - we cut ours lengthwise. And the blue-green color is because historically they were made in copper pots which reacted with the chemicals and turned them this hue. So happy to see your recipe and get the confirmation I needed on measurments.  Thanks for sharing!",
