                "reviewBody": "9.7.17 Using pears that were slightly underripe as suggested resulted in muffins without a whole lot of flavor. The sweetness of a pear doesn t peak until it ripens and the riper the pear the sweeter. Also this is simply too many pears. When I looked at my bowl of pears & nuts in comparison to the muffin batter the pear bowl was fuller. What ends up happening with this much fruit inside is that the muffins start turning very brown on the outside but the liquid from the pears makes the inside very soft not firm enough to eat with just your hands. And I cooked the muffins for an extra 5 minutes too. Glad that at least the muffins had walnuts and cinnamon because that made them just OK. TerryWilson sorry to be so critical as a first reviewer and I would not discourage others from trying this recipe but I was hoping for more flavor and a better muffin texture.",
