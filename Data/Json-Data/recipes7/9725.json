Looks beautiful in a trifle bowl. Great as a birthday or holiday dessert. Depending on how many people you are serving it usually does not last more than 1 day in my house! This can also be easily modified with other fresh fruits, but strawberry is our favorite! Pound cake cake work in place of angel food. Enjoy!",
