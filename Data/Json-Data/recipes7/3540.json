Next time I will only use 2 limes plus add 2 more lemons. Instead of juicing all of the fruit I sliced them in 1/4\" - 1/2\" slices and removed the seed pieces. I placed the sliced fruit in a bowl and added the sugar. I mashed slightly with a potato masher and let sit for 1 hour before adding the water and ice. This makes for a nicer presentation.",

Instead of just sugar I made a simple syrup by melting a cup of sugar and a cup of water together. Then I adjusted the fruit to 4 lemons 3 limes and 2 large navel oranges. Once the syrup was added to the juice I added additional cups of water (about 4 total) until I got the balance of tart to sweet that the family liked. I made this several times over the weekend of the 4th!!",

I think the refreshing factor works best when you need to be refreshed. 2) Adjust amounts to suit your tastes. I used 5 limes 5 lemons 3 oranges (because they were so large) and approximately 1 1/2 c. sugar. (It needed more sugar though.) I also used only 4 c. water. 3) Use seedless fruit if possible. That way you don't have to fish the seeds out of your juice!:)",
