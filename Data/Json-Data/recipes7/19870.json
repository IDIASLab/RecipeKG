Yes, we're going a little nutty but I've pretty much always just picked a few and then moved on with this little fruit but now I love it, and I'm determined to keep going with as many recepies as we can find.",

But I had the inkling that loquats would make the perfect tart crumble, and this recipe proved it. Few things in life are as good as you imagine. I imagined what the perfect loquat crumble could be, and this recipe delivered! Ok, so on that note, I followed this recipe by the book, with the following exceptions:\n\n1: we have a ton of ripe loquats, so I used ~100, which is probably close to 2x what the recipe calls for. All other measurements were unchanged. We wanted it tart, so this was in part on purpose. It took about twice as long to cook them down, as well.\n2: I used half a stick of butter on the pan instead of cooking spray\n3: I used a full stick of butter (8tbsp) in the crumble instead of 7tbsp. Why not go all the way when you're that close?\n4: I used a 9x12 baking dish instead of the cast iron skillet, due to the increased loquat volume.\n\nMy wife and I both think that the ratios came out perfect with using 2x as many loquats. Your milage and tastes may vary. As written the recipe may be too sweet for our tastes.",

One comment I received was \u201cMore crumble!\u201d And two people said, \u201cit would be better if the loquats were peeled.\u201d Well I made one like that today but haven\u2019t baked it yet because I finished so late. I added cinnamon and a touch of allspice to the loquats which added another dimension to the filling. I also used Vegan butter in all of my recipes and it came out every bit as good as butter (without clogging my husband\u2019s arteries!). Since I have four loquat trees (yes - 4!!!), I still have about a thousand loquats. So still looking for other vegan recipes that I can use them in before the season is over. Although today I saw a squirrel on the top branch and I swear he was pelting me with loquats because I was taking his harvest. It was raining loquats all around me. ??",
