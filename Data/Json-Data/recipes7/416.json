However she had a topping that consisted of 4 tbl butter and 4 tbl Karo syrup cooked together for about 3 minutes. She alternated whole walnuts and marashino cherries about 4 or 5 of each around the top of the cake and then poured the warm mixture of Karo and butter on top of the cake allowing it to drizzle down the side of the cake. Very pretty as well as yummy.",

I adore homemade pound cake to begin with and when you add the fabulous flavor of black walnuts it is really something special. I can't help but wonder if the reviewer who called this recipe \"bland\" didn't mistakenly use English walnuts instead of the black walnuts that were called for? This is not an in-your-face commercial-tasting cake nor an over-the-top super chocolate chocolate something. It is the perfect blend of creamy butter flour sugar and earthy/mapley black walnuts. I made this for my husband's birthday and I am going to bake a fresh one for my mother's Christmas present. She knows how much work I put into gathering and processing these black walnuts!",
