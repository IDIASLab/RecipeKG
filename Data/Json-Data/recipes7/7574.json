I followed the recipe as written except that I used the whole squash (it was a small one but amounted to more than a cup) and I only used 1 tbsp total of maple syrup (personal preference). I had to substitute regular broccoli for the baby broccoli as I couldn't find any baby broccoli at the store. Once the dish was ready I thought it could use a little kick so I added a dash of red pepper flakes. That did indeed add another depth of flavor that my boyfriend and I really liked. I served it with cornbread and garlic chicken. I will definitely make this again and I will keep an eye out for baby broccoli so I can use it next time. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!",
