Subbed broth for the beer.\" My daughters loved dumping the measured ingredients into the crockpot, along with breaking up the tomatoes. I guess I've grown accustomed to using canned diced tomatoes in chilis that this was unexpected! Took cook's note and instead of water, used chicken broth for the beer. This was a pretty good chili, but alas, the Italian Seasoning was a bit much - next time around, I would halve if not quarter how much of it goes in.",
