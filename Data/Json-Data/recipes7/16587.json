It's a great starting point for making additions based on what is on hand- blueberries, dried chopped figs, chocolate chips. When my bananas are extremely ripe, I cut the sugar in half. I also like to add a little flavoring and spices- teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon.  For extra health I also substitute other ingredients for some of the flour  such as pea protein and ground flax. Also, coconut oil substituted for the butter works well.",

I've been following another recipe that called for less bananas and was much more dense and kind of dry. This is my new go-to!! I followed it exactly except added a little shaved dark chocolate. I don't even know if that did much though. The muffins are delicious. My kids husband and I love them.",
