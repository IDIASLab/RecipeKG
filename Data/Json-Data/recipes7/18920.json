MISTAKE! This was too long so I had to wait for them to soften for cutting. This recipe is similar to another Alfajores recipe I've used. This one adds 1/4c sugar. After combining the flour to the butter mixture the dough will be crumbly this is OK. You can work it by hand on a lightly floured surface into 2 logs. Mine were 1.75\" diameter. The dough was easy to cut and may be placed fairly close to each other on the cookie sheet. They expand but not that much. In the past I've worked the dough into a disc Saran wrapped chilled then rolled to 1/4\". I use a small round cookie cutter dipped in flour to get consistent-shaped cookies. These cookies are good but I'll stick to my old recipe that stay more crisp/crunchy; a personal preference. Like another reviewer said don't overbake; they'll stay the light pale colour when done.",
