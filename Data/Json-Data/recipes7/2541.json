I used 2 c. heavy cream and 1 c. half and half as I wanted a bit richer and smoother final result. After tasting the mixture I felt it needed another 1/2 tsp. of root beer extract (I used Watkins) and it was perfect. However this may or not be the case with other brands of root beer extract or root beer concentrate such as McCormick's so taste first. It DOES taste like a root beer float!",

The vanilla extract gives it that vanilla ice cream in the root beer flavor. I will surely make this when the grandchildren are coming. Root beer has always been one of their favorite flavors. This recipe sure brings back memories of the soda fountain days. Thanks Grace Gutberlet for sharing!",
