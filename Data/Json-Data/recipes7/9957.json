The onion and celery give it the crunch, the mustard and spices the flavor, and the sweet relish and bit of sugar the sweetness it needs.  I did not use pecans, lemon juice, dill, or paprika because I did not have them, but it had plenty of flavor without!   I used 2 large cans of chicken breast which made this recipe quick and simple!  Next time I have leftover chicken I will use it!  This in my opinion is the best basic chicken salad recipe!",
