I also let the fruit stand once I added lime and sugar so that I can get a sense of how much liquid will precipitate. Once I saw that it was easy to mix in the right amount of corn starch. I think 2 cups of sugar are too much and will use 1 cup white and 1/2cup brown next time.",

On filling: - I used all sugar suggested but - only two tsp of cinnamon (I can t even imagine using two tablespoons of cinnamon in one pie). Might even try just one teaspoon cinnamon next time. - Added a teaspoon of vanilla. This was probably the prettiest and most beautiful pie I have ever made. Definitely worth the little extra effort to do the egg wash and cinnamon sugar sprinkle on top! Can t wait to make it again for my dad who loves apricots!",
