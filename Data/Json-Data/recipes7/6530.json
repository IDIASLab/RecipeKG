This cake is FANTASTIC!! Lemon-lime soda makes a great substitute if you don't have peach nectar around. I would recommend halving the glaze - I thought the 2 cups of powdered sugar concoction was too much - it puddled around the base and made the bottom a little soggy, and I had to keep pouring it back into the bowl and re-drizzling it over the top trying to use it all. The glaze is a great addition, but I think half would be perfect. Great recipe!!",
