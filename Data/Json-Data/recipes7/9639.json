I did add in an additional teaspoon of baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt. I added the cherry juice into the wet ingredients instead of waiting until the end (to prevent overmixing) and I tossed the cherries in the dry ingredients to help prevent sinking. I made no other changes. Baked at 350*, they were done at just over twenty minutes. My family made quick work of these, they were pretty much gone by mid-day. My husband actually called me at home to ask if I could make more. DELICIOUS!",

I did use gluten free flour and I also added a splash of vanilla extract along with the almond. I used coconut oil and because we don't normally use white sugar I used an unprocessed cane sugar in place of that. And I used dark brown sugar in the topping. I also used buttermilk instead of milk and added a pinch of baking soda. They are nice and tender but just a little bland. I think next time I'll add some grated orange or lemon zest or oil and see how that works out. The recipe's a great idea and a keeper but it needs a little more flavor for us. Thanks for posting!",
