I did use part whole wheat flour. I did need almost 1/4 of a cup more flour than the recipe called for to get it to form into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes. Once it was done kneading I set it to rise in a covered greased bowl on a warm heating pad until it doubled. I then used my 1/2 cup dry measuring cup to measure out balls rolled them tight and plopped them into 12 greased muffin tins. I let it sit on the warm heating pad covered with saran wrap for a half hour then baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Out of the oven I brushed each roll with vegetable oil to make a soft top. I got twelve GINORMOUS rolls out of this recipe (I made them bigger so that I would not have to use two muffin tins) instead of two loaves. This bread recipe is quite good. I was worried that the amount of yeast might not be enough but it rose perfectly and still made one of the biggest rolls I've ever seen. This bread IS a little on the sweet side if you're looking for a more savory-yeasty roll this may not be for you. My whole family loved it it paired nicely with Potato Soup. I'll make this again.",

I'm just not a huge fan of the heating/cooling thing with the milk and prefer to just get the water at the right temp from the get go. It's a laziness thing (or just efficiency) I'm sure. I did this in my KA mixer. Tossed in the water yeast and a little of the sugar let it foam (maybe 10 mins) and then added everything else except the final cup of flour. Put the dough hook on and let the KA do all the work. When it comes together I add the final flour a little at a time until the dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. Once its good I let it knead for me on speed 2 for about 7 minutes. Then you can pick up in about the middle of step 3 here.",

                "reviewBody": "I was doubtful that this bread would turn out ok as I baked it and I was right. The teaspoon of yeast, I thought was not enough. However, I made the recipe as written assuming that sugar/honey would help the yeast to work better. It didn't. After 90 minutes into the second rise, the bread barely rose. At 2 hours, the bread reached the rim. It didn't have much oven spring. Also, it was too sweet for a white bread. It think this dough is better suited to cinnamon bread/rolls. I'm giving it 3 stars. However, I will try to make it again. Other factors may have been at play - mainly the cold weather. I will update the review then.",
