Recently switched to whole wheat, so I wanted to try a new muffin recipe out. This is the one that not only turned out great, but filling as well. When I was eating it, I was craving eggs. Next time I will have to remember to throw in a fried egg or two on the side. I made 6 jumbo muffins.",

The only change I made was tossing the blueberries in a little flour before adding to the mix so they don't sink to the bottom. The muffins were nice and fluffy - so A on that. The flavor was just ok not bad just nothing over the top. I would recommend using low-fat buttermilk instead of skim butter not necessary and when just soft doesn't mix well. Try adding in some vanilla or plain Greek yogurt.",
