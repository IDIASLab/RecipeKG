                "reviewBody": "Beautiful dessert that came together in minutes.  I liked the shortbread crust, which was a nice change from the standard graham cracker crust -  I used white rather than brown sugar and it was tender and easy to cut and serve.  The filling is pleasantly sweet and nicely laced with the lemon zest. As for the topping, I found I needed to add a little water to get it a little saucier.  Those who find most desserts too big for their needs, or for those who would simply like smaller sized desserts just so they can bake more often, may find it interesting to note that I easily scaled this down to three servings and prepared it in a 6\" square baking pan. In this smaller version, the crust needed just 9 minutes to bake, and the filling only 20 minutes.  This will yield four very generous servings, or 6 more \"reasonable\" sized servings.",

                "reviewBody": "I am rating this 5 stars because of a few little changes I made. I think the author may have made an error by not adding liquid to the blueberry filling. I added the juice of a whole lemon to a measuring cup, then topped it with water until it filled a half cup. Then stirred the cornstarch into the lemon water before cooking with the blueberries and sugar. Because there is so much sour cream in the filling, I added two tablespoons of flour to give it more structure so it set up quicker. I mixed it all by hand so I didn't add too much air to the filling as I like a smooth, silky cheesecake; banging the pan on the counter a couple times also help the air bubbles rise to the top so it comes out smoother. As written this cake is very sweet, by cutting the sugar in half in all 3 layers, this pie is out of this world good, and is a must make dessert if you have blueberry lovers to please!!",

Maybe I pressed it into the baking dish too firmly. I'm not sure that would have made a difference. Also my cheesecake was completely baked and cracking at the minimum baking time. I also added several extra handfuls of blueberries. I added enough water to moisten the sugar before making the blueberry topping. Next time I may add a touch of lemon juice to the topping as it's incredibly sweet.",

In fact it's so hard that the cheesecake segment separates as pieces are cut 2) the texture came out a bit rubbery not like some of the other cheesecake recipes from this site which are the typical NY cheesecake and 3) the overall flavor is off a notch or two from most cheesecake recipes. The best part of the recipe is the blueberry topping which was excellent. I did add a little water about 1/4 cup so the mixture wouldn't burn as it was heated. I reduced the sugar a bit on the cheesecake and blueberry mixtures so it wouldn't be too sweet.",
