I refrigerated it for 4 hours before serving for the flavors to meld. I served it to guests and they loved it.",

With that in mind I made this recipe as we like the combination of the other ingredients. My changes were to cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and to add equal parts of milk and vinegar but only enough to achieve the consistency I was looking for. As written it would have been a 1 star - but adjusting the dressing it was a 4 star for us. One note - in the submitters write-up they suggest hard boiling the eggs with the macaroni. That should never be done because of germs that might be on the outer egg shell. Be safe and boil them in a separate pan.",
