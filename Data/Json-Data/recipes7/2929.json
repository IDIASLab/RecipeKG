My son and I made these on New Year's Eve (trying to rid ourselves of the candy canes in the house) and after they cooled we stored them in a large Tupperware container. The flavor enhanced overnight and we iced them today. We are taking them to my stepdaughter's house. They made just about 60 like stated--some of dough balls were larger than others. I believe I had 58 so had we made some smaller there would have been well over 60. There was one review that stated the cookie was dry. It is not a chewy cookie and they are fab with milk or coffee.

The cookies were soft in the middle and had the perfect amount of peppermint flavor and sweetness. I didn't wind up rolling the cookie dough in the sugar and only used 2 tablespoons of skim milk when making the glaze for a thicker consistency and added a tiny drop of peppermint extract to it. If your cookies came out too dry or crumbly chances are are you added too much flour probably inadvertently by scooping the flour directly into the cup. In order to prevent this I scoop flour with a spoon and dump the flour into the measuring cup and give the cup a little shake each time I add the flour. Level the measuring cup off using the straight edge of a butter knife.",
