                "reviewBody": "Sorry I really wanted this to work out but it just didn't for me. I didn't add as much xanthan gum as listed; it seemed superfluous. I've tried many different alternative flours and combinations and this was by far the worst. I used this mix in many recipes that I had previously used white or brown rice flour based mixes and this one just didn't do what it says: replace wheat flour cup-for-cup. From breads to cakes; cupcakes and pancakes everything came out chewy tough and gummy. With the last of the batch I made crepes and even those came out chewier than they should. The xanthan gum also lumps up in it. I had read that sweet rice flour is not to total more than 20 percent or so of any gluten free flour blend. This statement seems true. The xanthan gum simply makes it worse-gummy and rubbery. Sweet rice flour is already so glutinous (sticky) it should be enough to eliminate the need for other gluten replacers. Also adding the salt and sugar makes need to then adjust the recipe your are working with. Thank you for posting though. I'm sorry it didn't work out for me.",

                "reviewBody": "This was an interesting experiment.  I would say flavor-wise, it's pretty close to wheat flour.  I used this mixture to make pancakes.  Don't assume that it's a 1:1 swap for real flour -- to get my batter to even be usable, I had to more than double the liquid factor, so experiment, experiment, and experiment, with both cook times and liquid. The pancakes I made took so incredibly long to cook all the way through.  I thought that maybe it was because the batter was really thick, so I took a portion and tried thinning it out some more, but that messed with how well the pancakes rose and they still took a long time to cook through.  The texture also left a lot to be desired.  There was a kind of gumminess to it, and I'm thinking it might be the xantham gum.  That stuff is weird, albeit a good binder.  I gave this three stars despite the problems,though, because I think it has potential -- it did have good flavor and, it just needs to be tweaked and experimented with, which I plan on doing.  Good work, Melissa!  I'll be making this again.",
