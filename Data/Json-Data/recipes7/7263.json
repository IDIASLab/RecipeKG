I noted that this updated recipe calls for a couple of extra ingredients (i.e.: mayonnaise & sugar); we have always just used the bare essentials - white bread a juicy tomato a pinch of salt and smooth peanut butter. We tried the recipe with the updated extras - it was indeed good and tasted similar to what we have always enjoyed; but we feel you cannot beat the original.",
