I loved that it didn't contain oatmeal or water and the topping was excellent - buttery with a nice crispy crunch as it should.  But... there was too much of it for the amount of apples, which made it seem much  too sweet.  Unfortunately there was no way I could use it all and I discarded the excess.  I think adding half again as many apples would be an improvement that would elevate this to 5-star status.",

Love using Jonagolds as they don't get too soggy, and I cut them into chunks. If you find the topping a bit sweet, 3/4 cup sugar works great. I use a whisk to 'sift' the dry ingredients - so much easier and gets the job done well. So glad to have this simple and amazing recipe!",
