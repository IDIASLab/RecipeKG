I pour an entire bag of powdered sugar on the counter (wax paper or whatever work space you're using). I buildup the powdered sugar like a bowl and pour the candy mixture into the sugar. Then I quickly knead the powdered sugar into the candy. You don't want to over work it or it will be too stiff. Once  kneaded in the powdered sugar, roll it out (kinda thin, less than 1/4 inch). Mix a little butter into the peanut butter before spreading over the candy, not too much though, just enough to spread easier. Spread the peanut butter and roll up the candy.  Cut into pieces and store in an air-tight container.",

Take a bath towel fold in half and cover with powder sugar the WHOLE area where you will smooth candy out. 3. Use you hands NOT a roller and cut slices with a piece of sewing thread?? 4. Cook to 250 anything higher will make it hard and crack. 5. After you get this recipe down it is well worth it??",

                "reviewBody": "My major criticism is that it takes an almost sinful amount of butter applied to the wax paper to keep it from sticking and tearing apart. Also this recipe does NOT double well at all. Alsoot won't work when the humidity is over 50%. The things I did find that worked for it were: Beat the eggs to very stiff foam and turn the mixer off while the candy finishes. Do not use fresh eggs. They foam too much and will cause a mess. Let the corn syrup mixture reach 265-270. At this point turn your eggs back on low and slowly pour in the candy mix. Turn the speed to medium and just walk away. It took mine about 30 minutes to properly set up to a ready to pour point. If you can make it through how finicky this recipe is you actually do end up with some delicious candy.",
