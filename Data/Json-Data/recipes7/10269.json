I am not sure. I followed the recipe exactly only using a frozen banana because my blender can handle it. Frozen bananas also just make smoothies more creamy. I also had to sub the pinch of nutmeg for a pinch of pumpkin pie spice not being able to locate my nutmeg. If you like the taste of yogurt and peanut butter this may be of interest. However I would try it first without and then with the strawberries. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin either. It is a healthy addition though. I got 2 large to 3 small servings instead of the 4 if counting calories.",
