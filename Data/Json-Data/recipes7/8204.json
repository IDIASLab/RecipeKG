I make a flour mix for baking that is quarter each of rice, sorghum, tapioca, and chestnut flours, with a pinch of xanthan gum, then use it in place of flour...sifting or whisking helps. I dusted with confectioners' sugar...looks nice with the dark chocolate.",

Just beat the softened butter, eggs and vanilla together and then add the dry ingredients\n3)  Xantham gum.  What is that?  Whatever it is, my cookies were not missing it\n4)  Bake according to instructions.\nMelt in your mouth delicious!!",

They turned out so good I made a second batch (needed gluten free for church function) and accidently forgot to add the vanilla and I think they tasted better without the extract. Thank you for this wonderful recipe it is so hard to find great tasting gluten free recipes my boys didn't even know they were gluten free.",

They were amazing warm from the oven and still soft the next day. They did sort of begin to crumble easily the day after that, but by then they were practically gone, so oh well.\n\nI used Robin Hood all purpose gluten free flour instead of the combination of flours listed in the recipe.  I spooned the dough onto cookie sheets using a tablespoon and ended up with about 40 cookies. They spread nicely as they baked and made neat little 2\" cookies. The flavour was great - super chocolaty! The texture wasn't quite like a traditional cookie, but it was close. I'm not a huge baker and I have practically no experience with gluten free cooking/baking, so I highly recommend this recipe for anyone looking for an easy gluten free dessert.",
