I have had biscuit type cobblers, cake type cobblers, and pie crust (I know...not really a cobbler but my Mamaw called it that so....to me it was a cobbler) type cobblers. This is almost a \nmixture of all three! And it is delicious. Hubby took one bite and said, \"just like my mom's!\" That sealed the deal right there. She was an\namazing cook. We loved the amount of berries in this one too... 6 cups! Blackberries aren't really in season here yet, so my berries, although \npretty big, where not as sweet as I like. I was worried about the amount of sugar but it was perfect. IF my berries are sweeter next time, I MAY cut the sugar just a tad but with the amount of topping this makes, it was perfect.\nThis is not a dainty or thin cobbler. It is big and thick, which I really love because several others I have tried have been thin. The berry to crust ratio\nseems just right. The amount of cornstarch called for was spot on as well. Just a really, really good recipe that will be a repeat here many times this summer. Thanks for sharing, Baron!",

I was concerned about the quantity of sugar (I don't care for dishes too sweet) and had intended to add a bit of lemon juice to the berries but forgot.  I'm glad I didn't as the dish was perfect.  Normally, I use a biscuit-type topping for cobblers but I doubt I'll do so again.  This topping is perfect for many fruits.  I can't wait to try it with peaches.

I felt like there was too much milk called for in the topping, but I went ahead and put in the 2 cups. The batter was very thin, but I went with it. When I poured the batter on top, it swirled down into the blackberries, and settled on the bottom. I baked it for well over an hour, because the top wasn't really setting or browning. I was really disappointed.",
