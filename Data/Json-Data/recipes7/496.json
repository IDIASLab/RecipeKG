For the purposes of this recipe you don't have to completely clarify it though, just heat the butter in the microwave and skim off the fat that floats on top before adding it to the mix. It is also nice if you add the hot butter to the cold milk so that it solidifies again and creats butter pockets in the pancakes when they cook.",

I'm not a huge eggnog fan I go back and forth on it (although I do occasionally substitute eggnog for cream in my coffee so I had some on hand). My only criticism was that the eggnog made the batter very thick so the pancakes were slightly burned before they cooked through. I'd suggest substituting up to half of the eggnog with milk. I used lowfat eggnog and skim milk. They were delicious!",

I did not use Clarified butter but they would have come out better if i had since they are thick it does take longer to cook the inside than regular pancakes. We had leftovers so we wrapped them in wax paper and froze them. When i ran off to work in the morning i grabbed them and ate them cold in the car after they had thawed for 30 minutes and they were even better cold!!! Very good quick morning treat!",
