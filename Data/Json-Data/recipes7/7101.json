I will say that it did have a nice light taste but I felt the dressing really was lacking in flavor. It was good for lunch today sprinkled with a few toasted slivered almonds and the olive oil coated the greens nicely but I'll probably stick with another strawberry salad recipe which is even lower in fat. Nonetheless a nice recipe for sure.",
