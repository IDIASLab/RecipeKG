First, you cannot skip the freezing the cookie dough step...if you do, the dough WILL bake along w/the cake and be very dry.  It's also imperative you don't overbake (or you'll get the same dry baked cookie results); I actually usually only bake about 16-18 min.  I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH, DO NOT OVER BAKE!  It will seem like it's too early to take them out, but it's not.  Check the outer ridge of the cupcake (otherwise you're getting the dough on your toothpick which should stay *wet*).  These are great w/pretty much any cake flavor and can be made even easier by using prepared cookie dough (just don't skip the freezing step!).  When I try a new chocolate chip cookie dough recipe (or even bake old favs), I always double it and freeze some cookie dough balls for future batches of these!  I HAVE tried this as a cake, but have yet to perfect the cookie dough ball size/bake time...when I get it *right*, I'll add the dimensions/bake time to my review.  THANKS, everyone, for trying (and rating and posting pics of!) my recipe!  Enjoy!",

So let me preface this by saying that on the rare occasions Hubs REALLY likes something he'll say it's so good he could eat it till he got sick. Having said that, I made and froze the cookie dough the day before, exactly as the recipe directs. The next day it was a breeze to get these in the oven and if you follow LTH's tips, these come out exactly as she says they will. I used a chocolate cake batter, a vanilla buttercream, and garnished with a mini chocolate chip cookie.  Too cute. And the inside? A delightful, gooey, chocolate chip cookie dough surprise that Hubs' staff all loved.  As for Hubs? I do believe he \"made himself sick.\" Thanks for sharing your wonderful and creative cupcakes LTH!",

And personally, I liked the contrast in color between the chocolate cupcake and the cookie dough inside.  The only thing I would have to say about this is...next time I would use mini chocolate chips in the cookie dough.  I bet you could also use those prepared \"break & bake\" cookies that they sell in the grocery store to save some time & effort.  These came out yummmmmy!  I dunked my cupcakes in chocolate ganache (1 cup choc chips & 1/2 cup heavy cream in a double boiler)...as if there wasn't enough choc in this recipe.   Chocolate chip cookies in a cupcake covered with MORE chocolate- who could ask for anything more in a dessert?",

                "reviewBody": "These were great :)  The changes I made were minimial. (Quantities listed are for 12 servings) I used 5/8 cup EACH (translated 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup) sugar & brown sugar. Instead of adding a raw egg... I used 2 Tbsp milk (2 Tbsp milk = 1 egg) and then increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup (yes I know, again this was not for 24 cupcakes, but 12).  Mix all ingredients together - Using a 1.5 tbsp scoop, shape the dough into balls  freeze overnight.   I chose not to use a boxed cake mix...ugh!  Instead I used a cake recipe that made these POP! 3/4 cup softened butter 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 2 eggs 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour 1/2 tsp EACH baking powder & baking soda 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 cup milk 1 tsp. vanilla extract  Cream butter & brown sugar, Add eggs, sift dry ingredients, alternate adding dry ingredients w/ milk, begin and end w/ flour mixture, stir in vanilla Fill cupcake liners w/ 3 Tbsp batter, press the frozen cookie dough into the batter. bake at 350\u00b0 16-18 minutes  This will be MUCH better than the boxed mix.. Frosting..oh yes!  1 1/2 cups softened butter 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp light brown sugar, packed 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar 1/4 tsp. salt 1 Tbsp. milk 1 tsp. vanilla extract  Cream ingredients together, pipe onto cooled cupcakes, sprinkle w/ more choc chips :D  That's the 5 star cupcake!!!",
