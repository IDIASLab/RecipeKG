                "reviewBody": "OK. Confession. When I was younger and I'd make a cake, I'd always filch batter. By the spoonful. Couldn't help myself! As a result, my cakes were never very tall. Fast forward a few decades. I'm diabetic. No more tastes when baking for me! Even so, nothing prepared me for how much batter this recipe made. I got three very full 9\" layers and 8 cupcakes. Couldn't believe how I just kept filling cupcake papers. How could anyone possibly fit this into \"2- 9\" pans\"??? Anyway, I tasted one of the cupcakes, and was absolutely blown away by the texture - so moist with a fine, light crumb. It's everything you love about a mix cake, minus that obnoxious, artificial flavor. Those who say it was dense, there are a couple of possible causes. You could have beaten too much after the flour was added, encouraging formation of gluten, the protein in flour that gives structure to breads. Simply incorporate the flour gently and stop, which will obviate that problem. Or perhaps you opted for all purpose flour instead.  Big mistake. If you don't have cake flour, measure out 3-1/2 cups all purpose and add 1/2 cup cornstarch. Sift 3 times. If you used cake flour, did you sift? Sifting aerates your flour. If your product was dry, that indicates packing your flour when measuring (be sure to spoon the sifted flour lightly into your cup  and sweep the back of a knife to level,) overbaking, or a temp that was too high. Calibrate your oven using an oven thermometer every 3 months.",

                "reviewBody": "Overall this produced a good cake, but I have a few points for others. 1. This makes more batter than 2-9inch cake pans worth. More like 3-9inch cake pans. FYI. 2. This cake is a slow cooker - I made it in a 9x13 and it took over an hour to test done (it had browned a bit on top but that's normal in butter cakes, if that's going to bother you, find a shortening or oil cake recipe). This is because of the amount of batter -- reduce if you don't need 3 cakes or a 3-4 inch thick sheet cake. 3. I stored my cake in the fridge due to how I frosted it, so I can't speak to the moistness (the fridge sucks the moisture out of cakes and breads, so never bash a baked good that you stuck in the fridge without pre-tasting) but I can say that it came out with a much denser crumb than cakes made with all-purpose flour, however it was tender to the mouth and fork. This cake would hold up well for cutting into layers, etc., much like pound cake (but tasting different). Overall I was pleased with this recipe but as one of the early reviewers I wanted to go ahead and point out a few things about this cake before people make it expecting Betty Crocker boxed mix and then downrate it. Thank you Alicia, we enjoyed your recipe!",
