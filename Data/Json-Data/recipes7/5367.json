And I mean that literally. I soaked it with the entire amount of simple syrup but even a day later the cake was very chewy. I think if I tried again I'd split the cake into three layers rather than two; the cake is easy to slice and handles well so it wouldn't be a problem to cut it into thinner layers. However I think I'll probably just use a different sponge cake recipe. I love the frosting part though and will definitely make it again. Oh and it goes without saying (but I'll say it): high-quality ingredients really matter in this cake.",

While the balls popped out of the iron easy as a dream and LOOKING fabulous they were dry and a bit bitter tasting. I am not a fan of simple syrup glaze so that could be part of my problem. Butter vanilla and a bit more sugar should do the trick to keep this moist and a bit sweeter. I will try again.",
