I followed other reviewers' advice and went a little heavier on the mint (it wasn't overpowering at all) used only 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard and used 1 teaspoon of sugar. I didn't have enough white vinegar so I mixed it 50/50 with red wine vinegar. This would also work great as a salad dressing on a tomato salad with feta cheese. Thanks for the recipe! My first time ever making lamb chops and it was awesome thanks to this sauce.",
