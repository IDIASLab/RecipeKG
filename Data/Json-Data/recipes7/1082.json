See taste buds on your tongue vary from person to person which means that what may taste good to some people may not taste good to others. You should think of all of these recipes on this site as base recipes recipes you can tweak so that you like it. Going forward for those of you complaining that the sauce is too sweet here is how I made my sauce: Keep the seeds in the peppers for the sauce they add heat. Cut the sugar down to 2 tbs. And there you have it it's a szechwan sauce that my taste buds enjoy. Keep it mind that doesn't mean that yours will.",

It was extremely easy and quick and my boys (ages 4 6 and 32) all loved it! I added 1T soy 2T oyster sauce and subbed some prepared dijon-style mustard for the peppers. (I had it on hand and didn't want the sauce too spicy.) Because I used frozen veggies I added between 1 and 2T cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Very happy with the results from this very basic recipe. Can't vouch for the authenticity of the taste but definitely a keeper at our house.",
