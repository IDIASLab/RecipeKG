Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!",

                "reviewBody": "5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!  But I must say this the roux is the KEY, if you don't make this right you can hang it up. \n\n1st things 1st, to get the roux the deep brown that's authentic to New Orleans style it take WAAAAAAAAAAY longer than 20-30 minutes. Lets double it, it takes 1 hour & using a wisk & constantly stirring on medium low heat. I did adjust the heat to high when starting but was stir quickly like a madman then reduce heat to medium low.  A new orleans native told me the darker you get that roux the better. \n\n2nd - YOU MUST USE FILE POWDER .... it really brings in the flavor and authenticity of New Orleans  Creole taste. Now it was hard to find but you can get it at any health food store some say (Whole Foods) but I got mine down street at Sevenanda health food store. \n\nYes this recipe is THE BOMB!! and it does take 3 hours & 40 minutes... almost 4 hours depending on how long you stir your roux, I did at least an hour & 10 minutes.\n\nNow after adding the seafood, you can remove the whole pot from the eye because the Gumbo will be so hot it will cook your shrimp, scallops, & crab meat. I didn't add my seafood till the last 5 minutes while on the stove then I removed it from the stove. Let it cooled down naturally , then put in the fridge served it w/ rice & corn muffins... EVERYONE LOVE IT!! I made a huge pot of it in my 8 quart Dutch Oven. \n\nI'm so proud this came out so perfect since it was my 1st attempt to making gumbo.",

It's delicious!  A note about making a roux - stop working so hard!  You can make it in the oven and it is perfection - thanks Alton Brown.  Whisk 4 oz all purpose flour and 4 oz veg oil in a cast iron skillet, place in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every half hour.  It comes out nice and dark and DOES NOT BURN!!!  Once you remove the roux from the oven, follow the recipe directions by adding the celery, bell pepper, etc. and continue with the recipe.  You're welcome.  ;~)  Oh, and those who are shaming the person who submitted the recipe for giving away a family recipe, get over yourselves!  The submitter never says it was a secret family recipe, just that it was never written down.  We all share recipes our families love, and I am thankful this gumbo recipe was shared!",

When i tell you that everyone LOVED this gumbo i mean EVERYONE. I now have been asked to make it for a superbowl party. The recipt was simple and very easy to make.  I made a couple very small changes but that was my choice. I didnt use the bacon drippings because i burn the first roix i tryed to make ( not much a suprise) and i didnt feel like going to get more bacon so i used butter worked great and got it right the first time. The store was sold out of andouille so i went with the next best thing for texans Earl Camble hot links. Honestly Liked it better then andouille and no one noticed the change. I added shredded chicken breast and used crab legs instead of the lumb crab meat presentation just looks better with the crab legs hanging out the pot and bowls . Other then that followed it to the T and it was the BEST GUMBO I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!! Thanks for sharing this one. And you should be ashamed of yourself for giving away that secret, But im sure glad you did.!!!!!!",
