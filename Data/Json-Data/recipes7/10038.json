Also, those are not the times i put.  If you are making mini-muffins: cook 17-20 minutes.  If you are making full size muffins cook 25 - 30 minutes.  These muffins don't rise when baking so fill up the  cup. You can always spice these up with some hot peppers and spicy cheese.  I hope you all enjoy these as much as my family does!",

They had a nice flavor but I think they'd be better w/more meat or perhaps the meat cooked in the muffin to add a little moisture. That being said I DO think these would be a hit w/kiddos and are quick and easy to throw together. They took close to 30 minutes in our oven to be set. THANKS for the recipe (and for the review update; I DID forget the cheese when I was reading directions even though I'd ready your review...I was able to simply pull the mixture and mix it in before I baked them).",

I 1/2 the recipe & ended up doing more mustard than ketchup the recipe 1/2 called for 1/4 cup & 2 tbsps ketchup I did 1/4 cup mustard & 2 tbsps ketchup. I'd have done a bit more ketchup but I like mustard better & all I had was a couple ketchup packets I gotta get ketchup just for this recipe. Then it called for 1/2 a tsp mustard I did 1/2 tsp hot sauce. Everything else was how the recipe called for it. I can see how they would taste like sliders if I had put enough ketchup in. Next time I make this I will have to put a bit less mustard & more ketchup I put too much mustard for even my taste they're still really good but had me wanting to put ketchup on top of them. Next time I will also put a can or 2 of jalepenos. We love jalepeno cheese burgers & that would be the perfect addition to these although if I put in jalepenos I might have to keep the ketchup as I did it the first time Im not big on ketchup especially not with jalepeno cheese burgers. This is a great base recipe! & first time I've ever heard of such a thing. I look forward to messing around with extra ingredients to zaz it up. I give this 5 stars before any of my alterations. Oh & I almost forgot to write in I read the review about them being dry I didn't have any problem with that.",
