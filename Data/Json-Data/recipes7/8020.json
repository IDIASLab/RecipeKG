After your Pumpkin Roll is finished, cut in half to make 2 rolls (or I guess you could leave it as one long roll).

This doesn't take long to bake each oven may be different - mine seems to run a little on the warm side so I baked until the cake sprung back when I touched it which was close to the 10 minutes suggested.
