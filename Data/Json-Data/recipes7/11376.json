To be clear, I'm only speaking about this specific flavor of ice cream. For deep, dark chocolate, or butter pecan, I'll take the classic French-style every time. But, for sweet, juicy strawberries, I'm not a big fan of the egginess you get with the traditional method.",

Steps 3 and 4 are a repeat basically and I omitted one of them. Also, I added some of the cream into the blender with my berries and sugar...because it wouldn't blend without it.

I made this as a treat for my husband who requested Strawberry Ice Cream as our flavor of the week and we both thought it was \"just okay.\"  It's missing something for sure. In my opinion, it wasn't sweet enough and didn't taste enough like the real deal. Perhaps adding strawberry extract will help or even adding more strawberries and sugar. If you are used to starting your home made ice cream with the egg custard, you may be disappointed a little with the taste of this one. This one needs tweaking a bit.",

The only thing I did different was I put aside about 1/4 of the strawberries mixed with sugar, and cut them into smaller pieces, then added them to the ice cream about 5 minutes before it was finished i(n my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker). I won't do that next time though, because the chunks of stawberries froze like another reviewer stated. My fault, so from now on I will make this as written. Otherwise,  very smooth, creamy and absolutely delicious even though I am not a big fan of strawberry ice cream. I usually make ice cream with a custard base,  so this was a first for me. I am not  disappointed. Hubby loved the creamy flavor and requested I make this more often. Thanks Chef John!",
