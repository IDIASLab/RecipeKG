To make up for the tartness of the plums I increased the sugar for the fruit mixture to 1/3 cup, and also added a dash of nutmeg along with the cinnamon. It's perfect.",

The baking powder is either 2tbs or 2 tsp depending on where you live. In Kansas they use 2tsp but here in AK where I live that isn't enough, the batter won't rise so I added more up to 2tbs and that ended up being perfect and no funny taste. So on that aspect you adjust as needed. Made with fresh blackberries and a can of peaches over the wk end and used the juice from the peaches in the batter. It was delicious and gone quick, 3 college kids devoured it with vanilla ice cream.",
