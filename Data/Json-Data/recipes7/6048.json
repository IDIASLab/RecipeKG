We only made one change and that was upping the vanilla to a full teaspoon. I didn't really measure the chips out, I just used the random amounts I had in each bag that I had leftover from other cookies. I made no other changes. These turned out wonderfully. We baked the cookies at 350 degrees and they were done in exactly ten minutes. The boys really liked the different chips in this cookie and it was great for me because I could use up the little bits I had in my cupboard in each chip bag PLUS it made the perfect amount--neither too much or too little. This recipe's a keeper.",

I know Chef John has quite an avid following but frankly I don t get it. I ve tried a few of his recipes (which are fairly basic and generic in most instances anyway) and have been less than impressed every time particularly since he is a professional and not a home cook. In this case I found these cookies simply put greasy and unattractive. Further they are only a very slight variation of the Toll House Cookie the only difference being that he slightly increases the ratio of white sugar to brown sugar a very negligible difference in the overall outcome. I took a bite out of fairness for the purpose of this review but did not continue then again if you like the greasy and sort of flattish Nestle Toll House cookie you ll like this one too as it s essentially the same recipe. Hubs was a little more favorable than I saying they were edible but not like your grandma makes. Note: also for the purpose of submitting the best possible photo of these cookies I selected a few of the better looking ones. Most did not look as good as the picture.",

I realized half way through making them that I didn't have any vanilla extract so I substituted maple syrup 1:1 (& not even the \"real\" stuff!) and I couldn't tell the difference. I also split the recipe in half after I made it so I could some some cocoa powder to one batch & mint extract to the other. Both versions turned out really good although I could have used a little more cocoa in my chocolatey chocolate cookies! Thanks for the recipe!:)",
