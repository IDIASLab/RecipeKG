I used the zest and juice of 2 and 1/2 lemons and it was very nicely flavored. Two might be enough if you prefer medium lemon flavor. I loved the crust combo - the oat flour and white rice flour work very well together for a great texture. I did have to bake mine around 40 minutes - as she says, watch for it to set rather than browning or time. When you jostle the pan in the oven, it shouldn't jiggle. Once it set, i gave it a few more minutes and it came out perfect.",
