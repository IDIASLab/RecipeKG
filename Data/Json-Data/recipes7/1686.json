I also toasted the almonds and sesame seeds in a small skillet and added real bacon bits/pieces (about half a bag) to the pan heated through. Meanwhile I mixed up the dressing in a small bowl and once the almonds seeds and bacon were ready I added them to the dressing while hot which really nicely distributed the bacon flavor. Tossed all before serving great and so simple; I think this only took about 10 minutes tops!:D Thanks for the new recipe to add to my rotating collection of keepers!",

Also when you make the all the changes you said to make you basically have a different salad. Don't bother reviewing because you are not review the original recipe. We've had this with steak and chicken (grilled both times). I had roasted veggies but wanted some thing cook and crisp too. this fit the bill perfectly. Thanks for sharing",
