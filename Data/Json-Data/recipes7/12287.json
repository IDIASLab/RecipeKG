My 15oz container of cheese was about 3/4 full. I would cut back on the sugar just a bit the next time; if I want sweet I'd rather have it from a fruit topping. I used a 1.5 qt rectangular casserole dish. Also several reviewers mentioned the texture was smooth like a flan (from using a mixer?). I wanted a grainy texture so I mixed it by hand for about a minute and it came out the way I wanted it. I took it out of the oven after about 50 min as the sides were starting to brown. Having it warm is not the best but I was anxious to try it. I did omit the cinnamon and did not miss the crust at all. I'm sure it will be better after being refrigerated. Thanks for this very good recipe!",
