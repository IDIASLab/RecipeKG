Sorry, a \u201cdeep baking pan\u201d easily could have been clarified to a specific size, I just guessed looking at the amount of batter.  This recipe has a pound of chocolate chips in it, so I didn\u2019t think it needed another 1 cup of sugar and cut that to 1/2 cup ( could be a personal taste preference thing). I like nuts in brownies, so I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Also, watch your time and check your brownies, as mine were done in 45 minutes.  Chocolate and banana are good partners, and you definitely will taste that layer of banana.  Nice texture, nice flavor, and good brownies!",
