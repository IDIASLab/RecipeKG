The veggie combination is tasty it was just the dressing that we didn t care for. The paprika dry mustard and soy sauce just didn t complement each other IMO but I wanted to give it a try. I will say that I thought the addition of the optional mayonnaise did help but the dressing totally liquified in a very short period of time...definitely not pretty. I hate to give such a bad review being the first reviewer and I do not want to discourage anybody from trying this recipe. We all have different tastes and what tastes good to one may not taste the same to another. Sorry but I won t be making this one again.",
