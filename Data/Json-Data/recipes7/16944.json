These cookies are very easy to make and they turned out exactly as pictured. This is a firm shortbread pecan sandy type cookie. I halved the recipe and added about 2 Tbsp of flour due to high altitude but I'm not sure it was necessary...mostly it's out of habit. I also had leftover prepared caramel for apple dipping so I substituted that for the caramels and cream. Taste was great, but I'm betting the real caramels and cream are even better. I also baked these on parchment for easy clean up. Thanks for posting... I look forward to making more!",

They came out really good and I\u2019m not a huge sweets fan. Nor do I really love caramel, but I am making these for someone else. My 11 year old loved them. I did half pecan rolled and half almond rolled, because I thought I had enough pecans. Wrong. Oh well. Both came out very good. Recommend drizzling the chocolate with a fork. I tried a spoon and got globs. #notabaker",
