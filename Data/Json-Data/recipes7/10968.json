If you use minced garlic cloves there's no need for garlic powder. I used a full jalapeno. I really loved the corn onion pepper concoction! I doubled the amount of corn because I love corn. The pablano was super mild and I couldn't even really taste it on the fajitas at all. I think next time I'll try using a green bell pepper instead.",
