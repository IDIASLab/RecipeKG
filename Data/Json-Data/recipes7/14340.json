It's kind of hard to find the thinly sliced beef near where I live so I use the meat that's pre-sliced that they use for Philly Cheesesteak at Walmart. Instead of raw egg I pick out the ingredients that I want from the pot into an individual bowl of rice and me and my family share it as a hotpot. You can throw in some pre-made potstickers if you can't find the noodles.",

I fried my tofu separately and added it to the final dish because we like ours crunchy and my other change was bellas instead of shiitake because I had some on hand that needed used and because they are more affordable.
