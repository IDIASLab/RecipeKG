The batter was a little thin for me but after I let it sit for several minutes it thickened up though it was still thin. These are a hearty pancake without being real thick and they weren't gummy at all. They really did melt in your mouth like the submitter said. The ingredients are listed out of order. For them to mix properly add all dry ingredients first and then the wet. I didn't use a mixer just hand stirred until just combined. Thanks for a yummy new way to make pancakes.",
