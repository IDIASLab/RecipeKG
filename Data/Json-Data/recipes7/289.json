I too had to cook it more like 35 minutes and after reading the other posts I decided to sprinkle some cinnamon on top when it was halfway cooked. Comes out with a nice bread pudding-like consistency. I put a small dab of butter on top as soon as it came out of the oven and it melted all over the top. Will definitely make again to use up excess apples.",

I added my own little spin to the recipe though and added vanilla abstract nutmeg and lemon juice to my mixture. I also coated my pan with butter melted it in the oven and spread it around. After I used brown sugar to do a coating over the butter. When the mixture went into my pan and was ready to be placed in the oven I sprinkled it with cinnamon and brown sugar before letting it bake. it came out amazing and cooked in about 20 min. if there's anything I would change to my recipe it's that I would add more apples. I added another half of the mixture to fill up my pan and STILL only used 2 apples which was not too bright on my part. Well either way it came out tasting wonderful and I hope I helped someone with this review",
