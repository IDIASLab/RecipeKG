I have never had a \"sweet\" gravy before but figured, what the heck. OMG!!! I added some cinnamon to the mix and I swear it tasted like we were eating cinnamon rolls!! I was dying to find out what else I could dunk in this \"gravy\"...I have to say that this made WAY too much for 3 of us to eat, you know since I didn't pay attention to the serving size. It is SOOO sweet that you can't eat too much of it at once though. But I will make this again for sure...just half sized!! THANKS!",
