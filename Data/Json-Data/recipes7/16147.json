I did find that I much prefer these served warm vs room temp, so I'll be reheating the leftovers I have for sure. I made this only in 6 ramekins, and everything fit perfectly. I found that the top did not get as caramelized as I was hoping for (I think because the oatmeal absorbed too much of the sugar), but it still got some color and a bit of a crisp after about 12-14 minutes under my oven's broiler. I also think next time that I might add in an egg to the oatmeal for a bit more richness. Oh, and I assumed that the 2 tbsps of butter were for greasing the ramekins since it wasn't listed what to do with it in the directions? So that's what I did with it, and it was great! Overall, lovely recipe! Thank you!",
