I also subbed 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of all white and baked 25 minutes at 350 instead of 400. Also didn't bother to thaw the blueberries but it worked fine. Moist delectable and perfect post-Halloween breakfast or snack. Thanks!!!!",

I am always trying to reduce sugar and fat so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I did not use milk but used 1/2 cup apple juice instead to add sweetness and make up for the reduced sugar. Then I used 2 TBS melted butter and 2TBS applesauce in place of the 1/4 cup butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. They are very dense and delicious and great with coffee. I made a second batch right away using chopped prunes instead of blueberries because I didnt have any more. VERY TASTY!",

I changed the directions & it made them (look) less oaty (can hide them from the kids).  It' sneaky, but it works!  :D\nI let the oats & the milk soak for about an hour - till soft.  Once they're soft, they disappear in the muffin.  Subbed brown sugar for white & 1/4c whole wheat flour for 1/4c white flour.  To help with the denseness, I added a half teaspoon baking soda.  They could still be a bit lighter, but I wouldn't call them dense with the half teaspoon.  I'm not a big nutmeg fan so I changed spices to: 1/2t cinnamon, 1/8t nutmeg & 1/8t allspice.  The sweet potato (yeah, I subbed for pumpkin) & spice taste was soooo subtle.  I truly could barely even taste the sweet potato & the spices, not at all.  Not wanting a spice muffin, I would still at least do the spices half as much more, or even double.  The flavor was provided by the blueberries.  I added at least a cup.\nEnd comments (haha):  A good for you muffin, but I think I'd rather have blueberry-oat muffins or pumpkin/sweet potato-oat muffins instead.",
