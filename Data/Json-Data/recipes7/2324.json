I mixed up a little milk and confectioners' sugar to make a quick glaze to pour over the top for additional sweetness! The cake disappeared we will make this cake again! Thank you for the recipe!!",

Land O lakes light butter that I creamed together with the 1 c. of white sugar until light and fluffy. Then I added each egg one at a time to that mixture followed by the vanilla and milk and an addition of 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. I baked mine in a prepared 8x8 glass baking dish (used Pam for baking) and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes. I topped it with a glaze made from 1 c. of confectioners sugar and 2 Tbsp. of milk. Next time I might top this with sliced almonds - it's a keeper for cherry season.",

I used white whole wheat flour which is a somewhat obscure kind of flour but it is wholegrain without feeling like you're eating a brick. I also used granulated brown sugar and decreased it to 2/3 cup but the cake was still sweet enough. I replaced the oil completely with unsweetened applesauce. I used only 1 very large egg and used ricemilk for the milk. Ended up also sprinkling 2 tablespoons of chopped walnuts over the top of the batter before baking which was really the bottom once I turned the cake out because I used a bundt pan. I kept the cherries at 1 1/2 cups. If you want a cake WITH cherries follow the recipe guidelines. If you want a cake OF cherries add more. This was SO moist and flavorful. I might add a streusel topping next time I make it. thanks!",

Added half cup semi-sweet choc chips 3. Reduced vanilla to half teaspoon 4. Added half teaspoon almond extract I also used frozen cherries instead of fresh (cut them in half and added them frozen to the batter).
