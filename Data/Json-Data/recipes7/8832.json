                "reviewBody": "You MUST use STICK BUTTER OR MARGARINE with this recipe and not tub butter. Only stick butter keeps the cookies firm. Tub butter is too soft and won't let the cookies set up! You also need to make sure you boil the mixture for no less than 1 minute until the chocolate mixture has a shiny look to it and not dull. AND you have to be really quick getting the mix out of the pan and onto the wax paper or else it will start to \"set up\" on you and will end up breaking apart in the pan. This is a simple recipe but it does have some quirks that you should be aware of to get them to turn out their best! I've made these cookies for years and years and can honestly admit that the first time I made them I used tub butter and the \"cookies\" had to be scraped off the wax paper. The stick butter not only makes these cookies firm but it also gives them the dense fudge type texture that makes them so delicious. Waiting for them to completely cool rather than eating them warm also adds to the wonderful taste and texture of this cookie. I'm not a great chef but I can make these in my sleep and they are wonderful!!!",

Disgusting, but we loved them and had no idea Dad meant droppings!  My only recommendation is they are a bit on the sweet side.  Hard to taste the peanut butter.  I halved the sugar and added an extra  1/4 c. of peanut butter. It's perfect for us and like some of the other reviewers said, it's a very forgiving recipe on ingredients!! Thanks for sharing this. My kids love it and we now share a bit more of my history and traditions!",

I will add a few tips: 1: the recipe is forgiving meaning your measurements do not have to be exact 2: bring the mixture to a boil stirring very frequently until it boils and then once a rolling boil starts begin timing 90 seconds. When you get to 10 seconds remove from heat continuing to stir. 3: stir in the peanut butter until it mixes thoroughly and THEN add the oatmeal in small pirtions stirring thoroughly after each addition.",
