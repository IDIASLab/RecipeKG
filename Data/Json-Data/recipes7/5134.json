I also often double this recipe and make 3 times the dressing and there is always great lunch leftovers remaining. People also love the dressing so more typically goes onto the salad when you let them self serve than would normally, and that's ok, it makes it very flavorful. You can also crush up the ramen not used when making the dressing, and top the salad with these as well.  I prefer them without.",

Although it wasnt until I got halfway through the recipe that I noticed it did not call for Ramen noodles. Just the ramen seasoning. So I just had to make changes. I crushed up ramen noodles in its packaging placed them on a baking sheet and toasted them until they were golden brown. I also had left over oven roasted brined turkey that I substituted for the chicken. When making the dressing I only used about 1/2 cup olive oil( eye balled it). It might be ok with with the 1 cup but I dont like to used a lot of oil on dressings. I tasted the dressing and it was good but not great so I added about 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil. The baslamic vinegar gives this classic salad a nice change. Thanks for the post.",
