It does need to be the specified size though.  I doubled the pecans and this recipes is GREAT. The cookies must still be warm to cut - don't wait until they are cold.  The really stiff dough will cover the pan eventually even though at first it looks like it won't. I have made these cookies many times and they never last and I am giving out the recipe every time I take them somewhere.  The men seem to particularly love this cookie and my friend said they went great with tea. They have a toffee type flavor and there is something addictive about the flavor.  Also, the price of cardamom is around 75% less at an Indian or eastern type grocery store.  Don't pay the national chain prices!",

Sort of similiar in texture to some North Indian sweets I've had (sweet, smooth and very dense) A note for making the frosting, \nDo not make the frosting until after the bars come out of the oven and you are almost ready to drizzle it. This frosting stiffens very quickly as it cools and looses the nice flowing consistancy. I recommend making the frosting right before you need it, it only takes 5 minutes to make. I put watm frosting in a baggie and drizzled it over the bars.\nAdditionally, I found I needed about 1/2 cup pecans, not 1/3.",

If using salted butter cut the amount of salt to 1/4 tsp or they will be too salty (comment from a recipe recipient).",

I had read about how thick and sticky the dough was, and mine was just crumbly (sort of like shortbread cookie dough) - that's when I realized I had left out half the butter!  I went ahead and patted it into the pan like you would do with shortbread and continued per the recipe.  I cooked it a few minutes less (just kept checking by patting the dough), and cut them into bars immediately upon taking them out of the oven, then poured the glaze over.  They were probably crisper than they would otherwise have been, but extremely tasty.  I plan on adding this to my Christmas cookie repertoire.  Might even use the full amount of butter - haven't decided yet!",
