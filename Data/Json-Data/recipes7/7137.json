Made two batches and didn't like the way either turned out.  \nThe first with the recommended amount of ingredients and it just tasted like sugar with a hint of ginger at the end.  \nIn the second batch I cut the sugar by half and it was still too sweet for my taste, though I really love the sour punch of rhubarb.  With the second batch I could taste a little of the rhubarb, but it was still mostly covered by the sugar.  \nIf I were to make this again I would add a quarter of the sugar, and some pectin to thicken it up, it ended up more like a sauce or spread than a jam.\nThe ginger rhubarb combo was a great idea, though and I look forward to working with those flavors together again.",

So I was intrigued by this recipe, which called for four cups of fruit and only three cups of sugar, similar to the recipes I use. After reading the other reviews I decided to use a 2:1 ratio of fruit to sugar and kept the ginger and lemon as written in the recipe. I tasted the jam throughout the cooking process and added about two tablespoons of ginger (I love ginger) As the jam cooked down, the flavor of the rhubarb and ginger intensified and the end result was very pleasing! Cooking time was closer to 25 minutes, possibly due to altitude. The recipe yielded three 8 oz. jars of jam that set up nicely. Rachel, thanks for sharing your recipe!",
