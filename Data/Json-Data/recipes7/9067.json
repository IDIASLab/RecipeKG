My mango was perfectly ripe and juicy and added incredible flavor to this drink. The tiny carrot pieces make the smoothie look pretty and although not overpowering the ginger is the surprise ingredient that will leave people wondering \"...what is that?\" I make a lot of smoothies there's nothing about this that I didn't like and it definitely will be made again. And as if that isn't enough nutritionally this breaks down well. Nice recipe Ecco_Star.",

I find fresh ginger too strong of a flavor in anything other than a stir-fry. I will subtitute it in other recipes. The type I used was Chinese Powdered #1 from Penzey's. Their spices are very strong so I cut the amount in half. The yogurt I buy is non-fat Greek plain yogurt. I subtituted 1/3 cup of that for the 6oz of vanilla kind. Next time maybe I will add a little vanilla or sweetener to see if there is any difference. My mango was frozen and I still used the ice cubes. Even with a frozen mango not sure how someone without a high-speed blender could blend this though. It has very little liquid. I have a Vitamix blender and had to use 1/2 cup fresh oj instead of a 1/4 cup and really had to use the tamper to process it. Mine was also orange in color for some reason. ty",
