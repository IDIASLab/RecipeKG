The flavors are really excellent and I get soooo many requests for this recipe! The changes I make are to cut the sugar in the cheesecake portion down to 1 cup and in addition to the cream cheese I also add about 1/2 cup sour cream and one egg. For the topping I add an additional teaspoon of cinnamon and sprinkle a little bit of the topping onto the bottom layer of crescent roll dough before the cream cheese layer. Lastly, a half cup of butter is unnecessary in my opinion and I only use about 6 tablespoons instead of 8. Don't shy away from this because it uses prepared crescent dough, it doesn't detract from the dish at all!",
