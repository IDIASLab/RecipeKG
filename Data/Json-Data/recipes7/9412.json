Making truly excellent shortbread take a little more time than indicated. Slowly incorporating the flour is the key. Start with two cups after thoroughly blending the butter and sugar, then add the next two one at a time and the final one in quarters.  This is how my Gram made her's (which I follow as well) and it turns out perfect every time. For a little variety, add finely chopped dried fruit such as apricots, cherries or cranberries.  You can't go wrong!",

In the other half I dropped raspberry jam,  mixed lightly so there would be streaks,  and pressed into the pan with the help of plastic wrap.  They both came out delicious!!
