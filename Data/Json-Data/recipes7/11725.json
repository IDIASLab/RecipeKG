I also used an 8x11 pan so they would be thicker, I just had to add extra baking time to the crust and the filling. The crust dough seems very dry and crumbly, but it presses perfectly into the pan. Also, I use mini chocolate chips (a heaping half cup) and put them in a ziploc bag and place in a bowl of very hot tap water for some time to melt them and then just make a very small cut in the corner of the bag to drizzle. I can't believe this recipe does not have more reviews.",

The time isn\u2019t in prep, it\u2019s the baking and cool down periods. Will make again, without the chocolate topping!",
