'Only change was reducing sugar to 1 1/3c & regular ole salt to 1t.  Oh, I used 2c fresh berries; half margarine, half butter.  That shouldn't be a big deal.  Mystery!  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes & 325 for 25.  It's so moist it'll need to be eaten quickly or refrigerated.  A firm when set lemon drizzle on top would be nice for looks.  S liked.",
