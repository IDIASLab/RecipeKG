I did season the steaks with pepper and garlic salt before I browned them. ALso instead of adding water to teh steaks to cook I used beef broth. I do think that they could cook for about 45 extra minutes...about 1 1/2 hours total.",

I spiced it up with thyme basil oregano and garlic. Next time I make this I will sautee an onion and garlic with the steak. I also would replaced half of the rice water with beef or chicken broth for added flavor. All in all this is an easy dish to make.",
