Either way I don't care it was healthy and it still had a slightly fruity taste. I made 1/4 of the recipe and got about 1 cup. I subbed kale for the spinach as my only real change and my banana was frozen. I had to use 1/2 cup of water for 1/4 of the recipe to get my blender to budge and I used a Vitamix. Plan to add a little more water. This is more for the advanced smoothie drinker with the added vegetables. Note the color is brown.",

I just used apple juice instead of water because I don t have any water at the moment but still was good I didn t have to add apples. I am new to smoothies and juice making. I blended the spinach first and then just a small handful at a time of the ingredients. I am saving this one:)",
