I paired this syrup with the buttermilk pancake's II recipe also on this site and they were a match made in heaven. Thanks for posting this delicious homemade pancake syrup. You can bet this one is going in my favorite recipe file.",

Left over sauce I use in my coffee in the morning to make caramel lattes.  You can use it on ice creme or anything you wish.  I love both version the light and the dark caramel one.  Any recipe needing a caramel sauce this is, what I use now, it's fast and easy.  Oh and when they say it will foam up, it is no joke...use a big sauce pan because it is fast and it will overflow a smaller pan.",

I highly recommend doing a SLOW warm up on the sugar, butter and buttermilk. If you go too fast it can turn out grainy. I melt my butter first then add the buttermilk and sugar. Make sure the sugar has fully dissolved before adding the vanilla and baking soda. I'm so glad I found out this recipe!",
