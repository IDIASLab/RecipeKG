You may want to adjust your baking time a little to ensure it doesn't overcook.  Some people love the crispy noodles. I do not, but my mother and brother always fought over who would get to eat them. :)",

While the water comes to a boil and the noodles cook I mix all the other ingredients together except for the butter and add that mixture to the noodles and butter. One time while making this noodles cooking I found I had half the needed sugar (I know I had more sugar but the gremlins got it) so I used light brown sugar for the other half. It worked but I don't think it was good enough to change the recipe. Another time I sent some home with my 90 year old FIL who called me the next day and told me before he reheated it he added some raisins and really enjoyed the leftovers. Quite a versatile recipe and very good as written.",
