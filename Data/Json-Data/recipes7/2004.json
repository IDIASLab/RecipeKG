I think it tastes fantastic! My only criticism is that it didn't clump up like regular granola though my substitutions probably accounted for getting the proportions off. When I make it again I'll go a little lighter on the oats to make sure there's enough wet ingredients to make sure it sticks together.",

This came out super tasty! Lightly peanut butter flavored perfectly toasted oats. I used regular Jif creamy peanut butter and it wasn't overly salty. Very tasty. Good base mix - you could stir in some dried cranberries and or chocolate chips after it cooled - I think a little more nuts in the mix would be nice too.",

I used pecans for the nuts. It is very flavorful and the fact that it does not clump together doesn't bother me because I like it on yogurt and fruit. The flavors come through nicely and you do have to watch carefully to prevent burning. It helped to have the racks high up in the oven remember to stir every 15 minutes and rotate the cookie sheets. Thank you for sharing - this will become my regular recipe for granola.",
