                "reviewBody": "If you like molasses you'll like this bread! In spite of several errors on my part the loaves came out \"perfect\". I think the recipe bake time is off though - I had to bake them for 35 minutes and cover them with foil @ 25 minutes so the crust wouldn't be too dark. I screwed up the recipe instructions by mixing the oats in with the flour so I couldn't add the boiling water/molasses to soften the oats. Instead I heated the water (1.75c)/butter (coconut oil) & molasses to 115 and put it in the pan. I then added the mix of oats 2c whole wheat flour 2.5c bread flour salt & sugar in the pan then the yeast 1T gluten. Once it mixed for a few minutes I shut the machine off & let the dough sit for 15 minutes hoping it would allow the oats & wheat flour to absorb more moisture...it must have worked! I put the machine back on \"dough\" and was waiting for the \"beep\" (to add raisins) when I got a phone call. Yep - I missed the signal and I didn't realize it until it was too late. To salvage I added them when I split the dough into 2 loaves. With all of these changes the bread came out fluffy moist & delicious! I'm technically at high altitude (3800') but didn't make any adjustments for it. I do add the gluten & used \"Hungarian High Altitude Whole Wheat\" flour (from Walmart)- it has 4g protein like bread flour does which might have helped. I'm going to follow the instructions next time but I can't see how the bread could be improved! Thanks Nadine!",

I put it together as I usually do making other breads but because I only made half the recipe the KA dough hook wasn t working so well so I kneaded it by hand. No big deal.

They are not molasses lovers so I used half the molasses called for and replaced the second half with honey. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. The baking time did not do well for me. 15 to 20 minutes was way too short. I ended up at 35 at 350 but it was getting a bit dark. I may try 375 for 30 next time. Just watch it carefully. Very moist and I would describe as heavy in a good way! Toasted with peanut butter on it is wonderful!",
