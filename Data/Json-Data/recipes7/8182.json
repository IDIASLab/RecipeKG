With dough you have to adjust liquid to dry ratios pretty frequently depending on the moisture in the air. The directions leave a bit to desired however. I have never and probably never will boiled bagels or pretzels for 10 minutes. 30 seconds on each side--a minute if you are determined to get the boiling in correctly--is sufficient. I've never had a problem. I also just use a tall heavy saucepan and put water and baking soda in--never a ton probably about 2-3 tbs of baking soda to 3-4 cups of water. These were very golden and nice and chewy perfectly baked at 25 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.",
