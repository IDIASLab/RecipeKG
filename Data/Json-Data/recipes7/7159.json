Everyone in the family has been trying to recreate this delicious coffee cake for years. It is moist and very flavorful. I added the strawberries because I like it a little sweeter. Rhubarb is an ingredient that you don't see used very often any more, but those of us who do use it always love to find new ways to spread the love.",

After reading other reviews I added 1 T. of lemon juice to the fruit before folding it into the batter and that gave it a subtle brightness. Next time I might try substituting pineapple and mandarin oranges for strawberries & rhubarb perhaps with coconut on top. This is a good basic recipe thank you for posting it!",

Due to the moisture content of the strawberries I roasted them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. This removes some of the excess water making the coffee cake not as \"soggy\" in the middle. Absolutely a delish dessert! I've already made 3 cakes!!!",
