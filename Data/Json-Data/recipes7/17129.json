                "reviewBody": "I definitely made some notes and changes, because when I followed this recipe exactly, I ended up with a fully-cooked quiche, with three pieces of nearly raw bacon shaped like roses, sitting in a pool of bacon grease right in the center of the quiche.  The only part of those rosettes that was edible was the top edge of the rosettes.  I added at least 20 minutes to the cooking time of the whole quiche just to get the rosettes past raw, which resulted in the top of the quiche being overly browned, even after covering it with aluminum foil to avoid said overbrowning.  \n\nAs another reviewer suggested, it makes more sense to bake the rosettes separately so that the entire slice of bacon is crisper and less raw.  Once you finish cooking the rosettes separately, you can slip them off of the toothpicks and just arrange them in the center.  This also eliminates the greasy crater in the center.",

I did have to increase the cooking time for my oven and I am in high altitude but I did not change the recipe other than the cooking time. Also I found out quickly that I was putting more than 1/4 batter into each of the muffin holders, which was too much and they would flatten out. But as long as they cooked okay they were delicious anyway. Thank you, Aisha!",
