I stirred vigorously for about a minute until it started to caramelize then poured it over the bread and added the pecan to the top. thought it would make it more visually attractive and it did.",

Also since I can't eat the nuts I substituted 1/3 cup of pumpkin seeds whole. The only issue I had was that there is 1/3 cup of water listed in recipe and not in instructions. So I omitted the water and found it worked fine. Oh also I cut the sugar to 1 cup which also worked. I did not make the topping as I was looking for a simple \"make it and bake it\" recipe but I'm sure it would be delicious. To add a final touch I sprinkled some pumpkin seeds on top once the batter was loaded into liners. I made two batches and I think 25 mins is a better cooking time as the first batch was a bit \"pale.\" The cinnamon and nutmeg blended well with sweet potato and pumpkin seeds for an early fall treat! Give this one a try---but I would pull back the sugar because even at 1 cup I thought they were plenty sweet.",
