What I liked about this recipe was the use of WW pastry flour and pumpkin and the spice seemed like a nice touch. In reality I found them to be bland very little pumpkin or spice flavor. They tasted very \"eggy\" to me. I needed more flour because the first few waffles were golden on the outside but not cooked in the middle. The cranberry relish is a unique touch but couldn't make up for the waffles. I don't think I'll make this again as nice as idea as it is.",

I tried to make waffles but they kept falling apart when I would take them out of my waffle maker. It's a new waffle maker so maybe it's the cook and not the recipe. When eating the waffles alone I thought they were not going to be sweet enough but they were the perfect flavor when mixed with the relish. I ended up making pancakes instead. This is going to be our Christmas morning breakfast for sure! All in all a delicious recipe to add to my basket of tricks. Thanks for sharing Amie!",

Used brown sugar instead of white and used mixture of all-purpose and white whole wheat flour. The main thing is that I doubled the spices (actually quadrupled for a double recipe) and added Hershey's Cinnamon Chips. As written I think the waffles would be very bland. Maybe that's why the relish is listed with it.?. I would defintely recommend at least doubling the spices. Made extra and froze them. We just pop them in the toaster on busy mornings. Kids love them.
