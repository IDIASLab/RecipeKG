At the moment, I had instant yeast and it came out perfect. I mixed the ingredients in a stand mixer following the instructions by making the well in the center and sprinkling the salt at the edges. This is important so the salt does not kill the yeast. I think it is very similar to homemade Challah. I will make it again however will definitely add sugar to my taste and possibly a bit more eggs to give it a bit richer egg flavor.",
