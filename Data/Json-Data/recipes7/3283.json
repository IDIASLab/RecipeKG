Most Chinese restaurants use this technique for their Moo-Goo's & other meat dishes. 1 Egg white & 1 TBsp corn starch mixed into a slurry. Add meat and refrigerate 1/2 hour - then cook as instructed. This will give you the restaurant quality you want. It tenderizes the meat and gives added flavor.",

Chinese is my favorite cuisine and through the years I've dined in countless Chinese restaurants and this recipe is a slight notch below most. Next time I make this I will increase the liquid mixture; the dish came out a little dry for lack of liquid. Too the liquid mixture just didn't infuse enough flavor. More garlic ginger or something needs to be added for punch. I did not have rice wine so used white wine and did not even detect it in the mix.",
