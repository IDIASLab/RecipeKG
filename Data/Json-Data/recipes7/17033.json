I only have one complaint... at 35 minutes, the chicken is perfectly done but the veggies are not. Next time (and there will be a next time because this was really good), I\u2019ll remove the chicken and let it begin resting on the cutting board and continue cooking the veggies for another 10 to 15 minutes.  I actually think this recipe should be written that way.  If properly cooked, this is definitely a 5 star dish.  I served this alongside a good old-fashioned baked potato with a red glass of wine which elevated this simple recipe to a meal worthy of any day of the week.",
