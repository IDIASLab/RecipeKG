I also did a 1/4 cup brown sugar with a 1/4 cup white sugar to equal the 1/2 cup sugar. Sprinkled cinnamon on top of crumble topping. Took to a friend's home to share and everyone enjoyed! I will definitely make it again, but perhaps I will make a little more of the crumble topping (such as 1 1/2 times the suggested recipe). A delicious impromptu dessert!",
