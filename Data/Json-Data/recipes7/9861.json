        "description": "Love Thai flavors and I felt they would be a perfect match to play off the richness of a butternut squash soup. Curry, coconut, spicy are a wonderful to balance the richness of the squash. The first time I made it was kind of an accident. I was trying to make the traditional soup but when I tasted it lacked something. I looked to see how I could punch up the flavor. First I added the curry, I had some leftover red curry paste I made, added coconut milk and I felt I had something special. Like many soups and stews the flavor is better the following day. Enjoy!",

Even at half full the soup exploded out of the lid. We simply could not hold it tight enough. We pretty much had the entire kitchen covered in soup. I would suggest using a hand blender in the soup pot or mashing the soup first before pureeing. This soup would also make an excellent sauce for a Thai Chicken dish over rice or noodles.",

I roasted the squash and carrots so I could add them to the onion mixture then blend to a puree with some stock for moisture. Once pureed I added 1 can of coconut milk (I think I'll add 2 next time) and 2 cups of stock. It must be much thicker than originally called for but I like thick soup. The chili moritas are wonderful and I will be looking for ways to use them more! I love them so much I'm going to add 4 next time.",
