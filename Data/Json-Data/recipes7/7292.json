I just told the girls it was a lime bar - they know me better than that and knew there was a \"secret\" ingredient I wasn't telling them about. I wanted to wait until everyone tried them to hear their reaction about the bars. Everyone LOVED the bars and then continued to guess for about 10 minutes trying to guess the avocado. Once they knew the ingredient they asked that the dessert box be passed around again. I came home with an empty container. I loved the zest taste in the bars and when I juiced the limes I pulled the pulp strings from the lime and added that also. When the timer went off at 25 minutes the pan didn't look like it was quite done baking but the edges were quite brown I used a glass pan. But once they cooled down and were cut they were completely baked. sueb - THANK YOU for sharing this recipe. It is certainly a winner in my house and with my friends. Can't wait for another occasion to make them again.",

I did have to make one small variation (using dried Rosemary instead of fresh (1 tsp dried = 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary)) and chose to make one other small variation as a personal preference.  I put mine in mini baking cups, instead of a large pan, so that I could have already pre-made, individual servings.  The mini cupcake style worked beautifully!   I didn't have to butter up anything - just press the flour mixture straight into the cup, and leave some room for the filling..  I used both paper and foil cups, and both turned out identically - DELICIOUS!",
