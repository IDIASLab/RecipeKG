I modified the recipe based on what I had but I think still stayed true to recipe. I had dry white beans so I started them in the crock pot the night before with some chicken broth and added the onion and garlic (no garlic and herb seasoning) half the chili powder and a generous amount of cumin. The next morning I proceeded with the recipe as written adding kale the rest of the chili powder etc. and letting it slow cook for about 6 1/2 more hours. I did use fresh kale about 4 or 5 cups rather than frozen pre-cooked and left out the salt because of all the broth I used. Because of dietary issues I also subbed a brick of softened low fat cream cheese for the cream. Saved on fat and the blood sugar problems of lactose. I garnished with a shredded queso and sliced avocado. Thanks for sharing! And tho the recipe didn't specify I did not drain my tomatoes when I added them.",
