It is not a heavily spiced or spicy dish. I prepared this dish exactly as written being very careful with accuracy in measuring. I followed the preparation as written. The chicken was very flavorful and moist. I did salt it slightly after browning it in the pan. The veggies added the right amount of crunch and sweetness. The flavor was subtle but I thought it was very flavorful. I cooked the noodles 5 minutes, and after assembling all the ingredients together, I brought the broth to a boil, then turned off the burner and let the noodle mixture sit for about 5 minutes. This let them absorb most of the liquid, which made them just the right consistency and the sauce thicker. This is the best chow mein recipe I have ever tasted. Thanks",

When making this don't over cook the noodles or you will end up with mush.  4 - 5 minutes is all they take.  Have everything chopped and prepped as this comes together really fast and there is no time to stop and measure or chop.",

Also used only 1 head bok choy, but upped to 1 whole small zucchini and added a little celery, 1/2 can water chestnuts and 1/2 can cut baby corn.  Very flexible.

I must say I modify the recipe by increasing the amount of garlic (8 cloves), add a good splash of oyster sauce to the chicken marinade and increase the amount of sesame oil and soy sauce. Those who have commented that it is flavorless can also try to considerably increase the amounts of sauces. Oh, and instead of 250 gr I put 500 gr of chicken. Simply delicious!! Good food must be made with generous hands, so don't stick too rigidly to the recipe!!",

I did make a couple changes that probably affected flavor some but I doubt they would have changed the overall flavor enough to make much of a difference. Instead of sesame oil I used canola oil plus a very generous amount of sesame seeds to get the sesame flavor. Instead of Oyster Sauce I used 2 T chicken broth 1/4 tsp white vinegar. To make it palatable I needed to add a lot more green onion soy sauce and garlic salt. This is probably a good base recipe. Will play with it to try to make it really good.",
