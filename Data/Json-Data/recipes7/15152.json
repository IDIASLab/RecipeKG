I was very curious about it and was so happy when I found this recipe. I made it several times and found that letting it sit for just a minute or two worked best for me. Any longer and the whey started to separate. It\u2019s a soft custard with a fairly strong ginger taste and a bit of sweetness . The ginger made my mouth and throat nice and warm.  I made it for several friends and they really enjoyed it.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It was a lot of fun trying something new! I will definitely be making it many times over.",
