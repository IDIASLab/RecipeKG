Kale is also really cheap (I spent 43 cents on it!) so I recommend it. I also omitted the sugar from the dressing and added extra garlic. It was a quick, easy recipe.

The sweetness of the roasted beets really worked with the saltiness of the cheese, and was balanced out perfectly with the slightly bitter/spicy flavor of the arugula.
