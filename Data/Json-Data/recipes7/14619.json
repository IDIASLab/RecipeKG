Also I used organic unflavored coconut oil in place of vegetable and added 1 banana and some chopped dates to the pecans.  To save time I used the microwave for the 1 sweet potato.  My oven has convection bake so it only took about 50 minutes at 350.  I was careful not to over mix the batter and used stone ground white whole wheat flour.  Will definitely make again!",

This is by far one of the delicious Pumpkin Breads that I made.   It is sweetened just right.  Not too sweet.  This will be the Pumpkin bread for future Fall recipes!",
