First I cooked the lamb cubes for 15 minutes rather than 25 minutes and that resulted in more of the meat being like pulled lamb rather than chunks of lamb. Second I only used 1 teaspoon of allspice thinking one Tablespoon was too much and I was glad I made that decision. We like plenty of thickened liquid in a stew so I used extra water and thickened with corn starch. I expect the pureed corn was for thickening but it really didn't do a thing.",
