Choose plastic bottles that were sold with carbonated drinks in them as my recycled milk bottle exploded. Having made this recipe four times now I leave the bottles on the side from day 8-14 and carefully unscrew the top to release the pressure every day. It is amazing how fizzy this drink gets. Don't try and reduce the sugar it really tastes better with the full amount as stated in the recipe. My guests have loved this and it is a great talking point.",

At this rate it might sit on my counter for another week dripping if I don't figure something else out. It smells good though:) Edit note: Added a star final product was delicious. Straining through coffee filter killed some of the carbonation so we pour it off into a glass careful not to disturb sediment. I used plastic water bottles and didn't lose a single one. I was sometimes letting air out 2x a day. Watch the bottles very carefully. The kids wouldn't drink it they said it smelled alcoholic and it did taste very mildly so. But I will be making it again.",
