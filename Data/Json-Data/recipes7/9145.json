I doubled the dressing and used dijon instead of honey mustard. Also 2 & 1/2 cups of uncooked pasta is basically one box. So be sure to double the dressing. We don't care for cauliflower so I just did 1 cup of chopped red pepper and 2 cups of cherry tomatoes. I let this sit overnight to let the flavors blend together. Overall it's very good and worth the effort especially when there's nothing left in the bowl - you know your guests enjoyed it!",

The first time I made this I followed directions exactly (except I used dijon mustard instead of honey). I was excited about the part where you cook basil with garlic and pour it on the pasta - it sounded brilliant. But I was disappointed when the flavor was lost in the sea of other items. I thought the salad was a little dry so the second time I skipped the cooking of the basil doubled the dressing and added 2 teaspoons of fresh basil directly to the dressing. It was the right amount but the salt and blue cheese were over-powering. I repeated this the third time but didn't double the salt and blue cheese. I did double the tomatoes and mozzarella and thought it was perfect. The combination of basil mozzarella and parmesan is magic... the blue cheese makes it even more interesting.",

Also had to use shredded mozzarella cheese and regular onion rather than green onion. I too used regular tomatoes but I took out the seeds and pith and just used the outer flesh diced into pieces the size of halved cherry tomatoes. Finally I would not double the dressing.

Had to double the dressing amount for that amount of dry pasta to get about 12 servings. I chose not to double the blue cheese but I will next time as we like blue cheese in our house. If you re not sure if your family or guests like the blue cheese don t double it. It still tastes great! By the way there was no need to double the tomatoes.",
