I will concur with the other reviewers who said this recipe makes WAY TOO MUCH frosting. I doubled the batch because it says it only makes 12 cupcakes but I actually ended up with close to 50 which I thought I was generously frosting until I was done and there was still a full two cups of frosting left!!! And I didn't double the frosting recipe! I also didn't have any orange extract so I put a dot of lemon extract in and it gave the frosting a nice citrusy flavor without being overpowering. I put an entire 20 oz can of crushed pineapple (which I drained but not very well) in the cake batter because I didn't feel like wasting it. I will make these again but maybe not so many!",

My daughter saw some beautiful carrot cupcakes w/cream cheese frosting at Trader Joe's and wanted to buy them; I told her we'd do better and make some instead! This recipe looked good and it was. I have never made carrot cake before and was unsure of the pineapple but it's great. I also thought the batter was really liquidy but I guess it's supposed to be that way. I got 15 cupcakes out of this. I reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour. I used 1% milk in the frosting not cream and it was fine. I made all of the frosting (used Neufchatel) and yes it is too much but I was expecting that because I read the reviews. I'm going to use the rest to frost some chocolate cookies. The frosting is really good; I added an extra ounce of white chocolate. Next time I would only do 3 cups of sugar- it's pretty sweet as-is. You can really taste the orange too but I like that. This recipe is really good and almost perfect (except for the sugar) so it gets 5 stars from me!",
