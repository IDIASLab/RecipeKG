I gave it only 4 stars because I made a bunch of changes - to make it a healthier dinner - I omitted the sour cream and butter and i left out the raisins (my kids don't like them). I added a third egg to ensure the mixture will hold together - very sweet and delicious! UPDATE: I made this for PASSOVER by substituting matzo farfel for the noodles! I used 1 package of farfel soaked it in warm water for about i minute drained it and then continued using the other healthier substitutions mentioned above.",
