Followed recipe as written but only pressure cooked for 10 mins.  I also let the pressure cooker come down on its own and DIDN'T quick release!!  Those were the most delicious and moist pork chops I've ever eaten!!  It is for sure a keeper!!  Cut down on cooking time because I didn't have carrots.  Cooked 5 chops.  If you like pork chops these were fall apart chops!!  Everyone should cook in a pressure cooker.  Everything is so much better and moist!!.   I just wish there were more recipes for pressure cookers on All Recipes!!",

I used home made chicken stock instead of the veg and used pork loin boneless chops that were one inch thick. I added about 1/4 cup of dry white wine and two huge cloves of garlic. I don't use baby carrots so I roughly chopped three very large carrots. I'm not a fan of potatoes in a pressure cooker so I served this with garlic and chive mashed potatoes.
