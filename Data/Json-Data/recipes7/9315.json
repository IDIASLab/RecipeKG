There are so many ways to change and add to it that any person in your family will love it. It also works well using strawberries and rhubarb together or any other berry you can think of instead of mulberries. The preserves may look runny or thin on the cupboard shelf, but once in the fridge they thicken up nicely.  Enjoy!",

This is a little thin, even after being in fridge, but perfect for us as we like to add on ice cream or pancakes. I never boil jars to seal them for any of my canning. I simply put the hot lids on jars (the jars I have already individually warmed up by running under hot water) twist the lids on and done. They always seal nicely and have long shelf life. \n\nThanks for the recipe!",
