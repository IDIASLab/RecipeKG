I also did not use all of the whole eggs, rather I changed it to half whole eggs and only using the egg yolks of the other half so the recipe would read: 2 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs. I also changed the whole milk to 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 whole milk. A little bit of Vanilla Bean was used too.  The custards browned up in the appropriate time frame, maybe 5 minutes more was needed. I was using a convection oven at 325*. I also used a water bath so the custards did not brown too quickly.   One mistake is overcooking a custard. Once a custard is set, pull it out and let it rest for 10 minutes then refrigerate. A custard will jiggle like jello when it is set. Angle the custard to the side and stick a toothpick in it, if it seeps out it is NOT done. If the toothpick comes out clean and there is no custard seeping out it is done. ",
