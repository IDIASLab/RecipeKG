I just inhaled three in less than 5 minutes lol I had an extra box of frozen puff pastry sheets from a savory recipe that I made a week ago and I was craving something sweet. Thank goodness I stumbled across this recipe. I added some brown sugar to the cinnamon sugar mix because I like the stickiness that it adds to baked goods and excluded the cardamom simply because I didn't have any handy. I also sliced the roll using string because I couldn't imagine murdering that delicate pastry dough with a knife lol I had to distract myself during the cooling time or else I would have just snatched them up right off of the baking sheet because they smelled AMAZING. I'm definitely keeping puff pastry in my freezer at all times now for this amazing recipe. Thanks for changing my life haha",
