I cut the recipe in half and used a round cake pan lowered the sugar a little and felt it turned out great. Not overly sweet or tart. There seemed to be a little more crust/topping than custard so next time I would like to lessen that and/or maybe increase the custard (but it barely fit in the 9\" pan). It seems it would be great with a little flaked coconut in either the crust or the custard. Great recipe for little work. Really glad I found this. Thanks kittymom for sharing.",
