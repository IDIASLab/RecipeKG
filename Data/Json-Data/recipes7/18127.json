I think I was doing it wrong perhaps even eating undercooked chicken because I thought that's just how it is. This method works perfectly. I used the 50 minute cooking time and they had actually crispy skin and were both moist and entirely cooked through. You may use significantly less butter to make this but may have to make up the liquid with and extra 1/2 cup or so of stock. I used about 3 tbsps of butter. I didn't notice the missing 5 tbsps at all. Thanks for this recipe--I didn't just learn a new recipe but a better technique that feels like an accomplishment.",
