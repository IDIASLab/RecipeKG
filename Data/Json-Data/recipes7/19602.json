It's not really a cake but more like bars which is how I cut them. While the crumb topping disappeared into the cake the middle became an ooey gooey sticky extra sweet layer. If I ever make it again I would cut the sugar in half. Thanks for the recipe.",

Poured the batter over it and sprinkled the rest of the cinnamon-sugar mix on top. Mixed up the streusel and sprinkled it on. Put it in preheated oven and checked after 35 minutes. Toothpick covered in batter. Checked after 40 minutes and still batter in center. After 45 minutes the edges were looking dry so I took it out and let it cool. What I had was a gooey mess in the middle (that tasted like Snickerdoodles) and a rock hard layer of cinnamon and sugar glued to the bottom of my pan that couldn't be scraped off. I almost threw the pan out but after soaking it for 2 days and lots of scraping I have my pan back. I would try this again if anyone has any ideas why this was such a disaster. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",
