She passed the recipe on to my mom who has been making them since before I was born, always around Thanksgiving time. My husband jokes that this was one of the reasons he fell in love with me - he looked forward to going to my parent's for Thanksgiving each year and being able to bring a pie home! Nowadays I make them myself for him and my sons and everyone loves them. The lemon and allspice helps it stand out from the other sweet potato pies I've had. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",
