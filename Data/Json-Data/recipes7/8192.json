I halved it and followed the directions exactly with all of the right ingredients except I lacked on the sliced pork loin because my local deli stopped selling it. I think next time I will increase the amount of mayo and decrease the ground chipotle peppers and cumin in the chipotle mayo sauce. Other than that the sandwich was delicious and the chipotle mayonnaise was very creative and different which can be good sometimes! :)",
