The guests all seemed to really enjoy these and they were very easy to make. Thank you.",

I had just bought a bottle of rose water on a whim having no idea what to do with it and then I happened to come across your recipe referenced on a Passover dessert blog (no flour!). I folded in a couple of handfulls of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I ended up with 15 quite large cookies would have made them smaller but I was too lazy to take out a second cookie sheet. they are lovely yummy sophisticated and different. Thank you SO much for this recipe!",
