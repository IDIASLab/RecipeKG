I have made this several times, each time trying to make adjustments to keep it from being so buttery.  Final tweaks to the dough:  1 1/2 cup flour (instead of 1 1/3 cup), 1/4 tsp salt (instead of a pinch), 1/4 cup sugar (if you want it a little sweeter), 1 egg (instead of 1 egg yolk), and NO water.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour in the plastic wrap.  Tweaks to the frangipane:  add 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and toast the almonds before grinding.  Roll out the pastry dough, fit into the pan, then refrigerate 30 minutes.  Add the frangipane, then the apples (use small apples - makes fitting them in the pan MUCH easier), then refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Bake on the oven rack, not on a baking sheet.  Perfection!  Thanks for the recipe!",

As the recipe states, it needs to be chilled - otherwise the fats in the crust sweat a little, making it greasy. I actually let the pastry (in the pie tins) chill in the freezer while I prepare the apples and frangipane. \n\nAs for the frangipane, I substituted the apple brandy with amaretto (Disorono to be specific). It gave it a much more almondy taste (which some reviewers commented was missing) with the special richness that only liquor can give =). Substituting with almond extract, I feel would not be as interesting (though I haven't tried it). As per other reviewers, toasting the almonds before combining in the frangipane is a must! Great recipe - turned out beautiful and was extremely impressive! Love it!",

I also didn't happen to have any apple brandy on hand but I did have some Orgeat (almond syrup) to use instead. For the topping I didn't have the apricot jam and instead used orange marmalade mixed with a couple of TBSP of the orgeat to brush on the top. Also used raw sugar to sprinkle on top instead of regular white sugar. This was a huge hit with everyone in my family and guests. Wonderful recipe and easy dough to work with.",
