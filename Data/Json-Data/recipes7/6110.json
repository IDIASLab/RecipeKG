The first time I used sticky rice and cooked it on a splatter guard on top of pan of water about three inches from rice and placed a stainless steal bowl over the rice. I turned the rice once during cooking. It turned perfect. The second time some of the rice cooked and some didn't and after two hour I just chucked it and made long grain rice. It was ok but I didn't really like it after having the sticky rice. I am going to try the micro wave and if that doesn't work I am going to buy a steamer. 1/2 cup sugar in the coconut milk and it was more than sweet. The second time I used Agave' sugar and it wasn't as sweet. The flavor was there but need to add more next time. You can also use tapioca starch in place of corn starch which I did. I also used 1/2 cups rice and i/2 cups coconut milk. I live in Australia and there are no Mangos at this time of year so I used canned ones. I preferred them and it was a lot cheaper. ( I really miss the great food in the US) You really can use any kind of fruit you like. This is really one of the best recipes I have tried on the site and 8 of my friends who I served it to agreed.",

When we have a lot of leftover sticky rice at the temple we make this for breakfast. \nNot sure the cornstarch is necessary since sticky rice is very glutenous. To be authentic palm sugar should be used, and it cuts down on the sweetness some reviewers complained about. \nThais usually use coconut cream since a lot of milk can be made from a little cream, then add some leftover cream to sweetened condensed milk and a little butter to make a drizzle to go over the final plate if you like it sweeter. Laos often substitute pineapple for mangoes where I live.  I have also made this will cinnamon.",
