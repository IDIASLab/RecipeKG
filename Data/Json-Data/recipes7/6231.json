Use the best chocolate you like for the best results.\n\nFor those that cannot get it to set or that the texture is grainy.  The solution is get richer cream and different chocolate.  The cream is the one that prevents the setting.  heavy cream is in the 30% fat range.  That is the requirement.  You can try whipping cream BUT some have added sugars.  The organic types usually do not.  So do not skimp, use the good cream.  As for the graininess this is usually the chocolate.  It could be too old or simply of a lower quality.  Again this is a high end desert, not chocolate pudding.  Pay a few dollars a bar for 70%+ cocoa content.  If you find it too bitter add more sugar the intensity of the chocolate is what you are looking for.  Hope I helped.",

It's funny 2 different people at my party described it as \"See's candy truffle in a dish.\" This was said at two different times by two different people. This is a very rich thick grown up pudding.

I read the reviews and considering I won't attempt any dessert unless it receives a majority of rave reviews because I don't want to waste my time making something that's just okay, I am thoroughly impressed. Chef John knows his Pot de Creme. \n\nFollowed recipe exactly. Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. Tried first serving (husband and I split it) after 4.5 hours of set time. It was terrific and I thought it was set enough.  Just ate a whole one on my own after it set in the fridge for 20 hours and it was the best Pot De Creme I've ever had, upscale restaurants and bakeries included! The consistency was dreamy - so pretty - and the flavor perfection. This was completely unadorned too, no whipped cream or garnish. Cannot wait to makes these for friends coming over for holiday wine and dessert next week! Thank you, Chef John!",

I can't wait to try some variations like orange zest fresh raspberries etc. I served it with the recommended lightly whipped cream and chocolate shavings along with homemade chocolate biscotti that we used as spoons - YUM! Word of warning though: as written this recipe definitely makes 4 servings - I split it between two small dessert bowls instead of four espresso cups and it was waaaaay too much to eat in one sitting. I would also strongly recommend that you use really good quality chocolate. When a recipe has only a few ingredients it is absolutely essential that you don't skimp when stocking them or the finished product isn't going to be as good.",
