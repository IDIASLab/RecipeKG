The mother of 6 children, lovingly raising the future of the world, loving my Grandfather and supporting our freedom. She would move their children and worldly possessions to be as close to my Grandfather as they could be, whenever and wherever the Navy needed Grandpop. Eventually they settled in NJ, known far and wide for its awesome produce, especially its blueberries. It just reminds me Of Mom and Grandmom's love and devotion to their families. Scoop a biscuit into a bowl and spoon blueberry sauce over biscuit, top with the chilled vanilla pudding, and oh my! Enjoy! Heaven on earth!",
