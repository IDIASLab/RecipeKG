I made it a second time and took out 6Tbs of the 1c of milk and added lemon juice in its place.  I also used 1c of whole wheat flour & 2c all purpose and reduced the sugar to just under 2 cups.

The glaze at the end was not soaking in so I carefully poked the sides of the loaf with a fork and swirled the juice around.  I had a surplus of lemons and not a lot of butter so this recipe was a good match.  Will definitely make again but with a bit less sugar.  Bonus: my husband also found this cake delicious.",
