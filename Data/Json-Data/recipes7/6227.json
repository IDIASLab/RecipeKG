If you don't like a super-saucy wing (like my husband) they're perfect just like that. If you love extra sauce go crazy on top of that baked in flavor once they're done. Will definitely be making again. These aren't super-spicy as written but like the directions say it's easy to tweak the spiciness to your liking.",
