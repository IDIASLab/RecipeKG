Unfortunately, instead of adding 1/4 teaspoon of water I added 3 tablespoons because the powdered sugar was taking over the recipe, it was too much for the quantity of water, so I recommend adding 3 tablespoons of water instead of 1/4 teaspoon, after I was done the frosting was HEAVEN on my cake!

I didn't have dairy free margarine so I used coconut oil. 6 tbs wasn't nearly enough so I ended up adding quite a bit of liquid (used oat milk instead of water). Instead of vanilla I used dehydrated raspberry powder (added with the powdered sugar) and raspberry extract. Whipped it for 5 minutes in my kitchen-aid. It is AMAZING. Thank you for this recipe! Piped it onto cupcakes.",

I used Earth Balance Original margarine and found that there was an aftertaste to the frosting even after I d added the banana extract which was pretty powerful.

It also made the frosting have a stiff consistency while still being light and creamy. Definitely something I d recommend doing if you try this one.",
