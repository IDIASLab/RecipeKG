It's a yummy alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. This cake is good as is, or sprinkled with powdered sugar. It is especially tasty with a good glaze drizzled on top. The glaze that my family likes best is made with cream cheese and a little bit of rum.",

                "reviewBody": "I feel bad to be rating a recipe so low but there are some pretty big problems with this one. First please be aware that the recipe calls for self-rising flour not all-purpose. I did not notice this until after mixing it all together and realizing there was no baking powder or baking soda in the recipe! I managed to mix in a tsp. of baking powder at the end before baking but ideally it should be added with the dry ingredients. I believe 3 cups of pumpkin puree is too much. All I had on hand was a 15 oz. can and it was plenty. Also there is no baking time indicated! It just says to bake it till done. I baked mine till a toothpick came out clean (approx. 55-60 min.) but the texture towards the middle of the cake was a little too dense and almost undercooked so I think it could have used a bit more time in the oven or maybe that is just the texture of this cake. I really wanted to like it for a Fall recipe but it needs some fine tuning.",

I used cooked, mashed sweet potatoes in place of the pumpkin because they were $.25 a pound today. Laced the cake with 2 Tb of rum and added 2 tsp ginger. How to make your own self rising flour: Measure 2 cups all purpose flour and in a bowl. Remove 1 tablespoon (either discard that Tb or return it back to the flour bag.) To the remaining scant 2 cups of flour, add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Mix together with a whisk. Voila! Your own self rising flour. Baking took 75 minutes in my recently calibrated oven to get a clean toothpick with only a few, tiny crumbs clinging. Made the glaze with 1 Tb Tortuga Gold rum and replaced the milk  with orange juice, adding a half tsp freshly grated orange zest. The orange imparted subtle counterpoint to the spices and gave a fresh, bright taste. This cake bakes up nice and high for a stunning presentation. It's an impressive cake for important events, like big holiday parties or family gatherings. Your baking skills will be impossible to deny if you make this one. It's a show-stopper for sure, and as super moist and delectable as it was beautiful to look at. Thank you for an outstanding holiday recipe!",

I like recipes specifically for my Bundt cake pan because a little dusting of powdered sugar dusting will do when you want to cut back on calories or just lighten it up.  The glaze is delicious if you want to go all the way.  This is now a permanent part of my holiday recipe collection because it is so easy to take to the bake sale or holiday dinner.  When I take this cake out I make sure to substitute orange extract, dried or fresh orange peel, OR vanilla extract for the rum.",

If the cake is as good as the glaze I will be sure and remember to try that too.  This glaze is perfect and awesome good! The measurements are right on, the consistency is perfect and the rum extract is a creative and brilliant addition for a pumpkin cake.  In addition to being delicious it's a beautiful glaze too, lusciously thick and glossy.  I'll definitely keep this glaze in mind for other cakes in the future too, varying flavors as the cake would dictate.  Excellent.",
