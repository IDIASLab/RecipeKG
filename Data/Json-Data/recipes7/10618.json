Also for extra crunch if I have them I shred radishes into the slaw. Great recipe as is I really hate to tweet someone's recipe. One more thing, I don't use a box shredder. Use a knife and slice and chop as thin as possible. The slaw won't get as soggy, and will last another day without being to wet.",
