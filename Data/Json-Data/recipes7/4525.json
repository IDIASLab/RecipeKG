I used Nestle cocoa powder and Ghiradelli chocolate. I used my aerolatte milk frother to mix to the chocolate and whipped cream together which I highly recommend using if you have one. It makes it extra creamy and frothy. I can't wait to make this next month when my family is in town for Christmas. You can reserve a small amount of the whipped cream for the top if you wish. Keep in mind this is a very rich hot chocolate. You can refrigerate leftovers and simply re-heat on the stove or microwave.",
