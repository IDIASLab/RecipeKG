I did everything exactly as stated in the recipe except the order of the dry ingredients.  I put the sugar and salt in before the flour because that's just how my other breadmaker's recipes have it.  It probably doesn't even make a difference.  Afterwards, I dipped the doughnuts in a glaze I found in a review of another recipe.  It's 1/4 cup milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 cups powdered sugar.  Yummmmm....\nUPDATE-----I just made these for a second time and they were SOOO much better!  Make sure the wet ingredients (butter, milk, egg) are room temp or sligtly warmer.  I placed the egg and the milk (in a cup) in a big bowl of warm/hot water to speed things up. Also, I turned up the temp on the deep fryer.  It seemed the hotter, the better.  Last time the taste was very similar to funnel cakes you get at the fair.  This time they DEFINITELY tasted like doughnuts.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!",

The second time I used bread flour and put the salt in the flour because I used bread machine yeast and read on the lable not to let yeast come in contact with salt.  My dough did great the second time.  I also put it in my propane oven with a standing pilot so it would stay warm.  First time making doughnuts and they turned out great.  I used a doughnut glaze that I found on recipezaar.  My family loved these.  Next time I will try using a biscuit cutter and filling the center with jelly.  Good recipe",

I recently saw another doughnut recipe that was very similar ingredient wise. Using advise from there and only a slight change in ingredients I got very good results. First melt the butter combine it with milk sugar and egg make sure this mixture is warm but not to warm. Add this mixture to bread maker mix salt with flour add to maker. Put yeast on top. I ended up adding an extra 1/8-1/4 cup of flour while the dough was kneading as the dough was way to soft other wise. The other recipe was a refrigerator recipe so you may be able to yet away with the soft dough if refrigerating but the extra flour is a must if you are not. I just made a batch last night I doubled the recipe cooked a third of the dough right away and refrigerated the rest and cooked this morning. To refrigerate add a little oil to a glass bowl roll the dough in the oil to coat cover and refrigerate. Last nights doughnuts where good much better then previous efforts with this recipe. this mornings were great. With this mornings I took the extra step of letting an oven heat up a bit then adding a pan of hot water to help hold the temp and letting them rise in there. It may account for the difference in quality between last nights and this mornings.",
