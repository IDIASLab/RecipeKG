I like the toasted almond flavor more than the carmelized sugar flavor. I can't keep out of them as they cool either! They are DELICIOUS on salads - especially paired with my sweet sour salad dressing. I'm in the midwest and we have a restaurant called Max & Erma's that has an AMAZING house salad. It's served with bacon red onion sweet sour dressing and toasted almonds. I posted the almond and sweet sour salad dressing recipes so I could easily find them!",

I started the sugar first and when it started getting some color added the almonds. Right after I dumped them on a sheet pan I threw a little turbinado sugar on them. Made them all fancy looking. I bet fancy salt would be fun too. I will try spices next. I think cayenne would be interestng or good chili powder.",
