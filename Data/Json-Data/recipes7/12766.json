These do not brown on the edges, but when cooled, you will notice the light golden brown underneath. This is a delicate flavor cookie, not sugary sweet. The sweetness will come from the icing that you choose to use; confectioners' sugar mixed with milk is your best bet.",

I read the intro to the recipe that said the sweetness comes from the icing or topping made for these. I am not big on frosting so I made a lemon whipped cream topping. If it wasn't for that topping I am not sure how well these would have went over. I made 1/3 of the recipe and got 30 cookies with a cookie scoop. I was looking for a simple dessert recipe for Easter without a lot of fuss. That worked fine for this. I just flattened the balls to make roundish shapes. I may have to try a Lofthouse cookie at the store to see if this really is supposed to be like little mini sweet like biscuits. I would love to see how others fare with this recipe or what they use as a topping or sweetener.",

                "reviewBody": "The cookies are delicious and look fantastic. All you need is a good frosting recipe. It's very difficult to work with the dough. You definitely have to chill it overnight. I placed a few cups of the dough on Saran Wrap and rolled it so that it looked like the refrigerator cookie dough tubes you buy at the store. I thought that would make it easier to work with the dough the next day. I won't bother with that next time. The dough was still very sticky and wet. I placed the cookie dough on a well floured surface and then made sure that I had flour on my rolling pin and hands. Just lightly roll it out and dip your cookie cutter in flour and place on the pan. These rise a lot but they don't spread much if cut with a cookie cutter. I rolled them 1/4 inch and they fluffed up like the store cookies. If these cookies did not taste fantastic and look amazing I would never make this sticky gloppy annoying dough recipe again! The key is patience flour to dust the surface lightly roll the dough & just work with a little bit at a time; keep the extra dough in the fridge.",
