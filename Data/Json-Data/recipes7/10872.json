I used a little less sugar and butter than the recipe called for, and I didn't miss it a bit.  To make this recipe even easier, I recommend checking your grocery store for Pillsbury's Crescent Recipe Creations.  It's a seamless dough sheet that just gets rolled out right into your 9x13 pan. I will definitely be making this again!",

I used a metal pan and the only change I made was to cook it for one hour plus fifteen minutes. Next time I will use a scant bit less sugar in the cream cheese, 3/4 cup, just because i like things a little less sweet. This was awesome with a cup of coffee and would be divine with ice cream, thanks again! I will be trying this with peach and with blackberry fillings as well. Just wanted to add another note...this is two months later and I have made this with various fillings, Apple is very good and Blackberry was the very best! I have cut the sugar in the cheese back to 1/2 cup. White cake mix is good as well. Thanks so much for a new favorite pantry recipe!",

It would be really good with a lot less sugar. You don't need the brown sugar either! I only used 1 tsp. of cinnamon because hubby doesn't like a lot.....but 2 tsp. as called for would have been fine! Otherwise it was easy and quick but a bit expensive when you figure out the cost of cherry pie filling 2 pkgs. of cream cheese and cake mix not to mention the butter!",
