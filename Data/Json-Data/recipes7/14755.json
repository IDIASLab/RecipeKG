I had to add almost 1 and 3/4 cups extra flour due to it being too oily and to form a dough. But yet was still too oily. After all the adjustments the cooking process was fine and it tasted good. I also had to add more sugar to the syrup as it was not thick enough to hold onto the pastry.\n\nPlease adjust your recipe as it was very difficult to adjust.",
