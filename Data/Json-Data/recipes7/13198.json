There seemed to be a bean taste to the end product, so next time I'll leave that out. I only used 1 tsp of xanthan gum. The cookies held together perfectly. The only issue was how thick the batter was. On one of the loaves I left it as is, on the other, I ended up adding a bit of vin santo (keeping with Italian tradition) to help out and found this helped fold in the nuts better. All-in-all this is a definite keeper recipe. Times and temperatures were right on. I'll just leave out the garbanzo flour next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
