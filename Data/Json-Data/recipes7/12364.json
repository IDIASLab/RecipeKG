I have never made vegan cookies before, but decided to try these out since we were invited to a game night at a vegan friend's house and I wanted to bring something. Surprisingly, I ended up absolutely loving these so much that I want to make them for all occasions now! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did substitute almond milk for soy milk and coconut oil for canola oil because those were what I had. I did not have walnuts and realized that my chocolate chips were not vegan, so I left both of those out too. I was afraid the cookies would turn out too bland but they were perfect!",
