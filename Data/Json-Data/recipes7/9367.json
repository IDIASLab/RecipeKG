Firstly I added 2 Tbsp milk along with my vanilla & the added 2 tsp of Peppermint Extract to give these cookies a bit more flavor. For those who are finding this recipe to be a bit crumbly I'd recommend adding the 2 Tbsp of Milk as the milk will make the dough softer and easier to push though your cookie Press. As a general rule you want your dough to be soft but still somewhat firm so that the shapes will come out properly when pressed. Overall great recipe & very flavorful with the peppermint added.",
