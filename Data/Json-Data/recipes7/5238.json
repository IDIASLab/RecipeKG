Once it was prepared (exactly as written, w/ the minor exception of more green bell pepper than red), I was disappointed to find that it tasted like a vinegar-ey, sugar-ey hamburger stir-fry. My husband gave it a 4 (although he stuffed his servings into a warmed tortilla w/ salsa and cheese), my 3-year old wouldn't touch it, and I gave it a 1, so we'll settle for 2 stars. Perhaps w/ some substantial changes that would either turn it into more of an actual stir-fry, or into a Cottage Pie, I would've enjoyed it more, but as written, I just couldn't shake the over-powering taste of vinegar and sugar. Thanks for giving me a chance to try something new though!",
