The strawberries turned out super delicious with a nice looking glaze from the melted sugar - like strawberries on a store bought pre-made cake. Used cool whip and they went great together. I was worried that I needed to make a strawberry spread as well to layer with the cool whip but it was plenty sweet with the cool whip and sugary strawberries so there was no need. Plus once I put the strawberries on the cool whip some of the juice melted into the cool whip anyway made it even more delicious. Also did this with raspberries and they turned out just as delicious. Very quick and easy plus it looks pretty so guests will be impressed. Thanks for the recipe!",
