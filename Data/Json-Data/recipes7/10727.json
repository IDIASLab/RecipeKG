The eggs were too sweet for my taste and I don't care for the clove and bay leaf in the pickling marinade but you could make this with any beet-pickled egg recipe. If you plan to make deviled eggs from your pickled eggs don't pickle the eggs too long as the yolks get harder to work with. They also pick up more of the purple color making the filling pink rather than yellow. I did half plain eggs and half purple which worked out well and made a nice presentation. Next time I would try for a creamier filling by using a food processor to break down the relish and yolks a bit more.",
