I used tamari instead of soy sauce (less salty)  I could only find broccoli sprouts in the store.  I made my own curry powder from scratch (Sri Lankan style) Instead of 1 cup of sugar, I omitted it and instead added 1 Tablespoon of palm sugar.  This is similar to other Thai curry recipes I've made.  I mixed everything together in a big bowl and this will be my lunch for the week.  It is actually quite good but could use a little more heat. I think  all that sugar would ruin it.",
