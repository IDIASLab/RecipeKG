I heated the cream/sugar/salt over a double boiler until hot, but not boiling.  I tempered the eggs as stated in the recipe  before adding them to the cream mixture.  Once I added the egg mixture, I heated again until hot, but not boiling - then strained into a bowl with a pour spout.  I used the water bath as suggested, but did not cover them with the foil.  I baked for about 45 minutes, as my ramekins were not the short, wide ones - but the narrower, taller ones (I got 5 out of this recipe).  I cooled them for about 10 minutes before refrigerating them. I also brought them to room temp (about 40 minutes) before carmelizing the  top.  I used the broiler, but I think I will invest in a kitchen torch for the next time, as it made the mixture too hot, and I didn't have time to cool them again before serving.  The taste was WONDERFUL!",

The amount of sugar in the recipe was too much for our ramekins, ours did not have that much surface area.  I would recommend only using enough sugar to just coat the top.",

I've made this at least 5 times now and every time it gets gobbled up even if I botch it somehow I almost scrambled the eggs once and another time I spilled water into it when filling up the water bath and it still got eaten! One thing I always do is double the recipe you will need to do this if you're serving more than 3 people. I also add a couple of tablespoons of milk to the chocolate so it will spread easier then I stick it in the freezer until the creme brulee is ready. I find adding one extra egg yolk (to the doubled recipe) gives extra flavor. Make the creme brulee one day before but caramelize/torch the sugar just before you serve it. It's really good when it's just below room temp.",

It's best served right after the 4-6 hours of chilling, otherwise the chocolate becomes too hard. But you can also add a little milk to the chocolate to help keep it softer. Instead of white sugar, I use raw sugar, ground powdery fine using a food processor or blender, and only use enough sugar to nicely coat the entire top. Then use a kitchen torch in quick, circular or back-and-forth motions, moving to a different area as the sugar starts to melt  to keep from burning it. Depending on the group I'm serving, the process of caramelizing can also be part of the entertainment for the evening! I've tried some other recipes, but this one is my favorite.",
