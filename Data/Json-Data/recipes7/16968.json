They are quick and easy to make with only 4 ingredients and taste delicious. Try one to make sure it is baked all the way through, as it can be hard to tell. In Germany they are baked on backoblaten, little round wafers (there are gluten-free ones), but you can bake them directly on parchment paper as well. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.",

The bigger ones are 2 1/2 teaspoon heaps slightly spread.   The little ones are just a single teaspoon heap ... the plan is to squish them together and make macaroon-like cookies.",
