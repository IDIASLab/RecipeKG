Yes it is quick and easy but even after sitting in the fridge overnight it s soupy; soupy enough that you can drink it. I was interested in trying this recipe partly because of the Earl Grey tea (my favorite tea) but also because of its nutritional breakdown. I used the smallest dessert dishes that I had and ended up with 2 servings so if this still interests you you ll have to double the nutritional breakdown. You only use 1 cup of almond milk so that would equate to about 2 oz per person for four servings. Is that really a serving??? Sorry for the less than favorable review but although the flavor wasn t too bad I wasn t expecting a drinkable pudding.",
