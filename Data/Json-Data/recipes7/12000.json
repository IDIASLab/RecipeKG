I used canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon (family's preference). We omitted the frosting since we thought it was sweet and delicious enough without it. I did have some issues with the dough. It is important to note that I used a gluten free flour instead of regular. Usually my blend converts to wheat flour recipes pretty well but my dough problems are likely related to my flour. My dough was so soft that I couldn't work it. I wound up letting it rise laying it out refrigerating it to get it to roll then cutting it and letting it rise extra long before baking. But it came out fab none-the-less.",

I also let dough rise about 3 hours the first time and 2 hours after I made it into rolls but I'm sure it didn't need that long I just got busy.
