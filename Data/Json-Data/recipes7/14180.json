I love these and make them for family brunches all the time. They even taste good as leftovers, as pancakes again, or with peanut butter instead. We serve these with just syrup and butter, but many use lingonberries, or other fruit or jams.",

The pan needs to be buttered between each pancake to facilitate easy flipping, they are very delicate, I used 1/3 cup measure but it ripped easily would recommend 1/2 cup measure. Served with strawberry jam and cinnamon sugar, my sons enjoyed them. Yielded 10 pancakes with 1/3 cup measure.",
