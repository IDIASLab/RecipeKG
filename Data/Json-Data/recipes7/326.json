I admit I was rather dubious about the large quantity of spices (note for the reviewer who gave 1 star a stick of cinnamon is usually 2-3 inches long) but it came out great. I was short on star anise so I added a tsp of five spice powder and I also added the grated zest of an orange to the marinade and used beef broth instead of water. Everyone raved!
