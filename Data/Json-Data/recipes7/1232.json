The next night, I added another half jalapeno to the mixes...a bit more spice.\n\n2007 update - I made these again, but instead of frying them in oil, I baked them for @ 15 minutes at 375. Turned them over and baked for 5 more minutes. Still very yummy, but a bit better for us.",

I added an overflowing tablespoon of canned cranberry sauce to the mix for a better body and color.  I also baked these at 375 for about 15 minutes in my convection oven, spraying the tops with olive oil spray.  I never fry wontons - too much fat.  They were very crispy and good!  Thanks for a great way to use up both cranberries and jalapenos! ",
