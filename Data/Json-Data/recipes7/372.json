I used frozen blackberries just barely thawed so that when I tossed them in the mixture they wouldn't get mashed up. I also added 2 tbsp. of flour (extra) so that it wouldn't be runny.  I highly recommend using the No Roll Pie Crust II (use 2xs for a top and bottom pie crust) and also let the pie COMPLETELY cool before cutting.  Other than that, it was pretty good.",

I was shocked and confused to come back and read all the positive reviews. First off when making it I was anxious about the amount of sugar in the filling. I've never seen that much before. So when I tossed the filling ingredients together in the bowl the sugar was so heavy that the berries just sat on top of it no matter how much I tossed. The they wouldn't blend together. But I pressed on and made it the way your recipe stated. I dumped the ingredients into my pie crust as they were topped it and baked it. When I cut the pie open for the crowd all of the sugar was in one big white \"hill\" in the center of the pie! While baking it hardened there and everyone had huge chunks of pure hard white sugar in their piece of pie. It seems to me that there was no liquid for the sugar to melt down and dissolve with! I have never seen that happen before! Now my only guess is that it's because I used frozen berries instead of \"fresh\" because that's the ONLY thing I changed in your recipe. But every time I've done that with any other recipe has always worked out just fine (blueberries strawberries peaches etc...). So I don't know what went wrong but my crowd was very gracious and the pie disappeared quickly anyway. But wow was I ever disappointed and embarrassed. I would not make this recipe again.",
