You want to use Salt Beef or Salt Pork riblets (they are brine cured and can be purchased in pails).  Corned beef is a completely different product, with spices and a different taste.  Allrecipes changed the recipe when I submitted it, they probably thought it was the same thing and it isn't.  Also, it's probably best to keep the potatoes whole, or halved of they're large otherwise they'll end up boiling away to nothing.  Happy eating!",

Fill jar about 1 third to 1 half full.(The more people that you are cooking for the bigger the mason jar) Poke about 8-10 holes in the lid with a sharp knife. ( be very careful when doing this and remember to keep the lid so you will only have to do this once) Tie a string around the bottle just under the lid and tie the other end to the handle of your pot for easy removal. After it has boiled with the  meat and it is time to start adding vegtables, carefully take the bottle out of the water and let sit until veggies are almost cooked. before removing lid drain off any excess water through the holes in the lid, then just dump peas into bowl and season with butter and pepper. Clean up is so much easier, just rinse jar and put in dishwasher or clean with warm soapy water and a bottle brush.",
