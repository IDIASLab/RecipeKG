I combined all the wet ingredients together in a medium sized bowl (including the butter, which I did melt) and then all the dry ingredients in a seperate bowl. I tossed the raisins and chopped nuts into the dry ingredients before I folded the dry ingredients into the wet to prevent the raisins/nuts from sinking to the bottom of the muffin cups and also overmixing. I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and substituted pecans for walnuts. Before folding the raisins in, I soaked them in hot apple juice for 20 minutes. I did make muffins out of this recipe, I got 12 smallish muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at 20 minutes. These muffins turned out moist, delicious and perfectly sweet. NOTE: I did use a homemade (and very heavy on the seasonings) apple butter in this recipe which made any extra seasonings unnecessary.",
