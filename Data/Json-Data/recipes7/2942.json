A couple of things: made a lot more cookies than 24 (I used a 2t scoop and ended up with around 60) I baked them for the full 11 minutes and they were perfectly light and just a little chewy Used parchment paper instead of ungreased sheet Let them cool on the sheet before transferring to a wire rack since they were soft while they were still warm My husband said they taste like chewy gingersnaps I think they taste like cinnamon cake. Great recipe and a definate keeper!!",

Two things though and I'm not sure if this is common knowledge or not but I made half the cookies on flat 'air flow' baking sheets with no sides/edges and half of the batch with a regular baking sheet. The cookies seemed to really flatten out like pancakes on the air flow sheet but on the other baking sheet they were fine. As well I added a bit more cinnamon because I love the stuff but it really ended up being overpowering once they were done. Hope that helps any baking newbies out there!",

While I knew this would not appeal to me as I like my cookies crunchy I knew Hubs would like them - and he did. Neither of us could taste graham cracker flavor I of course knew it was in there but Hubs did not. In addition I found them a tad on the greasy side. A bag of cinnamon chips (roughly 2 cups) boosted the cinnamon flavor. As I do with all my cookie dough that begins with butter I gave it a stint in the fridge for an hour or so until it was semi-firm. So between the softness the somewhat greasiness and the fact the graham cracker flavor was barely apparent these were not my favorite cookie. Hubs on the other hand loved them so I ll use his rating of four stars.",

I chilled the dough then shaped it into a log on wax paper rolled it froze & sliced. Mine took longer to bake as expected with refrigeration & they were still chewy even with browned edges.
