I made this exactly as written but I think the bake time is about 10 minutes too long for a 13 x 9 pan. I was busy and didn't check the cake as it was baking so it baked the 45 minutes. I most definitely will try this again (and update my results) but I think it would have been done at about the 35 minute mark. The batter is very thick when you put it in the pan and is a thin layer. Next time I'm going to bake in an 11 x 7 pan.",
