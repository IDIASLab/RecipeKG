Although I m not convinced that you save any time using the Instant Pot the sauce was quite flavorful. My carrots were overcooked at 6 minutes even with releasing the pressure instantly (not waiting 5 minutes) but that could have something to do with not using baby carrots. If I were to use the Instant Pot again I d probably try 3-4 minutes. Very tasty but honestly I ll probably just steam the carrots in the microwave in the future which only takes about 2-3 minutes but most definitely will use the orange-ginger sauce in this recipe.",
