I don't have an oven proof pot so I placed the rice mixture in a 13x9 pan, arranged the chicken pieces on top, covered tightly with foil and baked for just under an hour.  (Brown rice takes a lot longer to cook than white.)  Smelled so good while it was baking, we couldn't wait to dig in.  We loved the wonderful blend of flavors in this chicken and rice dish!",

I used black olives instead of green as that's what I had on hand an did not include the capers as I was out. I also used 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of two due to the overwhelming media coverage on reducing sugar intake as of late (sigh). Overall easy and tasty. The 6 year old found it a bit spicy but she is catching on to our table flavors nicely and did manage to eat at least the chicken bits. The presentation is lovely; when you remove the lid at the table all of the chicken is nicely presented on top of the rice combination and smells just wonderful. Thanks Chef John!",

The green olives and capers give it an interesting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt. Cumin was the predominant flavor. If you don't like cumin cut back on it but I wouldn't eliminate it altogether. The chicken was done through but not overcooked. If you watch Chef John's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion. Some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for. And he does not include the back pieces of the chicken. I did because I like those bony parts. All-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating. We are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of us and it makes a lot.",
