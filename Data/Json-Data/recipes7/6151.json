I added a small box of vanilla pudding and for the glaze I used 1 cup of Hot Buttered Rum batter along with the rum and Boy Oh Boy was this YUMMY! I have left over batter so for dessert after dinner guess what I'm gonna do?? I even ate a piece with my morning coffee of Course! LOL This cake could not be more simple but not simple tasting by any means. Terrific flavor! MERRY CHRISTMAS BB:)",
