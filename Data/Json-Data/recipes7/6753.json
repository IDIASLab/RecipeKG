I found 2 cups whipping cream with 1 pkg instant pudding to be way too thick and did not provide an ample amount to frost 9x13, so used total of 4 cups whipping cream to 1 pkg instant French vanilla pudding. Got many compliments on the frosting, not too sweet since cake is sweet enough as is. Also the ratio of whipping cream made for a more \"milk\" flavor frosting that complimented the cake beautifully! Everyone thought frosting with buttercream would be way too sweet for this cake.",

I first made it when I was looking for a cake for my daughter's birthday. Having grown up on these I went in search for one. Needless to say the bakeries are charging an arm and a leg so I decided to try one myself. This recipe produces a cake that is perfect to decorate unlike traditional tres leches that are soggy and cant support layers or decorations. The filling is super simple to whip up and delicious. I've been covering it with a stabilized whipped cream frosting and then decorating. It has been a hit everytime.",

Adding extra ingredients to the cake mix does produce more batter and my layers baked over and dripped into the oven. I should have known better but went ahead with the directions as they were written. I used two 9 inch cake pans and would only fill them half full next time. I cut around the edges with a bread knife to remove the \"muffin top\" appearance and all was fine! I frosted mine with buttercream icing and that kept the mousse filling from oozing out. It was very helpful to freeze the layers a little for easier assembly. Bottom line is that this was a delicious cake!",
