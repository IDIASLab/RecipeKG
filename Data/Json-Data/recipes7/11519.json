A lassi is very similar to a smoothie, and I must admit that I love them.  I've tried many different smoothies and a few lassis on this site, and I think this is one of the easiest and the best, perhaps because of its simplicity.  It's just pure banana flavor with a little tang from the yogurt.  Very, very nice!",

After I tasted it, I found that no additional sugar was needed. My banana was quite small, so the lassi had a subtle banana taste which I think I enjoyed more, and a nice tang from the yogurts. Thanks for this delicious lassi recipe, Ivy!",

About 45 sec in my Nutribullet made a great tasting smoothly. Nice diet lunch on a hot summer day.",
