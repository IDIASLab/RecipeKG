Holly Baking use to make a brittle with these ingredients that was so good it was sinful. When they stopped making their cookies, I used the ingredients on their box to find this recipe.\nI think the almond would still be good to use, but the lemon doesn\u2019t taste good in this style of cookie imho.\nSo this is a wonderful basic recipes to add your own twist to, ie, chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, etc.",
