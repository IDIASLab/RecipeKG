I did follow the recipe exactly though used semi-sweet mini chocolate chips instead of the regular and the brownies disappeared within a matter of days at our house next time I might try dusting some powdered sugar very lightly on top these are sublime and to me taste extremely similar if not better than those of a local bakery called Breadworks that is known for its exquisite brownies now I can indulge at home as these are very inexpensive to make & amazing!!

Moist delicious and only a slight sink in the center. Notes - Allow melted butter to cool before adding the rest of the wetmix. Preheated oven to 400 then turned to 350 after putting in pan. Ovens drop temp quickly (50deg./10 sec.) with the door open. Do not open oven door while baking. Loss of heat pressure will cause collapse. -- Thanks for the recipe!",
