My problem has been getting the noodle consistency correc.t  First time I soaked for about an hour as instructed, and they were kind of crunchy but tasty.  Second time I kept the water warm on the stove (not boiling...below a simmer actually), and the noodles came out totally mushy.  Now I am soaking them in warm water (per package instructions) and checking them every 2 minutes until they seem right.  \n\nI suppose this depends on a lot of factors, like brand of vermicelli, water temp, etc. So I am not blaming the recipe for this.  Just a heads up to others, mostly. \n\nAs far as the recipe, I took away a star only because it is a bit time consuming.  But it is worth it, for sure.",

Used a box of rice stir fry noodles (intended for pad thai) and followed box directions to cook by adding to a pot of boiling water, remove from heat and let sit 10 minutes, then drain and rinse with cool water.  Let sit until ready to add in this dish with the seasoning.  The other tester's suggestion of fish sauce is also a good idea.  VERY GOOD!!",

I used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil & did not add salt. I loved it! I wanted to use peanut oil but had none and it was expensive at the store. Maybe next time!",
