But was frustrated that I didn't follow instructions so I made another batch this time following recipe and instructions to the letter. I also used a trick I do when I make Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I put a dish towel on the bottom of the roasting pan before I pour in the water bath. Well anyway the first batch was delicious but the second was outstanding!! It looked so perfect and when my daughter and her boyfriend came over the next day for lunch they were just amazed. Trust me just follow the recipe and the instructions and you will really enjoy this flan. Thank you for the recipe...",

It was wet, soft and for lack of a better word, mushy, and it sunk in the middle.  Also, the caramel that was released onto the plate was like water, not thick or syrupy.  One other thing that I didn't like was that I ended up with over 1/2 cup of the filling left after filling six 4-oz ramekins, and I hate wasting food!  I honestly do not know what went wrong here, I thought I'd followed this recipe to the letter, but it certainly did not live up to my expectations.  The one thing I can say is that it tastes good, although I couldn\u2019t taste even a hint of the coconut milk.  Granted, I haven\u2019t made many flans, so maybe this was human error somewhere along the way. I don\u2019t know, but I think I\u2019ll just move on.",
