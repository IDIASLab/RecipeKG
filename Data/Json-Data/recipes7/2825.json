We will absolutely be using this next year. I made some slight alterations. For the flour I used a 50/50 combination of whole wheat flour and bread flour. I mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately (after proofing the yeast and this made a very easy workable dough! Also made small slits on the top before baking so they had lovely cross ridges in the top. I topped them with royal icing so the crosses were predominant.",
