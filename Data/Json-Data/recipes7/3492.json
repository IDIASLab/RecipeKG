After setting in the refrigerator overnight I made a sandwich with a little catsup on it and it was soooo good. It did taste like meatloaf & although it still wasn't firm enough the next time I make it I am going to try adding a little extra bread crumbs or a few crushed saltines or maybe I just need to bake it a little longer.",

I didn't have celery so I left that out. I sauteed the onion (a vidalia) along with the carrot (used 2) the fresh garlic and some corn kernels. I blended the egg with a third or so of the tofu and about a third of the breadcrumbs in the food processor. I didn't want a perfectly blended texture so by blending a portion and then mixing the rest of the ingredients by hand I got a much more appetizing texture. When the blended portion was mixed with the remainder of the ingredients I stirred in the sauteed veggies and added a few hefty squirts of bbq sauce. The loaf baked for about 30 minutes then I topped it with the crushed tomatoes (left off the cheddar) and baked for 10-15 minutes more. Came out excellent. Ate it with rice and got 4 large servings. Making it again this week!",

                "reviewBody": "I've never given an review but felt compelled to this time since there was only one other. This meatloaf turned out more like a tofu-loaf than a firm loaf. After reading the only other review I tried adding extra breadcrumbs and I added some rolled oats (approx 1 cup) but it still didn't do much for the texture. I think the trick to this might be to forget the tofu and add something meaty like some chopped mushrooms and ground nuts. I also baked it about 20 mins. longer than called for. The taste was decent it wasn't terrible the ketchup I added to the top definitely helped. Hope someone else has better luck. I just think this recipe needs to be rewritten. No tofu more spices and more meaty stuff!!",
