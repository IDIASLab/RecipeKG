To save time I poached the pears while dinner was in the oven and just turned the burner off while we ate. Left the pears in the saucepan to stay warm transferred to a plate added apricot preserves to saucepan and then cornstarch. Once the sauce was thickened I transferred the pears back to the saucepan and took the whole thing to the table to flambe! It was beautiful and delicious served with vanilla bean ice cream. The sauce alone is fantastic drizzled over the vanilla ice cream as well (that was our dessert the next night)! Looks amazing and super complicated but ultimately a very simple and delicous dessert!",
