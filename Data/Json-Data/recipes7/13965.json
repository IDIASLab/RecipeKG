Instead of leaving the dough on the counter for 15 minutes I lined a bowl with parchment paper and put the dough in the bowl. This made it much easier to transfer the dough into the pot. Other than that I made this as written.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.",

Fantastic flavor.  I don't keep buttermilk on hand so substituted 1/4 cup soy milk with two tsp of cider vinegar added. Didn't proof yeast liquid - simply added everything to bowl.  Also after the 18 hour rise I used spatula to fold/stretch dough over itself in quarter turns of the bowl - then set on parchment paper in bowl with wrap to raise to shape for nearly an hour (including oven preheat time to 500 deg).  Gently lifted with parchment into hot dutch oven - cover and bake!  Baked a whole-wheat boule along side it, and even with pan of water on lower rack - crust was not as robust and delicious as this bread.",

Finally got a large enough Dutch oven to bake loaves in and this was perfect, wet and sticky as many people commented but it SHOULD be to get that steamed crust. \n\nI made 2....1/2 changes-- used thyme and garlic as I was out of carraway and did the 15 minute rest for 45 minutes IN the bowl. 1. My kitchen was too cold to just do a 15 minute rest and 2. I'm not willing to fight sticky doughs any more than I have to! A few folds in the bowl after the 18 hour rise was PLENTY to shape it and my bowl was big enough to rest it in (the sides could stretch and 'poof' freely). \n\nWould make again!",
