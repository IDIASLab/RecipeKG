I had trouble mixing the ingredients because there simply wasn't enough liquid - I ended up adding 8 cups of water just to get the ingredients to mix. I couldn't find fava beans in my area so I substituted butter beans. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice in the house so I made my own from nutmeg cinnamon ginger and clove making sure to use only 1 TBS of my spice mixture. I added double the chili powder. In the end the dish was terribly underflavored. Adding salt at the table helped but wasn't enough. Next time I make this I will quadruple the chili powder double the black pepper and add a bit of cayenne. I will also probably quadruple the amount of vegetable juice and add vegetable broth as well. Additionally I will add more spinach - we like spinach.",
