Instead I just dropped them onto a parchment lined cookie sheet using a tablespoon measure melon baller. Then I sprinkled them with the nonpareils(multi-colored sprinkles). I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect! These are a nice soft cookie with a slightly crunchy edge. Not too sweet which is how I like my cookies! And they did taste great with a glass of champagne! This is a good way to use up leftover champagne! I added a few photos!",
