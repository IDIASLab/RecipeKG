I had a hard time getting the dough into a ball to be able to roll it out, then it fell apart as I was cutting it. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and baked them at 425* for 15 minutes. VERY dry. They smelled close to Fair Scones but wasn't close enough in taste. I turned right around and made a second batch, this time with butter and I added a touch more milk. The second time it formed into a ball PERFECTLY and cut without falling apart. I did bake them at 425* the second time also for almost 15 minutes. For a family who is originally from Seattle and is pining away for Fair Scones, this is blessing for us. I didn't have raspberry jam (Fair Scones are cut in half and have a dollop of raspberry jam in the middle of the two halves), I did use my homemade strawberry freezer jam. Not exactly the same but close enough. The smell alone was worth the price of admission.......which is really the whole appeal of the Puyallup Fair. Most locals will agree with me. This recipe's a keeper.",

I did use shortening this time but next time I'll either use butter flavored shortening or just butter or half butter and half shortening. I didn't bake them the whole time because I thought my parchment paper would catch on fire! I do believe that I will cut the temperature down to 425 degrees next time. I made only half a batch and the next time I'll cut them into smaller pieces (personal preference). I guess you keep hearing \"the next time \" and that's because there will be a next time. I'd like to see how they are served at the Fair! Thanks for the recipe!",
