And yes, other juicy fruit like peaches, or other berries will work nicely.",

I live in NJ where blueberries are grown and are awesome so I sought out a recipe to use my massive stock of the yummy fruit. I made no substitutions but I have two suggestions for cooking instructions for novices like me. First I did not anticipate how dry the marinade would be. I would suggest mixing all dry ingredients first before adding oil. I marinated for 24 hours and the chicken really absorbed all those spicy flavors. Second, I had no idea that the cider vinegar would cause the heated sugar to turn into rock candy. I tossed the first attempt thinking I did something wrong. Second attempt I pulled off heat sooner but still had hard globs of sugar. I then spent about ten minutes on and off heat trying to dissolve completely. Eventually it worked and achieved beautiful syrupy consistency of heated blueberries. I followed directions exactly so not sure if problem was my stove. But in the end it was good but a little frustrating along the way.",

I was nervous about the spiciness based on other reviews. I'm glad I did. It was plenty spicy and the blueberry sauce was a nice compliment to the spice. I used 3 chicken breasts (weigh 1.7 lbs total) and butterflied them. Let marinate in rub for about 3 hours. The trick I learned for the blueberry sauce is to use a big enough sauce pan so you have a very thin layer of sugar on bottom and it melts all at same time. If not I had part of my sugar getting very dark underneath and sugar on top not melted. After I added vinegar (I used red wine vinegar because it is what I had and it work splendidly) I had stirred but added the blueberries and let the small shell of hard sugar melt while the blueberries cooked. I didn't add salt or pepper to blueberries because I didn't think they need it. Family loved it. Thanks for sharing!",

I left the mashed blueberries in the sauce because I couldn't bear to throw them out but there still wasn't a blueberry taste. I absolutely loved the concept of sweet and spicy but I think maybe lemon juice would be a better fit with the blueberries. The sauce definitely needs some tweaking.",
