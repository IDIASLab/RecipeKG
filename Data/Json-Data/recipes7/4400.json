You can use any filling you like, but the apricot were my favorite. My grandma hasn't baked for years and I so missed these cookies. I was always intimidated by dough, but I found these to be so easy to work with. Now, I can taste Grandma's cookies anytime. Yum.",

When I rolled out my dough I used a combination of flour and sugar to avoid an overly flourly taste. Depending on the size balls you seperate your dough into you should be able to get 12-16 cookies out of each one. Dont over fill these maybe a tsp of filling or it spreads out and makes a mess. Also these freeze very well... just seperate layers with wax paper. Dont garnish with powdered sugar until you are ready to serve. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",
