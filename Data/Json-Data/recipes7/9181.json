It was highly unpleasant. The texture is good it smells good. The sauce on top seems fine. Just the seasonings are off. I DID make two modifications.... 1/2 the thyme (as mentioned) and instead of 3lbs turkey I used 2lbs turkey and 1lb 93% beef...neither modification would have made the seasonings this overwhelming.",
