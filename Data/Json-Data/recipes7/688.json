I advise you NOT to leave out the 5 spice powder...it's the ingredient that really \"makes\" this recipe. 5 spice powder has a distinct flavor and usually contains equal parts of cinnamon anise ginger cloves and fennel. I made a few alterations that you may find helpful:marinade the chops for at least 3 hours or better yet overnight use a strainer to evenly coat the pork chops with cornstarch use medium or thin cut chops (as thick chops take longer to cook and may dry out)and use less oil to fry them. Our family enjoyed these porkchops and I look forward to making them again. Thanks for sharing.",

I increased the 5 spice to about 1 1/2 tsp. and I used about a 1/4 cup of white wine. Cooking I used a tblsp. of margarine and a little olive oil. Did a high heat sear about 1 min. each side. I then reduced heat to med. covered and cooked 5 min. each side. They were tender and juicy and really flavorful. I served with white rice and spicy Bok Choy which made a spicy kick to the fragrant meat. I will definitely be making this again.",

The trick to this dish is 1)Use thin sliced pork chops, 2) make little slits on both sides, and 3) marinate for at least 3-4 hours.

DO NOT OMIT THE 5-SPICE: it \"makes\" this classic dish. The sweet potato starch instead of cornstarch is a wonderful addition to make this all-the-way authentic. If you can serve with pickled cabbage and an egg hard-boiled in soy sauce and anise. I'd also recommend using VERY thin-cut bone-in pork chops if you can find them-- it makes a big difference.",
