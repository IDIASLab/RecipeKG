As someone helped themselves to my KitchenAid Mixer and double boiler when I was moving I thought this might be an easier way to bring a bit of old home into the holiday. It took 8 1/2 minutes in the microwave checking temp and stirring every three minutes not just 3 as stated. While it doesn't compare to the tried and true full recipe it is good. A nice variation is to take maraschino cherries. dry them so no excess moisture remains. Chop them up and add in after the vanilla it is all mixed. It turns the divinity a pale pink and makes for a nice change.",
