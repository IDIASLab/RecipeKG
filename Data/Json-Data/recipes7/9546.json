So here's mine! I previously had trouble with whole wheat pie crusts; they tended to be hard to work with and crumbly. Then I added wheat gluten, as I do for bread, and voila! This makes enough for one 8-inch pie. If you're making a recipe that requires a top and bottom crust, double the recipe.",

I LOVE this completely healthy pie crust and its definitely my new go-to recipe for my future pies. I don't really get the 21 tablespoons of flour at the end of the ingredients list; probably just a typo for 2 tbsp. of flour so don't forget that! I will upload a picture next time I cut into the pie too early! Thank you so much Misty for sharing!:)",

I used shortening cut into pieces and put in freezer prior to using and ice water. It took 4 tbsp of water for the dough to come together. I let the dough rest but still found it hard to roll. Usually I just substitute whole wheat flour for my regular pie recipe which generally turns out fine but I was interested to see how the gluten affected the texture of this crust. This wasn't a flakey crust maybe because of the gluten.",

While some crusts came out okay this was the first one that had some flake to it it s delicious. I did refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before rolling it out which I believe is one reason it rolled out more easily than any crust I ve made in the past. I made a whole-wheat crust very low sugar tart cherry pie at Thanksgiving as I always do using this recipe and it was the best ever. Making another one for Christmas!",
