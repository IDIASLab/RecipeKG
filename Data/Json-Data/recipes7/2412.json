The truth is that one can eat manjar anytime during the day and in many different ways: with bread, cheese, cookies and, my favorite, with meringue. Some of my foreign friends love it, some others hate it, so I guess you must give it a try and judge then.",

After we added the baking soda it foamed up but did not thicken as the recipe describes.  We got tired of cooking it after an hour and 30 minutes total so into the fridge it went hoping it would firm up.  No luck.  Not sure if we over cooked it or if there is an ingredient missing from the recipe.  Would make it again if I knew how to make it thicken.  Any suggestions??",

A few notes: 1) This takes time but if you cook it on low you only need to check in on it occasionally. When I made it I cooked on low and it took about 4.5 hours but at such a low heat I only needed to check in on it about once every half an hour. That means that it is not a hassle if you are doing other chores around the house. 2) It is very important to strain the dulce de leche before it is eaten or stored. The purpose of the baking soda in this recipe is to keep the milk from coagulating. That being said there will be some small amount of coagulation at the top and these weird bits will interfere with the other smooth delicious experience. I will note that in the past I have made dulce de leche by boiling the can of sweetened condensed milk and the raw ingredient approach produces a far superior result.",
