However, after baking it the original way many times, I have found you can do the following with equally good results and not so many calories:  replace 1 C butter with 1/4 C butter and 3/4 C low fat buttermilk; I use plain almond milk (no sugar) for the milk, and use 1 C sugar rather than 2 cups.  With these changes you've eliminated >500 calories by replacing the butter and 775 calories by eliminating a cup of sugar.  The dish is still sweet and you don't have to feel so guilty about eating it. Oh, I did increase the bread by 3-4 slices to soak up the extra buttermilk. Enjoy!",
