After a spin through the ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions (30 min.) it was just as soupy as when it was poured in. So I transferred it to a stainless steel bowl and decided I would put it in the freezer and stir it periodically adding the nuts and chocolate bits when thick enough. After a few hours no change. When I was getting ready for bed I checked one last time for the night and it had some ice crystals so I added the nuts and chocolate bits. The next morning it was finally in a better state. The thing is the texture was very crystal-y and it melted VERY quickly once served. It's too bad because the flavors are fantastic but the crystal-y texture and time to solidify just stink. Not worth making again. What a shame.",

Added the extra shot of espresso suggested by OP (like lots of coffee flavor) reduced sugar by 1/3 and mixed 2 Tbsp cocoa powder in the sugar (like my chocolate dark) and I still would have liked more flavor. Heavy cream would probably have helped a lot (ours was a little icy) and I might try heating the cocoa in a little melted butter first. This is a great base to experiment from.",
