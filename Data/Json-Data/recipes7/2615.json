                "reviewBody": "Very nice - this turned out quite delicious. I think the recipe has mistake though since 1/4 cup of baking powder is a LOT!! I used only 1 tsp. I also accidentally used too little of the cream cheese and the dough felt like it needed more stickiness - either more cream cheese or an egg. Also didn't have the plum butter so I used home made pear-sauce (like apple sauce). It was a lot of work - rolling it up is not easy and in the future I would use baking paper underneath to help support it. All and all though lot of fun and a good recipe. Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "We like to try German recipes and enjoyed this one.  A few thoughts about it: 1) I figured that the typo for 1/4 cup baking powder probably meant 1/4 tsp. 2) Next time I would beat the cream cheese with the sugar and cinnamon before adding the oil and milk to get a smoother mixture.  3)  I was trying to be authentic to this German recipe and searched for plum butter, but could not find it.  I used a 9 oz jar of organic plum fruit spread from Italy--next time I would use a more economical choice like a common jam or even apple jelly.  The plum spread kind of disappeared among all the diced plums anyway.  4)  Since I don't have much experience cooking with plums, I peel them as I would if cooking with pears or apples...I'm not sure if this is necessary.  5)  Usually I don't add extra sweetness or a glaze to recipes, but I felt that a glaze made these rustic rolls much more attractive and added a tiny bit of sweetness just on the outside.  6)  This needed to bake much longer...about 75 minutes total.  7)  The dough was not very tender even though I did not overwork it.  I would not add the full 4 cups of flour right away next time.  Another reviewer thought adding an egg would help make the dough stickier and that may also help tenderize and rise the dough.",
