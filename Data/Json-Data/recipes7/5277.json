This was my favorite food as a kid, and I have searched every recipe site, but haven't found it!  So I am posting it here for YOU!  I made this for a potluck thinking I would serve it cold as my childhood memories remember, but it was SOOOO good hot that I stuck it in my slow cooker to keep it warm throughout the potluck!  Everyone asked for the recipe!  It was a HIT! You can keep in a slow cooker on Warm/Low for 3 to 4 hours!",

I too found the sauce to be a bit thin so I started over reduced the water & vinegar and increased the ketchup slightly and it cooked down to a perfect glaze. I used legs and thighs and the amount of flavor was INCREDIBLE considering the simplicity of the ingredients. The flavors are very bold and Asian.... you couldn't have convinced me that ginger wasn't in this dish if I hadn't made it myself. Definitely a new favorite.",

It is thin until you continue to baste your chicken in the oven and it thickens all over the chicken as it bakes and mine was quite thick when done.  This flavor is yummy and reminds me of General Tso's Chicken.  Mmmmm good!  I will definitely be using this recipe again with all different cuts of chicken.",

I used Chicken Tenderloin and following the recipe of 3 lbs I had to make a 2nd batch of sauce before putting it in the oven. Followed it to the T and came out great!!! Only thing I will change next time.. More Heat.. at it's written is sweet no kick (at least not to me)... make 1/2 for ltlman and 1/2 for me---HOT! Some stated sauce didn't thicken up....SO not the case - happens in oven stage of recipe. Got thru photos to mine and you can SEE the stickiness! Thank you so much for submitting!!!
