The only other change I made was using regular crushed red pepper, and increased it to 1/2 tsp (as I figured the Korean stuff was probably spicier than regular). It turned out to die for! My kids didn't complain (which meant that they liked it . . . heaven forbid I'd get a compliment), and they even went for seconds. I served this with Jasmine rice and an orange salad for dessert. Seriously, delicious!",

Perhaps it was the beef sirloin I used, even after slicing paper-thin and marinating for a full 24 hours --  it  just didn't have the flavor profile I was expecting. I'd use flank steak next time and grill it versus the stovetop method and would also  marinate for less time.  I had to make more marinade after the 24 hours because the steak had soaked it  up (I wanted more for the jasmine rice and steamed broccoli I was serving).  I may decide to leave this dish up to the Korean restaurants going forward, but I appreciate trying something I'd never had before!",
