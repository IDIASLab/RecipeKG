                "reviewBody": "This was good! I made it to compare it to my M-I-L's recipe she calls Scon (rhymes with Ron she's from County Caven). I have yet to find any similar recipe to hers or anything called Scon. The closest one likely originated in Scotland according to history. Anyways her recipe is: 3 c white flour 1 c white table sugar 3 tsp baking powder 1 c raisins (tip: for those that don't want to buy a big box of raisins it's 4-6 of the 1 oz snack size boxes) 1 egg 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 c whole milk. Preheat oven to 350. Mix by whisk the egg and milk together in a large bowl. Mix the dry ingredients together by whisk in another large bowl. Add the dry ingredients slowly to the wet ingredients while mixing by whisk or hand mixer (I use a whisk and then at the end I use a hand mixer to get any lumps out). Stir in the raisins. Pour into a lightly coated glass loaf pan. It will be full but it does make just 1 loaf. Bake for 1 hour. If a knife inserted in the middle doesn't come out clean after 1 hour cover the edges with foil and bake longer (20- 40 min). I measure and rip off 2 pieces of foil lay it on the stove top crossing each other to place the loaf pan in the center and fold up the sides to wrap the pan easily rather than trying to cover the edges of a hot pan with strips of foil. Try it once cooled a slice is great with a spread of real butter and a cup of tea:)",

That notwithstanding it is delicious. The only problem I had is that the largest cast iron skillet I had is 10\" not 12\". As a result the bread rose pretty high and I had to cook it for 1 hour 25 minutes before it was done in the middle...which resulted in the bottom of the bread being too done. I'm sure a 12\" skillet would have solved that problem. The recipe itself is simple basic easy to follow easy to make. I'll be baking this again!",
