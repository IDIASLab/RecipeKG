I added about a tablespoon more butter to the crust and packed it into the bottom of a 9 inch pan instead of 10. I then cut the other half in half (so if I used the whole cake I would have had quarters) and then I cut those down the middle as if I was making a layer cake instead of cubing it. After I put my first layer of the cheesecake in the pan, I arranged the sliced cake so it covered the surface completely and then put the remaining cheesecake over it.\nThe only problem I had was that it didn't really set in the fridge, but I was using light cream cheese so that may have been the problem. I would definitely make this again, as it got eaten in two days!",
