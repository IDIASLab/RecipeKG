We didn't like the crust at all. I was suspicious to see that it called for 2 C of butter oil in proportion to only 2.25 C of flour. It was too \"short\" and had a rather bland flavor NOT like a sugar cookie at all. Next time I'll probably just make half of a sugar cookie recipe. Next came the cream cheese layer - it was good and had just the right depth on a 15\" pizza stone's worth of crust. Next came the fruit which looked GORGEOUS but took forever to prepare. Then the BEST part of the recipe - the glaze which was delectable! I used a very small silicone basting brush to glaze the fruit and it worked much better than a pastry brush. All in all I'll make it again but with the above alteration to the crust.",
