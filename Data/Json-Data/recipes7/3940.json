This is sort of bland as is so next time I'll possibly do 1.5x the soy sauce sugar mixture and double the sesame oil. I also put in a bit of rice vinegar into the sauce mixture to give it a bit of tang. Be careful not to add too much oil while stir frying (although the noodles stick to the pan easily...) or it'll become a bit too oily. Yummy and much cheaper than buying it at a Korean supermarket!",
