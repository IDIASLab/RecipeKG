                "reviewBody": "Excellent bread! I followed the recipe, substituting coconut milk for the low-fat milk called for.  I don't call my version \"Caribbean Bread.\" I don't think it is particularly Caribbean, coconut notwithstanding. The add-ins are totally optional, and I chose what I had on hand. After the mixing of dry and wet ingredients I folded in 1/3 cup of pistachios ground to small chunks, 1/4 cup of dried sweetened cranberries, and 1/4 cup of Zante currants. I made it in a 9x5 loaf pan and it is fairly shallow, so I think you could use a smaller loaf pan. I substituted Stevia for sugar as I normally do and decreased the amount of salt to 3/8 tsp to compensate for the fact that the pistachios were salted and roasted. I also added a glaze: 1 cup of confectioners sugar and .5 cup of coconut milk. I recommend these adaptations.",
