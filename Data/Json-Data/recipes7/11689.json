That being said, these are great dinner rolls! the first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly, except I ran out of white flour and used about 2.5 cups of whole wheat flour with 1.5 cups white flour. The result was delicious. This time I used all whole wheat flour and upped the sugar to about half a cup--I have a sweet tooth, what can I say? I also skipped the pretzel shape and rolled them into balls. I had the perfect amount of dough for 20 balls in a 9x13 baking dish.",
