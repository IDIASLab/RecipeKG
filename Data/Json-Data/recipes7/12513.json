So I may try it again with thate other fruit. After I mixed it it seemed like quite a bit of filling. I decided to bake it in ramekins. I sprayed 3 of them with Bakers Joy spray and filled them to the fill line on the inside of the cups. I microwaved them for 6 minutes stopping to check them every 2 minutes. (My microwave is a little small and slow). I would do 2 minutes at a time and see where it is at that point. It will have a baked look on top when it is done. Whatever it is put in it does rise above the container while cooking. So don't fill to the very top or it will leak down the mug. I let them cool a few minutes and turned them out of the ramekin. There was absolutely no sticking with the spray I used. I re-calculated the calories for 3 cakes and it came to 135 calories as made above.",

The cake did rise quite a bit but after I removed it from the microwave it sunk back into a dense cake. I liked the texture better than most mug cakes I have tried. It was moist and dense and not quite as spongy as some. It did have a strong banana & dark chocolate flavor. I liked the bitterness of the cocoa but for my personal taste it needed to be a little bit sweeter. It was a little too bitter for me. Next time I would add a little extra honey or opt to add some chocolate chips as the recipe submitter suggested.",
