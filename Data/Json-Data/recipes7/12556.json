Please keep in mind that your soda & baking powder loose potency after about a year after opening.  If you have any problems with bread (or baked goods of ANY kind), check the dates on the containers.  I use markers to put date opened on bottom of can or bottle of powder or baking soda, & throw away after a year.  Most professional food service do this.  HTH!!!      Blessings!",

I made this bread without the raisins in deference to the picky person in my household and I used a multigrain flour because that's what I had in the cupboard. We did find it a bit sweet, so next time I'll try a bit less sugar.",
