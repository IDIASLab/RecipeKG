It has always been a hit with everyone I've served. I've made it with tomato juice and V-8. Both were good but V-8 seems to add more flavor as I suspected it would. The original recipe I used in years past had you add potato wedges for only the last hour. This time I followed the recipe and added them at the beginning. It doesn't seem to make a difference either way. I worried these would be overcooked but they were not. Thank you for sharing this!",
