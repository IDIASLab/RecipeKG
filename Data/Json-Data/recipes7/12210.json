My husband and I are relatively new on the waffle scene so I can't speak to crispy spongy crunch cake like etc. I can speak to the flavor which is wonderful. We even used boring pancake syrup from the grocery! Straight out of the bottle even! We're obviously commoners. The waffles gave the kitchen a fabulous cinnamon and spice scent which is always a bonus in my book. I put a dash of extra cinnamon in the batter but it was unnecessary. These really are yummy..",
