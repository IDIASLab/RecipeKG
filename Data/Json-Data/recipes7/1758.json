I used the Taste of Home pumpkin bread recipe because it makes two loaves of awesome pumpkin bread and for this to be a good recipe you've got to start with a terrific recipe for pumpkin bread. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because the amount of rum in the sauce is way too much for most peoples taste. You could easily use 2 TBSP of dark rum instead of 3. I ended up boiling the sauce in the microwave for 5 minutes just to boil off all the alcohol and give it a nice rum \"flavor\" instead of \"god there's a lot of rum in this!\" I also ended up diluting the sauce with a bit more caramel and heavy cream. So truly a good recipe made better with a few adjustments.",
