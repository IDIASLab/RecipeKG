I used two packages of Persian Cucumbers (small 6\" cucumbers) from Trader Joe's which worked out perfectly for the two quart jars. I didn't add any onions because I didn't have sweet ones but I most certainly will next time. I mixed the sugar and vinegar together but added the spices directly to the jars so they'd be even. I poured the sugar/vinegar mixture over them and sealed them. Occasionally when I went into the refrigerator I would shake them because all the spices will settle to the bottom. I will be making these again and again. I have just tasted them after 1 week and they are good but still taste of cucumber. I will be interested to see how the flavor and crispness develops after more time. I think I will keep the liquid and spices and just add more cucumbers to the jar. Thanks for the great recipe!",
