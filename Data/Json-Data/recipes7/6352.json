I made a bigger amount of food and my noodles were not exactly perfect and it took a bit longer. Overall, great recipe, thank you. I'll be making it over and over again.",

No chicken (I\u2019m plant based), only used 8 oz of noodles so I would have higher vegetable to noodle ratio, and only 2 tbs of sugar because I don\u2019t like an overly sweet pad thai. I added carrot matchsticks & thinly sliced onion as well for more vegetables. I also used tamarind concentrate (not paste, I find it very difficult to work with). I was able to find brown rice noodles which were also delicious & no change in texture or taste.",
