        "description": "In the early 70's, a Greek restaurateur in the city of Halifax introduced the Donair. Within a few short years, virtually all pizzerias had added their version of the dish to their menus. Not to be confused with gyros, the Donair has a vastly different flavor. Originally the dish was made with ground lamb, but this proved too costly and ground beef was later substituted. Technically, this resulted in an aberration of sorts, as the final product was not what the originator had intended. What resulted, however, is the legendary East Coast Donair.",

I was able to let the uncooked mixture sit for a few hours only rather than overnight as the recipe suggests. The sauce was a bit thinner than I had expected but perhaps was due to my method of mixing. I thought the taste sweet/sour was a nice combination with the spicy meat slices. Thank you very much for taking the time to share your recipe with us. I will make this again but will decrease the cayenne a touch and I might try it with ground pork.",

I did add the garlic powder like someone else suggested because that's the kind of sauce I'm used to. Here's a hint no one mentioned. The sauce is thicker right after it is made than if it sits in the fridge for any length of time. So I chilled it a bit and then used it right away. This is fantastic!!!",

We're sort of middle-of-the-road on spicy food (maybe 6 on a scale of 10), and I just knew that 2 tsp of cayenne for 1 lb of ground beef was going to be too much for us.  I added only 1/2 tsp and, yes, you definitely still could taste the cayenne.  We're not too much into super sweet things these days, so I also cut the sugar in half for the sauce which worked out perfectly (personal taste preference).  I mixed the milk and the sugar with my battery-operated whisk, gradually added the vinegar, and ended up with a beautifully-textured sauce.  I had concerns about the sauce, but the combination of the savory meat and the sweet sauce was perfectly balanced.  This was my first Donair, but it won't be the last.  This is a keeper and is going into my Favorites folder.",
