I'm not much of a sugar cookie person, but these taste wonderful and hold up to shaping very well. They don't get dry and hard like so many other recipes. When cookies are cool you can ice and decorate. Store in a tightly sealed container with waxed paper between layers at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.",
