I followed the recipe for spices. Didn't have much flavor if I try it again I'll double the spices leave out the pumpkin since I can't taste it anyway and instead make a whipped pumpkin butter to dab on top. I cut back on the pumpkin in recipe thinking it was the cause of the rubbery texture I read about in the reviews. Thanks for sharing. It's good idea w potential to experiment with. Shortening caused some to burn but I used smaller amounts of batter and cooked it 35 seconds on the iron. This cooked them well.",

I thought they would be a nice change from the family's traditional pizzelles but I wound up tossing the batter out after making just a couple. The batter actually tasted ok even if it was pretty bland. That was suprising considering the amount of spices in this recipe. They had a very odd taste even with 10x suger sprinkled on them. The main issue is the texture. Weird rubbery and limp. Maybe I should have tried making regular cookies with the batter. I've been making pizzelles for 30 years Different flavors and add-ins but I won't be making these again. Would have given this 1/2 star if I could have.",
