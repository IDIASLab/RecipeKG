I used lactose-free milk chopped pecans instead of cashews I increased the craisins/coconut (I did use unsweetened coconut) and I used two packets of Truvia instead of granulated white sugar (I stirred the Truvia into the oatmeal before serving). This was INCREDIBLE. The kids and I LOVED this oatmeal--for me it was like having dessert for breakfast. EXCELLENT.",

I did add some flax seed at the end of the cooking time to make it even more nutritious.  I made the recipe for four and will be having this for breakfast for the next three mornings it appears.  Again delicious!\n\nUPDATE:  I made up another batch and found a suggestion on the www. that you can freeze individual servings in cupcake wrappers and nuke them for a couple minutes, stir and 30 seconds or more.  I now have several individual servings that I can utilize when in a hurry (or not) in the morning.",
