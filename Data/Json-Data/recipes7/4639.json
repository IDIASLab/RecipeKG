Very similar to my Grandma's rolls - the ones she'd make without a recipe she made them so often:) The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of the milk. It added the nice tang. I also used half butter half shortening (butter flavored Crisco) and they turned out lovely with a nice crumb tender and soft. Also I left my dough very sticky.. a bit less flour so reserve that last 1/3 cup to add a couple tablespoons at a time at the end of the mixing cycle in my Kitchenaid and gave it a 5 minute knead. It helps to lighten them a bit. I didn't make them cloverleaf style but rather made 12 rolls in a 13x9 pan. Brushed them with a bit of melted butter after baking and yikes.. they were gone in a flash! Thank you for sharing - this is definitely a keeper.",

Just a tip i grease the bowl with a cooking spray and then once the dough is in the bowl i spray the dough with the spray too- then I am not trying to turn it over. The dough will rise bigger if put in an especially warm place in the kitchen- I use the stove top on one of the rings near the one used for heating the milk. Great recipe!",
