I also livened up the yeast by letting it sit in the bowl with the liquid and sugar for ten minutes before using it. I took half of the dough ball and made four big dinner rolls which were pieces of heaven for me and my family. In the morning I proofed the cinnamon rolls for 1.5 hours before baking (put a bowl of hot water in a closed oven with the cold covered rolls) which helped them rise. They tasted great also. Thanks for sharing your families recipe.",
