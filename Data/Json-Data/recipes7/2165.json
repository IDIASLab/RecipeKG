Instead I added a heaping tablespoon of corn starch to 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup sugar then coated the sliced strawberries and bananas before adding to the pie shell. Topped with the crumble and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes then reduced to 375 for 40 minutes. Served this with some homemade whipped cream. My husband and I LOVED it. We'll be making this again and again.",

                "reviewBody": "Not impressed. First I think the ratio of bananas to strawberries is off. I recommend 1 fewer banana and another cup or two of strawberries. Second the amount of topping this recipe calls for is astronomical! You could decrease by two-thirds and still have enough left over. Third it cooks up like strawberry-banana-soup. Don't try to eat this warm- you'll never be able to get a decent \"slice\" of \"pie\". It fares much better served cold. Fourth because this recipe calls for so much topping it's like eating a mouthfull of dust. You need a half-glass of milk to wash down every bite. The topping isn't good at all. Needs more nuts and much less flour and dry ingredients. The taste of the fruit if you can taste it through all the crust and topping isn't bad. This might be served better with a whipped cream topping rather than the dust-topping this recipe calls for. I can't recommend this one.",

Refrigerate or freeze to hold any sort of pie shape for cutting. As is this recipe is a fail. Tastes good and has potential but falls too short to publish.",
