The roasted sweet potatoes I made with them were a vast improvement but neither Hubs nor I were fond enough of them to eat them again. So what to do with the four or five baby sweet potatoes I had left? I chose this recipe thinking I might as well embrace the sweetness of the sweet potatoes in something like this rather than fight with them in another savory vegetable side dish. And if it wasn't for having these leftover sweet potatoes I never would have experienced this simply excellent bread. Hubs would never have tolerated the coconut or the nuts but since he wasn t about to eat anything Sweet Potato anyway I included them both. As I measured out the cooked mashed sweet potatoes I found myself about 1/3 c. short (1/2 recipe). Not a problem I just grabbed a jar of strained baby food carrots and used them to make up the difference. I liked this it s moist not as heavy as other breads of this type not as sweet (and I liked that!) and is delicately spiced (and I liked that too). I also liked the flavor only butter can impart. Until I made this I probably would have thought it similar to pumpkin bread but it s really not. It s lighter and brighter in color almost like mango and has a flavor all its own. Not sure I ll buy sweet potatoes again but as this recipe s first reviewer I can tell you I couldn't have been more pleased.",

My first thought was, \"YUM!\" This bread has all the best flavors of autumn, and is incredibly moist and satisfying. Because I like to eat breads like this for breakfast, I tweaked the ingredients to make a more wholesome and nutritious bread. I used white whole wheat flour, replaced the 2 cups of white sugar with 1 cup of sucanat (natural dehydrated cane sugar), and replaced the butter with applesauce. Amazing!",
