I used raw carrots for the ears red bell peppers for the eyes and I felt like it needed a nose so I stuck in a piece of cheese. I tossed spaghetti in some sauce and served my rats over it. I did have slight leakage of the cheese like other reviewers but this was definitely yummy! Also I didn't put too much sauce on my rats before baking and heated up leftover sauce and put it over before serving. I saved one strand of cooked spaghetti per rat and draped it over the finished rats as the tail. Thanks for the great idea and recipe.",

Just after I'd pulled these out of the oven my husband came over to tell me something and stopped short when he saw these. His laughing/surprised/disgusted expression was hilarious:) We both really enjoyed these they tasted great and the presentation was so creepy! I used linguine for tails instead of spaghetti and I thought they worked much better than spaghetti would have. They looked more like real tails for the size of the body and they cooked all the way through. We did think the rats were a little over done after 45 min covered and 20 min uncovered and my rats were pretty big. I would probably cut down a little on cooking time next time but otherwise great recipe!! Thanks Angela!",

I did half and half thinking I would save time and wound up with split top rats. Very fun to make and the gross factor sets it off!",

And also froze the cheese cubes 15 minutes before using them. I also noticed that the onion though adding flavor breaks the meat apart. Perhaps chopping the onion very fine in a food processor would help. This would cut down on the cheese ooze during cooking. This is our new Halloween meat dish from here on out.

I am rating this on presentation only because I used my own meatloaf recipe (which is almost the same except no cube of cheese) I did however make the sauce to spoon over top of the rats as blood. I used sliced water chestnuts for ears and pieces of black olive for the nose & small early peas for the eyes. And I cooked the spaghetti first and set aside to cool then added all of the embellishments after baking the rats (eyes ears nose tails) I used a tiny Pamphered Chef paring knife to cut slits and holes as needed... Worked great! Served with a side of BRAINS (Mac and cheese with lots of glommy cheese stirred in and tinted with Wilton red gel) A memorable meal!",

Taste wise it was fine but my family is more accustomed to my meatloaf which never has tomato and I don't used packaged seasonings. I think I'll make this again next year but I might do it spaghetti and meatballs style (spaghetti can either be worms or the \"rats nest\" cuz my creativeness-less self could not think of something to fit it to serve w/ so I tossed it ontop of some shoestring hashbrowns and said they were in a rats nest lol",
