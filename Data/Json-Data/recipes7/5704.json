If you're sensitive to spice consider using a mild picante sauce or salsa instead. That aside this was a delicious easy meal. I substituted condensed tomato soup for the tomato sauce because I realized too late we were out. I also didn't brown my chops first because they were really thin and it would've dried them out. Everything else I followed to a T. I sprinkled green onion over the cheese before serving and added sour cream to make the heat less intense. This was so good and my boyfriend asked me to add it to the rotation... But to make it less spicy next time due to his acid reflux;)",

                "reviewBody": "Note to those who said this was too spicy: keep in mind that picante can mean a couple things in the USA. I believe what this recipe intended was a salsa style picante (something like Pace brand). You can choose the heat level of this type of sauce. Be aware that there are other sauces labeled picante that are more like hot sauce and would make this dish exceedingly spicy. (such as Tapatio salsa picante) I used a medium Pace picante and this dish was not very hot at all, in fact my brother added his own hot sauce on top!\n\nThis dish was tasty and the rice was complimented by all family members. The problem I had was that after an hour when I took the cover off it was still very liquid with about an inch of unabsorbed liquid on top even though the rice was done. I put on the cheese, turned up the heat, and let it bubble and reduce for about another 15 minutes. Then I took it out and let it stand for another 5-7 minutes hoping the sauce would thicken up and it did. Next time I will probably take the cover off after 40 minutes, bake another 20, put on the cheese, and bake another 10. \n\nMy only other complaint is the green peppers didn't seem to add much besides color. Next time I might dice them and add to the sauce mixture instead of on top. For a pop of green you could add jalepeno slices on top at the same time as the cheese.\n\nGood recipe overall and will make again.",
