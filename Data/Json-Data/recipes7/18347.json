I cooked one pancake, then added more milk to the batter; cooked another, same thing, still too thick.  Even with adding additional milk, these pancakes were dense, not even remotely light and fluffy. One thing\u2019s for sure, they really do need a lot more than 1/2 cup milk. The taste was OK, although not quite as pumpkin-y as I would have liked, and texture and taste both could be personal preference.  Doubtful I\u2019ll make again.",
