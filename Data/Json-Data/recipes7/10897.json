I made it exact to the recipe including the sugar as these berries are not naturally that sweet on their own. I used fresh squeezed lemon which adds brightness tartness and enhances the Berry flavour! It turned out incredibly well and was simple to make. Thank you for the recipe it was a huge hit and definitely a keeper!!",

I used bag of frozen mixed berries instead and cut down on sugar (for crumb layer used 1 cup and for berry layer about 1/2 cup brown sugar in both cases). It came out plenty sweet. Next time will try without cream cheese because the cake goes nicely with vanilla frozen yogurt. Great recipe!",
