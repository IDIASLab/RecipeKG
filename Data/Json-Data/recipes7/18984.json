I am neither a cookie person nor a chocolate person and I had made 4 batches (#s 2, 3, and 4 at the unanimous request of my daughter's softball team) before I actually tried one.  I'm so glad I did.  They're amazing.  I only let them cool on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes and they come out soft and chewy. Just perfect.  I  was the cookie mom before,  but now I'm THE cookie mom.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Don't change a thing.",
