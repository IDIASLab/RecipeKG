The ginger snap crust was a hit! Like other reviewers, I had excess filling. The topping was also a hit. I didn't have sour cream so I substituted with plain Greek yogurt, and I didn't have the problem of a too-runny consistency of the topping. Next time I make these, I might leave out one package of cream cheese so I don't have so much leftover filling and to let the pumpkin flavor come through more. This was a huge hit at our family gathering! Thanks for the recipe!",
