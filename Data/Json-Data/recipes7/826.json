However, the dough on top was a bit like thick pie crust, and I thought it could have been a little sweeter. I even gave it a generous sprinkling of powdered sugar. I had never even heard of pandowdy before until I was watching High School Musical and the basketball guy who bakes has a line that he makes apple pandowdy (amoung other things). So I naturally came to AR and found this recipe...its almost a cobbler, but not quite...hence the pie crust top. Thanks for the post! PS Baked in a cast iron pan because another person I was talking to about it said a long time ago they were baked in dutch ovens.",
