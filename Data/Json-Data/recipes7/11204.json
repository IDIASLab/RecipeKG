I knew this would be sweet because of what I've heard so if you don't like sweet don't be making this! I know my granddaughters will love this! The directions and amounts are spot on even down to the amount of sugar for rolling the dough in before baking. I'm not sure if this would be true but I used natural peanut butter and I wondered if this would make the cookies go a little flatter than if it were the more traditional type. I did bake mine for 11 minutes and making half a batch I got 16 cookies with the 4 teaspoon sized scoop. I used my meat tenderizer side of my meat mallet for the design in my cookies. I'm thinking that I would try the cookie again using all peanut butter but the cookie butter for the middle as suggested by the submitter of the recipe. Thanks for a new cookie recipe mtpgroove1!",

I followed the recipe exactly (as usual before submitting a review) and although this is a good recipe I feel it might be even better substituting Nutella for the peanut butter. The peanut butter seemed to overpower the flavor of the cookie butter. So next time I will make this substitution and see how that works out. There is also a recipe online to make your own cookie butter but I have not tried it yet. All in all this is a good recipe that did not disappoint.",

I have been living in Ecuador for the past year and have been so frustrated with not being able to make simple cookies like peanut butter because the icky stuff on the grocery store shelves here is ridiculously expensive and (almost 7 for a small jar) is some off brand made in this country. On my last trip back to the United States I picked up several jars of Trader Joes cookie butter and slipped them into my luggage. So glad I did! Thanks again! And if you come up with any answers or ideas on how to make cottage cheese REAL Cheddar cheese and any of the milk products like cream cheese and sour cream and buttermilk that we are so used to cooking with please post them on all recipes! Those products are NOT available here? Milk comes in a box and is on the regular stock shelves NOT refrigerated? Eggs not put in the refrigeration either? So strange and hard to adjust to other cultures and their cooking styles and tastes! However I still look on All Recipes every day and adding all kinds of lovely recipes like yours. We have had a wonderful time here BUT we are returning to the States soon and I can hardly wait to cook up all the yummy and wonderful recipes from wonderful and creative cooks just like you!",
