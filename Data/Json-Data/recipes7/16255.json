I used fresh Georgia peaches.\n\nThird, I did not use any lemon juice or zest and the peaches had a strong enough peach taste for us.\n\nFourth, I did not use the glaze, which I think would make the dish even better, but the sweetness was enough for us as we are cutting back on sweets.\n\nFifth, the dough top was fluffy and cooked through as I used bread flour and added some baking powder as I did not have any All purpose flour on hand.\n\nYes, I will be baking this one again, might even add or change to some other fruit!\n\nI baked it again today and it was FABULOUS!  Nice and crispy on top and not too sweet.  The only change was I used brown sugar instead of white in the dough and added a bit of extra oatmeal over the top of the dough.  \n\nIt was served warm, room temperature, after I rested it and then I put real Whipped Cream on top!

It helped to have the time guidelines for creaming the butter and sugar, adding the flour and oats, and finally adding the milk - I would never have beaten them each long at each stage, and it really did the trick. I used fresh peaches and cut them up in dice-size pieces for small-child-size bites, and they did not overcook at all. I also liked sprinkling the sugar on top and misting it - I didn't even make the additional glaze for the top because it didn't need it. I can't wait to experiment with different fruit combinations that have this awesome top. I forgot to take a photo - next time for sure!",

I was so hopeful. When it was time to dig in, what a disappointment!  The inside was runny and soggy. Although promised by Chef John that I would not notice the peach skins, I did.  And, I did not enjoy chewing on them. It may be a matter of taste, but the lemon zest and juice overpowered the peaches and the crust was too sweet. My husband, who is not fussy, was not impressed.
