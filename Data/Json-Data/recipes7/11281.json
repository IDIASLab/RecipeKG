The only change I would make next time is to reduce or omit the sugar but that's dependent on the pineapple you have. Ours was more on the sweet side and therefore the addition of the sugar made the salsa seem a little too sweet for us but still a super good blend of all components in this salsa. I can definitely see this salsa going well with chicken and fish. Looking forward to making this again! Thanks for the amazing recipe!",
