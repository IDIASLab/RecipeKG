I get so many compliments on these spritz and have also made batches using 1tbs vanilla, 1tbs lemon with great results and for something different and unexpected.  This dough is just the best to work with.  I have made so many batches of these and they make a lot.* Perfection!  I don't like a tremendous almond flavor so used just 1 tbsp of almond and 1/2 tbsp each caramel and vanilla.  I love the fact that there is no baking soda or powder in this.  The dough is absolutely wonderful to work with, and the finished product is sheer delight.  Tender, tender, tender but keep their shape so nicely.  Makes a nice sized batch, and slide right off the silpats.  thank you so much for this easy but 5 star result recipe.  make beautiful presentation due to the wonderful consistency of the dough.",
