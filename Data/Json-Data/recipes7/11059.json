I made the recipe exactly as written, except for cutting back on the garlic and onion powders per the other reviewer's recommendation (I used 1.5 tbsp of each).  I'd say that 2 tbsp of each is probably sufficient.  This recipe could also benefit from using more vegetables, as 1/2 lb of baby carrots and potatoes isn't very much. I'd recommend using only half the beer and sprinkling some of the spice packet into the liquid, not just on top of the beef.  The meat was really tender though, and Im looking forward to eating it in a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.",

Only used about three cups of water, which was just enough to cover the vegetables in the bottom of the crockpot.  As for the onion and garlic powders, I dried the lean side of the brisket, and lightly sprinkled it with the garlic and onion powders.  I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t use near as much as the recipe calls for, but it was still very flavorful.  The cabbage was maybe the best I\u2019ve eaten, any other time I\u2019ve cooked cabbage, I obviously over cooked it, the timing on cooking it here was about right.  It was all very good!!",
