I'm keeping this!\n\nA couple things I did wrong (not because the recipe told me so!) that I wanted to share, just in case:\n\n*Don't mix the butter in with the flour and cornmeal first!  If you do, you'll get lots of little lumps of cornmeal/butter floating in floury milk.  I don't know HOW I thought this would work... but it was not good.  I blended the sucker with a submersion blender and then it was all good.\n\n*Coarse, stone-ground cornmeal makes for VERY crunchy pancakes!  Again, this problem was mostly solved by the submersion blender - but next time I'm sticking to something finer ground.  The batter doesn't cook for as long as cornbread, so I think the cooking time doesn't give the really coarse cornmeal grains a chance to soften.  \n\nThose mistakes were my own, though, and not the recipes's - these suckers taste delicious!  Thank you!",
