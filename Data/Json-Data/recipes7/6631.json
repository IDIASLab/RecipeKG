I substituted the left over 2 ozs of bittersweet chocolate from the 4oz bar, chopping it into 1/2 inch pieces.  I used good chocolate, fresh ground black pepper and opened a new jar of cayenne.  I baked them on parchment at 350 for 12 minutes, cooled on the pan for 5 minutes and transferred to the rack.  I had a \"warm\" cookie and one that had set a couple of hours.  I preferred the one which sat as the flavor was much better.  Oh and it was so good with a cup of espresso.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  BTW this is my first review after trying many, many recipes.  They were that good!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe just as Chef John said to, right down to the grinding of the black pepper.  But it was that pepper that made me rate this a 4 rather than a 5.  We thought 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper was just a little too much, and for that ingredient in a cookie, that is more important than if this were a main dish of some sort.  I would suggest trying only 1/4 teaspoon.  I loved how the cookies retained their shape and how wonderfully chocolatey they are.  I baked them on parchment for 11 minutes and that was perfect---just a little underdone in the middle.  It was hard to find the currants, but Sprouts had them!  I got about 30 cookies with a 2-tablespoon scoop.  I'll definitely make these again with my adjustment.  Thanks, Chef!",

For my taste, I found the amount of cayenne pepper too overpowering against the very strong taste of the chocolate. I also preferred the batch without the currants. The video presentation was most helpful, but I wished I had watched it first because I beat the eggs and sugar until thick and it made the cookies \ntoo puffy. In the video version,chef John just blended everything with  a whisk. Further, the currant mixture as well as the chocolate \ncan both be done in the microwave, making this a very easy and quick recipe.",

Loved the \"2 steps\" expansion of the taste in mouth: 1st the chocolate and when you think it's all over then the pepper araises to tickle your senses - actually a kind of sexy cookies indeed!;-) Skipped the coffee flavour when making them again and liked them even better (that's why only 4 stars).",
