I'd give this 5 stars, however, the preparation method did NOT work for me, it merely made our counters/floors a sticky mess and made me cranky.  After the THIRD bowl change/hand mixer attempt, I decided to use my mini food processor and that was CLUTCH.  It made short work of this, w/no mess, and gave me the results I desired.  I'm still not sure what differentiates between light/dark?  I made as written and the result was LIGHT, so if you're looking for dark, perhaps start w/doubling the molasses and go from there.  THANKS for the save, JillH!",
