There were six of us and everyone had seconds...and most had thirds...it was just about gone. I used a variety of berries - strawberries blackberries and raspberries (because my teenager ate the strawberries intended for the top prior to the dinner.) I changed a few things to reduce the calories even further. I used Splenda/brown sugar instead of white sugar (I would not do that for the berries on the top though since the brown color is obviously not as pretty.) Sugar-free angel food cake was perfect. I am sure I could sub sugar-free/fat free vanilla pudding for the mascarpone but it really makes the texture and the taste special so I left it in.",

It's just a personal preference. 3) made fresh whipped cream and folded in room temperature marscapone cheese to keep it light and fluffy. Everyone enjoyed it!",
