I did bake it an extra 10 minutes thinking the knife was supposed to pull out clean, then read more carefully and thought I'd wrecked it, but it was still super fudgy in the middle, so probably could have baked longer even and been fine. ( I personally liked the outer edge best where it had baked more.) I sprinkled it with mini chocolate chips before baking then drizzled slices with warm salted caramel and hot fudge sauce, topped that with coarsely chopped toasted/roasted salted almonds and a swirl of whip cream.  Yum! (A good quality vanilla ice cream would have hit the spot, too!)  One tip...I would beat the egg whites/ sugar first and then do the melted chocolate/ yolks.  By the time I got my whites whipped to peaks, my chocolate had started to cool and thicken, making the folding really tricky. I never got \"fully incorporated, smooth and fluffy,\" but thankfully, it still seemed to bake ok, so that was a blessing!",
