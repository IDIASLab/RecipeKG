Oregon is known for their Blackberries for \"crying-out-loud!\" I wanted to rate it fairly so I did use canned. (can't believe I did that) Anyway I really liked that the cobble had a bottom. That's something I will do from now on when baking ANY cobbler. Here's what I didn't like about this recipe. Shortening in the crust. Next time I make I will use butter. The flavor was good but I would have prefered to use fresh blackberries. It was really just \"good \" not great.",
