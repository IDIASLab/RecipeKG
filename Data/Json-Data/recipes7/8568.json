They are sort of cakey, but this can be reduced by omitting half of the cream of tartar, though I prefer them thick and soft. Top with your favorite cream cheese or basic cookie frosting. I find it's best with almond extract and coconut on top. Enjoy!",

I knew these cookies were going to be cakey but I felt that there wasn't enough flavor to the cookie itself---they relied too much on the frosting to make them tasty. I kept going over the recipe to make sure I'd done it correctly too. Sorry about this review sounding negative. I love cookies!",
