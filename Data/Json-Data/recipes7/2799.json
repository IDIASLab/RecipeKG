It is now a tradition in our family, and is on it's fourth generation of bakers!  However, the original recipe I received did not have the 1/3 cup of brown sugar included.  I made it with the brown sugar to see if it is different, and it was entirely to sweet.  Simply removing the brown sugar makes this recipe light, fresh and just a perfect combination.  We eat it both as a side dish, or even as a desert at all holiday functions, and whenever the mood strikes.  Enjoy!",

I came home destined to find this recipe and found it here of course. The only addition that I made was an extra slice of bread. This recipe takes literally 5 minutes to get in the oven. I've served it at Thanksgiving as a side to bake ham and also as a dessert. Adding a little ice cream to the dish is always good as a dessert too. The dish is always empty and the first to go. The items are always in most pantry cupboards which makes it great. Kids and adults love it. I've had to give this recipe to many and still get requests. Give it a try you won't regret it especially if you love a custard or bread pudding.......YUM! UPDATE: I have made this so many times and I can't have Thanksgiving without it. I have expanded on it although it is awesome the way it is. Try adding a handful of golden raisins and some toasted pecans......so delish!",
