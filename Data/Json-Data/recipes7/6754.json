I didn't have Sherry vinegar, so used plain Sherry wine instead, and I added some toasted sesame seeds. The chops marinated all day in the refrigerator. We grilled our pork sirloins over charcoal and the thick rich marinade gave such a wonderful finger lickin flavorful crust to the juicy tender meat inside. I think this would be great on chicken also. I will try the mustard sauce at another time, just didn't have all the ingredients for it.",

                "reviewBody": "Far and away the best marinade I've made including quite a few good marinades from this site. This is in a class by itself. Exceptional flavor that I could easily see using on chicken and beef as well. The marinade was so simple just assemble and measure a variety of ingredients and grate a little ginger. The only challenge was obtaining all the ingredients as there were a few our rural grocer didn't have that I ordered from Amazon (got free shipping when had enough stuff for 25). The mustard sauce was good though it took a little more easy effort. But it's the marinade that rocked our boat. However I agree with other reviewers that using both the marinade and the mustard sauce is well worthwhile and a great counterpoint. And the chops were so tender and moist even though we used a good though not high end cut of pork chops. While I added a few things to the pantry that we weren't familiar with we liked each one and will use them all in this and other dishes. So for those having to add a few items to the pantry these ingredients are not one trick ponies. For those who are likewise unfamiliar with Hoisin sauce it is like a thick not so salty teriyaki. Of course the marinade altered it into something immeasurably better. It was a happy learning experience and a dining delight. This is a blue ribbon winner. My husband and I would happily give more stars if such were possible.",

The sauce was delicious but the meat was not overly flavorful.  My advice would be to make extra sauce for dipping.  Pork is so dense that it's difficult for marinades to soak through very deep and that was the problem with this (and all pork dishes) in my opinion.  It looked sooooo good when it came off the grill but the flavor was a disappointment.",

Since I only used two small boneless pork chops I reduced the amount of ingredients by 1/4 and made modifictions based on what I had on hand and the short (less than an hour) marinating time I had. I substituted powdered garlic and ginger for the fresh since they pack more of a punch in short marinating times. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the combo as written and I used agave instead of sugar because it has a less sweet taste. I eliminated the pepper since I thought the other ingredients added enough flavor. I don't have an outdoor grill so I cooked these on my electric countertop grill for about 8 minutes. These were very tasty and moist. I served this with a saute of green beans, mushrooms and garlic topped with toasted sesame seeds to continue the Asian theme. Will definitely use this marinade again and try it with chicken and tofu as well.",

Don't be thrown off by how many ingredients there are they all work beautifully together and the taste is amazing. don't try to add more or take away anything. you will NOT be disappointed! TIP: if you are using the think chops marinate overnight and remember to turn them or if using the bag option adjust the chops in the bag several times. i use boneless chops about an inch thick ( i have small kids and its just what we buy lol) the flavor is amazing. USE the sauce. creme fraiche is hard to come by where i live so I use sour cream. (not saying this works for dessert it will separate but in this it does.)",
