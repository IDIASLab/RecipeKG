My modifications included all natural peanut butter which is more oily than skippy or jif and I halved the flour so either of those could account for my result. I also substituted coconut oil and nesquik but I think those made it more delicious and I don't think it caused the crumble problem. Because it tastes so good I will try it again hopefully with more cohesive results. Yum!",
