I\u2019ve tried many diff recipes and really the best is gather up enough fresh snow, hard packed, drizzle in the sweetened condensed milk and keep adding snow until a \u201cgood\u201d consistency is achieved\u2026.eat quickly! Putting it back into fridge did result in a chunk, blob of frozen sweetened milk! It\u2019s the process of making it with kids that\u2019s the charm. I am sure \u2018back in the day\u2019 cream and sugar is prolly the only two ingredients on hand, vanilla would\u2019ve been a luxury most families wouldn\u2019t had! Kids will eat anything sweet, that\u2019s why I\u2019d leave out the EGG! Give the recipe a go\u2026just be prepared it will not be like modern ice cream\u2026it\u2019s an adventure that\u2019s why this recipe is a gem!",
