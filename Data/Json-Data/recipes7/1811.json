I heated up the sauce then poured it over the ribs to bake at 325 degrees. I covered the baking pan with foil tightly the first 45 minutes then turned it over to the other side for another 45 minutes. There was a wonderful aroma filling up my house while the ribs were baking. I sprinkled the ribs with toasted sesame seeds before serving. The meat was tender not tough and full of flavor. The sauce itself has a nice balance of slight sweetness with subtle tang in each bite. The sauce also baked right into the meat making it so savory juicy sticky sweet and finger licking ONOlicious! I did not want to waste the sauce so I reserved it to pour over the ribs and rice. I served with Green Bean and Mushroom Medley also from this site.",
