I put the rest in the freezer, and was so curious to find out what it would be like after having been frozen. I thawed it out for dinner last night, and served it with our Turkey Avocado Paninis (also from this site). No one in my family cared for this after having been frozen. It was soggy (even after draining all the liquid) and limp. I tried adding a little mayo to it, to see if that would help, but it only made it worse. It ended up in the garbage. I would give it 4 stars before freezing, but 1 star after being frozen - so I'm settling on 2 stars, considering it's supposed to be \"freezer slaw\".",
