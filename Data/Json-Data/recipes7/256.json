I haven't got a deep fryer so I just heated some canola corn oil to the prescribed temperature in a pot which worked well enough. I also didn't have self rising flour or self rising cornmeal mix so I looked up an online substitute for both which involved adding a little baking powder and some salt. It worked fine. They aren't hard so if these sound good to you have at them.",

They sort of taste like a spice cake with a hush puppy sort of look and texture. I ate something similar recently at a Krystal's restaurant that were called \"Sweet Bites\". I have a Vitamix blender so I put some granulated sugar and cinnamon in it and ground it up to the consistency of powdered sugar. I put the sugar on a plate and just threw them on top of the sugar when they came out of the oil. I think my family is really going to like them (they are all taking naps right now!).
