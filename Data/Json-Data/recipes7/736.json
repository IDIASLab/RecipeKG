Sour cherries--the kind you need for pie--are rarely available fresh or frozen, so the canned variety usually is the only option for most cooks. Not only do canned cherries make good pies, but there's also no peeling, coring, seeding, pitting or slicing the fruit. Just drain, dump, sweeten, flavor and thicken, and you're in business.",

If you like a standard flaky pie crust, chances are that you wont like this recipe.  The cream cheese makes this a very heavy crust with very little flavor.  And I wasnt really a fan of having to \"freeze\" the butter and shortening ahead of time.  The flavor was good, however I wouldnt consider this recipe very easy.....not that it was hard, just a few too many steps for my taste.....My lesson learned.....stick to your standard pie dough recipe.  As for the cherry pie filliing, I didnt find the instructions very explicit.  I had to cook the cherry juice forever before it became a \"paste\"..this in turn left the cherry pie very thick and dry.\nMy advice: Use a different recipe...this one strikes out.",

The only change that I made was that I had an extra Granny Smith apple left over from making apple pies so I sliced it up and added it to the cherries. It gave it that little something extra. And the crust was so good! I put it in the fridge for 1 hour then in the freezer for one hour. It was rich but a little flakey. And instead of just brushing on egg white I used an egg wash (1 part egg white and 1 part water). The crust goldened up so nicely!",
