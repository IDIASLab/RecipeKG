It was too sweet and the hot pepper sauce was not a good addition for us...we used Frank's Redhot Sauce since we don't care for Tabasco (and we like spicy things). We ended up adding 2-3 anchovy filets a bit more red wine vinegar and some black pepper. It was edible but we will not be making this one again.",
