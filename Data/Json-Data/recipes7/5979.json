I made some slight changes to the second batch which I thought made them more my style (thinner, larger and crispier). I left all fat on bacon and used about 1/4 cup of the bacon fat mixed into the butter mixture. Doing these two things gave a more balanced taste, as I felt the first was a little too sweet. I also nixed the salt the second time and only used 1T water for the glaze. I also used a heeping tablespoon to portion out cookies and they were large and delicious!!! Pics included :)\n\nAwesome recipe, thanks for sharing!!!",

I accidentally read the directions wrong and added almost an entire pound of bacon which I didn't discover until after tasting...though I think I'll do the same thing next time because I thought they were perfect as they were. I probably wouldn't feel the need to add the 1/2 tsp of salt and would use unsalted butter if I were going to include that much bacon again (though I didn't think they tasted too salty I'm sure the Sodium count was probably fairly high with all of those factors together). I also added 1/2 tsp maple extract in addition to that amount of vanilla. I made the glaze but did not care for it as I notice is my preference regarding powdered sugar based glazes. I just brushed a bit of real maple syrup across the tops and they were perfect.:)",
