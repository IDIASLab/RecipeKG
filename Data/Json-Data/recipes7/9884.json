Myself AND my husband loved this dish - he is uber picky so that is telling you something! I realize that others take issue when you review based on your own modifications but I was out of one of the main ingredients so I subbed (tomato soup).  Here is what I did - First I seasoned the heck out of the beef with salt, pepper and lemon pepper.  I used flank steak because I can not stand how fatty beef stew cubes always seem to be at my grocery store.  Then I didn't have the tomato soup so I used French onion - we are onion fanatics so this was great.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and replaced the water with beef broth.  Holy flavor town!  I left out the bay leaves because I personally can't stand them.  The steak sauce addition was so awesome - loved that ingredient!!  Until this recipe I always hated the way my stew came out - not anymore, this is a staple in our house says my husband!  I didn't have enough time so I did the crockpot on high for 6 hours - great.  THANK YOU!!!",
