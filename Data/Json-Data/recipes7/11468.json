Use 100 ml skim milk. Use 3/4 cup white sugar. Use 1/4 cup oil.  Don't bother using a blender--to me, it makes no difference. Mix the dry ingreds in a bowl, mix the wet in another bowl, and then mix until just combined. Toast 2 TB fennel seeds and fold them in at the end. Bake 35-40 minutes and cool in Bundt pan on a rack for about 6-7 minutes, then remove from pan. Also, this is 16 servings (or 12 larger ones) for me, not 8. Have a warm slice with coffee--delightful. :)",
