                "reviewBody": "This is a very good recipe. It has definitely a cream cheese taste. I had to add approximately a cup of flour more because like someone else mention it was too soft to roll. I also used one cup of sugar instead of three maybe this is why the dough was difficult to work with. I also put some flour on the surface where I was rolling the dough and it was more manageable. Using real (unsalted) butter would definitively make a difference and if you carefully put them in the (real) cinnamon and sugar mixture right after they come out of the oven the sugar will stick easier to the empanadas. Use a spatula because they are very hot. I recommend using cookie cutters to make different shapes. You would have to make two of the same shape so that you can cover them after you put the preserve. I used hearts and teapot shapes because they were easier to close after putting the preserve. Make sure that you close them tightly using your fingers and smooth out the edges. If you make the pineapple preserve yourself they would be absolutely delicious. To prepare that cut out a fresh pineapple (without the centers) into very small pieces add about a cup of sugar (for a small) pineapple cover and refrigerate overnight. The next day bring to a boil for only one minute (the pineapple will loose its color if you leave it longer). Let it cool and drain the excess juice. You can also use \"cajeta\" (caramel) as the filling.",

The second time I rolled them out a little thicker and cut them out with a biscuit cutter them rolled out each cut piece to a size easy to work with. Other fillings work well too such as mango. I did make some small changes. Instead of rolling in sugar after baked I used a salt shaker filled with cinnamon and sugar to cover the finished product. I have also used a sifter to cover with powered sugar. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.",
