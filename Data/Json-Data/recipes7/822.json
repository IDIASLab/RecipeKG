After cooking, I passed everything through a vegetable strainer and this eliminated the issues one reviewer had with the peels. The balsamic vinegar was a nice touch noticed by no one but the sauce disappeared and all guests were happy. I left out the white sugar and salt. After 1 hour on low, the sauce became the perfect consistency for using with tubed, short pasta as it gets stuck inside the tubes and fills your mouth with tangy sauce. We added extra peppers for some heat. Grazie MADAMEMIMI for your recipe.",
