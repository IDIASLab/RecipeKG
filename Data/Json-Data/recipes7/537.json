The only thing I want to add is that to get that authentic \"taste\" of restaurant fried rice, you should add about half a bottle of Oyster Sauce.

Back off on that much if it tastes too strong, but after years of living in Japan and trying many versions of fried rice recipes, oyster sauce is the ticket!",

Once cooled, roll the thin egg pancake up like a cigar, then cut it into shreds, chiffonade-style. I also added some chopped green onion and small, cooked shrimp.  Small but important preparation changes result in a better, 4-star outcome.",

I have to admit when following the instructions as written, I really wasn't impressed.  Frying the rice after cooking it made it very glutanous and the soy to taste left me feeling like I was guessing.  Today I went back read the reviews and tried again and this time I loved it.  1.) Mixed 1/3 c. lite soy, several drops of sesame oil (or oyster sauce), and 3 2/3c. chicken broth in a large measuring cup and set aside.  2.) Rinsed the rice in a colander under cold running water for two minutes to wash off some of the gluten.  3.)  Heat 1/4c. canola oil in a heavy bottomed pan over med. high heat and add rinsed rice.  Stir constantly until golden.  4.) Add the soy/broth mixture, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.  5.) In a separate pan, fry the eggs, heat the peas and carrots and any other add ins. Set aside.  6.) Add the egg mixture to the rice when the rice is done.  For us, frying the rice before adding the liquids really does make all the difference.  ",

When cooked through, I roll the circle o' egg up and cut chiffonade-style, adding the shreds to the pan after seasoning the rice and veggies with soy sauce.
