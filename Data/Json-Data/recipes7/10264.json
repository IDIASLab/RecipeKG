It comes closer to the German Kaiserschmarrn. You can use peaches, pears, nectarines, whole blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, or a combination of fruits (or frozen berries), plus raisins if you like them.",

You might even consider adding some lemon or orange zest instead of the cinnamon.",
