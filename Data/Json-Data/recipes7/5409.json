If the apples are very sweet I would use less sugar for the filling. Mine turned out a bit too sweet. Also leave the apples a little on the crispy side. Next time I would add some chopped almonds. The glaze is fantastic and an absolute must. I hope I have some left over for tomorrow morning because my husband is sampling again and again.",

I was a bit scared because I didn't see it rising much but then I'm pretty new to breadmaking and I take it this type of pastry isn't intended to have the dramatic rising effect of most bread. The term \"doubled in size\" baffles me however as every bread recipe uses this measure and it apparently means vastly different things to different breads. But it was excellent. The filling was DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper.",
