        "description": "This is the result of my trying to create a cut-out cookie homage to the cherry cheesecake martini my friends and I enjoy at our local martini bar. Unsweetened Kool-Aid&reg; gives these cookies their pretty pink color with just the right balance of sweet and tart. You could certainly substitute strawberry, tropical punch, or even pink lemonade Kool-Aid&reg; if you prefer. Just be sure to use the unsweetened powder. Glaze with your favorite frosting or icing and decorate as desired. I glazed my cooled cookie hearts with Sugar Cookie Icing by JBS BOX and sprinkled with purple decorating sugar, as I was sending these hearts to wounded soldiers at a military hospital. Tint the icing the same color as your decorating sugar for an intensely vibrant, colorful cookie.",
