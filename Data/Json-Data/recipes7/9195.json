When cutting the cookies I made 2\" x 2\" squares which resulted in 36 squares. This cut resulted in the cookies looking like cake squares and they are NOT cake squares but cookies. Next time I prepare I will cut into 2\" x 4\" bars and should have a yield of 18 bars. The icing I used is the recipe for Buttercream Icing by Sharon Gerstman here on the AR site. Thank you Wicked Creations for your recipe and I am glad to see it has received kitchen approval by AR.",

Inspired by the bakery @ my local grocery store today where they were giving out samples of sugar cookie bar topped with cream cheese frosting fresh apple and drizzled with caramel sauce. Made a few adjustments based on the reviews. Increased the flavorings by adding.5 tsp maple and butter flavors. Swapped 1/2 cup of sugar for dark brown. I used fresh whole wheat flour for 3 cups and 2 cups AP flour. It smells amazing has a fluffy texture almost like a blonde brownie. Can't wait to frost it and top it for dessert tonight.",
