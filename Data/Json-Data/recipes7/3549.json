I had a hard time finding a blueberry pie recipe with flax. I am not a fan of graham crack crust but the blend of the almond and flax gave it a nutty sophisticated flavor that is so easy to make! I am not a pie crust making person. I always mess up and have to start over since I do not make pies often but this one is so simple a elementary school kid could make it! The 4 cups of blueberries is the most I've ever seen in a blueberry pie recipe but man you really know you're eating blueberry pie when you bite into this one. I added more butter to the crust recipe (1/2 cup total) which made it easier to apply to the 9inch pie dish as well as making it more buttery. I made extra crumble for the top because I don't know about everyone else but I never seem to have enough pie crust. I cooked this pie for 30 minutes the top seemed to start browning too much when cooled it had the consistency of pudding is this what it's supposed to be like? Or should it be firmer like a cheese cake? Anyway try it! You won't be disappointed!",

The pie wasn't the least bit sweet blueberries at their purest! I do think after discussing it with my tasters that the filling could be improved by adding some lemon or other citrus zest to give it that kick needed to make this five-star. I love the nutty taste of the crust and crumble- I had enough to completely cover the top of the pie so I did and evenly spread it out. Would make this again in a heartbeat!",
