Recipe doesn't say to cover but I did after about 45 minutes as the meat was pretty tough. I adjusted the oven temp up to 375 too. Not sure why the recipe calls for all the flour which I ended up having to toss. I think if I make this again I will put some of the flour into the soup mixture as it was very runny. The taste of the sauce was good but would have preferred it had thickened up while baking.",
