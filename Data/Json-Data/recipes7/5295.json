I actually didn't measure the seeds just used whatever was there so I'm pretty sure that I used more than 3/4 cup. I did have to move the sugar/beer mixture to my bigger pot because once it started boiling it seemed like it was gonna boil over. We LOVE the sweet and spicy flavors of this brittle. Thanks sueb for our new favorite way to enjoy pumpkin seeds...this is definately gonna be a new tradition!:)",
