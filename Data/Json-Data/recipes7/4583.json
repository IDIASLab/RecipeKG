Add 1 cup of toasted & cooled chopped Pecans to the base ingredients & bake in a 9 x 11\" pan as directed. Use 2 c of heavy whipping cream (whip previously) rather than cool whip. World of difference in the taste! I use more than 1 c of heavy whipping cream for the top as more is needed to spread in that size pan! Top with shaved chocolate curls chocolate wafers as suggested or just shake some Hot Chocolate through a strainer for even spreading. The topping choices are up to you! You will not be disappointed & this will disappear fast! Delicious Treat & not too sweet!",

I double the crust since I was going to use an 11x14 pan and it was a little bit too thick. I think next time I'd do 1 1/2 the amount for the crust. I also ended up using more whipping cream to cover the whole dessert and added a little bit of powdered sugar to sweeten it slightly. I didn't have wafer cookies so I chopped some Reeses peanut butter cups and sprinkled those on top - to die for!!! Very rich but I WILL be making it again - you can count on it!",
