It was a good pie, but I'm giving it four stars only because it was just what we expected.  It was a pie just like your average apple or peach pie that happened to taste like Mangoes.  It was good and everyone enjoyed it, but it's nothing exotic.  I would definitely make it again though because 1) it was tastey and 2) the crowd really loved it because they'd never had a mango pie.  The green mangoes were really easy to fine ($1.09 a piece in California) and 8 of them filled it way up, which is what I like.  I made homemade crust because I think it's better and cut a petal design on the top.  Great with vanilla ice cream!  Oh, make sure to put a cookie sheet under this one- juices spilled all over my oven!",

I used frozen mango chunks let them thaw in a colander then tossed them with the rest of the ingredients (I find the filling bakes up better this way rather than layering). I also used only a pinch of nutmeg and a bit less sugar (and I adjusted for a 10-inch deep dish). So easy and soo tasty! I thought baking the mangos might turn them to mush but no - they held their texture wonderfully. Gotta go have a piece right now!",
