The majority concluded that something decadently chocolate would probably be the only thing worth that kind of commitment, but I personally thought this was pretty darn good, as well.  The jury's still out with the rest of my group, which is fine - more for me!!!  The only tiny change I made was to substitute orange extract and vanilla extract for the orange-vanilla flavoring.  I made a rum sauce (rum, butter, and brown sugar) and poured it all over the top of the pudding when I removed it from the pan.  DELISH!  I've been eating it for breakfast for the last several days.  I would probably add a tad more orange marmalade next time to make it more orangey-good, but this is still wonderful.",

Here are my substitutions: I used aquafaba (chickpea water) for egg. Use 3 Tbsp AF per egg so about 1/2 c 1 Tbsp for the 3 eggs. Coconut oil instead of butter. Cashew cream & lemon for buttermilk (Soak cashews overnight blend into a thick milk I keep this in fridge. For buttermilk I juiced 1 lemon then added cashew milk to total measured amount of 1 3/4 c). I hused 3/4 c maple syrup instead of sugar so I heated it with the buttermilk & figs instead of mixing it with the dry ngredients. I also made my own orange marmalade (finely chopping an organic orange and simmering with maple syrup and a bit of water). My final change was to stream it using a steamed pudding mold in a pot of water. I know I made a lot of changes but your recipe gave me a great base to work from. This was my first attempt at it and I loved the result. Thank you!!",

I read other reviews that the cake only needs to be cooked for 90 minutes instead of 2 hours. It's true I cooked it for 90 minutes and it was done plenty good in fact it was starting to burn around the edges. I made a cream cheese rum frosting using rum extract ( frosting a little thin) to put on the cake after the cake cooled.",

And yes my oven temperature is correct and it was baked on the middle rack of the oven. I made a second one and took it out at 1 hour 35 minutes. It too had a burned crust. I removed the crust and sliced the cake in thin wedges for an event. The cake flavor minus the burned crust was very good.",
