I cut the melted butter by half and substituted homemade applesauce for the other half. I also increased the baking powder/baking soda and cinnamon to a teaspoon each and I used organic raisins. Very good zucchini bread recipe--very moist and slightly chewy. We really liked the cinnamon sugar topping but there needed to be a little more. We'll increase it next time. I think I'll add a half cup of pecans next time, too, as one of the other reviewer's suggested.",

Loved the raisins, which contributed interest as well as flavor.  My raisins were a little on the dry side but plumping them up for about 10 minutes in hot water did the trick (actually, I really liked how they turned out, all puffy and moist, and I just might do that from now on!).  The simple cinnamon-sugar topping was just perfect for these muffins, which I baked at 350 degrees.  This batter was so nice, and so accurate that I'll keep it in mind to substitute carrots or apples as well.",

The recipe didn t specify what size loaf pans to use and there are a lot of different sizes out there. A word of caution don t use two 9x5 loaf pans like I did! You will end up with very short squatty loaves. Mine probably were only about 1 3/4 high a big disappointment. I would think 8 1/2x4 1/2 pans would be more appropriate for this recipe. I would definitely make this again with my tweaks and use smaller pans!",
