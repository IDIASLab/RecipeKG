For the sauce I added a combination of Italian whole canned tomatoes and pureed tomatoes. The roasted red peppers give the sauce a nice smokey sweetness. I also added garlic Italian seasoning oregano and basil as well as fennel seed. I learned from another excellent recipe on this site to add the fennel and it really make the sauce taste nice and meaty sans the meat. I also made the pita cheese bread with the paprika and that was quite good too.",

Somehow allrecipes messed up the pita bread recipe. Here is a corrected version. Open the pitas put a light and even spread of butter on the insides. Sprinkle lots of parmesan cheese and then put on some SWEET PEPRIKA -- i like to make a light sprinkling across each piece. If you want you can saute some garlic and onions before you throw in the egglant chunks. The cubes of egglant should be about 1/2 x 1/2\". The sauce is even better when you weave in some mozzarella cheese at the end when you're mixing the pasta and the sauce together.",
