Not a fan of the corn called for I substituted chopped celery and added some minced garlic. I don't use turkey sausage so I used Italian sausage instead. As it browned I added a good glug of Chardonnay. Both the garlic and the wine I believe contributed to what might have otherwise been a \"flat\" tasting soup. Once the soup was done I was not happy with how thin it was so I cooked another cup of rice in chicken broth added that to the soup and it was MUCH better. I garnished it with a squirt of mascarpone cheese and fresh chives. I like this! It's different!",

I stopped measuring ingredients long ago and now double this as a requirement for my people:) We have used all manner of leftover rice in this soup (I throw leftover rice in the freezer in prep for this soup!!) but yellow rice is our favorite. We are actually having this again tonight for dinner. I only wish all my boys would leave me leftovers for lunch the next day... Original review from 2014: Great soup! I used regular pork sausage b/c I couldn't find turkey and I was afraid my young ones wouldn't like the heat - although I can see where it would really add alot! My husband added some hot sauce to his bowl and again to his second.:) I added not quite twice as much rice but I was also short on corn. Will definitely be making this one again!",
