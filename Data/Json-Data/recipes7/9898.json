But once they're baked - so good!  I did change three things because I didn't have regular wheat flour or walnuts on hand.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and used wheat pastry flour.  And I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I'm not sure if the pastry flour or the peanut butter variation was the difference in timing, but these needed to bake 11-12 minutes for me.  Worth the wait!  They will not last long.  Note that they don't spread much either, so you can fit a lot of little cookies on a tray.  I made them on parchment and had no issue with the bottoms over browning as the recipe warns.  Great moist, dense texture without being too heavy.  Thank you for a winner!  I was going to take these to work, but I think they won't make it out of the house :)  The only thing I may try next time is a shot of cinnamon, which I love with oatmeal and banana.",

                "reviewBody": "I also used the peanut butter version of this recipe and decreased the salt to about 3/4 tsp. This is a fluffier type cookie that doesn't spread out much. Love the fact that it uses whole wheat flour and oats. I also substituted fruit puree for the other half of the butter. Healthier alternative to a traditional chocolate chip cookie. Plan to try next time without the peanut butter for a totally different taste. These are even better the second day. My teenagers loved them. Just made these for the second time today. (9-12-14) This time I used the original recipe (no peanut butter) because I am taking them to a youth volleyball tournament (food allergies). I threw in extra banana and a few extra chocolate chips since I am not using any nuts. Still used the fat substitutions as listed above. This is a very forgiving recipe allowing for modifications. Had to try 1/2 of one before I take them tonight. Couldn't resist eating the other half! These are so soft and delicious. They do need to bake the full 12-13 min. and cool on the pan as per the recipe. These will be a definite repeat!",

I made 1/2 recipe and it yielded 30 cookies with a standard cookie scoop. For this amount of the recipe I used 1 large sliced frozen banana I defrosted in the microwave. It came to 1/3 of a cup. The footnotes mentioned adding extra banana as okay. These were actually chewy and I like how healthy they were with the banana walnuts oatmeal wholewheat etc. I liked how all of the different flavors could be tasted. Also I didnt toast the nuts. Almost all come that way today and dont like the burnt like taste they can impart from double roasting. The cookies took 15 minutes to bake on a parchment lined sheet. My only issue is that they are chewy when first baked because of the melty chocolate. The next day they turn into more of a dense cake like cookie. I guess similar to the boxed whole grain cookies. At least this is healthier.",
