I often eat yogurt for breakfast, and typically top it with a spoonful of granola.  I put the pan into a 375\u00baF oven, and set the timer for 30 minutes to do my first cooking check.  I wasn\u2019t in the kitchen, but at 20 minutes, I smelled something burning in the house.   Sure enough, opened the oven door, and found not Dark Honey Pecan Granola, but Burned Honey Pecan Granola.  Smoke everywhere, I\u2019m surprised that the smoke alarm didn\u2019t go off.  I fully expected that this wouldn\u2019t take 1 hour 15 minutes to bake scaling down from 96 to 6, but certainly didn\u2019t expect this to happen at less than 20 minutes.  Could there be a typo on the oven temperature?  I don\u2019t know what else would have made this happen.  Unfortunately, this was a total loss today, completely inedible.",
