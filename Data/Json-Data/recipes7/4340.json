So I used canned peaches instead and drained them. Make sure to put the nutmeg in the cottage cheese mixture because the description does not instruct you to do so. I almost missed it...it makes a huge difference in flavor. I got a little lazy with the stacking and just started eating them like regular pancakes lol. Very good thanks for the post. By the way this makes tons of filling.",
