I baked my muffins at 350* for almost 22 minutes. These muffins were moist, chewy, flavorful and all around just WONDERFUL. One of the best pumpkin quick breads I've ever made.

Granted, I didn't use the the Chinese spice either, just went with what I had on hand, which was pumpkin pie spice, I used 3 tsp of it. The rest of the recipe I kept the same . The reason I wanted to use this recipe is, it only makes one loaf. It is SO moist and just wonderful. Mine didn't turn out as high as in the pic above, but nonetheless, a wonderful pumpkin bread recipe, delicious. Thank you!",

This is a spice I really like and use regularly in stir-fry cooking, and what a great addition to a sweet bread recipe!  Anyway, I made this exactly according to the directions.  Turned out moist, delicious, and with great flavor.  The batter is THICK, so at first I thought I left out some critical liquid ingredient.  Not so.    The bread is not overly sweet, which I love.  The boyfriend liked it very much.  As usual, Chef John has it going on!\n\nMade it a second time using toasted pecans and  \"heaping\" amounts of the cinnamon, Chinese 5 spice, and all spice.  Brought it to Thanksgiving for a breakfast bread.  Everyone loved it!",

I also roasted pecans instead of walnuts, and last I used fresh pumpkin b/c I had some left over but will try canned next batch.  This recipe is a keeper for sure, the only thing you need to know & from reading other reviews I can concur is that it takes an additional 30 minutes to bake - such a no big deal, everyone's oven is different.",
