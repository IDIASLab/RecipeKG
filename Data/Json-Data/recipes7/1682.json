I do agree with one of the other reviews that there was not enough \"dressing\" but this may very well have been my own mistake because I accidentally used self-rising flour. Oops!

After adding the vinegar sauce to the potatoes I doctored it with just a little bit of mayo mixed with spicy brown mustard just to add enough sauce to cover the potatoes. (got this idea from another recipe that used vinegar mayo and mustard) I will definitely make this again!",
