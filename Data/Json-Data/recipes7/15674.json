The aroma as it was baking was divine. Mere words can t describe the taste and texture so if you re reading this make it and see for yourself. We love it. I thought I had bittersweet chocolate squares but I did not so I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the drizzle. Otherwise I followed the recipe and 55 minutes was the perfect baking time. Five stars for sure.",
