Our grocery store had different flavors of sazon, so like another reviewer, I found on online substitute which called for equal parts ground corriander, cumin, garlic powder, and paprika.  By using the substitute I was able to leave out the salt too.  I didn't have pitted olives, so I just used the standard green manzanilla olives, ~18 of them or 1/3 cup.  Next time I'll finely dice these olives to have a more even distribution in the dish.  I really liked the sweet of the raisins with the salt of the olives.",

They serve picadillo there, but this has SO much more flavor - I love the sweetness of the raisins against the capers & olives, along with all the spices. I make it with a good quality grass fed beef and on my 2nd try, I added some of my mother in law's sofrito from Puerto Rico. She makes it with culantro, but I can't find it here. I made it exactly like you said the 1st time around and it was awesome. I didn't find it too salty at all. It's in my recipe box :-)",

The raisins and olives and tomato sauce and green pepper are a must have. Also, I removed some of the oil, but not all of the oil. The cumin is a must have in this recipe. Also, i soak the raisins in hot water to make them plump and soft. \n\nThis is good with a fried egg on top! Make this for your family. They will love it!  I'm from Miami, so I had already made Cuban picadillo a bunch of times, from another recipe. \nYou can also add some fried potato to the mixture. I never tried it with capers, though.\nMy son loves it and now he and his wife make it all the time, too. Thank you for this recipe.",

I served it with Tostones and Spicy Mayo and everyone gobbled it all up. My only recommendation would be to dice the olives a little more finely and I added about 20 small olives versus 6 large ones.
