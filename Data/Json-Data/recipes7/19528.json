I followed the recipe for these, and the pancakes were like mochi; they rose but were dense and chewy. Maybe I should have pulled my sourdough starter out of the fridge earlier so it could fully activate. I don't know, but I will find another way to use my excess sourdough starter and my buttermilk.",
