I only got to taste the leftover crumbs because my family ate the whole thing Christmas Day. The second year I baked it the night before Christmas and left it on the counter. When I got up Christmas morning, a fourth of it had already been eaten. Serve all by itself or with ice cream and/or fruit.",

Also, I really miss the buttery taste that you typically expect in a pound cake.  I added the wine to the cake and the glaze, but I couldn't taste it at all.  Maybe that's why the recipe submitter said to use the cheapest white wine you can find (but I didn't).  Thanks Donnasa.",

My cakes have come out SUPER moist every time!\nThank you for such a Fantastic Recipe!  It's being passed around Huntsville, and I expect in a few months it will be made all over the states!",
