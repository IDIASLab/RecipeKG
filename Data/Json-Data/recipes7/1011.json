So I ended up using about 6T melted butter and all of the sugar/cinn mix (that seemed like a lot too) and it came out awesome. I didn't have any issues spreading the cream cheese when I beat it really well like others suggested. I am a big fan of cream cheese, and I wouldn't suggest doubling the filling. As long as you really whip it up, it's more than enough. Also, flour your rolling pin before you roll the dough out. Yum yum!",

At Thanksgiving I give it a twist by using 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese add 1/2 cup additional sugar 1 can pureed pumpkin and 1 beaten egg to the filling. It turns out great every time. At Christmas I add 1 cup eggnog I also use 2 8-ounce packages cream cheese and 1 teaspoon rum extract. Instead of the cinnamon added to the sugar I use nutmeg. The rest of the year I just make the good ole original one but I always use 2 packages cream cheese and use 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 1 as called for in the recipe filling.
