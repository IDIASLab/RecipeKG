I did use agave nectar (syrup) instead of sugar, because agave is a low glycemic natural sweetener, which won't give you a sugar rush-then-crash. There was a nice strawberry taste, as I used most of the berries in the drink, with only a little chopped on top. I also mixed all the ingredients together at the same time.  I thought that  2 servings was just right for me as a single serving! Highly recommend.",

As usual, because of my obsession with nutrition, I use conventional recipes as a place to start, and modify with more whole or local foods than those called for.  I used raw honey instead of sugar, frozen strawberries that I had bought at the farmer's market while in season, and raw milk and my own homemade raw milk yogurt (which is more liquified than conventional yogurt).  I ended up using less milk because of the viscosity of my yogurt, and no ice because the strawberries were already frozen.  It was fantastic!!",
