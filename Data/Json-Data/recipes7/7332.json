The only changes I made were adding two dashes of cinnamon and substituting the tapioca for flour as I didn't have any tapioca on hand. Also my peaches were very juicy so next time I'll add more flour so it won't come out so runny. My fault though no reflection on the recipe. The only thing thing bad I could say about this pie is that I haven't made it sooner. Thank you.",

While I usually enjoy warm pie this one is much better cool. Because of the other review I sprinkled cinnamon on the crust but I think I'd have loved it with or without. The texture was good with a perfect amount of tapioca to keep all the juice from running out when you cut a piece but not so much that it was like jello. I used the entire egg yolk on the crust which made it a very pretty color.",
