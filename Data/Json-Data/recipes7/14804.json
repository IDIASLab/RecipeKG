I will def be making these for Halloween YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I loved the lemon flavor of the icing. It really complimented the cupcake. This recipe made 24 regular size cupcakes not sure if they figured 2 per serving or what. I omitted the nuts we are not fans and doubled up on the chocolate chips. My only complaint would be that the chocolate chips settled to the bottom of the cupcakes and the icing never made it to the easily spreadable stage it was kind of runny. Still delicious and definitely something I would make again!",
