My only problem with the recipe, since I do a lot of canning, is that I like to know weights for the amount of vegetables needed. I use pickling cukes that we grow in our garden and I've found that a good estimate for the amount of cukes you will need is roughly 1 lb per pint. I also recommend letting the relish sit for a few weeks (6-8) before opening one of your jars so the flavors fully meld and the relish sets nicely, just like you would with pickles. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I used 3 very large onions instead of 4, and substituted one large red pepper for the 4th onion.  I left the ginger out and substituted mustard seed instead.  I ended up with almost 11 half pints.
