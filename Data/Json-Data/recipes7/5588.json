Kept everything else the same (including 6 cups of A/P flour), and let the KA do all of the kneading.  This yielded absolutely beautiful dough so easy to work with.  I'm new to yeast bread baking, and I wasn't sure what dipping the dough into the baking soda-water mixture did, but you definitely get a little bit of that taste, and that's a good thing, so don't skip this step.  I formed these into different shapes...coiled,  square, round, made a few bread sticks,  and topped with Trader Joe's kosher salt.  Next time I make these, I'll make more bread sticks because they are delicious dipped into mustard.  The baked bun texture is perfect, the dough very pliable (not at all sticky), and the flavor similar to the mall pretzels.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe...this one is going into my favorites folder.",

I only used 1 1/2 cups milk, used 3 cups bread flour and 3 cups AP flour, 6 Tbsp oil and 3 tsp yeast.  The dough wasn't sticky at all.  Came out very pliable and easy to work with.  I divided it into 12 balls, slit an X into the tops dipped each into the hot water bath then let rise for about an hour.  Then I brushed with the butter and sprinkled with Kosher salt.  Only baked 20 minutes and they were just \"crunchy\" enough on the tops yet sooo soft inside.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

Followed step 2 exactly except I used 1 1/2 c milk (not 2c) in a kitchen aid mixer with bread hook attachment. Slowly added in the remaining 3c flour, and after that I spread flour on countertop to knead the dough.  I kept adding a little flour here and there while kneading to keep it from sticking to the counter, then I put the dough ball in a plastic tupperware bowl with seran wrap on top to rise (no need for oil if you use plastic bowl).  The dough was sticky but not unmanageable. After it rose I again beat the hell out of the dough on a floured countertop. After it was finished I didn't have time to bake it that day, so I put the spiral dough balls on parchment paper on a baking sheet in the fridge overnight. I did the baking soda hot water dipping right before baking, my rolls were pretty big so they took prob 25-30 min to bake (I kept checking on them). Absolutely awesome recipe, way better than store bought buns!!!",

I made the dough in a food processor and used less than 5 cups of flour. After looking at the dough with every flour addition I guessed that it was not going to come together in the \"ball\". I made and educated guess to stop adding flour and pour in the bowl to rise. It rose beautifully! I dipped the measuring cup in flour and floured my hands too before rolling it out. I heated the water and processed the \"buns\" like baking bagels...not just a quick dip. These came out perfect...my kids gobbled them up and requested the rolls for their lunchboxes! I am glad I used less flour and mixing because more would have yielded tough rolls. I made larger rolls (that had to be cut in half...they were more like mini-loaves) but next time I will make them smaller (like hamburger/slider size). You can shape the rolls...just take your time and keep your hands/counter floured. Mine were tied in cool knots! This recipe is a keeper! Thank you \"Brittsky\"!!!...my kids thank you too!",

Nevertheless, I added it at the end and the buns came out beautiful.  \nA couple of comments:   6\" log isn't really long enough.  I would say 8-10\" if you want to do any type of spiral.\n\"Dipping\" the buns into the water & baking soda is not as easy as it seems if you want to keep the spiral shape.  I used a perforated spatula, but think any spatula would work.  Some of the buns had to be reshaped after their bath.  I made each bun 4 oz. each and they doubled in size while baking and were a healthy size when done.  Nothing was said about what to bake these on.  I used parchment paper and it worked well.",
