Ketchup 9 packets of Equal but left the garlic powder at 2 tbsp (seemed like a typo maybe & 2 tbsp was just right) and cooked four individually quick frozen chicken breasts in the sauce in the microwave. Then made \"Rice Bowls\" by cutting them into cubes and serving with lots of vegies on rice with the sauce poured over all - really delicious! Kids said they definitely want it again. Thank you!",

Microwave cooking has it's place in many homes for a variety of reasons. Cooking meat in the microwave is possible if care is taken to cook it in short increments or on a low setting. Many adults with disabilities would not be able to live a moderately independent life without the use of a microwave. It may take the same amount of time but doesn't require as much monitoring or remembering to turn things off which could end in damage injury or worse. Just saying!!",
