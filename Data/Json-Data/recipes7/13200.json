I did wish they were a bit crispier on the outside but the flavor more than makes up for that. I did check the original recipe from the submitter's personal file and I noticed that she listed oil in the ingredients but butter in the directions so I'm wondering if you were to use oil in the batter if that would make them crispier? Also keep an eye on them as they did not take 10 minutes to cook. In any case the family LOVED these and I will def be making them again YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Then I had to add almost 1/2 c more water in order to make it thin enough for the waffle iron. The cooking time is way too long - makes them really crunchy. The last couple I only cooked for a few minutes and we liked them better. I got 26 waffle squares out of these recipe",
