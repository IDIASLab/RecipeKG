Second time, I coated it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture before cooking followed by the butter and cinnamon coating. Wow! It's like Monkey bread or a cinnamon roll to go! It's very pretty, cheap, and simple. I will be keeping this recipe to pass on as a camping breakfast tradition. It was so much fun to make! Thanks for this delicious recipe!\n\nIf you want to make these at home because you are craving them but weather isn't permitting camping, follow the recipe but bake at temperature and time suggested on your biscuit can, rotating once half way through cook time.",
