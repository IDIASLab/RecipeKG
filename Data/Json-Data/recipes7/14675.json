I used to have an old recipe however I lost it many years ago so I looked to find a comparable one. The spices and ingredients are standard for other spice cakes. I really doubted the recipe when I stirred and folded it into my cake pan. It was quite thick. I thought the moisture from the tomatoes would improve it. The cake baked up in 45 minutes. The color was pale and unattractive. I was going to add walnuts however forgot and I am glad I didnt because it would have been drier. The texture was gummy and chewy. It did have a good flavor warm. I do not expect it to be ate by my sugar toothed husband.",
