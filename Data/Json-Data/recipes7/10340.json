I also made maple flavored buttercream frosting for the top with the left-over yogurt. I was concerned about not using an egg... and they came out tasting a lot like french toast - minus the normal consistency of a cupcake due to the lack of egg. Super soft and moist just bit crumbly. Very good recipe though and easy to modify!",
