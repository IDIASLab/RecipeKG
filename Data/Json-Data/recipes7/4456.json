I used a jalapeno and made it the day before I served it -- that was too long and the jalapeno made this salad too spicy for most people so next time I'll use anaheims or poblanos plus not make it that far ahead! The ginger was very much the odd man out here and many people made a face when they first tasted it probably because they don't taste it much but no one commented really. This was a good salad with a definite Asian flair. Thanks for the recipe!",
