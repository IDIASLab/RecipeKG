As we say here in Hawaii, \"Broke da mouth!\"  \n\nOnly thing I changed - Bake for about 50 minutes, then put foil over the edges and bake another 20-25 minutes. This way the center becomes more golden brown colored and crispy on top. (FYI, normally toward the center under the crispy coconut, the top will have a layer of \"squooshy goodness\", don't worry it IS cooked! Blame it on the butter..hehe. YUM!) Ohh and yes, I love it better on the 2nd day, but that's just a matter of personal preference I know others that like it fresh!\n\nETA: 4/17/2016 - Wow it's been almost 8 years since I've posted this review and I'd like to say this is still my go to recipe for butter mochi!",

I only had four but decided to go ahead anyway and it was TERRIBLE. the flavor was the same but the texture just wasn't there. it turned out mushy and not chewy at all.",
