                "reviewBody": "definitely will be making this again probably for guests next time! I typically don't post reviews when I've altered the recipe but because I think these alterations will make this recipe more accessible to more cooks I am going to share them. 1st Sorrel: Nowhere to be found where I live so googled possible substitutions. The recommended substitution was spinach and a little lemon juice. Since the recipe already called for a significant amount of lime juice I opted for spinach the called for lime juice and the zest off half the lime. The sauce was DELICIOUS. It will definitely be making multiple appearances at our table. 2nd: letting the tortilla dough rest an hour. I was surprised that the recipe didn't call for hot water to mix the dough which is definitely a very traditional part of making tortillas. So I heated my water to boiling before adding it and the melted butter to the flour mix. This meant I didn't need to let the dough rest it was ready to make into tortillas as soon as I had it portioned out. That said this became a very quickly moving recipe at that point. So if you want to take your time in the kitchen preparing the chicken onions and kale no reason why not to just follow the original instructions and let the dough rest.",

But it's still delicious! The home made tortillas are completely worth the effort if you pick up a tortilla press. We freeze half of the tortillas (put some parchment between each one) and make it again in a few weeks...so yummy!",

These were sooooo good and very easy to make. I made them ahead of time and as they were coming out of the pan me and the kids drizzled a few with honey cinnamon and sugar and scarfed those bad boys down. TASTY. I used near boiling hot water and made them right away as I was in a hurry. They turned out just fine. For the white sauce I sub'd Fage brand greek yogurt 2% because I sub that for sour cream in almost everything. I also added lime zest to it. White sauce was delectable on everything even the refried beans and 'Spanish Rice Original' (another bomb recipe from this site). Because...I make everything more complicated than need be lol I used the chicken recipe from Goya on this site 'Shredded Chicken tacos' and it was great. I plan to use this chicken next time because I love kale. No sensible reason why I didn't use it this time. I used Maseca for the tortillas. Will update when I make the chicken =)",
