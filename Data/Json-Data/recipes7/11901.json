Of course I ate some too, and we both agreed that they were rich, and that the contrasting salty and sweet flavors plus the combination of the soft center with the crunchy toasted nuts was perfect! I undercooked my caramel slightly so I didn't get the full caramel flavor but I now recognize that it was a fault of mine and not of the recipe so I definitely recommend trying this!",

I wanted to leave a tip in response to the first reviewer because I think perhaps the caramel may have been cooked too long because I've never had to wait 30 minutes for it to calm when adding the cream; maybe cooked to a different candy stage. My centers are rather soft and chocolatey with caramel flavor peaking through. I must admit mine don't always come out as nice as they did in my picture posted here lol. Working with candy can be a trial-and-error process I've had my share of fails and still do fail more often than I'd care to admit;) I do hope you'll give this another try as they're yummy and I just want to share them!",

                "reviewBody": "I've tried many types of truffle recipes for the holiday season for the past few years. I love the flavor combination of salt caramel and chocolate. The flavor of this recipe is delicious! It did not however turn out like the picture. As soon as I put the cream with the caramel it boiled up and took about 30 minutes to calm down and look like regular caramel. After it cooled down so much it was nearly impossible to mix in the chocolate. The consistency looks more like a crumbled up haystack instead of ganache. I will use this recipe again but I will change some things. 1. Make a caramel salt and pecan brittle beforehand let it cool then put it the food processor to add after ganache is done. 2. Make the ganache by heating the cream take the cream off heat then melt the chocolate in the cream. Add the brittle to the ganache at the end.",
