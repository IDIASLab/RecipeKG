I reduced the sugar to 2 tbsp and used dark brown sugar. I subbed flour for cornstarch just because I didn't have any cornstarch and I used apple cider vinegar for \"vinegar.\" I threw Ikea frozen meatballs in it and baked them for about 20 minutes at 450 (although I probably could have done 15 if my oven told me when it was preheated). It was the perfect amount of sauce for 1 bag of Ikea meatballs.:) This recipe was really a great jumping off point though! I think that the soy sauce mustard apple cider vinegar and dark brown sugar really made it. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used apple cider vinegar and I did add just a little seasoned salt to the meat. Oh and I used buffalo meat instead of ground beef and that worked out great too. I noticed I omitted the salt-- didn't need any I thought! And I did add about 1/2 C of instant wild rice to the meat as well. My 2 1/2 year old son loved them- wanted more!
