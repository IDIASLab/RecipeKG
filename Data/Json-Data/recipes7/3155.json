You cannot believe how moist and very chocolaty this is!!!! update: I had an extra can of coca-cola that needed a purpose and found a coca cola cake from this website and I believe in the mashed potato so much from THIS recipe that i basically combined the two recipes! you have got to try this recipe to believe it! I didn't even use fresh potatoes! I always have extra boxes of instant potato flakes because they are given to me and I never use them. Now I know they are great to bake with! Try it!!!!! By the way I want to try this without any chocolate at all just lots of vanilla and see if it is still great!",
