                "reviewBody": "We absolutely enjoyed these tarts!  They are actually on the sweet side!  Instead of packaged pie crusts I used my own basic pie crust recipe.  What worked really well is I have an old muffin pan that is not super deep.  Perfect size for these little tarts.  They were so simple to make.  The onion cooked up quickly.  I used half the butter as another reviewer said 1/2 cup was too much.  So 1/4 cup butter was perfect.   I refrigerated the filling overnight and when I went to assemble them, I took the filling out while I rolled dough and placed them in the muffin tin.  (I used a scalloped cutter for the crusts. It added a nice edge to the crusts). Also I have a little cookie scoop I used to place the filling in the crusts.  I ended up baking them longer than recommended as the filling wasn\u2019t quite done.  I took them out once the filling was bubbly.  \nWe had these with wine for a get together with friends and they enjoyed them.  \n\nI will definitely be making these again.",

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting Gruyere (would use again) for the mozzarella (none on hand).  The only negative I have is that I think there\u2019s waaaay too much butter in this recipe.  After I filled the tartlets, butter was pooling on the top of the onions.  When I took them out of the muffin tin, my fingers were coated with butter, and the bottoms of the muffin cups had a layer of butter sitting in them.  Next time, I definitely will start with half the amount in the recipe, and if needed, add a bit more.  On the positive, they taste absolutely divine, seriously, they\u2019re that good.  Also, very, very rich.  I\u2019ve had this recipe on my radar for quite some time, and I\u2019m glad I finally made it.  Jaime, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
