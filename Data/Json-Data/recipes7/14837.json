I'm positive this would have been better with fresh. If I were to use the reconstituted figs again I would cut them into teeny tiny pieces. The figs and the onions complement each other very well. I aimed for some in every bite. I wish I had put more feta on top than what was called for.",

A great and simple weeknight meal.",

Like the other reviewers the figs were an interesting addition that I did not particularly care for but omitting them made the recipe just fine in my book! What struck me was how easy it was to make. I was able to throw the entire meal together in about 20 minutes not including cooking time. Made it easy for me to get housework and homework done while everything was cooking. And the Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes were a great and easy way to make mashed potatoes without the hassle of peeling and chopping regular potatoes. Highly recommend them to anyone and everyone!",

They are a delicious substitute for when you don't have time to prepare homemade ones (what I usually do.) The meatloaf however none of us four liked it. I did substitute feta with mozzarella but that was not the issue. The figs were too sweet and mixed with the onion cheese and meat there was too much going on in each bite. We'd definitely eat the Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes again but not the meatloaf.",
