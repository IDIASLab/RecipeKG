I used unsweetened coconut which was a wise choice. It would have been way too swee otherwise. I love the flavors of cinnamon and almond in here. The outside texture is a crisp meringue shell almost and the inside is a chewy coconut macaroon. I love it!",

I put them in for 12 more minutes on 250 and they turned out great. Macaroons are supposed to be crunchy anyways. The almond extract adds an excellent flavor and the cinnamon doesn't distract from the coconut taste at all. Highly recommended.",

I thought it would be a disaster but I went ahead and tried to subsititute the remaining measurement with finely chopped almonds. I also didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla. And I had to adjust the cooking temp and times probably because of my mistakes. Oh yeah I also didn't have parchment paper so I used foil:) BUT...I was so pleasantly surprised that they actually came out GOOD! So all this is to say that you can really botch up these cookies and they will still turn out! Next time I'll try to make the cookies as directed and see what they're supposed to taste like but just know that if you don't have the exact ingredients or measurements they'll probably still come out ok!! Good luck!",
