This cake turned out very dry.  The frosting makes no sense --- butter and powdered sugar?  It tasted like, well, loads of butter & sugar.  Very strange recipe.  So I doctored that up quite a bit, adding baking cocoa to make a chocolate frosting.  I don't know if that is a misprint, but be aware if you are making this.  Just use your own frosting recipe.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan; did not have additional time to frost a 3-layer cake.",
