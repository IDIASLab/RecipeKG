After cooking and Draining the Farro I added the Milk Vanilla beans and Sugar (i used 4 teaspoons) right back into the Farro Pot and continued to cook on low for another 8 minutes. I Mixed the sugar and vanilla beans together so the beans would separate nicely.Also added a splash of pure vanilla. The Milk part of this tastes wonderful and i really didnt mind the Farro..but the Farro itself really has no flavor which makes everything kind of bland.. I wonder if you soaked the Farro in water with sugar and vanilla overnight..if it would pick up any of that flavor.",

I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drizzle of maple syrup to my bowl after eating a few spoonfuls of the original recipe and it's better. Farro is such a thick hearty grain it seems like it would be hard to flavor it. Maybe if it was cooked like rice pudding it would have more sweetness and flavor. Thank you.",

I sprinkled with cinnamon sugar which made it a little tastier we enjoyed the chewiness of the farro which I soaked for 12 hours. I would recommend 2 tbsps of sugar not 2 tsps. I remember my grandmother making wheat berries when I was a child she used honey and dried fruit that may be a nice addition to this recipe.",

Instead of cooking in plain water I cooked it in coconut milk. As the recipe indicated in another saucepan I cooked the remaining coconut milk raw sugar instead of white and vanilla beans/seeds. I am very happy I only used 1/2 cup of farro because it was just okay even after the alteration of cooking the grain in coconut milk. I'd rather use quinoa pudding recipe on this site over farro as a breakfast cereal. Sorry just not my cup of tea!",
