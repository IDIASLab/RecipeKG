The main problem is that it was overly sweet - the suggested amount of sugar is too much in my opinion. I like well balanced sweet/savory dishes but this tasted like a dessert! Also the sugar/mayo mixture was too thick and the raisins added even more to the sweetness of the dish. All in all it is an interesting idea but the final result was a disappointment. I really wish I could rate it better.",
