Since I like a sweeter banana bread I added an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also upped the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Definitely spray your pan with cooking spray so it doesn't stick. I sprinkled the top with additional chopped walnuts before popping it into the oven for about 45 mintues. The bread smelled wonderful and rose very nicely. Absolutely delicious and perfect with a piping hot cup of tea!",
