Also I used just 1 Tbsp of raw sugar (I think the recipe called for a lot more sugar. This was plenty!) I didn't have poppy seeds so that got left out. I assembled this and refrigerated it for maybe 30 minutes and that was enough. Not sure why they say to chill it for longer. Not necessary. This came out excellent! I can't give it five stars with white vinegar in the recipe but I give it four because they gave me the base for MY five star salad!",
