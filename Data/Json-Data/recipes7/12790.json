I added a little bit of cinnamon and sugar into the batter itself (like some others recommended) It wasn't too sticky and rolled out perfect. I had a hard time fitting 18 rolls into my pan though. I think next time I would try to make 12 or so and see if they rise up more. I will definitely make this again!",

I didnt make any changes, except when I was stirring the mix, since many people said the dough can be sticky, it happened for me too but for the dough not to be sticky you just add more flour (like a spoon or two) and keep mixing it with your hands until you think its good enough to be rolled with a roll pin and not stick. Mine didnt stick anymore and was perfect. Also i made the mixture of 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar with cinnamon, but I personally didnt need to use all of that as it was a lot. Other than that, followed all instructions and it turned out amazing, soft and brilliant for breakfast!",

Rolled dough into balls,  layered in a bunt pan.   Mixed sugar, butter, cinnamon together. First put a layer of dough, dribbled sugar mix and sprinkled raisins and walnuts, continued with layers until done.  Baked about 10 to 15 minutes longer, cooled then turned out onto a plate.
