Or even the smaller ones that you have 24 of them hanging around.  DO NOT skip the step of salting the cucumbers and letting them rest.  Mine sat for about 3 hours before I used them and I was amazed at how much water the salt pulled from them.  The taste and texture is a lot like zucchini bread.  I baked mine in 5 - 3 1/2\" x 6\" pans, 2 without pecans and 3 with pecans.  They were done in 38 minutes.  I have 2 more cukes on my counter that I'm baking 10 mini loaves to freeze.  My DS loved this and wants to take a few back to school with him.  Our favorite way to eat this bread is toasted with a thin layer of butter (the guys) dry (for me) for breakfast.  Thanks Marcella for posting this recipe - it is a keeper!",

I made my batch a little bigger (3 large loaves), added some shredded zucchini and ground flaxseed and put in a little less sugar than the recipe stated. A little healthier for you and it still tasted great. This is a great way to use all the extra cukes in your garden that you can't get around to eat or pickling.",

Or maybe since I blended my cukes in my Ninja I ended up with more per cup? Anyway the little ones liked it and I found that toasted with butter I could eat it. The cucumber flavor is very strong and hangs around. Since I have a lot of cukes from a friend's garden I will try this again but reduce the amount of cucumber and see how that works.",
