This is really an appropriate cookie with fall around the corner.  It\u2019s substantial and hearty, packed with flavor and abundant with nuts, cherries and chocolate.  I added nothing the recipe didn\u2019t call for.  I left out nothing the recipe was meant to include, and that was a good call.  The recipe is perfect as written, WITH the cherries, WITH the nuts (if you tolerate them), both pecans and walnuts, and WITH the almond extract, which enhances the cherry flavor.  Other than using the chocolate chips I had on hand rather than chocolate chunks, I didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  However, watch your baking time carefully!  I set my timer for the minimum of 11 minutes suggested, and while the cookies didn\u2019t necessarily suffer for it, they still were a little browner than I would have liked.  A minute or two less would have been just right.",

Delicious! I had some dried cherries in the freezer, so I put them in a bowl with a splash of water, gave it a stir and microwaved until they were thawed. I baked a tray without nuts and two with.
