These cookies have dark chocolate, molasses, cloves, cinnamon and coffee.  They're soft, chewy, best when warm, and delicious.  It brings back good memories of my childhood.",

                "reviewBody": "Great cookies! My family loved them! I only made a couple minor changes: - since I don't like baker's chocolate I used 2.5 regular 100g bars of Hershey's Dark Chocolate. - changed 1.5 cups of sugar to 1 cup I found it was easier to blend the dough using a spoon and then a hand mixer and I controlled the texture with the amount of coffee I poured in instead of adding more flour. For Icing: I found 2 table spoons of cream is not enough at all so I added quite a bit more till it mixed well and had smooth texture but wasn't runny (used hand mixer once again) and added lemon extract instead of vanilla extract for that added flavour. If you have icing in a deep bowl it's easy to just dip the cookies in there instead of spreading it on them. I made half a batch with icing and another half withouth. They taste awsome with jam too! Thank you Madeleine for a wonderful recipe!",

Plus I added almost 8 cups of flour before the dough was sticky enough to roll into a ball. Also the longer these cookies sit around the harder they get. Not a recipe I would make again.",
