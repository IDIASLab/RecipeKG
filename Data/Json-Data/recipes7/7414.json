It's a nice change but the amount of cinnamon and spices even though I like the flavor felt like it left a coating on my tongue and tasted overcooked. My cranberries cooked in about 12 minutes and next time I make this I will cut back at least the cinnamon to 1.5 teaspoons (to start) and add the spices when I add the apples. I could see adding orange zest to this too. (recipe made for RECIPE GROUP ).",
