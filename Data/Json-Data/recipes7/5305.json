Once you've had it, you'll love making it.  There are only a few recipes for this pie and it took me years of tweaking other recipes to come up with one that actually makes an edible bean pie. This recipe you can trust to make an awesome dessert.",

I didn't have a food processor so I put the ingredients in a blender instead. The tops of both of my pie crusts burned a little bit, so when I try this again, I think I will follow the advice of a couple other reviewers and bake at 350 for an 1:10. My pies didn't have the deep, dark color that I was expecting (they were light tan). However, the taste was still good. The secret, I found, was letting the pies refrigerate overnight. By the next day, their color had deepened AND the flavors seemed even richer and tastier than they'd been the day before. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! It's definitely going to become a regular in my house!",

I actually use 3 cans of beans now and increse all the other ingredients accordingly because I like my pie crust to be full to the brim. I then also have to ccok it a little longer. We use to get bean pies in the city of Baltimore but we now live an hour away so I was looking to try to make my own and this recipe is perfect. People think a \"bean pie\" does not sound like it would be good and are always pleasanytly surprised when they try it. I usually say it is similar to a sweet potato pie. If you like sweet potato pie you will probably like this recipe. Great with a little whipped cream or cool whip. Thanks for posting.",
