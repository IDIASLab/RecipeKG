Bob's Red Mill also carries Xanthan Gum, it's pricey but you use so little the 8oz package will last a very long time.",

As soon as I mixed my wet and dry ingredients the batter turned into one boulder of goo. I bet I added 3 cups of milk AND a third egg to get semi-workable batter. I still had to use the back of a spoon to help it spread on the griddle to cook sufficiently. The result tastes okay. I will try without any added xanthum gum next time and probably add a tsp vanilla.",
