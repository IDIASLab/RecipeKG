Hands down the best blueberry muffin recipe I have ever made, and threw away the other 10 recipes I had in my binder.  I ended up making 2 batches because the first one disappeared so quickly.  I don't know if it is the same thing but this recipe called for table creamer which I did not have but I did have heavy whipping cream and used that instead.  Also, in the second batch I added a tablespoon of lemon juice and well, it was just as amazing as the first batch.  This needs to be tried by everyone!",

They did take a little longer to bake, 20 minutes.   That whipped cream cheese is an ingredient I've not before seen in blueberry muffins, and maybe that's what makes them special??   Don't know, just know they were a total hit in this house.   Giulyfafuly, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
