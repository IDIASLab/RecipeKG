I've made it three times now,  first two times used white cake mix and strong coffee and instant coffee powder respectively, as I couldn't find the Espresso Powder. This cake always turns out well, but by far my best result has been this third time, when I used a Betty Crocker Supermoist French Vanilla cake mix, and finally, the Espresso powder,  which gives it an unsurpassed depth of flavour.  I recommend to follow this recipe as written, and to not substitute any of the ingredients.",
