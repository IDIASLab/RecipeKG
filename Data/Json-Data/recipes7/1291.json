However I had made some changes to the recipe (due to time and lack of ingredients) and thought I would probably change some things in the future. I used dried cranberries not fresh. I candied the cranberries and sugar in a pot on the stove rather than in the oven. I added the jam to the pot and then once that was mixed together I added the cream cheese (the recipe didn't state when to add the cream cheese). It really changed the consistency and flavor of the cream cheese big time and I ended up adding another 4 oz of it to give it a bit more of that flavor. I think in the future I would still do the cranberries the same (but use probably 1/4 cup sugar) but let the mixture cool before adding the cream cheese.",
