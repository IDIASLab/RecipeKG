I suspect it has to do with the heat but that's tricky; too low and it stays soft too high and it burns (ask me how I know). I'm probably going to experiment a little bit to see if I can get a more consistent product. The taste is great but I'd like to make the texture perfect too. Because I burned the first one I turned the heat way down. I have an electric range though and it can be difficult to get good control. I ended up keeping the heat just a bit below medium to keep mine from burning but they were still soft. I'll post again if I can get this to be perfect.

I used a flat griddle on medium-low heat and allowed them to slowly brown. They were a little tricky to flip the first time and then they were golden brown I draped them over the bottoms of wine and custard glasses. They hardened fairly quickly within a couple of minutes. I did burn a couple of fingertips in the process of trying to pick them up when turning because I needed to get my spatula underneath. Tip To shape them over a bowl or glass place a paper towl over the hot waffle cone so you can touch it and hold it in place as you shape the cup as you need. Hold for a minute until it cools and remove the paper towel.",

Take the warm waffle lay it on a towel then wrap it around a cone form and leave on the form until cool. The ingredients are PERFECT it's just a matter of mastering the technique!

                "reviewBody": "The end product was tasty, but the recipe could use a couple tweaks to get the crispiness everyone expects in a waffle-cone.  First of all, the recipe says it makes 8 cones, but it's actually closer to 5 cones based on the 1/4th cup of batter per cone.  You need to scale the recipe up if you want 8.  Next the recipe calls for cooking over medium heat.  This browns the waffles too quickly and you'll end up with soft and pliable cones.  If you want it firm up properly then you'll need to drop the temperature down a little.  Everyone's stove is different, but based on the reviews it seems like those that had success used a medium-low temperature.  In my case, I set the temperature knob to 5 o'clock (assuming 6 o'clock is medium). And my last suggestion is to make sure your work area is ready to go.  You want to be able to quickly form the cone as soon as it is off the griddle, otherwise the edges will start cracking on you.",
