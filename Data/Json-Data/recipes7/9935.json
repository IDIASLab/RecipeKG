It's my adaptation of the perfect nut-free trail cookie that's been our family's favorite chewy oatmeal cookie for 10 years. Loaded with choco-chips and dried cranberries. The flax seed meal and pumpkin seeds give them a nutty taste, without the nuts. Perfect for school kids or those with allergies.",

I had to hide half the batch because the first batch was gone within hours. Only change I made was to leave out the white sugar. We tend not to use it and didn't miss it at all. As I reported in my first review before this was published I was afraid there was not enough moisture in the wet ingredients to handle the dry but it was not a problem at all. They were very moist cookies. Wooden spoon was required! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing WCM!",

Since I have made this recipe a couple of times now, I too the suggestion of the submitter and added 1/2 cup of Whole wheat flour in place of the entire 1 1/2 cups of white flour.\nI cannot say enough how awesome this cookie is and now all my family and friends are enjoying it too.

I followed the recipe except I used a mixed berry blend I chopped some and for the chocolate I used milk chocolate chips I had in the house. Only change I would make is cut the coconut in half or leave it out. However that is mainly because I am just not a fan of coconut personally. The base is really versatile though. I could even see adding the nuts if allergies are not a concern. I am sure my husband will love these when he tries them this evening. I got 3 dozen with half the recipe.

I left out the coconut because I was out of it and instead of a full cup of chocolate chips I added 1/2 cup chocolate and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. I had to use my KA Mixer instead of the wooden spoon to incorporate all the ingredients which worked perfect because the batter is very dense. I got 4 dozen cookies.

I had to make 3 changes based on what I had at home. 1) light brown sugar because my dark is hard as a rock 2) sunflower seeds rather than pumpkin and 3) because I made these during Lent and I gave up chocolate I made the cookies with cinnamon chips. We loved these cookies. I made them to take on vacation and DH kept eating them and taking them to a friend at work. I finally hid them in the freezer. We really like the taste of the cinnamon chips in this cookie and I would probably use them again. Thanks westcoastmom for sharing your fabulous recipe. I know I will be making this one again!",
