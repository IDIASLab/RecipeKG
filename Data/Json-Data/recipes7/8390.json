Just by adding something cold, sweet and a little crispy is a wonderful compliment to color and texture on your plate.  I make up this recipe or another very like it, put it all in a jar, seal it and serve it throughout the week, probably 2 or 3 times. Not really as a side dish but more as a garnish, it's just that little something extra that adds a bit of difference and shows that you care.",
