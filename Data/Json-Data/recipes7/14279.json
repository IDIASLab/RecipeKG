The important thing is to get those apples nice and brown...like the color of French fries. This gave it a strong fried apple flavor. It took double the time for my apples to brown, but it was worth the wait. The browned butter gave it a nice deep flavor also. I made it exactly as written except I used fat free cream cheese which is probably why my dip isn't as fluffy and creamy looking as the Allrecipes photo. But it was still so VERY good!",
