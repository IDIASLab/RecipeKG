They rose just enough to turn into muffins.  and because they were muffins they were much harder to remove from the pan.  Which WAS generously greased.  Second.  The recipe makes no mention of whether or not to let them cool before starting the dipping process.  These are surprisingly fragile, they fell apart just getting them out of the pan, much less dipping in butter, etc.   tasted good, but I got maybe 8 successfully done.  Oh, and no mention of quantity....basically a half, ahem, recipe..",
