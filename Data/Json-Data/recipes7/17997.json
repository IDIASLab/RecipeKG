FYI to others mine baked for 13 minutes. That aside these are really good cookies and I think you could successfully substitute other nuts (pecan comes to mind) if you can t find hazelnuts in your area although they were very good. I used my mini chopper which came with my immersion blender on the nuts and these cookies certainly are quick and easy. I particularly like the sweet flavor from the brown sugar. We enjoyed these cookies and I definitely would make again.",
