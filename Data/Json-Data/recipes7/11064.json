When cooking I was concerned that they were thick and not fluffy. But the taste was so good. They are very rich; I couldn't eat as many as I do with regular pancakes. My toddler loved them too. The only change I made to the recipe was to use ground flax instead of seeds. Actually I just looked up Chef Jacob's personal recipe for these and he said \"flax meal \" which would be ground flax. So I guess I didn't really change the recipe.",
