I also used oats instead of potato flakes (they didn't need to be chopped up- they just melt into the dough).  Another thing I altered was that I used all water.  In my experience, breads made with milk get tough quickly and aren't that good unless they're super fresh.  Makeing it with all water keeps it fresher longer.  But these were wonderful!

We loved the onion flavor of these rolls so much that I will never buy them from the bakery again. I made one small change to the recipe since I do not have dried onions on hand and that was to saut\u00e9 about 1/4 cup worth of onions to get the moisture out and they worked out fine every time. I also don\u2019t have a bread machine which is simply to proof the yeast and only start out with 1 \u00bd to 2 cups of flour and knead in the last cup. Knead for the standard 8 or so minutes and let rise, covered, in a warm place for an hour or more and then follow recipe from step 2. They are Easy to make without a bread machine and Mmmmm are they sooooo good!",

Even the shaping step was simple and I'm not a baker per se (which is the reason I waited so long to try these...). Made these to serve w/  slow cooker French dips (lonwolf32). I'm used to French dips on crusty bread, but as it turns out, onion rolls are an excellent substitue! I pretty much followed claudygirl's directions to the letter except for 3 (minor) changes. Not wanting tough rolls, I used all H2O. I also flash fried 1/4 c. of fresh, finely choped onion instead of using the dried minced variety in my topping mixture (I added dried onion to my dough, but didn't have enough left for the topping also). Finally, I added about an 1/8 c. of poppyseeds to my topping. The popular St. Rosen's brand onion rolls include poppyseeds in theirs, so I decided to do the same! :) NOTE: This recipe yeilds 1 lb. worth of dough. My bread machine users manual includes several recipes, one of which is an rye onion roll recipe. The 8 roll yeild instructs to chose the 1 lb. loaf setting. Additionally, your liquid should be no cooler than 98 degrees F & no warmer than 105 F to be considered \"lukewarm.\" Oh, and be SURE to increase the amount of yeast to 2.5 t as claudy's top review suggests. Doing so will yield a batch of perfectly risen rolls! I'm SOOOO glad to have given these a try. These were FANTASTIC fresh & just as good the next day! This recipe will be added to my keeper file for sure. Thanks for sharing, claudygirl! :-)",

I shrugged my shoulders and popped the rolls in the oven anyway, and they ended up puffing up nicely while cooking.  So despite all my worries, they turned out perfectly!  I didn't have any dried minced onion, so I put fresh minced onion inside the dough.  I flash-fried some more fresh minced onion in very hot oil for a few seconds until it was golden and put this on top of the rolls before baking.  The flash-fried onions were a flavorful addition.  Great recipe!  We had BBQ beef sandwiches on these rolls.",

I make fresh bread every day so I'm not a novice. The dough seemed good mixing it up but not happy with the end result. (I used fresh onion and sauteed it like others.) I think I'll try adding onion to one of our other recipes to create an onion bread for my husband who has been asking.",
