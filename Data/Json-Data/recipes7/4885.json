She wasn't kidding about the coconut extract really being the money flavor in these muffins. Holy frijoles, was that GOOD! And I'll tell you, using whole wheat flour and cutting back on the sugar didn't affect the flavor AT ALL. NOTE: I got 12 medium-large muffins out of this recipe. 350* for 20 minutes was just right for muffins. If you want to avoid a rubbery loaf/muffin, I suggest you wisk together the dry ingredients in one bowl, then wisk together all the wet and lightly fold the wet ingredients into the dry. This way, you don't overwork your ingredients and don't end up with a \"rubbery\" muffin.",
