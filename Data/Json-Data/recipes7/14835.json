                "reviewBody": "The family really enjoyed this meal. 4 chicken breasts butterflied and pounded thin will yield 8 rolls. My breasts were about a 1 pound each I used 2 breasts making 4 rolls about 1/2 lb each. The cream cheese filling is enough for 4 rolls not 8. I didn't have whipped cream cheese so I used regular cream cheese and whipped it with a mixer. I did add some finely chopped chives to the cream cheese in addition to the other ingredients. I sprinkled the breasts with chicken seasoning (salt pepper garlic powder paprika cayenne) instead of just salt and pepper. As for the sauce I added a little fresh garlic to the olive oil before adding the cream. 4 oz of fresh basil is lot I used about 6 large leaves and that was just right. The Idahoan Russet potatoes were very good much better than we expected. I made as directed while the chicken rested just adding a tad of butter to each serving. This would be great for when you need a nice dinner fast make the chicken rolls in advance wrap each tightly in plastic wrap make the sauce while the chicken cooks steam a vegetable and dinner is ready in 30 minutes. (Note: Partially freezing the chicken breasts makes it very easy to butterfly them and pound flat.)",

Substitutions: 1) used thinly sliced chicken breast 2) used ricotta cheese 3) also used mexican shredded cheese 4) breasts seasoned with monterey chicken seasoning & season all as we like our food seasoned. Will look great on elegant dinnerware next time and i will add asparagus. Will also make trays for the sick and shut-in-- definitely exudes comfort food.",
