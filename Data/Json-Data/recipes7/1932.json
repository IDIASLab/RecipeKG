                "reviewBody": "I was looking for a recipe for my Norwegian S/O who was feeling a little homesick and this was closest recipe in English to what his family makes. I did make a couple changes-For the dough, I used about 2/3 of a cup of sugar and I mixed in about a tsp of cardamom with the flour and salt. I added the flour about a half cup at a time, and after the first cup, I started mixing with a rubber spatula. IMO, when you don't have a stand mixer to do the work for you, this is the best way to get the ingredients mixed evenly. For the custard, I used three egg yolks instead of the regular eggs, and mixed all the ingredients before heating. When making the buns, I separated the dough into the 6 pieces(the S/O kept emphasizing how huge the roles were supposed to be) and then rolled each ball out to a quarter inch thick. I was able to put about 2 tbsp of custard in there, which is important, because I've heard if you don't have enough it can just bake into the bread. And then after I folded them together, I let them rise again for about a half hour. for the topping, I made a simple icing with powdered sugar and water, dipped the tops of the buns in it once they were cool, and then dipped them in finely shredded coconut. ANYWAY the result was awesome, and most importantly, my S/O was able to feel a little bit of home away from home. Thanks for posting!",
