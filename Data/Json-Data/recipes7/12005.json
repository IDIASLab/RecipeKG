I compared the two recipes and they were almost identical EXCEPT for the baking soda and cream of tartar.  My usual recipe does not have those two ingredients . \nWhat a difference these two make.  The cookies did not spread and they seem lighter in taste.  This is my new favorite recipe.  A hint for bakers to roll cookie dough.  Roll between two  sheets of PARCHMENT paper right after mixing.  You can use long dowel rods 1/4\" on each side of your parchment. paper to get perfect thickness cookies.  I use perfection sticks purchased on line for this purpose. The sticks come in three thicknesses for different doughs. Refrigerate  sheets of dough until cold. Cut out your cookies and move to baking sheet while cold.  You can reroll the cookie dough .  WAX PAPER does NOT work for rolling the dough.",

The only change I made was that I needed a bit more flour, so I used about 1/4 cup extra, and that was perfect. Oh, and I didn't measure the vanilla, but I think I used closer to 1 tsp (the more the better, IMO). The dough was super easy to work with, but if you think it's a little too soft, just throw it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, and that should do the trick. I've made lots and LOTS of cut out/sugar cookies, and this recipe is one of the best that I've tried. I halved the recipe and got 26 cookies, which is perfect for us. They did not spread, which was something I was worried about, so YAY!!!! They did puff a bit, but once they began to cool, they settled back down. This recipe was just what I was looking for...simple to make, easy to roll, kept their beautiful shape and were tender, buttery goodness. I will def be using this recipe...A LOT~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

In fact this recipe is very similar to hers (hers had a bit more flower and salt). Definitely chill at least 4 hours if it is kind of warm outside. I went overnight and had to re-chill the dough before rolling out a second time. These resulted in a crisp cookie (the thinner rolled ones) and the slightly thicker puffed up nicely.
