I try not to deviate from recipes when I first make them in order to truly evaluate them properly. I took the recipe submitter's suggestion and added in slices of fresh jalape\u00f1o (about half a pepper). At first I thought they would turn out too spicy, but when I tried them the next day, there was no heat at all. Next time I'll just use the whole pepper, sliced.  I'll definitely make these again!",
