Made exactly as written (except for using mini choco. chips b/c that's all I had) and would not change a thing. They smelled fantastic while baking and had great texture and flavor. As a lover of the chocolate/coconut combo I knew these were gonna be good but they are not just good they are fantastic and downright addicting lol! I did put some extra candies on top before baking and they cracked so I may put them on after baking next time so they are prettier. Me and the little guy had a lot of fun making these though I think he had more fun eating the candies lol. These cookies are definitely going into my favorite cookies file. Thanks Bug for sharing this wonderfully yummy recipe!:)",

I followed the recipe exactly my only advise is double triple or quadruple this recipe as the single batch is simply not enough!!! I doubled and made 24 large size cookies. As always I make dough balls and place on a baking tray in the freezer once frozen (About 20-30 minutes) I remove from the tray and store in zip lock bags. When required bake at 350 for approx 25 minutes. The perfect crackled cookie every time. NOTE I did struggle to find the almond joy pieces in my local grocery stores but eventually found them for sale at Target. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!",
