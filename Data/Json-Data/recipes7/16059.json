I used minced garlic instead of the powder and a can of diced tomatoes - I wasn't about to stick my hand in a can of tomatoes to break them up. And I used 2 cups of shredded cheddar - other than exceptions I followed the recipe exactly. It's pretty tasty and while I don't know if I'll make it again it was a good one to try. One extra comment - it needs more salt and pepper and/or other spices. It freezes and reheats well.",
