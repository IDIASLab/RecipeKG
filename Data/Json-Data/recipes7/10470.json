                "reviewBody": "The 1st time I made this I loved the flavor of the crust...that hands down is really good! Then came the mousse it was very strong and overpowering with peanut flavor. I felt I followed it to a T but after 2 hours in the frig....it was flopping and wouldn't hold shape very well after I cut into slices. And felt this should be freezer style pie. But if set up over night it held way better. Having said that I made it a 2nd time. One I didn't care for the peanuts in the pie rather it be sprinkled on top as a garnish...just my feeling on that. 2nd needs a FULL 8oz package of cream cheese because it needed to be thicker and I did add the additional cream cheese on the 2nd round to accommodate that adjustment. 3rd at 1st I thought there was too much whip topping in the mouse because it didn't hold up very well the 1st time. But after rethinking on the 2nd round the whip topping really needed to be very stiff so if you chose to use a non-dairy prepared whip topping....might not be a good idea. I made sure my whip topping was stiff enough and when I added it to the 2nd batch it help so well it was really ready to slice and go. Having made the changes with the additional cream cheese then making sure my whip topping was very stiff and leaving out the peanuts....I found I totally loved the recipe. Will make it again with my modifications.",

I used 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese and reduced the butter. Used Cool whip free instead of the whipped cream. It was still very tasty but a little less of a guilty pleasure. I refrigerated it overnight. It held together beautifully even after sitting at room temp for a significant amount of time. With my changes the filling took on more of a cheesecake texture but we were fine with it. I will be making this again in the future with all my changes.",

I also cut the peanut butter in the filling in 1/2 and I made my own whipped cream. I did not like the peanuts in the pie. I would omit them if I made this again. I made this in the food processor which made quick work of mixing everything together so the filling wasn't grainy from the sugar but even with cutting down the peanut butter by 1/2 I felt this was very peanut buttery so I made a chocolate sauce and that helped tremendously! The pie held its shape nicely after spending a few hours in the fridge and topped with chocolate sauce and homemade whipped topping we were able to cut down on the strong peanut butter flavor and enjoy it. If you love peanut butter this is the pie for you!",

I omitted peanuts in the filling and sprinkled some on top as the only modification. I whipped the cream until it was very stiff as shown in the video. This helped the pie hold together better since only 4oz of cream cheese was used. We loved the lighter mousse texture this created instead of the cheesecake density produced by 8oz of cream cheese. This is my new favorite recipe.",
