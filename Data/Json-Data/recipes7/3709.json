I'm not sure what happened since other reviews seem so positive but there was just way too much vinegar; it actually made my husband feel ill after eating and I double-checked the amount again after making the beans and I did put in what was called for. I myself couldn't eat more than two bites because it was so heavy on the vinegar and I just didn't like the flavors. So I don't know how but I feel like I must have made a mistake somewhere given the numerous positive reviews. Therefore I'm giving this two stars even though what I made turned out almost inedible. I really did want to like this and again I'm sorry to give it a low rating. But I guess I eat plenty of things other people find unappealing so to each his own!",

Due to an interrupted cooking schedule I did the first two parts and had them waiting. At last after sauteeing the garlic and adding the green beans I was tempted to just throw in the sauce and heat all together but instead I reheated the sauce in the microwave. Glad I did because I like those little bits of garlic clinging cleverly to the green beans. My BF snarfed these up completely before even taking a bite of his wonderfully grilled fillet mignon! Nice recipe Patti! Thanks so much for sharing!",
