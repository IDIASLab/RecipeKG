The recipe is delicious and it truly wears the \"Classic\" name  well.  The first time around I made the recipe exactly as called for and it came out a little soupy even though it did thicken up after chilling it.  The flavor was great, there just didn't seem to be enough rice.  \n\nSecond time around I made it with a bit more rice, using 1/2 cup of rice to 1 1/3 cups of water (as stated on the Uncle Ben's box and used 1 1/4 Teaspoons of corn starch.  The result was exactly what I was looking for and this recipe is now in the book for us.  Thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "Uncle Ben's Classic Rice Pudding is indeed the classic rice pudding recipe, enjoyed by my adult family members. I remained true to the basic recipe, adding a few of my own touches. My friend , Barbara of Scherer Farms in Bandon, OR, an Ocean Spray (R) supplier, gifted me a bag of her luscious berries which I rehydrated in orange juice. (Grand Marnier or Triple Sec would be nice too) I also freshly ground cinnamon that paired well with the cranberries. The pudding was lush and creamy when warm but as is with cooled pasta and rice, the custard was totally absorbed making the consistency dense and heavy, yet still very tasty. If serving this pudding cold, I'd recommend decreasing the rice to 1/4 cup. By consensus, everyone agreed that the servings should be 6 ounces rather than 8 ounces. It was too generous a serving after a big meal. Thank you Uncle Ben's Converted Rice, and thanks to my family for this delicious opportunity!",
