Definitely cook it until its done all the way through else you'll end up with an eggy taste (that was on my end for pulling it out too soon - impatient!) My husband said he'd love for me to prepare this again (although I may try it without the raisins):) Thanks for the great recipe!",

When I attempted the recipe I made it a little too thick and if I were to attempt this again I would certainly use a smaller pan size and I would possibly cook it longer. But the flavors were all great! I reheated some this morning for breakfast before work in my toaster oven and sprinkled some sugar on it and that made it even better. What I liked the most about it was that I couldn't even tell there wasn't any \"real\" milk in it! Lactaid was a great substitute here and made for a very good recipe. While it wasn't my favorite thing I've ever made with some tweaks I think I'd gladly make it again.",
