My DH really enjoyed it. I used buttermilk in place of the soured milk as I had some on hand. I really enjoyed the frosting. I did omit the coconut and the pecans as DH wanted just plain frosting. The cake is very good and a nice use for blackberries.",

Cooking time was a bit longer, also switched out spices for all spice and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond and vanilla. \nThank you for sharing this!",
