This bread is found in the cuisines of the Balkans and Turkey. So I searched high and low for a great bread to bake for my homemade panini. I tried maybe a dozen bread recipes over the years just to get it right. I needed a bread that was light and airy that you could press using a panini press and wouldn't get too hard to chew or too thick to eat.",

So the night before I made up the dough up to the first rising and popped it into the fridge overnight. The next day I took it out after returning home from work and took it through the next steps letting it rise a little longer since the dough was cold. Made it into 6 rolls instead of 5. They turned out just as expected -great texture inside and out and a great flavor. Will definitely make them again!",
