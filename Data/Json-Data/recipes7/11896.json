Great with organic oat nut bread! Also used cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to make it more like apple pie, and cut down the butter because you really don't need that much. Will probably cut the sugar just a bit next time, or use molasses instead. Awesome recipe! :-)",

I only made very minor changes, using gluten-free challa instead of the French bread, and Fuji apples instead of Granny Smith (that's what I had on hand) which I chopped in the food processor with the skins on instead of peeling and dicing. I let it sit in the refrigerator for about an hour before baking, so that all the liquids could soak into the bread really well. The texture and flavor were fantastic, and I'll be making this again.",

Definitely use Granny Smith or another firm baking apple that will stand up to skillet and then oven, and don't chop the apple too small or it will get lost. I used half of a 16-oz Italian bread loaf (bakery style, not sliced sandwich loaf). Also I used less cream and increased milk with good results. This made a slightly thin layer in a 9x13 pan so I would not recommend anything larger.  For even more deliciousness, next time I will add add walnuts or pecans. Thanks for the recipe!",
