On new years day we eat the \"left overs\"as breakfast or even as lunch. Besides oliebollen we make appelflappen sliced apples with cinnamon and sugar in a dough Oil balls is the name becuase they look like balls baked in oil. On the oliiebollen you pour sugarpouwder (a lot) not normal sugar. You can also make them with out raisin or apple offically oliebollen are without raisin and rozijnenbollen/raisenballs are with. But most people make them with Real Dutch is to pour beer and milk in the dough and not eggs and water. For 41/2 cups flour I use about 1 bottle of beer (330 ml) and 3 or 4 cups of handwarm milk 2 apples shopped 2 cups of raisins 2-3 spoons of sugar. 2 packages of yeast teaspoon salt. Put it all together until the dough is in a thick ribbon running of your spoon and the it double it size when it rest We bake them in a pan filled with oil 2-3 ltr. I use a pan that can keep the temprature on 180 degrees C and bake for a few hours",

To fully enjoy the taste of the apples you should use sour apples. According to this recipe the raisins are optional but they're actually standard ingredients (in Holland). Also try canned pineapple for a sweeter result. Or rum-raisins to give it a little kick.",
