Other than that I followed the recipe as written. The salad was good and different but the dressing just didn t work for me! As written it was way too tart and I ended up remaking it using 1 T. of vinegar along with 3 T. of oil which is a standard vinaigrette. I ended up using 3 T. of mayonnaise to make it to our liking. The dressing I made ended up being ok and we did use it but I doubt that I ll be making it again.",
