WRONG. This was incredible. My husband could not stop raving about this dessert. Apricots are not our favorite fruit but with this recipe they very well could become our fave! I am not overstating how good this was. I hate it when people change and modify a recipe then give it a rating on that. The only modifications I did were add a tablespoon of flour to the cut up apricots before putting them in the pan (as suggested by another reviewer to help the juices thicken up) and I used about 1/8 of a cup white sugar to sprinkle over the apricots first. The topping was perfect no cinnamon was needed. This was tart sweet and really brought out the flavor of the apricots. I have added this one to our family book of favorites. Thanks Miriam!",
