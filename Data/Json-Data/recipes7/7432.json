These deep fried corn meal sticks are crunchy on the outside and buttery sweet on the inside and are great for brunch, as a dinner appetizer, or as a snack at anytime of the day. These can also be prepared cheese-filled; just add a little piece of your favorite cheese inside your shape before frying. Yum!",

I am very happy to report that the particular ratio of ingredients here is SPOT ON. If you are looking for a sorullito that is crunchy outside and tender soft on the inside, with a taste on the sweeter side,  THIS IS IT!!! (but of course you can reduce the sugar and increase the salt a bit if you want it to have more of a savory taste).  I did put a stick of extra sharp cheddar cheese inside of each piece for an extra YUMMMM Thanks for the recipe Marisa!!!",

My entire family raved about it. I was not too sure about the mayo/ketchup sauce but it compliments the sticks beyond belief, I made exactly as directed and would not change a thing I would not even add the cheese as it said could be done, THESE ARE PERFECT THE WAY THEY ARE> Thank you for sharing a divine side item.",

It's 4/5 stars simply because I'm from a Puerto Rican household and I've had my fair share of sorullos so well my standards are high. But this is a really nice recipe! Really crispy when fried but soft inside. Oh and in terms of the mayo ketchup I just make it to taste. Start with a dollop or two of mayo and a squirt of ketchup. Adjust to your taste. It's very forgiving. Yummy! Buen provecho!",
