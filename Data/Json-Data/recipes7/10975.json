I liked the addition of the coconut sprinkled on top, which also gave some sweetness to the rice, so keep that in mind as well if you plan on using it. I added some salt, but that was per my own preference. Oh, and I used Jasmine rice, which was wonderful in this. I would def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
