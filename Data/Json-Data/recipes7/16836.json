Milk scum was all over my mug which was able to be taken out so it didn't end up in the drink and I had a mess to clean up. Not sure what happened there but it's still good! I wanted to add a drop of mint extract to make it peppermint hot chocolate but I found out after I made the drink that I don't have any... so there's an idea for someone who wants to try it! Also I suggest doubling the recipe because 3/4 c of milk isn't that much to drink. All in all the recipe is still good but I think some could be added to it to make it amazing!",
