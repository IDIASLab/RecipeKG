Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! I added apple cider in addition to/instead of chicken broth and a few dashes soy sauce. I increased salt a bit, added garlic and onion powders in addition to the fresh garlic & onion. The sage and rosemary really complement this dish well! Make sure you use very fresh spices, as is the case with any recipe. I also used beef chuck roast since I didn't have pork handy and it was awesome. I look forward to trying it with pork. I also used fresh butternut squash, peeled with vegetable peeler and cubed, since that's all I had on hand. Yummers! Oh, and since I like the meat very tender, I simmered the meat with liquids/spices about an hour before adding veggies, then simmered another 1/2 hour. Adding the veggies long after the meat was an excellent idea and helped veggies retain their pretty color and shapes. I cut carrots on the bias for oval shapes instead of cubing, but either would be pretty.",

Then I poured in one cup of the chicken broth and scraped up all the brown bits before putting it all in the cooker w/ the rest of the broth and spices. I skipped the butternut squash only because I didn't have any. Would love to try it next time though. At the end I mixed 2 tbsps of flour and a bit of cold water and stirred that in at the end. It made a savory gravy! Mmm I'm going back for more....",
