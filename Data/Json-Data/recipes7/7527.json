I mostly followed the recipe except used 1/2 tablespoon of fresh coriander and a teaspoon of organic peanut butter (made from just peanuts) in the dressing instead of chopped peanuts because that's what I had. Next time I will use more of both: maybe a full tablespoon of fresh coriander and a tablespoon of peanut butter (if I don't have peanuts). The peanuts are an important part of the taste. We ate this as a side salad to burgers, and it was very good. I imagine it would also taste great on rice.",

No doubt about it this salad does have a kick. If you're in the middle on spiciness you may want to add half a tablespoon of the chili-garlic sauce taste and then add the rest if you feel you need it. Same comment applies to the addition of the red pepper flakes. This is a pretty nice Asian cuke salad and I definitely liked the flavor of the coriander which is a spice I've not used often.",
