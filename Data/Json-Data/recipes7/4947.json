I've left out the tomato and it's still great. In winter, I make this with hamburgers to remind us summer is not far away. I use super-sweet, sweet yellow and white, or Summer Crisp corn. If you use fresh sweet corn, be sure to blanch it first and then give it a bath in ice water to keep it crispy. Tasty ! Easily doubled -- this batch makes just enough for my husband and I.",

Tonight I used 1 Tblsp sugar and 1 Tblsp Splenda with 2 Tblsp cider vinegar and 1 Tblsp rice wine vinegar. This is the amount of sweetness we like in it but some like it a little less sweet so adjust to your own taste. Also for tonight I used a can of Summer Crisp Mexicorn (I think its called Southwestern actually) that had red and green peppers and black beans in it. Added a can of rinsed great northern beans also. Was REALLY good with the beans added protein and fiber. Thanks to all who have reviewed--it helps to get feedback. I appreciate that and I'm glad you liked the salad.",

He didn't know what I had made for the meal. He's has a very discerning palate but does like things on the sweet side. This was definitely the hit of the meal in a family that really knows how to cook and enjoy food. Followed the recipe exactly except that I had a small shallot I wanted to use so replaced the sweet onion. Will be making again definitely! Thanks for sharing.",
