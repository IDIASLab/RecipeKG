                "reviewBody": "I am giving this 5 stars because it even works with other loaf types. I will say this is an attention getter. Most often people ask (for a potluck) who made the garlic bread because it tastes similar to garlic bread and looks somewhat like garlic bread. I made two versions with baguette style loaves and recommend if you are using that type of loaf that you use an extra large baking vessel so that your loaf can spread open. It works best with the harder crusted loaves. As an experiment I also tried it with a softer white cheese simply because of my taste preference which I do not recommend since it ends up melted at the bottom of the loaf. The swiss cheese is best because it \"stands up better.\" You may also lay slices flat after dipping one side of the bread in the mixture (two sides may be too gooey) and then placing your cheese on top and baking it that way. No matter what the taste is fabulous although I recommend it for special occasions since there is so much butter in it and like some potato chips it's difficult to limit yourself to just one slice.",

We call it Porcupine Bread because of how the loaf looks when stuffed with the cheese and mushroom.\nOur variation based on the recipe I use:  \n1 lb loaf of Vienna bread (can't find this in our new state!!  I use any type of soft loaf with crispy crust but family does not prefer sourdough.  It is pretty dense.)\t\n1/2 lb grated Swiss cheese and 1/2 lb grated Monterrey Jack,\n8 oz fresh mushrooms, chopped finely,\t\n3 green onions, chopped,\n1 c butter melted with 1 tsp Lawry\u2019s salt, 1 T dry mustard then 2 T poppy seeds over the top.\nBasically follow the recipe directions here however, the mushrooms and cheese are mixed with a little green onion, then the bread is stuffed.  Finally, pour the butter mixture over all.  Top with additional green onion and sprinkle with poppy seed.  Wrap tightly in heavy foil to bake.  \nEveryone's favorite is the bottom of the bread because it get so crispy.  I think adding the butter after the cheese makes a big difference.\nAnd no, this is not a recipe for the calorie conscious ... but then ... we should all take a break from that from time to time!!",
