My husband thought it was a great salad! I would make it again and consider taking it to a pot-luck picnic.",

To save time I used bagged cabbage and bought broccoli slaw instead of cutting broccoli heads in to thin strips. The addition of the spinach and grapes was very noticeable in this salad we really it. I mixed it up in the morning and it was well blended by dinner time. I liked that the spinach wilted down in the dressing. I served this with 'Onion and Sausage Pizza' from AR and we had a delicious meal.",
