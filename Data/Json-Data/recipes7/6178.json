It is amazing just the way made as posted. Depending what I have on hand or my mood I may leave out bacon or egg and add lots of other colorful veggies in. No matter what I do to it it is amazing! We made it last night for dinner as listed it was a hit. Today for lunch with added red yellow and orange peppers and grape tomatoes and I could not get enough. Still have lots of dressing left (yum) now to go buy more spinach. Very versatile great for families cookouts and crowd pleasing.",

I only got a little on my plate because it was mostly gone when I sat down (just me and the BF ate lol) so that speaks volumes since hes not much of a veggies eater. Watch the sugar since how much you need will really depend on your brand of ketchup and I had to add salt to mine but again depends on what ketchup your using. I used all the drippings from the bacon and added enough oil to make the 1/4c needed. I wold totally make this one again!",
