My husband requested strawberry shortcake for his birthday and the silly goose thought I would BUY one! I went looking and found this recipe and even though it was my very first time making one it came out amazing.:) (I am a much better cook than a baker so I was very pleased this turned out so well.) Mom and Dad loved it (Dad's exclamations upon seeing his piece involved the word \"Shazaam!\" LOL) and my hubby was bragging on me at work the next day even showing a photo. I followed the recipe exactly changing nothing and making good use of our Kitchen Aid mixer. I used a foil pan because I didn't have the right size pan. The cake came out sweet and firm but wonderfully textured and Mom said she would have been happy to eat it plain! Beginning to end this recipe was easy and tasty even for the rare baker like me. We used too many strawberries the first night so next time I might use three pounds.;) I just can't wait to make it with in season berries! Finally it tasted every bit as awesome the second day.:D Thank you for sharing Petra and for helping make my hubby's birthday a success!",

An VERY important step is to spray the pans with Pam Baking Spray (or use melted butter and flour) line with parchment paper and then spray it with Pam again. This will ensure that the cake slips right out after baked and looks PERFECT. I thought it'd be ok to just spray the pan when making another similar cake and it ended up a total mess! Another tip is to make sure the beater and bowl are completely clean before you start whipping the egg whites. My insertion blender stick did an amazing job of whipping them up fast. Anyway I made the recipe exactly as listed except I added vanilla extract and extra sugar to the whipped cream. I wanted a recipe with simple ingredients for a birthday cake for my MIL and this one fit the bill. She LOVED it and was duly impressed;) and everyone else thought it was delicious too!",
