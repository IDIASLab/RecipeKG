I will definitly make it again soon The only reason that it isn't 5 stars, is because i didn't use the same proportions. I added about three cups of mushrooms (which was actually a little less than I wanted) and I didn't use 3/4 cups of wine. I think I probably used about half a cup maybe less, and I think more might have been too much. But other than that: AWESOME. Thank you grandma Maggio for this great recipe.",

Since I have cooked my own version of a sauce with the higher amounts of these items, I know how much BETTER this recipe would have been.\n\nI will make it again exactly as calls for, unless I prefer a lesser sweetness, but I found it quite enjoyable and a nice change form the standard type flavors.\n\nTHIS SAUCE ROCKS!! Try it exactly as written, so you can get a great idea of the taste.\n\nMuch thanks and appreciation for this wonderful keeper (at least in my family's cookbook) of a recipe.\n\nEDIT 09/11/2011 - To really make it special try adding the meatballs from 'lovestohost' - \"Meatball Nirvana\".

I wanted to give it a fair shot and waited for two days to review it.  I know that often times, flavors need time to meld before the finished product can be judged fairly.  This sauce is just okay but not worthy of five stars.  I liked the flavor of the merlot wine -- it made a richer sauce.  However, I think I will keep my original recipe handed down through my paternal Italian side of the family and add the merlot as a boost to the flavors.",
