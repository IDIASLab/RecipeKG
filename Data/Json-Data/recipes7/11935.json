I might experiment with skipping the eggs and perhaps adding some oats (though I do realize that would turn it into a whole different recipe!) to make them denser and less fluffy. Anyway it's good as it is but I did make a few changes: I used butter instead of oil and only 1/3 cup but I increased the pumpkin to make up for it. I used about half white sugar half golden brown sugar (next time I might use all brown). I used 1 cup regular dark chocolate chips but I stirred them in instead of sprinkling them on top.",
