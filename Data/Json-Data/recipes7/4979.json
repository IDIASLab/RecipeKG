We left them in overnight and we used all three of them. We also added a little bit more sugar it was quite tart. The raspberry flavour was really really good. Next time we are going to try it with real lemons instead of powdered lemonade I think it might improve the taste a little bit. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing",
