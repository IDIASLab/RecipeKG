It is, essentially, an entire no-bake cheesecake stuffed between 2 chocolate cakes, with half a box of Oreos in the middle, and the centers from a box of truffles on top. That's what it boils down to. My husband is so proud, he took a picture to share with all his friends. This is delicious! I used extra Oreos in the filling to make it prettier. I don't like the frosting from this recipe. It tastes good, it looks good, but this cake has to be stored in the fridge, and that stuff sets up *so* hard that cutting the cake revealed a huge-fault line down the middle of my cake.  Crrrack! The solution, of course, is to take the cake out of the fridge an hour or so before you plan to serve it, and the cream cheese will have stabilized the Cool Whip enough to do that, but still...I think next time I'd use \"Satiny Chocolate Glaze\" from this site instead. Thank you for a wonderful birthday cake for my husband! (P.S. I cut down on the sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup and could go to 1/4 cup as the Oreos themselves contribute quite a bit of sweetness, and I prefer a slightly more savory filling when it comes to cheesecake type filling!)",

When I do make it I totally eliminate the sugar that's in the middle part -  I'm not big on sugar and don't like things to be super sweet, besides, there's plenty of sugar in the cookies. I still get rave reviews and people asking for the recipe. The one thing I would recommend is to put the ganache frosting on one layer of the cake while it's still on the rack AFTER it's cooled completely and BEFORE you put it on top of the cake over the creamy middle. *MAKE SURE THE FROSTING/GANACHE IS COMPLETELY COOLED BEFORE LIFTING IT TO PUT IT ON THE CAKE.* I have put it in the refrigerator - rack and all - to help harden and cool it. (You might want to put newspaper down to catch the chocolate drippings.) I have found this to work best because on a few different occasions I put the frosting on after assembling the cake and it tends to crack the top, making the top of the cake fall apart and look like a mess. Still tastes great, though and one you have to try!",

I used the Wilton fanci-fill pan and filled the center with the Oreo filling (this recipe made the perfect amount for the filling though if you want extra to decorate the top of the cake then I suggest making an extra half of the filling recipe). I iced the cake with chocolate ganache instead of using the chocolate icing part of this recipe. As for the sugar others commented on the sweetness of the filling so I only used a little over 1/3 cup of sugar and light cool whip and it tasted good to me.",
