I mean sugar and jalapenos? yuck! Well today I finally opened that jar that had been sitting in the back of my fridge for two weeks. I did what the others did and used it on crackers and cream cheese. This was amazingly good. I will say that I found I needed to get as much liquid as possible off of the jalapenos before putting on top of the cream cheese. Otherwise it was too sweet for my taste buds. I can't believe this tasted so good especially when I expected it to taste pretty bad. I'm glad I tried it! Also if you wanted to make a spread you could just add the peppers to the creamed cheese and mix. If you were planning on making a bunch of little cracks that would probably be the way to go.",
