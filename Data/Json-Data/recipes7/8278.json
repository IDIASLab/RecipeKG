We are not really a fan of those donuts, but, I bought them to help out the school band.  I was so darn happy that I did.  I tore apart those donuts and used them in this recipe instead of bread.  A gigantic OMG...The absolute best we have ever eaten.  I do have one suggestion.  I made ours in a very tall bake pan.  This made the Custard part sink to the bottom and it turned out spectacular!",
