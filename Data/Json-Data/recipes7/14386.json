I used almond meal for a little of the flour and coconut oil for the oil. I used half the salt but next time I'll probably leave that out completely. I only made half the amount of crumb topping it called for and that was still plenty. I discovered that sour milk works just fine in this recipe. Next time I might add some grated coconut to the topping. This cake is not as sweet as some and with the smaller amount of topping I think it would make good muffins.",
