                "reviewBody": "Tangy and delicious! Let me start with the crust which is sent from the bakery Gods to give us an idea of what heaven is like. This crust is crazy easy to make and tastes just like a shortbread cookie. It puffs up a bit when it cooks, but shrinks back down as it cools. It was hard not to eat it alone! The filling is a nice balance to the crust. It is very tart (much more so than a lemon meringue....think lemon bar from the bakery), which I love. I will make this again but I would blend the sugar up in a processor first to make it a finer grain and help it dissolve better. It was pretty grainy, so I found I had to whisk the filling for quite a while to get most of the sugar blended in. Also, FYI the pie did not set in the oven! The recipe says to cook it until set, so I had it in for almost 35 minutes. But it actually did not set until it cooled. When it does, its a very pretty presentation (see photo). I sprinkled with confectioners sugar and topped with homemade whipped cream and homemade raspberry sorbet. Perfect after an Italian meal. Thanks so much ChefChristi!",

I use the side of my fingers to nudge the material into place to get even thickness where the sides meet the bottom.\n\n113 grams (1/2 cup) butter - instead of 3/4 in the recipe\n67 grams (1/3 cup) granulated sugar\n129 grams flour (this is 2/3 of 1 3/4 cups)\nHealthy pinch of salt\n1/2 - 1 tsp vanilla\n\nShave chilled butter with a cheese grater into sugar. Mix with pastry blender, add vanilla and salt, then flour. Use the pastry blender. Press into the pie pan with your hands to feel a uniform thickness, only 2/3 up the side of the pan otherwise the shortbread will break up.\n\nI chill the crust for at least 45 minutes. Heat the oven to 350 and bake the crust for 15-18 minutes on the lower rack. Let the crust chill before baking with the filling in it. No modifications to filling, except more lemon zest to kick it up a notch. \n\nBake 30 minutes.\n\nCool overnight. Get ready to be loved.",

Everyone raved about it and I had 2 request for the recipe and of course I told them I got it from here. Love the mix of tangy sweet and crunch and yes I agree with AZ93 the crust itself on its own is yummy:D. I also love the fact that the filling doesn't have cream in it for personal reasons but if you do prefer it to be creamy you can always add a dollop of whipped cream on top of it. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks ChefChristi1221:)",

I've made this 3 times now and the filling didn't set any of the times without adding about 10 mins. The tart crust got just a tad overdone this way so I'd reduce the baking time slightly when baking the shell.",
