After cooking orzo, I put cooked orzo in a bowl and added juice to orzo without heating and allowed the juice to absorb into orzo, stirring occasionally.  Once juice was absorbed into orzo, I put the bowl of orzo into the refrigerator for about an hour.  After given time to cool, I added fruit in recipe (1 can of pineapple tidbits, 1 can mandarin oranges, and maraschino cherries) to bowl I also added some coconut flakes and crushed pecans.  Then I mixed in cool whip, until well blended.  Ihe salad isn't thick but it's lightly sweet and very enjoyable.",
