I also added a little garlic salt and pepper. Then I mixed that mixture and the butternut squash together in a casserole dish. I prepared the stuffing mixture alone. Then I mixed in half of the stuffing in the casserole mixed, and then topped with the rest of the stuffing. I baked for 25 minutes at 350. It was delicious! And adding the ground beef turned it into a complete meal. Yummy!",

For the stuffing mix, I used Stove Top (for chicken) and thought it gave just the right amount of seasoning. The only error I made was making the cubes of squash a little too large so it took about 10 minutes more of baking to cook them through. Next time, I will cut then into smaller, more bite sized cubes. I served this as a side dish to some baked chicken.",

In step 2, at least double the time for simmering the squash to get it slightly softened as 3 minutes isn\u2019t sufficient. If not sufficiently softened, the bake time is extended with the risk of the casserole not being as moist as it could be. Using the deeper baking dish caused the cooking time to be extended to about 50 minutes (increased temp to 375 degrees during last 25 minutes). A definite make again as everyone luved this very tasty side dish. Thank you apz2002.",

I am not giving it 5 stars only because I made some changes.  I didn't use butter or shredded carrots.  I added a bit more finely chopped onion.  I also added finely chopped portabella mushrooms and lastly, I shredded some good cheddar cheese.  I just mixed everything up in a bowl (after steaming the squash) and put it in a baking dish, sprinkled more stuffing on top and threw it in the oven!  So easy! Oh I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned stuffing in the blue bag.  Thanks for the great casserole idea!",
