I built a large foil tent over the pie to keep the meringue from totally over browning, bumped up the temp to 375, and then put it back into the oven for 15 more minutes.  Whew, that seemed to work pretty well, even though the meringue ended up a little browner than I'd have liked.  I used fresh raspberries, so I did add just a little water to the pan for some moisture that would have been in there had I used frozen berries.   Raspberry and lemon are two flavors that always partner well, and this pie was no exception.  You have the sweetness from the raspberries and the tartness from the lemons, so each and every bite is pure bliss!  I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site.  Thanks ejm228 for sharing your recipe.",

Also whipped 4 egg whites instead of 3 for the meringue. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

It's just a teeny smear at the bottom - hardly notice it's there. Try doubling or or tripling that. 2. Directions seem to indicate that the egg yolks are added (unbeaten) while heating the sugar mixture. I added the yolks into the initial sugar mixture then whisked the contents. The yolks cooked (of course) and little bits were all through the curd. I recommend lightly beating yolks and keep them separate til the curd has thickened. Then add 1/2 cup of the curd mixture to the yolks whisk together & pour all into curd mixture in the pot. Whisk together and continue following drections.",
