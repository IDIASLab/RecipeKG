The surgery topping is an added touch. I accidentally forgot to add the slivered almonds to the topping and didn't notice til the cake had been in the oven for several minutes- was still great! I used a slightly bigger springform and baked for 30 min- perfect! I used the.cake for strawberry shortcake, really takes the dessert up a few notches!",
