Follow these steps to make it authentic: I used only 2 cups of rice (makes plenty) & soaked it for a couple hours in 3 cups water. Make sure you use glutinous rice!  Cooked it with half the can of coconut milk and soaking water. Cook it just like rice till it gets soft and mushy. Used brown sugar,a little less than called for. For topping:instead of preserves,I used macapuno strings (4 tbsp) or more. They're like coconut strings,sooo good. When you remove the biko from oven,it will be slightly soft and a little liquidy. But, when it cools it sets. The finishing touch is brown coconut jam spread on top. I will never buy biko again!!!!",
