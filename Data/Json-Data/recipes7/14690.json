I've made it using chipotle paste when I was out of ground. I've subbed tofu for the turkey, too. I have found that making the broth way ahead of time, even freezing it, then adding the squash a few minutes before serving, really brings out the flavor. I add sliced avocado and it gives the soup a cool, smooth touch. I've even added guacamole and never even got arrested. This soup rocks! Thank you for the recipe.",
