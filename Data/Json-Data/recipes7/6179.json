The water and cornstarch took over 25 minutes to thicken even a little bit (never got a nice pudding-like consistency). I drizzled the warm mixture into the egg whites and it took another 35 minutes and 3 more egg whites to get it past the liquid stage and I'm a really good cook....I KNOW what stiff peaks should be like. The taste of the ingredients was wonderful but right now I have it in the freezer trying to harden it enough to slice instead of spoon into a dish. I will toy with this one because I believe it's worth saving.",
