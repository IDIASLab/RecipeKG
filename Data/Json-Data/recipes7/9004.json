My wife is a vegetable phobe and will only eat most stuff covered in cheese sauces, white sauce, or candied in butter and brown sugar.  I also have Leeks staring at me from the garden year round, and I needed some other way than soup to use them up.   I personally cut my garden carrots (Nate's half-longs) into short one inch sticks to mimic baby carrots, and kind of mirror the cut on the leeks (Hannibal) the same way.  As a variation I will mix in parsnips at a ratio of 1 to 2 with the carrots.  The kids like the stronger flavor of the parsnips but the wife picks them out... More for me!\n\nPS After reading reviews... You can easily vary the vegetables texture from al dente to soft by how long you cover the vegetables before beginning the final reduction.  If you want al dente start off uncovered and cook a shorter time. A full 15 min covered and then heat to high for reduction will give you soft carrots and carmelized leeks.",

My leeks were kind of medium/small sized and I had 3 in the fridge so I just used them all. The only other thing I did differently was nix the sugar (diabetic husband and I didn't feel it needed it). First of all this smelled really good in the pan. My husband came in the kitchen and said it smelled awesome. It did take a bit longer than the 15 minutes stated for all my liquid to evaporate and everything to come together but no biggie. It was time well spent. My picky kids didn't take to it much but the husband and I literally devoured the rest of the pan with our dinner. Fantastic. This may be my new favorite way to make leeks.",
