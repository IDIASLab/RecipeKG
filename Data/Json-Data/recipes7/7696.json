The OJ and the ginger work together nicely in this recipe. Thanks larkspur this is a keeper. UPDATE 6.9.18: This is one of our favorite carrot side dishes it just never fails. I increase the amount of ginger a bit and I cut them vertically into long pieces (just like the presentation a little better). Quick easy and always a winner!",

And the sauce was very thick so I added a little more juice. Otherwise made it exactly as written. The flavor is wonderful -- lightly tart lightly sweet with a generous hint of ginger but the ginger is nicely balanced by the orange juice. Family loved it I loved it... I'll be making this again soon and often. Thanks for posting!",
