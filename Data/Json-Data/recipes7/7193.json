(vinegar sour cream based) It does have a different taste but is great for a change of pace. It is very adaptable and I tried using 1 tsp of sesame oil (this was doubling the marinade since I had read reviews so was a 3 to 1 ratio) I also added green onion and some tomato right before serving. It is very easy to adjust the tartness or sweetness. May never be your 'favorite' cucumber salad but it is very good. Give it a try... it is very fast and you don't waste expensive ingredients and with some new experiments!",
