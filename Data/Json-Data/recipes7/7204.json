We ate half for lunch. For the remaining half of this salad I'll add a little more shredded carrot for color and an apple for even more crunch as other reviewers have suggested. A tart apple will offset some of the sweetness of the dressing. I'll use less dressing on the remaining half of the salad for less sweetness and try a little less sugar when I make this again or possibly use a different dressing.",
