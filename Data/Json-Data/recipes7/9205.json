A great Asian dish to pair with rice and a veggie dish, or even  to serve with toothpicks as a appetizer. Her measurements are not exact, as it is a dish handed down in her family and they just know how much to put in.",

I used a heaping teaspoon it's got quite a kick and a little goes a long way. I also used one small package boneless skinless chicken THIGHS instead of chicken breasts. This turned out FABULOUS. I served this with homemade vegetable fried rice--NO LEFTOVERS. My husband asked me to make a double recipe next time to make sure there is leftovers.......or at least extra for seconds. This is a very economical recipe to make.",

I put in half a red and half a green bell pepper and the added flavor was delightful. When I make it again (which I absolutely will!)I will also probably put half the sugar in as it was a bit too sweet for our taste. Overall a great recipe!",
