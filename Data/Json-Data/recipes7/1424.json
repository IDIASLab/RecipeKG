        "description": "This is a delicious modification of a classic Thai dish! You've probably had the chicken version if you're a meat eater, and I'm sure you could substitute meat for the seitan, however, I urge you to give the seitan a try. Seitan is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Seitan comes the closest to real meat that a vegetarian or vegan can have. Seitan really picks up the flavor of whatever marinade it's put into. If you've ever had 'mock duck' at a Thai restaurant, then you've had seitan before. It can be found at natural food or Asian food stores.",

I made the sauce per the recipe except that I used agave syrup instead of sugar and used only half the amount called for since I think coconut milk is sweet enough as it is. It was pretty good as is but the only flavors I could really pick out were the peanut butter and coconut milk so I doubled the seasoning elements (red curry paste chili sauce and oyster sauce) and that helped a lot. I wasn't sure about the spinach but it added a nice color to the dish and blended in well with the other flavors. I served this over whole wheat spaghetti. Will make this again with my changes.",
