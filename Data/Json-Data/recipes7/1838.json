Also I added a couple tablespoons of honey to the roasting veggies to add some extra sweetness. Like a few others I added about 1/2 cup half and half at the end. It was spectacular...the balsamic vinegar drizzled on top was inspired! Crushed pistachios would probably be good on top too although my son is allergic to nuts so we didn't try it. Also there was huge variation in rutabaga size at the store so I just used one medium-large sized rutabaga and it seemed to be the right amount. Thanks for the recipe!",

Mixed the whole lot back into the pot and simmer it for a few minutes to blend. Came out great!! This does make an almost obscene amount of soup though. I should have halved it.

I went back to the store and picked up a medium sweet potato and 1 lb of carrots roasted those and pureed them into the soup. Add a star! Much more to my liking more balanced flavors thicker. I will make it again but with the modifications.",
