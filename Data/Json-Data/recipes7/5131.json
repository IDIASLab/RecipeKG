She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!! Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.",

Also, lemon extract can be substituted with lemon juice (rule of thumb is 3x amount of extract called for, i.e. 3 teaspoons of lemon juice for 1 teaspoon of lemon extract). The dusted sugar on the pan gives a nice crisp, but sweet outside, while the zucchini makes the inside super moist!",
