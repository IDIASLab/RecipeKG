I made this as written. I wasn't able to get all of the pepper skin off, but it didn't seem to matter. I measured everything and chopped everything before I started. This is not a chop as you go thing. Speaking of chopping, maybe get your family members or friends to help you chop. There is so much chopping. I also recommend getting pre-chopped walnuts and pre-extracted pomegranate seeds. It will save a lot of hassle. The flavors were mild and complex. I really liked it. I will likely make again.",

It\u2019s even better the next day refrigerated of course and reheated!!I love goat cheese and when we saw it online we had to try it! Make sure your pomegranate seeds are fresh we read somewhere that they expire quickly so don\u2019t add those to any that might be leftover because it said they are chewy and loose their flavor. Tidbit even we didn\u2019t know. So I put ours only as we served the plate and the next day we used a new pomegranate!! Thanks All recipes!! By the way we LOvE Chef John on your website!! He always makes sense but his tagline ENJOY! As he says it just makes me giggle!!! It makes me smile!! Keep him on here! I love the video aspect and how he speaks!!",
