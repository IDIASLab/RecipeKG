I split the recipe in half to make sweet muffins and savory muffins. 1) follow basic recipe minus sour cream and sugar. Increased honey to 6tbsp plus added 1 cup thawed sweet frozen corn pulsed with 2-4 tbsp unsalted butter. Also added 1/4 cup heavy cream to the 1/4 cup of milk. 2) too make savory I added garlic powder, onion powder, black ground pepper, Cayenne pepper and shaved Parmesan cheese ( 1/4 cup or so). I love these base recipes that you can build on. These were a big hit. Thank you for sharing.",

I halved the recipe and also put it in a small round cake pan instead of making muffins because my muffin pan is MIA. I also omitted the sugar just as a preference and I am glad I did because it would have been too sweet for us. The cornbread turned out moist and fluffy with a wonderful honey flavor. This will be a permanent switch for our house. Thanks!!",
