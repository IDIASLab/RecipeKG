I have made this 4 times over the past 4 days (I had alot of shrimp in the freezer) and here are my changes. Omit cayenne. 1 1/2-2tsp garlic 2tsp ginger minced five japanese dried red chili's (I found mine in the spice packet spice section of the grocery store where eveyrthing is like.99c)sliced down the middle or just use 1/2 -1tsp crushed red chili flakes ( I used both)or to taste 3tbs vinegar 1tbs sherry or wine 1/2 tbs ketchup 6tsp white sugar 1tsp fish sauce or 1/2 tsp salt (I used fish sauce-no salt). Fry the shrimp really well definately longer than 45sec. I use a cast iron skillet and cook the shrimp pretty hard until I hear it start to hiss. The goal is to get a good crispy shrimp. Once they are tossed in the sauce some of the crunch will go away but it will still have great texture. Drain on a paper towel or cooling rack. All the other ingredients should stay as is. Combine the ingredients that make the sauce ahead of time to let the peppers marinate to give it some heat and after you do the garlic ginger step and add the sauce and cornstarch mixture make sure to let it get really reduced to concentrate the flavors. I kid you not I sat down and couldnt believe how close this was to the real thing. Don't forget to serve this over white rice.",

I did fry them in veggie oil with some sesamee oil bc I didn't have peanut oil. Will make again but with better batter!!!",

Also if you don't have a wok you can cook it in a large skillet and be fine. A wok is not necessary.",
