I doubled the recipe for holiday cookie plates. MY CHANGES: I left out the almond extract (because I didn't have any and I don't normally like it anyway) and added a tiny bit more vanilla extract. I also used confectioners sugar in the dough mixture to give it a smoother texture. I mixed the finely chopped walnuts into the dough then rolled them in my hands to make little 1.5\" balls. They baked for about 10 minutes, I think. I didn't really time them-- I just watched for golden edges. They kept their general \"ball shape\" and didn't flatten much at all. I let them cool a few minutes on the cookie sheet, then transferred them to a cooling rack. When they reached room temperature, I gently rolled them in a bowl of powdered sugar. My family was eating them as fast as I was finishing them. I love that these have the taste of a Mexican Wedding Cookie, but are softer and have the hint of cream cheese. Great recipe! Thanks!",

I used all butter (no shortening) and they came out great; the cream cheese flavor isn't too strong but definitely gives the cookies a nice flavor and texture. I would recommend letting them cool about 4-5 minutes before rolling in the powdered sugar or they get sticky. I stored mine in a big ziploc bag with the remaining powdered sugar and they kept very well.",

While my son Chef Junior (also on this site) is out making real snowballs here in snowy NH I am back to the kitchen to make the Peanut Butter Blossoms also on this site as part of a large cookie assortment tray I will bring to my New Years Eve gathering tonight.
