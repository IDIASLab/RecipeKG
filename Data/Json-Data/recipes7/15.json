Last night, one person switched from white wine to the Sangria and never went back! We made three changes because we think we are \"Sangria Aficianados.\"  We omitted the cherries and carbonated water, and added 1/2 cup Peach Schnapps, and substituted diet 7-Up for the water.  Aside from the basic bones of this recipe (the wine, oranges, lemons, limes and specified liqours), many variation work.  Apples and Pears work.  We always add Brandy and Triple Sec and use 7-Up, but if something is not around or we run out, we find substitutes.  I have friends who add dry fruit to their Sangria.  (I think it is sweeter, but tasty.  They used dried mango and pineapple.)  This is really a great ice breaker at a party of friends or acquaintances.   ",

The flavors from the sliced fruits really come out after the Sangria sits overnight. I doubled the recipe and it nearly made two quarts. I am not a maraschino cherry fan so I left those out. If you would like, you could add a little club soda to your glass to tone it down for those who cannot handle the stronger flavors of the alcohol.  My husband liked this and thinks I should make it again.  I concur!  Great drink for warmer weather!",

Here is what I bought to make enough to make 5 times the recipe (30 servings).  4L jug of Carlo Rossi Sangria wine,  750 ml bottel of Blackberry Brandy, 750 ml bottel of triple sec, and a couple of 2 liter bottles ginger ale.  I used all the wine and most of the brandy and triple sec.  I added the ginger ale before serving and only used about a 1/2 a bottle (wanted to add more so that it would serve more people but the taste testers said it was great and not to add any more).   I did not use sugar and made it the night before.  I should have made the serving for 60 or even more because it went fast.  Will absolutly make again, and I dont even like wine!!",
