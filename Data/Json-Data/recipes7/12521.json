I added 1 tsp each lemon and lime zests and 1 tbsp each of lemon and lime juices in the batter. In the cheesecake part I also added 1 tsp each of lemon and lime zest and 1 tbsp each lemon and lime juice I reduced the sugar to 3 tbsps and added 12 drops of yellow food colouring to make a nice sunny yellow colour. The cookie is part is too sweet I would reduce to 3/4 cup of sugar next time. I would also reduce baking temperature to 350 mine needed 12 to 14 minutes to set but the bottoms were browning too fast. I omitted the nuts due to allergies and left the cookies plain. My #60 scoop made 45 cookies.",

They're a dry-ish cookie, but I like that sometimes.  Works perfectly here with the custard like filling.  I'd say it's a great cookie and worth making!",
