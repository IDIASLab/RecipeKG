The taste was great except it was a bit heavy on the orange for me so next time i'll add less zest. I added fresh cranberries to 1/2 the mix because i had some left over and i really enjoyed the tartness. Also i had to bake these quite a bit longer (but i always seem to have to increase baking time for anything with pumpkin or sweet potato). Overall a great and new dessert for us!",

I used to work at a pie shop that made this frosting and they actually used a microwave to make the frosting because there is less chance of burning (just a tip for those who don't want to use a stove). I did use the stove and it worked out great. If you put it in the fridge too long it may get pretty solid but all you have to do is warm it up for 10 seconds or less and it's creamy again. This is exactly the frosting I was looking for. Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "Cupcakes came out decent they were moist but they seemed a bit dense (not fluffy cake like) - Maybe I added too much sweet potato. Plus I adjusted the serving size for 24 and only got 18 cupcakes out of it?! Not sure what happened there either. I had to make them small to even get 18 so if I made them a normal size it would have been less. The icing I completely screwed up. When I went to go add the brown sugar mixture to the powdered sugar it got all lumpy. Maybe I didn't do it when it was hot enough. It was a mess so I had to throw it all out and make another cream cheese frosting that I was familiar with. I added some cinnamin and toasted pecans on top and they came out pretty tasty but don't think I'll be using this recipe again.",
