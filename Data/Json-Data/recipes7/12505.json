I was in the mood to bake cookies but wanted something different from the usual chocolate chip, so these were what I chose to try. I\u2019m so glad I did! The original batch/recipe seemed kind of huge, especially for the first time trying them, so I cut it in half, which I\u2019m kind of sorry I did, because they didn\u2019t last long! I made these exactly as instructed. Buttery, gingery, molasses yumminess! Also, the chewiness factor was perfect. I didn\u2019t expect these cookies to be as good as they are, as they are pretty modest looking.    Super straight out of the oven, and just as tasty the next day. I will say that I didn\u2019t chill the dough and it was fine for me, but I did need to shape them (flatten) as they didn\u2019t really  spread out as they baked. Just something to note.   Awesome recipe, will definitely make again soon!!",
