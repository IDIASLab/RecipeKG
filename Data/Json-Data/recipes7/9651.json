I chopped/minced the squash instead of grating no butter used about a cup of coconut milk instead of coconut extract. The thing I thought was a little odd about it was the texture of the squash. I think next time I would puree the whole thing and say it was a coconut cream pie and serve with whipped cream. Good way to use up yellow squash. Will try again next time I need to use some up.",
