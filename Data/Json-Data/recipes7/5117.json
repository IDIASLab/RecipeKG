I got 35 cupcakes out of the recipe and I baked them @ 325 degrees for only 14 minutes (my oven is super HOT).  The icing is VERY sweet, but it really compliments the cupcake nicely. I did add a drop of orange oil, just to get a better orange flavor. I was able to ice about 18 cupcakes, but I like a lot of icing, so if you are just gonna spread it on, there should be plenty. I decided to freeze the un-iced cupcakes for another time. I really can't believe how fantastic these turned out...I will be making these many, many more times~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

                "reviewBody": "I made this as the Recipe Buzz Group Recipe for the week of September 27th. I could NOT be more thrilled with these. The cake part is so light, airy, & soft! I was expecting quickbread muffins at best but what I got was actual pumpkin cake! (I've never tasted pumpkin cake before -- many pumpkin quickbreads, but never the light fluffiness of actual cake with pumpkin!) For the frosting I used: 1 tsp OJ, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. orange extract (and the other ingredients as listed). This let me use less powdered sugar so my frosting isn't sickeningly sweet. It piped beautifully, and tastes like a Dreamsicle. This recipe produced ONLY 24 cupcakes for me. They baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and 35 minutes in 2 different brands of muffin tin. Lastly, when my photo is up, I used a Wilton 1M tip to pipe (outside in, concentric circles). There is just enough frosting for 24 cupcakes using a 1M but I'm sure is plenty for smaller tips or knife-spreading. Thanks so much for the recipe, I can't wait to share these! UPDATE: I tried to get out of making these this year & made apple cake instead & DH had a FIT. He came as close to mutiny as he ever would in my kitchen, so today I made these for him to take to work and we ate the apple cake ourselves, lol.",

Another reviewer said hers were done in 22 minutes so I checked mine at that time and that was perfect (the minis took a couple of minutes less time). For the frosting one large orange produced the right amount of zest. It's funny how when I buy any fruit with rind now I always pick it out with zesting in mind! These are delicious cupcakes! UPDATE: This recipe makes about 75 mini-cupcakes and look perfect using an M1 tip to squish on a dollop of the frosting! Check for doneness at about 15 minutes.",

I made them for my son's end of football party and they were a hit. The adults enjoyed them too. I did NOT get 32 cupcakes out of it though I ended up with 21 I think and I felt that was filling the cups 3/4 full. I can't complain. I kept a few for my family then sent the rest. Since I got fewer than I expected I would've doubled the recipe but I always follow it the first time as is. My family definitely wanted more. I had more frosting than I needed and may make another half-batch. Thank you for this!",
