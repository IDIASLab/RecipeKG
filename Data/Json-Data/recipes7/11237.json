Like another reviewer said \"this is better than regular chocolate cake.Light and fluffy when it came out of the oven and a little more dense once it cool down, but delicious both ways. I only had 1/2 cup of butter so I substituded the rest with melted coconut oil and buttermilk instead of regular milk. I would like to use half coconut oil half butter next time so I'll report back to see how it turned out. Thumbs up from everyone in our family!Thanks Stacey for sharing your recipe :)",

The first impression was so awful I thought I was going to have to toss it, but after it sat for a few hours some sort of miracle happened, and I have to admit it's exceptionally good, and I don't mean just as a \"healthier\" version of chocolate cake.  Of course, if you're looking for diet food, this isn't it, but if you're going to load up with sugar and fat, you might as well include a healthier carb if it's this wonderful.  I frosted it with a simple ganache made with about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with 1/3 c. sour cream.  It may be my signature dessert from now on.",

Some changes: (1)  I substituted coconut oil for butter.  (2) I added 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. instant coffee to the melted coconut oil to bring out the richness of the chocolate flavor  and (3) I substituted 3 T. coconut sugar, 3 packets stevia, and 3 packets monkfruit extract for the sugar, so it's not quite as sweet (I don't like super sweet cakes). ALSO -- I whipped the eggs and milk for a couple of minutes in the blender before adding the quinoa. This makes the texture of the cake very fluffy.",
