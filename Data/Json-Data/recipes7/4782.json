As recommended by another reviewer I used apple cider vinegar rather than the red wine vinegar and preferred that exchange.

Family \"yummed\" their way all thru dinner and told me that it tasted just like my German potato salad except with green beans! Thank so much Frank!",

Amazing complement to my grilled bacon-wrapped Elk Backstrap Filet Mignon! I urge people to follow the instructions as I was too busy with my grilled salmon the first time I made this and it was not as good as last night's batch. When the bacon STARTS to brown add the onions. I had hard unappealing bacon the first time because I let it finish like I would for breakfast then had all the extra cooking time on top of that. To those who have seen fit to complain about the vinegar taste please pay attention to the name of the dish then note the word vinegar a second time in the ingredients. Then don't make this dish and that should save you much heartburn about the flavor you will achieve with this side.",
