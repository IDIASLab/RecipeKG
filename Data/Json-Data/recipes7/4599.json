Since it was the first time making it I didn't change anything. The hubby said it could be sweeter. I eat mine with butter and honey so I didn't notice. Even the kids liked it. I loved how easy and quick it was to make....and in the microwave. I'd never heard of cornbread done in the microwave before. Mine took a total of six minutes to be completely done but even at that.....it's a heck of a lot shorter than in the oven! And great for a last minute add to dinner! You definitely have to try this!",

It didn't crumble to pieces when I split the slices to butter them.  The only changes were that I used 3 Tbsp sugar due to previous reviewers advice, and 1/2 tsp salt because salt enhances other flavors.  I used a 9\" pie plate with a juice glass in the center to ensure against a soggy middle.  I greased the cookware, added the batter, and cooked in a 1200 watt microwave for 3 & 1/2 minutes.  I reheated it later for 30 seconds with no discernable change in quality.",

It does not have the texture of regular cornbread (well my kinds) - very light and almost cake-like not too much cornmeal touch of sweetness. There is no browning or crust to speak of. It's very delicate and doesn't hold up well to being buttered. However I thought it tasted great. It was warm and fresh and done in 4 minutes on high (800 watt oven). I made it because I forgot about the bread until I was serving and because I'm cool like that I know I'll gratefully be making this again. Thanks!",
