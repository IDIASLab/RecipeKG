I used to go there everyday for that thing! It was my all-time fave. I made a half batch as I was only making it for myself. For that I used half a small banana (anything more and I think it would be too much) and 2/3 cup fresh sliced peaches. Mine was smallish and badly needed to be used up so I tossed in a bit more than half. I did not peel the peach as I don't find it to be necessary. Plus...it's a pain. Since I had no orange-flavoured yoghurt I decided to improvise and used plain yoghurt along with 1/2 tbsp oj concentrate. After tasting I found it needed no sugar made this way. Everything else stayed the same. Total heaven. It's thick creamy orangey peachy and sweet! If you like oranges and peaches you'll love this! I have had this for three days in a row now. I am addicted!",
