I will say that I did not use the 1/2 and 1/2, I used 2% milk because that it what I had on hand.  It worked perfectly.  I think that using the 1/2 and 1/2 would have made the filling too rich (if there is such a thing) because it was plenty rich as it was.  Also, for me, it works better to blend the cornstarch, sugar and salt together in the sauce pan, add the beaten eggs and incorporate them and then add the liquids a portion at a time.  This ensure that all the cornstarch and egg gets incorporated into a smooth mixture before you begin cooking it.  My tasters LOVED this recipe and I will be making it again.",

Then I added the beaten eggs and gradually poured in the milk. I did use 1/3 cup cornstarch and I used 2 and 1/2 cups of 2 % milk and only a 1/2 cup of half & half. Those were the only changes I made from the original recipe. My husband always loved his mother's coconut pie as we all did. No one in his family had her recipe. My husband says this recipe comes close. He thought his Mom used fresh cream after they milked the cows and it was of course much richer. Many thanks for sharing this goodness!",

Used 4 egg yolks in custard (no whole eggs) and used 4 egg whites for meringue. Only 4 tbsp sugar in meringue. Toasted the coconut before adding to the pie. It is beautiful and the custard is perfect. Will make again for sure!",

I would have preferred a stronger vanilla custard.\nI think the 30 minute cook time is unclear. Mine came to a boil much sooner and I kept cooking it. I should have known better, but better instructions would be, \"...slowly bring to a boil over low heat, could be about 30 minutes. Let boil for 1 minute and  remove from heat\".\nAnd the meringue instructions do not match the picture. The instructions call for soft mounds. Those are peaks in the picture. When I think of meringue pie, I think of lightly toasted peaks.",
