I just added another banana and I threw in a handful of pecans and milk chocolate chips. And as with every baking recipe that doesn't already have it I added 1 t of vanilla and 1 t cinnamon. Next time I'll probably add another teaspoon of cinnamon. I had to cook it a little longer probably because of the extra banana. I think it was about 70 minutes total. Overall a good loaf of banana bread and I'd make it again.",

When using vinegar in baking recipes I think it should be noted that when advised to set aside it is at the very minimum for 5 minutes I usually make sure I give the vinegar 10 minutes to infuse with the ingredients. I wish we would remember to say what type of pan we are using too and not just the size. I find my banana breads work best in some sort of metal pan and not the glass or non-stick pans. I wish I could give 5 stars as written but would give 4 1/2 stars with the suggestion of another banana and vanilla. I actually went searching for this recipe today because I forgot to save it in my recipe box.",
