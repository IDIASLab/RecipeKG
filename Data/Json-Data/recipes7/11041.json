I did have to alter the cooking time due to doubling the batch, so please watch the timing, I believed it safely baked for 50-70 minutes as I checked on it quite often. **When using the orange extract, I used Lorann Professional Kitchen Orange Bakery Emulsion and needed 3 teaspoons when I doubled the batch and tripled the coloring affect for a more vibrate pop of color with in the batter. Everything else was to a T. My husband is harder to please when it comes to cheesecakes because he likes just plain. Will eat a chocolate or Bailey's flavored but this one, won him over big time and once cut and served....didn't go to far and was gone rather quickly. Will totally make again and again. TY so much, wished you could have seen the \"dreamsicle\" faces that I got when everyone was enjoying this recipe.",

Mine was perfectly baked at 30 minutes. For those who want to make their own crumb crust, one sealed packet of graham crackers, crushed, combined with 5 Tb melted butter, baked at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, makes just the right size/thickness of crust for a 9\" pie pan. Prebaking the crust lends a pleasant crunch. I replaced the sugar with 3/4 cup Splenda, as I find that with baked goods, it takes more to ensure the proper degree of sweetness. It was just sweet enough, without being cloying. Guests didn't realize they were eating a low sugar dessert (not completely sugar free because of the graham crackers.) They were doubly delighted when they found out! With that substitution, it makes an excellent dessert for diabetics. The filling as written comes right up to the top of the pie pan. The flavor is fresh and perfectly tangy. I used 6 drops of yellow and 3 drops of red food coloring, which made for a pastel orange color, reminiscent of an actual creamsicle.  A lovely, easy-to-make dessert that's a sure-fire crowd pleaser.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was a good \"jumping off\" point, but definitely needs some tweaking. There wasn't enough orange flavor for my taste. The orange was so mild, it was more of an after-taste. And the food coloring called for in the recipe only created the merest hint of food color. (But, I do understand that some people prefer no food coloring, so that's OK.) \n\nThe next time I make this, I'll add freshly grated orange zest for a more intense orange flavor, use more of the filling for the orange, so there will be a nice layer of the orange cream on the top, and will probably add more food coloring to make a more intense orange color -- especially if the grandchildren are visiting. A nice touch would be topping each slice with a slice of fresh orange.",
