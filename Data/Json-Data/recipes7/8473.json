They were easy to make and were very soft, fluffy & moist. I recommend oiling your fingers when you start to shape the rolls, as the dough can be a bit sticky. I did use butter in place of the shortening. I put them into cake pans--a dozen in one pan, and a bakers dozen in the other pan. Everyone raved about the rolls, so this one is a keeper!",
