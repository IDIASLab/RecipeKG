I found that a few hours in the fridge was easier than in the freezer (dough was easier to cut). I also rolled the dough into 3 - 4 rolls to make handling easier. I also tried a batch with dried blueberries and those were good too. Mabye a little drizzle of icing across the cookies would make them even prettier. Thanks!",

Update: not as hard after spending the night in a closed container. Took them to a pitch-in and got lots of positive comments. I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4 stars and won't bake them as long next time.",

I only froze the dough for about 40 minutes and that still worked out though it was a bit sticky. Also I hate doughy cookies so I cooked them the suggested time and then left them in and watched them until they were the texture I like. The first couple were good but they were super hard the next day so I had to microwave them every time I wanted some. I would advise following the cook time and letting them sit to see how they harden. Mine looked raw but I bet they woudl have hardened into perfection.",
