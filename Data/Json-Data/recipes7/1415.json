The outside gets a delicate thin crisp shell with the inside keeping an incredible softness that melts in your mouth like fudge. I covered and kept my extra baked cookies in the fridge and the next day they still had this consistency. The batter is very loose until well chilled (you need more than an hour) and then is able to be worked with as instructed (I chilled mine overnight). Don't overbake... cookies will set up. I didn't have dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder which is acid-neutralized and used Hershey's natural unsweetened which was still good. The nut chips and raisin combination perfectly compliment one another and there isn't anything I would change for this recipe except to double it to make more more more!!",

When baked they were a more \"cakey\" style cookie. I prefer something crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This cookie is soft all the way with a tendancy to be crumbly. I still gave this four stars simply because of the uber \"chocolatey\" flavor. The texture left me feeling that something was missing.",

I made the first batch having sprayed Pam on my cookie sheet and the cookies splat because of the grease and were very flat. The next batch I placed on parchment paper and these looked like totally different cookies. By the way one recipe makes a dozen cookies.

Even at high altitude 14 minutes was the perfect baking time. The only thing I did different was to use chocolate chunks instead of chips because I like encountering big chunks of chocolate in my cookies. The first tray I forgot to flatten the balls but in the end I liked the way that tray came out better than when I flattened them just a little. I'm still debating whether or not to include the raisins next time I make these - they provide an interesting surprise in the cookies and in the final analysis I think I like that.
