In fact, it was soo good we made it a 2nd time 3 days later when the first cake ran out. I am a closet gourmet chef & only eat desert usually if I make it (don't waste time eating store bought sweets).  I'm not a cake fanatic, but this one yum.  This took 3 hours like it says & turn off & leave for 30 more minutes -- I made it exactly according to the recipe -- we serve it on a plate with a side of ice cream (butter pecan is good or mint chocolate chip) & drizzle chocolate sauce (just a smidge) on top of ice cream & cake & top w/ whipped cream (can is good for this).  I've made this twice & plan to make it a 3rd time any day. Tastes like devil's food. Smells soo good cooking.  Don't heat it up in the microwave fyi or you may dry it out.   Leftovers stay well for a few days w/plastic wrap atop & left in crockpot w/lid on if you like unplugged of course.  I'm not sure why people are saying rubbery, tasteless.  because that's furthest from the truth for us.  Maybe they used Canola oil - u Have to use a heavier oil - like vegetable oil.  I used Crisco veg. oil)  I have a large oval Rival pot.   I am searching for great recipes for my crock pot cookbook as I've found a lot of crock pot recipes are awful.  This one is a keeper.  Just like the italian sandwiches on this site for the crock pot.  yum  I've passed this recipe off already.",

Using a slow cooker smaller than that may require more cooking time as the cake will be thicker than if you use a larger slow cooker. I saw a lot of reviewers were upset because it didn't specify what size slow cooker to use and their cake took longer to bake than specified. I figured I would add this to my review in the hopes it will help people. Just keep checking it. As soon as you see the cake starting to pull away from the side of the slow cooker it is done. Turn off the slow cooker and follow the rest of the directions.",
