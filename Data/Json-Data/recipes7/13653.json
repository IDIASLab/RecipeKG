I was skeptical about the batter not having sugar in it  but glad I waited. Do not skip the glaze part of this that is where lots of the pineapple flavor and sweetness comes from. If you do the glaze it don't need the powdered sugar.  If you really want to put sugar in the batter I would only use a tablespoon or 2.  The second batch I did use a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste because at this point we was already in love and I wondered how it would affect the flavor. I was not disappointed as I said we ate 3 batches. I will say if you do not drain the pineapple good enough it may be a little thin but you can add a tablespoon of flour at a time to thicken it to desired consistency. If you do not have self rising flour do not fret just use 1 cup AP flour and add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.  These will be a staple in our house from now on. Thanks for sharing!",
