It's a large recipe and that's good.  By the time I distribute bags of cookies to my grandsons and a few friends, I'll have some left for me too.  The only changes I made to this recipe was that I used regular Craisins instead of the cherry flavored and it was fine.  I love the buttery taste of these cookies and I'm sure my family and friends will too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

I programmed it for 20 servings and got 18 of really very yummy cookies but I have to admit that I did use all butter. I loved what my 13-year-old granddaughter had to say: \"What's in 'em?\" \"Almonds cranberries and white chocolate chips.\" \"I don't like those but I'll try them anyway.\" A few minutes later \"Can I have another one?\" And so it goes. I had to send several more to her family after they tasted them. So these are a hit! I love how the bottoms are all crunchy but the middles are soft. I guess these will be asked for once again!:) Thanks for the recipe!",
