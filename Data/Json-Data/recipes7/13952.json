        "description": "I have been reading about this traditional Chinese dish on the Internet and found there are many different versions of it. Some are spicy, incorporating chile and ginger. Others have the spices of star anise, cinnamon, and lots of garlic added too. The recipe my grandma passed on to us here is the garlicky one. Garnish with some chopped spring onions or cilantro and serve with steamed white rice or buns. I like to serve a side dish of pickled cucumber slices with the pork and this tanginess brings another dimension to the dish. Chi Fan (time to eat)!",
