First time, made it with strawberries and based on other reviews here, half the amount of cream cheese called for in the recipe.  YUMMY!  I can't imagine how rich it would be with twice that amount of cream cheese...seems excessive. Second time, used raspberries in place of the strawberries.  YUMMY!  Third time, swapped out the cream cheese with mascarpone cheese and it was AMAZING.  It was lighter than the cream cheese and brought out the flavor of the fruit.  Before serving, I just sprinkled a little powdered sugar on top for show.  It's a nice colorful breakfast with the fruit.  We used the sauce sparingly, since it was so sweet.  Basically, any berry can be substituted for the strawberries.  I didn't have enough raspberries for the sauce the third time around, so I threw in a few blackberries to have 1 cup total.  Still came out wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!",

I knew once I filled the baking dish that it would take longer to cook since it was deeper, and it did take nearly 1-1/2 hrs.  The bread cubes on the top were starting to get a little too brown, so I just put a piece over foil over the dish until it was cooked through.  I had some blueberries in the fridge, so I added them to the strawberry layer.  For the strawberry sauce, I used both sliced and chopped strawberries and probably added more strawberries than the recipe called for.  I forgot to add the butter to the sauce at the end, but I really didn't miss it, so probably wouldn't add in the future and just save a little fat.  I used FF half-and-half and reduced fat cream cheese which melted beautifully in the center.  This is soooooo easy to make, and its presentation is impressive.  It was a treat for sure, and I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.  Thanks, Tamala, for sharing your recipe.",

I added some cinnamon and some vanilla to the egg mixture.  The only issue I came across was the cook time.  After cooking for an hour, the center was still pretty runny.
