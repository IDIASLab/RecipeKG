Light and summery, with a great flavor. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it (and I'm pretty sure they weren't lying- haha!). I used one green and 2 red apples and followed the recipe exactly- no changes are needed. Please give this a try- you will be pleasantly surprised! (also- I used one medium zucchini though you could certainly use 2... 2 medium is better than one large zucchini so you can avoid all those huge zucchini seeds)",

Maybe the red wine vinegar is critical to this dish. I wouldn't let my experience stop you from trying this salad. It has merits. It is crunchy tart and sweet. Maybe it will be better tomorrow.

We have yellow and green zucchini, oh sooooo many, so good way to use up a couple of larger ones.\n\nI use olive oil (we have an olive orchard and harvest them for the oil) and fresh basil from the garden, and also substituted the red wine vinegar with a fig balsamic.  I let that sit in the salad about 4 hours before our first taste and it was delicious.  I think many variations would be easy with these base ingredients, so I am anxious to try some more.  I have some peaches ripening, and the onion flavoring with the peaches sounds great too.  Great recipe.",
