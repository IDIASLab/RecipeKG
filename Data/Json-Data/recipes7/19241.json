Soaking the ribs first is the traditional method. I recommend soaking for at least an hour, though traditionally you would soak them for longer than that, changing the water after the first hour. If you don't have an Asian pear, an apple will do as a substitute. Serve over white rice.",

The veggie prep was a little time consuming but thats because were so used to getting a bag of frozen and throwing them in the pot. The flavor made the radish peeling all worth it. Served with mashed potatoes and a nice green salad. My wife still works so I do a bit of the cooking happy wife happy life with this dish.",

I didn t peel the radishes and served the dish with rice. My instant pot took about 15 minutes to heat so it definitely took longer than 35 minutes to cook. My husband used the leftovers to make a vegetable soup adding more carrots plus broccoli mushrooms and left over rice. Delicious.",

I made the mistake of buying the traditional thin cut Korean ribs (about a quarter inch slice) and the cook time was way too long, resulting in the meat almost disintegrating.  I'll definitely try the recipe again with  a thicker cut of meat or less cooking time. I found another recipe on line that recommended a 1 minute cook, 5 minute natural release for the thin cut ribs. I almost didn't add the radishes, but they turned out very tasty and not at all bitter after being cooked.",
