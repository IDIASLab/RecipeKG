The crust okay so you can't go wrong if you buy one. I chose to make my own - just as easy probably cheaper and tastes better and fresher: 1-1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs 5 T. melted butter 2 T. sugar - in a 9\" springform pan. The cheesecake filling is standard - can't go wrong there either. But the topping... what a watery mess. Either reduce the nectar probably by half or increase the cornstarch probably by double. If you don't you'll end up having to do what I did and have to struggle to fix this after the fact. Also I don't undertstand the reason for tossing the boiling hot juice with the fresh mango - -unless you're trying to cook the mango (not). Once done this is very good as well as pretty - four stars for sure. On its own prepared as the recipe directs? - a store bought crust with a basic cheesecake filling topped with chopped mangoes suspended in juice. And given what you'd end up with three stars is generous two stars is more accurate but I don't want to discourage anyone from trying this recipe with some important modifications.",

Don't be afraid to work with fresh mangoes even if you're not accustomed to them. The fresh ones really beat canned ones anyday. I usually buy desserts but saw this recipe and decided to try it. It was easy and got rave reviews from my family and friends. Now I have to make mango cheesecake at least once a month or I start hearing alot of complaining about how I never make mango cheesecake anymore! Thanks TNARINESINGH. You rock!",
