This gives the soup a rich smooth base that I have not found in others. I had trouble finding refried black beans at my grocery so I googled it and made my own. Very simple and very good. I halved the recipe below to make the quantity about equal to that called for in the soup recipe. Amazing soup... This is a must try. Refried Bean Recipe 2 (32-ounce) cans black beans rinsed and drained 2 cups water 3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil 1 large onion diced 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon cumin Puree 2 cans of black beans in 2 cups water in food processor. Heat the lard or other fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onions with the salt and cumin until golden about 10 minutes. Add the beans and continue cooking over medium heat stirring frequently until the liquid evaporates and the beans form a creamy mass that pulls away from the bottom and sides of the pan about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.",

The refried black beans although sounded like a good idea just left \"chunks\" and a \"gritty\" texture the more I stirred the more the other beans broke down. I would like to try it again but I would definitly use a food processor for the refried beans and broth and maybe add a little more fat somehow for the gritty factor. Other than that sounded like a great recipe can't figure out where it went wrong.",

First time I couldn't find refried black beans so I made it using the Low-Fat Refried Beans recipe on here. Made it again after I found canned refried beans. I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth because I never have that around and I too used tomato sauce because I also never have tomato puree around. Overall I didn't do anything to change the flavor really which was very good and was good on a cold day. (Though admittedly I started getting tired of it after making it twice too close together.) I liked it best with sour cream stirred into it. (In fact without the sour cream it's more of a 4.) Oh yes and it was pretty easy - not a lot of prep other than measuring and dumping into the pot.",
