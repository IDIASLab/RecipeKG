Followed recipe exactly and the \"pies\" turned out fantastic and utterly delicious! Cookie stayed moist with a strong but very pleasant molasses flavor. Filling was perfect smooth and overall not too sweet. Chef John you are one of my absolute FAVORITES. Every one of your recipes I have made has turned out marvelous. Your personal style lends to the intuitiveness of your most helpful videos even to a neonatal-novice like myself. And I SO enjoy your charming humor! Thanks again Chef!!",

                "reviewBody": "I watched chef John's video and followed his recipe exactly as written. Well almost exactly - I doubled the recipe for a class party. These were easy to put together with very little mess. The cakes baked up in the expected amount of time. The size came out very consistent using my cookie scoop! A stand mixer came in very handy for putting the filling together. I gave it some time on high speed to make sure it was properly fluffy (watch the video). I took the completed pies to a class of 5th graders for their holiday party and most of the kids finished them. After just one bite one boy exclaimed \"I will have an order of 20!\" He followed up with my daughter later to ensure they could be delivered after the holiday break:). At home we put the extras to good use. The gingerbread flavor was present but not overpowering. The combination of the gingerbread cake and the cream cheese filling was light and the textures perfect. Overall a great dessert! The doubled recipe made 28 complete whoopie pies. The cream however was probably 50% more than what was needed. No problem we will just make more whoopie(s)! We appreciated the video as it was instructive and a good length. Our 5th grader did not appreciate his quirky sense of humor but then that was not the intended audience. We will be looking for more of your recipes. Thanks Chef John!",
