This was tasty (but greasy) flatbread. The cooking time seems to be good except it seemed a little doughy on the inside so I took it out of the pan and put it directly on the rack in the oven for about 10 minutes longer with the oven turned off. Only minor changes I made was to use a bit of maple syrup instead of the refined sugar. Next time I will use less oil maybe 1/8c or even less. Reminded me of the batter on the deep-fried chicken balls in Chinese restaurants. I will try this again maybe as a pizza by adding the sauce & toppings after flipping it. Thanks Carol!",
