I would recommend if you want an even amount of both to put half and half of each mix. For my first time I was pleased. The camera came out in between which a nice touch. Personally I still need to find a more authentic flavor one but I really appreciate this 1 recipe here!! If it's your first time you definitely should give it a try. Thanks for sharing!:)",
