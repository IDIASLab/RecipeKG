That would be a great addition for kids but we are all adults and I didn't want them too sweet; my big guys enjoyed the spider web!:) I made this to play up Halloween this month. I used an 9\" pan but wasn't able to get as many circles as I needed to use up all of the cream cheese I would use a 10-inch pan next time. I followed the box's instructions which were \"bake at 325 for 50 minutes\" It baked perfect and the cream cheese didn't brown too much at the lower temp.",
