It is more of a jam since jelly is usually clear juice and it wasnt strained I did take some of the seeds and ribs out of the peppers before I put them in the blender. I used 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar because I didnt have any red wine also used cranberry juice instead of the pomegranate I wasnt sure about the pectin since all I had was the powdered so I used 4TBS and it turned out GREAT!! LOVED IT!!!! I will make this again!!! This is one of my new favorite recipes!!!",

It is unnecessary to mince the peppers because you are blending the in the blender and the less you handle them the better. WEAR GLOVES!

My package of pectin was 2 oz. not 1.75 oz. I used the whole thing plus the other 2 Tablespoons of pectin. I think it was too much. It was also a very dark red not at all like the picture showed. The Malbec wine was very dark and dry. I was not familiar with the wine so didn't know what to expect. I used unsweetened pomegranate juice which is also very dark. The recipe didn't specify what kind. I could have used one that was sweetened and more diluted then maybe my jelly would have been a prettier color. I didn't use the seeds and membrane of the peppers. The recipe didn't say to remove them but I knew we couldn't go that hot. In addition I ran out of hot peppers so I made up the difference by adding a cup of red bell pepper. Mine may be considerably milder that the original recipe but my husband (who is starting to think medium salsa is too mild for him) cannot eat this jelly. I m hoping he will like it as a glaze or marinade for meat. Thank you for posting it was fun to make.",
