It tastes good (not great but good) but it's too crumbly bc the butter didn't emulsify into tiny bits. I probably should've melted the butter into the dough when I realized my Cuisinart wasn't big enough. Can't take these to Thanksgiving but we'll enjoy them for the tree-raising on Black Friday. Thanks for sharing! (P.S. I found these marked \"Classics\" in the AR magazine and was very surprised to get here and see that this recipe had never been rated. Bit misleading had it actually been a classic I suspect someone before me would've mentioned that it doesn't work to just cut in the butter ha!)",

So I heated up the Left over Ballymaloe and Muskoka sauces with a little homemade strawberry freezer jam until it was spreadable. Glad I could make use of the sauces no one wanted as they were very tasty but made with real cranberries not sugar and juice??
