Taste the marinade beforehand add juice if it's too salty and soy sauce if it's too sour. Cook marinade for a few minutes afterward if u want sauce to pour over some garlic rice..the perfect complement to this classic dish.",

Served with a salad on the side it made for a quick meal that satisfied both me and my husband. Just don't forget that it needs to marinate for at least an hour before cooking! I made the marinade and got the marinated meat into the fridge and chopped up my onions. Then when it was time to cook all I had to do was throw everything into the two skillets and dinner was ready in five minutes. As written you'll end up with too little marinade. I made it with just one pound of meat but forgot to scale back the onions. It was still really tasty but I'll adjust the meat-to-onion ratio a bit better next time.",
