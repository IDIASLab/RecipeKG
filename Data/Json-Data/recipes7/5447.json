Hearty, filling and delicious! Cubed ham and finely chopped onions can be added to the potato and cheese mixture if you want more of a one-dish meal. Use American, muenster, havarti, or brie cheese.

I used a sweet potatoe instead also. Everything was heated in a deep skillet and added in order of how I listed. Placed it in a tender flake double pie crust to help save extra time. I basically made a whole new recipe but with guide lines from this one and it was so good the family asked to add it to our favourite meals rotation!! Try it you won't be disappointed and always add in your families favourite veggies finely minced for those picky eaters the sweetness made it almost like a savery desert I will be making this every month and trying new add in and flavour combos.",
