NOW...add 2 tbsp of the strawberry syrup to a glass, then add your mint and lime, muddle, add 1 shot of rum, top with Club Soda and ice cubes...and voila! Delish! :)",

I didn't measure out everything perfectly, but used this recipe as a guide for the ratios I should pour.   I put the ingredients directly into a glass pitcher.  I ripped apart the mint leaves so they were big enough that people wouldn't swallow, but not huge leaves floating around.  I used lime juice instead of limes, although I if I make again, I'd prefer fresh limes.  I also found that if I muddled the mint and sugar together first, then added strawberries and mashed them into the sugar and mint that the flavor was best.  On one batch I forgot to mash the strawberries, I just threw them in with other ingredients and the loss of flavor was noticeable.",
