I wasn't sure how full to fill these so I filled 3/4 full and I got 28 muffins. They didn't rise very much and stayed close to the same size as when the muffins were uncooked. I saw the amount of oil in these cupcakes and it seemed like too much for the amount of ingredients. I decided to stay with the ingredients in the recipe and instead I should have followed my instinct. They were WAY too oily. I would decrease the amount of oil to 1 cup and it may still be too much. The amount of oil resulted in not only a greasy muffin but an incredibly dense muffin. It was also much too sweet for our taste. 2 cups of sugar is a lot! I would have given these muffins a 2 star rating because they were really sweet & oily but my husband thought they were ok so I went with a three star. I would not make these again because there would be too many changes for me to get these to work.",
