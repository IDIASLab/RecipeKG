I needed two cheesecakes in a hurry, so I baked a 8\" and a 9\" at the same time.  I lined my pans with parchment paper so I could easily move the finished cheesecakes from the pans to bakery boxes. I wrapped the bottom of my pans with foil to avoid spills. I used a modified water bath, reduced the cook time to 50 minutes, and left the cheesecakes in the oven with the door closed until they cooled.  I received numerous compliments like \"better than Cheesecake Factory\" and \"the best cheesecake I have ever eaten\".  This recipe is a keeper - I will probably make it again this weekend!",

I have made this cheesecake oh, 12 times for various reasons and it is ALWAYS a hit! \n\nHint: The caramel mixture always drips out of the spring form pan, so a cookie sheet underneath is a must, otherwise your oven will smoke and your smoke alarm will go off and it's all a big mess.\nAlso, I always let the cream cheese soften, along with the eggs to room temperature, before I make this.  From crushing oreos to peeling caramels and chopping pecans to letting it sit overnight is a bit of a hassle but it is well worth the work, I promise.",

I have not altered the recipe one bit but I do note that the crust requires some upper body strength to cut through when cutting the cake into slices. The recommendation to line a cookie sheet with foil and place the spring form pan on that for baking was a great idea. This was a very heavy cheesecake and I worried about transporting it and decided to leave the bottom of the spring form pan attached and it transported without incident. A word of caution: this cake takes me much more than 30 min. prep. time.",
