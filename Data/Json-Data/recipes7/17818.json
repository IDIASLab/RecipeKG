While these cookies are good I don't think they are better than others that don't require the waiting time. I chose to put mine in the freezer for 30 minutes rather than the frig for an hour. I thought I was making 1-inch balls but I ended up with 38 balls for 1/2 the recipe. I still ended up cooking them for 10-11 minutes to get the outside edges slightly crispy. All that said the cookies were very good for my afternoon tea break.",
