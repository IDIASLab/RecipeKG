Seemed dry when first put together, but it really creams up quickly in the frig - 2 hours is plenty of time for it to set up.  I added two diced radishes, I think next time I will add four, to help the sweet factor and to add some more crunch.  Aftter reading reviews, I added more onion, ground mustard and a tad more salt.  Yummers!  Served with ribs and baked beans.  My boyfriend's take:  \"better than Southern cooking and I never had to leave my porch in Arizona.\"  And he is picky about his slaw.  POSTSCRIPT:  I cut back on the sugar the next time, and it just didn't taste as good.  I tried adding the sugar back in after I had already added the slaw -- didn't really work.  ",

After you put any vinegar based dressing on cabbage, some of it's water will leach out, making it soupy- this makes it creamier.",

I tried cutting down the ingredients from the huge amount we make at the store and it comes out to very much like this recipe.  Except we don't use any oil in our dressing.  You don't need it.  Just added calories.  We use a good mayonaisse instead of salad dressing and our slaw dressing would come out to 1 cup of mayo, 2/3 cup sugar and 2.5 tablespoons white vinegar.  About 1.5 pounds of shredded cabbage and one shredded carrot.  We don't use onions in our slaw although some probably would like that.  I would probably use a good sweet onion like a Vadalia maybe.  I'm thinking I'd also use celery seed instead of poppy seeds.  We use celery seed in our pickled slaw and it's good!  Letting it sit a while is the key.  That loosens up the dressing.  Just remember to stir it good before serving.",
