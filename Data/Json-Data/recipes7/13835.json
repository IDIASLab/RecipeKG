I have made this recipe about 5 times now, and have slightly improved it, I believe (not that the original is in any way bad, I just did some fine-tuning!).  As proof, I offer you this:\n\nI brought it for a staff pot luck.  I made a double batch.  It is all gone, and 3 people asked for the recipe.\n\nMy changes:\nThe 2 tbsp. of sugar is just a little much.  I used 1.5 tbsp.\nAs for salt and pepper, I used 1/2 tsp. each.\nYellow onion is the way to go.  Don't you dare use red!  I have not tested white.\n\nNot sure if it matters, but I used a dutch oven because I needed something big since I was making a double batch.\n\nI was apprehensive bringing the dish because I know that my family adores it, but you never know with things like onion dip at a pot luck.  However, I was blown away by the response.  Make this dish!",

I ll start with half the amount next time and add more if necessary. I used light mayo and Greek yogurt. One thing I love about this dip is that it s mellow/mild and it doesn t smack you in the face with an overpowering onion flavor like that famous soup does. Chef Sprocket thanks for sharing your recipe it s worth the effort to make.",

My mistake was using Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise (which I always do), but forgot that MW has plenty of sugar.  I already reduced the sugar from what the recipe says,  but that wasn't enough with MW.  How I fixed it:  added extra plain yogurt.  Didn't feel like waiting for more onions to cook, so I cooked some garlic in the microwave, added it...not enough flavor...added some garlic powder and onion powder.  Next time I will use no sugar with MW and more onions!  Otherwise, a great recipe!\n\nUpdate:  Made it again without any sugar.  Added 2 tsp on onion powder to give it a little more flavor.  That's what it needed!",
