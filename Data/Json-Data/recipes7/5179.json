You will want more gravy (trust me on this one), so do as others have mentioned and double the retained seasoned flour and beef broth. I upped the ante and added half & half (cream or milk would work too) to the liquid mixture and the gravy was creamy perfection. One other note, check this after about 1 1/2 hours to make sure it is not sticking to the bottom of your pan. If it is, simply lift the pieces of steak to make sure there is gravy underneath them. Keep cooking for the full 2 hours for the most melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious country-style steak ever. Wonderful over mashed potatoes or rice. Fun fact: Leftovers (if you have any) make a delicious sandwich. A piece of cold steak with a little mayo between two slices of bread is heavenly.",

I set the table with dinner knives but they weren't even necessary.  These were fork tender!  I found I had to thicken the gravy on the stove top when I pulled this out of the oven with a flour and water slurry, but that was no big deal.  I'm not sure I ever had cube steaks before tonight,  but  this recipe will compel me to buy them again.   This, served with green beans  and Mustard Mashed Potatoes, also from this site,  made for a perfect, not to mention easy,  make-again meal.",
