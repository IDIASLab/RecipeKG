Oh yeah I think theres two,so I went to get one and he said bring me the other one,well there was only one left but thankfully it was a moon cookie and we split it.Hubby said you need to make some more of these cause they keep getting better!!I said we can't eat these everyday----------but you sure want to*****",

I put the butter and sugars in the food processor and pulsed until it made a ball threw in the egg (only made half batch)and vanilla zipped it around some more fed the flour mix in through the top added the pecans and zipped it around some more to just combine. Worked perfect. Used #40 cookie scoop on parchment. Baked up beautifully. Put the cream cheese mix in ziploc cut the tip and piped onto the cooled cookie. Freezer on cookie sheet for a couple of hours. One isn't enough. The cookie is to die for I would have liked a little more strawberry taste in the cheesecake part. Great recipe thanks!",

Once my filling was combined I couldn't top the cookies because it wasn't thick enough; the filling would slowly ooze out while they were in the freezer setting. I made a few at a time so the next go 'round I let the filling sit in the freezer just long enough to thicken it but still be able to work with it. Seeing it's very hot outside I could only fill a few before the filling needed to thicken in the freezer again. It took a few 'batches' of filling but the end result was quite tasty. 4 stars for the slight hassle. At least now I have a bag of frozen tasty treats that will last a little while!",
