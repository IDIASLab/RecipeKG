The only thing I would say is that you absolutely MUST use a high-fat chocolate for this like a coverture. If the chocolate isn't high in butterfat the whole thing will turn out too dry. If you want to try with semi-sweet chocolate chips increase the fat content when you're melting the chocolate. This made me miss Vienna!!!",

Another commenter mentions that she believes this can happen when the chocolate doesn't have enough fat in it but I added quite a bit of butter. Next time I will try adding some yogurt instead and some extra sugar to compensate (yogurt in cakes eats up sweetness). I also wish I had let the apricot/rum mixture cool a little more after thickening. I tried to apply it while it was still quite warm and runny. Lastly I wish I had known how quickly the chocolate icing would set up; within seconds of taking it off of the heat it was like mud. In hindsight I should have been a bit quicker in pouring it on the cake -- do it all in one go get it as even as you can manage quickly and don't try to go back and fix the thin areas by pouring more on because the result will be ugly.",

Have never used a spring form pan before so I opted for the small ceramic dishes that I could control better; anyway I have cooked \"out of the box mixes\" with chocolate and I suggest to put a large mixing bowl over a pot of water (no overheating/burning of choc) to melt it. It is well...worth the effort if people enjoy a truly \"homemade desert\". If you don't have a \"La Madeleine\" restaurant then fly to Vienna by all means. Trying to make the syrup soak in was difficult because the cake is not soft enough. A second thing was the icing to which I had to add quite a bit more cream or it does NOT spread (too chunky). I kept it in the double boiler so it definitely needed more cream.",

                "reviewBody": "For Valentines Day I purchased a set of aluminum foil pans (2) and divided the batter between the two (thus eliminating the step of cutting the single cake into top and bottom halves). I reduced the baking time accordingly (about 30-minutes). I also lined the pans (bottoms and sides) with non-stick aluminum foil. The cakes came out great no sticking to the foil at all! I used Hershey Special Dark chocolate chips (my favorite) and the results...DELICIOUS!!! Reminiscent of the Sachertorte my Mom & I so enjoyed at Hansel & Gretel's in Vail once upon a time.....??",
