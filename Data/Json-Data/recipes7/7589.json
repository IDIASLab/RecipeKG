                "reviewBody": "The dough for this bread came together easily--smooth and elastic--probably because of the amount of yeast for the flour. The dough doubled in size in only 45 minutes catching me totally off guard. The cooking time was right on the mark. The bread part was quite thick and the seasonings just sat on the top. I could only bring myself to use one packet of the dry Good Seasons Italian Salad Dressing mix. When I put the cheese on the browned bread it wouldn't spread out very easily. Then when I went to cut it into wedges the cheesy part just fell off the bread. I have a couple of ideas how to do this differently. I could mix one of the packets of salad dressing mix into the dough which would help out that flavor. I think a better solution would be to roll the dough out double the size put all the seasonings and cheese on half and then fold over the other half and pinch it to seal it letting all the yummy goodness melt in the middle. This has strong possibilities and I hate to see my review keep anyone from making this bread.",

I used 1 tsp of each spice because all of my good measuring spoons were dirty and I had a lone teaspoon and tablespoon floating around. I also added a tiny bit of malted barley flour because a pinch in low flour recipes seems to make things fluffier. I ve added everything to the mix. Not because the other way didn t sound lovely but because my family has threatened to throw me out if I make one more loaf of bread this week. So I m making dinner rolls. Dinner rolls do NOT count as a loaf of bread. So I formed dinner rolls. They rose beautifully they smelled heavenly and they tasted wonderful. Sadly rolls have also been added to the banned list. But I will totally make these again! Next week!",
