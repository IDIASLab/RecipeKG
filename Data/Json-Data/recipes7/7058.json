Subbed blackberry jam because of a friend's preference, but I think they would have been even better with raspberry preserves.  I had to add an additional Tbsp of evaporated milk to the glaze to make it thin enough to drizzle.  I think this would be an excellent recipe adapted with lemon flavoring in the cookie and blueberry preserves for the filling!",

The yield was 3 dozen and even though there's only my wife and myself here they're already half gone one hour later! Like I said... YUMMY! Thanks for sharing!",
