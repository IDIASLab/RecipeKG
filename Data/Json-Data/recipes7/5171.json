I followed the recipe except for using 50/50 whole wheat and all purpose so I added in some vital gluten. I did not add the salt directly to the yeast proofing solution as that would have diminished the action of the yeast. Like Pam I needed to add significantly more flour to obtain a workable dough - 2 cups more in fact. It almost became too much for my stand mixer to handle kneading. I would have cut the recipe in half had it actually called for closer to that 6 cups of flour rather than just 4. There is a big difference between '4 cups or as needed' and 6 cups. I got two very large round loaves from this recipe. I found the flavor from the basil and cheese subtle but pleasant and the texture was beautiful. Thank you for sharing the recipe.",

During the kneading I added another 1/3 cup of flour to get a more workable dough. I shaped them into 2 small loafs. The bread came out wonderful and aromatic moist and flavourful. I served them with the Cream of Mushroom Soup I from this site. My kids and hubby raved over it.

I ended up using six cups of flour to mix and another half cup while I was kneeding to get to the right consistency. I put all ingedients except the mozzarella and basil into my bread machine and processed on the dough cycle. During the final mix I added the cheese and basil (fresh from the garden). I upped the cheese to almost two cups but for some reason didn't up the total amount of basil used - I should have. I was a little leary of the baking temperature but it was fine. I tented after about 10 minutes to keep the tops from getting too dark. This bread has a delicious flavor and I will be making again. Thanks so much for sharing!",
