The other one I am referring to is one that had not so favorable reviews and I loved the dish....this one has pretty good ones and ended up something I wasn't impressed with. There is a bunch of steps the egg provided an odd texture and the mushrooms were chopped and MIGHT have given the dish some flavor but got lost in the dish to me. I could not find the Chinese pancakes and used the chow mein noodles as others suggested and that was fine but the sauce was like a thick tar that didn't distribute flavor to the overall dish but was confined to wherever you dabbed it on. The pork was mighty tender but that is the only thing that stood out to me. Sorry but I will not be making again.",
