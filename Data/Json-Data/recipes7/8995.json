                "reviewBody": "These were very well-received when I made them at Easter.  The cupcake doesn't become anything tasting like a Cinnabon until you add the cinnamon syrup and cream cheese frosting (of course).  The advantage to this is that I suppose you could leave those items out and still use this for a decent basic \"blank canvas\" cupcake recipe.  I made one batch and only got 23 cupcakes, but I also overfilled several cups.  I expect that when (not if!) I make this again, I will be better about using my \"disher\" for consistent amounts in each cup.  I made one batch of frosting, which turned out to be pretty much exactly enough when you spread it on the cupcakes with a knife.  One thing I should mention: the papers pulled away from pretty much every cupcake when they were baked; between this and the fact that they were a little crumbly, eating these cupcakes is a messy (yet still enjoyable) experience.  This might be helped if you stir the syrup into the batter instead of just pouring it on top, like I did (lesson learned for next time!).  Overall, this is a very delicious cupcake that's just a bit messy - like its inspiration!  Definitely will be looking for an excuse to bring these to work soon...",

I would give 3 stars but since I didn't make the frosting I will give 4 (I don't want to get punished for not rating the whole thing) Anyway, the cupcake is okay in the tasty department. I am sure if I made the frosting it would all work great together. I thought I left enough rising room for the cupcakes but I didn't so they cooked over giving that flat top. I also sprayed my pans with baking spray and even doing this the cupcakes were so sticky that many made it out of the pans broken.(frowns) Since they were such a mess this is why I didn't make the frosting. I liked the flavor of the syrup but as another reviewer pointed out the brown sugar doesn't melt down, you end up with a buttery sugary crunchy syrup. I am just going to eat them with the crunchy syrup on the cupcakes and call these my mock no fry churros.",

The syrup ended up a mass of sugar and cinnamon swimming in a pool of melted butter. Still it worked as a delivery system for flavor. The proportion of frosting to cupcake was a touch sparse but not too bad and honestly more frosting might have stopped my heart! The pecan crumble turned out pretty bad. I am wondering if the butter in the brown sugar cinnamon mix shouldn't be replaced with Karo or something like that. I'm just starting to learn to bake so my thoughts shouldn't be taken as knowledge. I'll make these again.",

Delicious! I found the cinnamon sugar sank to the bottom of the cupcake when I swirled it in the batter but who cares you taste it with every bite regardless. The frosting was great if a bit sparse if you want to pipe it on (I used a knife and it was fine) and the cinnamon-sugar pecans on top were a great touch.",
