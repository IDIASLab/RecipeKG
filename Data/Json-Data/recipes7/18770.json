Although the tart had good flavor I do think the instructions could be more clear. I was very confused as the how to assemble the tarts. I wasn't sure what it meant when it said to pinch the corners of each square together. A friend from facebook sent me a photo from online of what we thought the author of the recipe meant. Leave the puff pastry square flat and pinch each of the four corners of the square individually. The pastries will be flat and topped with the apple filling. They cooked up perfectly. I do think it would be better to slice the apples thinly and layer them instead of chunking them. I also thought the apples were a little dry on top after baking. I left some of the pastries as the recipe stated and drizzled a caramel sauce on the top of part of them. We preferred the drizzle on top. I rated a four for flavor.",
