Thanks so much for a simple easy no fuss recipe!",

Minor changes for our palet included: 1/4 C less sugar, 1/2 tsp almond extract and to top it off 1 cup of almonds chopped to about 1/4\" then folded in after the ice cream reaches \"soft serve\".  For added indulgence top with a small dollop of hot fudge when serving!!!  Such a treat - thanks for sharing the recipe.",
