It is always a hit with those who like spicy foods. This recipe can be played with easily to tailor it to your own level of hotness and/or cocoa/peanut flavor. Mole is a sauce that has a lot of variations. I've even served it as a dip with corn chips!",

I used natural peanut butter (as in one ingredient - peanuts) and low-sodium tomatoes so added some salt at the end too. Also it seemed slightly bitter (probably due to the lack of added sugar in the natural peanut butter) so I stirred in about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar which instantly solved the problem.

I skipped the raisins because I don't like them and used whipped peanut butter (so I did add an extra dash of sugar in the end). Quite yummy!",
