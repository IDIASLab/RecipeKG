Just shred some cabbage and spread it on the bottom of your container. After you coat the shrimp with the sauce, the cabbage can catch the extra sauce, and you've got yourself a delicious salad!",

I like my walnuts crispy, so I threw them in the hot oil for a moment (maybe 10-20 seconds) after boiling with sugar. Note that this will dirty the oil a bit, so if you are concerned with presentation you might want to use fresh oil for the shrimp. I used cornstarch instead of the rice flour, and mixed to an \"Elmer's Glue\" consistency. The batter was enough for a pound and a half of shrimp, but if you use that much you'll need to double the sauce.  I never quite got the shrimp to a golden brown color, but I pulled the shrimp after six minutes and they were fine.  The batter is bland, but it lets the sauce showcase itself.  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce for a bit of tang, and served with honeydew melon chunks. Will be making again! ",

My preferences run toward light, flavorful, subtleties, and this dish, as listed, does not fulfill that requirement.  A far better method for treating shrimp in this manner is the standard wash of the walnuts in 1 cup of water and 1/3 cup of sugar.  Forget the egg white batter--it brings the wrong texture to this dish.  Instead, a very light egg wash with corn starch and panko is spot on, and the dip should be made minus the condensed milk with a very small touch of pressed garlic, so that you have what is essentially a very lightly touched aioli sauce with a honey sweetened linger on the palate.  That's the way you improve on what has been lost in translation.",
