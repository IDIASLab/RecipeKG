YUM!!!! I'm not vegan I'm not generally a huge fan of basil or pineapple but we had a dinner party last night and there were a couple of vegans so my friend made this and the pineapple/orange sorbet recipe from Allrecipes and this one was the favorite. The other was good but the pineapple/basil just was SO fresh and delicious that it was the preferred. The basil and pineapple compliment each other very nicely. I have added this to my MacGourmet (love it) Recipe program and will be making it soon. If you're on the fence about giving this one a shot I can highly recommend it!",

My pineapple was perfectly ripe and sweet so I added very little sugar. No icy texture that I often find in making sorbet this one is just smooth and creamy. The first layer of flavor is the pineapple then the subtle taste of basil kicks in. I cut the recipe in half used my 1-qt. Cuisinart ice cream maker and had sorbet 20 minutes later. And if you look at how this recipe breaks down nutritionally you can eat it guilt free. I would definitely serve this to company and I know this will be made again very soon. Thanks for sharing your unusual recipe it's a winner in this house!",
