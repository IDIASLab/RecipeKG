They are moist and fluffy. There are a couple of small problems, however. The recipe states to fill the cupcake liners \"to the top\". Even when I did this I ended up with 14 cupcakes. I'm a very experienced baker, so I wish I had gone with my gut and made 15 or 16 cupcakes. I ended up with the cupcakes spilling over the tops and adhering to the cupcake pan. I thought with all that baking powder they'd rise nicely, but they were pretty flat. I did follow the directions precisely, but added the vanilla with the other wet ingredients. I'm certain this didn't affect the outcome.  The frosting is delicious, but mine turned out somewhat thin, even without all the milk. My advice would be to make 15 or 16 cupcakes, and to add NO milk to the frosting until the very end and then, only if you need it.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was good but not great. Admittedly, I made a couple of mods: instead of oil I subbed an equal amount of pineapple juice which made it deliciously moist but baking time needed to be adjusted. I also used light brown sugar instead of white. Finally, and this was just my error as I misread the recipe, I used 2 cups of finely shredded carrot instead of 1 cup. The result was an ultramoist cake, really fluffy too. But it lacked the spice that typifies a carrot cake IMO, and I even added a bit of powdered ginger to it. I was surprised it lacked nuts and/or raisins but I figured maybe the taste would be so good that they wouldn't be missed. Not so. And I'm not the \"Paula Deen\" type of baker who thinks everything can be made to taste good with a ton of sugar and/or butter/oil. Kinda bummed.\n\nAt any rate, the recipe wasn't bad but if you like a moderately to strongly spiced carrot cake then this recipe isn't for you. I don't know that I would try this recipe again but if I did it would be so heavily modified that it wouldn't be the same recipe anymore.\n\nAlso, if anyone is curious, all that added moisture did not ruin the cakey-ness--it was just not a dry cake at all. They also weren't too sweet, but they did have an extra carrot-y flavor due to my error but still tasty. But like I saw another reviewer mentioned, they didn't rise particularly well. If you're okay with flat cupcake tops and the lack of texture and spice, then by all means try this recipe.",
