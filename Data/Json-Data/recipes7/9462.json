I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I cooked the berry mixture in a pan first, and then transferred it to a dish where I scooped the topping on top of it. I feel the topping didn't cover as much of the berries as I would've liked, since the berries were poking out from underneath all over the place, but I may have made the scoops too big. Word of advice, dish out small scoops to make sure you have enough to cover it all evenly. I would definitely do this recipe again; simple, easy, and verrrrrry good!",

The first time I made it I used 2 cups blueberries 3/4 cup raspberries and 3/4 cup blackberries. I cooked the fruit in a saucepan instead of a cast iron skillet and baked it in an 8x8 glass pan. It was good but here are a few changes I will make the next time I make it. I would cut the sugar in the filling down to 1/2 a cup instead of the 3/4. It was a little too sugary for my tastes. I would use brown sugar instead of white for the topping. I would also add some vanilla and/or cinnamon to the topping as well. Though the topping is yummy as is I think it could use a little more pizzazz. Overall this is a great recipe and it works with any berry! Yum! And bonus this can be made dairy free and even gluten free if you use a GF flour!",
