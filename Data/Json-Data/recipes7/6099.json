In the salsa I tossed the whole (de ribbed/de seeded) jalepeno in and I did not drain the lemon juice off of the cranberries...I heated em up and they absorbed all of it as my quick plumper upper method.Added: these were such a hit the family wanted them again....but I was out of cranberries and only had dried cherries on hand/tried using them. Dried cherries worked well too!",

OMG!!! What a terrific discovery it is! It does take a little time but the result is well worth it. I plan to make a double or triple batch and freeze them for ease in future entertaining. The salsa is very tasty and suits the wontons extremely well. A great accompaniment. I believe that the salsa would be even better if made a day ahead so the flavours have a good chance to marry together. Also the next time I make these I plan to spray the waxed paper with cooking spray so they don't stick before I fry them. I cooked them in my electric non-stick wok and this worked very well.",
