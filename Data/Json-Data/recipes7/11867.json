                "reviewBody": "I really like the texture that the Asian pears added to the apple sauce. I ended up having to add more apple cider because the mixture thickened rather quickly. I cooked the mixture for the initial 10 minutes smashed the fruit then cooked for another 8-9 minutes adding a couple more tbsp of cider. At this point everything was done. I don't think another 20-30 mins is necessary. The only change I would make is to use less cinnamon. I think half the amount would be plenty for my tastes. I might also use a bit less sugar but that's just personal preference and not anything wrong with the recipe. I served this warm with pork roast and also ate it cold later on as a snack. A very versatile recipe that could be used with both sweet and savory dish.",
