A couple things should not be adjusted. \n1. DO make sure you are using Arborio or carnaroli rice AKA Risotto rice. \n2.  DO use 8 cups of liquid to 1 cup of risotto rice for rice pudding. The larger grain makes the rice absorb more liquid. \n3. After bringing to the boil quickly, reduce to a simmer and STIR. STIR. STIR. Risotto is creamy because you stir it knocking the starch off into the broth making it creamy. So make sure you stir and often. \n4. If it's not thick, the rice probably is not done. \n\n5. It takes a considerrabe amount of time longer to cook things in milk than water, it's a viscosity and food science thing, so it is going to take longer than normal to cook the rice. \n\n6. Be patient. It's like watching a large pot of water cook. \n\nAs for my experiment with this recipe, I included a fresh scraped vanilla bean and contents at the simmer stage and omitted the cinnamon and vanillal extract. I also used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup. I like toppings on my pudding...like cooked fruit so I can always adjust the sweetness through those.",

The rice was nice when I tested it (after an hour of simmering) but ended up hardening a bit in the cooling stage. Now it is possible that I didn't have the heat high enough while cooking which lead to the soupy texture. But I'm not sure if that was the intention of the poster. If it is not my suggestion is to simmer for about 1 and 1/2 hours or until most of the milk has evaporated. This should solve the 2 problems I had with the dish. With the corrections this recipe would be a 3 or 4 star dish. It is very creamy.",

It is one of my favorites so when I saw this I was very excited to try it. Curious to see what happens when you use a different rice. The arborio rice gives it a different better texture than just ordinary rice. I usually don't write a review when I've altered it but it seems this recipe needs a few stars in its favor. I use nutmeg instead of cinnamon. Always have... and Chef Barbie I have an interesting varation for you. I put orange extract instead of vanilla extract. But since you use real vanilla bean that would be even better than the orange. These variations are just for taste the instuctions are fine and it turned out exactly how I imagined it would. I followed the chef's tips about lots of stirring.",

This is the recipe I have been looking for for many years. I got rave reviews from everyone every single time I served it so ended up making 4 batches of rice pudding in one week because everyone wanted it again! I tried the recipe using ordinary long grain rice and it did not work. Arborio rice is a must. I also ended up cooking it for about and hour and 15 minutes and it came out perfect! If I could give it 10 stars I would!!! (One cup of rice to 8 cups of milk and it ends up perfect. If you find it is not thick enough and seems too watery; continue cooking until it gets thick and you will not have a problem.)",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe. I know because it's very similar to mine that I've made dozens of times! For those saying it's too much milk to rice ratio-you're wrong. I'm a rice pudding expert, as it's my #1 favorite dessert in the world & I have cooked it hundreds of times, using various recipes, some of which cook the rice first in water, & some like this one, that cooks the rice in milk. I prefer the cooking in milk method. It takes a lot of milk because Arborio rice particularly, absorbs more milk because it's a short, fat, very starchy grain of rice.  The only change I would recommend is after bringing it to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cook, COVERED, for 25 min. This ensures the rice is thoroughly cooked & does a much faster job of it. I usually set a timer for 25 minutes to ensure it stays covered for long enough. After the 25 min is up, uncover & turn up the heat to medium until it comes to a soft boil or simmer,  then after a few minutes, turn the heat back down to low. Stir constantly during this entire time. It will thicken up quite nicely. The more you stir, the more it thickens, as this releases the starch. You can also use medium grain rice for this recipe, or my favorite, half Arborio & half medium grain. That combination of 2 different types of rice just gives it the perfect texture!",
