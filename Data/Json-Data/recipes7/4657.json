The tapioca surprisingly was cooked in roughly five minutes or so not 25-30 minutes. Yeah! I would have liked it better with only 3/4 cup of sugar but you decide. I also put in the whole can of coconut cream but one cup probably would have been fine. I added a beaten egg when the tapioca was still slightly hot because I wanted to make sure the pudding would be thick enough. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla.",
