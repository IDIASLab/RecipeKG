I made them a little healthier by replacing half the oil with applesauce, cutting the sugar to 1 cup (could probably cut it even more), using 1 c. ww flour and 3/4 white flour rather than vica versa. I also left out the walnuts, but used a little more dried cranberries. The whole family loved these.",

The only other change I made was by accident; my nephew was fussing as I was loading up the pan, so I forgot the walnuts :) The recipe made 12 good sized muffins with enough extra to do 11 mini muffins (I did remember to sprinkle nuts on that pan!). They come clean out of the paper wrappers, for some reason I have trouble with that, but these were nice and clean and delicious. The mini muffins I used non stick spray on, and they popped out with no trouble. The cranberries are awesome, I would like to try the golden raisins suggested next. :)",

I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I only had pumpkin pie filling instead of 100% pure pumpkin. So, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and the pumpkin pie spice by 1/2 tsp as it already has both. I don't typically see muffins recipes, with a dozen muffins, with over 1 cup of sugar anyhow. I used flaxmeal instead of the seed out of preference. I chose the optional golden raisins over the dried cranberries. I had 1/3 cup left and I thought it was the perfect amount. I also peeled the apple and did a small chop with it in my Vitamix blender on speed one. I liked that it could still be tasted versus having shredded it. That also saved time. The flavor worked well with the golden raisins. I thought they tasted a little more like apple than pumpkin, but that was no big deal. The walnut garnish was a nice addition. They took 27 minutes to bake and I just sprayed the muffin pan lightly with cooking spray and they came out of the pan with ease. I would consider this recipe again, in the fall, for a breakfast muffin. ty",
