I'm not very good at measuring \"cups\" of vegetables--for this recipe I used 1 head of cabbage 1 small bunch of celery and 1/2 an onion. We're not big fans of raw onion so reserved a little bit of bacon grease to cook the onion prior to combining with other ingredients (after draining well). This recipe is a great way to deliciously add cabbage to your diet!!",
