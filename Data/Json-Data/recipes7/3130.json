I cut this recipe in half BUT I cut the sugar back twice so for a half recipe I only used about a cup of sugar. After I'd cooked the zucchini with the sugar and it'd boiled I cooled it a bit and then stuck the mixture in my blender and really blended it down to a thin almost soupy consistancy. I then added it back to the saucepan re-warmed it then stirred in the lemon juice and gelatin. After all is said and done I think this was a fun recipe to make with on hand ingredients to make a quick freezer jam but for us it really wasn't a home run. There's nothing wrong with the recipe it just wasn't for us.",
