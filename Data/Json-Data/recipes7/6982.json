I had angel food cake, sponge cake dessert cups, and Cool Whip to make Strawberry Shortcakes with these strawberries. These were not too tart or sweet, the balance was perfect. I also used good tequila for the recipe, so the flavor was mild and smooth. I'm making these again for the 4th of July cookout we are having, but I think that I will triple the recipe, since we didn't have leftovers this time around.",

I served it with pound cake and fresh whipped cream but honestly I could just eat a bowl of these strawberries. You definitely want to let them sit for at least an hour and stir then at least every ten minutes because this is what creates the yummy juice that makes a great sauce when poured over cake. The cake soaked it up so it had the flavor of the strawberries too. I am going to make this again and again while it's still strawberry season!",
