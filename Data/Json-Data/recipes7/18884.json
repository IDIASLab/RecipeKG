It's clear from the texture and taste of the final product that this recipe is a winner. No grapeseed oil so I subbed canola oil. No orange so I added lime and grapefruit zest. Frozen thawed raspberries on hand so in they went. Used 1 cup white all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat all purpose flour-personal preference. Recipe made 12 regular sized muffin on the larger size. And the cat is playing with a fresh cranberry that was accidentally dropped so it's a win there too except when it rolls under an appliance. Great recipe with lovely flavour in the muffin.",
