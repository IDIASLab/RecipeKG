I use organic cane sugar and instead of corn syrup I use Organic gluten free Brown Rice Syrup which has a bit of a caramel flavor to it. I use organic peanut butter and dry roasted gluten free peanuts from Costco. I do add a few TBS of butter to the coating because I think it gives it a better texture. And I omit the butterscotch chips...it would be too sweet that way. This way it's a great combination of salty and sweet crunchy and chewy. Using the organic/non gmo ingredients does make it pricer but I just don't go for gmo. I've made this a couple of times and it was a hit!",

The butterscotch chips almost seized up on me in the microwave so I stirred in a bit of cream to add some moisture and it still did not spread very easily. I m not convinced the butterscotch chip topping was an asset to this candy and thought it took the sweetness level over the top But in all fairness to the recipe I used honey nut corn flakes which on their own added some sweetness. if I used it again I d go ahead and melt the chips in a double boiler. Maybe just a drizzle of a small amount of melted chocolate or butterscotch chips might work a little better?? This didn t quite measure up to my expectations but it still was OK",
