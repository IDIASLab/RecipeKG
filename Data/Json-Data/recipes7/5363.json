I always make recipes exactly as written the first time then play with it if I think it could be improved. NO PLAYING this time around!

I still think next time I will soak overnight. That being said couldn't come up with the ranch beans used a can of hot chili beans instead. Put two hot home canned peppers cut in half in with the rest of the mix. Used regular vinegar out of apple cider kind! And totally forgot the bell pepper( which was ok anyway). Put over white rice with some cheese and scallions some cornbread and Mmmmmmmm. Good stuff Danger thanks! Oh one more thing the dried onions.. next time I will use regular onions I just like onions in with my pinto beans. I did cook this on high for 4 hours I just couldn't wait to taste it.",

I ended up using 1 qt 1 can of chicken broth (instead of water) plus about 2-3 cups of water. I also forgot about the green onion but doubt that mattered. Great Beans!",
