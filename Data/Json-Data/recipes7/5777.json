Used whole wheat flour instead of white (I never cook with white flour). A few comments mascarpone cheese is very thick like the consistency of cream cheese you want to let it soften so it is easier to work with. A hand mixer would probably be best for the topping I didn't use one & mine came out sort of grainy. My husband commented the topping wasn't sweet enough. Be careful with the food coloring if you have light countertops. As I squeezed it out as it got to the end it splattered a bit getting all over the counter. Luckily I had a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser a regular sponge did not get it off. Lastly Written as is this recipe is too much work for amount yielded I recommend doubling it if you're making it. We got 9 medium size pancakes out of the batter the griddle was very full.",

The combination of buttermilk with baking soda or baking powder WILL produce a red-ish tint naturally. Just mix them together and wait a few minutes. It will be a little lighter than food color (for goodness sake!) but it will be as the cake was intended. If you really 'need' a blood red color try beet juice. It just takes a few drops.",

One usually makes changes/substitutes out of necessity--not having all the required ingredients at least when making the recipe for the first time. I was married to a certified European chef for nearly 18 yrs. and he always went with the 'original' on any recipe. Changes if any came after he prepared it for the first time.",
