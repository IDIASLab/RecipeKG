The sour cream flavor doesn't come through or make it taste 'sour'. My guess is it's used for moisture. The cream cheese filling is light and almost bread-like with the addition of the 3 Tbsp flour. So it's not like a cheese Danish with a big blob of cream cheese in the middle. It's absolutely perfect. The only change I made was a few swipes of fresh nutmeg on the microplane just because.",
