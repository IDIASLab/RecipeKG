An even more outstanding combination and I didn't roll them in sugar either. They are on the sweet side so I made a batch with out the chips and they were good rolled in sugar. I recommend chilling the dough in a log shape with plastic wrap store in your fridge to have handy for a quick batch of cookies! They make a great crispy cookie (with out the chips) if you make them smaller and cook them longer. Otherwise they are a wonderful chewy and spicy cookie!",
