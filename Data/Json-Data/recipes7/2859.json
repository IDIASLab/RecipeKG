I'm just not sure the kids are going to get any of these. It would be a shame to allow anybody but me to eat them:) great without frosting or with.

I can't wait til they're cooled down completely and the chocolate chips are solid again.(UPDATE: These are awesome once the chips have solidified again). They're quite good and so ridiculously simple to make. The only thing I did differently was I used one less egg and the syrup I accidentally bought the other day (sugar free). It had a slight wang to it but the flavor was really good. I took away an egg to try to make them denser and less cake like but they were still a lil fluffy with the exception of the center pieces because I undercooked them by about 5 minutes to make them fudgier. Thanks for the recipe will definitely make these again. UPDATE: 4 days later and the entire batch I made is GONE so I am making another batch of these yummy brownies! This time I did 1 1/2 times the recipe so they'd last a little longer. My husband and daughter LOVED these as did I. I forsee making a lot of these in my future as the demand seems to be high for them!:)",

I had recently mad another recipe that was almost bitter chocolate flavor. I would definitely put in the chocolate chips if I were to try it again because I think they need the extra \"chocolaty moisture.\" They did have a good flavor though...thanks Kristin.",
