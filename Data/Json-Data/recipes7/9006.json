Here is what I adjusted: ColeSlaw: 3/4 cup mayo; 2 tablespoons of lemon juice; 2 - 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar; Everything else was the same. My husband did not like the pepperoncini peppers in the coleslaw. Pulled Pork: 2 teaspoons of kosher salt; 2 teaspoons of black pepper; 2 teaspoons of granulated garlic; 2 teaspoons of granulated onion; 1 teaspoons of cayenne pepper; 1 teaspoon of allspice; 16 ozs. of apple juice; I cooked the pork in the crockpot for 8 hours. Every other measurement of other spices remained the same. Sauce: Followed the recipe for the sauce adding some of the apple juice/meat juices to the sauce. The dinner turned out awesome. I have cooked enough to know that amount of spices written in this recipe would have been overwhelming. -Karen J 0606",
