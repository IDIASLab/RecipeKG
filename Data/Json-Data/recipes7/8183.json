Also, I used a little less onion than the recipe called for, and I used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Next time I will use more parmesan cheese to completely cover the greenish/brownish color of the onions and green beans, and maybe even mix some in with the green beans in addition to the top for extra flavor.  I will definitely make this again!",

Instead, I used just 1/4 tsp sugar and it was way too sweet for us.  Salt and pepper was added to the onions with the garlic tossed in at the end of caramelizing so it would not burn and be bitter.  A quick broil to melt the cheese and roast the tomatoes would save cook time.",

I did scale the recipe down to about 6 servings for just two of us then the leftovers were warmed on the grill and served with burgers for a lovely lunch outside Used pink himalayan salt  for the  boiling water and had no  problem with  bland green beans.  Also had a very nice aged balsamic from a speciallty store so did not add the sugar.  I prefer red onions  and was  liberal with the cheese.  Great combination of flavors, easy to put together and with fresh tomatoes out of gardens this casserole will be over the top. Made and reviewed for the Alphabet Tag game.",
