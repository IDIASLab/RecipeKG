I added some fresh ginger puree and also ground.  I added freshly ground nutmeg as well. I had to boost the cinnamon also.\n\nJust use pumpkin pie spice and if you have none, use one of the two recipes here on the site.  One uses all spice and one does not.\n\nMake sure you're using a \"pie\" or \"sugar\" pumpkin.  A better way to cook the pumpkin, in my opinion, is to roast it.  Wash it, slice off the stem, place it flat-side down (where you just cut off the stem), and slice in half.  Gut it (save the seeds for roasted seeds!), and place it face down on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper.  Roast at 425 for about an hour, until the peel is wrinkly and loose.  Cool slightly, and the peel just come right off. Then puree it in a food processer, blender, or push through a ricer.\n\nThen take that puree and make the butter.\n\nI also added butter to my recipe, which made it richer.  A bit of vanilla extract brightens it, too.",

I had baked my pumpkin before coming across this recipe. So I slow cooked for abour 4 hours on low then used the immersion blender to make it smooth. Extremely easy and made the house smell good! I did use brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. I just eyeballed the spices and tasted if it needed more. Remember to use a little bit of spices at a time you can always add more if it needs it. We used it on homemade biscuits in oatmeal on french toast too. So good!",
