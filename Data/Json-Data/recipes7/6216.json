I also increased the baking powder to a full teaspoon and used pecans instead of walnuts. I made muffins out of this recipe, I was able to get 18 muffins. I did bake them at 350 for just about 22 minutes. This recipe turned out moist and delicious--I'm really glad I thought to increase the cocoa powder. My kids both thought it needs more chocolate chips. I think I could get away with cutting back the sugar by half next time and increasing the chocolate chips, maybe use mini-chocolate chips.",

One thing I've noticed is the Chocolate chips and nuts take on the flavor of the Zucchini more so than the actual bread does.  It's almost like eating Coco Puffs...but it's pretty epic...I'll be making this again when fresh pumpkin is out of season :D",
