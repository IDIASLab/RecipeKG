I have to admit that I was slightly skeptical about using the full 2 tsp of baking soda (it seemed a little much for the amounts of the other ingredients) but I did use the full 2 tsp and even though the batter tasted a little soda-y, the final product did not.  It was perfect.  I did make a couple of minor changes in that I did not use the pecans at all and I baked these at 325 degrees instead of 300.  I got 18 regular sized cupcakes out of this recipe.",

Best version of banana bread I've ever had, and I've tried a LOT.  i would've given it five stars except that I modified it quite a bit.  Instead of three bananas I only used two and added a box of banana pudding mix.  Since the pudding was drier than a banana would be I took out about a quarter cup of flour. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla and instead of buttermilk I used Mexican crema.  I love experimenting and this time I think it really paid off!",

The only change I made was I used applesauce in place of the oil I ground the nuts so they blended into the muffin and I added about 2 tableoons of fax seed and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Oh and about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips! Yummy. I made a batch yesterday and there are only 3 left. About to make a second batch now. Will be making these alot! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also added a little vanilla which was recommended from one of the reviews and 3/4 c sugar instead of the full cup which was also recommended. The batter made 12 cupcakes and 6 doughnuts. If I can stop eating them right out of the oven I will add cream cheese frosting. I also like that this recipe isn't too overpowering with banana flavor. Happy baking!",

I followed the recipe except that I used just under a full cup of sugar and I didn't want to buy buttermilk for only 3 tbsp since I don't bake often. I looked up a buttermilk substitute and found I could use 1 tbsp white vinegar or lemon juice in a measuring cup and then fill with milk to the 1 cup mark let stand for 5 minutes and then used 3 tbsp of that. Turned out beautifully! I also chose not to use pecans. These took 17 minutes in the oven at the stated temperature and yielded 3 1/2 dozen (42) mini cupcakes. I also added a cream cheese frosting and a bit of blue and green decoration. Perfect for the little people and moms I was feeding at my son's 1st birthday playdate and we have lots to share with the neighbours!",
