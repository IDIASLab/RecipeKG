We always have dessert with Sunday dinner, so I was looking for something VERY easy, and this certainly was that.  I went to the store right when it opened this morning, and peaches were $3.49 lb and not really ripe enough to eat today. I just bought a can of peach slices, drained them but reserved the liquid, and that actually worked out pretty well.  I checked the pot at 1-1/2 hours, and it was starting to crust up on the bottom  and was pretty dry.  Added some of the reserved peach liquid, gave it a good stir, and 30 minutes later, this was good-to-go.  Exactly what I was looking for today, enjoyed it, and a great use of the slow cooker.",
