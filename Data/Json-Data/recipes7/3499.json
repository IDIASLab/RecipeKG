                "reviewBody": "Oh my, these are finger lickin' good!  I may be a Northern girl, but I do know a good rib when I taste one.  The key to a really good rib is in the rub and this rub is great! I actually made extra and put it in a small jar to have on hand. I did change one major thing though and that was the amount of salt - I cut way back on that; 1 & 1/2 tsp. for the full recipe.  The rest of the recipe is a matter of taste.  I used 1 Tbsp each of the black and white peppers, but really you could leave it alone.  We have a smoker, but if you don't use whatever you have - gas or charcoal grill with a lid.  If you do use a grill, wrap the ribs in foil and put a thin layer of BBQ sauce on the bottom of the foil before wrapping to prevent the ribs from sticking. Place them on the grill on low heat, cover, and let them cook for about two - three hours or until done. Unwrap them and finish directly on the grill basting the ribs in the remaining BBQ sauce. As far as the BBQ sauce is concerned again use what you have or like.  I didn't have apple juice so I added a splash of apple cider vinegar, a splash of liquid smoke along with the brown sugar to some Bull's Eye BBQ sauce I had (I doubled the amount the recipe called for). These were absolutely fabulous, fall off the bone good - perfect with coleslaw and cornbread.",

Here is what I did: I used 1 tablespoon of the pepper and white pepper. I used slightly less than the 1/4 cup of salt...lets say 1/4 minus 1 tablespoon. I used 1/2 of the cumin because I agreed with another reviewer that the cumin would of been too strong otherwise. Next time when I try this recipe I am going to buy the frozen 100% apple juice and use it undiluted I believe it will bring out a sweeter intensity that I would prefer. I also used apple chips to smoke with and that was great. The meat was fall off the bone good and it was plenty spicy so I was glad I had cut those peppers in half.",

Not knowing what to expect, I asked my wife & her family to have something else ready for dinner that night. \n\nThis recipe made me look like a hero. The ribs came out perfectly....even though I did not follow the recipe exactly (I did not marinate the ribs in plastic in the refrigerator as listed). I added apple chips every time I was basting (soaked only for 20 minutes) & left the top vent open fully. \n\nI would suggest that you check the meat after 4 hours...my smoker cooked it faster than expected. Most importantly, cover the ribs in foil...this really adds to the flavor. The best part of the recipe is the aroma that your house receives when brining in the ribs...\n\nThanks again!",

I found the blend of herbs beautiful I say a less on the cumin my husband said no. He thougt the cumin was dead on. After readiing others reviews the cumin was the topic. I guess it depends on how much you love cumin. We are fans. I needed a fast recipe. I did not have time to marinate. I rubbed the ribs did let them sit for 30 minutes pacing then roasted in the oven at 325 degrees for about 1 hour 15 minutes. This rub did not need sauce the fat from the ribs allowed me to roll them for juiceness though the boys wanted me to smear some BBQ sauce on them so I did. Just added to the whole experience. They were very good and I will use it again when I don't have time to think ahead of time. Great blend of dried spices. Thumbs up!",
