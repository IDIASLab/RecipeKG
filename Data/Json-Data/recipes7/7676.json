I cooked these in my cast iron skillet--instead of spooning 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet I used 1/4 cup. I also used a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar mix on top of the pancake. Cooking them in the cast iron skillet gave the pancakes this wonderful crust that was absolutely amazing. The kids and I adored these pancakes--we literally ate ourselves silly with these this morning. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER.",
