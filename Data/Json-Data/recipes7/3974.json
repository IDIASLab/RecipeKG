I used a moscato which is an extremely sweet wine to begin with so I use 1/2 the sugar. I recommend superfine or powdered sugar which dissolves more easily. I zest the citrus into the liquid before cutting the fruit which puts more fruit flavor in the sangria. I don't use grapes because I don't think they absorb the wine nor add flavor to the mix. I save adding the soda until just before serving to keep the fizz. Club soda is good but sometimes I use ginger beer (from Trader Joe's) for a nice spicy snap. Salud!",
