I then scooped out the squash and added it to the broth and used electric mixer until smooth and added 1 cup of half and half.  I served it with crumbled bacon. Delicious!!",

I did puree it with my stick blender because I preferred that texture and wanted a thicker soup.  Also, since I own goats, I make a lot of chevre. I used that instead of the cream cheese, and goat milk instead of the cream.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing.",
