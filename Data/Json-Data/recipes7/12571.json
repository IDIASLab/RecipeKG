Turns out we loved it!\" Despite its bright yellow hue I am still surprised at how much we adored this meal. I had to toss in a handful of frozen green beans (would've preferred peas but was out) during the last 5 min. boil w/ the chicken b/c the color was so off-putting. I halved the recipe for 3 of us and we ate every last sloppy bit pouring what seemed to be a ton of the sauce over a blend of quinoa and brown rice. Even w/o the addition of the green beans it would've tasted just as wonderful and there's no question that when I give something 5 stars it's definitely going in the keeper file!",
