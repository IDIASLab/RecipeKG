I also lined my loaf pan with parchment paper so the edges could stay nice & moist, not overly crusty.  And a dash of cinnamon certainly helped with the lovely aroma.",

Bread was moist and wonderfully flavorful.  I originally made it to have something to go with my cranberry butter but the bread was so good by itself I forgot about the butter!
