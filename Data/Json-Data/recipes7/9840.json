When I got older - and had long since abandoned real cocoa for the instant variety - I had a craving one night for a more wholesome treat. Here's my recipe for a creamier, homestyle cup of cocoa. Perfect for those snowy winter nights!",

I did add about a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips when adding the milk & half and half.  The dark chocolate chips melted into the mixture as I was stirring, and they gave the hot chocolate a rich chocolate flavor.  I can't wait to share a cup of cocoa with my husband who has been out plowing snow on this frigid December day.  Thanks, Katherine-Ann!",

Depending on how chocolatey you like your cocoa from my personal opinion I think it was very chocolatey. I love chocolatey hot cocoa but this one was a little off it could have been from me skipping the half-and-half. To make it not so chocolatey I put 3 tablespoons of water(in my one helping) and 5 tablespoons of whipped cream. It helped but not as much because it tasted like watered down hot cocoa. I personaly would not make this again. One of my favorite recipes for hot cocoa is Classic Hot Chocolate from Food Network; Yeilds: 4-6 servings Ingredients: 3 cups milk 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 pinch Kosher salt 6 ounces milk chocolate chopped 1 tsp pure vanilla extract Marshmallows or whipped cream for topping Directions: 1. Combine milk heavy cream sugar cocoa powder and salt in a medium saucepan. 2. Cook over medium heat whisking occasionally until the sugar and cocoa powder dissolve and the milk is steaming; do not boil. 3. Whisk in half of the chopped chocolate until melted then whisk in the remaining chocolate until smooth. 4. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla. 5. Pour into mugs top with marshmallows or whipped cream and enjoy!",
