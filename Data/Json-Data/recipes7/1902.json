I followed the recipe to a T except for using an 11x7 inch baking dish using soy milk and using half of a vanilla pod instead of the vanilla sugar. Tried it warm about 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven and it was perfect. The baking time was spot on. I too am excited to try it cold tomorrow. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will make for years to come! Update: I tried this cold after it was in the fridge all night. Surprisingly I like it MUCH better warm or at room temperature.",
