My father-in-law used to make it with white/patty-pan squash, but I have used many kinds: zucchini, white, yellow crookneck, spaghetti squash, and even pumpkin, all with great results, even sometimes mixing two squashes. Most people trying this would not believe it is squash. Enjoy! Serve warm.",

Its size in relationship to the meringue looks uninspiring; but its depth of flavor and texture complement the sweetness and lightness of the meringue. This is the taste of the fresh eggyolk custards I remember eating as a child with the nice addition of the rest of the egg in the meringue. This recipe and the Southern Summer Squash Pudding from this site have made me rethink my dislike of yellow squash as a vegetable. Critique: I did taste a slight saltiness in the custard and might reduce the salt next time I make this recipe.",
