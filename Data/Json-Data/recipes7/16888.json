Caution to those new to using coconut milk though - it is much richer and thicker and creamier than your typical milk and you may not be able to drink a full mug (I can't). But it certainly hits the spot when you want to indulge a bit and are craving something chocolatey dessert-y creamy and/or sweet. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate almond milk to make it go a little further and thin it out as my coconut milk was very thick to begin wtih. I also used dutch cocoa instead of dark chocolate. For spices I omitted curry and added 1/2 tsp turmeric 1/2 tsp cinnamon a 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few sprinkles of all spice. I sweetened with stevia as I can't have sugar. 1/2 tsp for the batch did me fine. The whole batch gave me one very full mug's worth.",
