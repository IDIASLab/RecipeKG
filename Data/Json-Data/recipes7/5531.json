I will say my 1/4 cup of lemon juice was almost a 1/3 cup cause the two lemons I had were JUICY! So I just put it all in the batter. I had to \"scoop\" the batter also but that allowed me get good portions to surround the filling. Only thing I would add is make some candied lemon peel for a garnish & I balanced the lemon with a basic vanilla buttercream. Kind of reminded me of a lemonhead candy...maybe I'll garnish with that candy next time.",
