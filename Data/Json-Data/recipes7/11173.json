When they were done baking they were standing up way above the liners and I wondered how I was going to put the sour cream topping on them but they calmed down and made a perfect little dent for me to fill them (were mine not done enough?). I was able to put two teaspoons of the sour cream onto each of the cupcakes using the ingredients called for. I think I would cut the eggs to 4 and add more vanilla to the mix. I liked that these came out gluten free for some of the people I was serving. Thanks Poppy127!",

I live in Guatemala and most everyone loves cheesecake but what is normally available here isn't all that great in my opinion. Should be fun to see how these little babies are received tomorrow. Update: Wow!! I brought home a few crumbs and requests for more in the future. Don't hesitate to make these if you want an elegant and special dessert. You will not regret them.",
