If you're looking for lots of banana taste you would have to play around with the recipe or go back to quick bread. I might use more cinnamon more raisins and a tsp of vanilla next time but that's all preference. Also I used half whole wheat flour. Thanks Oz for this great recipe!",

It really is more banana flavored white bread than \"banana bread\". Next time I make it I intend to try with 3 bananas to see if that makes it better. I hesitate to add more sugar because I don't know if that would feed the yeast too much but it could certainly be sweeter.",

I have diverticulitis so everything with seeds nuts hard to digest foods have to be processed in my Nutri-bullet. Still I add twice the raisens but eat in moderation!
