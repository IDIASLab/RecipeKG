This recipe is so so very easy to make. I cooked at normal using the slow cooker feature on my Instant Pot checked at 3 hours (could ve been done even sooner) and it was shreddable. I then switched to less and cooked for one more hour. The mojo and sour orange marinades combined with the juice coming from the rump roast is so darn flavorful that it knocked my socks off (well if I d been wearing socks today it s flip flops). When serving be sure to serve that marinade/sauce with the meal don t let an ounce of it go to waste. I left the meat a little chunky just personal preference. Served with cilantro-lime rice black beans with chopped onion olives and a loaf of Cuban bread bought at a Tampa Cuban bakery. I think this would be equally good made with pork loin instead of beef. Mojo pork is something you often find at Cuban restaurants. At any rate this is the real deal folks. Katie this one s a winner well done!",
