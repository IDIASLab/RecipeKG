A few helpful hints:\n- When the recipe above doesn't turn out well, raise temperature and simply try again. \n- The setting temperature for agar is considerably lower than the temperature at which it melts. This makes it useful for hot gels should you wish to do so by warming up the gel after it has set.\n- For the average gelatine, typically one would use 0.5% by weight of agar powder. Sugar enhances the gelling power; tannins reduce it. The small amount needed makes it practical to either use precision scales or pouches with a known amount of agar in them.\n- For an extra fast gelatin, heat only a third of the liquid you want to set, then add in the remaining two thirds of the liquid (at room temperature) while stirring . This will brings the agar near its setting temperature (32-40 degrees C or about 95-110F), reducing the setting time by hours.",
