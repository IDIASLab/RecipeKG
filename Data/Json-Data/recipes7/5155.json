They aren't traditional, but they were a hit and instantly became a favorite with the hubby and me. Burgers can also be cooked on the stovetop.  Grilling will add a nice flavor, and I prefer charcoal for a nice smoky finish.",

I'm also thinking of turning the burger part into meatballs for bento lunches.",

I couldn't find mirin so I used Sherry with an equal part of sugar dissolved in it. for the tamari I used soy sauce. I thought I had ginger at home turns out I didn't so I used pickled ginger and for the sesame oil which I also thought I had I substituted chili oil. I was surprised how amazing this burger turned out considering I didn't have half of the ingredients but my god was it amazing!! I definitely plan on making this again!",
