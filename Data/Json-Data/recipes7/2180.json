When beating together butter and sugar, make you are do it for a good 3-4 minutes.  It will get noticeable lighter.  Also cut the flour a little bit.  Finally, only add a pinch of salt.  Enjoy!",

As per another reviewers suggestion, I used only 6 tbs butter and added 1/2 c whole milk (still used 3 eggs!). I baked the cupcakes for the full 25 minutes and they were perfect! Not at all muffiny. Only a couple made it until the next day, and they were still great. We used buttercream frosting and that was a bit heavy for the cupcake, so maybe next time I'll try something new.

These were still buttery cupcakes even with these lighter adjustments. I made icing with 8oz cream cheese 2 cups powdered sugar and dash of vanilla extract and topped with strawberries. Good like a strawberry shortcake not a typical cupcake flavor or texture. I will make again as they were a hit for my neice's 3rd birthday =)",
