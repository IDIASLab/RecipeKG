Putting everything into a food processor made it quick to make and clean up. It turned out to be a tasty treat topped with whipped cream. It is very moist and soft. Adding coconut or nuts gives it texture. Serve topped with whipped cream or dusted with powdered sugar.",

I food processed these to make them crumbly, but then I used a hand mixer to mix everything else. Everyone loved it and felt the density was similar to a dessert bread or loaf. I add mini chocolate chips to the cool whip topping to dress it up a bit. Enjoy!",

I made the following changes: I used 3 packages of the (Aldi brand soft baked chocolate chip cookies. They are the copycat version of the allergy friendly enjoy life brand) I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened baking cocoa powder, increased the cinnamon and vanilla at least double, Earth balance vegan butter, (on another occasion I also used oil. Once I used coconut another it was whatever I had on hand but when I make it the total \"oil\" is about 3/4- to about 1 cup.  And I also used almond milk this time but I think I've also used cashew milk. Then I added enjoy life chocolate chips on top of the batter and baked. I'm also going to try this out with different flavor varieties of the enjoy life soft baked cookie varites. I think the other cookies would work well also I just have not tried. Every person has loved, loved loved this when I made it.",
