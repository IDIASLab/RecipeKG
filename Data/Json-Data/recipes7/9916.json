I used 24 dried figs and made only a half recipe (1 cup spread), which I reconstituted with boiling water for about 10 minutes.  I also added some water to the pan after adding the chopped figs to the onion in the pan and let them simmer away for about another 10 minutes, when the all the liquid evaporated and the figs were pretty soft.  I followed the recipe to the letter after that and ended up mashing the mixture a bit with my pastry blender instead of processing (tip from mis7up).  I also used light brown sugar.  I froze the spread and plan to put on my fruit and cheese tray for Christmas Eve.  Thanks for the recipe, Thea.",

So when my figs broke down they were still a tad chunky, I finished the cooking process and then pulsed the batch a couple of times in my Ninja and there was a great thick, tangy sweet oniony spread. My girls and I liked it, but I am on guard.....don't want to share! For some reason this recipe reminds me of my childhood. I don't know if my Nana ever made this but, for some reason, it reminds me of her. And I can tell you, this will be come a cherished treat for me. TY....TY! A great pairing of savory and sweet without it being overly sweet or tart, it was right on the money! And yes, I did add the sugar!",
