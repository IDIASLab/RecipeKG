Sorry but my husband still wouldn't try it but I think if he did he'd like it! I used fresh green beans and blanched them - don't cook them too much if you like them with a little more bite (as I do - I hate mushy green beans) b/c they'll further cook in the oven in the soup mixture. I couldn't find BACON cheese spread but mixed crumbled bacon into regular cheese spread and spooned that on top. It was so good! I am not a processed cheese devotee but once in a while it's yummy - in this especially! I'll make this again.",
