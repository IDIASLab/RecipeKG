This recipe did have that slight taste but it was super moist which was nice. I love the use of applesauce. I made cupcakes instead of a cake because of the event I was making them for. Took about 14 minutes in the oven rotating the sheet halfway through. I topped the cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting and they were extremely delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe it will definitely be made again!",

I use JULES AP GF flour mix instead of all the different flours listed (2 1/2 cups), eliminate the xanthan gum as JULES has that covered in her flour mix. and I use the pretty cupcake liners for the muffin cups for easy clean-up.  To make them dairy-free I use almond or soy milk + 1 Tbsp vinegar to = the buttermilk. I also am now adding 2 Tbsp of  \"cake enhancer\" by King Arthur Flour to make them stay fresh longer. It is a great product and gluten-free.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

The texture is good and there is no strange aftertaste like sometimes happens with gluten-free baked goods. They were a hit at the party as well. The guest of honor said they were the best gluten-free cupcakes she had ever had. Her sister ran over to tell the guest of honor not to eat them as she was convinced they couldn't be gluten free after eating them. For people who plan to make cupcakes this recipe will make about 2 dozen. Another reviewer said the batter was thick like dough. I did not find that to be the case at all. It had a normal cake batter texture.",

This is the best cake that I've EVER made in my life gluten free or not. So moist. Freezes well too. 2 tips: do as others suggested and use sugar to coat your muffin tins after spraying with cooking oil instead of flour which slightly sweetens the cake and they'll fall out of the tin easily. Using room temperature ingredients makes a HUGE difference. Don't skip that step. Make your own buttermilk with vinegar instead of buying some and save the money for all the flours. This is a keeper.",
