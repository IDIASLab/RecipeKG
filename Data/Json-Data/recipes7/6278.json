We probably could have reduced the sugar a little bit more. I also added soy sauce to the sauce which I think it needed. We used chicken broth instead of beef broth. We didn't have green onions or cilantro to put on top like traditional pad Thai, but we did top it with crushed peanuts. This was amazing for our first attempt at pad Thai.",

I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because it is what I had in the pantry.  I also used a tablespoon of lime juice in place of one of the tablespoons of vinegar and added a little bit of soy sauce to cut the sweetness.  I think next time I will use honey or agave in place of half of the sugar.  I added quite a bit of red pepper flakes and some sriracha because we like it hot!  Otherwise, this is a wonderful recipe....a great basic pad thai recipe that you can amend to your taste.",

I'd use 1/4 cup of sugar and 3 tablespoons of fish sauce at first THEN you can always taste it and add more if you need.
