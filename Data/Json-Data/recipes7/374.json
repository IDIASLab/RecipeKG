My only change (ingredient wise) was that the diced tomatos had basil oregano and garlic already mixed in which added fantastic flavor!

Before serving I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on the top. Fabulous.",

I did an \"oops\" with the cayenne pepper which doesn't bother my family much and the tomato sauce I had were 8oz cans so I felt like it could have been better with a little more tomato sauce. Oh since I made it on my stove I sauteed the onions & celery. Then browned the ground beef. Then added it all together in a large skillet and let it simmer a few minutes. It was good and I will be making it again. Thanks!",
