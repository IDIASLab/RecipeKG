I made this exactly as written and it worked out fine however next time I will use self-rising flour instead of all-purpose because I feel that it works better in these types of recipes. The Amish don't use a lot of seasonings or spices other than salt & pepper so you may want to top these with a sprinkle of cinnamon & sugar if you like that sort of flavor. Otherwise this is a great recipe that I will make again.",

Our favorite was mountain blackberry, but Meijer was having a sale on peaches, haha.\n For this recipe, I had to add more flour to the batter to get the dough at the right consistency. You really want it thicker than pancakes but a tad thinner than biscuits so you can get it off the spoon. Dip your spoon in flour before you start so you aren't \"beating the devil\" out of your pot. You could also use Bisquick if you have it, I never use it, but my auntie always did. I also added brown sugar, ground cloves, and apple pie spice as it was simmering for more flavor. Note: it's better to spice towards the end, you get more from your spices, just stir and break up your dumplings when they're finished setting to distribute the spices. I also subbed in 1/2 c buttermilk and 1/2 c 2% milk to get the dumplings to taste more authentic as I was mixing them, like a buttermilk biscuit- it also helps with texture, I learned that from working at Cracker Barrel! My husband loves this and so do I! I highly recommend my tips to take this to the next level!",

Regardless of the origin it's absolutely delicious! I add cinnamon and a little nutmeg to the dumpling dry ingredients. One thing I would suggest is to make sure your pot is large enough to accommodate the expansion of the dumplings. I had to change pots midway through to avoid a boil over (and a scolding from the wife). I use canned peaches (2) in light syrup. I drain the syrup into a measuring cup then add enough water for 2 cups. I also reduce the sugar called for by about a tablespoon or two due to the light syrup (to taste). For a real treat use the raspberry flavored peaches (made by Del Monte) if you can find them.",
