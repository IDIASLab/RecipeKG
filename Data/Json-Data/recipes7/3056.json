But my tiny (not even that) garden produced a few tomatoes & cucumbers and I was at loss what to do with them. so I typed \"tomato sauce\" and I came up with this one.. I am a beginner bad one at that. I am far better at booking restaurant reservation than knowing kitchen jargons. ie. I know when I taste good one but I would never be able to cook one. Well this tastes great when I cooked it.. I am thinking I can eat this with chips perhaps french bread if all fail I will just eat this sauce as a meal. WONDERFUL!",
