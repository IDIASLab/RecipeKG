I had two bowls for dinner, and I'm going to have another bowl for a snack tonight! By the way, be sure you get the jumbo 28 oz. size of coleslaw mix as called for in this recipe, rather than the standard 16 oz. size. (P.S. I like a hint of onion in my slaw, so I minced 2 Tbs. of onion and added that to the coleslaw mix.)",

Like another reviewer, I like a bit of onion in my slaw so added some minced onion as well, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was a big hit at our \"autumn picnic\" at work! Next time I make it I will make sure to have enough horseradish on hand for even more zip! Do pay attention to how much slaw is in the package you use (since most aren't 28 oz.) or you will have way too much dressing. I always mix the dressing in one bowl and put the slaw in another and add til I get the consistency I want. Definitely my go to slaw now!",
