It's  a perfect complement to get that sweet and spicy flavor with other sauces like sambal oelek or gochujang.

The sauce will thicken considerably once cool.\n\nI wasn't able to find soy glaze at my local supermarket, and the price to order it online seemed a bit silly once I knew the exact ingredients.

It's a process and when followed according to this recipe, you can't go wrong.  I made a full recipe and put the leftover in a glass jar.\nThe next timer I want to make a Blue Apron recipe that needs this ingredient, I'll be prepared instead of having a panic attack.",
