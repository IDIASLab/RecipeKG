I don't like the crumb topping regardless so I either make them plain or pull them out a couple minutes early brush the tops with beaten egg white and sprinkle raw sugar on for the last couple minutes of baking. These were ok. I used homemade applesauce that was thicker than store-bought so that might be some of the issue. To me for the few calories you save just make the real ones and enjoy them.
