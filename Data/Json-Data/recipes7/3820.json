I dont use liguid pectin I only use sure jell. On concentrate you use 5 & 1/4 cups sugar on this recipe I only used 5 and turned out great...Oh and to get rid of scum or the nasty fuzz stuff on top my mother in law said if you use 1/2 teaspoon of real butter when you start cooking the butter eliminates the scum so you dont have to skim it before putting it in jars",
