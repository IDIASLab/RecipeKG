Made this recipe exactly as written and was a little disappointed with the taste and texture. I found this drier and less moist (and I didn't overcook) than my favorite corn breads and quite honestly I was expecting more of a punch from the fresh cranberries. This is by no means a bad recipe just for my own personal preference it was a bit of letdown.",
