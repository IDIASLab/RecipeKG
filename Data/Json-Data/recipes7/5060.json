It turned out wonderfully!\n\nIt also expands more than other ice cream recipes I have used.  The batch makes about 2 quarts, so I doubled it for my 4 quart freezer.  I ended up having to scoop some out when I found it was raising the lid!  Next time I'll either make a single batch or freeze a double batch in the 6 quart freezer.  I WILL make this one again though!",

I also used 1 1/2 tablespoons of lavender because my lavender was not on the stem anymore. Takes a little time to make this but worth it!!!",
