I used the suggestions of other reviewers: 1/4 cup water, 1 cup pineapple juice, and while the wings were in the oven I boiled the marinade to reduce it and thickened it with corn starch.  Once the wings were done I tossed them in the sauce reduction and they were very flavorful.  (I can see how these wouldn't have much flavor if you ate them after being cooked, without tossing them in the sauce.)  Lots of flavor....maybe a bit too sweet.  Will probably put in less sugar next time.  We will definitely be making these again.",

I also used only 3/4 cup of soy sauce (all I had left) and a few shakes of ground ginger rather than a full tablespoon of fresh. I marinaded the wings for about 3 hours. They came out superb!!!",

I marinated for the hour and then while the wings were cooking, I made more of the marinade, excluding the veggie oil, and simmered it on the stovetop, reducing it by half or until thick.  And then tossed the wings, in it, once they were done.  I will definitely make this with more wings the next time, because everyone in my house gobbled up more than they said they would!!!!",

I generally use frozen wing pieces thawed and marinated overnight but whole wings also work very well. In fact I've done nearly every part of the bird with great success. Just adjust the cooking time for bigger bit. A lot of the time I'll put the remaining marinade in a saucier and boil it down while the chicken is baking and toss it in the blender to make a smooth sauce. It's just too good to waste. With about twenty minutes left drown the chicken again. This makes eating a bit messy but it tastes out-of-this-world.",

I also used extra garlic for our personal tastes - but not needed for others. I also kept the marinade and reduced it by half and added corn starch. When I took the wings out of the oven I put them in the sauce for 5 minutes. My guests agreed they were absolutely delicious. These will definitely become a staple for my parties.",
