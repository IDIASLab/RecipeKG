The possibilitys are endless instead of strawberries you can use cantaloupe,watermelon, papayas etc,. even mangos. Yummy! My only changes: Didn't have time to put it in the refrigerator and wait 4 hrs. so I just put it in the blender and made it in two batches, used Splenda insted of reg. sugar and didn't strained like the recipe states.But I'm sure the original recipe is as delicious with no changes. It's just my personal preference. Thanks for sumitting your recipe!",

Most bottled waters with the essence of fruit flavors are really tart and don't actually have very good flavor. This did for me. I think after I sliced up all the strawberries it worked out of 2 1 pound containers about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of strawberries, so I used them all in this. You could probably make it sweeter in the step that you add the 7 cups of water but I didn't. We enjoyed. Thank you soo much.",

I've tried making fruit water without much success and clearly letting it sit long enough is the key.   \n\nWhat a refreshing treat on a hot summer day and when strawberries are in season.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2c, as others mentioned and it was sweet enough for our taste.   I was getting impatient at how long it took to strain so I just poured the remaining 7 cups water through the strainer to get every last strawberry flavoured morsel.  There was only a small spoonful of seeds left, so I definitely recommend straining it to get that wonderful smooth taste.",
