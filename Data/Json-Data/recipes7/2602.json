That seemed to work fine then you just microwave it for 10-20 seconds to warm it up the next time.",

Like another reviewer, the rating is only 4 because of the \"gloop\" factor...  it was a little stringy and had to be spread over pancakes a little...  The flavor was really tasty, but will try without the flour next time.  I added just a touch of butter as this cooked to give it some richness but otherwise followed the recipe.  Big thank you to whichever reviewer suggested putting this in coffee...  it really did give it that cinnamon dolce flavor my husband loves from the coffee place.",

It was particularly sweet, but if you are a sweet tooth (like my boyfriend) you will love it. We had this on pancakes, dutch babies, and i even put a little in the frying pan when I was frying up breakfast sausages and they came out with a salty/sweet flavor (sort of like the pre-packaged maple flavored sausages back home) - delicious!",
