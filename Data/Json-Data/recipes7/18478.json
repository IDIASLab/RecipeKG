It does not drizzle but it can be brushed onto the butternut squash. 3. You may need to adjust the roasting time depending on how large your butternut squashes are. Mine was large and it took about 20 minutes more for it to get nice and soft. 4. When moving the end result from the baking sheet to a serving dish used to large spatulas and it will be just fine.",
