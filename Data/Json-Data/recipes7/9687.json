Thanks Johnnycakes for this great idea! UPDATE 18/09/2014. This recipe works with GF corn flakes too!  I added 2 Tbsp of cocoa though. UPDATE 9 MARCH 2015: The best, tastiest, most versatile, fast and easy pie crust. Any gf cereal works. Today I made this instead of graham cracker crust by using gf rice krispies, adding cinnamon, a touch of ginger and brown sugar instead of white sugar and cocoa. It takes minutes to make and only about 15 minutes in the fridge to set, ready to be filled. Love this recipe!",
