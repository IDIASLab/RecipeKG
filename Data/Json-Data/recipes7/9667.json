As written this is very sweet - I cut the sugar to 2 Tablespoons in the apples and 2 Tablespoons in the egg batter and it was plenty sweet.  This took about 15 minutes in the 400 degree oven although I think if I had preheated my oven longer it might have been done in 10 minutes.  This comes together very fast.  I have never had the apple pancake from the Original Pancake House so I can't say how it compares.  I did not invert the pancake as the top was prettier than the bottom, next time I would plan on serving right out of the skillet.  As a dessert with ice cream this would serve 4, for breakfast it served 2.   I used a 10\" stainless steel skillet and that seemed to be the right size.   Thank you for a tasty breakfast.",

Knowing that my apple was very sweet, I cut the sugar to 2 TB when cooking the apples on the stovetop and 2 TB in the pancake mix.  That was the right amount for us.  I realized when I was putting away the ingredients, I forgot to add the cinnamon. I did serve mine \"face-up\" because the underneath wasn't pretty.  DH loved this and said \"make this anytime, as long as it is only for breakfast\".  I liked it even though I am not a fan cooked apples.  I served this with eggs - over easy.  Nice selection this week, thanks starmaster25 for sharing.",

There are a couple of notes that I would like to make.  #1 the recipe does not say what size of pan to use.  I used an 9 inch skillet and found that it was to large for the recipe.  #2 the consistence of the batter was more like that of a crepe but when I check out a crepe recipe found out that the liquid and flour ratio was even less that this.  Family has already requested that I make again which I will do but will try to have the batter more of a pancake consistence.",

Used 3 tablespoons total of sugar (1 to go with the apple if it's in season, 1 in the batter) and 1 less egg based on other reviews and that was perfect.  This is a perfect quick easy breakfast/brunch to serve for overnight guests! I made it in a cast iron skillet then traveled with it which was dumb - it kept cooking until the pan cooled so it was quite dense by the time I got there. I should have warmed the plate and then driven it on there.  UPDATE: Made this with the # of eggs called for and can confirm it's definitely too much - it came out like a fritatta. Will use 3 from now on.",

I have made this dish twice so far, and the changes I made are rather minimal: I cut the eggs down to 3 instead of 4 at the suggestion of other reviewers, and next time I think I will experiment with using a combination of whole eggs and egg whites (2 whole eggs / 1 or 2 egg whites?). It did taste a little \"egg-y\" to me as opposed to \"pancake-y\" but it was still really good. I cut down the sugar to just under 1/4 cup for the apples and 1/8 cup in the batter, and I think I could take it down even farther and it would still be sweet and delicious. I only had tiny apples so I used 2 the first time, then 3, and I would still like more apple-y goodness so I am going to add even more the next time. Oh, and I didn't know if I could bake my skillet pan (lol) so I transferred the apples and batter to a round metal pan and baked it in that. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
