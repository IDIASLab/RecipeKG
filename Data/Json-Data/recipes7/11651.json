I would have given it five stars except if you follow the recipe to the letter, I found the meat incredibly spicy! My wife is the spice lover in the family (eats jalepeno slices out of the jar) and she couldn't eat it right out of the smoker. I had to scrape off all the visible rub to make it edible for us. I will definitely cook this again, but I will use a quarter of the cayenne or I might try one brisket without the cayenne all together. With that said, if you love the heat, this recipe is perfect!! It would make an awesome spicy soft taco or wrap.",

My wife is especially sensitive to spicier foods but she had no complaints about it being too hot.  I did follow the recipe.  I used about a 12 lb brisket and had more than enough spice rub for the meat.  I was only able to rub down the meat and refrigerate for 12 hrs instead of the recommended 24 hrs and my smoking time was also less by a couple of hours.  I used pecan for my smoking wood.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks for making me look good.",
