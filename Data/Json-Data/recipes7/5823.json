Picked the cherries this morning and decided I was going to make this. I used whipped cream but would love to have had the ice cream. Next time. I had 4 cups of cherries and that worked out just fine.  I don't know why this is called a \"pudding\" cake. It isn't like any pudding cake I have ever eaten.  Made it again today, but only used 1/2 c sugar for the cherries. Still pretty sweet. I'd cut back on the sugar,.",
