I was out of almond extract so used a little rum extract. Can't really tell in the flavor though. I also used brown sugar instead of white and added in some chocolate chips along with the almonds. The house smelled so good it was hard to wait through the second baking. This recipe was really easy. I put it together in between doing other stuff. In my oven it took 50 minutes the first baking. I'll be making this again and use it as a base to try other flavors as well.",

(.(.1.).) First off it may be oven heat (mine could be hotter than 350) but even with a normal oven 8-10 minutes is wayyyy too long for toasting almond slivers. It should be about 3-5 minutes with stirring the almonds about every 1.5 minutes until you smell the toasty aroma when you open the oven. (.(.2.).) Do not mix the sugar in with the other dry ingredients. Mix sugar/eggs/vanilla&almond extract and then add the sifted dry ingredients in thirds. After each addition mix well until fully comes together. Final dough should be sticky not crumbly (which is why they include the part about shaping with flour). (.(.3.).) Watch for the bake times. 30-40 is way too long for the first bake in my opinion I would do 25-30 mins. After cutting the slices I would do 10-12 mins on each side. These should be baked not burnt to death. Again could be my stove running on the hot side but I'm making these in the dead of winter in Minnesota so it's not like there is excess heat in the air. (.(.4.).) Finally since I'm giving these as a gift I take a small cup and melt 70% cacao chocolate in the microwave (30 seconds then stir; repeat this 3 -4 times until chocolate is dissolved and runny). I dunk each biscuit in chocolate and let dry on wax paper. Adds a nice elegant touch and balances the sweetness of the almond e",
