It was a nice finish to our families holiday BBQ. I would suggest doubling the crumb crust ingredients if you want the crust to cover the sides of the cake. I used an 8-1/2\" spring form pan and the crust mixture covered only the bottom and a 1/4\" up the sides. Personally I found this to be just the right amount of crust. I will make this desert again.",
