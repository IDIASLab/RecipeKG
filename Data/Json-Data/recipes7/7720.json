        "description": "This is a famous Arabian dessert. It's more like cream caramel in texture, but it is much lighter. I wanted to share this with you guys, not only the recipe but sharing with you my Arabian roots. The rose water gives it a great flavor. Every Arabian house has its own recipe for this, not mentioning that, in Ramadan, when we Muslims fast, we must have this in our dessert table (it is essential). There are lots of ways to make it; most of us make it by it plain, while some add strawberries, some in layers with jellies, and some with cake as parfait. I make it just the way it is written. Hope you enjoy it. It's okay to replace the water and powdered milk with 3 1/2 cup of milk.",

Something about eating what I normally smell on potpourri and perfumes wasn't something I could handle after I made it. I really am trying to be subjective here. While I love the fragrance of roses...this totally took me to a new level when trying to down it in this recipe. Had I been accustom to eating this growing up I would probably have enjoy it. But putting it in my mouth and swallowing it was very off-putting when I did. I couldn't get past the one spoonful. But you don't know these things until you try them. And now I'm experienced to know I won't be making again. My apologies. This recipe will probably suit others that are accustom to eating and drinking rose water just won't be making it again in my household.",
