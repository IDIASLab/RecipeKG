The most time consuming part was using the blender to beat the refrigerated butter and sugar to a creamy consistency. The rest is easy and done by hand. Don\u2019t use a blender for the remainder or you may make a tough batter = tough cake. Stir all other ingredients in by hand until just moistened.
