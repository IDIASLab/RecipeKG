Thin crisp crust formed on the top just like the picture. Crust broke a little as I cut them but they still held together well. Very fudgy interior but not gooey. I made just a few minor tweaks to the recipe: instead of 1 extra TBL of teff I used 1 TBL tapioca flour (I ve tested this with other teff brownies recipes so I knew it helped the texture solidify). I also used only 6 TBL butter instead of the full stick with no detrimental effect to the final product. Will test with a future batch if I can get away with even less.",

Instead of butter I used canola oil, increasing it to 3/4 cup - I might cut back on that next time. I added 1/4 cup of mixed citrus peel, and 1/2 cup of coconut. I put almond extract in as well. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, I used brown sugar instead of white because I prefer the flavor. It was plenty sweet enough even with only half the sugar. With all these changes, if you cut a 9x9 pan into 16 pieces, each piece is about 150 calories.",
