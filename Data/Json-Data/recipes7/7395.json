Couldn't find any plain rum in the house so I substituted some vanilla flavored rum which went really well with the flavor of the peaches. I also substituted 1/3 cup of tapioca pudding for the 1/3 cup of flour. My great grandmother swore by tapioca to thicken pies and said you can substitute an equal amount in any recipe calling for flour. The filling thickened and the bottom crust did not get soggy. I will definitely make this again.",

The cinnamon, cardamon, and ground allspice adds so much flavor to this recipe, it makes this pie soooo --- delicious.  I did leave out the rum , and used 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  The next time I am going to use rum extact in place of the rum. This pie turned out so perfect. I would advise anyone that uses this recipe to use the fresh peaches has directed.  I would rate this recipe has a 5 star recipe.",

I ommitted the allspice and the cardamom. I also added a 1/4 more teaspoon of cinnamon 1/4 tsp. nutmeg 1 tsp. vanilla. Fresh peaches are a must. Some people don't like the taste of nutmeg if you don't like it sub with the cardamom allspice or just omitt it. Hope this helps.",
