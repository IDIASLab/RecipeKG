It is hard the first time you make it as you will be confused about mixing the milk with the dough, and it will have lumps that sink to the bottom no matter how long you beat it. the lumps form the bottom crust and the whipped egg whites form the top crust. This reminds me of a recipe called \"Impossible Pie\". Very tasty and a great way to use up milk. (got 3 milk cows)",

I didn't have cake flour so I did use all purpose flour. I don't think it had much if any effect. Ingredients should be added in a different order too. Either that or milk should be warmed before adding to mixture because I had problems with the butter (batter) clumping. In the end if you like flan you might like this.",
