Made with sweet sorghum flour and tapioca starch, these waffles will be nice and crispy on the outside, while light and fluffy on the inside! Separating the eggs is optional, but worth the extra work! Instead of regular syrup, top with apple butter, greek yogurt, or berries. My husband and son love peanut butter on their waffles. You can add 1-2 teaspoon of cinnamon for extra flavor.",

I had always considered duck eggs to be larger than chicken - and only having chicken I added one extra. Excellent waffle!!",

I used coconut milk instead of almond. I was concerned about it sticking as it doesn't have any fat in it however they didn't stick that much even without cooking spray. Crisp on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. Consistency was very close to regular waffles. I would use almond milk or dairy alternative next time to avoid the coconut flavor. Overall very good. Wonder what buckwheat flour or adding oil to them would do. I baked the whole batter and froze them so I could pull them out in the hectic mornings. Thanks for the recipe!",

The only change I made was because I didn't have applesauce I added about 2 tbsps melted butter. We cooked them with some chocolate chips and even my non-gluten friends wanted the recipe because they tasted better than the wheat ones. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. The batter is super thick (like paste) but we spread it on the waffle maker and they turned out just great. Definitely a keeper!
