I halved the recipe but used the whole can of tomato soup. The soup was good except for the pepper issue. I quartered the zucchini slices because I thought whole slices would be awkward to eat. At first I thought the extra sugar was unnecessary but added some after tasting it initially. I also added some dried basil just for my own preference. I'm not a real fan of vegetable soup but trying to eat healthy and I will make this again. Thanks!",
