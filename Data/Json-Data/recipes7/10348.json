This tastes like it was simmered long and low in order to develop such depth, yet it is so simple. There are layers of flavor that will first tease your palate with delicious savory notes that make you go mmmmm as soon as it hits your taste buds. Next, you discover the wonderful sweet undertone of the honey, making it even more interesting. Lastly, you feel the heat of the cayenne as it warms the back of your palate, but not overwhelmingly so. Perfectly balanced and wonderful. This is the kind of soup you will think about and desire long after it has been eaten up. I didn't change a single ingredient and thought it was perfect. This is going in my recipe box! Helpful hint: Use an immersion blender right in the pot to puree the soup. Save yourself the hassle and risk of burning your hands by trying to use a conventional blender. An immersion blender will soon become one of your favorite kitchen gadgets (ranks right up there with my Kitchen Aid stand mixer).",

I roasted the squash first rather than simmering it in the broth and I used a can of coconut milk in place of the half and half, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I've made it a few times and tried slight variations, it's great with either honey or maple syrup to sweeten it and I actually prefer it with vegetable broth rather than chicken broth.  I also reduce the cayenne as a personal preference, I can't handle much heat and a 1/4 tsp was a little spicy for me.",

Since I can't really eat much dairy, due to being lactose intolerant ; I wasn't sure what to use as an alternative. I tried 1/2 cup of greek yogurt. It came out too soupy. May I should have used more yogurt or tried something different. However, I forgot to use my diary free sour cream for a more  creamy texture. If it weren't so soupy it would be perfect. The cayenne pepper and curry is the best part about the flavor .",
