Changes I made:\nInstead of 1/2 t of lemon extract in the cookies, I added 1 t.\nI decided not to use the glass to flatten and just baked them in the ball shape; this took 10-11 minutes of baking. \nIcing was a tad too sweet for us so added 1/4 c whipped cream cheese to tone down the sweetness. I added 1 full t of vanilla AND lemon extract to icing; water was 1 T + 1t. (It was not too lemony.)  We did not use the nuts as we don't care for them.  Hubs wanted to make sure I kept the recipe. This will be our go-to recipe for sugar cookies from here on out!  Thanks, Gram Opal's relatives for sharing (I also love her Apple Pie recipe!) Yours truly, Gram's fan",

Finally the pecan on top is just the right touch to compliment the sweetness and add some crunch. This is quite possibly my favorite sugar cookie I have made. When I made these I realized too late that I did not have lemon extract so I used lemon zest instead. For easier cleanup I used parchment paper instead of greasing my cookie sheet. The only problem I had was the dough getting stuck to the bottom of my glass when I was flattening the cookies. This was easily solved however by dipping the glass in sugar before flattening each cookie. If you like sugar cookies I suggest trying these out!",

Everyone in the family LOVED these cookies--with and without icing. We didn't have lemon extract. Instead we added lemon zest and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract. Make no mistake these are not lemon cookies but the addition of the lemon really gave it a delicious boost. Also the icing is one of the best cookie icing recipes we ever tasted. We did need to add a little extra water than called for to make the icing spreadable. Lastly the addition of a toasted pecan on top really put this cookie over the edge! These are BY FAR the best sugar cookies we have ever made! These are going on our annual holiday cookie tray for sure! Try them today!",
