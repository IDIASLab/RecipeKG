I went with my instinct and cut the cayenne in half but it was quite spicy even halved; I did not find it enjoyable. Also there is a faint gritty-ness to the mouth feel of this yogurt recipe which I'm guessing comes from either the high amount of cinnamon and/or the cocoa powder. My husband only had a little taste and exclaimed \"blech it's got too much of something.\" It definitely does NOT taste anything like chocolate cheesecake as stated in the description. Sorry we did not care for this.",
