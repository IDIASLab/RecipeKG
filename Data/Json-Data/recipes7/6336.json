The cream filling made with cream cheese is a nice change from the usual pudding. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and used a combination of strawberries and blackberries. I also only used 3/4 of an angel food cake but all the cream filling. This completely filled my trifle bowl. I guess I need a bigger bowl but everyone seemed happy with the proportions. Thanks for a keeper!",

The changes we make are: 1) mix your torn angel food cake with one quart sweetened sliced strawberries, 2) instead of Cool Whip we whip our own cream, this cuts down on the sweetness of the desert, 3) the cream cheese is mixed with the confectioner's sugar and the whipped cream is then folded in. When layering the cake fresh strawberries sliced are always their own layer. Delicious! I believe the best thing about this recipe is its' diversity.",
