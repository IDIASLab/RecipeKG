I did what a few suggested: 1-squeeze the excess water from the zucchini, 2-at least double the spices, 3-add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 4- use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp coconut extract.  Then a couple of my own: 1- forget the sour cream, 2- forget the oil completely, 3- when you drain the pineapple, reserve the juice, 4- replace the oil with 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 3/4 cup coconut cream (available at Trader Joe's).  These are HUGE calorie reducers and add a lot of flavor.  5- I also used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, 6- toast the coconut before adding (I used 3/4 cup).  I will be making this again......real soon!",
