I ended up just putting it in the oven for 45 minutes with the foil lined pan and then as soon as the timer went off checked for the right amount of jiggle and left it in the oven with the door ajar for about another 40 minutes before I took it out. It was perfect no cracks and perfectly done. The sour cream ganache was very rich but just perfect for this sweet indulgence.",

The frosting needs the cheesecake for its sweetness. The cheesecake and the frosting together are a perfect match. The foil on the spring form pan is just to keep the water from the bath from seeping into the pan. You will definitely see a difference in the cheesecake texture if you use the bath.
