I'm Korean & galbi is always a favorite!  \n\nThe crockpot method everyone is mentioning is actually a legit Korean Dish called Galbi Chim (Braised Shortribs) Make sure and skim off the fat when it's done.. there will be a lot!  I like to use shortribs that are a few inchs across.  Makes for a nice meaty piece.  Additions of carrot, chestnut, boiler onion and potato is delish! Eat w/some steamed rice as the flavors will be pretty concentrated to eat alone.\n\nTip from my mom: remember to rinse off the ribs well before marinading.  Give the bones a good rub with your hands under some running water or you will bite in and get bone bits. Ouch! We like to just leave them in a colander to drain a bit.  Also the addition of 1/2 a grated kiwi or some pineapple will really make the meat tender if you intend to grill it.  Just make sure not to leave it in the marinade for more than a day.  I got carried away once and my meat fell apart as I was trying to put it on the grill!",

I sent some with my spouse, to serve to an elderly Korean girl friend of hers. It definitely passed the test. She loved it. She offered a suggestion...Pepsi. She told me to add Pepsi! I added about a quarter can to the recipe and it rocks! Either way it's a great, great Korean taste to die for.",

I've always made it exactly as suggested, and typically marinate it over night.\n\nA lot of people have been slow cooking this, and that's good too, but I definitely think it's best grilled. I recommend using hardwood charcoal, which burns hotter, and cooking for 3-4 minutes per side.\n\nThis cut of meat is sometimes hard to find, and even when you can, the selection can be very inconsistent -- too thick or too fatty. If it's too thick, it helps to pound it out into thinner slices.",
