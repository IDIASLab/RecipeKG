I used regular white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and tossed in some extra red bell peppers that I had on hand.  This recipe is a keeper.  Hubby wants more meat next time, and now that I know it turned out, I'll play with the veggies and the spices. This was very easy to make, the hard part was the wonderful smell while it was simmering!  Hard to wait. EDITED: Edited to add that I've now made this a number of times.  Done it with Chorizo and hambuger,  , Chorizo and sausage, and hamburger and sausage.   We've played the spice rack like a xylophone and had the veggies chunked, diced, added and subtracted.  The basic recipe is awesome and playing with it does not hurt it.",
