Also there are so many variations many people leave out the olives here to satisfy more pallets. Also I have had them with raisins and olives only one time when I was at my husbands family's home in Houston never in Bolivia. Even better are the sauces that accompany the saltenas they have usually a spicy peanut sauce an olive sauce as well as a spicy salsa and sometimes a green or avacado sauce. Also saltenas vary by region here. Thanks for the recipe.",

He snuck a second one.:) The only change I made was substituting cayenne and chilli powder for the paprika. We were out so I did 1/2 t cayenne and 1/2 t chilli powder. I didn't use that to add to the egg wash just the filling. thanks for the great recipe!",
