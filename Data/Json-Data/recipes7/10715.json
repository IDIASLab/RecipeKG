After simmering awhile i added just a little bit of hot sauce Worcestershire sauce and a splash of white wine. I simmered and stirred often for a total of 90 minutes. No salt was added since I added about 12 oz of diced smoked ham. Using a wisk to stir during the last half hour broke up the potatoes and thickened the soup to a smooth perfections. Just a splash of half and half at the end finished everything off beautifully. This is as comfort food as it gets. Try it and adjust things as you go. This was really fun to make.
