I have found it at Chinese and Vietnamese markets, but usually I get it at the China Market near my house. It's bitter so ends up going really well with a sweeter sauce.  This recipe is VERY close to what I usually do so I feel justified in reviewing it.  When I blanch my gai lan, I put in a teaspoon of salt, teaspoon of baking soda and a thick slice of ginger (or some bottled minced is good too) in the water.  For the sauce I like using some oyster sauce so it's half hoisin/half oyster.   (I use vegetarian oyster sauce purchased at the Chinese market).  I've also left out the oil and been fine, but the oil is good too.  Other than that my recipe is pretty much the same.  You could do less garlic if you don't like it, but I love garlic.",

He prefers his veggies with more of a savory sauce, so this wasn't a winner for us.  Also, the sauce was very, very thick.  I had to add water to keep it from turning into jello.  I think it might be because I used a prepared hoisin sauce from the grocery store instead of the regular kind you get at the asian market, which has the consistency of soy sauce.",
