My wife chose this for this week s pick but honestly when I looked at the ingredients I was a bit skeptical that this would come together and taste better than sweet swamp water. Boy was I surprised! It s hard to describe how the flavors blend other than to say it was well-balanced and refreshing. No one of the relatively different liquors included in this drink dominated the other. Other than using Grand Marnier instead of Triple Sec I followed the recipe as written. The only flavor that really stands out is the pineapple and even that is pleasantly subtle and not too sweet. This is a refreshing not boozy drink that can be enjoyed for just about any occasion. But just a warning depending on whether or not you really do stay up until dawn drinking this one serving was plenty for the two of us!",
