I ran this procedure by a friend and she commented that this must be a very old recipe, indeed.\r\n\r\nNone-the-less, it turns out beautifully.  I reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup in the final (third step), and it is sweet enough, especially with vanilla ice creme.  Once cooled, it does form a purple gelatanous base, but this could be scraped off to lessen calories even further. \r\n\r\nWe are swimming in blackberries and this recipe is one delicious, easy, and impressive way to use them.  Any berry, fruit or rhubarb could be used.",

The breading part had a nice and tasty consistency but 2 cups of fresh blackberries did not make this dessert fruity enough for me.

The recipe is quite simple and I will use it again but next time I will at least double the fruit portion.",
