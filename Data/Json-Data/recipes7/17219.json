Although I liked the flavor of these rolls, the one thing that just didn\u2019t satisfy me was the texture.  The turned out somewhat dry and chewy, not soft like an ideal cinnamon roll should be.  One criticism I have is that the recipe doesn\u2019t give you any indication on what size the dough rectangle should be (such as 16\u201d x 21\u201d), and that\u2019s important.  Also, I chopped up 2 cups of pecans which turned out to be too much on top of the sugar mixture. I stopped at 1 cup, probably because my dough rectangle should have been larger.  This recipe has no icing, so I took the photo accordingly.  My husband asked \u201cwhere\u2019s the icing,\u201d so I did go back and made a quick glaze, and gave each roll a drizzle.  These were OK, not my favorite on this site, and honestly,  doubtful I\u2019ll make again.",

They didn't rise as much as I was hoping which may be because of the yeast being mixed with the dry goods instead of on its own with water to activate. Still turned out better than the store bought ones we had a couple of weeks ago and may still give this a shot with tweaks like adding the yeast to water first and cutting the milk in half to make up for the extra liquid. Also waited on preheating the oven since I didn't want it sitting on for 60 min.",
