Secondly you need to add \"white pepper\" which is why they are called \"pepper nuts\". This recipe should use about one quarter of a teaspoon. \n\nIt also requires 2 teaspoons of baking soda which will make them rise a bit to get the perfect traditional pebern\u00f8dder shape!\n\nAlso the correct way to write it without the special character is \"Pebernoedder\".

They're almost like gravel round and hard. But the cardamom flavor can't be beat. When we make them we roll them into ropes about 3/8\" in diameter. Cut the rope then roll the rope a quarter turn cut and roll back a quarter turn. Then the peppernut has a strange 3-D trapezoidal shape. Set them in rows on the cookie sheet (they don't spread so you can put them quite close together). These are a tradition for us to make the day after Thanksgiving. I cannot wait!",

These cookies are FANTASTIC!! A German neighbor made these when I was a kid and helping her was always a blast. This is definitely a \"get together\" recipe because the cookies are made so small it does take a while to roll them all out - but they are so worth it!!! We fill up pretty jars with them and decorate them with ribbons for gifts. They are tasty like a crunchy bite-sized gingersnap - I can't tell you how happy I am to have this recipe. My son loves helpig with them and it will definitely become a Christmas tradition in our home to make these! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",
