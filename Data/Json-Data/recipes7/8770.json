                "reviewBody": "It isn't even close to Valentine's Day but when I noticed this recipe I recognized it as quite possibly a hidden gem of a yellow cake.  While I didn't use the designated pans, it did \"pan out.\"  (Ha! Couldn't resist!)  I did have my concerns - first, this calls for a little more milk than other, similar, recipes.  Then, when I mixed it up, the batter looked just a teensy bit curdly, not as silky and fluffy as I would have liked.  (or as the batter I used yesterday  in \"Aunt Mary's  Delicious Bunny Cake\" was) I made half a recipe into 12 cupcakes.  I gazed at them a couple of times during the baking process (about 20 minutes) and they rose up nicely.  The frosting, as I've mentioned many times in my reviews, has that 2 c. powdered sugar to 1/2 c. butter or shortening that I prize.  In this instance, however,  a little milk or water is needed.  The cake is moist  (since butter cakes can be dry I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil to this half recipe - 2 T. if using the full recipe), a pretty yellow, soft, but not so soft it's fragile, not fluffy  but not dense either - just what you'd want for the perfect old-fashioned  yellow layer cake or cupcake. The bottom line is that as this recipe's first reviewer I give it two thumbs up.  I'm sure it would make a darned fine Valentines's Day Cake, but it made some darned good cupcakes too!.",
