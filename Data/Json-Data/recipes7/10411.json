I think a 9x5 pan is entirely too big for this recipe. It would do better in a smaller loaf pan or possibly mini loaves. Because of the minimal amount of leavening it raised very little and therefore was a thin pound cake loaf. I tasted this while still warm and really only got a sweet citrus flavor no rosemary. I did use fresh rosemary. Uncertain whether I would make this again.",
