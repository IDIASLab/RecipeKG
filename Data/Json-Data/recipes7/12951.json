Everything is accurate, except that when we serve this we serve it with an over easy egg rather than scrambled.  The yolk from the egg is absolutely amazing as it soaks in to the rice and meat.

This was so full of flavor and so darn easy to make I simply couldn't believe it.  I did use low-sodium soy sauce, but there still may be some folks who think it's too salty (not us!).  Next time, I'll probably add a little grated carrot to the rice to give it a pop of color, but we really enjoyed this.  Garnished with some chopped peanuts and would add them again!",
