I never made meatballs with oats but they came out really good - flavor and consistency. I did bake them in the oven for 20 mins at 400 instead of frying them as that's how I make my meatballs. The sauce was really bland. I did not add the fennel but otherwise made as written. I do not like fennel so doubt I would try again but this will be my go-to meatball recipe (I made some with and without cheese and both options were yummy...I may even liked the plain ones better).",
