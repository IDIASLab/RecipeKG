After tasting this, you'll have a difficult time justifying a store bought ice cream purchase. You can leave out the peanut butter and have heavenly double chocolate ice cream, yum! If you like your ice cream on the sweeter side, you can add an additional 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of sugar. Personally, I think the ice cream is sweet enough with 1/2 cup.",

Just threw them into the hot liquid and whisked until they had melted.  We didn't wait long after it was done in the ice cream maker to eat it. The rest was put into the freezer. Stayed creamy and scoopable. When I've made ice cream in the past it always turned into a brick. Definitely will be making this again",
