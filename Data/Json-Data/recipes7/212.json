It was good just when you blend the cooked rice and combine everything else its kind of clumpy. So the second time- this morning- I ground the rice before cooking it, then for about 1 cup of rice I used about 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of water. The rice absorbs the liquid easily so you can not hardly put too much liquids in it. I also sweetened it with honey and Iraqi date syrup. Very smooth and creamy and tasty now! Very good basic recipe.

Because of this I didn't put the cooked rice in the food processor since there was so much of it. I used stevia instead of sugar and added some chia seeds. I was so pleased with how creamy it was and the amount of sweetness was perfect. I may add some cinnamon next time and see how that tastes. All in all this is a great recipe that allowed me to use up some bulk rice and dates.",
