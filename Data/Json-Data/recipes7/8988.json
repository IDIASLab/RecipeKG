I ended up using 2 cups of cooked squash that was freshly picked from the garden. As with the previous reviewer my baking time was substantially more than mentioned in the recipe. This could be because I used a larger squash or my squash had more moisture because it was freshly picked. In any case the muffins were moist and had good flavor. I wouldn t add a pecan half on the top next time but perhaps just add some chopped pecans.",
