I found the Tofutti flavor (dairy-free cream cheese) was lost among the blueberry-lemon flavors but they were still tasty. Against my better judgement I went ahead and used white sugar in the glaze. And just as i thought the glaze was grainy. Next time I will use powdered sugar. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
