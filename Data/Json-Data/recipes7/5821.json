I used sweet cherries reduced the sugar about 1/4 cup and used my Cuisinart Ice Cream maker to process the fruit mixture. The finished texture was classic sorbet it firmed up perfectly. If I use sweet cherries again I'll try 1/2 cup of sugar because it was still pretty sweet but that's just a personal taste preference. I'm sure sour cherries would have made this even better but this was still pretty darn good. Thanks CJ.",

I drained and gently pressed the cherries to remove canned liquid and find any missed pits. Used 1/2 cup sugar (we like tart) 2/3 cup Knudsen Just Tart Cherry Juice (to replace missing juice from missing fresh cherries) 1/2 t almond extract and instead of the wine and salt I used probably 1/3 cup vodka (out of white wine). Mixed in the blender and then chilled and froze in Kitchen Aid ice cream bowl then into the freezer to ripen overnight. The texture is perfect. We like to top with chopped Amarena cherries.",
