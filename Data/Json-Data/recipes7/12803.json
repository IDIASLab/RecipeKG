I say that about everything I use it in. I did use some sesame chili oil for half the oil. I also turned off the oven after an hour and left it in there until cooled and used the broiler pan filled with water. I've done that with all seitans Really tasty all the pepperoni taste without the ickiness of meat. In response to Patricia--not having flour and falling apart- vital wheat gluten is basically flour with the starch washed out so it's low carb and all gluten. As you knead it it does get stringy and stretchy and tears. You don't have to worry about how it looks when you press it into a log in the foil it will swell with cooking and conform to the foil. You get used to how it is after doing it!",

Based on reviews from my seitan group i doubled the seasonings except for the cayenne which I only increased by 50% and I did not change the amount of anise.

It is AMAZING and better than any vegan pepperoni I have bought in stores.",

When I went to buy liquid smoke there were two to choose from - I made this with hickory I'll try the Mesquite sometime too. This was so easy to make and has a fabulous taste! I'm having a hard time not eating it all at once. Definitely something I'll make again (went and bought more of the flour and yeast today in fact...)
