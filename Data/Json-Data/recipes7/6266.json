It is just creamy goodness.  I tried a similar recipe years ago that I loved but alas lost.  I thought this was it but I was mistaken.  However I think the difference may be adding twice as much cream cheese.  I will try that next time to see if I can capture the cheesecake taste.",

After accidentally burning my homemade jam when I walked away for a minute, my husband picked some up at the store. He returned with a seedless variety. This may have added to extra sliding between the layers. I think this would work well if made in a springform pan if making your own crust.  Finally, before serving I topped it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.",
