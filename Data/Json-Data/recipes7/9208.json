Texture was more cake-like rather than traditional bread-like, but plenty moist and tasty.  Only one criticism...it was very crumbly and difficult to slice; we ended up eating it with a fork.  Both the peanut butter and the banana flavors come through, with not one dominating the other.*****UPDATE 4.23.13******The slicing issue may have been a result of the bread not cooled \"completely\" because it sliced just fine this morning (guess we were a little too eager to test it out).",

I didn't have buttermilk so I used three tablespoons of yogurt and one tablespoon of milk and mixed it together. I used butter instead of shortening. I also used two normal sized bananas to keep them moist and one teaspoon of vanilla. They filled the muffin hole to the top so I cooked them for 24 minutes at 350. The second time I made these I used applesauce instead of butter added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg and cooked them for 20 minutes at 350. They were perfect!",

I am picky about my banana breads too had to try this one because of the peanut butter so glad I did!! went with 1/2 Whole wheat & 1/2 White flour used butter instead of shortening a little bit more banana and a hair less sugar than called for. Excellent! Don't know why another reviewer said she couldn't taste the banana or the peanut better very strongly I found both the flavors very robust & well balanced in this recipe! Everyone I shared it will loved it I have 2 more loaves in the oven now!",

                "reviewBody": "Very nice. Family LOVED these as muffins topped w Peanut Butter and Banana Frosting from this site. I used egg white substitute for the eggs (no one ever notices so if you're watching calories in baking it's a great sub) and used sour milk instead of buttermilk and otherwise left everything the same. I filled the muffin tins about 3/4 full and still got 16 rounded muffins out of this recipe. The muffins were done at about 25 minutes. They didn't brown much as muffins though so if I hadn't topped with frosting I'd suggest a topping of peanuts or something before going in the oven for visual appeal. As another reviewer commented this results in a pretty smooth result so if you like some fruit or nuts added into your bread/muffins I'd suggest using chunky peanut butter and/or adding in some dried fruit. Really though if you love banana bread and you love peanut butter you will more than likely enjoy this recipe. Both are noticeable in this. Thanks for the recipe!",

I swapped out the shortening with softened butter and use sour cream instead of butter milk since I didn t have either on hand. Kids loved these. I had a little batter left after making 3 dozen mini muffins so added a handful of chocolate chips just to see how the flavor would come out. Loved them!! Glad I saved these just for me!
