        "description": "I have cooked this recipe a hundred of times and it is a real hit with kids and adults alike. Traditionally I have always used a camp oven, which is a cast-iron pot with a lid. You can even cook this at home in your conventional oven. The ingredients are very traditional and generally found in everyone's pantry. These have been proven to last much longer in very hot conditions and even in the humid tropics. Dampers are traditionally served with a cup of black tea, however just use a drink of your own choice. Serve with butter and golden syrup, treacle, refined molasses, or jam.",
