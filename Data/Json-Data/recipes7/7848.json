I did use only brown sugar as it makes it more 'caramel-y' and I mixed that cinnamon in with the peach slice itself instead of on top of the crust. Next time I am going to try using a puff pastry... wonder if that would work as well?! I would add a photo but the crust formation was hilarious!",

If you do try this recipe be careful applying the cinnamon and sugar. It is not really \"sprinkling\" because it all bounced right off had to be a little more diligent getting it to stay on. The peaches tasted fine when we were slicing them (taste testing wink wink) but once you tasted them in the pie it had no flavor. The recipe is just too plain. Sorry guys this one was a no go.",
