Secure lids with bands, process for 5 minutes in a boiling water bath. Allow jars to cool slowly, creating a vacuum seal. Allow to sit at room temperature 1 to 2 days to allow jam to set. Refrigerate after opening.\n"

This is fine if you are extending a recipe - but I was hoping for one where you could taste all the flavors. I added more cherries 1 TBSP fresh ginger (thinking Asian as suggested by the Mandarin) and some orange zest. I never would have thought of the pairings on my own so think Chef RachtheBach is talented.",
