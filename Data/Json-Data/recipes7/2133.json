Their recipe is a little different and they separate the egg yolk and white, and mix the yolk in with the sugar, then milk, then flour and beat the egg whites until they are stiff and fold them in to the batter along with the raisins. This makes the pancakes very light and fluffy.\nThey serve the \"German Pancakes\" with icing sugar and lemon juice. Delicious!",
