I used a packet (the microwave stuff) of cinnamon and spice oatmeal- initially, I was going to use plain oatmeal, but I felt I needed the cinnamon somehow. Anyway, it came out great! I made it again, but didn\u2019t feel like going back out to get cinnamon, so I threw some honey packets in the apple mix to give it a little something something- that was better. It did require more microwave time, which may have had something to do with the oats I used; it could also have had something to do with the fact that I was eyeballing my measurements due to not having proper measuring spoons in my hotel room. I gave it 4 stars because it tastes like it needs a little squeeze of lemon and some vanilla extract. It does make sense that if you\u2019re making it in mugs you probably don\u2019t want to do all that, but idk tastes like it\u2019s missing something other than cinnamon. I do like it and I would make it again - maybe I just need to drop a scoop of ice cream on it next time :)",
