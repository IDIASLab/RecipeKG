Truth be told, I was surprised; I was not expecting that great a review of these bars from Hubs at all.  They looked a little dry to me.  In fact, I thought maybe I had over baked them.  Earlier, as I was putting these bars together, I was a little disappointed; the blueberry filling looked skimpy to me.  Throwing caution to the wind, I tossed in another handful of berries, filling up the \u201cblank\u201d spaces, so I knew I had to be sure to bake them long enough.  I hoped for the best.  Well, it obviously was okay.  But I still had to see for myself.  Hubs, neat freak that he is, used a fork.  I did not, and the bar held together nicely.  Also, I\u2019m glad I threw in that extra handful of blueberries, but I would have liked a little extra juiciness, so if I make these again, I\u2019ll have to remember to increase all filling ingredients \u201cby a handful.\u201d (For a half recipe in an 8x8\" pan) These are fresh tasting, flavorful and buttery and, interestingly, the next day the topping is still as it came out of the oven, not soggy as I had expected.",
