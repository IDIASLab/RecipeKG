The flavor of the sweet strawberries combined with the flavor of the peppers gives this jam a wonderful flavor dimension. The strawberries may be frozen (thawed and crushed) and the peppers may be canned (drained and chopped).",

Word of advice **Use disposable latex gloves when handling peppers** I learned the hard way. I removed the veins and half of the seeds from the peppers. The jam was mild. I plan on making a \"spicier\" batch and will use a habanero pepper along with the jalapenos. Thank you for the recipe! Amanda Mobile, AL",

I made a quick fruit dip stirring this in with cream cheese and a couple of tablespoons of cream. Thanks for sharing this recipe",

I made it hot as written by using one seeded anaheim pepper and 3 seeded jalapenos and 3 with the seeds. (They all still totalled one cup when finely chopped). If you like it mild, remove all the seeds and just use jalapenos. Great recipe if all you have is frozen berries, use the unsweetened ones and make sure you measure the four cups AFTER you mash them. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!",

Recipe calls for a 2-oz pkg of powdered fruit pectin, but I now see that Sure-Jell reduced the size to 1.75 oz, just like so many other companies are doing.  They try not to increase price much, but they just reduce the size which can totally screw up recipes.  The flavor on this jam is great.  So your options are to use the 1.75 oz pkg and try to adjust the quantity of the other ingredients or open another pkg (at cost of $1.70) for the additional 1/4 oz and probably just pitch the rest of the opened pkg.  3.31.11 update:  this firmed up overnight, so I'm upgrading the review to 5 stars...it's now perfect!",
