I don't necessarily want that on a blueberry muffin as I would a spice cake or coffee cake topping.  The \"OR TO TASTE\" means you can add more if you like or skip it altogether.  You can use powdered vanilla extract as well.  That's really good on a chocolate muffin! You can add more cinnamon for a streusel in a coffee cake. This is a recipe to make a large quantity so you have the ease of switching it up from recipe to recipe.  It saves time having it on hand and can customize to your recipes.",

A couple of hours in the refrigerator for the butter to harden again let me use a pastry cutter to make it into proper crumbs. It's in the freezer now ready and waiting.",

I scaled this way back and used on a store bought coffee cake. The topping was better than the cake! I just made your personal recipe 'Jan's Maple Coffee Cake' and realized the topping is very similar minus the white sugar so I know it will be a hit. I like the idea that you can make up a big batch of this and keep it handy in the freezer. Thanks for sharing!",
