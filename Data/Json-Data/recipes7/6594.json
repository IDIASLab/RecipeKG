I have combed the internet and have tried 6 so far then I tried this recipe. This by far is THE BEST!. As a matter of fact this recipe even topped the original salad we loved so much. I do recommend however since I made this twice in a 24 hour period LOL that you do not drain the bacon grease. It is not that much grease and the flavor goes throughout the entire salad. What an awesome salad! Thanks Dina for sharing this!",

This isn't too bad but neither hubs nor I are sure about it. It's maybe just not too our tastes. I think it's a bit too sweet and I'm not so certain about the mayo mix at the bottom of the bowl. Hubs doesn't really like raw broccoli--something I forgot so he might like this with cooked broccoli as that was his only complaint. I'm not sure I will but I'm glad I gave it a shot--it's always worth trying something new even if it's not quite to our tastes. I don't have raisins so used craisins and we aren't a fan of raw onions so I subbed a bell pepper. All in all it's not a bad salad it's just not quite our thing. Thanks for the recipe!",
