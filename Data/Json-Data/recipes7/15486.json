Cubes of this pound cake layered with homemade whipped cream and berries. Built the dessert in a clear plastic trifle dish and it was gorgeous! Traditionally pound cake uses a pound of butter a pound of sugar and a pound of flour...the measurements for these ingredients were off that ratio for this recipe but I still liked it very much! Thanks for sharing your family recipe!",

THIS THE BEST POUND CAKE I'VE EVER MADE!!!\nEven the dogs are hoping Ill drop some crumbs or even a whole piece...Its not begging it being optimistic and helpful. I only changed one thing and that is I like almond extract instead of vanilla. As I said I have been looking for a Good pound cake recipe\u00a0and this is it. I know that I can add or change things up as I like because the base for it is perfect. So i would recommend this cake to anyone. \n\nYes In less than a week I  made this  extraordinary cake again. This time I tweaked it to my tastes and replace 1 c of flour with coconut flour and used half and half instead of milk . I also added an additional egg yolk. This really is a blue ribbon winner recipe and it will be adopted as a nowden family recipe",
