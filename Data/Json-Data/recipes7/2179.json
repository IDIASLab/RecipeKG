I left out the nuts and cranberries and only used 2/3 cup Sugar. Also I used Cinnamon Plus (a cinnamon spice blend for pampered chef that has nutmeg, allspice, orange peel, cloves, & ginger) instead of just cinnamon. I cooked it in a muffin pan (making 24 muffins) instead of loaf pans. It takes less time to cook so keep an eye on the muffins. I think it was about 25-30 minutes.",

I substituted apple sauce for the oil to make it healthier.  It was somewhat dry, and this may have caused that, even though I have subbed apple sauce before to other recipes without any problems.  I also reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup.  It was a good amount of sugar.  1 cup would have been way too much.  I also switched out pecans for walnuts.  Also, it only needed to bake 35-40 minutes.  I took it out after 40, but since it was a bit dry, maybe it could have come out even sooner. Overall, it was very good, just a little dry. Will probably play around with it & try it again.",
