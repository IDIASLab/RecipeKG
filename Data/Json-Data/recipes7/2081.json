I didn't have cream so I used straight milk and since I didn't have tomato juice was making it out of tomato paste (3/4 c paste 1 cup water to make tomato sauce then equal parts sauce/water to make juice) so I added in an extra teaspoon or two of paste as a thickener. It was excellent. I pureed the whole thing and my kids husband and myself dipped grilled cheese sandwiches into it. Definitely something I'm going to make again and again.",
