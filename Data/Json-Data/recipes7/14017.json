It's sweet, salty, spicy, and very tender (Thanks to the Coke&reg;). I use this same recipe to make Bulgogi and Dae Ji Bool Gogi (Spicy Pork) and simply change the onions to sliced bulbs for the bulgogi.",

My only complaint was that I wish the ribs had more of the marinade flavor! Maybe using the thinner cut will prove to be more flavorful. I will definitely be teying this again when I find some. Great share!",
