She pulls the paper from the butter, peels the bananas, mashes and mixes. It's so fast and easy. Any time we have a couple bananas going brown we mix up these. The recipe originated as my grandmother's banana bread, but one day I was in a rush and didn't want to wait an hour for the bread to bake so I tossed them in as cookies and we all agreed it came out better this way.",

When taken out of the oven, I left them on the cookie sheet for an additional 10 minutes before removing to a rack for cooling.\n\nThese were incredibly moist, soft and fluffy.  I will definitely be making these again (possibly in lieu of an actual banana bread!)",
