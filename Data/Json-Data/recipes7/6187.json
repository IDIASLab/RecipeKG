I mixed the extract and condensed milk together then added 2-3 tablespoons of the mixture 2 teaspoons of milk and 2-3 cups of snow at a time mixing well as I went. It had a good consistency but it wasn't sweet enough according to my 8 and 5 year old and my husband. So I added 5 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons powdered sugar. It was really good then. I agree with them it had a good vanilla taste but it just wasn't sweet enough. The next time I make this I'm going to use more condensed milk. My husband just said he'd give it 4 stars too.",
