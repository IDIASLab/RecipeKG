My Dad is famous for his marg recipe and it is GOOD so technically I will have to give this a 4.9 lest I be disowned by my DD. But what I love about this is the fresh taste. No mixer just fresh fruit and sugar. Tip: if you don't want to spend forever shaking to dissolve the sugar make some simple syrup (just water and sugar...recipe on this site) in advance and chill it. Then add the fruit then the tequila. This will water it down just slightly but trust me this is a VERY strong drink and a tiny bit of water won't change that! Thanks BlondeJJ and by the way I had almost as much fun photographing this as I did drinking it!",
