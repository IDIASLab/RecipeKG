        "description": "This is a spicy sauce similar to etouffee. By adding seafood, it becomes Seafood Creole. Due to the seasoning mix, it is quite spicy. This can be controlled by adjusting the amount of the peppers. I like mine full strength, but for the wife I have to cut the peppers down to 1/8 teaspoon each. This recipe can easily be doubled or quadrupled for large affairs. It goes great with rice, garlic bread, a green salad and a good white wine, such as white Merlot, white Cabernet, Johannisburg Riesling, or Gewurztraminer. Use your favorite firm, white fish fillets in this recipe. Canned diced tomatoes can be used in place of chopping fresh tomatoes.",

I made it for Valentine's supper tonight and it went over fabulously well with my significant other. :-)  I made the recipe exactly as written like I aways do the first time and even though we both enjoyed this creole, I would do a couple of things different in the future.  Firstly, the amount of hot pepper sauce was just a little bit too much heat for me...so would go down to a quarter teaspoon and put the tabasco bottle of the table for others who may need more.  Then I would add at least another times as much peeled and chopped tomato, as I didn't really think there was enough.  And finally, the sauce would have been better thickened up at the end with a bit of cornstarch and water.  But honestly...it really was great just the way it turned out tonight even all of that said.  I recommend trying it!!",

Just cook the sauce down a little more to thicken and concentrate the flavors! Served with jalape\u00f1o cheese cornbread and green salad. Yum!",
