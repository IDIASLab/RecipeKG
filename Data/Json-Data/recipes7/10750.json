I also substituted the oil with applesauce! They came out great and all 3 of my kids loved them! The recipe made 20 pancakes; you can halve it if you do not need that many. I freeze the extras for another day!",

These were really great and the texture was a pleasant change to regular or even oatmeal pancakes. We used coconut oil in place of applesauce because we didn't have applesauce on hand. This changed the healthiness of them for sure but still made for a good texture and added a hint of coconut flavor. We also didn't have almonds so substituted walnuts. I'd recommend toasting before adding to batter; we did not do that. We also added some chocolate chips which also makes these less healthy but pancakes by nature aren't exactly health food.:)",

I will double the amount of almond extract next time because I enjoy the decadence of Amaretto. I also used blueberries which I always enjoy. Pancakes can be full of unwanted ingredients that aren't healthy or to a pancake that misses the essence of what a pancake should be. In my opinion this recipe has a high health quotient while being very tasty!!!",
