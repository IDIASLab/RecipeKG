Wow, the flavors just popped! Used a variety of whole grain pastas, bow ties, fusilli and mini penne, delightful and healthy!",

I followed the recipe exactly and tasted the sauce. I agree with other reviewers that it needed a little kick so I added a clove of finely minced garlic and a pinch of dried ginger. (Too lazy to drag the real stuff out of the freezer and grate it.) The addition of those two flavors took this recipe over the top. I added the chopped red pepper and I also blanched the snow peas for one minute. The taste explosion just pops in your mouth. This recipe goes into the summer salad lineup. As others have mentioned the addition of chicken or shrimp would make this a meal in itself. Thank you CookingWGreen for this tasty recipe.",

I did blanch the sugar snap peas for about 1 minute in boiling water to bring out the green color of the peas.  I used a box of cut spaghetti rather than regular spaghetti.  We wanted a different salad for packed lunches and this fit the bill, nicely. The salad held up nicely for 4 days.  My son warmed his up rather than eating it cold and he liked it better that way.  This could easily be a main dish by adding cooked chicken or pork to the other ingredients.  Great dish with lots of flavor.",

I added one whole seedless cucumber, about 2 cups of kale, about 1/2 cup cilantro, and 1 tablespoon of miso paste.  I boiled the pasta and when there was 1 minute left to cook I added in the snow peas and the kale.  We also mixed everything up and ate it right away as we were making it for a weeknight dinner.  There was plenty of sauce even with the added vegetables.  It made 10 cups and with all those additional veggies each cup was only worth 3 Weight Watchers points!  It would be good with toasted peanuts if you're looking to add some protein.  Next time I'll try making it with soba noodles.  This will definitely go in our weekly rotation this summer.
