Other variations are strucla z migdalowa (almonds) makowiec or makownik or strucla z makiem (with poppy seeds). This was a hit at my Christmas party this year!

You can use any pie filling available in a can. I've used Triple Berry Apple and several others. I prefer poppy seed filling but due to drug tests I stay away from that for people. Also bakers make sure you check the date of the yeast you are baking with. If it's expired it won't rise. Also it's usually better to \"proof\" the yeast before adding it to a recipe which will \"prove\" that it's a good yeast batch.",

Another way is that my Grandma would mix powdered sugar with the ground walnuts. My mother changed that part and mixes maple syrup in with the ground walnuts. I sometimes do both or just use maple syrup and we do not roll the dough out so thin and don't have as many rolls. The upside to that is that I have never had any problems with the rolling of the dough and so forth. We only make it for Christmas and Pascha (Easter).

I believe the main problem was the dough--mine did not rise AT ALL after sitting for over 2.5 hours! The filling came out to be too watery and I had to drain access liquid before I used it. So I ended up with 3 tiny loaves that didn't rise in size even when baked and they had waaaaay too many nuts inside (because of the proportion). Very very dissappointing!!! By the way it took a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare it--it was well over an hour not counting the clean-up.",
