I cut this recipe in half, and in an effort to lighten it a bit, I did use lite peaches, skim milk, Truvia\u00ae for baking, and ICBINB spread.  I'm not convinced you need this much butter, and if I make this again, I'll try it with half the amount in the recipe.   Added a good shake of of cinnamon and a sprinkle of turbinado sugar before going into the oven.  This tastes very similar to something my mother made when I was child.  Maybe not rocket science, but we enjoyed it.",

I think it comes out about the same either way. Dump out about half the syrup. You can also use fresh peaches about 4 cups sliced with about a tablespoon l lemon juice and about 1/4 cup sugar. The crust is soft like pudding cake. Not like a pie crust topping that a lot of people use.",
