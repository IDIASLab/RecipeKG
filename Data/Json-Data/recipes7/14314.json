I heated the oil to a medium high heat so the beans would blacken a little bit. Once they were cooked (but still crunchy) I added the garlic (which became brown and crunchy) and immediately put in the sauce. I let it cook for less than a minute and put them in a sport dish. For the sauce, I didn't have ginger so I used ginger powder, I omitted the sesame oil since I fried them in coconut oil and used agave nectar in place of sugar. This will be a regular side dish/snack at our house!",
