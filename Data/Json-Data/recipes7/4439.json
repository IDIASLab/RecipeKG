Got a little tired but oh my it was worth it. Candy's so smooth and melts in your mouth. Sweetness is just right. I used walnuts (cheaper than pecans) and it was great. Make sure and use a big pot as milk seems to double in size until it boils down to a rich caramel color. I will be making this again!",
