                "reviewBody": "I'm curious about a couple of things about this recipe.  First, why did I end up with 24, not 12, of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates?  Could it be an AR misprint?  Mine is a standard, mini-muffin tin.  Second, I really don't like nutmeg much. So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?! And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth?  Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're  small you won't eat as much.  You'll just eat more of them.  And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS, Dianne! That way you get more of that buttery, cinnamony sweetness in every bite!  I did make a couple of modifications, but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine and, because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use, I subbed buttermilk for the milk. This worked beautifully, but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1/2 tsp. baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly! Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up!  (And I already did, with five of them) Your recipe is a beauty, Dianne! ~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around  to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies, sometimes significantly! This explains the variance in yield with this recipe, to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins.",

Second, I finally found out from my mom, who got the recipe from my grandma, that this recipe makes 24 mini muffins.  You fill the muffins cups 1/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin.  You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish, but \"officially\" this recipe makes 24.  I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side.

Simple, delicious, sweet little treats that are kinda like a potato chip - I dare you to eat just one.....  With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long. I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out. I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe. Thanks Dianne! Update: Like others, I did get a little more than twelve out of one batch but I was so busy popping these little goodies in my mouth I didn't notice the discrepancy. And at any rate, you just can't get enough of these!",

I also coated mine in powdered sugar, vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze. We all like the vanilla glaze best! Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze\n\n2 cups confectioners' sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 TBS milk\n1 TBS butter, softened\nPut that into a bowl and mix together. I added more milk, but I didn't measure. I just got it to the consistancy I liked. Once I mixed it, I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed. Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry. I double dipped them. Then on the vanilla glaze ones, I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze. Also, glaze them once they have cooled.

I had been craving donuts and this satisfied my sweet tooth perfectly - and presumably at least a little healthier since they're baked (not fried like actual donuts). I made the muffin recipe exactly as listed (I did sub butter instead of margarine), but baked them in regular size muffin tin using cupcake liners. The recipe as listed gave me 8 \"regular\" muffins. Then, instead of rolling them in the butter & cinnamon-sugar mixture I simply drizzled melted butter on the tops of the muffins & sprinkled the cinnamon sugar over the butter while they were still warm & fresh out of the oven. They were fantastic - great taste and texture - I'll definitely make these again! P.S. Since I made these in a regular size muffin tin I baked them for about 21 mins.",
