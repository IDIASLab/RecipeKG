Cut sugar to 1 1/2 c. and used 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 regular sugar.  I substituted the butter with coconut oil. Be careful when softening because it won't take as long as butter. I substituted the all-purpose flour with coconut flour. This ratio is 1:4. For every cup of regular flour use 1/4 c coconut flour. I also added a 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.  Put this in a 9x13 pan, sprinkled with additional coconut and baked for the same 45 min. It turned out wonderful! So, I guess you could say I made a Coconut Coconut Coconut Coconut Milk Cake!",

I would not change anything. The event I used it for had children teens and adults and they all love it! Highly recommend it. One thing; baking in the large pan took longer than the 45 minutes. For the frosting I used a recipe that calls for 1-14oz can of condensed milk 1/3 cup chocolate powder sifted 1/3 cup whole milk 1 tbsp. unsalted butter softened pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. Mix all the ingredients except the vanilla in a saucepan. Cook stirring constantly over medium-moderate heat until thickened. Remove from heat then mix in the vanilla extract. Let cool a bit then frost cooled cake. The actual frosting recipe did not call for the pinch of salt or vanilla but it needed something and those two balanced out the taste. I hope you all enjoy!",
