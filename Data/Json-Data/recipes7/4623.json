        "description": "Ostrich and venison are the two meats with the lowest fat contents. Try this for a simple change. Gentle cooking is best (cooking too fast will turn the steaks leathery), and we aim for rare or medium. I like mine rare, and turn when the outside begins (just) to caramelise. A definite hit with my guests every time I do it. If you can get Creme Fraiche then fine, but try to avoid any CF that is labeled 'light'. This curdles when heated. You can thicken the sauce if you like by using less stock. Serve with rice or potatoes and some tasty vegetables.",

So when cooking the steaks it would not be possible to get a golden brown on each side and to get rid of all the pink! Cook the steaks more gently rather than sear them and treat them as you would treat Venison.",

The project failed miserably and never became mainstream I think because the birds were so large unusual and regal but a few restaurants still prepare it. Very meaty and lean it is delicious when prepared properly. I'm a fan although it is no longer sold retail here. California Cafe in Denver still features it and it expensive but incredible and worth it! (30.00 a steak)",
