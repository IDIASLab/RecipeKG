For starters this makes way too much batter and half and half is not cheap so I recommend cutting back on that. While the cheese and bread cut just fine crumbled bacon does not stay inside the sandwich. I recommend cutting your bread first and then assembling the sandwiches. On that note you really need to tear your slices of cheese into smaller strips so that they fit nicely on your 2 inch round bread. One thing that was confusing about this recipe is that you end up with 2 extra bread rings that don't go into the recipe. I'm putting that out there so that you won't be scratching your head trying to figure it out while you sammich is burning like I did. You will end up with 2 extra bread rings. Overall I really liked the concept of this it was fun and it tasted good.",

Lay down slices of bacon in between the 2 cheeses to secure it. Secondly this is a personal preference but i thought 2 slices of cheese was too much so I stuck with just one (whichever kind you like best). I also added 1/2 tea vanilla to egg batter. Next do NOT crack the egg in immediately as said in recipe unless you want egg cooked completely through/not over easy. Toast one side of the sandwich in the pan first flip THEN add the egg. When that side is toasted flip again just for 30 sec to cook the egg whites on top layer and serve with a side of maple syrup to dip in. MUCH better.",
