I made a slight change to the recipe - I used only 1/4 c of sugar instead of  1/3 c and that was plenty sweet for my tastes.   I also found it easier to cut the peppers in quarters instead of halves.  The liquid level was a little low once poured into the jar. The peppers weren't completely covered, but that was fine because I just ate a couple peppers the next day and that solved the problem. :)  I later served these on a meat and cheese tray. Thanks for the great recipe Love2C0ok!",

I only used half the sugar and may cut it down even more the next time as even at half I thought they were a bit too sweet. I also added two hot peppers but that had very little effect. We did like the outcome and I'll keep some on hand in the fridge for snacks and quick lunches. Thank you Love2c0ok for the recipe.",
