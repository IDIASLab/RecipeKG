I was surprised at the list of spices as I chuckled to myself because I really just thought seasoning salt was salt before I googled it:) Glad I made this my recipe came out great a tad bit to salty but that can easily be adjusted. I did cut the sugar in half as I\u2019m trying to watch. Typically I make all of my own seasoning from scratch due to food allergies and this will now be on my list. Thank you for the recipe!",
