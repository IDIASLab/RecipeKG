                "reviewBody": "This recipe is great as written! Like another user mentioned. Uses butter and lots of pumpkin. (Almost double the amount most recipes call for) I made some changes to make it healthier and suit my own tastes. I used 2 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour 1 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp nutmeg 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 cup melted butter 1/2 cup low fat buttermilk 1/2 cup BROWN sugar 5 packets of Splenda 2 tbs flax 1/2 cup water pureed till smooth (substitutes the eggs) 2 cups of pumpkin 1 TBS vanilla and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. I decided to use melted butter to blend in the brown sugar better. The full cup of butter is really not necessary but definitely needed for the wonderful flavor of butter. The buttermilk that substituted for the other 1/2 cup of butter provided the rich flavor that apple sauce/ yogurt won't provide. I didn't use the walnuts but I'm sure they would be delicious. Perhaps even better with toasted pecans. Drop them by rounded tbs on the cookie sheet and flattened them out slightly because they don't spread much. I baked mine at 375 degrees for 19 minutes. They may look done earlier but they are not! The large amount of pumpkin takes a while to cook through. After baking the result is a crisp outside and soft inside cake-like cookie. Amazing rich buttery pumpkin flavor cookie. My house smelled just like Thanksgiving time when I was baking. Definitely try it this way. Hopefully my review helped. =D",
