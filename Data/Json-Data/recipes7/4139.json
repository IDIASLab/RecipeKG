I am so happy to have found this recipe! The mayo found here in Germany is not like the real stuff back home. This is the closest I will ever get. I used what I had on hand substituting prepared yellow mustard for the mustard powder (I kept the same quantity) and sunflower oil for the vegetable oil. This recipe was quick and easy to make with outstanding results. I had my parents taste test it with the following verdict: my dad and I really liked it and both agreed that it is just like the stuff you buy at the store but my mom on the other hand thought that it had too much lemon. So I would recommend adjusting the lemon flavour to your own taste. Thanks Jillena for this wonderful recipe.:-)",

In reading the other reviews I was cautious about the lemon juice so I added 1 tsp at a time. I actually liked the 2tsp. I used stevia(trying to cut out sugar) and canola oil. Next time I plan to try olive oil. When I took it out of the blender(mine's not the best of blenders) the mayo was a bit lumpy. I stirred it a bit with a whisk and it turned out nice and smooth. Best of all it tastes great:) Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing! Don't waste your time trying to make with olive oil...it'll turn out bitter...trust me!!",

I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and used Macadamia nut oil. The lime is not as strong as lemon so maybe next time I will use a little bit more....but very happy with the results. I made this in my Kitchen Aid food processor (which I have reviewed on Amazon.com\" - it's a terrible food processor - don't buy it! But I was able to make it work by using a piece of scotch tape over the drip hole - I simple put a tiny hole in the scotch take and it worked beautifully and effortlessly! Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I will never buy mayo from the store again (they're all full of soy anyway - another alergy item).",
