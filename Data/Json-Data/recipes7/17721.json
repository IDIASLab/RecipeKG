I may cut back on the sugar next time just to get a little more of the raspberry flavor, but it really is good as written as well. However, I did have to cook it longer. At 4 minutes, it was just saucy and I started looking at my box of pectin, wondering if I should try to add it. But, I stuck with it, and cooked for about 24 minutes. Being new, I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for, but it may be just a tad too thick now that it's cooled. I would probably do 20 minutes next time. Thank you for this delicious recipe!",
