Maybe I didn't get them ground finely enough but I ended up with hard crunchy bits of the dal in my rice. I did add them in a little earlier to help the mix blend and soften while the tomatoes were cooking but next time I will add the spice/dal mix immediately so any hard pieces can cook down. I did omit some of the chili spices so my kids would eat it but I could have eaten them no problem! I substituted some green pepper instead (from my garden) and this was a nice addition. Wonderful aromatic dish and a delightful dinner.",
