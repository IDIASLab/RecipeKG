I added a couple of scoops of plum sauce in my measuring cup and added the soy sauce over it to equal a cup. By doing this it made the marinade thicker and gave it just the right sweet and savory taste Korean ribs need.  Sorry no exact measuring and I can't remember if I added sugar too.  I also emitted the sesame oil and seeds just out of preference.  Black pepper, garlic, onions are a must and I marinaded it for 5 hours. Will use it over and over and over because to buy this at our local restaurant is way more expensive than doing it yourself! Enjoy :)",

I kept a small pan filled with the extra marinade in the grill as the ribs cooked. This was nice because it started to reduce and made an excellent glaze. I applied the sauce multiple times during the grilling and by the time I finished they were coated perfectly.  I removed the ribs from the grill and wrapped them in foil and allowed them to cool a bit before cutting them apart. I'm pretty sure that I will be using this recipe every time I do ribs. Thanks!",

I had beef ribs that needed to be cooked and I was driven by what is in the pantry since the stores are closed to day for a holiday. I followed the directions as written and added a teaspoon of ground ginger and a few dashes of chinese five spice powder then marinated for about 3 hours. The flavours stay with these even after cooking a delightful sticky sweet/salty delicious-ness. Just be sure to monitor progress regularly on the grill as they can flare up as the fat of the beef rib releases. Mine did suffer a char here and there but still came out very tasty. Will be making again very soon. Thanks Doubledown for sharing. This recipe rocks!",
