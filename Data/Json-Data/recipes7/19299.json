They'd love to roll the dough into balls, into white sugar, then use their thumbs to squish the balls down, and add a few chocolate chips. \nI highly recommend these, especially with the hint of coffee flavor. (Yup, the coffee flavore didn't slow the kids down on the \"eating\" part of the recipe!) \nI had a couple nice photos, but they wouldn't upload.",

Next time I make this I might add walnuts. Bake them no more than 10 minutes long and you will have a slightly crunchy cookie on the outside with a chewy inside. Will definitely make them again. Update: I made this recipe again and decided to add about 1/2 cup of black walnuts bits and pieces....OMG! These are out of this world in deliciousness!!!",
