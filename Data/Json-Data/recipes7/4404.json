Here's what I did: I cut and cored the quince as directed. Then I lined a 13x9 pan with foil and poured in just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan splashed in some Gewurztraminer sprinkled in some cinnamon and sugar and placed the two halves of the quince face down and baked as directed. There wasn't any fluid left to pour over the quince. It was super tasty -- a lot like a baked apple with a very unusual delicious flavor. What I didn't realize at first but soon discovered was that the skin is completely edible. I would definitely have this again!",

My husband turned the timer off a couple times so I'm not sure whether the recipe or user error caused these to take longer than anticipated to bake. My sauce was cooked off (but would have been delicious when I tasted the caramelized residue).",
