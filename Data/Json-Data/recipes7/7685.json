I didn't want to do a water bath after I tasted the hot batch and knew instantly it was going to be a hit with my kids. I can say I never would have thought to use flavored gelation in preserves and being this was only 3 ingredients in a flash to perfection! What made this totally ridiculously sinful was baking off some puff pastry cut into squares opening up the cavity slathering a dollop of Cool Whip's frosting (something I have never used before until this) warm preserves and topped with the 2nd half of the pastry square and eating like it is...OMGosh! talk about heaven. This unusual recipe for me was quite easy tasty and affordable! My whole family loved it! Thanks again. It will be something I do with other flavors of gelatin!",
