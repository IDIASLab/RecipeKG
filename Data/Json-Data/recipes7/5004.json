You may want to use less sugar depending on your taste. This is a great way to use all that zucchini from your garden! My family only likes zucchini bread once in a while, and my kids will only eat a few different veggies -- zucchini being one of them -- so I love discovering new ways to incorporate it into our meals and desserts.",
