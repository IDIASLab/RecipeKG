Indeed, when I mixed up the batter I was sure my suspicions were true.  The batter is very thick, and almost looks oily. I suspect it is the juices from the strawberries that provide the extra moisture the batter seemed to need. It all came together to produce a moist, beautiful bread, full of strawberry flavor, and just the right hint of cinnamon. What did NOT work was the size of the pans called for. When I looked at the batter in the bowl I just knew I would need bigger pans, and as it turned out the 8x4\" pans I used were just right. I prepared this exactly as written and believe it needs no changes or tinkering. And the sprinkle of oatmeal on the top is a great finish! ",

It's only downfall is that it's crumbly where the strawberries are but I can so deal with that bc the taste is wonderful. You can definitely taste the strawberries and the bread is slightly sweet--not too sweet at all. It lets the oatmeal and strawberries shine. I was a bit worried about the batter as it was so thick. The strawberries were a bit difficult to fold in but once I did it was fine. I did have to bake about 25 min longer but I had overripe strawberries and I tossed in a few more than called for so that would easily account for that. Thank you for the recipe!",
