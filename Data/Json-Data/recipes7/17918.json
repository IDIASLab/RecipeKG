I just couldn't bring myself to use the full 1 1/2 cups of butter in the cupcakes though (it just seemed a bit much to me), so I only used 1 cup, and that worked just fine. They were still moist and tasty. I also used buttermilk in place of the regular milk, and really enjoyed that flavor as well. For the frosting, it just wasn't my favorite. I think that's just my own preference, though, because I prefer the taste and ease of American buttercream frostings. Overall, I like the cupcake recipe, with using just 1 cup butter and buttermilk in place of regular milk. I got 24 cupcakes out this, and they were perfectly done in 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",

I only made 1/2 a batch and double checked to make sure I read it right. For 1/2 a batch 1 c of butter made it more buttery than the standard buttercream frosting. I wanted a Swiss merguine for that light airy not heavy sweet and butter. For that reason I would add 1Tsp at a time until you reach the desired flavor I wish I would ve done 1 Tblsp at a time so as not to hv wasted the effort that went into double boiler seperating egg whites waiting for sugar to dissolve only to end up with essentially silky buttercream frosting in the end.",
