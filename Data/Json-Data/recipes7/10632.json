That layer of chocolate chips does not melt completely, and although these are very tasty, they\u2019re just a bit on the sweet side for me.

I used a little more white chocolate chips than called for and a lot less confectioner's sugar(maybe 1 or 2 Tablespoons). I don't have a sifter so I just took a pinch at a time and spread it over the top. So so good! Can't wait to have another reason to make these again.....I'm thinking we need to BBQ again this weekend!",
