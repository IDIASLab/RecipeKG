I let the batter rest for ten minutes before frying to allow the baking powder to activate a bit and let the flour absorb the liquid. It turned out beautifully; these pancakes are fluffy and flavorful and I will definitely be making them again soon. Be sure to let the batter rest for a few minutes to ensure maximum fluffiness.",
