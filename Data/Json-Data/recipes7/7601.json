In place of the pickle lettuce and tomato we had sauteed mushroom onion and peppers. I also added some fried banana. Left out the sugar and salt and pepper and substituted american for the cheddar cheese. Actually we all had a little different version my daughter only had the bacon cheese and peanut butter. I opted to forego the bacon. Overall everyone enjoyed these and in spite of the high calories we will make again.",
