I only use enough to lightly coat the berries on top to kind of \"gel\" things together. This is so refreshing not overly sweet and perfect for any summer get-together. If you like strawberries graham cracker crust and rich creamy cheeses...........then this is for you.:) (P.S.- I know in some areas Neufchatel would be difficult to find. You can use any smooth & creamy cheese. Just add less or more depending on the richness & consistency).",
