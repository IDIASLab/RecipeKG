I made a double batch, for a yield of 12 mini loaves. (baking time on these little loaves is about 30-45 minutes). The only one change I opted for was ONE extra egg, for a total of five eggs (double recipe). I shared one loaf with my family, and we all agreed this is a five-star recipe. Very moist, dense, rich in flavor. Would be delicious as an accompaniment to a good, hot cup of coffee or cocoa :) I also think Santa would be tickled pink to find warm  slices of this delicious bread waiting for him, with a glass of cold milk!",
