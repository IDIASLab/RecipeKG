I have made these many times with \u201cJennys recipe and they turn out perfect. Thought I would give your recipe a try, as it makes more. Big mistake. Please revise your liquid amount to add, either with 2 whole eggs, 3 more tablespoons of sour cream and double the rum. As I had to do.Otherwise some people will just end up throwing everything out, as it is very, very dry and won\u2019t form any kind of dough.",
