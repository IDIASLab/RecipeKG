Turn the heat off a little before the desired color as it will continue to darken and it will burn if you are not careful. Very carefully and using oven mitts, swirl pan around while sugar is still soft to cover bottom and sides. It will get thicker as it cools and eventually harden as a lollipop. Set pan aside to cool.\" \n\nThe recipe was changed by the website; Im ok with that, however the reasons I do the caramel straight into the pan are: 1) melted sugar is VERY hot and the less transfer the better 2) one less pot to clean.\n\nIf you must use a separate pot (for ex. for ramekins), then I suggest a heavy non-stick saucepan with a good non-metal handle instead of a skillet. The melted sugar will flow out better.\n\nI also DONT use a towel under the pan. Im sure it doesn't afect the quality of the final product; you decide how to do the 'baine Marie' (ba\u00f1o de Mar\u00eda in Spanish).\nHope you like my recipe!!!",

I used coconut extract (1 Tablespoon) as I didn't have any coconut-flavored rum in the house and didn't really want to face any stores on Christmas Eve. I also added 2 Tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons of vanilla simply because I like a really strong flavor. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 well 2 reasons actually and I may come back and modify later but the first is I haven't actually finished it or eaten it yet but so far by all accounts it is shaping up just beautifully! My ONLY problem is that the amount of flan mixture is much too much for my 9-inch round by 3.5-inch high baking dish and I had to make a second batch of caramel and divide it into 2 separated flans....Maybe this is just my experience but the mixture filled my dish to the brim and I was afraid of it being too thick and spilling over so I used a 2nd pan and divided the mixture to make 2 flans.:) Thanks for the recipe!",

I always make the caramel in the microwave (not the ideal way but it works). 1 cup sugar 1/2 cup water in a pyrex. 15 minutes later (microwaves are all different though) I've got the perfect colored amber caramel. I bought just one 8oz block of cream cheese because I didn't pay attention so I used that and it was still great. I loved the flavor the texture the consistency the ease to make...everything. I only had an 8 X 3 pan so it ended up taller (thicker) and therefore I had to bake about 30 min longer. No biggie. Thank you for yet another delicious recipe Milly!",
