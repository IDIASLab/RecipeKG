Just \"knead\" it with the spoon if you don't want to get your hands sticky. I needed to shorten the baking time, so I divided the dough into 12 greased muffin cups. It worked great. PLUS it made more of the yummy, crispy edges. We LOVED this and will make it often!!",

We saved a little bit just so we could see what it would taste like cold.  I agree with the other reviewers, the bake time is way too long.  I cooked it about 25-30 minutes and it came out perfect!  Also, instead of kneeding it on a floured surface and making a round loaf, I put it in a bread pan and it turned out fantastic!  To the person who said it was a wet lumpy dough, that's how it was for me too.  I didn't add any more four and just baked it and it turned out great!  I'll definitely be making this again!",
