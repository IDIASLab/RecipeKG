Since we like tart, did reduce sugar to 1-1/2 cups also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to egg mixture. Also replaced part of starch with almond meal to reduce carbs a bit. Baking description and times were very accurate. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. Have second batch in oven now and plan to make this whenever we can find rhubarb.",

I used 4 cups of rhubarb 4 eggs and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar added about a teaspoon of vanilla and replaced the regular white rice flour in the rhubarb mixture with sweet white rice flour. I used rhubarb that I had in the freezer from last year which I didn't thaw prior so the additional rhubarb and the fact that it was frozen added to my baking time by about 15 minutes. My family loved it and I will definitely make it again.",

My daughter can\u2019t have rice so I used XO flour. I didn\u2019t use potato or tapioca flour because I didn\u2019t see the point. I used corn starch for thickening the rhubarb mix. I used at least 6 cups of rhubarb and added about 3/4 cup coconut cream to the eggs and sugar. I didn\u2019t reduce the sugar because of the extra rhubarb. I would have given this 5 * but thought too many different flours were used unnecessarily.",
