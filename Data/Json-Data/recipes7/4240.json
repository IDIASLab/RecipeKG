It originally was featured in \"Winners- Best Of Bridge\" cookbook. A few ingredients are missing in this posting that really will make this a fantastic dish:     1) Add 1/4 tsp of thyme to the flour for additional seasoning  2) Add 1/2 tsp of salt to the lemon juice, apple juice and sugar. DO NOT cook it before pouring over the chicken to bake- simply mix the 4 ingredients together, stir to dissolve and pour over the chicken. Much simpler!    By adding salt and thyme, the dish really does become memorable.",

Also used apple cider because that's what I had on hand. Turned out so delicously moist and yummy. I think I will make this next time we have company over.",
