I am not a decorator at all hence why my icing and decorating leaves something to be desired lol but I did follow this recipe exactly for both the cupcake and the frosting and both are awesome. Perhaps more lemon flavour (Im a lemonaholic) and I may try using coconut extract in the frosting next time too.",

It seems a little dense...trying to figure out how to fix that next time...I did not find them too sweet They may need a little less flour..or just more milk..it is a good recipe to use as a base for other flavors too it seems. I did not use lemon extract. I used concentrated lemon juice...(it gave it a lighter lemon flavor...)..for a strong lemon flavor I would suggest using actual fresh lemons. I did not use the frosting recipe...I wanted cream cheese frosting...I find a very easy recipe on foodnetwork.com. I think I will start using this recipe for cupcakes. I did add a little more sugar not a lot more. I will see if my fiance likes it. I filled the cupcake liners almost all the way..maybe 3/4 full and they did round up pretty nice. The batter was a bit thicker too the last ones I made had a very watery batter...which is why I think these may have needed a little more milk..",

I made these as both mini and normal size cupcakes and I think the mini's taste much better than the full sized ones. The first batch I did not much lemon flavor in the cupcake so I doubled the amount of lemon in the second batch. The three stars is for the full size cupcake for the mini's I would give it four stars. I still think they could use a little more lemon flavor in the cupcakes though but everyone else loved them. I cooked the mini's for 12 minutes. You definitely need to double the amount of frosting though as most of the lemon flavor is from the frosting which is why the mini's tasted better.",

I love that u can smell the lemon as well as taste it I gave half of the sugar they put here and it was still way too sweet for me (so you can imagine putting the actual sugar listed in the recipe). I would recommend putting a lot less sugar like half less then listed here. Also frosting wasn't that great too sweet and the texture turned out weird.
