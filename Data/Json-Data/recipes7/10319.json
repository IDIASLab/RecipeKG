I mixed up the sugars but adding more brown sugar than white especially in the filling. I also added cinnamon to the filling and an extra sprinkle on top of the rolls before baking. I found it helpful to pulse the walnut and sugar filling together in the food processor. I pre-sliced the rolls before baking and then finished slicing them one they were cool. Everyone loved this and it definitely something I would make again!",
