The result is a light and airy cookie that's crisp, packed with flavor, and addicting! It's hard to stop at one. You can switch out the semi-sweet chocolate with your favorite chocolate flavor or just leave the chocolate off altogether. Don't be fooled by the small amount of chocolate because this cookie packs a lot of flavor. These are super easy to make.",

I was worried when I was making them because I used a small scoop to ensure even sized cookies and the dough didn't seem to stick together very well because it was so tender. I didn't bother to roll them into balls, just scooped them onto the parchment paper, flattened with the bottom of the glass and baked. They came out of the oven a bit delicate ( ok, I didn't wait til they cooled before I tried to cool them on the racks). The next morning they were sturdy and worked well for the exchange. My husband is a big coconut fan so I may add 1/2 tsp coconut extract next time, but they were delicious as is. Perfect with tea.",

I made them even easier by adding 1 cup of mini chocolate chips in with the batter instead of drizzling it over the top and that worked out great. I gave 4 stars because the next time I make the recipe I will alter it to my preference. The almond flavoring was very strong my kids and husband thought these smelled and tasted like Christmas cookies. I will use half the almond extract next time and make up for it with actual almonds.
