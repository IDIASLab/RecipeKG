It looked lovely after it was baked. Also used remaining apples chopped in batter. I further followed recommendations and added 1/2 cup buttermilk. Cake was still very dry. I found the flavour rather bland. Maybe more cinnamon would have helped. If you make this cake I strongly recommend at least 3/4 cup of milk into the batter. I can't imagine how dry it would be without the extra liquid. I rated it a 4 to be fair to the submitter. I think it's not a bad recipe just not to my taste. Thanks mavijac",
