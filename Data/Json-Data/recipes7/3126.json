I couldn't find the pepper paste in any store so I substituted with a Vietnamese chili paste and that was WAY too spicy the heat overpowered the taste; next time I'll have to find the real stuff for this recipe. This is awesome when served with lettuce leaf and rice. when we have had this at restaurants it is served with a paste-like condiment- do you know what that is and how to make it? Thanks for delicious authentic Korean Recipes!",

You must also add some sesame oil to the marinade for an authentic flavor.\nVinegar is not really a traditional Korean ingredient. Most people who live in a built up area can find Gochu Jang which is Korean hot bean paste. Substitute that for the vinegar.",
