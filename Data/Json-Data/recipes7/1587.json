So the next time I made it I used 2 1/2 tsp. coconut extract & 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and it was much better - the coconut taste is perfect. I made it for a party of 20 and everyone said it was PERFECT. It takes 1 hr. & 20 minutes to cook if you use 1 large dish. Easy to make and definately a keeper!",
