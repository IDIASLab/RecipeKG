There's no dominant flavor all ingredients share equally in an outstanding dressing the sweet-hot-sour elements are just about perfect. Served over grilled pineapple slices today but I can see drizzling this over grilled chicken tenders sliced cucumbers mixing into cole slaw using as a dip for egg rolls etc. Thanks BarefootMama for sharing your recipe.",
