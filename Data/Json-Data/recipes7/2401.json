My son is allergic to peanuts so I used almond butter instead of PB apple cider vinegar instead of white 2T soy margarine and 1T flax oil instead of canola. I also used 1 C oat flour and 1/8 C pastry flour in place of all purpose flour. He's allergic to corn so I used my home-made baking powder. With that said these are the MOST AMAZING CUPCAKES I'VE EVER HAD!!!!! The smell was incredible they are light and fluffy and just oh so delicious! They are a bit sweet but that's perfect because I didn't ice them. Oh man these are fantastic! Prepared as I have it's only 150 calories per cupcake. These are fantastic and will become a weekly treat around here! My poor kid it's nice to know that I can still give him a yummy treat!! Thank you so much Caiti Ann for this superb recipe!:)",

For the second round I added more flour and got better results but they were so very dry. Something is off here but I didn't know exactly how to fix it. I recommend using paper baking cups at the very least. Don't trust a greased muffin pan on this recipe.",
