As a result, it was not as pliable as it should have been (little dry), making it a bit of a challenge to roll out to 11\u201dx18\u201d.  Putting that aside, these still turned out delicious.  My recommendation would be to let the brie get \u201cvery soft.\u201d  I was having some difficulty spreading it on the pastry, so I actually added more, which just oozed out when it baked.  If it\u2019s not completely covering the crust, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much because the cheese will melt, filling it in.  That little bit of brown sugar was succulent in the caramelized onions which on their own are already sweet\u2026it really works here.  The only thing I\u2019m on the fence about is the caraway seed, just not sure I\u2019ll add that the next time, or maybe just add less (personal taste, perhaps).  This is an awesome appetizer with excellent eye appeal, somewhat elegant, but easy to make, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
