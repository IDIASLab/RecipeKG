I cut the recipe in half, which made one bundt pan - added 1 tsp of salt to the flour (for half the recipe, if you are going to do the full recipe add 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons of salt) \nI needed to add about 10 minutes to the baking time.  I covered the top with a sheet of foil, to prevent over browning for those extra 10 minutes.  As a Chef once told me when asked how long to cook, \"Until it is done!\"  \nNote to self - butter and flour the pan, not just cooking spray.",
