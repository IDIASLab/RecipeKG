It sweet, moist, rises beautifully and is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have Rome Beauty apples, so I used a combination of apples that I had on hand.  Other than that, I would change a thing with this recipe. Apparently since this recipe has been handed down and made for over 37 years - if it ain't broke, don't fix it! All I had to do with this after it cooled, was to dust it with a little confectioners' sugar as if this beautiful cake needed anything else.  Thanks Janyce for a wonderful recipe that I hope many more people try, they'll be glad they did!",

For flavor, try replacing the 3/4 c white sugar with brown sugar to mix with the cinnamon and up the cinnamon to 4 tsp - also sprinkle some raisins or dates or dried cranberries for variety. Whole house smelled wonderful. I think with the healthy changes, this would make a nice breakfast addition.",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely phenomenal recipe! I just got a new fridge yesterday, and in unloading and reloading, I came upon a bag of cranberries that really needed to be used - NOW. So I first made cranberry sauce out of them, cooled it, and used it in this cake, in place of half the apples. I scraped 1/3 of the batter in the pan, topped with the cranberry sauce, put in another 1/3 of the batter, topped with the halved apple mixture, scraped in the remaining batter. The flavor is sensational, the texture super moist. Aside from the cranberries standing in for half the apples, I cut the flour back to 2-3/4 cup. I baked it for only 85 minutes. I checked on it at about 45 minutes, and it appeared to be browning early. So I placed a piece of foil on top for the remainder of the baking time. It came out with a nice, crunchy crust on top. I glazed it with a lovely caramel rum glaze: 3 Tb butter, 2 Tb brown sugar, 2 Tb white sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp dark rum, 2 Tb whipping cream, combined in a small sauce pan over medium-low heat, until it comes to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 3 minutes. Brush over the warm cake, right after you remove it from the pan. It's not a lot of glaze, but it's quite flavorful, just enough to point up the cake's ingredients to perfection and to impart a lovely sheen. BTW, I will try making it with only apples the next time. Yes, the cranberries and glaze were a little difference, but the cake flavor and texture remained unchanged, and gotta say, they're stellar.",

I substituted 1/2 C. of the oil with applesauce and didn't have the dryness problem some reviewers complained of, in fact mine turned out very moist. I also drizzled powdered sugar glaze over the warm cake and it was a nice touch. I didn't have Rome Beauty apples but just used whatever was in my fruit bin and it was great! I highly recommend this recipe, it is a great brunch cake for Spring!",
