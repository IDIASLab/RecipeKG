Some reviewers are correct; I have made a mistake and the flour should be glutinous rice flour which can also be called Mochiko. \nAlso, the green tea powder is optional as is freezing the red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste just makes the process less messy. \nFor the cooking time, one can lower it to 3 minutes and add 15 seconds at a time until the dough looks slightly translucent. However, be sure to keep the plastic wrap on for at least 3 minutes to keep the moisture in. \nI'm sorry for all the mistakes but I am looking into correcting the recipe soon. Thanks!",

I've made it twice experimenting with the microwave time - ours seems to heat things faster than others. You can also switch up the fillings. I've used super thick cheesecake pudding (1 1/2 c soy milk) as well as another batch with peanut butter. The red bean paste is our favorite but we make due with what we have. Solution for getting the mochi into balls is to put the batch on plastic wrap dusted with potato or tapioca (cornstarch works too) starch. Get some starch on one hand put a cut piece into that hand spoon in the filling and pinch up the sides with the not-so-dusted hand. Keeps for a day or two in tightly sealed container lined with parchment paper. The pudding ones should be eaten almost right away. Thank you Katrina for sharing!",
