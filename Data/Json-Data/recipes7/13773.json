Ok ok so I'm one of the stinkers who changed things up and not because I'm a great baker but because I don't have a fancy pan:-). I split the mix between two loaf pans which gave me two squat loaves. I also used half white and half brown sugar because I love brown sugar. Honestly I am super happy with how these turned out. So delicious! (I think I baked them for a total of 45-50 minutes. Started at 35 and kept checking them every five minutes after.) I will be making these again. Great way to use up those pears we intended to eat as healthy snacks but never got around to them.:-)",
