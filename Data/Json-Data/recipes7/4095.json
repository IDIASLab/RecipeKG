Adding coffee granules enhances the flavor of the chocolate.

(I am an avid Biscotti baker and this is not something that usually happens for me) the dough itself was really crumbly when it came to making the logs so I did knead it a little like I would a loaf of bread which made it a little better. Once the logs came out of the oven and I let cool for 10 minutes I did have a few crumble on me. As always I bake the first time on wax paper. Over all a good biscotti pity about the crumbling! I will play around a little with this recipe next time maybe more vanilla will keep it together better.",
