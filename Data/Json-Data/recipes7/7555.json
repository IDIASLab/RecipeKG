It also took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook and the prep took longer than 20 minutes also. I did not toast the coconut and I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown but other than those two minor changes I followed the recipe exactly. This is indeed a very dense bread and I'm sure that was the reason for the extra needed cooking time. As far as the flavor is concerned the banana flavor was hidden by the primary flavor of cinnamon with coconut being the next flavor I detected and I don't think anything would be gained from actually toasting the coconut. If I make this again I think I will do muffins so the dough will be done without over-browning.",
