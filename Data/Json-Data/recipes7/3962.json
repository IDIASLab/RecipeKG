I used Stash Premium Chai Spice black tea which uses exactly the spices called for in Masala Chai tea. I baked it right at 20 minutes and stuck a toothpick in the middle. It came out clean so I took them out of the oven and let them sit. When I cut them they were very moist but really didn't fall apart. One corner crumbled a tiny bit so I did what any noble baker would do: I ate it. Delish.",

The second time around I made the following changes: upped the cocoa powder to 1/3 cup the vanilla to a full teaspoon added one egg for improved texture used half white and half packed brown sugar added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and used \"chai butter\" instead of oil. To make that I simply simmered butter with a teaspoon of chai tea leaves for about 5 minutes then strained. If you want to keep the recipe vegan you can infuse the canola oil with chai as well and omit the egg I added. Make sure the chai tea is brewed very strongly -- I poured 1 cup boiling water over three tea bags and steeped for 20 minutes. The chai flavor was more pronounced but not overpowering. Next time I might add some extra ground cinnamon nutmeg and cloves for a spicier brownie.",

So of course I had to save this poor kid from a lifetime of dread and depression. This recipe was perfect and worked great. The trick might be to make the chai just right. I'm Bengali so I made it thick and heavy the way my family generally likes it with a \"Bengali Spice Chai\" teabag from Celestial Seasonings. The brownies came out rich and dense just how brownies should be. The chai undertone made it even better for me.",
