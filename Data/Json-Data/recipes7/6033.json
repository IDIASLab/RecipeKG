I used butter flavored shortening, mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans (just used what I had in the house). I also baked it a little differently; 20 min at 350, the middle was still soft so I lowered the temperature to 325 and baked it for another 8 minutes so I would not have burned edges. This worked PERFECTLY-center baked and edges still soft. This recipe really can take on different flavors depending on the add ins.",

For a smoother texture you can used instant or grind some or all of the oats in a food processor. I also use whole wheat flour. I have made it with lots of flavor variations. Some of the favorites were: ginger red chile and diced dried mango pieces; ground almond almond extract orange zest dried cranberries and white morsels; pecan and chocolate chips; chopped salted pistachios dark chocolate and cardamom; raisins chopped walnuts cinnamon; shredded coconut almond flakes and cocoa powder; etc. Can't go wrong. I recommend smoothing the batter in the pan and letting them cool completely before cutting them up. Freezes nicely.",
