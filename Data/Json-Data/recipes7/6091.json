It took about 20-25 minutes for our topping to get brown enough 30 minutes would have been too much. The main thing I liked is that you don't feel like you're eating pure sugar. The peaches shine and if you wanted to add a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to it you won't blow your diet. Pecans would also make a nice addition. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I used honey in place of brown sugar and brown rice flour in place of the cornstarch in the peach mixture. I used half whole wheat and half brown rice flour, 4 TBL vegan butter, and slightly less white sugar in the biscuit mixture. Thanks so much for submitting, I will be using this for apple cobbler also!",

I have not tried a lot of cobblers as I usually make crisps. I may just be accustomed to them. The dough soaks up too much of the sweet liquid. I made a couple of small changes to make it slightly healthier nothing completely recipe changing. I think, I will stick with my usual peach crisp recipe in the summer.",
