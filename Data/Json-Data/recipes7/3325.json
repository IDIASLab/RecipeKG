As a young adult, I tried to duplicate the recipe, and unable. I went back and begged her for the secrets of it. When I asked her how long it had taken to develop the tricky recipe, she flattened my ego by telling me she'd gotten it out of a magazine years before! I like to make it for Christmas.",

A whole cup of orange zest is an extremely large amount and I only had three oranges so I could only get about 2/3 of a cup. It did take a lot longer to cook on the stove than the recipe says. I think it was about 30 minutes altogether not counting assembling the cake ingredients. The cake did turn out a bit crumbly but it is so delicious warm out of the oven! I recommend it with a light powdered sugar vanilla glaze.",
