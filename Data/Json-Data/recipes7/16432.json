You can use as many layers of filo as you want, but be careful, since too many may not cook through, and the only way to mess this up is to undercook the dough. The top and bottom layers need to dry out, and thoroughly crisp up, otherwise, once the syrup gets ladled over, you'll have a soggy mess.",

One thing to watch out for is time; it can go from golden brown to blackened brown very quickly so keep an eye out after 45 minutes or so.",

I like the interesting taste the orange flower water adds although it gets lost once it's poured over the baklava. The top crisped up way too much and I didn't even leave it in the oven for the required amount of time so the liquid didn't absorb properly. Also there is too much liquid it's pooling at the bottom of the pan... probably because it didn't absorb properly. I'll stick to supermarket baklava that way I just buy what I want and am not stuck with copious amounts of it. Sorry Chef John - not a winner.",
