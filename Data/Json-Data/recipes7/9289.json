I decreased salt/sodium a bit & sugar due to family members with health issues - but you have to use enough to allow the flavored liquids to get into the meat. Used \"Red Robin\" seasoning salt for that ingredient; Used chopped celery - didn't have celery seed. I was only able to brine for 2 hrs. I did both split chicken parts & boneless/skinless chicken breasts. Conv roasted the split whole chicken; grilled the chicken breasts. Everyone loved the flavor & the juiciness.",
