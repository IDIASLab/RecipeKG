Viryta is usually homemade by descendants of Lithuanian immigrants, using recipes that have been handed down through the generations, and is a popular commodity around the holidays. It took me years to finally get someone to teach me how to make it; most of the people around Baltimore who make it are very secretive about their family recipes! I'd probably catch an earful if she knew I posted it online!",

As for @Vern, our family also made a hot version every Christmas Eve.  That was whiskey, lemon, honey and caraway seed based.  Polar opposites yet 100% Lithuanian traditions in our homes.  One tip for the cold version...skip the grain and use a high alcohol rum like Appletons  151 in 1:1 substitution.  The rum gives it a nice depth of flavor that the grain cannot.  It still gives quite a kick...",
