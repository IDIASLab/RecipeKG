I didn't realize I needed 8 cups so 4 were fresh berries and 4 were frozen that we picked 2 weeks ago) and it was wonderful.  Not to mention super easy. Helpful hints:  2 quarts worked out to 8 cups of berries.  If you fill the jars to the top of the jars, you will get 3 250ml jars (or 3 cups).  I filled 2/3 of the way and filled the rest with the juice and ended up with 4 250ml jars (or 4 cups). Wanted to make again, but my husband forgot to bring home the berries that were on sale this week and the sale ended today!  Thanks for such a different idea!",

The steps I skipped turned out to be the ones that make it gel up so I have a sauce rather than a chutney. The specific step to NOT skip is the one where you remove the berries and then boil the sauce for 4 minutes. I'm guessing since I left the berries in it for that step I caused extra liquid to be released. This was still a very delicious appetizer served over cream cheese! Thanks for the recipe!",
