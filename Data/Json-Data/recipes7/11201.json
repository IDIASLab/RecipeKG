And I'm glad I did, we thoroughly enjoyed it.  For anybody unfamiliar with the \"impossible\" concept,  ALL ingredients go into the blender, then you pour into a pie pan, and bake.  Yes, it's that easy.  The only change I made was subbing Truvia for the sugar, and I actually cut back the Truvia a bit, since we're not into \"too sweet\" these days. If you're an eggnog, coconut and custard fan, give this one a try; I don't think you'll be disappointed.",
