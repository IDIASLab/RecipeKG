I have lived in Dubai for two years where there is plenty of authentic Indian food so I can testify that this Ras Malai is indeed very authentic and of great flavour. I used part skim ricotta cheese but it has not affected the result. This dessert is truly outstanding. One tip is to take the cheese balls out when they are warm since mine broke a little bit after they are cold.",
