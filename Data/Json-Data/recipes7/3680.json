I added some sour cream and heavy cream to the mixture since it was just cream cheese, knew it needed something else to provide a better, creamier cheesecake. I still think I should have added more, possibly another brick of cream cheese as well as more sour and heavy cream. I made a choc. drizzle for the top of 2 oz. melted semi sweet choc. and 1/3 c. heavy cream. After setting in the fridge the choc. was hardened a bit and I think it really helped the flavor of the cake. I think the recipe is a bit too plain written as-is, needs a bit of doctoring.",

                "reviewBody": "I give the recipe 5 stars because it is a great starter, but the recipe is unfinished. First of all, you should never have only cream cheese in the batter. I added a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk and a cup of vanilla yogurt. When you add the eggs, separate them first and stir the yolk and whites separately. This is a technique used for making cakes but for cheesecake will make the end result a light and fluffy cheesecake. I prefer it this way because you can really only take a couple bites of a heavy cheesecake. Then I used double oreos for everything. Double the oreo batter for the crust and double how many crushed oreos you put in the batter. Then I broke off chunks of oreos to add to the batter as well. While baking, I took the advice of another review on here and started the temp at 350 then lowered it by 25 degrees every 20 minutes while baking (bake for a total of an hour) then turn the heat off and leave the cake in the oven with the door closed for an additional hour. I didn't use a waterbath but using this method, the cheesecake came out perfectly smooth and crack-free!! It was incredible and we didn't even wait for it to cool completely before eating it because it looked so good!! Will definitely be making this again. One last note, make sure ALL your ingredients are at room temperature. Hope this helps and enjoy your cheesecake!!! :)",
