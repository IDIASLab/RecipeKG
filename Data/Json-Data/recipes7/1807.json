Then it is so smooth one of my guests unknowingly served her 2 year old! Use premium vanilla ice cream to keep it chilled in the punch bowl. I like to shape the ice cream in a star molds, and use them one-at-a-time to chill the eggnog throughout the evening.",

The fact is, the chance of getting salmonella from eating raw eggs is 1 in 30,000. And actually, in a healthy human body, salmonella can't do any harm. Most of us have some small amount of salmonella introduced into our systems all the time. In a healthy body the salmonella is controlled and killed by healthy intestinal flora in the gut.\n\nIt's a shame people don't get their facts straight before posting a review of an untried recipe, leaving 1 star and ruining the overall rating.\n\nHappy Holidays (and try not to drink 30,000 eggs-worth of eggnog)!! :o)",

Also I have a gelato machine -- and this egg nog is heavenly when it's frozen!! I urge any egg nog lover not to reserve this recipe just for Yule. Make it year-round and no one will criticize you.
