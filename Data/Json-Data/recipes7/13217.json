They were super easy, crispy (like a shortbread) and had a nice peanut butter taste.  But I prefer my cookies to be chewy.  Great if you need a gluten-free option though.   So my 3-stars is based on the exact recipe.\n\nThen I dipped them so one half was covered in melted chocolate, took them to work, and people gobbled them up.  I still didn't \"love\" them though.\n\nAfter reading some other reviews I decided to make them again, but used brown sugar instead of white.  I liked this much better, it gave them a softer texture without losing any of the simplicity or flavor.  I would give the brown sugar cookie a 4 star rating.",
