The only other time I had tried crepes was at IHOP and I did not care much for them so I was hesitant and only made half a batch, should of made the full recipe. While warming the bananas for my husbands, I added a few pecans for crunch and they were even more delicious. He even loved the crepes themselves without any topping.
