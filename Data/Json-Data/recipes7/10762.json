After many attempts (10 full batches, to be exact) at adjusting my recipe, this is what my taste buds came up with. I hope you will give it a try and enjoy it as much as my family and I do. For the ultimate pizza experience use Brothers&reg; pepperoni and Mozzarellissima&reg; pizza cheese.",

I don't like my savory foods to be sweet 9/10, and I would still cut the pepper down to 1/4 cup and maybe up the sugar to 2/3 cup.\n\nThe recipe is also bigger than it might originally seem if you don't note that the broth accounts for more of the volume than the tomatoe sauce -- different than typical pizza sauce. My guess is this made around 24 cups of sauce. Easily enough for a year of casual home pizza-ing.",

I'm making another batch tonight and this time I'm making the following changes- using 1.5 cartons reduced sodium chicken broth and 1.5 cartons reduced sodium beef broth (this should help with browning) only adding celery salt and seasoning salt to taste and finally replacing 1.5 cans of tomato paste with 1.5 cans of additional celery/onion/mushroom puree mixed with a bit of flour. Hopefully these changes should give me something more along the lines of what I'm used to both in taste and appearance. Thanks for the base to work with Mel! I know you put a lot of effort into it.",
