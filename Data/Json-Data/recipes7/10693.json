To improve nutritional quality I used whole wheat flour and a natural zero calorie sweetener to replace the sugar. Besides the small bit of butter, these \"cookies\" are very filling and relatively healthy. \n   As far as taste, I call these \"cake cookies,\" because they are like perfectly bite size pieces of moist chocolate cake. They were not as \"cookie\" like but I found that enjoyable. Overall an easy, yummy, and healthy alternative to standard cookie or cake making. ---And by the way, in case you're concerned--- when eating the cookies you cannot even tell there is kale. It just adds tons of nutrients!",

I used whole eggs instead of just whites since we have our own chickens I can't waste any part of my lovely eggs.  More tips: I really crammed that kale into my 1/3 measuring cup so I got some extra in there, use a good quality food processor and really pur\u00e9e it well, & I also put an extra tablespoon of good quality baker's chocolate (56% cacao) in.",
