After doing some research, making dozens of different dressings, and trying to find the flavor that I like, I came up with this dressing for coleslaw that became a hit. I'm always asked for this recipe. What surprised me was at a potluck when a culinary chef asked me for my recipe. He told me that it was one of the best he had ever tasted since he had left the southern part of the USA.",

I mixed it with the slaw and gave it a few hours to blend.  The taste is very good, and it made a nice cole slaw, but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Would have liked it a tad better had the dressing been thicker.  Served it with 'Jan's Loaded Pizza Fries' from AR and we enjoyed a nice dinner.  Thanks rlt11_NMC, for sharing your recipe.",

I didn't actually measure the ingredients, but this turned out exceptional.  I used whole milk instead of lowfat milk because dairy fat is actually not your enemy and I probably didn't put a full 1/3 c of sugar but it was close.  That said, this recipe is great and I highly recommend it.  My people, whom are notoriously critical of all food, loved it.",
