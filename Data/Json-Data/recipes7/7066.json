                "reviewBody": "Tasted GREAT - not Dry. Dryness is the result of over mixing and/or over-baking. TIP: Since there is no butter in this recipe I recommend using the paper/foil baking cups in a muffin pan as mine stuck a little bit (i used butter to grease pan) and about 4 of my tops got pulled off while removing them from pan (even after cooling for 5 minutes in the pan). RECIPE Modifications: I was out of lemon juice so I had to sour the milk with some freshly squeezed lime and (mandarin) orange juice because thats all I had on hand!! I used Craisins instead of fresh cranberry - the OceanSpray website said you don't need to soak them - they are ready to use and the substitute is 3/4 cup of craisins for every 1 cup of fresh cranberries. I skipped the almonds because I didn't have any on hand (seeing a trend? we just moved 1000 miles away so our kitchen is thin right now) - so I just filled the cups with batter and popped them in the oven. BAKING NOTE: Even at 400 this recipe took longer than 18-20 minutes for me (i do not live in CO); toothpicks came out battery at 18 minutes. I rotated the pan at this point to even out the browning of the top edges then I added about 7 minutes of bake time plus I let then sit in the oven for about 5 minutes after I shut it off. OVERALL very easy very tasty - just plan for the extra time to bake! Enjoy!",

I decided to add half a clementine that I lightly pureed in my food processor to the batter. Since I did this I reduced the milk/lemon juice mixture just a tad. Used the same clementine to made a tangerine sugar to top the muffins with. I zested it into turbinado sugar mixed well let sit for a bit then topped muffins with it before baking. These are fabulous muffins. Light and fluffy! (I found they only needed about 15-16 minutes- so watch your baking times).",
