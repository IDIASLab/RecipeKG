It uses an Oreo&reg;-cookie crust instead of the traditional graham cracker crust, adding a bit of a chocolate accent. Plus, it uses fat-free cream cheese, but proves to taste rich and creamy for a banana-y treat! Garnish with whipped cream and sliced bananas, if desired.",

Since I only had a 10 inch springform pan, this might\u2019ve had something to do with it.  Then, I added about 1/8 cup of corn starch when I whipped the cream cheese to give it a lighter texture. I got this from the Junior\u2019s Cheesecake recipe from New York. I also added about a teaspoon of banana extract to the cheesecake mixture as well. Next time I make this, I\u2019ll probably use something like vanilla wafers for the crust. The chocolate was nice. But, I think the vanilla would make it lighter and more elegant. I also froze the completed cake for the first hour after adding the topping to help is set a little faster. It\u2019s delicious! And, it\u2019s held up really well for a couple days after, too.",
