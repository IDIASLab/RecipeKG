                "reviewBody": "Wow! I have made pies for years so when I read through this one and saw the jiffy corn mix poured into the bottom I was skeptical as I\u2019d never made a pie that way. It made a lovely base for the fruit, so thumbs up for that step. I needed to use up some apples and nectarines; came across this by doing a search with those ingredients. So glad I did!! I used a Pillsbury pie crust and had to make my own jiffy corn mix(found it online). Followed the recipe as written. The only hiccup I had was the baking of the lower crust with the muffin mix for 5 to 8 minutes. Go for the 5, I over baked it a little and it wouldn\u2019t press into the top crust so next time I\u2019ll lessen that a little but it didn\u2019t affect the taste or appearance of the pie. I also loved the flavor that the apple peels gave to the sugar mixture that was poured over the fruit. We did not find it to be too sweet. I used my food processor to slice the apples and nectarines thin, that\u2019s the way we like our apples in pies Served with vanilla ice cream. I had to go back for a second little piece it was so good! Five stars!",
