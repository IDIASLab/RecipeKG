Lastly, I only cooked it for 35 minutes, given that it was a half recipe.  I\u2019m only rating the filling, which was excellent!!  I never thought pluots could make such a yummy pie.  I will say that the crumbles added a nice crunch, but the crust, as specified in the recipe, would probably supply a similar effect.  Thanks for sharing!!",
