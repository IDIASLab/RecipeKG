I reduced the sugar by 1/3 and improvised on the frosting to make it non-dairy.  I melted some non-dairy semisweet  chocolate chips and some cocoa butter (2:1 ratio about 3/4 cup altogether after melting)  in the microwave  and mixed in some honey (about 2 tablespoons) and a bit of corn oil (roughly 2 teaspoons) into it until it was spreadable.  I'm sure the frosting listed  in the recipe is better, but this cake is so good with any chocolate frosting.   Will make again.",

The crunch on top was a delight. \n\nMy family devoured it warm with coffee or milk (for the kids). My 2 year old could not get enough! Thank you for the base recipe. Loved the end product with tweaks.",
