        "description": "This is a waffle cookie seasoned with anise seed and anise oil.  It is baked on a waffle iron. It is not a really sweet cookie, but it was sent to soldiers during WWII because they keep well and the flavor seems to get better with each passing day. Lasts about 2 weeks unrefrigerated. Handed down from my German-Swiss grandmother. You can also use lemon or vanilla flavoring instead of the anise seed and oil; of course, it changes the flavor completely, but if you're looking for a nice 'not too sweet' cookie, this recipe is a good place to start. My children love making these - it's fun, it's easy.",

Had to hold down my pizelle iron the whole time and they just came out thick and would not fill the whole space. Tried larger balls and still did not turn out. Too difficult to use as a dough. Ended up making this dough into a batter by adding cream and eggs. Most pizelle batters use about double the butter and double the eggs as this one.",
