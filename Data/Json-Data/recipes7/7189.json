The original recipe was really good and my family enjoyed it more the next day when the flavors melded a bit more. Still it didn't have quite the \"zip\" I wanted for the kale hence the 4 stars. I made it again with slight modification - my rating is not based on my changes. In lieu of the white sugar I used 2 1/2 Tbs Blue Agave syrup; I substituted 1 tsp Six Pepper seasoning blend 1 rounded tsp crushed red chili pepper flakes for the red chili pepper powder; and added 1 tsp minced garlic. Instead of whisking the ingredients I pulsed everything in a mini food processor. As with the original recipe I suggest making this a day before needed to get the depth of the flavors.",
