The results more than make up for the long, labor-intensive prep and proofing process. There are hundreds of these in our kitchens and dining rooms around the holidays! The anise gives a very distinctive licorice-like flavor. If someone tastes one for the first time and doesn't like it, I take the rest of the cookie and eat it so it doesn't go to waste. I actually don't bake long enough for the cookies to turn brown.",
