I doubled the recipe for two loaves and was glad I did.  The recipe has a few extra steps but is worth it.  I followed the recipe.  The baking time for me was one hour and 15 minutes.  I  baked them until a knife inserted came out clean.  Then they were cooled for 15 minutes before I removed them from pans.  I hope you enjoy them as must as I did.  My mother would make an apple cake when I was little.  She is gone now and when I took a bite, it sent me back into good memories.",

I baked it for about 75 minutes and wondered after I cut into it if it should have baked longer because the slices were falling apart.  This bread has 1/2 cup of applesauce and three fresh apples, so to say it's moist is an understatement.  Unfortunately, it's almost too moist IMO.  I was unable to slice it without it crumbling.    However, it is delicious, and we ended up just eating it in a bowl sort of like an apple cobbler.   If that's acceptable to you, go for it because the taste is very good.  I'm going to try this recipe again with one apple shredded and one apple chopped to see if that will improve the texture and make it sliceable.  BTW, I followed the recipe to the letter.",

I doubled the topping and pushed it down into bread building up middle in hopes of no overflow into the oven.  Very moist, just right amount of spices and was quite delicious!  Whole family enjoyed it!  This is my third time to make this bread and first recipe of an apple bread to try.  There's no need for me to pick another!
