Me too. Thankfully this is a great recipe that does not disappoint. Zippy is a great word for it--enough spice that it's 'kicked up' without being hot. After adding two cans of stewed tomatoes I ended up adding an additional can of diced while the soup was simmering. I think next time I'll just opt for diced tomatoes as the stewed chunks seem too big in the soup. Instead of rice I used 1/2 cup of Orzo that I had on-hand. Other than that I followed the recipe over the course of two days. I made the broth the evening we had the turkey refrigerated it overnight skimmed the fat that separated and then added all additional ingredients the next day. I already printed this and have added it to my trusty recipe binder in my kitchen. Thanks for the great soup M Vidito",

I started with 3 quarts of stock I had already prepared, the recipe didn't really call for a specific amount of liquid so I eyeballed the rest. I only used one can of stewed tomatoes and half the rice, which was perfect for our taste, it didn't absorb all of the liquid leaving it more like soup than stew. Didn't add the corn. We liked the hearty nature of this turkey soup and would make this again! Thank you!",
