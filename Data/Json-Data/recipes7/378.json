The original recipe called for Shortening but I always use the brick baking margarine not the soft tub spreadable margarine. Butter of course can be used. The pastry is suppose to be somewhat like a sugar cookie. Start with a drop of milk and only use enough to pull the dough together. Or try leaving it out I suppose it would depend on the humidity. Thanks to everyone who has tried this The Zanetti family would be proud they brought it from Italy almost 50 yrs ago!",

I added an extra egg yolk in my custard and I grated one lemon in the custard to give it more flavor I would of used an orange but I didn't have one. I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of half and half in the custard. The dough came out perfectly I used organic flour and I don't think it needs a lot of milk but I almost used up the entire 1/2 cup just check and see if the dough is too dry. I made the dough in my kitchenaid and it came out perfectly. Cooked them for exactly 22 mins. Gave it 4 stars just because I amended it.",
