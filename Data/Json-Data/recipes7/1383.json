A sweet lady in our church always made it, since everyone requested it. Since I've grown up, I'm always on the search for Korean restaurants serving up some delicious bulgogi. Let me say, my search will go no further than my kitchen from now on. Love, love, LOVE this recipe. I was worried about making it from scratch as I have no real experience cooking any sort of Korean food, but I'm glad I tried it.  Couple of tips. If you have a larger food processor with a slicer blade, run your slightly frozen beef through it. So ridiculously thin! Also, if you don't have access to a grill, go ahead and make it in a very hot skillet on the stove.",

I marinated for 6 hours and think next time I will leave it in overnight, just so the flavor has more time to soak in. But a truly great recipe! Yum!\n \nEDIT: I made this again and it marinated for two days, which was WAAAYYY too long! The soy sauce overpowered the other flavors. My recommendation is to marinate for no more than 24 hrs!",

I added a little soy to the marinade and added a little extra garlic.  There's no way you can screw this up unless you cook the london broil too long or don't slice it thin enough.

DH's best friend's parents are from Korea and I'm sure it's just regional that makes the difference but we learned from his parents to use pear or kiwi in the marinade. If you do, only marinate for 20-30 min. We also use tri tip, which is personal preference. Grilling is also the best and I recommend using brown sugar instead of white, but again, that is personal preference.",
