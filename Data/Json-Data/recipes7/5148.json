I use very large cucumbers which I first peel and scrape seeds out of then cut up into sticks. They fit in the jar easier. I sometimes add a drop or two of cinnamon oil to the syrup for more cinnamon flavor. This recipe is often made with sliced cucumbers where seeds are cut from center to form a ring. These are known also as Wedding Ring Pickles. Most people are surprised they are made from cucumbers they seem more like apples.",
