I must admit I had no idea what you meant by \"jelly filled roll cakes\" and a friend of mine said, \"She means Little Debbie-style cakes with jelly filling.\"  I don't typically buy those types of dessert items so I substituted a sponge cake and topped it with some home made raspberry jam and cut that up.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a \"T\".  The second time I made it, I made it into 2 layers, topped it off with chocolate chips, whipped cream and raspberry sauce....drizzled down the inside of the bowl...and both were fabulous.  Thanks for a \"keeper\" recipe.  I made it in July, not Winter, and was so happy I will make it again...soon.",
