I'm not a fan of tropical mixtures and this pie was completely tropical. (Really tangy) I think I'll just risk a plum pie next time since the plum was what I wanted to taste. I didn't taste any. The baking time wasn't quite long enough and I didn't notice until it was cooled the next morning. Plus the filling was completely runny once it cooled. The night before it was thicker almost goo. But in the morning it was tangy soup. Oh well I couldn't eat it but my brother could so 2 stars.",
