He wanted donuts, but when we came across this recipe, well the name is kind of catch-ie!   The first couple came out looking like mutant eggs! So we kind of rolled them more oval and flattened them a little, since the hubster insisted they should look like beaver tails... We did the sugar and cinnamon, yum! But then we noticed the cook's note on the bottom and went savory and experimented. Also nice for a change in flavor. I'd love to try it with the maple spread, but alas. Hell even maple syrup here in France is pretty pricey and kind of a hunt to find. So we went with homemade jams, like apricot, strawberry and blackberries. The hubster went for the Nutella. We used a blue cheese/creme fraiche dip. That is some mighty fine chomping! Thanks for the recipe share! Tasty and fun.",

Now that I live in Utah you absolutely cannot get this anywhere. No one has ever heard of it. I found this recipe and tried today (July 4th) for the first time. My husband and kids were AMAZED. We all ate at least 4 pieces covered in cinnamon and sugar and we all agreed it was BETTER than what you get from the 4th of July vendors. My one change was this: we shaped the dough as the recipe said and found it was too thick to cook properly so we shaped it into ovals and then smooshed it out with our hands until the pieces looked more like thick tortillas and they cooked up perfectly. It has instantly become our new go-to 4th of July tradition.",
