Honey takes longer to digest again better for your diet. I also added raisins also used fat free evaporated milk and skim milk. You won't notice the lack of fat. I also took a readers idea for ground cinnamon. This really is one of those I will use forever...thank you for your recipe Diana.",

My grandmother's rice pudding recipe has eggs and butter so I think I am just being spoiled by that. It is good but it definitly lacks the fat/flavor of a genuine rice pudding. A great option for going lite though. Also to prevent it from getting crazy thick stop cooking it before it gets pudding thick; it will thicken up as it cools some more. If you miss the mark and cook until pudding thick I like to just stir in extra milk once it comes out of the fridge to get it back to a smoother texture.",
