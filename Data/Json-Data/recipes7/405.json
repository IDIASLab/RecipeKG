I used toothpicks to keep their shape. I served them with whipped cream and they were amazing!",

I used fresh sweet potatoes and boiled until soft and pureed it with the cinnamon since I didn't happen to have any canned on hand. I also had some bananas pretty close to being overly ripe so when making the chimichangas I went ahead and added a couple slices of banana before wrapping. I know the recipe says to place the sweet potato mixture in the center along the straight edge but that seemed to make them too fat to seal so I spread it in a line parallel to the cut edge and they came out much prettier. Will probably make again.",
