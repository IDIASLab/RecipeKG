Blackberries were plentiful in Southern Missouri in summer and she made the blackberry dumplings for her siblings instead of a cobbler.  I have never seen a recipe for the dumplings so I am thinking this is something my mother devised herself perhaps a quart of blackberries went further by making dumplings instead of a cobbler.",

Good very filling and easier to make and serve than a blackberry pie but if you're thinking light and fluffy move on. Also I used fresh berries that were on the sour side and 1.75C of sugar was still a little too much as was a whole 1t of salt. Definitely follow the instructions to add sugar \"to taste.\"",

Somthing he made when a young man in Ukraine. My Fathers' Mother passed away when he was 2 years old and he and his siblings also had to be very creative to feed the family!
