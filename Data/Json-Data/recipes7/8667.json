I checked my amount of ingredients and I did everything as listed. I don't think I'll make it again.",

My revisions: I chopped up the boneless chicken thighs and tossed them in the flour, and then sauteed them in a little bit of butter and garlic before putting them in the crock pot.  My family loves a hearty stew, so I added chopped mini gold potatoes along with the vegetables in the recipe.  I mixed a can of cream of celery (I would have used cream of chicken but didn't have any in my pantry) with the chicken broth and plenty of seasonings. I poured that over the chicken and vegetables and cooked it on high for about 3-1/2 hours, then switched to low for 2 hours or so, and mixed in a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up when I added the frozen peas.  I omitted the cream cheese it was so flavorful without it, but I may add it next time to see the difference.  Will definitely make again!",

I omitted the mushrooms and peas at the request of the boys and doubled the carrots. Next time I will use crinkle carrots because the chicken cooked down so much that it was almost shredded and the larger baby carrots didn't look right. I also used frozen chopped onions instead of fresh. I was surprised at the thickening quality of the cream cheese spread but it didn't add enough flavor compared to how the cheese tasted alone. Next time I am going to add Johnny's garlic seasoning blend to up the taste and maybe Alouette Cheese spread.",
