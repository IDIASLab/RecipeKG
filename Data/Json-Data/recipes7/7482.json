The noodles ARE put in uncooked (crunch them in the packet as well as you can before the wrapper breaks then crunch/ break up well when adding as the large \"groups\" don't hydrate well) and I like to put them in the dressing an hour or two before mixing the dressing through it all and serving depending on how much crunch you like. I also use sunflower nuts instead of the almonds (personal taste and I keep a jar on the fridge for most salads). I like the addition of raisins but dried apricots or craisens would be fun too. Really a great salad for a quick put together.",

Also the broccoli slaw bag I had was 12 oz. so I just used it all. Turned out great everyone loved it. Oh and I only used 1 pack Raman Noodles. I don't know why it was specified to use chicken Raman noodles since you're not using the broth packet so it doesn't matter what one you use. Hopefully it was less calories and same wonderful flavor.
