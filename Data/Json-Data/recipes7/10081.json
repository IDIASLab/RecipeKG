I used yellow cornmeal for color. I normally don't like sugary cornbreads, but I wanted to follow the recipe to the letter the first time. I Tablespoon did not make it too sweet so I'm glad I added it. This morning I ate it for breakfast with jam. Lends itself to sweet or savory meals. I don't think you can improve this recipe!
