Although I don't think it needs more sugar, especially since recipe calls for Halloween candy, which I didn't use.  I also used 1c. of light cream and 1/2 c 1% milk and instead of vanilla bean I used good vanilla extract.  Haven't baked it yet but can't wait to try it!   Oh, I also sprinkled cinnamon on the pound cake cubes.",
