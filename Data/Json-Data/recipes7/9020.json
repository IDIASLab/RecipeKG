If I repeat these I plan to just fry the mixture like pancakes.",

I threw in some chopped ham and a bit of shredded cheddar as well as rehydrated peppers and onions. I was even short an egg in a doubled recipe and used a powdered one and it STILL turned out great. I liked it with creamy chicken gravy as well as salsa. My family and my pantry thank you!",

Both had a great flavor and my son who doesn't like peppers even liked them so I would definitely recommend trying them. They were also fun to make and experiment with.",
