After reading reviews I decided to make some changes. First I dissolved the sugar in the liquids prior to pouring over bananas. Second I skipped adding the butter prior to baking. Then after baking I further reduced the remaining liquid (which was way too thin) to make more of a syrup consistency. All in all it was pretty good. My husband and I both thought toasting the coconut then sprinkling on top would be a good idea. I ate it alone and found tasty but a littlesweet. My husband put ice cream on top-which I found better tasting.",

Since alot of reviews said the sauce was liquidy and too sweet, I cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup and simmered the orange sauce in a saute pan until syrupy. I then sliced the bananas on the diagonal, and heated in the sauce for a couple of minutes. This recipe can be done completely on the stove top, no baking required. I served it over vanilla ice cream and topped it with toasted coconut. My family all loved it, and my son said it was almost as good as his favorite dessert, banana cream pie. It's a keeper and I will be making this again.",
