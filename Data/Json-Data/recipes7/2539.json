I also only had 1 cup of heavy cream and do not like pineapples. 1 cup whipping cream 1 1/4 cups 2% milk 4 tbsp coconut milk powder 1/2 pkg lemon pie filling 3/4 cup sugar 3 mashed bananas if i wasn't on a soft-food-only died i would have used less coconut powder and added the flaked coconut and walnut pieces. I was scared the frozen banana slices would be too hard so i mashed them however i will probably just slice them the next time i make this recipe. I'm giving this 3 stars as it gave me a good start however i made quite a few alterations to the recipe.",

What I did was substitute an equivicant amount of tropical fruit blend for the coconut walnuts and bananas and it was fantastic! 5-stars all the way! I've tried other combinations also fresh berries with a berry juice blend etc. The choices are only limited by your imagination. I've made it 3 or 4 times.",

I also used up bits and pieces of various milks in the refrigerator to make a total of 4 cups of liquid. I used evaporated milk reduced fat half and half and skim milk. I added the banana cut into cubes not sliced. I really wanted to mash it but I didn't. I added a dribble of both coconut extract and rum extract. It froze up beautifully and is now in the freezer. My taste of what I scraped out of the ice cream maker was very good.",
