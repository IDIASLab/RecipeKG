Even if you're making one tuna steak you must follow the full liquid measurement. The first time I got sweet and sour candied onions and tuna. Had to chip it off my plate. LOL! The second... success! The most difficult thing about this recipe is mustering the patience to caramelize the onions. Don't rush! Take your time; do it right. It makes all the difference. That and withstanding the pungent aroma of the red wine vinegar as you complete the recipe. I paired mine with steamed spinach. I was raised with spinach and vinegar (instead of butter salt etc.) so pouring a little sauce over my spinach was all I needed. With that it is a bit of a pungent overload so you might want to have a nice mellow starch in addition. Simple rice pilaf might do the trick. I'm so NOT a cook but I think I pulled this off with aplomb (the second time). Highly recommended.",
