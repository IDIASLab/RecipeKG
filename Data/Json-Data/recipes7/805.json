Oh, and I added some walnuts and chocolate chips.   Even with all those changes, the bars still had a cakey texture. Didn't taste like banana bread though!",

I replaced the artificial sweetener with 1/2 cup brown sugar. Instead of the 3/4 cup skim milk which, when doubling the recipe made it 1 1/2 cups, I used 3/4 cup 1 percent milk and 3/4 cup vegetable oil.  This made the bars less like cake  and more dense, like a bar cookie.  After frosting with cream cheese frosting, I felt it needed a little more bang, so I drizzled it with salted caramel sauce.  Everyone raved about them -- will definitely be making more!",

I topped with a vanilla glaze I had in the fridge, and bf liked them but thought that a strawberry frosting would be better with them.  I think some more spices, like cinnamon, would make the taste pop more too.  He preferred the chocolate cake I  made today, but well . . .it's chocolate, and he likes most things with chocolate better anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!",
