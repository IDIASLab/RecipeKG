I'm used to eating them fresh only, but I recently purchased some apricots that ripened very quickly. I wanted to make a jam or syrup out of them and couldn't find what I wanted, so I made something up. The result is a very sweet, thick syrup. Leave out the amaretto if you don't use it in cooking.",

I think each piece of fruit (or each harvest) is so different in sweetness and in liquid that it is very good to have this alternative for thickening this syrup. I didn't even cook mine as long as it called for. This will be perfect for adding to my breakfast oatmeal my Greek yogurt mixed with sour cream for my pancakes. And the list just goes on. Very nice! Thanks for the recipe pomplemousse!",
