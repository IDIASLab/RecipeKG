When each guest arrives they are given a real Churchill Downs commemorative mint julep glass to which they then add a self-stick name tag on which they print their name. This serves as their glass, name tag, and souvenir of the party. Many still have one from each year of the party as Churchill Downs produces a new one each year!!!",

When i put it together i used a 1.75 liter of Kentucky bourbon with the simple syrup mix. It was REALLY strong so I diluted it with 1-2 liters of club soda and 1 liter of water. A 10 lb bag of ice with the mixture in a cooler did the trick! It was delicious!",

I thought it was too sweet with that amount although the original 3 cups was not sweet enough. As you keep tasting it s hard to judge the sweetness - I thought I had it right then came back a few hours later to determine it was way too sweet. People said they enjoyed it but I had a lot leftover which I think speaks more than words. I found another recipe that has more exact measurements (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/damaris-phillips/mint-julep-party-pitcher-2387909) I m going to try that next time.",
