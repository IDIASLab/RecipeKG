I am obsessed with banana bread and so it my husband, and I am also obsessed with Lotus Cookie Butter! If you don't know what that is yet, I strongly suggest you become familiar because I am telling you, it is the best thing ever! There are lots of different types of cookie butters. However, I love Lotus because it has a caramel taste to it.",

I decided to throw it away in the morning. This morning I sat down to review it and then thought I should try it again. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! The flavors all melded and came together to produce a sweet moist bread. I made half the recipe and decreased the bananas to 2 rather than 3. I think the addition of nuts would compliment this bread. Good recipe.",
