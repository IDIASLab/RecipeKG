I removed the avocado used regular cream cheese(also couldn't find the jalapeno flavor) added half slices of tomato thin slices of red onion and used a variety of cheese. It was a HUGE hit with everyone. And is requested at the family 4th of July get together now.:D....PS. this is even great for young kids and creates very little mess when eating. Huge Plus in a family full of kids!",
