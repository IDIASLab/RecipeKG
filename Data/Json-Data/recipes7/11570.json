I recommend using English cukes  as recommended in the recipe, quarter as directed, but, remove the seeds (reduces the water).  We sweat the cukes then place in paper towels to fully dry, then pack in mason jars proportionally placing the appropriate amount of kimchi sauce in each jar ( we make a 4X batch each time). They  stay crisp for weeks. Great recipe!",
