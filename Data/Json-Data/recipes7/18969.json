A couple of people thought it could be a bit more moist although I didn't agree I thought it was perfect. Some thought it would be even better with a dollop of whipped cream. I used a mix of Granny Smith apples and Honey Crisp Apples and used Vietnamese cinnamon (my favorite). I will definitely make it again thanks for the recipe! I didn't have a big enough pan so I made two cakes with what I had and it worked out well.",

I will make it again but next time 3/4 C of olive oil & 3/4 C of applesauce in place of the remaining oil should correct the greasy mouth-feel & I will also cut the sugar again - 1 C in the topping 1/2 C in the cake batter. // I also used 1/4 C snipped prunes no raisins on hand & those taste great. I added 2 tsp of apple-cider vinegar to the topping to balance the sweet & that worked fine plus i used ONLY brown sugar in the topping & white in the cake. Overall it s tasty; a bit too oily a bit too sweet but good nonetheless.: ) I am sure it will all be eaten!",
