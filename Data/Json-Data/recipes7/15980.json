The results were picture perfect. Not bad for High school and Junior high kids. The only alteration we did was add more vanilla extract. I alway double my vanilla because I am crazy about the flavor. Give this a try, you really can\u2019t go wrong especially if you make the investment of a waffle cone iron for about $30 on Amazon. I don\u2019t feel its a wasted investment as you will use it time and again and can use it for crepes as well. Something we do a lot in our multicultural home.
