I did have way to much of the pumpkin filling easily could have doubled the cookie recipe and still had plenty of filling. I used a 1 1/2 inch cookie cutter there didn't seem to be enough dough to use 2 1/2 inch one. Oh and I didn't cut the faces out of them it sounds like way to much work. Overall the cookies tasted okay not to sweet. My five year old ate them up. She liked the \"pumpkin applesauce\" inside.",
