I don't think the added sugar is necessary especially if you use a very ripe banana but that is personal preference. As the recipe submitter said you don't taste the tofu AT ALL so this is a good way to sneak some in your diet. That said the servings sizes are very small. The whole recipe barely made 16oz which in my opinion is the perfect servings size for 1 person not 2. I will be making this again tomorrow for breakfast!",

Another reviewer described the consistency as fluffy and I totally agree with her. The strawberry flavor really came through the yogurt gave it just a little tang and the tofu made it incredibly creamy. Only one comment this makes 2 small smoothies so if you re used to drinking a larger smoothie you may want to consider doubling the recipe. Not only does this taste good it breaks down pretty well nutritionally too.",
