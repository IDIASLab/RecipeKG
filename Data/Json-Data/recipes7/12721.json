I adjusted the seasoning a bit as I was concerned about the amounts. \nI used 2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1 tsp white sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp salt free Cajun seasoning mix. I had a can of tomato sauce that was 680 ml and I used that for the water amount as well. I was able to omit the oil as I used a non stick sauce pan. I was able to make it in a hour exactly as the shredded cabbage in the bag is fine and cooks fast. I served over rice as I make my cabbage rolls with rice and meat. \nNext time I would definitely double the recipe as we ate it in one sitting, I am feeding two growing boys! Thanks for a great new recipe :)",

It was delicious, and the cabbage was nice and tender, but it didn\u2019t taste like cabbage rolls... until we added more sugar. Then the cabbage roll flavor magically appeared.
