I was pleasantly surprised at how good this combination of ingredients was never guessing that garbanzo beans / chick peas would be so good roasted. I microwaved the butternut squash for 2 minutes after puncturing with a fork a few times just to make it a bit more tender and easier to peel and chop. I am so glad this was the featured recipe today because it was great:)",
