Mine made a thin golden-brown meringue layer on the top and did not take anywhere near the whole hour to bake. I made butter-flaky crust from this site and made only half the crust recipe to achieve a thin bottom crust. I also \"marinated\" my pears in some lemon juice after they were sliced while I prepared everything else which kept them from turning too brown and added a little flavor as well.
