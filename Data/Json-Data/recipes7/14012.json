And I had some fresh blueberries in the fridge so I dusted them with flour and added them to a dozen of the mini muffins. And finally I did substitute the sugar with Truvia Baking Blend. This is as good as any banana bread I ve ever made and I can see these disappearing quickly on a brunch table (well any table really). The muffins were perfectly baked at 13 minutes they're tender moist and loaded with banana flavor. cathy thanks for sharing your recipe it s a winner in this house.",
