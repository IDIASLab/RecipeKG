I doubled the bacon cooked and diced it before putting it in the crockpot. I cut the black pepper to a TEASPOON and half and still felt the bite. Next time I will only use a teaspoon. I added a sprinkling of parsley flakes and about a 1/2 cup more chicken broth than the recipe calls for. This was delicious and everyone in my family ate it without issues. I have 4 kids so that's a victory at dinner in my home.",

At the end of cooking it I tasted it and it was good but something was missing.... Potatos! So I diced up three medium potatots cooked them up and added them to the soup before I served.

I use 2 bags of frozen corn Flavor Pac brand I think the Sweet Candy Corn and the Sweet Yellow are the two I think and I do still add the sugar. I use 2 cans chicken broth omit the pepper or just give it a light sprinkle omit the celery and omit the bacon unless we just sprinkle it over each bowl before serving. To assemble I dice up 2 potatoes half an onion add the corn and the chicken broth to a big pot on the stovetop and cook until the potatoes and corn are soft 15-20 minutes; then add the cheeses and stir constantly until all melted. Then I remove the pot from the stove and add 1 can of evaporated milk--careful here or it will curdle--still taste ok but look not so good... Almost forgot the most important ingredient to my changes--I add 2 heaping tablespoons of chopped jalapeno pepper from a jar with some of the juice while the potatoes are cooking. This soup is fabulous as written but even better I think with my changes--wish I could give it more stars!",
