When you crush the cells in a vegetable, as opposed to cutting cleanly through them, certain compounds get mixed together, which can result in a significantly different flavor.\u00a0In cucumbers this is a good thing--onions, not so much. But this salad is one of my all-time favorite cold summer side dishes. The only decision you're going to have to make is how long to let the cucumbers marinate--half an hour or so or not at all.",

And have always enjoyed them ... so I decided to try this one.  I followed the recipe as is ... I did not have anything but my hammer fist to beat the cucumbers (which came wrapped in plastic from the store).  After beating them ... I rinsed them off and followed the rest of the recipe.  I did not know how much crushed pepper to use so I used 1-teaspoon ... which was just right (for me).  This dish was awesome!!!  Thank you Chef John!!!  I will save this and share this recipe with everyone ... kudos!",
