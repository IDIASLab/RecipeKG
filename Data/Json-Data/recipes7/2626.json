I tried this recipe and followed the instructions (didn't use almonds in the dough as we didn't have any chopped ones on hand) and it came out wonderfully. The sugar syrup was too sweet for me but the harisseh was tasty even without it. I will definitely be making this again!",

In the text of the recipe note that you should mix 1/2 C sugar to the flour mixture not 2 cups. I omitted pouring the syrup over the cookies since I wanted them crispier and not so sweet. I used a 12x8 teflon baking pan so they would be thinner & crispier. Also I didn't blanch the almonds since I was short on time and they turned out fine. I served these cookies with peeled sliced oranges (cut in 1/2\" rings) sprinkled with cinnamon. The rose water was subtle and added a unique flavor.",
