Added an egg and some panko breadcrumbs to the meatball ingredients and left out the corn starch from the meatballs. Instead I used the cornstarch at the end of the cooking in the water and soy sauce etc, to thicken the sauce a little. In addition I added some marsala. So Japan-meets-Italy. Served it over some fresh soba noodles with sauteed asparagus. It was a hit! Will def make a gain.",

The teriyaki sauce was also flavourless and thin. Next time I'm making teriyaki chicken with proper chicken breasts not mince and will have to find a different recipe for the sauce. The teriyaki sauce as I know it in the Japanese restaurants I've been to is very thick sweet and flavoursome. Probably has quite a bit of cornstarch in it to get it to a nice and thick consistency.",
