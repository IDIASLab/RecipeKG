Grabbed what I saw, stirred up a bowl, and gave it a cheeky title based on some of the cute terms my daughter uses for food. I used lite mayo and Splenda, and I'm sure it would be great with full-fat mayo and sugar. Saved the other half-can of garbanzos for tossing with a salad. I also used half fresh, half frozen broccoli (as that's what I had on hand), and it was all tasty.",

I changed ingredients up a bit - for the dressing used 2 tbsp cider vinegar and 2 tbsp mayo with 1 tsp table sugar and a few drops of liquid stevia. I grated the carrot and used fresh broccoli blanched in the microwave. I was not inspired to use any kind of herb or spice so I didn't doctor it at all in that way using only salt and pepper. The non-spiced flavors of all the ingredients were good but it was missing something. Maybe Rock_Lobster or someone else will try it and offer suggestions? Maybe I'll be inspired myself when I have the rest for lunch today! Thanks for the recipe to try.",
