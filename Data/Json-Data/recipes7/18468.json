After doing a little research on this Italian cake it sounds like that is how it's supposed to be. It is just too dry for my liking so I ended up crumbling the rest of the cake and putting it in a plastic container and in the freezer to use as an ice cream topping. It would be good crumbled over fruit as well. The flavor is really nice but it is just too dry to eat on it's own in my opinion.",
