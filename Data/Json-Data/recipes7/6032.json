I had to use the milk and vinegar substitute for the buttermilk because I forgot to bring my list to the store and of course forgot the buttermilk :( It worked fine. I used butter in both the cake and the frosting since I never have margarine. I also made some chocolate frosting for the sides of the cake, I didn't have enough of the coconut frosting but I think that is because I'm a little heavy handed with frosting. My family was sad when this cake was gone and there was a fight over the last piece ( I won! ) Thanks for the great recipe, its a keeper.",

I agree w/ other reviewers who say it is not chocolate enough. The one inside the candy bar's pkg tastes more chocolately, more than likely because they use 1/2 c less flour. They have you melt the chocolate in the butter instead of water (water dilutes, butter enhances). So there is a not the dilution of the water in the cake. Also in the pkg directions you don't have to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites stiff, just add the eggs. Candy bar's recipe tastes better and is less work.\n(To be honest, this is so close to the candy bar recipe it seems like a lightly modified knock-off.)They make it into cupcakes but just use cake pans instead. The frosting recipe is the same as this one too. I also agree that you have to do the frosting plus 1/2 to barely have enough to do a cake. The candy bar's package gives you more frosting for it does it as 1.5 of this recipe.",

As did everyone else. It was super light, fluffy and moist (don't overcook it even a little). I made 36 cupcakes and they were amazing. You do need to cook the frosting and stir for 10-12 minutes, but I thickened it too much because as it cooled it got much to thick especially after adding the nuts and coconut flakes. To correct for this just add SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK and a little real milk until it brings it to the consistency you can spread. I would suggest when you are heating the sauce for the frosting you should stop cooking it whenever you notice it no longer falls immediately back into place when you move your spoon through the sauce. This will be close to 9-12 minutes depending on your stove. Remember, as it cools it will get even firmer. Other than my learning curve, this recipe is an ABSOLUTE WIN and I am using it anytime I need German chocolate cake!",

I wanted my frosting to cover it entirely so ended up with little bare spots around the edges that I filled in with chocolate frosting (\"Creamy Chocolate Frosting\" by Tracy on this website). The frosting is only meant to cover the top and in between layers so make more if you want it to be more rich and/or have more full coverage....I've since made this again as cupcakes! I've posted a picture of them. I followed the recipe to a 't'. Did not make any modifications and again received RAVE reviews! People went out of their way to tell me how great they were....To make them into cupcakes I filled the paper cake cups to about 2/3-3/4 full and baked at 350 for about 18 minutes. You know they are ready when the tops look porous like sponges and the edges get just a little bit brown. Also use a toothpick:) I was able to make 24 cupcakes out of this recipe and the coconut frosting was the perfect amount for them. I used my same chocolate frosting to fill in around the edges.",

I'm not a very experienced baker so was a bit worried but followed the instructions to the letter and it came out perfect:) Just a note: the picture contains butter icing not in the recipe on the sides. Budget a bit of exra marge icing sugar and cocoa for that:)",
