I am just a little confused about the number of servings because the only Grands I could find in my market had 8 biscuits in it.  We made only half the recipe, so I'm not sure where 12 puffs comes from.  I would caution you to be sure to make sure every little seam is tightly closed!  If you see my photo, you'll know what happens if there is a little hole.  I chose to eat part of one from which the marshmallow had escaped, and it was still yummy.  I had a little butter left, so you could even go a tablespoon or two short with the melted butter (you can always melt a little more!), and I used maybe a little more of the cinnamon sugar (I would suggest spooning it over the rolls because otherwise it gets all gummy from the butter).  I would maybe even try the next time they want some of this to cut each biscuit in half horizontally to make a smaller roll.  You could put almost anything in the middle with marshmallows---I'm thinking caramel or chocolate.  Anyway, this was successful!  I was glad to have the little girls take them away so I don't even have to think about having one with all the marshmallow in it.  They were delighted!  Thanks for the recipe!",
