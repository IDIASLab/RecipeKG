I like capers and typically have them on hand but was certain that Mickey D's would NOT use capers and this would not taste anything like their sauce. WRONG! Spot on! No, BETTER! The recipe submitter mentioned it turning out a little too runny and my solution to that was really smashing the relish against the jar before adding it to the recipe to eliminate some of the excess liquid. Hands down this is the best tartar sauce EVER and I am thrilled to be the first reviewer. I will make this often with my catfish. Thanks duboo!",

The flavor is delicious and can only get better the longer it's refrigerated. The texture couldn't be better. There was no need to thicken or thin. I've never had the tartar sauce from McDonald's. All I can say after trying this is \"Look out McDonald's duboo's in town!\" Thanks for sharing duboo. I will use this recipe many times.",

This being the Lenten season, fish is on the Friday menu now, so I thought I'd give this copycat recipe a try.  I made it with no adjustments, except to skip the last step of adding part of the relish and onions unblended.  I used my immersion hand blender and thought the consistency of the sauce was nice and creamy - not the least bit runny.  The addition of capers was a nice touch.  We liked this very much.",
