Now during the baking process much of the pie filling is oozing out and spilling over the edges of the crust. The only change I made to the recipe was using what one reviewer suggested - browned butter instead of corn oil. I will come back later and review for taste. But I knew when I saw the ingredients it was probably not going to fit into a 9 inch deep dish pie shell. Also the other reviewers here (at least 2) did not state they followed the recipe here... only comments like \"I've used this recipe for years\" - the exact one? And \"yummy give me another piece\" - did they fix it as directed or just looking at the picture? As I said I will come back later and rate for taste but based on what's oozing over the edges I should have discarded even more filling than I did to adjust to the deep dish pastry shell.",

I also used 60% cacao chips instead of semisweet. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. I agree that there is way too much filling - I ended up making two muffin-sized pies in addition to the main one. It was actually great because I was able to taste what I made without cutting into the actual pie prematurely. The pie turned out really well! It had a crust that resembled a cookie and was gooey inside as I expected. The one thing I would change would be to melt the chocolate chips and mix it in after the sugars or something. My chocolate chips all sank to the bottom of the pie. Super tasty still but a little crunchy. I would like the flavor and texture to be better balanced throughout the whole pie. It is a recipe I will keep! I did receive several compliments on it this year!",
