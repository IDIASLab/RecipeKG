Instead of sugar I used 2 Tbsp of molasses and a quarter cup of honey. I also added a quarter cup of whole wheat flour to the filling as well as 2 small eggs. I ended up having to bake it for 40 minutes total but it turned out great. My 4 year old asked for more pumplin pie with ice cream!",

(We used the school kitchen and I substitute other plain cookies for the graham crackers which we do not have in Japan.) However I agree with the other review that said the crust is too dry. I have made this pie three times now over the past few years and although the crust eventually turns out fine it's not a very good dough if you follow the recipe exactly. We usually end up adding more milk but there must be another way!",
