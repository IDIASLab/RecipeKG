We tweaked the \u2018made recipe as written\u2019 by subbing 1 tbsp Stevia in the Raw for the sugar and used fresh Italian parsley (probably closer to a tablespoon than a teaspoon). The 2nd version took the \u2018made recipe as written\u2019 and added about 1/8 teaspoon curry powder and 1/8 heaping teaspoon cayenne pepper powder. We felt the version with curry and cayenne took an already outstanding crab salad to an even higher level. While this was not tried, you might be able to cut the Hellmann\u2019s mayo to 1/4 cup without sacrificing any taste while eliminating some fat. Rather than use crackers, we had this for lunch. We laid 3-4 romaine lettuce leaves on a 10 inch flour tortilla, spooned on the crab salad, and then wrapped them. Makes for a quick and easy lunch!! A really great recipe, Mel . . . and yes, we didn\u2019t make enough.",

From the start, I substituted Old Bay for the sugar - there's enough sweetness in the crab already - and it worked out great.  I use equal amounts of light mayo, fat free sour cream, and light ranch, just enough to coat the crab, not gloopy.  I also use a ton more celery and parsley and add some finely chopped green onion.  \n\nDon't skimp on the fresh parsley!!!  When you first taste it, you should think \"Wow, I added way too much parsley.\"  If you don't, add more.  As it sits overnight, the flavors combine and the parsley really makes the crab flavors pop, and balances out the green onion in a beautiful way.\n\nI struggled a bit at first with getting the crab to the right size.  I tried chopping it, then tearing it by hand, and finally tried a potato masher, and this makes it so simple!  Now, I just dump the crab in the bottom, throw the rest of the ingredients on top, then mash it to break up the crab, while thoroughly combining all the other ingredients.  So easy and delicious!",

The next time I made a few changes based on other reviews and a few of my own and somehow it was even better! I scaled the mayo back to 1/4 cup (used Hellman's light) and also added about 1/8 cup of light sour cream. I used about 2 tsp of parsley and 3/4 cup celery. I added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and about 1/8 cup shredded mild cheddar cheese. The sour cream subdued the mayo flavor a bit which I prefer. The cayenne and small amount of cheese gave it a nice little kick. Follow the recipe to a T or make some small tweaks to suit your tastes like I did either way its delicious!!",

Quickly found out that I did not have the patience to pull the flakes apart so I stacked the layers and sliced diagonal strips with a sharp knife and set aside. I mixed all the other ingredients in small mixing bowl. Used Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing as that is my favorite ranch dressing. I also add sour cream for additional creaminess. I diced the celery as small as possible by hand as I love the flavor and coloring but did not want it to overpower the texture and flavor of the salad. I stacked the celery stalks 4 at a time cut it into thin strips and then another thin cut across about 4 inches at a time down the entire stalk. All ingredients were in proportion to the 5 lbs. of crab. Due to the amount of salad I was making I layered first the crab and then the creamy dressing in a large mixing bowl mixing after each layer. Refrigerated overnight. Flavorful and an excellent choice for one of my three contributions to the family get together for Christmas Day Dinner.",
