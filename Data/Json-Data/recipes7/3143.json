I also made it without mushrooms since I was out (the second time) and did not miss them. I sprinkiled the herbs on the top just before baking",

I also minused the mushrooms all together. When I layered it I salted and peppered and put havarti cheese between each layer. It turned out really good and had a nice flavor. I also left the thyme leaves in the cream mixture. It is an easy recipe to play around with.",

It doesn t tell you to insert a steamer insert/basket in the pan but instructs you to put the veggies in the pot cover with 1 of water bring to a boil and steam. Basically what you re doing is parboiling the veggies. It tells you to bake uncovered for about 40 minutes then uncover for the last 20 minutes...maybe a typo??? So here s what I did. First I sliced (not cubed) the butternut squash 1/4 thick and cut the slices in half the same as the other veggies for uniform cooking. I baked the casserole covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 20 minutes. As other reviewers have commented I felt the blue cheese dominated the flavor and I d reduce that by at least half or leave it out completely (and I love blue cheese) and double or more the gruyere (now that cheese was good on this!). The turnips butternut squash carrots and the leek all work harmoniously however I felt the mushrooms didn t belong in this gratin they didn t even look appealing after baking and I'd eliminate them. This was OK but not as tasty as I d hoped so a bit of a disappointment.",
