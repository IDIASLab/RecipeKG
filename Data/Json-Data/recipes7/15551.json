Not too much or out of place for the sweetness of the fruit.  I didn't change a thing except that I used fresh blackberries instead of frozen.  I can't wait until this evening when I get home to use the remaining glaze on some cold ham sandwiches with the little dinner rolls that I have leftover!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I think it may have even more uses than just a glaze for ham, I'll have to think on that for awhile.  The only thing to consider if you make this is to be careful not to splash it, as blackberry will not come out of anything you get it on, this coming from one clumsy cook!",
