I will do things a little differently next time.  I didn't have an 8\" springform but rather a 9\", and I think that would make a difference because it came out quite thin.  In fact, I could almost see it in a smaller pan.  I love those cookies used in the crust part!  I rolled them in a baggie with my rolling pin, but I think I left the crumbs too big.  I also think that next time I will try baking the crust for about 10 minutes on a low temperature so it forms a sturdier crust.  I used Trader Joe's lemon curd.  I loved the use of the mascarpone, and the blueberries weren't too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a great combination!  EDIT:  This time I used a 4x8 dish and baked the crust for 7 minutes at 350.  For the filling I made Perfect Lemon Curd (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/perfect-lemon-curd/) but added 1/2 cup to the mascarpone.  I forgot to buy the frozen whipped topping, so I used someone else's suggestion of using whipping cream--1 cup with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar added.  It was perfect!  And it was a hit with everyone!  So thanks once again, dana!",

I used Safeway Brand (Select) Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins in place of TJ's Tea Cookies. The bag was 5 ounces. The recipe calls for 4 1/2 ounces so I ate the other half ounce. Those little cookie thins are yummy! I didn't make my own Lemon Curd. I bought Safeway Select Lemon Curd in the jar. I picked the Blueberries the morning I made the Tart and they were just bursting with flavor. Made for my Book Club the gals gobbled down every single bite and I had none left to bring home to hubby. I will be making this recipe many more times in the future. Thanks Dana for a real Blueberry keeper!",

It tastes good even if you don't let it set in the fridge since mascarpone is pretty firm. I made my own whipped cream with 1 cups heavy cream 1/4 pod vanilla bean and 1 1/2 tsp powdered sugar. Whisk whisk whisk. Came out perfect. Must try if you love creamy desserts or blueberries.",
