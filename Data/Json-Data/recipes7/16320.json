        "description": "Hands down, sourdough is my favorite bread to eat. Something about it just gets my saliva flowing, and I will eat copious amounts of it. So much so that I like it with pretty much anything, including sandwiches and hamburgers. This is a recipe for making all-organic sourdough rolls if you want to add it to pretty much every kind of meal. This recipe demands some time (for the sourdough starter), but makes up for it with deliciousness. All products used in the initial recipe were organic. You can also use conventional goods if organic isn't your thing.",
