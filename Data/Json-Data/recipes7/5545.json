I took out 1 star for frosting because I didn't like its tangy taste. But this was the first time I had ever tasted cream cheese frosting.So it might just be me. So I added a little bit of melted chocolate and some more sugar to the frosting to make it more sweet. Also a TIP for adding bananas. Layer them just before you eat. Also don't leave the cake outside for long. Otherwise the bananas leave water and the layers will slide. Mine did the same thing. And I kind of didn't like the flavor of the softened bananas. Next time I think I ll add the banana cut up fresh while serving. But overall a very good tasting cake. Thanks Bakerbee and Aunt Lu:D",

Moist, soft and fluffy, milk chocolate in color.   I had nothing against the frosting - it's just that I had a request from the recipients for something deeply chocolate, which I accommodated with the more robustly chocolate \"Best Chocolate Frosting,\" also from this site.  It was the perfect choice for these cupcakes, a bold counterpoint for the milder cake.    One half recipe yielded one dozen cupcakes, which I baked 20-22 minutes.  Great recipe, but not as good with the  directions, so here goes:  sift the dry ingredients together and set aside.  Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then the vanilla.  Add the bananas. Add the flour mixture in three additions, alternately with the buttermilk , beginning and ending with the flour.  Done.",
