You shouldn't have to read about the chocolate part in the footnotes. It's listed as a peanut butter \"chocolate\" cheesecake. Also the melted chocolate did not mix in nicely. It left the cream cheese mixture speckled looked nothing like the nice dark chocolate in the picture. I'm wondering if a semi-sweet Cocoa powder would work better? Although the taste was there I only gave it 3 stars because of the way the recipe is laid out and also how the chocolate did not mix well.",

I ended up making a fluffy peanut butter icing to put on top and it worked much better. I would suggest making the cheesecake but using a different topping",

                "reviewBody": "Very tasty. It s basically a chocolate cheesecake on top of a crisp peanut butter cookie. I did have some issues baking the crust. Maybe it was my cheap apartment oven or my dark springform pan but my first try at the crust was burnt on the edges and too brown dry and crunchy in the middle. I mixed up another batch of the dough and reduced the baking time by 10 minutes (!!!) and it came out better but still a little browner than I d like on the edges. My advice is to watch it like a hawk. I might try an actual peanut butter cookie recipe for the crust next time. It was good but not spectacular. The cheesecake was delicious-chocolatey without overpowering the cheesecake flavor. I ve never see bricks of chocolate cream cheese so I mixed in melted Baker s chocolate. Mine blended perfectly but I m sure my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer has more to do with than than me. I didn t make the whipped topping instead opting for chopped mini Reese s cups. Final thoughts on the cheesecake as a whole: I think a little more peanut butter flavor would make it better so next time I ll look into finding a peanut butter sauce recipe to drizzle over the top. Also I d recommend making this (or any cheesecake really) at least a day before you plan to eat it. Something about letting it set and chill longer seems to make it richer. Happy eating!",
