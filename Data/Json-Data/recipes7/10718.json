I was given the recipe by a doctor in the state of Washington so don't agree with the title Mormon Muffins. None the less they are yummy and great source of fiber. I even bake the whole recipe sometimes then freeze them. They freeze well. I don't put nuts in mine as don't care for nuts in my baked goods. I also add some vanilla to mine",

Think the acidic buttermilk keeps it fresh even with eggs in the batter. These days I try and use it up in four weeks. Never had a problem with food safety with fresh eggs. Don't put fruit dried or fresh in batter until baking.",
