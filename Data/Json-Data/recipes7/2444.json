Used fresh ginger instead of powdered and added rice vinegar (a good tablespoon or so) and a dash of sesame oil. WOW!! What a great dressing!! Used it on fresh spinach and it was perfect!! The flavors are identical to the restaurant type but since its mayo based, stays creamy. This will definitely be one of my \"go to\" dressings!!",
