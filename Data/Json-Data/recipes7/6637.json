Added sliced red bell pepper for color and some leftover shredded grilled chicken breast. I didn t have any ramen noodles so I used chow mein noodles instead and would use them again. Served with toasted baguette with a yummy compound butter that I d mixed up early in the day. The dressing had just the right amount of sweetness and is mellow in taste. This was an absolutely delicious salad which will be made often in this house. Thanks Cookmaster thoroughly enjoyed your recipe.",
