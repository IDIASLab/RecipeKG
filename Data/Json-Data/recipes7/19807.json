I used a cookie scoop and tossed them in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Once coated I was able to roll them into balls. Took exactly 11 minutes for the perfectly round cookies to bake. Extremely sweet, chewy, super soft and rather sticky. One of my grandsons tried them and he absolutely loved them! In his words 'These are the bomb'. I thought they were just ok. I rated them 3 stars and my grandson rated them 5 stars, hence the 4 Star rating.",

To make the cookie dough balls.. I lightly floured my hands AND a sheet of waxed paper--made a long roll out of the dough and cut it into same sized pieces with a floured knife.. Again (with lightly floured hands) I rolled each piece into a ball....half the balls were rolled in the sugar cinnamon mixture.. and.. For a slightly different look and taste....the other half were rolled in what was left of the remaining sugar cinnamon mixture plus 1/4 cup of crushed honey roasted almonds.. Both are equally delicious.. Thx for sharing",

These cookies were okay. They were very mild flavored. I like my cookies pretty crisp and probably should have baked them a couple of minutes longer. WORD OF WARNING: Refrigerate the dough for at least 30-45 minutes or it will be too sticky to work with. I made my dough in a metal bowl refrigerated it for 20 minutes and the only workable dough was that that touched the cold metal bowl. If you like very mild cookies you will like these. I was hoping for a stronger honey and/or cinnamon flavor; I did roll them in cinnamon sugar.",
