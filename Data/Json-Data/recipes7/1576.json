I only made two changes (due to a lack of ingredients on hand): I left out the olives (don't like them anyway) and substituted chopped cashews for the pine nuts. My husband thought it was too sweet and suggested that next time we use double the tomatoes and half the raisins. I really like the sweetness of the raisins though so I guess it depends on how sweet you like your sauce. I also cut the chicken into strips before I cooked it just because the pieces I had were really large and it came out just fine. I will do this again with some sort of compromise between the raisins and tomatoes so that my husband doesn't have a little pile of raisins on the side of his plate by the time dinner is over. This would be a great dish to serve for a dinner party and you could easily make the sauce in advance even the night before which is what I think I'll do next time.",
