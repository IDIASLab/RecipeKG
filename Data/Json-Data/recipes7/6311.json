I reduced the amaretto upon reading the other reviews. I just did a couple spoonfuls. Probably more of a flavoring than a mixed drink. I probably doubled the strawberries and vanilla extract too. The strawberries were frozen and hard to precisely measure. Either way this does oddly taste like a strawberry shortcake. I bought a tiny bottle of amaretto which I have never knowingly tasted and found it to be delicious. TY",
