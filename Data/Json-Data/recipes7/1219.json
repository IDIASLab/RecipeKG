It turned out quite interesting...very smooth with a consistency denser than pumpkin pie but not really gelatin-like either. Not horrible but obviously not the way it was suppose to turn out. -- SECOND TRY -- I used fat free cream cheese and added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. It turned out alright - a little dense but I did change the recipe. It was somewhat like a sponge cake but not quite as fluffy. -- THIRD TRY -- Third time's a charm! I used fat-free cream cheese along with fat free skim milk. Although it looked dense it turned out soft. It was flufflier this time probably because I did a better job of combining the ingredients (making sure the yolks and sugar were light and fluffy etc.). I didn't have parchment paper so I just used PAM and I had no problem with it sticking. With the fat-free ingredients each serving has barely any fat and less than 100 calories!",

I halved the recipe to make a small cheesecake and added a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice. It turned out wonderfully! Just like the japanese cheesecakes from asian bakeries. Light like a spongecake (as i think it should be) yet still delicious and easy to make.",

Hence, I would have to give this recipe a low rating bc it is more of like a sponge - egg cake, that always sinks.

One cake I did in a toaster oven two in my large convection oven. Strangely enough the toaster oven came out best in terms of looks. The lower cake in the convection oven got water condensation droplets falling on it ruining its looks. Both in the large oven didn't brown as nicely and I added 10 min. each in toaster oven to get the golden coloring. They didn't dry out; I suppose due to the water bath. All had wonderful flavor and texture. I think it'll look better if I made two cakes from this triple recipe. I had to stack the slices. See my photos submitted on 3/20/07",
