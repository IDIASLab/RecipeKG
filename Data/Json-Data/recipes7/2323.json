Thanks for posting the original recipe -- it was a great starting point!!!!\n\nI used half all-purpose flour and half high-altitude whole wheat flour (I tried all whole wheat earlier and they were too dense) \nadded a little more cinnamon, plus 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\nUsed a little less sugar \nI replaced the oil with nearly a cup of applesauce\nI added about 1/4 cup of golden raisins \n\nI used muffin liners and sprayed them with non-stick spray. I had to cook the muffins about 25 minutes (I don't know if it's because of the altitude 6,000+ or because of applesauce). \n\nI used one batch of frosting to do nearly two dozen muffins (don't like it too sweet).\n\n\n",

(i made 'em 'cause i had to stop my mom from buying a pack of four from the store & was buying carrots anyway(she really likes stuff w/ carrots in 'em).(i like to bake alot) ya sure the pack of four at the store has 4 bigger ones but this recipe made 12 smaller ones-amount totally makes up for size. i even was able to use my dessert decorator to use to put the icing on them-quite a bit of fun using that thing. i was kinda worried that the icing would be too thick but luckily it came out fairly nice(out of the decorator). i will SOOO make these again!!!!

I have small-ish cupcake pans perfect for typical cupcake liners and this recipe made 18. I'm glad I didn't double the recipe. I did add 1C chopped walnuts with the carrots and the batter handled it just fine. The only way to improve this would be a little stronger on the spice(s) if you like them spicier. Our family of 3 is quite pleased. I'm holding onto the recipe and will use this anytime we want carrot muffins. Not heavy at all but not too light either. Also I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 20 minutes in a weak gas oven.... no problems with the directions. Beautiful.",
