Definitely make this a day ahead of time to let the flavor improve!!\nI do not have a blender, so I used a hand mixer, which I do NOT recommend if you're sharing this with others, simply because of the lack of visual appeal (it looked completely disgusting with beige chunks). I'm not vegan, and I do think regular pumpkin pie is better. I still might make this again, though, since it's so healthy and simple.",

(except for my mother - I made the recipe for her)  No one else questioned that it tasted \"different\". However, the reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is because 1) both my mother & I thought it needed more of a real \"pumpkin\" flavor and 2)everyone noticed that the clove taste was a little strong. I think the next time I make it I'll use pumpkin pie spice instead and maybe a little extra pumpkin as well. Otherwise, I would absolutely recommend it to serve to anyone who can't have dairy. I'll be making it again.",
