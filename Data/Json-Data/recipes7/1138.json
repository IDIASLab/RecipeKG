I replaced the white flour with Whole wheat pastry flour,Milk for skim milk,Splenda for the sugar & used egg beater's in place of the egg's.replaced applesauce(homade-no sugar with cinnamon) for the oil in the batter,Added 1 Tsp cinnamon to the batter.I grated 2 large honey crisp apple's (skins on) into the batter.Put the cinnamon/splenda mixture in a brown bag, placed the fritters in the bag & shook to coat.I also used my small cookie dough scoop to put them into the hot oil.Worked perfectly!They poofed out very well.A very nice size to handle for adult's & kid's.Very quick and super easy!Slightly crisp on the outside,moist,tender and fluffy on the inside.Great morning treat while we went on our Autumn walk!Great with Coffee!My kid's loved them.No leftover's,Alway a bonus! I will be making these again! I am thinking of trying pumpkin next time!YUM!!Thanks for a great recipe :)",

I dusted half of the batch with powdered sugar, but I prefer them dusted with cinnamon and sugar. It's a good idea to drop small spoonfuls of the batter into the oil because the fritters will expand, and they will retain too much oil (and will be soggy) if they're too big.",

Drop by tablespoon or even teaspoon, depending on how large you want them. They puff up quite a bit. Do NOT make them too large or the center will still be raw. I also found that 375 was a bit too warm, I cooked them @ 350. They came out amazingly, way better than the fair! You actually get little pieces of apple in every bite! They were wicked easy to make! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  These will be a treat for my family for a long time.",
