I added a tbsp of lemon juice and used the inside of two small vanilla beans (bulk barn style) in place of vanilla extract and a couple drops of lemon flavouring. The lemon juice cuts down the \"goat\" flavour. Without lemon juice you can still taste the \"goat\". Excellent recipe overall and two thumbs up to MATHGOD for trying it in the first place.",

I didn't tell anyone it was goat cheese before they ate it and they could tell a slight difference but it was good different. My boyfriend is allergic to a lot of foods. Not epi-pen allergic but very sensitive to many: soy dairy eggs peanut butter gluten and corn. He likes goat cheese and uses it a lot so I thought I'd try a goat cheese cheesecake because he loves cheesecake. I found this recipe and it turned out perfect! I did have to modify it but it still worked out great. I used duck eggs instead of eggs and used a almond meal crust with coconut butter vanilla and organic coconut sugar in place of regular sugar. We try to cut back on the sugar. I also used light coconut milk. I made the compote with frozen berries and served with fresh as well. I could never make anything like this without a recipe and thank you for making yours availble!",
