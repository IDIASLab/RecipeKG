The honey created lots of \"juice\" for the fruit. The bananas did go a bit soggy after a few hours, but not as fast as they would have without the citrus. Pineapple or mango would work great as well. As long as the fruit is light enough in color, it makes a great contrast for the berries. This is also great served over pound cake, shortcake, angel food cake, etc, and topped with whipped cream. Yum!!",
