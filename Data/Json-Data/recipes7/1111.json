Recommended Alterations:  Reverse the measurements for oil and balsamic vinegar and cut back on the sugar a bit (be sure to use olive oil and a good quality balsamic vinegar).  ADD 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (pairs well with the greens and fruit).  Use RED onion, it's a better tasting onion when raw.  Although I halved the recipe I still used 1/2 pound strawberries and 1 mango - so if you make the full batch I would recommend at least 1 pound strawberries and 2 mangoes.  I plan to make this often for the summer and bring to potlucks too!  Absolutely delicious!",

I toasted the almonds which brought out an awesome flavor. I used about 3/4 of a pound of strawberries instead of just 1/2 a pound. I used two bags of salad (greener selection & romaine). Next time I would decrease the oil and increase the balsamic vinegar. This was a huge hit. It might be good with a little bit of chopped cilantro or basil?",
