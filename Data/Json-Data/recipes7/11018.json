I added dried cranberries and golden raisins this time in place of nuts; it was indeed a lot like a fruitcake but much better! The frosting was a perfect complement. Don't be put off with how wet the batter is, I followed the cooling directions which yielded an amazing cake. Kudos to its creator!",

Other than skipping the salt in the frosting as Christina recommended I followed all other directions to the letter. If you happen to forget to add that tablespoon of reserved pineapple juice to the frosting don't stress. I really didn't find the flavor much different than a standard cream cheese frosting. This is a dense moist carrot cake that's absolutely full of flavor.",
