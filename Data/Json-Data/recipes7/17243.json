I am not vegan but this recipe is the best I have used for avoiding egg and dairy (for allergy purposes). I serve these cookies all the time to non-vegans and they are always a huge hit. The key is to not over bake! Please note, each individual ingredient is not necessarily certified vegan. Decorate as you wish with your preferred cookie icing.",
