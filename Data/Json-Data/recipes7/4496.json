I did not have cardamom which I somehow ran out of so I omitted it. I used one large Tbls of rose syrup as I was afraid it would be too sweet. I used a small pinch of saffron and I finely chopped the roasted and salted pistachios (from a package) thinking a bit of salt would enhance flavor before adding into the softened ice cream. It is now sitting in a souffl\u00e9 dish in the freezer. I tasted it after it was all mixed together and I am glad I cutback on the rose syrup. I think the next time I'll use a full pinch of saffron and the cardomom for sure. I imagine I'll need to dry out the rose petals first and will add them tomorrow with a light dusting of pistachios on the ice cream. Maybe a 5 star but since I've not tasted it frozen it'll be 4 for now. Very pretty with very little effort.",
