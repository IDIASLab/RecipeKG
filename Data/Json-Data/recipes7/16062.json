I also decreased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp but kept the same re all other spices. These sat  longer in the fridge than anticipated (1 1/2 days) but came out so tender and moist! When Hubby barbecued, he added our favorite bbq sauce to them and they were amazing: spicy, juicy and extremely flavorful.  Wow...looking forward to our next barbecue!",

After marinating for five hours(wrapped) I grilled it at 375 closed for twelve minutes then transferred it to a 375 preheated oven for an additional fifteen. Flavor is excellent but chargrilled would definitely yield a better flavor!",

I only did a couple of things differently: I used a teaspoon each of salt and red pepper flakes instead of the tablespoon of each that was called for. And I added garlic powder to the marinade probably 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. Yum. Definitely a do-again!",
