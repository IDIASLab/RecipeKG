The flavor of this salad is mellow/mild so don't forget that little splash of rice vinegar just before serving as I think it's important to the overall taste of this recipe. The recipe calls for hot chile peppers so I used red pepper flakes and will increase the amount in the future. Although not by most people's calendar it's already summer in Florida has been for a while and this will be a perfect main course summer salad served over a bed of crisp salad greens. Thanks for sharing.",
