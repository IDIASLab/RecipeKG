I can't believe I liked it so well because I'm not fond of crescent rolls in desserts that well. I used a glass 9x13 pan and just put the rolls in and spread them out.  I spent just a few seconds to make sure the seams were together and the edges were not to thick. Then I poured the cream cheese mixture on top and spread it around.  Adding the second layer of rolls was a teeny tiny bit harder but not much. I felt like I didn't get the seams pressed together well enough but during the baking they spread together so it was fine.  Don't feel like you have to make it perfect because you are covering the top in the cinn/sugar mix. This is fabulous.  I made it exactly as called for except I only used about 1/2 as much honey as called for at first.  I tasted it and added more and yum.  Use the full amount.  I had to bake it longer than 30 minutes and I was getting worried.  It looked way too brown for comfort but the middle was still a tad gooey.  I kept it in though and it was in no way overdone.  So cook it until the center is done....you won't burn it.  Everyone who ate it wanted more and asked for the recipe.  Try it and I promise it will become a favorite.  ",

If you don't rush right out and pick up the ingredients for this, you are missing out ON LIFE! I have tasted a lot of desserts, I have tried a million recipes, but I can honestly say (and my family will agree) that this is the most wonderful dessert ever. It was made by the Gods. You know how every recipe you read on Allrecipes.com has reviewers improving upon the recipe in some way? Well you won't see that with this recipe. Nope. It would be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to improve on this one in ANY way. It's perfect. Sent from heaven. And in addition to the perfect flavor is the fact that it LOOKS beautiful, even if you throw the crescent rolls in sloppily (like I did). It's also so unbelievably easy to make that I am ASHAMED I didn't know about this sooner because it would have saved me a lot of sweat and stress while trying to throw something together for potlucks. All I can ask is that you not share the recipe with anyone. It's so good it should be a secret!",

To fix this... cream cheese must be a room temperature and mixed using the paddle attachment on the mixer.  Don't use the beater attachment as this won't get the mix as creamy.  Add 1 egg to the cream cheese mixture after the sugar is totally blended.  The egg must be room temperature or it will cause the cream cheese mixture to separate.  \r\nFor the topping, blended the butter, cinnamon and sugar using the paddle attachment.  Spreads it as best you can.  While cooking, if the dough puffs up and the butter puddles, use a pastry brush to redistribute the butter and cinnamon.  Do this again after it comes out of the oven.  \r\nDon't skip the honey.  Don't eat until the next day (flavors need time to set up and cheesecake should not be eaten right out of the oven).\r\nFor all you haters that don't like when people post the changes they made ... I disagree. Seeing how others have adjusted the recipe helps me decide how to tailor to my tastes.  I always rate based on recipe as written, but I like to share my changes in case anyone else finds them useful.",

WAYYY to sweet hurt your teeth sweet! tastes like pure sugar.. The cream cheese center needs to be firmer adding an egg would really help.. The melted butter made PUDDLES on the top crust that's just gross so cut down the butter as well.",
