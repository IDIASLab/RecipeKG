Based on my love of hot chai, I began to feel that North Americans have a distinct lack of health-giving herbs and spices in our native cuisine. Hopefully a delicious hot cup of Viennexican can assist. Thinking of the spiciness of Viennese coffees and of the chocolate and fruit flavors of South American beverages, I believe the combination makes a beautiful result for the taste buds and the system as a whole!",

Don't know that I'd drink this on a regular basis, but it certainly would be nice for a special occasion or a special dinner/brunch.  Enjoyed this, but for my taste, it was too cinnamon-y, so I'll cut that in half in the future.  Also, if you're using milk & cream (which equates to 1/4 cup) directly from the fridge, you will not have a hot cup of coffee, so you may want to give it a quick heat in the microwave.  It was a nice break from my usual cup of \"joe.\"",

Regardless, I would drink this again. Somehow the cocoa and the orange really make it a treat that isn't too much of any one flavor. They all balance and blend nicely. As far as method is concerned though, I would warm the milk and mix all the ingredients EXCEPT the coffee in a mug then, once combined well, add the hot coffee. Otherwise your coffee will get cold. I ended up popping it in the microwave for a few seconds because I like hot coffee. Otherwise it really is a nice cup to share with a cookie. Thanks magicdress for sharing this recipe.",
