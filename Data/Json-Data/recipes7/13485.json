The tapioca congealed into clumps in the boiling water; there was no draining the pearls. When I tried to drink the tea the tapioca clogged up the straw so I have to think I didn t use the right pearl tapioca. Next time I m near the Asian market I ll stop in and see what they have for pearl tapioca and perhaps try this again. In spite of that the taste was still pretty good.",
