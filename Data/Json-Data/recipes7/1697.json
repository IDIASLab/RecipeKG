(I also find that roasting veg rather than steaming gives the soup an odd after taste so I avoid it whenever possible.) I didn't have any celery but the soup tasted fine without it and I added 1/2 cup rather than 1/4 cup of orange juice to mellow the taste a bit. The end result was lovely & this recipe will definately be used again - a great autumn/winter soup!",

I used salt-free boullion and added a tsp of salt; instead of adding more salt I tried Chipotle Tabasco in my bowl and it added an other dimension to the soup.
