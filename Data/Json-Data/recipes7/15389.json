In order to get enough juice for the dressing I took a couple segments of each and squeezed the juice out of them. The dressing was not thick but just enough to give the greens a good wilt. That might have been my fault though for not fully understanding the directions regarding the orange and grapefruit. I'm not sure? Regardless I liked this and it is one I will make again. Bacon would be a nice addition.",
