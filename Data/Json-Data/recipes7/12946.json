As an Italian who grew up with this humble dish herself (using the summer zucchini bounty from Grandma s and Mom s plentiful gardens) I can vouch for its satisfying deliciousness. Or maybe I m just swayed by sentimentality. While olive oil is a kitchen staple in this instance I ve always preferred to make this with butter. And while zucchini is a great foundation it needn t stop there. I added onion and minced garlic today but tomatoes and/or mushrooms are great additions as well. To finish I like a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan upon serving.",
