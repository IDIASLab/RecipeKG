I couldn't taste the pineapple or coconut so I added more pineapple in and coconut sprinkled on top with sugar for the second test. Upon tasting them I added more pineapple, coconut and dried cranberries. Then I could taste the pineapple a little more and I just love cranberries. I wont make this recipe again but thanks for sharing.",
