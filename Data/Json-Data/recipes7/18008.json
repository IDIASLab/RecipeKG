It looks super spicy and, originally, it is! But you can control the amount of chile paste. You might be able to find it easily at food vendors on the street of Korea. There are always delicious dukbokki boiling and ready to go. Garnish with sesame seeds if you like.",

It's also my favorite dish to introduce to newbies to this type of Asian cuisine. Of note:  the recipe mentions \"fish cakes\" but not \"rice cakes.\" Both are a must for this dish. I didn't have fish cakes on hand so could not use them this time (quarantine) but I always have rice cakes either in the fridge or the freezer. Loved the sweet sauce, although I reduced the sugar to 1.5 T since this recipe called for corn syrup (which I actually loved this addition). I also added minced garlic to the sauce. And I was very varied in my Korean fish stock. The ingredients used...water and anchovies are, of course, great, but I added konbu, green onion, onion, dried mushrooms, ginger to the stock, then strained all that out to make the broth clear. Super flavorful this way. Overall, the sauce is what made the dish for me, and I appreciate the author taking the time to capture the recipe!",
