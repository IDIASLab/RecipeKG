The only complaint I have is the icing turned blue because of the sprinkles and didn't look as appatizing as I would have liked but still delish.... I would suggest making the icing and then sprinkling sprinkles on top- although I did run out of my regular colored sprinkles that I used inside the pancake batter and used dot sprinkles in the icing so that could have been the problem. So I wouldn't use the little round sprinkles inside or in the icing",

Initially I doubled the recipe and made the recipe as written subbing gluten free flour for all purpose. After letting the batter stand it was quite runny I tried to make 2 pancakes that were too thin so I added an additional half cup of flour (1/4 cup for a single batch). This made the pancake batter perfect. After reading the reviews I decided to whip the heavy cream and make whip cream knowing it would melt all over the pancakes. I folded in the sprinkles before serving to help keeping the color from running that sometimes happens. Even my kids said that the whipped cream was too sweet. These are ok for every now and then but the pancake was just ok nothing special and as mentioned the whipped cream was too sweet and the sugar needs cut way back.",

The sauce wasn't good..my 4 year old dipped her finger in it and said no to it..so we just used syrup. Added chocolate chips as per my girls request. I do sprinkle pancakes for birthdays at home here.. so this ended up being just that pretty much. Pancakes are good I would suggest though tasting sauce before drizzling over...if I do some thing like this again I'll try a cream cheese type drizzle. None the less they are fun and kids will like the colours.",
