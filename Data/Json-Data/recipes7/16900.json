The TVP gives it the texture of ground beef, and the chiles give it a nice depth of flavor. Cook it in the slow cooker or on the stovetop. This recipe really benefits from using the best quality ingredients you can find. Also, I find this tastes best after sitting in the fridge overnight and reheating the next day. Serve with grated cheese on top.",

Neither does the nutritional yeast that I bought specifically for this recipe. I was so focused on following the recipe, that I didn't put it in because it wasn't listed in the directions. I didn't have any unsweetened cocoa, so it got left out but I can see how it would add even more depth to the taste. Poblano chilis weren't available, so I used Anaheim instead. I cooked it for about 9.5 hours overnight, unplugged it in the morning to cool, and refrigerated until it was lunch time. Would be great with some non-dairy sour cream. Well worth all the chopping.",

Also, because people in the house like to decrease the hot spice, we only used one orange pepper rather than the peppers recommend. Decreased the vinegar to 1/2 c and also halved quantities of spices except for soy and Worcester sauce. We added 3/4 recommended amount for cocoa.\nCooked it for 4 hours on the stovetop. Very flavorful. I think meat lovers would agree that it is a crowd pleaser for everyone.\nThis is now the \u201cgo to\u201d chili recipe.",
