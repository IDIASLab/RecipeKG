My parents were stationed in Wiesbaden Germany years ago, and my mother who loves to cook befriended a local german woman and the soon exchanged recipes. THIS cucumber salad better known as Gurkensalat is the CLOSEST I have been able to come to recreating it.. THIS is a MOST LOVED dish.. I don't know if this is the exact way my mother and Petra made this wonderful dish, but if it isn't I couldn't tell. THANK you for posting this and taking me back to my days (years) in Germany with my mother and a wonderful lady named Petra. I STRONGLY ADVISE all who try this recipe to follow exactly DO NOT add or take away.. AND PLEASE let it chill overnight for best result. IF I could give more than 5 stars I WOULD.... I am huge fan of German food and this dish is spot on.",

Followed the recipe to a T, squeezing out excess moisture from cukes and refrigerating overnight. Next day the onions were dismally limp 'strings' so much so that I just fished them all out. The cucmbers were just too mushy. I would really like to skip rating stars on this because it's probably unfair, given I haven't tasted German marinated cukes before and maybe this is how they're supposed to be.  However the AllRecipes system doesn't allow me to post comments without assigning stars, so trying my best to be fair I will rate this a 3 star recipe.",
