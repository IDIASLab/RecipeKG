I leave for work early while my hubby sleeps so its easy peasy to whip one up and leave it for him to get a good Healthy breakfast! I always add a scoop of Uncooked oatmeal just the regular quick kind. Freezing the fruit helps thicken the smoothie up without watering it down with ice cubes. Thank YOU Carolina Blond!",

I cut the recipe in half and had to use an additional 1 cup of liquid to blend it. Only change I made was using homemade almond milk and Truvia for the sweetener which I have done numerous times. It about burned my motor though for some reason. I tasted it and like many typical all banana and strawberry smoothies it had that vitamin after taste that is kind of hard to explain. I fixed it by adding about 1/2 orange. The photo of the recipe looks great either way.",
