                "reviewBody": "although slightly labor intensive if doing them alone, they are worth it in flavor and appearance.  I found the dough very easy to work with.  I let it rest at room temperature and even then, rolling it out and cutting was very easy.  I cut out individual rounds using a biscuit cutter.  The filling was easy to make and I ground the almonds in my magic bullet into a quite fine grind so there wouldn't be large chunks of almond.  This worked very well .  the filling was very easy to work with rolling into balls.  The only thing I questioned was the oven temperature.  I tried them at 325 but it was too low a temp.  even at 350, they took longer than 20 minutes but that's ok because they were golden.  I did up the orange blossom water out of preference.  I would suggest either dipping them in the honey syrup or else dusting them with confectioner's sugar.  by themselves, they are not very sweet.  This is a lovely cookie and well worth the effort.  This is best suited for a group project done production line style for time's sake but I definitely will make these routinely for the holidays.",
