I added a half cup of pure chocolate chips but probably should have added more. The recipe said that it made 24 cookies but they would have been huge. I made 60 2-bite cookies as I was making them to be packaged for a bake sale. I think with a little tweaking to suit my tastes these could become my go to pumpkin cookie!",
