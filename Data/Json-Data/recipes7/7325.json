It is very low in sugar and even with sweet blueberries is tasty healthy but honestly not sweet enough for a pie. Try it as a parfait on frozen yogurt on a dessert and it will be excellent. I made it just for the fact that it had so little sugar compared to similar recipes. I was tempted to add additional water but do not do that. The blueberries will cook down and make their own. I think fresh is a must with this recipes so as to make the cornstarch work effectively without the excess water. I bought a large pack of blueberries at Sam's Club. I measured the package and it was 3 1/2 cups. So I just made 1/4 of the recipe which made enough for 2 large or 3 small parfaits or a blueberry sauce on other foods. 1/4 of the recipe still took 2 cups of blueberries. The full recipe takes 8. I layered it in a glass with Trader Joes Vanilla Bean yogurt and topped it off with a little lite whipped topping I sprayed on top. I thought it was as good or better in this combination as any blueberry cheesecake I have had. Very creamy. TY",
