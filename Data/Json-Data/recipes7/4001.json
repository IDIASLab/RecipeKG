The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white (instead of all white), added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the blender mixture, and sprayed an 8x8 baking dish w/garlic olive oil (I don't have a cast iron skillet). This was certainly full of flavor and I will be making it many times over!   The only bummer is that it only uses 1 cup of zucchini and I needed to get rid of a lot more than that.",
