I made it for Christmas dinner at a friends house - they asked for an 'authentic American' holiday dish but I just can't do candied yams as they are far too sweet. I couldn't be bothered with peeling and chopping so I put the potatoes in the oven instead; the peels fell off and they mashed easily. I reduced the sugar as suggested by others and because baking tends to make for sweeter veg than boiling, so I used 1/2 cup demera sugar. I mixed it up the night before since I had to bake early in the morning before traveling. My husband won't eat tree nuts, so I put crushed honey nut cornflakes on top instead. It baked up beautifully rising up the full height of the dish, but I did have to bake it a good 30 minutes more than the recipe.  Overall, easy to make and wonderful results. EDIT - made it again for dinner with friends without the topping but it was still brilliant! EDIT - Had a friend make it but they pulled it out too soon so more like spoon bread than souffle.",

I used brown sugar instead of white and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also whipped the eggs before adding them, made it very fluffy. It took about an hour total in my oven at 350 the whole time. Before putting it in the oven I sprinkled some brown sugar on top, and after 50 minutes I took it out and put mini marshmallows on top, then put it back in for 10 minutes. Next time I'll probably add some pecans to the topping too. :)",
