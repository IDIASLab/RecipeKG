It made a VERY thick sludge, I added more milk (almost double) so that it was not too thick to pour onto the griddle. I tasted the batter before I put on the first pancake to check the flavor, and WOW it was so bitter I could barely stand it, not enough sugar for the amount of cocoa.  Please people, please stop giving 5 star reviews to recipes you have never tasted! Holy Hanah this stuff is BAD!   I continued and cooked them and added a thick layer of buttercream frosting, (no way is whipped cream sweet enough to fix this bitter), and they are edible.  Tough (I admit to overmixing as I added milk 3 times to get the right consistency), Heavy, Bland, The chocolate flavor barely comes through, and if you get a bite of the pancake without frosting, it is seriously bitter.  As written, this recipe is a time and ingredient waster.",
