It's rich and creamy peanut buttery sweet but not sickeningly so. It's more time consuming than many recipes for fudge I've made but it's definitely worth the extra time. I didn't use a thermometer I used a slotted metal spoon and cooked it until the milk and sugar was thick enough to coat the spoon but also allow for the mixture to slowly seep through. LIke others have said you really should have a good size heavy pot because it will boil over and make a huge mess. I used a 2 qt heavy stainless steel pot and it was almost good enough to have no boil over...almost. Instead of cooking spray I used wax paper. I didn't change anything for the ingredients.",
