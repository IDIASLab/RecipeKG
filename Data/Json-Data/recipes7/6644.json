I followed the recipe exactly, because I think it is unfair to rate a recipe that has been modified. It is delicious as it stands - the texture is so smooth and it is very, very rich. The directions are easy to follow, and it is uncomplicated to make. There were three of us at dinner, and I divided it into fourths, but it would easily serve six, as none of us could completely finish our portions. My husband commented that it could be more colorful, so I think I'll add some diced sweet red pepper to the mushrooms next time I make it. I might also use diced onion and garlic, as some reviewers have suggested. Also, it took mine a full hour in the oven to be ready to eat. Thanks for the great recipe; we all agreed that I should make it again, soon.",

I was fridge-raiding to use up my overstock of eggs, but didn't have all the ingredients, so I used different cheese (mozzarella and a basil/tomato white cheddar mixed) and threw in a little Sopressa for kicks and this quiche turned out better than most I've purchased at bistros.  \nI highly recommend trying this out and/or adding your own twist.  It was easy to prepare before baking as well, which is important to me.",

Very little prep time involved as using a blender to make the egg mixture speeds up the process - - pop it in the oven and go about doing other tasks. Made changes based on suggestions by some reviewers as well as an aim to reduce the fat content and pack this already healthy quiche with more vegetables. Instead of 2 cups sour cream, used 1-1/4 cups sour cream and 3/4 cup nonfat Greek yogurt (6 oz. tub) based on several reviewers feeling it was a tad sour tasting. Added 1/4 red bell pepper, 1 large carrot, 1/4 Vidalia onion, 2 cloves garlic, and the entire (10 ounce) package frozen spinach. Left the egg mixture pretty much as is except for adding 1 more egg and subbing almond milk for the heavy whipping cream. Used a 9\" deep dish ceramic pie baker, and the dish was filled perfectly. Took 50 minutes to bake given the extra ingredients which were added. The only change next time would be to adjust the seasonings a little for our personal preferences and be a bit more liberal with the hot sauce. Thank you for sharing, hrgdane, and this recipe is destined to be a winner on this site.",
