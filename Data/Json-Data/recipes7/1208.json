When it says to bring to a boil again: drain the vegetables, boil the liquid, spoon the vegetables into the jars, and pour the boiled liquid over them. This is a great method for cucumber pickles as well, because it allows the vegetables to release all their little bubbles, and then allows you to boil off any impurities that may spoil the final product.",

Didn't measure salt, just sprinkled canning salt to squash/onion mixture then tossed occasioanally for almost 2 hours, drained, packed jars, then added boiled brine.  Heated lids and allowed to seal without coldpacking, period.  I know some would say this is unsafe, but we ate a pint tonight and will refrigerate and eat the rest soon.  These turned out great, like bread and butter and we love!  Thank you!",

Both versions worked out very well.  I agree with the previous reviewers who state to leave the squash raw.  I even cut it a little thicker than normal to make sure it stays crisp.",
