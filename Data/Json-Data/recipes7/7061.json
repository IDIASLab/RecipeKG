I used a dark chocolate brownie mix and I subtracted a teaspoon of water and added teaspoon of vanilla to the brownie mixture.

I baked these brownies in my Perfect Brownie Pan--baked at 350 they were done in just over 30 minutes. After letting them cool we dug into these brownies. HEAVENLY.

I have brownie issues (overdone underdone crumbly battery-y etc) so I decided to try this in mini muffin tins. They worked ok but I never nailed the bake time so some were still gooey and some were overdone. (This will work if you're good w/brownie bake times/doneness. I obviously am not.) I jumped ship and finished the way the submitter intended but in an 8X8 pan since I'd used 1/2 the batter. These worked much better and were delicious. I used a Duncan Hines box mix since it needed to be a 9X13 sized mix. THANK YOU for the recipe Erica!",

I didn't really 'swirl' it in too much so maybe that makes a difference? Also I didn't have any mini pb cups so I added some chocolate chips. I only baked for 35 minutes- at 25 they were still gooey on the edge. I suppose I should always obey my cardinal rule of brownie making: always underbake them. If I try it again I would leave out the flour in the pb mix and maybe increase the sugar. Even the batter tasted odd after I added the flour. Not sure what went wrong.",
