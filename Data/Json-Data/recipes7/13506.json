Unsure of what my original recipe was I settled on this one. While on the stove top my custard was still rather liquidy at seven minutes. At nine minutes though it suddenly went from liquid and foamy on top to a thick custard. In the span of about thirty seconds it thickened up and all the foam mixed in perfectly. At that point I reduced the heat for the last minute. I'm not sure what the point of the strainer was mostly it just seemed to be messy. I'll skip that step next time. Otherwise this pie was a breeze! I'll be using this one whenever my sister asks from now on.",
