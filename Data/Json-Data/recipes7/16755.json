        "description": "This recipe was given to me by my Russian teacher/neighbor. It is tried and true, and my family loves it! Cooking time really depends on how many skillets you are using! Many years ago when I first started making the blini, I used 1 skillet and it took forever to use up all the batter. Now I use 4 skillets and the time goes by quickly. I have substituted coconut oil and it tastes delicious, but it tends to harden if the batter is cold. Batter can be refrigerated for later use. Serve hot with sour cream and/or jelly.",

Yum--they're the real deal! I did not have oil and substituted butter which is never a bad thing! Also I cut the recipe in half and will still be eating blinis all week! I think this volume is for a Maslenitsa celebration! The other recipes I saw looked too thick and blinis should be thin and foldable! This one was perfect. Thanks for posting!",
