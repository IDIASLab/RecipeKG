I also like a lot of cinnamon, so I used 2 teaspoons rather than 1.\n* I placed these in a jelly roll pan (10\" X 16\"), 3 across, 6 down for a total of 18. When they baked, they were all puffy and touching so the edges didn't all get brown, which IMHO is what you want with cinnamon rolls.\n\nThis is replacing my former \"go-to\" cinnamon roll recipe. Easy and delicious.",

There's a good chance you will need more flour as mentioned in directions, because they can be quite sticky. I paired them with the \"Simple Orange Glaze\" recipe on here. Delicious. Much faster to make than traditional cinnamon rolls too (love that part.)",

One of my kids said, \"This is better than one of those bakery cinnamon rolls at the grocery store!\".  My picky husband said that I should submit this recipe to the state-fair contest.  Seriously.  These were amazing.  Soft inside and perfect outside.  I did make two minor changes.  I doubled the cinnamon, and I baked at 375, so they were a tad brown on the top (baked for 18 mins).  I also made a simple icing recipe.  Just pour over the freshly baked cinnamon rolls after pulling them out of the oven, while still in the pan. (Mix 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 TB butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 TB milk).",
