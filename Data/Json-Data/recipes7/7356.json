A little too acidic and not the nice creaminess I was hoping for with the coconut milk I would say the lemon is the dominant flavor. The whole family ate it but not something we will make again. I did add some shredded carrot and cucumber to the bed of salad and I liked the idea of a warm noodle dish over salad. It had a nice fresh feeling for a pasta dish.",

I used the entire 12 oz. can of coconut milk and added in chopped straw mushrooms with the bean sprouts for extra flavor. I winged the herbs and it still came out amazing. It has a creamy lemon basil taste to it with good bite from al dente spaghetti and the straw mushrooms. I would recommend this to anyone that loves lemon.",
