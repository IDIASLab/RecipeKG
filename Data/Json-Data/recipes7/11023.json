I used a 9-1/2\" springform pan, adding about 8 minutes to the cook time to get it set. I only ended up using 1/2 of the sour cream topping, so I know to halve that next time for my size pan. This cheese cake was one of the firsts that I have made that did not crack at all and did not brown on top...it was PERFECT (and cut beautifully)! I did put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven while this was baking, so I'm sure that helped. Creamy, rich and yummy...everything a good cheesecake should be. I served it with salted caramel drizzle and strawberries, mmmmm.... I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

My only complaint is the 30 minutes and eventual phone call to my brother's house, to figure out how many (full size) nilla wafers equal 7 ounces. I will save you the trouble -it's 53. You're welcome. I made it in a (greased) springform pan. My crust appeared to be a little burnt but didn't taste burnt at all and there were no complaints.. I served with a raspberry sauce (just a pint of berries and a bit of sugar, blended well in my vitamix, then strained the seeds out). Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again and often!",

I made it in a glass 9 by 13 inch pan and didn't have trouble with cracks or flaws like I have with some other cheesecakes. I didn't do a water bath or anything like that. It wasn't a thick cheesecake in that size pan but the potions came out as yummy bars that I decorated with a fruit topping. The sour cream topping was subtle. Maybe without the fruit you would notice it more. I used graham cracker crumbs and butter for the crust which was great & what I would prefer. My family loved it and it was not too difficult. A keeper!",
