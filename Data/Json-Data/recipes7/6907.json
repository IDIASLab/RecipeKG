I used 9 cups of the aunt jemima's corn flour mix (omit flour and corn flour and baking powder, it's what I had in stock), I did not have the pimento peppers so I omit it, I blended the onion and bell peppers because my kids and hubby don't like to eat onion chunks. They are so good and still good after frozen. Some tips for others : this recipes will make hundreds of hush puppies so you will spend hours on frying them. The hushpuppies will be bigger after frying so 6-8 tbs will make an apple or pear size, too big for my kids. A tablespoon is perfect for kids, will make a strawberry size hush puppies.",
