Instead of 3 cups of half and half I used a cup and a half then made up the difference with 2% milk to make it less rich and less fattening. I don't think garlic belongs in tomato soup so next time I'm leaving it out or greatly minimizing it. With my modifications it turned out quitry tasty. I'll be making it again for sure.",

I also cook the tomato paste for a few minutes so it will caramelize slightly. Then I pour in the broth pureed tomatoes 2 cups milk 1 cup half-and-half Worcestershire sauce; and let that come up to temp. Then I add in a little soy sauce molasses (instead of white sugar) garlic powder onion powder pepper oregano and a little paprika. I serve it with fresh greens boiled eggs olives chick peas and whatever else I have in the fridge; as kind of a tomato-soup-bar for dinner lol.
