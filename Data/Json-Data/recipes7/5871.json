I found that the crust was too runny to create sides to the cheesecake (not really an issue). The next time I make this I will be making a couple of modifications - Oreo cookie crumb crust cherry pie pilling instead of maraschinos. As is this is pretty tasty. With these changes possibly divine.",

I think maybe a little less butter would make it easier. I used a spring form pan which didn't seem to cause any problems or need too much additional baking time. I found the cherry sauce to be a bit mild though. I would suggest maybe making a cherry sauce using fresh or frozen cherries with some sugar and thickener as you would a pie filling. The sauce heated well (I used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken) but with the final product it was just over-powered by the cheesecake itself.",

The chocolate graham crust was delicious, but I had trouble getting it to stay up the sides as well.  I used a pie plate and refrigerated it before baking to get the butter firm and set, but nonetheless, it started to ooze up the sides somewhat during baking from the weight of the cream cheese filling.  If you use a springform, I don't think you will have any issues as it did bake nicely for me on the bottom.  I used a canned cherry pie filling but I placed it on top after baking and refrigeration.  The only critique came from one friend who could taste the canned fruit flavor. \n This is heavy, rich, and decadent, and I will be revisiting it again in the future - with the added effort of a scratch-made cherry topping since this is a proven recipe for me now.",
