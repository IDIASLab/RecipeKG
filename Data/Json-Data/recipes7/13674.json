I took my mom's great chocolate cake and added to it to create this masterpiece which recently took first place in the cake division of our city bake-off. My husband took the leftovers to a Chemistry Society meeting and they said that it was amazing and he didn't bring any back home with him. I hope you enjoy it just as much as those judges and those crazy chemists.",

I used extra cherry juice in the batter and added a few Tb of sour cream. I used the left over Cherry juice and combined with pectin and cherries to make a gel for the middle layers. After adding the cherries on top I melted chocolate and drizzled over the cherry top and down the sides. It was moist tasty and beautiful.",

I also didn't want to take the time to pipe the icing on the cake and I don't like the way whipping cream looks when it is used like a frosting. So I shaved an ounce of semi-sweet chocolate on top of it. It worked out beautifully.",
