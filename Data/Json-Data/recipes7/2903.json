The recipe filled a standard-sized pitcher, including fruit. If you use 2 cups of pre-made lemonade instead of lemon juice like I did, you can just put in 1/2 cup sugar (and add more to taste if you want). I used two-buck Chuck shiraz, which worked really well, and cut up an orange, apple, and pear to float. I lived in Spain for awhile, and this tastes a lot closer to the real deal than I expected! :) gracias",

I really liked this but my bf said it was just \"OK\" (he thought it tasted like fruit punch but I think it was the \"wine\" talking... haha!). Since I am not a huge wine fan I thought this was great! The taste of wine did exist but I do agree that it was very subtle. Prepared almost to a T... my only changes were to use sangria wine (as opposed to red wine) and ginger ale instead of club soda. Additionally I added 1 sm. Red Delicious apple 1 Granny Smith apple and 2 Anjou pears (peels on). Made half a batch (which was plenty for the two of us). Oh and I purchased my sangria wine from Caputo's Italian market but later that day saw the stuff that Katie recommended (i.e. \"Real Sangria\") at a different chain grocery store - and it was more expensive). Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe! I'm sure this would pair nicely with paella.",
