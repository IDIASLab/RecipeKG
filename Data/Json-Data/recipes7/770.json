I decided to try this recipe for our Easter dinner yesterday as a special treat for him.  It was a huge success. :)  He said, \"this is every bit as delicious as _________ restaurant!\"  So there you have it -- from the mahi-loving man himself. ;)\n\nI did make a few changes to the recipe: first, I used more nuts than bread crumbs because I only had seasoned crumbs and didn't want the nutty flavor to get lost.  Second, I forgot to buy a habanero pepper so I just threw some crushed red pepper flakes into the sauce while it simmered.  The spiciness was perfect.  Next, I used about twice as much coconut as the recipe called for because I really wanted the coconut flavor to stand out.  Also, since I used canned pineapple chunks rather than fresh, I used the syrup from the can to sweeten the sauce rather than sugar.  And lastly, I served the sauce over the fish without straining it, sort of like a chutney -- the chunks of fruit were really tasty with the fish.\n\nSuperb recipe!",

Changes I made:  I used a whole can of macadamia nuts (6 ounces) and a smaller amount of bread crumbs (maybe 2-3 ounces?).  I found that I wanted more coating than the recipe calls for.  I also dipped each fillet in an egg mixture (1 whole egg + 1 egg white) before coating.\n\nFor the sauce I didn\u2019t use the pepper as mentioned in other reviews, and instead just added a few shakes of crushed red pepper. I also only used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 and found that I still needed to add a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce appropriately.  Instead of fresh fruit, I used canned mixed tropical fruit cups.  And instead of sugar, I sweetened the sauce with the juice from the cans (I left the fruit in the sauce when I stirred in the cornstarch instead of straining out the fruit and it was fine this way).  Finally I served the sauce and fruit over the fish like chutney.  I received RAVES from everyone\u2026I had reserved sauce so I served that on the table as well, and everyone was scraping the bowl.  This was definitely a winner and I will certainly be making it again!  My boyfriend LOVED it.  Oh, and another reviewer mentioned that it is a lot of prep work\u2026I didn\u2019t find that to be the case if you used the canned fruits and crushed red pepper\u2026the only chopping I had to do was the onion.  Great recipe!!",

I used canned tropical fruit and juice to sweeten; 2. Used chili paste from a tube; 3. Used a can of coconut milk instead of regular coconut (it made the sauce thicker) 4. I also dipped the filets in an egg mixture to ensure even coating. 5. I pureed the sauce instead of straining-- if you do this you'll have twice as much as you would otherwise. My bf was so impressed he suggested we save the leftover sauce so I can make it again TOMORROW!! Also I used frozen fish and boullion (not stock)- this meant I didn't have to simmer the sauce in order to reduce.",

Worked like a charm. Also did not have haberno peppers so like others I used a dash or two or crushed red pepper flakes (which really gave the dish some heat!). I strained the sauce to thicken it with some cornstarch once it was thickened I added the fruit back to it and served over the baked fish as one reviewer said like a chutney. Keep in mind if you have thick mahi fillets like I had (mine were probably at least 1\" thick) you may have to increase oven time - mine took about 20 min. Also be forewarned - this is a time-consuming recipe and I didn't even chop my fruit I bought the del monte fresh chopped fruit cups. Still a dish to impress your guests. Thanks for sharing!",

Not to mention that the steps listed are out of order! It says to brown the fish then start cooking the sauce for 30 minutes then finish cooking the fish for only 10 minutes in the oven. What do you do with the browned fish for 30 minutes while the sauce cooks? I should have read this recipe more carefully.",

                "reviewBody": "FANTASTIC!! I wish I could give this 10 stars! My husband called in the afternoon to say that he had just caught some dorado (that's what us So-Cal folks call mahi mahi) and I wanted to make something that was going to be different than the way I had eaten it before (plain grilled or raw with soy sauce). This was the most delicious fish I have EVER had--restaurant or home cooked--the best. Each and every flavor could be tasted and they combined so well. I had never cooked with habaneros before and DO NOT use more than two but they gave the perfect heat to the sweet fruits and coconut. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to taste the macadamia nuts but even they made themselves known in this recipe. Considering the fish was \"free\" (sorta) it wasn't too expensive of a meal but it is definitely worth the cost even if you have to buy the fish. This meal is worthy of heads of state and actually impressed my husband (he's a fisher not an eater of fish). I will make sure to keep these ingredients on hand during dorado season. Thank you for the superb recipe (and for making me look like a 5-star chef!)",
