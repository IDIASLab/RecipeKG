I try not to make any changes to the recipes, but because our local food store did not carry peanut oil, I changed that out and used Olive Oil.  Also, I did use Udon noodles (as one reviewer suggested) rather than Ramen noodles, which I am glad I did.  These noodles are more expensive, but the package contained three bundled servings, and one bundle was perfect for the meal.  The flavors in this dish were a treat to the taste bud's and my husband even commented that this meal is a keeper.  In addition, I did velvet my chicken, which I saw on this site, Velveting Chicken Breast, Chinese Restaurant-Style.  I will be doing this to my chicken from now on. It was so moist and tender.  Thank you Shelley for an awesome meal!",
