I asked two of my friends and showed them the recipe, and they laughed at me. :( The pale orange color is not due to tomato paste, it should be due to the paprika. Rather than tomato paste, I now use 1.5 tablespoons of rice vinegar and 1.5 tablespoons of takara mirin (cooking wine). Though these can be adjusted to taste. Don't use the fake kikoman mirin found in most general supermarkets either. \n\nLastly. If available in your area, use Kewpie mayo or any other Japanese brand mayo. It is more yolk based and will give you a more authentic taste if you've eaten at a more authentic hibachi joint.\n\nYou can also go the route of making your own mayo from a Japanese recipe. ... I've also seen sakura recipes without paprika and instead use soy sauce, mirin, garlic powder, and pepper. Experiment a little. :)",
