They aren't the prettiest cookies with that date lump in them but they are really tasty and my husband liked them. That's what counts most.:-) I had to cook them a little longer than stated; my oven may run a little low. I had more frosting than I needed even frosting the cookies generously. It will be good on cinnamon rolls another day though.",
