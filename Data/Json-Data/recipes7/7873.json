Finding this recipe and discovering that the dates were mixed with chocolate I thought my family would like them as they are not huge date fans. I made as directed but changed the pan size to 11 x 7 because I did not have an 8 x 10 pan. I also made half the pan with walnuts and the other half without for my son. The results were a nice chewy bar with a crunchy topping. I thoroughly enjoyed the end results but I love dates. The guys liked them but kept asking what the middle layer was. I told them chocolate but they knew there was something else in there. I just kept them guessing. I thought they were repeat worthy the guys said once is enough.",
