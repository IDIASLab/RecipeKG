They were not glazed...kinda crumbly. My camera is broken otherwise I would post a pic. I first measured out 10 c of pecans and realized they would not fit into two 9x13 pans in a single layer. So I reduced the amount of pecans (about 6 C. fit into three 9x13 pans). I also didn't put the whole Tbs of red pepper bc of kids. I cooked a little longer to \"roast\" the pecan but watch carefully you don't want to burn the sugar/candy coating. Enjoy!",

I really wanted them to be sweeter so I may increase the sugar or decrease the chili powder or both next time I make these (and there will be a next time). I followed the recipe almost exactly only reducing the cayenne because we have kids. Maybe I should have baked them a little longer because they were sticky and soft. I let them cool completely on the counter hoping they would dry out and crisp up some but they didn't so I put them back in the oven at 225 and roasted them \"chex mix style\" for 1 hr and 15 min. stirring them every 15 minutes and they got nice and crunchy without burning. I'm glad I didn't give up on them because they are a unique yummy snack to set out for company. Thanks for this recipe!:)",
