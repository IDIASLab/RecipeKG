UPDATE:  My dinner guests LOVED this bread... nice & moist, full of flavor...one man ate 3 BIG PIECES of this with his dinner!!!  I toasted a slice this morning, YUMMY!!  The loaf stays very moist & soft...It's a KEEPER!!\n\n12/2/16 UPDATE:  This is the only bread I make now.. My friends always ask for it, I even send some home with them!  The ''shelf-life'' is very short for them, they eat it quickly... I'm guessing I may need to make loaves for Christmas Gifts too!",
