The dough is stiff but seems in keeping with every other German Kuchen of this sort that I have made. It still came out light and tasty so don't worry about that aspect. My only change would be the topping. First the recipe makes WAY too much topping for the size of the cake. I only used about a 1/3 of it. Also the topping didn't really seem to serve a purpose and just sat on top of the batter without seeming to cook or incorporate into cake. It was basically sugar flour dumped onto cake and took away from the cake itself. Since the German palette prefers less sugar anyway (and who needs the calories) I would omit the topping completely next time. That being said the basic cake was very good.",

                "reviewBody": "Delicious! My German mother makes pflaumenkuchen when we can find the good fresh Italian plums. This means about once a year usually. I found some canned plums and decided to give this recipe a try. It worked BEAUTIFULLY! So in case you wondered you can substitute the fresh for canned just make sure to pat the plums as dry as you can before baking. Also yes the \"batter\" is stiff. It's not meant to be batter it's meant to be dough that is pressed into the pan. Many German kuchen recipes are done this way because most German cakes tarts etc. are meant to be had with coffee so they have to be sturdy;-) Yes you can add sourcream to the dough to loosen it up and it tastes okay but it's delicious (and much more authentic) to make the recipe as is. The only major change I made-aside from canned fruit-was to use vanilla sugar (vanilla zucker) instead of liquid vanilla extract. Again simply because it's more traditional.",

I followed the recipe except that I added about 1 cup of sour cream as a lot of the reviewers said it was a bit dry. I left out the crumble topping because when my German grandmother made it it didn't have that and I didn't think it needed it. Lastly I sliced the plums into thin strips and pushed them skin side out into the batter because again that's how my grandmother did it. I think it makes a prettier presentation and it would be easier to slice. It came out fabulous. Everyone loved it. It was moist and not too sweet. I will be making it again!",
