I admit I did make a few changes/additions.  I used a sweet potato for the regular potato, apple cider for the wine and added a dash of ginger and cumin.  Oh, and I used a Honeycrisp apple (very similar to Granny Smith but not quite as tart) instead of the Granny Smith.  I will definitely be making this one again.  A tip for handling the butternut squash-microwave whole for a few minutes, let cool then cut in quarters, seed, peel and cube.",

I also never ever have leeks on hand so I used regular onions.  Used butter substitute and fat free half and half.  No need for the extra fat.  This soup does not need it. I've also given it a few shakes of sage,thyme,rosemary and black pepper in addition to the nutmeg.  Awesome soup.  Just made it again tonight and added about 1 tspn of chopped fresh ginger just to give it some kick.  It was super.  Topped it with fat free sour cream and some homemade croutons (recipe from this site) Thanks for sharing !",

I followed the recipe exactly without the optional wine. It was so bland what after we tried it we went back and added a lot more things like cinnamon cloves more salt just trying to get it to taste great but it still is just a very bland soup. I very much prefer the Creamy Butternut Squash with Cinnamon Soup from this site. NO comparison!!",
