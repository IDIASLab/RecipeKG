I made them last night for my small group and one of my friends who is a health-obsessed dr. actually ate one and was licking his plate by the time he was done lol! I did make a few changes: Okay-here are the things I changed for the recipe-I doubled it to make 16 servings (8 apples) I used the big ones you buy in bulk but if you bought the smaller ones I think you could probably use a whole apple for this-I used granny smith. Also I cut them in half horizontally then cored then and stuffed the filling inside that way-it was really easy and I didn't have to cut anything off the bottom because I just laid them on their flat sides. I put them on the crust and then I stuffed them so as not to make a huge mess trying to get them onto the crust. I doubled the filling and it used every bit so you could even do more and just pile it in the crust for more of that part-which was the best part I thought! I made my own crust-way better in my opinion. Also we used 350-I had taken them to my friends house and wanted them to be hot so I baked them there but left the recipe at home so I wasn't sure on the temperature-I did the 425 for 10 minutes and then 350 for 20 minutes- but I thought they were done enough-I had eight of them on a pampered chef stone and 8 on a metal air bake cookie sheet. The ones on the stone turned out even better so I would probably use that again or if you used a metal dish or baking sheet maybe reduce the cooking time. The ones on the met",

Certainly I would like about 1/3 more pie crust. I used a 15 ounce (2 sheets) pie crust and it was stretched thin in some places thin enough that when I tried to move the dumplings to a serving dish some of them \"ripped\" and fell apart. Of course homemade crust is always going to be better if you have the time. Also I used buttered foil and my dumplings still stuck to the bottom of the dish so you might want to cook them in the serving dish or use the parchment. If you want a richer caramel cinnamon sauce omit 1/2 cup of the water and replace with heavy cream. It takes the sauce from great to unbelievable.",

Luckily my mom and dad LOVED this so I at least feel good about that.:) If given the choice I'd much rather have apple pie - simple basic apple pie just tastes better (and is MUCH easier to assemble) IMHO. The second turnoff for me was the addition of nuts in this. I did not care for them at all. They kinda seemed out of place (but that's just my.02). The biggest letdown for me was the sauce. It simply lacked oomph. The sauce tasted bland and was oddly thick but not in a sticky or syrupy sort of way (if that makes any sense). Don't get me wrong. This wasn't terrible. It just wasn't for me. Better luck for everyone else I guess. Thanks anyways Pam!:-)",
