                "reviewBody": "Overall this overnight oat recipe is a good starting point. 1 tbsp of cinnamon though? That's too much--and takes it from a nice spiciness to bitter really fast. I only used a teaspoon of it and that was plenty for a cinnamon-lover like myself (my husband would prefer a 1/2 tsp or less). Also 1/4 cup milk was not enough liquid to soften 3/4 cup of oats properly (even with the 1/2 cup of yogurt). So I added in an additional 1/4 cup of milk and let it sit for a few hours longer. With these changes it came out tasting pretty good with a nicer texture! Next time I would use brown sugar or maple syrup in place of white sugar add a few drops of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.",
