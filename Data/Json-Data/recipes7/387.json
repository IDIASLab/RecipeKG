THESE COOKIES have a nice nutty flavor from the whole wheat and they spread out but not too much like some other chocolate chip cookies. next time and there will defintely be one i will bake these at the suggested time. PLEASE ignore the other reviewer (excuse me) but i have absolutely no explanation as to why this cookie didn't turn out for them. whole wheat does take some getting used to perhaps that's it. have a glass of milk handy for this one!",

Might as well be eating a candy bar!  Next time - I will add a MAXIMUM of 1 cup of chips for this entire recipe - or just eliminate them altogether and substitute 1 cup of brickle chips.",

To anyone who likes pecans as much as I do 1/4 - 1/2 cup of extra pecans works well. Also I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of the cookies before I baked them:)",

I didn't do nuts this time maybe next time. I baked them for the 10 min. suggested and let sit on the cookie sheet for 2 min. and then moved to cooling rack. Perfect! Only other suggestion is that if you have a dog keep these and any chocolate away from him. My 2 yr. old puppy ate 1/2 of one before I could catch him. Chocolate can kill dogs. Thanks for a great recipe. Oh and have a cold glass of milk available for dunking.",
