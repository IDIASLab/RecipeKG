The marinade is delicious. Only other change I made was to add more green onion.  This recipe is certainly a \"keeper\".  Only regret is I didn't double or triple the batch.  I won't make that mistake again. Thank you for sharing this great cucumber variation.

Only I know I need to at least double it because it doesn't make very much-though I don't think I'd make enough for leftovers because the flavor is pretty strong and it's easy enough to just make it up for dinner (I ate the whole thing myself and was glad I didn't have to share it!) I also think some shredded daikon could be good in this. I had a huge cucumber (seedless) and there was more than enough vinaigrette. My sweet chili sauce had garlic in it so I left the extra garlic out. Everything else was the same and I found the amounts perfect although I am a lover of sesame oil. Sprinkled some sesame seeds on the top. Great Asian side dish! Thanks!",
