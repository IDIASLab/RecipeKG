                "reviewBody": "When I originally read the recipe I saw that this used two separate pots which seemed burdensome to me. I've always made my potatoes in the broth and added in the dumplings when the potatoes were almost done. Much easier than this way but the cooking the potatoes separately in butter added a great new level to the broth. I will most likely use this technique again as the broth was fantastic. 5 star for sure. However the dumplings were 3 star at best. They would have benefited from more egg. It makes them a little less dense. Also the dill was completely out of place. I'm not sure about the parsley because the dill was so strong. So I like this recipe but the dumplings need help which is ok. I also thought that there was too much pepper and would likely cut that by close to half next time. The last thing is that the broth didn't thicken up and it could stand a little thickener (corn starch & water) towards the end of the cook time.",
