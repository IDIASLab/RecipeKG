For the whole bowl, we left out the white sugar completely and put in half a tablespoon more of matcha.  We also used chocolate chunks instead of white chocolate.\n\nThe first batch came out, and they looked pretty, but they tasted like regular chocolate chip cookies so we were kind of disappointed.\n\nSo for the second batch, we added more of the matcha powder like about another tablespoon, which made the matcha taste come out a little more, but made the cookies a darker color and less pretty.  We also added a pinch more salt for the second batch because the first one was lacking.\n\nOverall though, it was kind of disappointing because matcha is so expensive and this needed so much before the flavor came out.  I used maeda-en culinary quality matcha.",

I double checked the ingredient amounts so I don't believe I made any error. While baking they don't spread at all so I ended up with some pretty ugly cookies lol. I did enjoy the tea flavor (I used a bit more than the recipe called for) but found them too sweet and the texture was on the dry side. I'll still use them this holiday but I doubt I'll make them again.",

I prefer softened butter to melted butter so the cookies keep their round shape. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Use a melon baller to scoop the cookies and add 5-6 white chocolate chips per cookie - white chocolate chips are extremely sweet! Bake for 10 minutes, leave on the sheet for an additional 2 minutes, and let cool. The matcha produces a beautiful green color. You can always add more matcha to meet your taste. A guaranteed hit!",
