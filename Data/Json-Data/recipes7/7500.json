I wasn t terribly excited to make these so it was a nice surprise when I found they were much better than I had expected of them. They re thick but not too thick; not poofy in other words course I did flatten them slightly on the cookie sheet before I popped them into the oven. I substituted chocolate covered raisins for the chocolate chips and even tho the cookies were delicious with them I can only imagine how much more rich and chocolatey they d be with the chips. Delicious for sure either way. I made no changes to the recipe and after baking them found none were necessary.",
