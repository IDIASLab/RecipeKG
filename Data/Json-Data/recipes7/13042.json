Best breadstick recipe I have found!As other suggested I did reduce the sugar because I wanted more of a savory than a  sweet bread. I also added about three-quarter cups extra flour. After waiting five minutes for the yeast and the sugar to foam up then I added the remaining bread ingredients into my KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and put on the hook attachment and let it run for about 6 minutes.  It came out as perfect bread dough. I added fresh rosemary and Italian seasonings to my bread dough. This recipe is very flexible you can add your own seasonings to taste.",

I found I needed to add more flour to make the dough the right consistency, and after putting the toppings on at the end, I put them back in the oven for 1 minute to melt the Parmesan cheese.  Worked great.  Thanks for an easy and delicious bread stick!  So much better than store-bought...I may even try freezing some to have on hand, but I'd need to make another batch.  This first batch didn't last past one meal at my house.  :)",
