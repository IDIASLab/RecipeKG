These are soft pillows of sugar cookie goodness, frosted with the most luxurious creamy, billowy buttercream.  Melt in your mouth, not too sweet and pretty too.  Perfect in my mind.  Except\u2026 it\u2019s a good thing that rolling out sugar cookies isn\u2019t my thing and I had planned to roll these into balls and flatten them all along.  This dough is so soft and so gooey that there is no way you could roll it out if you follow the recipe as written.  And, since the dough is made with shortening, refrigerating it would do nothing to firm it up.  If you are hell bent on rolling these out, you\u2019ll have to add more flour.  A better option?  Just roll these into about 1\u201d balls, roll in sugar, then flatten to about 1/4\u201d with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.  For soft cookies, bake until set but before they begin to turn brown around the edges.",

I agree with the previous reviewer that these cookies are way to sticky to roll so I used a round cookie scoop and dropped them directly onto the cookie sheet. My cookie scoop was quite large so I baked them for 14 minutes while not over baking! They were not at all flat and looked beautiful after frosting and topping with fall sprinkles.",

I really like the texture of the cookies but the amount of butter in the recipe makes them taste a little like corn bread rather than a sugar cookie (maybe increase the vanilla?) - Also as others have said you cannot roll these out unless you've refrigerated the dough for at least an hour. Overall this is a good base recipe for cookies you intend to flavor (orange cinnamon etc) but not as an actual stand-alone sugar cookie.",
