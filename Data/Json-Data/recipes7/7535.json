I did make a few changes as suggested by the users here. I used only 1 cup milk instead of 1.5, 1 cup sugar instead of 0.5 cup, 1 cup flour instead of 1.5, and 1.5 cups corn meal instead of only 1 cup. Reason being, I wanted more corn meal and less bread texture. Anyway, these are simple changes and the results are just wonderful.",

The muffins were moist and had a nice balance of sweetness.  For our taste though the flour to corn meal ratio was a little off.  Although the muffins were very moist - they had more of a biscuit texture inside.  My family missed the texture you get from the extra cornmeal.   I would probably try again, but, do less flour and more cornmeal.  I might even try it with buttermilk instead of milk.   Thanks for the recipe, Karen!",

As suggested in one of the Reviews, I used 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1 cup flour and did not need the entire 11/2 cups of milk.  I thought it would be too soupy.  I did use up some half and half as part of the milk.  This is the most incredible cornbread I have ever made and I have baked a lot over the years.  I just have to stop nibbling on it or it will be gone by dinner time.",
