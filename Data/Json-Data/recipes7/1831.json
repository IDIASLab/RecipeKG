It's a easy way to prepare a shrimp dish that's 'ono' (delicious) and moist!  You can serve this either as an appetizer (pupu) or entree.  I prepare it either with or without the shells on - depending on how fast I want people to eat 'um up! Aloha from Hawaii!!!  Enjoy!",

Everyone there wanted to know how I prepared the shrimps. The shrimps were certainly the hit of the party trumping out all the other dishes. The wives (me being a male) all wanted the recipe. I only use Best Foods Mayonaise and for me the Best oyster Sauce is Lee Kum Kee brand. Thank you iluvpickles for a winner! I guess I will have to make this again next year. The only thing that topped it last evening were the fireworks! All the Best to you!",

Skip the 2 TBS of lemon pepper and instead add 1 TBS  of fresh cracked black pepper and the juice from one fresh lemon.  then take the 1 cup of mayo down to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup of pinapple juice and 1 TBS of fresh minced ginger.  If you want to spice it up, add a tsp of Tabasco. Use all the other ingredients per the original recipe.  Either way, these shrimp come out great!",
