I used 3 eggs instead of 2, since that's where I start all my ice cream bases. When it came to cooking and adding the egg yolks I pulled out all the little white things (i call them the umbilical cords of the egg yolk), wisk them until they're frothy, and then pour the whole heated concoctiom into the egg yolks about a third at a time wisking it continuously and as fast as possible. I've never had a problem with egg yolks or needed to strain them out. Other than that I followed the recipe to a t and it was great. Everyone loved it! I will be making this much more! Oh, and just a tip, this overflowed my 1.5 quart ice cream maker big time. So be careful!",

This recipe, literally took about 12 hours to execute and freeze.  The mixture would not thicken in my ice cream maker.  I had to place the makers frozen container back into the freezer with the mixture still in it.  \nWhile the vanilla ice cream base was rich, smooth, and creamy, the drawback is that when you had fresh mashed ripe bananas it gives the ice cream an icy consistency.\nThis recipe also uses more containers than it should... i.e. one bowl for the base mix, one for the mashed bananas, one pot for the blending, and one to beat the eggs.  \nIt just wasn't a good first recipe to start with, with a new ice cream maker (but not my first).\nHad I not had to cook anything, and could have just thrown all the ingredients into one container or bowl then I would have given it a 5 star rating.  \nstill, it's a good recipe for the more seasoned aficionado if ice cream making.",
