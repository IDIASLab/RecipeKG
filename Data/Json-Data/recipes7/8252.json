The tang of the cranberries combined with the citrus pineapple and sweet whipped topping is delicious with turkey or ham. Always make the day before and just pop in the fridge until dinner time and hope the kids haven't been into it so there's enough for everyone!",

My family has been making it for decades but we don't refrigerate only the sugar and cranberries overnight....we mix in the cranberries marshmallows and pineapple and let it set for about 2-3 hours and then we fold in the fresh heavy whipping cream freshly chopped pecans and I like to use organic maple sugar - makes it even more rich tasting - and then place in refrigerator overnight before serving.",

It's a wonderful alternative to traditional cranberry sauce and is more like a dessert which is why I love it. I'm going to try making it a little differently based on another reviewer whose family got the recipe off the back of a package of cranberries. They let the cranberries sit for a couple of hours then mix everything together and let it sit overnight. The leftovers have always been great so mixing it all together the night before will save a step (and at least a few minutes) on the actual holiday when I'm busy with the rest of the meal. This is a great recipe!",
