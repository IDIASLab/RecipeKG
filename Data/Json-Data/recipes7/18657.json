I followed the recipe other than toasting the coconut along with the pecans and pricking the shortbread before baking it. My only complaint is that there is WAY too much to go in an 8x8 pan. My bars were very very thick and there was so much topping that about half of it couldn't stick to the dulce de leche and it was wasted since it fell off. Cooking this in a larger pan would be a much better idea and solve the problem- or even keeping the pan size the same to keep the thick bottom crust and cutting back on the topping so it all sticks. These are super rich I'd recommend cutting into bites rather than bars. The flavor is fabulous!",
