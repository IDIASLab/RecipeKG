This dessert has been an Easter tradition in my family since before my father was born.  The recipe makes a lot, but it can easily be cut in half for smaller groups. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top of the cheesecakes before baking if desired.",

If you use real vanilla extract, you'll want to use a little less.  Also, this cheesecake freezes very well, so you can make a full recipe and just freeze the extra pies for eating at a later date.  One BIG tip - if you're wanting a cheesecake with a flavor and texture like those made with cream cheese, please keep looking, because this recipe isn't for you.  If you're open to a new twist on cheesecake, then I encourage you to enjoy this delicious recipe!",

My brother-in-law is Italian and his parents' eyes lit up when they realized I had brought a ricotta cheesecake - no it's not like what most of us expect a \"cheesecake\" to be like but as far as a ricotta pie-type dessert this was the best one ever. Scaled down to one pie and I had no lemon to zest so added a drop of lemon extract and a bit of orange zest along with the lime zest. Less rich less sweet than the typical cheesecake but delicious! This will be a definite repeat in our house!",
