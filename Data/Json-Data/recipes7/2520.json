Thanks for the recipe though I would not have thought of this combination. Just needs a little tweaking for my tastes. Take care!",

The basil is not overpowering but a very nice complement to the fruit in this drink. Sometimes it is hard to find peach nectar or somtimes it is bland or kind of metallic tasting when you buy it in a can so we used half mango nectar and half peach. I served it with cheap magnum sized bottles of chardonnay (nothing too sweet) and it was great. Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe. Nicest thing about it was we had leftover syrup from this recipe and I put it in a mason jar in the fridge and continued to make it a glass at a time after the party. So yummy!",
