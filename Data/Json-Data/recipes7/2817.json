This was the first pie I have ever baked from scratch (I used the No Fail Pie Crust recipe) and it came out better than anything my parents have ever made. My dad said it rivaled my grandmothers so I know it has something going for it. The vanilla and maple syrup add interesting notes of flavor. In summary great tasting and easy to make. I loved it.",

Now this is the only apple pie recipe I use for my family. I made this recipe twice. Once with pie crust on top and once with a crumb topping. Both ways are excellent!
