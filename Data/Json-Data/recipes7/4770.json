I tried this recipe, and although good, it's not Mexican Jamaica, it heavily resembles that from Puerto Rico.",

This was simple to make and very inexpensive (about $3.00 for a gallon, compared to $3.49 for a 32-ounce cup at the store).  This is less sweet and syrupy than the jamaica at the store, too, and that makes me like it even more.  Thanks for a great recipe that I'll make many times!",

We Bajans just brew the petals with a cinnamon stick and plenty of sugar! Back home in NY the hibiscus petals (flors des Jamaica) were quite easy to find in any one of the myriad indigenous markets in town. (Used to be able to buy a sorrel syrup concentrate too if you couldn't find the petals.) Here in Nashville we have to look a little harder for Mexican or international markets; but it's not impossible to find -- and well worth the trouble once you get the end result!",
