I did use day old french bread I had on hand, sliced and cubed it up. Everything else I followed. It baked and smelled quite nice. My husband loves corn but doesn't like cream style corn. Was even surprised after he promised to try it. He enjoyed this very much. The rice cereal was a total plus in my book. I might use the idea of butter rice cereal on a few recipes in place of corn flakes. Will make again. Thank you.",
