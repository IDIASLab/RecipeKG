What are the approximate dimensions of the logs? After the first baking and cutting, do you put the cookies on the pan cut side up or not? The baking time is pretty vague for the second baking.   I have been baking for sixty years, have made biscotti a few times (although it is not one of my regulars) so I figured this stuff out, but a novice would have difficulty with these directions. As for the cookie itself, next time I will not put in the mint chocolate chips. If  I add anything, it will be candy cane Kisses that I chop up. Biscotti is labor intensive, but these are worth a try.",
