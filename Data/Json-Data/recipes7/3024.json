I did not add the additional sugar to any of the four apples and I used dried blueberries only because I didn't have any dried cranberries. I used Pinata apples which are very sweet on their own baking them only made them sweeter which made me glad I didn't add the sugar. The only person who did not like this dessert was my husband. The kids and I REALLY liked ours. Great low-calorie dessert that was simple to make with on hand ingredients. I'm SO making this again.",

I am not a big fan of baked apples unless they are very sweet so I came across this recipe and liked the combination of Cranberries and apples. I made a couple changes. First being that I made it for 3 apples instead of just 1 so I tripled all ingredients. I have no nutmeg so I substituted 1 tsp. of dark brown sugar to make the apple sweeter. I also had no dried cranberries on hand so I used a Tlbsp. of canned cranberries. Everything else I followed including cooking times. The family LOVED these. They were perfectly sweet topped with some cool whip and some of the extra sugar mixture on top to make it look pretty. I am going to try some oats on top or graham cracker crumbs to give it a different texture because I am a huge fan of apple crisp. All in all this is an EXTREMELY simple and delicious dish that can be thrown together quickly and is something the kids can help with. It cooked while we ate dinner. Just great.",

A couple of other reviewers mentioned texture problems with the filling; I did not have that problem. The filling was creamy rich and oozed deliciously over the tender apple flesh; broken open with a spoon. Next time I may hollow out a slightly larger cavity in the apple sacrificing a little bit of apple flesh to have more room for filling.",
