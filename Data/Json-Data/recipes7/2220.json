I used the basic idea of this recipe for ingredients but made frozen yogurt rather than ice cream. My variation: 4 cups whole milk Greek yogurt 3/4 cup white sugar 2 cups candied walnuts (I did not have black walnuts) 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt. I mixed all together poured into bowl of ice cream maker to freeze. DELICIOUS. Definitely sweet enough and rich enough for our taste. I will probably try making it with low fat or nonfat yogurt next time.",
