When trying to leave a rating i realized i had to become a member so i did just to leave a rating to give Tom the credit that he well deserves for this recipe. I have always been a sweet pimento cheese lover. Its hard to find a good one on the internet. I dont understand why more people have not left ratings for this award winning cheese. Out of five stars i would rate this at least a 10. Yes its that good. Thanks again Tom!!!!!!!",
