I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it was just too sweet for my taste. The second time, I reduced the carrots to 1.5 cups, increased the bean sprouts to 1 cup, left out the sweetener, doubled the coconut, added more cilantro, and increased the mustard seed to 1 tb. It was much more flavorful and less carroty-sweet. Next time, I'll add just a little bit more mustard seed--it's the one ingredient that really gives this recipe its unique flavor and shouldn't be left out. I'll definitely keep this one with the mods. It's a beautiful salad, too.",

Used the pre-jullienne carrots in the bag and fresh bean sprouts from the farmers market. Great!",
