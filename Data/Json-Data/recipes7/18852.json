Then I moved to Seattle, where nobody had heard of them! I couldn't find a decent recipe online. Everything I tried didn't turn out as fluffy, sweet, and heavenly as the kolaches I know and love. I cobbled together this recipe for what I think is the perfect sausage kolache.",

The recipe made 36 oz of dough I divided into 20 portions, 1.8oz each, that I flattened into 3\" x 3\" squares and wrapped around 1.5\" lengths of fully cooked chicken breakfast sausage and 0.2oz of shredded cheddar cheese. The dough wrapped sausages were then placed seam side down and evenly spaced on a parchment lined baking sheet, left to rest for 30 minutes, then baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.",

I had a couple of small changes to my recipe.  I used a bread machine and I used oil instead of the butter. I made two types and both kinds were good.  One had sausage and cheese and the other sausage, sauerkraut and cheese.  For the sausage and cheese I used half of full polish sausage. For the ones with sauerkraut, I used 1/4 of a polish sausage. I rolled each dough piece into a rectangle and then added the filling and completely pinched it all closed - similar to the pictures.  I will definitely be making these again!",

The first time I made this I added all the flour at once and ruined the batch, because it was too stiff and dry. I ended up using 1 full cup less flour than what is called for. \n-I used ground sausage, eggs and cheese, and would recommend weighing the finished dough, and then dividing by the number of desired kolaches. I did not do this, and my sizes ended up all over the place. Ended up with 25, roughly baseball size, and used .75 lbs ground sausage (Tbs per kolache), 7 medium scrambled eggs (tsp per kolache). \nAll in all, very popular with friends and family, and will make again and again.",
