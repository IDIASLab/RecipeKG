I let the chicken sit in the sauce overnight and I think that helped a lot!!! The pineapple maybe should be saved to put in only 10 minutes before time to eat. My pineapple was a bit too soggy from being in the sauce baking for nearly 30 minutes.",

Only 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup white sugar, dried chopped onion instead of fresh, and for the pineapple I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple slices, used all of the juice in the teriyaki sauce, and then cut the slices into chunks.  I added the pineapple chunks to the sauce after thickening it before adding to the chicken.  And I poured the sauce over the chicken all at one time and then basted while baking.  The sauce was SO good over rice!",

I was running out of time to wait for everything to thicken so I threw it all into the same pan and cooked it all together so I'd have a bit of a sauce to put with the rice I was making! Delish!",

I also did not have cornstarch pineapple chunks onion or fresh ginger -- I substituted a tropical mixed fruit cup onion powder and ground ginger. I added a pinch of flour instead of cornstarch to see if it would compare -- not really. But the flavor was delicious!! I cooked it longer than it said b/c it just didn't look done and I also cut the oven up to 425 at that point. I think next time I'll cook it at 400 or so anyway for the time directed.:) Great recipe thanks for sharing!!",
