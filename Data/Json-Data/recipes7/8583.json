This is simply prepared and decadently delicious.  And I do mean decadent - it is heavy, creamy and rich, and I enjoyed every last bite of this right down to the last drop of sauce on my plate.  As it turned out, the sugar, small amount that it was, was indeed not necessary - the onions provided sweetness of their own, so adding any extra sugar would not have benefited the dish at all.  As the sauce was simmering those last few minutes, I added in some frozen, raw shrimp, not because I felt the dish required it but just because I felt like it.  To give it some color and freshness I gave it a sprinkle of fresh parsley.  I\u2019ll fret about all the \u201cbad\u201d things I ate tonight (calories, fat, carbs) tomorrow.  For now, I\u2019m just gonna revel in the fact that I just enjoyed a very good meal.",

A tip - make sure the heat isn't \"boiling\" hot when you complete Step 1 (cooking the onions / garlic). Note the instructions say LOW heat... if you cook them at too high a temperature they'll go bitter. Do it right and boy this is heaven - we always make double the recipe so we have leftovers and my office mates are always JEALOUS!!",
