The batch size is a little small for the dough hook so I finished kneading by hand. I liked the idea of adding gluten instead of mixing the whole wheat flour with bread flour. The result was a nice whole grain taste and an excellent texture. I did not use the egg wash but might try next time as the I prefer a crustier bagel. I may also try boiling them a bit longer to see if that helps to develop a chewier crust.",
