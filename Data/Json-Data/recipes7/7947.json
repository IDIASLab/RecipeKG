My oven temperature is correct as I put a thermometer inside and also had baked a pie two days prior. Sorry to say Allrecipes but this one is not a keeper. I have made many of your recipes and always good so I am not sure what happened here.",

I just didn't find this as rich as the description says and it's a rather soft bar I expected something firmer for portability. It was certainly easy to make.",
