The yield was much higher than what the recipe had said so I ended up having to bake the first batch of shortbread allow them to cool briefly and then do the other batch of crusts. Then I baked half the cheesecakes waited about an hour before I removed them (carefully) from the pan and then baked the other half. I didn't have a shot glass to push the shortbread crusts down but the key limes I was using were just the right size and they worked great. Also a few hints about the raspberry: Mix the preserves before you start adding them to the cheesecake. They'll be much easier to work with. Also the cheesecakes look better if you use less raspberry rather than more. Just a small drop is enough to add color and the raspberry taste.",

I made these with regular limes (couldn't find any key limes) and baked them in regular sized muffin cups. I served them with a dollop of whipped cream which both tasted good and hid any imperfections in the attractiveness of the raspberry swirl. I don't think you really need quite as much raspberry preserves as the recipe calls for but other than that it is great as is.",

The directions are just a little vague as it states it makes 24 but says to use 2 mini-muffin pans. My pans each hold 24. The filling seemed like way too much so after looking at other mini cheesecake recipes and asking on the RE I decided to make 2/3 of the filling recipe. That worked out just right. I had fresh raspberries on hand so I cooked 6 oz with 3/4 cup sugar and 1 TBSP cornstarch. I used this in place of the preserves. Very tasty!",

This is what drove up the price of this recipe I think. Sandies would have been much cheaper. Anyways- took me 3 tries to get the cooking time on this one right. In regular muffin tins it took right about 18 Minutes. Good luck!",
