I think the issue is the description on \"one butternut squash\" The butternut squash I had after paring was close to 2 1/2 pounds of squash.. the description shows this to feed 2 people so I cannot imagine anyone being able to eat a pound and 1/4 of butternut. I didn't even put the full amount of squash in as it seemed like way too much for the amount of bacon. So I will make this again but adjust the squash amount or add more bacon or sausage and some heat",

I julienned the kale and added it along with some minced garlic after crisping the bacon (and draining all but 2 tbls. of the fat) then added the squash and a dash of white balsamic vinegar. Fantastic side or main dish!",
