I was hoping that I could find one that I could add diced pears to, as I  couldn't find a Pear/Banana Bread recipe. This was the one. What I did was half the amount of the bananas and add a can of drained, diced pears. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of using the different spices called for in this recipe. Yum. This impressed my husband, who normally dosen't care for banana bread. I'll for sure be making this again. Thanks for posting the recipe.",

Bunt muffins were done in about 23 minutes.\n So Good!",

I only had 3 bananas but I thought it still turned out phenomenal. Also I did as a couple other reviewers suggested and did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I will be making this again and again!",
