I now make several batches every years at several peoples request. It has become a huge hit at bake sales as well. Don't be afraid of the fact that it has habanero peppers in the recipe. The heat is very subtle and just adds to the flavor of the jam. It's also great spread over a block of cream cheese served with crackers for an easy appetizer for parties. Try it instead of sugar in your baked bean recipe and you will not be disappointed.",

I made this in August when the peaches were ripe and while my husband liked it, it was just too Christmassy tasting to me.  Couldn't really taste the peaches at all (and they were fantastic as I peeled and nibbled).  Also, the directions say to boil the pectin, add sugar, then boil again.  This is the opposite of what the pectin packets say (boil sugar first then add pectin, then boil again), and processing for 15 minutes was too long even at 5,000 feet, so the result is 11 jars of peach habanero sauce.  We will use it, but it isn't jellified.  Oh, and one final note ... I had never handled habanero peppers before.  I didn't wear gloves to de-seed them and about an hour later I scratched my eye with my fingernail.  It took an hour of flushing my eyes with saline and milk before the pain went away.  Totally my fault, just be careful.  Holy cow that was a painful lesson to learn.  I will try the recipe  again but next time without as much allspice and I will follow the directions on the pectin packs so that these set and will update.  Probably next year.  Good luck!",

I'll still use it because the flavor is wonderful, but I'm suspecting that it is the cooking method (adding the pectin before the sugar), that is the reason why this did not set up properly. I was tempted to do it the way that it says on the pectin package, but I wanted to stay true to the recipe. I'm still giving this 4 stars, b/c, like I said, it is delicious and had a really nice, flavor with a nice, spicy kick, which we enjoyed. If I try this again, I will follow the cooking method on the pectin package. Thanks for sharing. :)",

I love cardamom so always have it around. That flavor crept through just like I had hoped it would. This is a great recipe and I was happy to supply a photo. Thanks Kiki!",
