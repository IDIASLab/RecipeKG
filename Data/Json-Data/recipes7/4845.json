I left the husks intact (peeling them back a little and removing a bit of excess silk) because that's how I grill them so the corn basically stems inside the husk.  I'm not sure if we had really good corn or if it was the soak, but my husband looked up at me and said he wished we'd grilled more corn.  So, we have a winner here and this will be how we soak our corn from now on.....",

The only reason I can even give 2 stars is for the grilling. Grilled corn is the best, but I will go back to how I usually do it. I wrap the cleaned cobs in foil with a few small butter pats inside each. The only down side is that you cannot see how they are cooking and when they are done. If you get the right timing down with your grill, they are incredible, though.",
