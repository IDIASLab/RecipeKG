So I'm a little biased..\nThis was the first time I had ever made a pecan pie.  I followed his recipe almost exactly, and was blown away! Amazing!!\n\nMy only 'issue' was something that I brought on to myself- I didn't have the pie weights that Chef John used in the video, nor did I substitute with dried beans or rice.  Instead, I followed the instructions on the ready-made crust packaging, which told me to use a fork to puncture the crust prior to baking.  Not good! It totally messed with the integrity of the crust, and did nothing to prevent the crust from bubbling up.\nNext time, I will use pie weights, or beans, or rice, or whatever!\nThe pie didn't slice quite as nicely as Chef John's, but that could be because I didn't let it cool completely.  BUT- warm, gooey Pecan Pie from the oven totally trumps proper plating.",
