This was a solid bar and I proudly brought some of them to a mommies group while sending some to my husbands work.  The gals and I all agreed it stands about a 3.  The consensus was to add more blueberries and some almond extract to the cream cheese mixture--then add some nuts to the crust.  Overall I wasn't wild about the flavor of the crust, not sure if it was the flour or what.  They were very easy to make and definitely have the \"from scratch\" vibe.  Overall a -good- recipe.",

Changes made: No wheat flour just regular for crust. 1/4 cup more oats 2 tbsp more butter for crust. Added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the crust. No lemon zest so added 1/2 tbsp lemon juice extra. Added about 1/2 cup more blueberries. Didn't have the patience to let it set up so the middle is a bit squishier than I would like but it tastes AMAZING. Will make again and again....",

Though it's more of a dessert and I made it with the intention of having it as a granola bar in the morning. The only thing I would suggest is adding maybe 1/4 cup more oats and when baking it at the end baking it for about 35-40 minutes. Thanks for sharing!!",

I used the dough blade in my Cuisinart food processor to make the crust. Pressed into the bottom of my lined and lightly greased pan baked for 12 minutes and then allowed the crust to cool. Poured filling into crust and baked for exactly 30 minutes. I allowed to cool on the counter for about 10 minutes and then placed in the refrigerator for an hour. Such an easy delicious recipe worthy of five stars! Thank you CountryGirlGourmet for sharing your recipe for Blueberry Oat Dream Bars!",
