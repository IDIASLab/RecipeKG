I agree on the desire for a nice sweet chili but it should be arrived at through slightly more natural means. as for salt perhaps the original chef intended for some of the original ingredients to be salted at the onset. Barring dietary restrictions this recipe will improve dramatically with pitches of salt across the board. Consider garnishing with fresh cilantro and queso fresco for a southwestern flare!",
