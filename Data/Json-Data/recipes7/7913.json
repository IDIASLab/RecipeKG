Use the best quality cinnamon you can get and get it from a spice merchant or even a store where you can get it bulk; it does make a difference. Within ten minutes of going in the oven the scent will fill the house and neighbors you loaned things to years ago will return them just to invite themselves in and wonder aloud if there is any left (Note: there isn't). Optional accompaniments would be caramel sauce, ice cream, and whipped cream.",

While the oven was preheating, I melted a few tablespoons of butter in the skillet, then layered the apple mixture over the melted butter, then sprinkled the topping over the apple mixture. My apple crisp looked like something you'd see on the cover of a fancy magazine and the flavor took me back to when I was little and eating my Grandma's apple crisp. VERY good and for me, very soul-soothing dish.",

                "reviewBody": "When working with fresh fruit you often find that the most simple of recipes really highlight the fruit's flavor.  This recipe does just that.  I did add two more ingredients and changed the method a bit but I tried to stay true to the recipe and I wasn't disappointed.  \n\nI started by choosing six different types of baking apples.  A combination of apples gives you lots of flavor and textures.  I peeled, cored and chopped the apples and tossed them with the sugar and cinnamon.  Because many of the apples I chose have high water contents I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of dry minute tapioca.  Even if you don't care for tapioca you wouldn't even know it was in there.  It thickens up the apple's juices and ensures no soggy apple mess.  I also added some fresh ground nutmeg.  Only because I love nutmeg and apples.\n\nFor the crunch topping I changed the method.  I really enjoy a crunchy top that isn't sandy so I used softened butter rather than melted butter.  I started by mixing the dry ingredients and then used my hands to work the butter into it.  The end result is a beautiful pea shaped crumb topping.  Then I baked as directed.  \n\nIt really is a fantastic recipe and one I will make again and again.",

Minor modifications: added an extra teaspoon of both cinnamon and sugar to apples along with some lemon juice and 2TBS of flour.  To the topping only used 3/4 brown sugar, any more would have been too much and we like things sweet.  Cooking time took 50 minutes and since I kept the apples on the chunky side, I didn't have to worry about them being mushing.  Served with a drizzle of caramel sauce toped with whipped cream.",

I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the oatmeal mix. Also, the topping really does stay crispy, unlike many apple crisp recipes. Just a quick tip, I mixed all of the dry ingredients in a food processor and that significantly reduced the mixing time. Put the oatmeal in last so that it does not get too chopped up. I also believe that the brown sugar could be reduced from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and the butter from 8 tablespoons to 6 tablespoons just to make it a little lighter. We got 8 servings out of this rather than 4. I highly recommend this recipe with or without my modifications! This is the tastiest apple crisp I've ever made!",

I did have to bake it for about an hour.  It may be my oven which is gas and I am not use to it yet.  If your fruit does not hold together as you would like, just add one tablespoon of cornstarch to the sugar and cinnamon before you mix it with the apples.  I also like nutmeg and a few grates of whole nutmeg in the apples and the crust adds to the flavor.",
