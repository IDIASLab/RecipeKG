The custard though delicious needs that bit of sweetness in my opinion. I also added a bit of nutmeg as I feel all custards should have a bit of nutmeg. I made this recipe in a springform pan and it turned out wonderfully!",

I felt like it was super sweet and the crust was a little dry. However when I tried it the next day I really enjoyed it. The sweetness of the fruit layer blended more with the crust and the custard. The crust absorbed a little of the moisture of the top layers too and it was very yummy. I used frozen sliced peaches and they worked great they were done just right with the suggested cooking time.",
