I made it following the instructions given and it was orangey and yummy. I discarded the insides and used the peels as directed mincing them as much as I could in a small food processor and then in my blender. The ice cream had small bits of peel reminding me of the texture of coconut. I m only giving four stars for that reason (perhaps an extra good blender like a vitamix would work to get a completely smooth paste). I would make again!",
