The amount of cornstarch was concerning to me while making this and it explains the goopy texture of the filling layer that was produced. It was as if it is trying to be some sort of shelf stable store bought product. The lemon wasn\u2019t detectable to the degree expected for a recipe to have lemon in the title. The topping could use some flavouring like nutmeg to combat the blah of this cobbler. This is a fail recipe on so many levels for me.",
