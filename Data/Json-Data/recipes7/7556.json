I'm now wishing that I made the whole recipe b/c I can't stop eating it lol. After tasting it my first thought was crackers w/ cream cheese and this on top...AWESOME! I also plan on trying this on hot dogs/smoked sausages and grilled chicken which I think would be wonderful. When this first started to boil/cook I was worried b/c the tomato skins were coming off and I thought I should've peeled them first but once it was all done everything was 'candied' and you couldn't even tell. Mine took less than an hour to fully thicken so maybe just keep an eye on it while it's going so it doesn't burn. I will def be making this often...it's super easy and super good YUM!

As it was cooking down I drizzled some over grilled zucchini and \"Oh MY!\" I think I will add some chili powder next time just for my taste and cut back the sugar a little more so it is a little more savory.

The smell at first was a little odd to me, as I'm pregnant, but once it started really cooking down, I found myself tasting it and loving every different stage more and more. \n\nI look forward to making more this sunday for my husband to take to the teacher's lounge on monday. I am sure we will get more great reviews then. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. :)",

Made it exactly as the recipe except reduced the bacon to 3 strips (that's what I had on hand). I would reduce the sugar a bit because of the sweeter tomatoes and would up the amount of bacon but I will absolutely make this again. And again. Try it on toasted french bread with a smear of goat cheese topped with the jam. Yummy!",

I mostly followed the recipe except: first I doubled it with a pound of bacon which turned out to be fortunate because everyone loved it. Since there are no nice fresh tomatoes to be had at this time of year I used three 24 oz. cans of whole peeled tomatoes. I did NOT double the sugar only used one cup. And finally I whirled the whole shebang briefly in the food processor because I thought it would look nicer - there remained some unappealing-looking lumps of the fatty part of the bacon even though I cooked it very well. My finished product though slightly different from the original recipe was a huge hit - simply served on crackers. But almost everyone felt that it was maybe just a tad too sweet (even at half the sugar). So I will definitely make it again but put less sugar (I'll try 3/4 cup with the double recipe) and I will also throw in a handful of oil cured sun-dried tomato to up the savory content. I think then it will be insanely good. (One final thought you cook this for so long that I don't think I would ever bother starting with good fresh tomatoes - I'd rather use them for something where they stay closer to their natural state. It's so much easier to use canned and still tastes great.)",

I think I am going to try it without any sugar next time or maybe just a Tablespoon of sugar and add more at the end if it needs it. I also would use a small onion or only 1/2 an onion. The recipe has a lot of potential.",
