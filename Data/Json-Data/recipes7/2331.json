Even following the directions of using paper towel to drain excess juice from the strawberries I still had to keep adding more flour in order to be able to knead it.  I must have added at a minimum about 1/2 cup of flour.  I did so a little at a time as I was feeling for it to become the right consistency to allow kneading.  The end result was delicious!",

I didn't have cream or lemons on hand the first time I made them, so I substituted 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt for the cream and vanilla (second time used 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt).  This also made them a bit healthier.  In place of the lemon zest, I added a little lemon juice to the powdered sugar glaze I made.  The dough was very crumbly when I dumped it onto the counter because yogurt is thicker than cream.  It didn't mix in as well, so I had to mix it by hand on the counter to make sure the moisture was evenly distributed.   I made these for my wife for Mother's Day breakfast, and she LOVED them.",

The strawberries you use directly effect the outcome! If you have very ripe sweet berries you will get a wet and yummy dough if you get some that rea not so ripe you will have less trouble with moisture but the taste will not be as good. My final solution was to use a combination of dried strawberries and dried strawberry flavored crasins. YUM! Also faboo with dried blueberries. (Be sure to mince them a bit so they are not so big.)",
