My biggest gripe is that it is out of balance and has no depth of flavor. I would rate it just ok. It needs help. \n\nIt was a good base to start with and by the time I got done tweaking  it was good. However, it bore very little resemblance to the original recipe. \n\nIf I was ever to make it again, I would use brown sugar because it adds depth and makes a better barbeque style sauce. I didn't use the entire teaspoon of Cayenne to begin with because we don't like things really hot and that would have been fiery (I used 1/2), but it needed depth so I added cumin, smoked paprika, coriander, ground mustard and garam marsala. I also added some extra white vinegar and fresh lemon peel for some brightness and to balance out all the sweetness. It turned out good in the long run, but it took a bit to get it there.  As is the sauce tastes really sweet and hot, but lacks any real depth of flavor and has absolutely no balance. It needs some smokiness that the paprika brings and some balance in acidity and sweetness.   \n\nThanks for sharing the recipe. Sorry I didn't care for it much.  (P.S. This says I've made it twice  -i've only made it once).",
