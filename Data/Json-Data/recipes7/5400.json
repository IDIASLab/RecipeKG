I've made a lot of banana breads on this site and this is one of the better recipes. I cut the recipe in half as I only needed one bread but I wish I'd made two! I used butter-flavored shortening, added a little more banana, and used low-fat buttermilk and sour cream. I did add a bit of cinnamon and next time I think I might add in some walnuts or chocolate chips - and believe me there will definitely be a next time! This bread was very moist (ya just gotta love baking with buttermilk), rich and delicious. Oh so good warm out of the oven with a bit of butter. Thanks for a great recipe AMHORSCH!",

I made this today with my older boy only substituting whole wheat white flour for the regular flour and cutting the white sugar back to a scant 1/2 cup. I made 12 large-ish muffins for us as snacks and three \"gift\" loaves for friends (random acts of kindness!). This banana bread is one of the best we've ever had. Really, REALLY to die for! I hate to make it lighter because it's really freaking yummy but next time, I might cut the butter and oil back by half and add more mashed banana. NOTE: To prevent a tough banana bread, I always wisk together all my dry ingredients (including sugar) and all my wet ingredients and then fold the dry into the wet until just moistened making sure not to overmix. You get perfect quick bread/muffins every time. EDITED: I've now made this recipe twice and not only does my family love it, but so do the six people we've made gift loaves for. Thanks!",

Busy adding all ingredients and did not add cinnamon or nutmeg, which I usually do. No buttermilk in house so mixed my own using 2 cups whole milk to which I added 1/2 TBSP of white vinegar. Used 1 cup in recipe, storing remaining cup in frig in covered container. Bread is golden brown, but texture was not dense. Next time, I will add 2-3 more bananas for greater flavor. HINT: Definitely use a large bowl for banana mix; by end of mixing bowl will be full. Loaf pans were 3/4 full so I put them on top of a cookie sheet to avoid spillovers. Cake rose 1/2-inch below top rack. After eating 1 warm piece, I placed each loaf in a plastic bag and left loaves on countertop overnight. Had a room temp slice with late breakfast; doesn't tickle my taste buds so will heat some before eating next time. Normally, I freeze banana bread but freezer went out so am storing loaves in the frig, leaving in bags. Enjoy!",
