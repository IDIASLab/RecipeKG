Apparently, a previous reviewer and her daughter used cornmeal, if the texture was like a tortilla.\n\nSecond, in answer to the other previous reviewer who was confused about the 3/4c. and 1 1/2c. confectioner\u2019s sugar amounts: if you read the recipe, you\u2019ll see they are two separate amounts listed and used at two separate times for two separate purposes in this recipe.  Always read your recipe completely through several times before starting, and have all ingredients and tools mise en placed so that everything runs smoothly.  With baking and confectionery, timing and exact measurements are essential, as is following to a \u201cT\u201d the exact instructions.  Fumbling around and measuring as you go is a guarantee for failure.\n\nThird, depending on the wattage of tbe microwave used to make this recipe, the time it takes to bloom the gelatin will vary widely.  It can take as little as four and as many as twelve minutes.  You must carefully watch your mixture and use common sense.\n\nFinally, if your finished product \u201csweats\u201d or seeps, it was not cooked long enough and did not cure long enough before cutting and tossing in the confectioner\u2019s sugar/cornstarch coating.  Turkish Delight should really rest a minimum of 24 hours, and up to 2 days, covered with plastic wrap, before being cut and finished.  And storing it in tbe refrigerator is a guarantee that your candy will become sticky a",

I know rose flavor can be divisive like black licorice (you either love it or you hate it).\n\nI agree with another reviewer that the rose could be slightly increased, though I made it with the suggested measure, and it was just fine. When I tried the powdered sugar dusted cubes, I thought the sugar flavor overwhelmed too much. I, instead, covered the finished jellies in finely ground almond flour. The resulting nutty forward, rose finish is absolutely delectable. \n\nThe instructions were simple and effective. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
