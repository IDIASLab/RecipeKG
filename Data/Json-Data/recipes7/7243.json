Saw this one while browsing today and thought it would be a perfect cold-buster. Not only did both of my kids (sick) love it and eat multiple helpings, my husband and I (healthy) thought it was awesome too. I did scale back the ginger and garlic by not adding it at the end because I figured my daughter wouldn't appreciate it - she did say it was a little ginger strong - but I thought a bit more would have been a perfect finish. One thing I changed was I used 2/3 chicken \"Better than Bullion\" and 1/3 beef \"Better than Bullion\" because it was what I had on hand. Still was quite tasty and will make it again.",

My husband and I each had a bowl for dinner my baby had a baby-sized bowl I froze half of the remaining batch in ice cube trays to serve my son for lunch in the future and there is still plenty for at least a day or two of lunches for me and my husband.",
