Step # 2 wasn't possible as the dough was more like a thin batter so I decided to treat it as a no knead and let it sit overnight about 13 hours. For step three I used a bench scraper until there was enough flour added to work the dough I then kneaded the dough for 10 minutes and let it rise for four hours. Nice texture but probably not something that I'll make again.",
