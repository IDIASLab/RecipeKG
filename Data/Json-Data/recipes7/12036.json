I had made awesome fudge with Hersey s sea salt caramel baking chips and condensed milk. I was hopeful with this because the sea salt caramel chips are hard to find. Right off the consistency of the evaporative milk was too liquidy.. I continued on and did each step. After all was done I poured the mixture into a dish wth parchment paper and let it cool. After a couple hours it was still not fudge. So I put it in the fridge overnight. The next day I took I it out and tried to slice the 'fudge.' It was taffy like and incredibly sticky. More like caramel with more stick. I ate a few pieces and declared it destined for the trash. Sorry. In the future I will only use condensed milk and caramel baking chips. Sorry.",
