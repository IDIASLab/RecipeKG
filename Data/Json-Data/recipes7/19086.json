                "reviewBody": "1.26.19 First this recipe has a LOT of ingredients and a LOT of steps so I m not convinced that it s really that much easier in an Instant Pot. I ve made quite a few Instant Pot recipes and this was the most time consuming and involved so plan your time accordingly. I made sure to not cut my beef cubes too small but in spite of that most of the beef cubes simply fell apart shredded. I think 45 minutes is too long for this recipe and if I ever decide to make this again I would try 30-35 minutes. The one thing that I would not include again are the diced potatoes. I ve never had potatoes in beef bourguignon but I'm willing to try just about anything but they pretty much turned to mush. Simply put this really tasted like beef stew with red wine. I did add a little cornstarch slurry to thicken and added some saut\u00e9ed mushrooms at the end. I have a tasty recipe for slow cooker beef bourguignon which I ll probably stick with. This was OK but for the effort involved just expected a little more.",
