The cake is more like a brownie and the whole thing tastes very much like the candy bar. I made the recipe exactly as written, the only change I might make in the future is the make the coconut layer a little creamier instead of so dry, but it's still delicious. Thank you for the recipe, I will add this to my permanent recipe box.",
