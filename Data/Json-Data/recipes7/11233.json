I made it for my coworkers, and everyone who has taken a piece has come back to my desk to tell me how wonderful this bread pudding is.\n\nI made a few changes, because I had to.\n1. Used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (I didn't thaw them, just threw them in with the bread)\n2. I substituted 3 tablespoons aguafaba (bean juice - google it) for one egg, because I only had two eggs left\n3. I baked for 40 minutes.\n\nNext time, I will make sure I have all the proper ingredients on hand :)  Thank you for sharing your recipe Beth!",

I had to add 1 more tbs of softened butter than the recipe called for to get it to cream together and I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. In my opinion it almost doesn't need the \"golden sauce\" as it is pretty sweet on it's own. Overall a good recipe and I will certainly make it again. Thanks!",
