I used 1/2 tsp lemon juice instead of a lemon (added with the water) and halved 8 ripe apricots instead of the peach.  I also changed the cooking method, after browning the chicken, I put it in a dish in a medium oven whilst I made the sauce, according to the recipe, up to addding the water when I also added the apricots.  All this warm sauce was poured over the browned drumsticks and baked for around half an hour.  The sauce thickened in the oven so I didn't use any cornflour. The chicken was so juicy and the flavor beautifully ballanced, not too much of any one.",

I added a tablespoon of cornstarch instead of a teaspoon and liked the consistency of the sauce that I got. The peaches we had on hand were pretty small so I used two instead of one. When I reheated the leftovers on the stove the next day I cooked a little extra sauce and added more peach since we had eaten most of the fruit when we ate the dish fresh. This brought out the peach flavour nicely. Thanks for a great recipe! I will be making this again. Edit: The second time I made this I used 2 regular sized peaches - I was glad I did. They were not overpowering but gave a nice flavour. I put in 1 tsp of cornstarch like the recipe calls for. I found the sauce very runny and will be sure to use 1 Tbsp in the future. Even though the sauce didn't thicken like I hoped it would we still really enjoyed the meal.",
