I had a plain sirloin pork roast that i was cooking and wanted to do something different. since there was no bone I wanted there to be some juice for it to be moist. Oh my goodness is this the best! I had no time to do the bacon part so skipped that I had no tomatoe paste so used extra tomatoe sauce and used dried parsley instead of fresh otherwise followed directions exactly. my picky 9 yr old loved it as did myself and my husband. This is a fabulous way to prepare pork and I recommend it for anyone who reads these do not be shy that only 10 people have rated this!!",

I cooked the mushrooms in half a cup of red wine until they were soft and then put them in a bowl along with another cup of red wine the garlic parsley 1/4 tsp salt pepper tomato paste and sugar. I then browned the chops in a little bit of olive oil and poured the mixture over them. Cooked it all on medium low heat for about 20-30 minutes. The chops were extremely tender and flavorful. I was really impressed how the red wine tenderized the meat. I ll have to try it with a roast some time. Thanks!",

I used a slow cooker with a 2.5lb roast cooking it for 6 hours (adding mushrooms at the beginning rather than waiting until the end of cooking). The meat was very tender juicy and flavorful. I cut up a couple pieces of the bacon after frying and added them to the sauce. The only red wine I had was a shiraz which worked just fine. I also used cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end and we served it over spaetzle noodles along with a freshly baked Light Oat Bread (found on this site). We will definitely be making this again and again!",
