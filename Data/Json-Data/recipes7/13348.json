Out of necessity I had to use two teaspoons of pumpkin spice instead of the individual measures of cloves nutmeg and allspice since I did not have all of these individual spices on hand. I reduced the amount of water to 1/2 cup since I made these in the middle of a sweltering extreme Southern California heat wave. In cooler months I may find that the amount of liquid stated in the recipe (3/4 cups) is just perfect since flour will absorb more water in colder climates. I am looking forward to making these bagels for the holidays with fresh pumpkins and sharing with family and friends!:-)",

                "reviewBody": "Flavor-wise these bagels are delicious. Could stand to be a touch sweeter--like an extra tablespoon or two of brown sugar. Technique-wise these were not the best. Any dough that I've ever used with pumpkin in it is usually a very wet and sticky dough and thus does not hold shape well. It was the same with these bagels. Even with the addition of extra flour the dough was really wet and kind of difficult to work with. However I was able to make ugly shaped bagels that tasted good lol. If I make these again I might try using a little whole wheat flour to off set some of the moisture of the pumpkin. I also only used a half teaspoon of salt---and I'm glad I did as that was plenty. I was also surprised that there was no fat in this recipe---no butter or oil. I might add a little next time and see if having some fat in the dough will make the dough a little easier to work with. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",
