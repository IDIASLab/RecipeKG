The cooking temperature and time however left them a little dark on the bottom yet under-cooked inside. So I turn the temperature down to 325 and baked for 15 minutes. Perfect cookies!",

I used crushed up dehydrated apple chips for super intense apple flavor; and I cut up Wer soft caramels for my caramel bits. I also let the dough rest overnight and rolled into balls and pressed them down slightly to get a consistent size for my cookie exchange. Soft chewy yummy.

I used single serving applesauce cup and about 3/4 cup dried apple bits, and would maybe add a few more. The batter is thinner than most cookies but had no troubles with it as written. These cookies do spread out so I only put 9 per cookie sheet. My oven needed 10 min cook time and definitely leave cool the 3 minutes or more to let caramel harden up a bit before taking off pan.
