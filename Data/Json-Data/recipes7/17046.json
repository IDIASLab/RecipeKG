This sauce takes no time to mix up and worked really well with shrimp snow peas onions red bell pepper carrots and fresh pineapple. Did all the prep work early in the day microwaved the cooked rice and had a nice evening dinner with little work. We like food with a bit of heat but between the chili paste and the red pepper flakes I was concerned that it just might be crazy hot for us. I kept the chili paste the same but reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp and my husband said we may want to cut that back just a little more next time (personal taste preference nothing negative here). Thanks for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it.",
