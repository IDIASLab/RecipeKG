I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Because several others had mentioned it was sticky, I spread butter in the bottom of my stoneware jelly pan and no problems.   This was my first try at gluten free and it was a success!  I made these for a friend who is gluten free, but my son ended up eating half of them!  Thank you, Jewel!  I will make these again!",

Since another reviewer mentioned excessive sweetness and strong peanut butter flavor, I decided to try using half sunbutter (sunflower seed spread) and half peanut butter--was not too exact on measuring. I also used about 1 1/2 cups total sugar--half brown sugar, half white. I would definitely make this again!! This is delicious whether you need to eat gluten-free or not. Also, I imagine you could use all sunbutter (instead of peanut butter) for those with peanut allergies. Thanks for the idea!",

Thank you for offering an idea I would never have thought of on my own!\n\nAfter having made them, I believe that the peanut butter cookie base makes the squares far far too sweet and rich, and the peanut taste totally overpowers the rest of the nuts in the bars. At least for my tastes, anyway. My husband and his dad liked them, but they could only eat one square at a sitting.\n\nMy oven sucks, so I only realized later that the cookie base didn't cook/set as much as I would have liked. I would recommend longer than 8 minutes, and at a higher temp to at least set the PB.\n\n**It was easy to make and prep.** If you don't normally have these ingredients in your cupboard, you can save money by only buying the amount you need in the bulk section of your grocery store.\n\nI am going to try to find a gluten-free crust that is more like the original base I knew and loved when I ate gluten. Something less overpowering than the peanut butter.\n\nAll in all, nice to be able to make something to take to holiday parties that was gluten-free, but not many people ate them, and no one took a second.",

As I am sensitive to chemicals I used 2 T raw honey instead of bleached white sugar ( brown sugar is molasses and white sugar) and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a layer of almond meal. I like the honey better and the vanilla adds another delicious taste depth to this very delectable dish. One can indeed tweak this recipe and it still is very good.",

The rest of the family thought the bars were \"delicious\" and ate them as well. I needed to bake them an additional 6 minutes though. And the bars came out perfect. I didn't have any parchment paper so I used a cooking spray specifically for baking. I sliced the bars after approximately 40 minutes of cooling. Then I let them cool thoroughly before serving. The cookie bars came out easily and with little effort. Thank you for a great recipe. I will be making these often for a special niece.",
