It was OK. I think the issue is that we just weren't wild about the dandelion greens - they were fairly tough and bitter. We did saute them with the onions as suggested by others - can't imagine eating them raw. If you love dandelion greens - I am sure you would like this recipe. I did have a little trouble with the sauce - came perilously close to having scrambled eggs. Quickly removed the pan from the heat (which was my mistake...the recipe does not say to have the heat on). It got very thick so I quickly stirred in some cream. The sauce turned out fine and tasted good. Thank you Kasia2 for submitting the recipe. It was fun to try. It doesn't seem fair to give it a 3 when we just didn't like the greens...as I said those who enjoy dandelion greens will no doubt like this. It's a lovely blend of flavors.",

I decided to saute the diced onion and shredded dandelion greens in the butter (they weren't too bitter this way as the other reviewers' mention) before mixing them into the taters. I added roughly a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the dressing; I do think the recipe could use a half recipe more of the dressing to have an amount I think would be just perfect. The mustard really gave it a nice touch. This is the first time I've tried this type of green and I like it. Will definitely make again.",
