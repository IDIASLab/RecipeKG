They sounded wonderful but they tasted terrible...so I made apricots into jam! I didn't have any pectin so I grated in an apple and used a bit of tapioca flour to help it congeal. I also used almond extract as I had more of that on hand than vanilla. Finally I only had enough apricots to make about a cup of jam so I just popped it in the fridge when I finished making it and we enjoyed it for the next week. All in all a lifesaver...thank you Cookin4Six! for sharing this recipe!",
