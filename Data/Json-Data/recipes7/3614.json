I used 1 can of 98% fat free Cream of Mushroom soup, 1 packet Lipton Onion and Mushroom soup, and 1/2 cup water. Cooked on low for 8 hours, removed the meat and veggies and thickened up the liquid with cornstarch. Added garlic salt and fresh thyme to the resulting gravy and served over rice. Delicious!! :-)",
