I rolled each one into a ball about the size of a large marble or undersized ping pong. One batch made 4 dozen. I may have added a lot more oats than I thought! Glad I made so many as everyone wanted to take some home. I love all cookies but these are different. I am the only person in my group who makes these. TIPS: You must refrigerate dough 1st. Roll onto balls for perfect circular cookies. Re- refrigerate if dough starts getting messy (sticking to hands) be wild add more vanilla or cinnamon to taste. Butterscotch is a strong taste don't go overboard on chips.",
