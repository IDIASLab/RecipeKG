I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup added extra squash. Loved it - with that amount of sugar it could be dessert or a side. Nice and low fat sweet and has a veggie - perfect! For a side I'm going to cut back the sugar next time to 3/4 cup and add a little more salt. I made this in a 9 x 13 pan so it was very thin - may try it in a smaller casserole to see how it goes. Thanks so much for this great recipe - definitely a keeper.",

We all liked it, my eight year old loved it! I would have loved it with lemon, as it was, it was too bland. \nI don't usually rate recipes, but since there were only two other reviews, I thought I'd pipe in. It was certainly worth making, but make sure you have the lemon!",

It was almost like a very soft gooey cake. I processed the squash in the food processor instead of mashing it and it worked well. I accidentally forgot to add the lemon extract but I still really liked this. I pressed some fresh berries into the top while it was still warm. The flavor reminded me of cornbread. Can't wait to try it with the lemon next time.",
