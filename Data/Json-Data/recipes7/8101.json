This cake is dee-licious - but it\u2019s NOT a pound cake.  (The amount of leavening is a dead giveaway)  It is a light and fluffy yellow cake, not the heavy cake with the dense, compact crumb so characteristic of a pound cake.  So if you\u2019re looking for a sturdy cake, suitable for carving, or for a genuine pound cake, this would not be the recipe to choose.  I am not criticizing the cake at all as it is a lovely, moist yellow cake.  I only criticize its name.",
