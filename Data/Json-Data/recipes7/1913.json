I took that out and instead I sauteed onions with garlic and put the cumin & curry powder in with that along with some turmeric then added that into mash with the sweet potatoes. I used 3 dipping sauces as everyone likes a something different: mango chutney soy sauce and a healthy Dijon yogourt-based dressing made by Bolthouse farms (I think someone has suggested cutting dijon mustard with white wine and that sounds lovely as well).",

And added a dash of cayenne pepper and cumin. The sweetness and spice was a wonderful combination. Next time I will brush the outside of each with a little oil so they will crisp a little better.
