I also added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon b/c it just seemed like it needed more!  On top of that I used cinnamon apple sauce.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk b/c I usually use buttermilk when baking breads and it makes the bread even more dense & moist!  I did not add the cinnamon sugar to the bottom, instead during the last 15 min of baking I added it on top to give a nice sweet crunch.  The end result?...YUMMY!",

I make 1 loaf, which usually takes 70 minutes in my oven and 1 dozen muffins which take 20-25 minutes. I've been asked for this recipe many times. Thanks :)",

I used a 4 oz./individual size cinnamon applesauce from my son's lunch packs - so easy! I didn't measure the cinnamon sugar out to dust the pans, I just sprinkled the amount I liked. I topped one of the loaves with cinnamon sugar, the other without; we preferred the taste of the one with, but thought that the without looked prettier - go figure! My oven is rather hot, these were done to perfection in 55 minutes. Thank you TS for taking the time to post, this will go in my recipe box! Mmmmmmmm :-)",

I used half brown/half white sugar for a darker looking loaf. In lieu of the sugar mixture on the bottom I borrowed the cinnamon sugar mixture on top from the cinnamon bread I recipe here on allrecipes. It smells wonderful baking and came out so nicely from the pans that I sprayed with baking spray. They rose very nicely and look like a picture. These are off into care packages so I am not sure of the taste but the batter sure tasted great! and 5 stars for presentation! this recipe is a keeper and I'll try the sugar bottom mix. next time.",

Freezes perfectly too!  I generally use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, up the applesauce to 3/4 c and add more like a tablespoon of cinnamon. Sometimes I toss in some cloves, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, etc. if I feel inclined. I generally use the french vanilla pudding as well. I never do the dusting of cinnamon sugar, as my experience by doing that always results in a burnt-tasting crust. This quick bread is a great stand-alone bread, but it's over-the-top great with a drizzle of melted butter, cinnamon and brown sugar just after removing from the oven. As the bread cools, the drizzle will \"glaze\" the bread. Honestly, this is in my top 5 favorite all-time recipes from AR. Outstanding!",
