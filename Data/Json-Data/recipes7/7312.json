I'm thinking it's good enough for a repeat as it's very simple to make, but next time I'm going to melt the butter and add it into the flour mixture.  Oh and if you don't have self rising flour just add 1 1/4 tsp baking powder & 1/4 tsp salt to the bottom of a 1 cup measuring cup, and level it off w/ all purpose flour.",

The recipe said to \"pour\" it over the peaches, so I thought it should be wet, like batter.  But, I dumped it on top of the fruit and spread it out.  Poured the butter over and made sure it was all covered. I used my 9 or 10 inch deep dish pie plate, and it just fit.\n\nIt was fantastic!  My husband loved it, too.  I might try adding a little cinnamon next time, but it's 5 stars as written.  I love the old time recipes.  My mom's cooking was from the 40s and this tastes like something she would have made.   Simple and tasty, and easy to make from simple, everyday ingredients.  Thank you for sharing this!  Your great-grandma would be proud.",

The inside was nice and soft and the top layer was just a little bit crunchy, which was yummy.\nI did not have self-rising flour, but another reviewer suggested simply adding baking powder and salt to regular flour. This worked great. I used 1 1/4 baking powder per 1 cup of flour (didn't use any salt).\nWhen I put it in the oven, I noticed the butter pooling a bit in one spot along the side. Once it was cooled off a bit, I noticed that it was also a bit too crunchy in one place along the side (probably where the butter pooled), so be sure to drizzle the butter evenly and not too much at the sides of the dish.",
