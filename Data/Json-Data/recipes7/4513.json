Well, I have developed this version that has a great texture and a surprisingly good flavor (my brother couldn't even tell that it wasn't beef)! The secret is the quinoa, which adds wonderful texture and is much nuttier than breadcrumbs. I hope you enjoy this recipe!",

Just to address a couple of issues some people are having:\n\nWhen making the recipe I used ground turkey which was a mixture of white and dark meat. This not only helped add flavor but it also added moisture that helped it to not become crumbly. Adding an extra egg is also a great way to bind it even more and hey! Extra protein!\n\nSecondly, this meatloaf is meant to be free-formed on a flat pan. Ground turkey and ground beef cook two different ways.  Beef tends to give off a considerable amount of fat and a little juice making it ok (although not at all healthy) to cook it in a loaf pan soaking in its oils.... turkey and chicken on the other hand give off a lot of moisture and very little fat, so basically when you cook it in a loaf pan it is steaming and soaking in turkey water, making for a mushy fall-aparty (yes i made that word up) loaf.\n\nI hope this helps some of the future folk who make this recipe.\n\n~drew",

                "reviewBody": "This produced a moist and tender 'meatloaf'. I didn't find that the quinoa added any noticeable flavor. What I really didn't like was how the hot sauce overwhelmed this recipe. It was all we could taste (the spiciness wasn't a problem, just the one dimensional flavor). This could be made so much better and given more dimension with the right mix of herbs and spices. It's a good solid start but needs a bit of work.",
