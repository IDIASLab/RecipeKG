This one wasn't.  My husband and I thought the flavor of this recipe was just OK.  I won't make it again because I didn't think it was worth the time it took to make it, but mainly because it is VERY expensive to make.  I live in Atlanta and Gruyere cheese is $19.00 per pound!  That's right -- an 8 oz. block of it cost me $9.50. When you add in the cost of fresh rosemary and thyme, extra sharp cheddar, and the cost of the squash, it costs about $18.00 to make this dish.  It would have to be extra super delicious for me to pay this much to make it again and it just wasn't.\n\n",

Yes, you can make it all ahead of time, just keep the the squash part and the breadcrumb mixture separate until you are ready to reheat the squash mixture and finish it.  Otherwise the breadcrumbs get soggy.\n\nOther notes: Using coarse breadcrumbs smashed up a little bit works a little better than the fine canned breadcrumbs you get at the grocery store.  Also you can use all cheddar if gruyere or emmenthaler are too difficult or expensive... but I really like the flavor they give.",

It was actually slightly cheaper than the regular Gruyere not that it mattered - it was not as outrageously priced here as it is in other areas apparently and if it was I simply would not have made this for a typical Sunday dinner nor would I have reviewed it. Only changes I made were to use panko bread crumbs vegetable stock and thyme that I had dried a few weeks ago all substitutions based on what I had on hand. I can't say enough about this - it was absolutely delicious! A golden crunchy crust over delicious sweet butternut squash - just heavenly! Kept trying to think of something to add or change but the best I could do was to sprinkle some freshly cracked pepper before eating it. Thanks for coming up with a new favorite!",

For those like me that like to tinker with recipes here are a couple variations I like to do:  (1) you can roast the butternut squash halved in its skin at 425 for approx 45mins or until tender and then scoop out the squash and prepare the rest of the way as is--this gives the flavor a little more depth from the roasting  (2) I am a carmelized onion junkie, so rather than mixing some of the sauteed onions and garlic into the butternut squash, I like to carmelize 3 onions with a little bit of thyme and butter and then top the butternut squash with them (the breadcrumb-cheese mixture goes on top of the that) before baking as directed.  This creates a layered effect of the different flavors and the carmelized onion makes it even more savory.    This is a great and versatile recipe that is just a little bit away from the traditional holiday fare you see--a little labor intensive--but worth it.",

My squash came from my  garden, so I'm not sure it was 2.5 lbs (measured 9\"). Since I wasn't sure of the weight, I did cut back on all the cheeses slightly.  Prep work is about 30 minutes, but the end result is worth it.  I used panko bread crumbs slightly crushed (as suggested by the submitter) and this added nice texture.  I enjoyed the combination of the three cheeses in this dish!  Since I have an abundance of this squash taking over the yard, I will be making this a few times this summer!!
