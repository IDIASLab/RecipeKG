Not that it needed changing but to meet my own requirements. I used 2 tablespoons of Bacardi Gold rum and also added cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips used the rest of the ingredients as stated. Mixed the batter as per the recipe (smelled delicious) but as I use a large baking sheet I only make 2 logs. Split my batter in half in the KA and then working with each log separately I kneed in a small amount of flour into each log on the counter I then kneed for a minute until smooth once smooth I roll out the log like a sausage place this on the wax paper and press down to inch thick on the baking tray. I find this easier to deal with rather than rolling flat and then moving to the baking tray. I bake for 30 minutes until golden brown remove from the oven. When cooling I move the wax paper containing the biscotti off the baking tray and place it straight on the cooling rack I cut with a serrated knife after 8 minutes of cooling. I bake at FULL temperature for a further 15 minutes on each side. I made an unbelievable 50 Biscotti from this batch. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe sueb @//-_-\\\\@",

Because I wanted bigger pieces of biscotti I made two loafs instead of four and I sprinkled them with a little cinnamon & sugar before baking and I toasted mine longer than 15min a side I probably did 30min a side I like mine pretty crisp. These came out of the oven absolutely delicious the banana flavor was great and not too over powering it was just right. I can't wait to make these again but with a thicker layer of cinnamon/sugar on them it complimented the banana flavor really well!",
