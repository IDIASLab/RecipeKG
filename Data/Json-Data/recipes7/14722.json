Well I guess that it didn t matter because they were simply delicious anyway. The cookie dough is very easy to work with and since the recipe author doesn t tell you how big they should be I used a 2-1/4 cutter. The cookie dough is tender flavorful and the apple filling will make you think you re eating a piece of apple pie. I don t bake often but I d definitely make these again.

I kept having more filling left over so kept making batches until I just had to accept I wasn't going to come out even.  I even tried making deeper pies using a cupcake tray which held more filling (worked out great, just cut the bottom circle half bigger than the top crust).  No one was unhappy with how many batches I made!  Like someone else said, I used a glass to cut out the dough, about 2 inch diameter was good. And also cut the apples up a bit.  I sprinkled the whole thing with cinnamon sugar instead of rolling, you could do it before baking so it sticks better.  The crimping wasn't sticking the halves together as well as I hoped, but everything stayed together fine after baking.  I didn't think I was much of an apple pie fan, but these made me realize otherwise.",
