                "reviewBody": "These were very good. It's hard to go wrong with pumpkin. I made them just as directed except that I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening. I also added a cream cheese frosting by mixing 8 oz of cream cheese with 1/4 cup butter 1 pound of powdered sugar & 2 tsp. of vanilla extract. A good old fashioned butter cream would taste great with these cupcakes too. -Chopped pecans would be fantastic in these or even sprinkled on top with the frosting! - Also if you don't have cake flour don't fret. You can make it yourself. Use two cups all-purpose flour and remove 4 Tbsp of flour and replace it with 4 Tbsp of cornstarch. Sift this together very well then use in the recipe in place of cake flour. -Lastly you can definitely \"healthify\" this recipe by using applesauce in place of the vegetable oil skim or 1% milk in place of whole milk and swap out 3/4 cup of the sugar for Splenda.",
