I followed this word for word other van using low fat vanilla yogurt in place of plain. The topping is delicious the muffins baked up beautifully(really the prettiest muffins I've ever made) & I LOVE the fact that they don't use lemon. That being said they did not come out very moist the batter was sooooo dry I had trouble incorporating the blueberries without smashing them & the muffins are tasteless. Another submitter used brown sugar in place of white....maybe that's the key. I'm sorry:(",
