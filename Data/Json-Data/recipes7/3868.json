I just couldn't add ketchup and sour cream and didn't need the milk bouillon or ground almonds. As others suggested I also used light coconut milk and cooked it much longer than indicated to get my potatoes to cook through. I used new potatoes and needed to add about 15 minutes to the cook time. Squeeze some lime juice over just before serving. Yummy!",

I chose it because of its use of garam masala and turmeric - true flavors of India. My family eats a gluten and casein (dairy) free diet so I did make some changes. My replacements were as follows: butter - Earth Balance soy-free milk - DariFree milk replacer sour cream - Tofutti Better Than Sour Cream chicken bouillon - Gluten free all-natural chicken flavor concentrate I also only had one regular potato so I used it and a sweet potato as sweet potatoes are what I typically use in my curry. I did not add the ground almonds because I didn't feel it needed thickening. Others mentioned they did not add the ketchup. I did but didn't really taste what difference it made. The taste of this was about four stars. I almost gave this three stars because I felt the recipe called for a lot of ingredients - not to mention ingredients not typically used in curry but I felt that it is not the fault of recipe provider that I'm spoiled by another recipe that has less ingredients. The recipe I normally use packs a much more flavorful punch and this one left me feeling that it was good but needed something. Maybe lemon juice?",

I used several mini potatoes as they were all I had on hand, and I cooked them ahead in the microwave for a couple of minutes based on others comments - perfect!  I also left out the ground almonds and cubes of bouillon - the almonds I did not have, and the bouillon cubes I do not use, but figured they would just add a ton of sodium anyway!  Fantastic...next time will make it to serve over basmati as I only ate it as a side dish to my chicken!!  Super yummy, will make again for sure :)",
