Folded that into the cream cheese mixture.     \n? Rolled up two regular-sized whole wheat tortillas. \n? Drizzled 2+ Tablespoons of the the hot/warm sauce over each.  \n?Threw in toaster oven for 15 mins. @ usual setting for toast. Probably should have allowed the apple mix to cool \n     before adding it to the cream cheese but...\n        \u2022 It was pure heaven. Absolutely Supreme. The sauce had caramelized into a deep, dark exquisitely gooey chew.\n        \u2022 Knowing it was low in sugar, fat and calories made it taste extra yummy and delicious!    \n        \u2022 Even better - knowing it was mostly pretty good for me! \n ??

Any longer and the sugar pour-over would be burnt. Keep an eye on it towards the end. The cream cheese mixed with apples made it creamy and nice. Just sweet enough. Added ice cream on top while still warm. Had leftovers gobbled up next day. Another reviewer said next day not so good but we liked it both days. Maybe make sure the sugar mixture covered everything then there would not be any crunchy edges. Will make this again!!",
