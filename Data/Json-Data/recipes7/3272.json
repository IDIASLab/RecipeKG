Everything fit on a single baking sheet, so we just used the one. Our vegetables started burning pretty early, so I reduced the temp to 400 degrees and stirred the veggies, and that worked for us. After cooking we couldn't wait to try it, so we skipped the 30 minutes of cooling time. We wanted to eat the veggies hot, so that worked for us. We'll definitely make this one again. Would live to try it on the grill like everyone else did.",

I followed the recipe almost exactly (sweet potato carrot parsnip asparagus red and yellow roasted bell pepper fresh basil pressed the garlic in a garlic press) except I had a few things in the oven cooking slowly on a lower temp so I ended up sauteeing the veggies in a frying pan uncovered with a little olive oil on medium high heat--15 minutes for the root veggies and then I added the asparagus for another ten minutes or so. The root veggies ended up browned on all sides (it was more labor intensive than the oven--I had to stand and move them around a lot) and perfectly cooked as was the asparagus but the dish was done in 25 minutes and in my opinion came out better than roasting typically does. I also chopped the roasted red peppers into very small pieces--they coated the rest of the veggies nicely that way. Everyone went back for seconds. The fresh garlic and fresh basil tasted amazing! Thanks for such a keeper of a recipe.",

Never thought I would like parsnips but everything came out so delicious and sweet even the radishes. This is a good way to get a variety of veg. and your veg. quota for the day. You can add a little more seasoning than called for if you wish. Probably just about any veg . will work as long as you start the firm ones first and add the softer veggies later. Thanks Lorelei--now I love to eat my vegetables. BTW-they are best at room tempeature .",
