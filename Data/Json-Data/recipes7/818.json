Except that I knew from the ingredients list I would have to \"tweak\" it quite a bit if anyone in my family was even going to consider eating these (definitely not intended to disparage either the recipe or the contributor just my own family's idiosyncratic eating preferences). So I left out the stuff that we don't like (olives skim milk yogurt) and substituted stuff that we do like (celery some green and red peppers whole milk reduced fat sour cream) for them. I also used 2 tbls. of applesauce and 2 melted 2 tbls. butter instead of the vegetable oil for shortening and I tossed some parmesan cheese and paprika into the batter too. The result: The muffins turned out wonderfully in that they baked up nicely were attractive in appearance and had a nice texture. Flavor-wise? I thought they were kind of \"they are what they are; good but nothing great\". My husband's initial reaction was a quizzical expression and \"strange\" as a comment. And then he proceeded to eat 3 more muffins. My daughter said: \"Wow these are GOOD! Are we having them for dinner tonight?\" And my son actually brought a friend over and told him: \"You HAVE to try these things! They're great!\" (and his friend agreed) I actually wound up making 2 more batches before dinner. I served these muffins with a tomato based soup and a tossed salad but make no mistake -- the MUFFINS ruled the meal. (I gave this recipe 5 stars. Even though I tweaked it",

I also added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. I also used whole wheat flour. They came out really good. I can't help but think that there's SOMETHING missing I just can't put my finger on it. I'll definitely make these again and play around with the recipe more. EDIT: I have now made these several times tweaking it in various ways. Here is my favorite variation: Make according to recipe except: Use whole wheat flour and toss in 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. For special effect in the last 10 minutes of baking sprinkle on some shredded cheddar cheese and paprika! I love these muffins!",
