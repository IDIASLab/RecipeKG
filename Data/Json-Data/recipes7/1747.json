It tastes like a spice cake. I dislike pumpkin as a rule, but this cake is another story. Topped with cinnamon cream cheese frosting, it's sooo tasty! I can't wait to see if the rest of my family likes it as much as I do. I've also made this recipe using applesauce instead of pumpkin and it's just as good.  This recipe calls for no eggs or salt.",
