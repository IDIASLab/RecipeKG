I used Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust from Allrecipes instead of a store bought crust made the recipe as written otherwise. Mine needed to bake about 10 minutes longer as it was quite jiggly. Let it cool longer as well for easier slicing. Thanks for a great pie recipe! #AllrecipesAllstarsCanda #PiDay2018 #FacelessNoMore",
