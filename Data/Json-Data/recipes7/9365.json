That is really saying a lot too because both my boyfriend and his daughter are incredibly picky eaters.

I did try some cake without frosting and have to say the GF flour made the cake taste a little off to me so you definitely want to plan on using frosting.

We didn't use enough chia seed first soaked in water and like other gluten-free recipes without a binder the consistency will be a problem. So without the xanthan gum the taste was spot on the cake was moist but it didn't hold together well. The guests didn't mind it too much cause it was healthier than other cakes and we used a cream cheese icing which went really well. Second pay careful attention to the baking time! We used 30 minutes as a guideline for our first attempt but with convection ovens the times are shortened and we could've pulled out the cake at 15-20 minutes with a 9\" round pan. Lastly we used whole mayo not low-fat with whole ingredients which we feel helped the moistness of the cake. In any case we're going to try this again but next time with actual xanthan gum and may use more to get more binding. Oh we used trader joe's non-gluten flour which is Rice based. I'd like to try another non-Wheat flour next time maybe even oat.",
