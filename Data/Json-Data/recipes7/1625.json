However, the first time I tried baking the cake, it was overcooked, dry, and brownish after only 45 minutes.  Luckily I had enough ingredients left for a second cake, so I tried again and watched it very closely!  At 35 minutes, the cake was almost perfectly done, especially when you consider that it will continue to cook a bit longer until removed from the pan.  It turned out to be a delicious dessert and we will look forward to having it again.",

I used my stand mixer and modified the recipe to use only 8 oz of room temp low-fat cream cheese 1/2 tsp Watkins double strength vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract -- and I forgot the salt (oops)! The whole thing came together in less than one minute -- it was amazing! Instead of having a \"torte\" with multiple layers frosted only in-between I laid down a thin layer of the frosting on the 1st layer of cake with my silicone spatula arranged split strawberries on it and then covered it with another thin layer of frosting. Then I topped with my 2nd layer of marble cake and frosted the whole thing top and sides -- I used the spatula for the whole operation it's a very forgiving frosting. Add a few strawberries on top and VOILA! Guests said it was the best cake they'd ever eaten and most zeroed right in on this frosting! I was amazed at how well this cake/frosting held up to room temperature not like a whipped cream frosting normally would. This will now be a family standard -- easy quick and absolutely yummy! Thanks for the recipe!",
