I love the mandarin oranges and orange zest! My husband didn't know there were mandarin oranges in the cake, but what a way to make a moist cake. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful cake! I didn't have canned mandarin oranges so I used 3 small fruit cups in 100% juice which are 4 oz. each from Dole. I drained the oranges. I also live at high altitude, 5062 feet. So, I had to adjust the baking soda to 1 and 1/4 tsp.",

Stores in my area sell only 15 oz cans. Was hard to know how to measure 11 oz so I added all 15 oz to recipe. Used rest of ingredients as called for except I substituted vegetable oil with organic coconut oil. Could be the extra 4 oz of mandarins with combo of 2 cups of sugar made it too sweet for my taste. When making next batch I'll reduce sugar or lesser oranges. Prep time was more than 15 minutes. Took 45 minutes between measuring shredding carrots and beating mixture. Baked 45 minutes. Cake's been refrigerated for three days; still a bit sweeter for me. After microwaving a piece I spread soft butter on it and enjoyed it. Thanks for submitting your recipe.o",

I made this last night for my mom's birthday since she loves carrot/spice cakes and she freaking loved it! It was so light yet moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and used some store bought cream cheese icing and chopped pecans as a topping which gave it a nice crunch. I'm thinking the next time I make it I'll substitute raisins for the carrots after using the mixer to see how that tastes and actually make the cream cheese icing. Thank you for sharing!",
