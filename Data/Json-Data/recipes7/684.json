I used a homeade vegetable stock I had on hand instead of boullion and adjusted the water accordingly. I too did not change anything else because it looked good to me on paper and I'm happy to report that it turned just wonderful. The meat was so tender and the flavor was great. For my own preference I took a bit of liquid out just before serving and whisked in a bit of flour till it was smooth and then poured it back into the cooker for about 20 minutes to thicken is up a bit. I prefer a thicker \"stew\". This was so tasty and just what I needed after a long day. I highly recommend:-)",

That probably would taste really bad in a slow cooker. Great recipe overall. Thank you",
