They were too dry and cakey thick not much flavor and I would have liked the cheese to be more melted. I ended up making 54 of them. Now I did substitute the ground beef with ground turkey and I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. Those changes may have caused some of my dislikes.

                "reviewBody": "12.19.15 I followed this recipe to the letter and honestly was a little disappointed. Just a couple tips: you don t get much rise on the muffins so do fill each mini-muffin cup to the top. Also they don t spread out so be sure that the top of each muffin is smoothed out for a nicer presentation because it s going to come out of the oven looking like it did when it went in (hope that makes sense). I checked these muffins at 13 minutes and they already were overdone and too brown IMO so watch your time. I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings so I should have ended up with 12 mini muffins. I ended up with 30 which almost makes me wonder if the author meant regular sized muffins??? These aren t bad but they just didn t have as much flavor as I was anticipating. Missing something just not sure what else would kick up the flavor. This is the first review on this recipe and I don t want to discourage others from giving it a try. This simply didn t live up to my expectations. Lori P sorry for the somewhat critical comments but I do want to give an honest review.",
