The only changes we made were to substitute Splenda for sugar and for the meatballs we sliced string cheese into small rounds and hid them inside the meatballs. The recipe says it serves 6 but we served 8 good eaters, with a small salad on the side. Simply a great meal.",

The meat balls made 12 balls about golf ball size - I had to add a splash of milk to get the meat and cheese mixture to hang together. The meatballs might have had a better texture if I had added to milk to the bread crumbs and egg rather than at the end. Thanks for a good recipe.",
