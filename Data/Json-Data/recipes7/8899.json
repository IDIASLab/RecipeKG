I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white all purpose flour. Instead of white sugar I used Stevia in the Raw baking sweetener measured true to sugar. Instead of shortening I used real butter. Instead of a Hersheys Kiss I used a chunk of a Snickers bar. These were flaky and delicious. Will use this recipe again and again and again.",

Overall a little on the dry side but still good. The family liked them a lot. This batch made about 40 average-size cookies.",

My homemade almond butter is slightly sweetened, so I didn't think 2 cups of sugar was necessary. These are light in texture and flavor. I also added a few Trader Joe's sliced honey roasted almonds to top each cookie. Initially, I was a little worried because the dough seemed too light and fluffy (not enough flour), but they came out perfect. I used a cookie scoop so I didn't have to get my hands dirty.
