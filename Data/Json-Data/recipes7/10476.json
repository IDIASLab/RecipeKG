I like to add a bit of brown sugar near the end of it's simmer time to counter the acid and add a mellow note. Then I began to play with it.  Balsamic vinegar (white or red) is a nice substitution. I was out of celery once and no one noticed, so I don't bother with it anymore.  They're also just as happy with my quick-cooked take on this which uses (don't judge!) dried minced onions and only simmers for 30 minutes. It's more of a dump-and-cook affair.  It tastes almost exactly like the longer-cooking original with much less time and effort. Most of the time I do it quick, but sometimes I bring the love with fresh onions and let it simmer it all day.  Fast or slow, this is amazing tomato sauce, on par with the best of the restaurant sauces.",

The first time you make it make the recipe exactly as written and include ALL ingredients including the anchovy paste which adds no anchovie flavor but a nice subtle richness to this sauce.  Follow the instructions exactly.  I'm a very experimental cook but sometimes I like to make recipes as written the first time to see what the chef intended.  This was a very pleasant surprise and a staple in my kitchen.  One thing, I did not buy the five dollar a can San Marzano tomatoes.  I buy good quality name brand crushed tomatoes and they're more than fine for this sauce.",

So I just simmered slowly with the lid off and let the sauce thicken on its own.  SO good I'm going to make it again tonight and serve with linguini and chorizo.  Oh...by the way, we have Roma tomatoes galore in our freezer - so easy to run them under hot water and pop them right out of their skins (while they are frozen) and so I used them instead of the canned ones.",

It was just a matter of what pasta dish was going to grace the presence of this sauce.  I chose Chef John's Penne with Vodka Sauce found on this site.  Amazing!  Both of them.  I didn't change a thing.  I mushed the tomatoes up in my hands like I knew what I was doing and even though my taste test of the sauce at 30 minutes was to die for, I gladly cooked it another hour because well thats what we honorary Italian's do.

I omitted the anchovy paste and used a can of petite diced tomatoes...I was able to skip the step where you were supposed to hand-squash the tomatoes too. I also only simmered it for about 30 mins. It still came out great! This is a great recipe if you don't have a jar of sauce on hand or want something that tastes more like it came from a nice restaurant.",

                "reviewBody": "Very disappointing. I did everything according the recipe exactly. Expected the house to begin smelling heavenly. I was even excited to savor the anchovy paste within the recipe as one reviewer assured us to just add it you won't even know it's there. The house immediately began to fill with an acrid smell far beyond the expected aroma of spaghetti sauce aroma. An hour in I realized that I was not going to be able to eat this very different spaghetti sauce sauce. Got out the jar of Newman's Sockarooni so I could eat what I'd been craving. Sorry Chef John. I took in the whole of this recipe based on the solid reviews but the sauce is nothing like I expected. The aroma alone set me off. (was it the anchovy paste?)",
