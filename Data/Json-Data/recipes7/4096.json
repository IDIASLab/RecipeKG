But we still enjoyed it alot! I used one jumbo jalapeno and the heat was just right and also used frozen raspberries. (The fresh ones at the store looked awful!) Made this to go on grilled chicken sandwiches with jalapeno havarti cheese and this sauce complimented it nicely! Think it'd be great over a block of cream cheese with crackers and can't wait to try it on other meats. Thanks Holly:)",

As suggested by a previous review I cut back on the vinegar and the results were very good. We have enjoyed this with Salmon and pork but our favorite is with a nice grilled steak cut into strips and the Raspberry Chipolte sauce lightly drizzled over. For a special presentation drizzle the sauce in a swirled pattern on the serving dish and place grilled steak strips on top. Steamed rice and a veggie makes a beautiful service. Very tasty too!",
