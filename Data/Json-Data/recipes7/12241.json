The acid in cream of tartar gives snickerdoodles their distinctive tangy flavor, and the chew happens because cream of tartar prevents sugar in the cookie dough from crystalizing into crunchiness.

That was 18 years ago (when he moved out).  I didn't realize how much I missed it until this year when I am baking with my three grandchildren (ages 9, 7 and 2 :-)  ).  This was the first recipe we tried and it is AWESOME.  The kids and I had great fun making such a wonderfully easy recipe.  We made it just as it said and the cookies not only got a rave review from the grandkids - but from my son and daughter-in-law too.  Thank you for posting this old recipe , not just because they are wonderfully tasting cookies - but because your recipe helped me find my happy place - shared with my three little blessings.",

Definitely will be making these again. \n\nI did substitute 3 teaspoons of baking powder in place of the tartar with baking soda. And after tasting the dough, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The warning in the recipe of the cookies looking \"doughy\" is accurate and appreciated! I was a little uneasy about how raw they looked at 7 minutes (400 degrees). But they finished beautifully on the tray and cooling rack. Very delicious, crisp on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside!!!!",

Well when we retired out of the US a few years back crisco is not an option and the shortening I can get might as well be lard...so after finally running out of my crisco stock I was desperate to find another great recipe like the one my family has used forever.  Well I finally found it!!! I didn't change a thing as I normally don't when trying someone's recipe for the first time.  I questioned at first no vanilla??? Then still didn't change or add a thing.  Every picky snickerdoodle person loved it!!! Normally butter only cookies take quite a bit of finesse to get them to taste right and texture to be delightful.  Well I did bake them at 350 in my oven on convection (convection temp actually 325) for 8 min like my old recipe, where we live I know my oven. Then let them cook and cool for an additional 3-5 min before transferring them to the foil covered cooling rack.  They were a hit!  My neighbors are snickerdoodle freaks and said this is better than my old ones and the best they ever had!  The same type of compliments to everyone I gave them too!  I am my own worst critic (hubby says so all the time) and I honestly would never change a thing in this recipe!  (Except maybe to double or triple it) Thank you so much for this recipe and sharing it!!! It's a keeper!!!!",
