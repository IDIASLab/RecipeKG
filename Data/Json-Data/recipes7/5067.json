It mostly tasted like strawberry frozen yogurt with bananas. I couldn't really taste the chocolate. Only changes I made was using 1/2 the fat vanilla ice cream 1% milk and a packet of Truvia for the sugar. I also only had about 6oz of yogurt but it was more than plenty. This is definitely closer to a frozen yogurt shake or drink than a smoothie but I wanted something like that anyway. TY",
