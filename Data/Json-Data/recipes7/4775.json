When I asked you for a description you said...\"Imagine a blond brownie and an apple pie... they meet on a moonlit night in paris... they share a bottle of wine...They're chewy bar... like a butterscotch brownie kinda...\" no truer words were ever written. The one addition I made was adding a 1/2 bag of Heath toffee chips to the batter. Just outstanding and rest assured, I'll be making these again.",

Recipe has plenty of spice without.  Used walnuts as had on hand.  Served with homemade vanilla ice cream.  Will use often.  Great way to use up 3-4 apples that need eating up! ( EDIT: I have made this several times now and cut the spices in half.  Much better and not so overpowering.  I also have added dried cranberries on occasion - delicious!)",

(It's not a reflection of the recipe. If you want to double it, go nuts.) I only made two minor changes. I eliminated the pecans because I didn't have any and I just threw butter into the cast iron skillet, not really measuring. Other that a doubled recipe, those were the only changes. This did take an hour-twenty minutes to bake and I did have to cover it halfway through with foil. For a novice cast iron skillet user, this was cake for me and it used all pantry ingredients I had on hand. It turned out beautifully and the smell during baking was almost like.....apple-bready-custard. Thanks, Ev! NOTE: Don't double the recipe. HUGE mistake on my part. Just do a single recipe.
