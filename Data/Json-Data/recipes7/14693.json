This recipe was interesting to me because of it's Mediterranean diet concept but I was a little afraid because I haven't made something like this before. I generally eye-ball my portions so I probably didn't make it EXACTLY per the recipe. I doubled/tripled the spices to get a little more flavor out, but was able to get a very nicely balanced, yet gentle, zing from the vinegar, sweetness from the honey, kick from the chili pepper, crunch from the red onion, chew from the cranberries (sub'ed for raisins), squish from roasted squashes, overall texture pulled together by the little balls of quinoa. I highly recommend adding the parsley on top at serving as this preserved the unique flavor addition far more than mixing it in. This will probably become a standard as it would be great for potlucks or holiday gatherings (it's beautiful!).",
