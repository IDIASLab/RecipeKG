My common sense (which I foolishly ignored) told me a half cup of milk just wasn\u2019t right.  And it wasn\u2019t.  I should have trusted that, followed through, and added milk as necessary, if at all.  I ended up with glop.  Risking destroying the integrity of the baked cookie I had to add another full cup of flour just to have the dough have some resemblance to cookie dough, and even then it was still sticky.  After chilling it in the fridge, it was still sticky, but I\u2019ve made other chocolate cookies where the dough was sticky and they turned out fine.  Not this one.  While the photo I\u2019ve submitted of these cookies doesn\u2019t look half bad, it is total deception.  I handed a cookie to Hubs for a taste test, keeping my comments to myself for the time being.  After taking a bite he handed the cookie back to me and with an apologetic look on his face said, \u201cThese are bad.\u201d  I tasted it too and agreed that outside of sweetness and a faint peanut butter flavor it was tasteless \u2013 this in spite of a full cup of very good cocoa powder.   I threw out the whole batch, the baked cookies as well as the unbaked dough  - effectively, that means one star, inedible.  I\u2019m not sure, had the dough called for an appropriate amount of flour, that it would have even made a difference in the final result.",
