I thought they needed some nuts or crunch to offset how very moist they are. (I like my muffins a bit cakey.) However I was told that I MUST make them exactly the same again. And I feel good about giving them to DH without any oil and with some whole wheat flour. I made half muffins and the other half a loaf. The loaf came out a bit dark--not sure why the note says to leave it in the oven an extra 15 min. But it still tasted great. Thanks for a recipe I'll be making again.:)",

And then I realized I only had self rising whole wheat flour so I used 1/2 C of that and 1/2 C ground flax. Because of the self rising flour I didn't use baking powder or salt. It definitely need like 1/2 to 1 tsp more baking powder because the muffins were flat. I only had 1 1/2 C of AP flour. And I only had 3/4 cup of applesauce...short story it was a struggle. But SURPRISINGLY it turned out really nice ha! It tasted fresh and not sugary. Next time I'd like to stick closer to the recipe ha.

I used 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar and still felt like it didn't need to be as sweet! I would love to get away with 1/2 c of each next time. I threw in some flaxseed meal (maybe about 1/3 c) since I didn't have oats. The muffins were soft and moist. I think the oats or some nuts would give it a great texture.
