I was not sure what purpose the white sugar had so I omitted it adjusted cayenne to my own taste and left out the pepper only because I don't care for it. These tasted like candy for a veggie! This will be a repeat recipe for sure and thankyou to the person who posted it. For those of you new to making things like this the secret is to spread the \"pancakes\" as thin as possible by squishing and spreading them thin with the back of a spoon. Flip them when they are lightly browned then remove them to a warming spot once the second side is brown. If they do not hold together you either need a bit more egg or cook them longer. The mixture should be lightly sloppy with some puddling of liquid in the bottom in the bowl. Anything like this takes time to cook but is well worth it.",
