When she made a pie, she would take the excess dough and make these simple cookies. You don't have to make a pie first, all you need is pie dough. My father loves when I make them for him, and I think you will be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't. My father said she called them Piggies. That's what I call them.",

The next time I had leftover pie crust (not from this recipe actually a storebought roll-out kind since I was in a rush eek!) I rolled out the leftovers spread it with crisco mixed some extra crisco cinnamon and sugar together and spread the paste onto the cookies rolled and sliced. I sliced them about 1/4\" thick instead of 3/4\" sprinkled a little extra cinnamon-sugar mixture on top and baked for 6 minutes at 425 degrees. They came out tiny and crispy and flaky with a caramelized bottom... absolutely irresistible and impossible to stop eating! Fantastic recipe the main thing is SLICE VERY THIN BEFORE YOU BAKE!",
