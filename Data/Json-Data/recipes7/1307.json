My amended Step 3 is: Stir the texturized vegetable protein and vegetable flake mixture in with the mushroom and onions. Mix bread crumbs pepper sea salt thyme savory cloves and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add bread crumb mixture into vegetable mixture. Pour the beer into the skillet with the vegetable mixture; remove from heat and cool. I used 1/4 tsp marjoram and 1/4 tsp sage instead of savory. I also used a frozen pie crust and only used 2/3 of the filling inside the pie. Fantastic with cranberry chutney!!",
