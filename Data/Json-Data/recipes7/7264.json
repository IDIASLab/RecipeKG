I also added in a little optional green onion. I mixed the mayo and seasoning in a separate bowl before folding it into the tuna and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 2 Tbsp. of Hellman's light mayo cut with 2 Tbsp. of reduced fat sour cream for added creaminess and reduced the curry to 1 tsp. which was plenty. It chilled for a half an hour and it came out really good. Overall a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!",
