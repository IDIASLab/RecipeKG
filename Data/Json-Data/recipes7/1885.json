I don't have a smooth tube pan, so I sprayed my fluted bundt cake pan with butter flavored Pam and it turned out very pretty.  This was so incredibly tasty!  I did follow two other reviews and laid a sheet of foil over the top after 15 minutes of baking to prevent hardening and I placed a large foil covered cookie sheet underneath to prevent a mess on my oven floor if it bubbled over (which it did just a tad bit).  Next time I will use 3 apples and margarine, but I'm sure it will be just as fantastic as it was this morning.",

Not to mention the neighbor when they find out I've made it. Never any left overs. If you don't have refrigerator biscuits and dont want to go to the store use baking mix follow the insructions for biscuits and just pull off pieces of the dough - and proceed as usual. You can also use other fruits - and berries although if you do brown sugar doesnt necessarily go with some fruit and berries but white sugar always does - also try adding a bit of vanilla to your liquid when mixing the dough (if using baking mix) or to the melted margarine (we use butter though) another thing I thought I'd mentin is that the cinnamon sugar does seem to be more than needed but in my house it goes into it's own little container and we use the leftovers for toast or oatmeal or even the next monkey bread:) Wonderful recipe and versatile!",
