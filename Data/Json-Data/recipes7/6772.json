I made this as the directions listed but I have a few suggestions. Sometimes I used less cream cheese so that when I rolled the cucumber the end could overlap and I didn't have to worry about anything spilling out. I also added more raisins since 2-3 didn't really seem like a lot. I didn't have any large carrots on me so I shredded 1/2 cup of baby carrots (24 servings = 24 tsp = 8 TBS = 1/2 c). As for chives breaking buy fresh as possible and as green as possible. I suppose not too many people made jewelery out of grass as kids but don't pull the chives too tight or they will break. Also do not use any wimpy/weak/shriveled chives as those tend to break the most when tugged. Since you are making each roll by hand it is a lot of work and time consuming. I also suggest placing finished rolls onto whatever you plan to serve them on to prevent the chives from untying between finishing and eating.",

I let them sit for 30 minutes in a colander and this drastically reduces the amount of water that seeps out while they sit in your fridge waiting to be served. Just make sure you sprinkle them with salt and don't use too much! You can also use this technique with eggplant and zucchini. I also crushed peanuts and mixed them in with the cream cheese and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Turned out cute and they taste great! The whole process took about 2 hours.",

I made them in the morning and let them sit in the fridge, that allowed some of the excess liquid to drain. They were a big hit, I'll definitely be making them again.",
