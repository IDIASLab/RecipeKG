Like any cake recipe I creamed the butter and sugar first and then added the egg. I then added 2 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 3 tsp ground cinnamon to the flour mixture which gave it great flavor. I decreased the brown sugar to 1 3/4 and still found the sauce a bit sweet. I added extra vanilla to the brown sugar sauce too. I might try adding apples next time. Over all great recipe but must finish entire thing:)",

Comes out really rich but according to my brother who is the one who was really craving pudding chomeur it is less rich than the one made with maple syrup he had at a restaurant. The cake part was not quite as good and gewy as the one he had at the restaurant but still very moist and syrupy on the bottom. His sweet tooth was nicely satisfied so was the sweet tooth of everyone else at the gathering! Great quick recipe thanks!",
