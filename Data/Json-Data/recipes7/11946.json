Like something you would see on the front of a food magazine. And the flavor is JUST LIKE OATMEAL COOKIES. As soon as I finished making these, I wrote this down on a notecard and put it in my permanent recipe file. Good job, jasper33!",

I halved the recipe (though I still used an entire egg) and used Sarah's tip to add a splash of vanilla extract.  I did not use nutmeg and used all 1% milk as we didn't have buttermilk.  I did need to add a bit more flour as the batter seemed a tad runny to me.  We didn't have raisins (which was fine by me :) ), but Mr. LTH would enjoy them even more with raisins next time, I'm sure.  I also chose to leave the oatmeal unground, as I like that added texture.  Great pancakes; thanks for the recipe!",
