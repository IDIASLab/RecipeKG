For those who are just learning how to use lemon grass, here's the skinny:\nLemon grass is very fibrous when not absolutely fresh. I grow it in a pot at home. Remove the outer leaves until you reach the more tender area inside. Very finely mince the pale, tender part for your recipe. Reserve outer leaves and tops. These can be used to give authentic flavor to Asian soups and broths and strained out. Don't waste them! If your lemon grass is all stiff and dry, chop and pour over a little bit of boiling water. Allow to steep then strain. You'll get the flavor for which there is no substitute. It also comes as a paste in tubes in the produce section which can be used bit by bit by keeping in your freezer. This is a wonderful ingredient so ask your grocer to order some for you .",
