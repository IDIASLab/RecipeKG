The variance to amount of flour can't be overstated or you get sticky glob with most all-purpose flour.  The brandy amount also needs revision as it is absent in the cooking detail, mead makes a great alternative.\nAdding milk after the sugar browns creates instant hard candy, so preheat and add slowly.  This is a great recipe, but the instructions are poor.",

It came out almost EXACTLY like what we had in Germany. I did have to make a few minor adjustments but this is a great base recipe: 1. I had to add quite a bit more flour because the dough was very sticky. I would say I added around to cup more flour during the initial mixing. Also I used the food processor to mix the dry ingredients but then I dumped it into a bowl and used an electric hand mixer to incorporate the wet ingredients. Once the dough started getting too thick for the mixers I mixed it with my hands and added flour until it formed a nice ball. 2. I let it rise for an hour it looked nice but I was in the middle of cooking dinner so I let it be for a while longer. After around 1.5 hours it rose very nicely. I think I would go ahead and let it rise a little longer than an hour. 3. I kneaded it until it was smooth rolled it out about an inch thick and then cut 8 circles with a drinking glass. I still had some dough leftover so I divided this up evenly and kneaded a little into each circle so all of the dough was used up. Next time I think I ll roll it into a log and cut 8 pieces with a knife instead so I don t have to re-incorporate the leftover dough. I let these rise for around 30 minutes flipped them over and let them rise for another 10 minutes (the bottoms seemed very sticky).",
