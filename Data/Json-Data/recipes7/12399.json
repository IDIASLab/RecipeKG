At 9 minutes i thought \"this can't be right it is going to be like toffee\" and took it off the burner and stirred the other ingredients in. Tasted great while hot but when I rolled it into balls and they cooled they became too hard to even bite into. It took serious boiling of water vinegar and baking soda to get the cooled mess off my pan! Joyce do you really cook this for 10-15 minutes?",

No matter how hard I push and pressed, the mixture would not form into a ball, it just crumbled. My recipe calls for an egg, which helps bind the mixture. This recipe I tried today seemed to have far too much butter. The mixture was flavorless to me. I read back over this recipe thinking I may have missed something, but I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll stick to my family recipe.",
