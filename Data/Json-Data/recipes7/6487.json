I think my ratio of sweet potato to squash was higher because I had a few old potatoes to use up which didn t seem to affect the flavor at all. The only ingredient off script I used was a little curry which worked with the other spices perfectly. Never buying squash soup at the store again - this was stupid easy and restaurant quality!!",
