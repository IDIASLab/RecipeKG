I made this the first time with fresh figs and regular whole wheat flour and it was so good that I was craving it after fig season was over. I always can my extra figs in syrup and just made this with the canned figs... It was still delicious but next time I'll remember to cut or omit the sugar since my canned figs were already sweet. Thanks for the great recipe!!!",
