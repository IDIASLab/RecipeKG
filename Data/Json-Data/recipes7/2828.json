And Godiva white chocolate liqueur which I used for this drink... wonderful. All of it thrown together with cranberry and pineapple juice is just... NOT good. Too sweet too strong strange flavor. Reminds me of my youth when everyone brought something to parties - it didn't really matter what and it was never \"the good stuff \" dumped it into a big tub and had at it. We weren't particularly picky then.",
