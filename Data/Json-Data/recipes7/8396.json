I can't remember if I saw it on the back of the marshmallow bag or the graham cracker box. When I made this I actually pressed the pie crust ingredients into a pie dish and baked it for 8 minutes. The directions are very simple to follow and it made a fabulous fluffy chocolate-marshmallow pie. VERY much like S'Mores. We inhaled this pie.",
