                "reviewBody": "I mixed these up a couple days before Thanksgiving and froze them, right in the pan after the 2nd rise but prior to baking them. Took them out of the freezer to thaw then popped them in the oven the morning after Thanksgiving. They were perfect! Moist and light, just the right texture with lots of cinnamon flavor and just a hint of pumpkin. My tip, as with any yeast bread, don't overdo the flour and don't overwork the dough. You need just enough flour for dough to come together and only use enough when rolling them out so that they don't stick. The dough should be soft and pliable. The only thing I changed was the icing, used my own recipe for cream cheese icing and sprinkled chopped pecans on top instead of the pumpkin seeds. I will definitely be making these again.",

I cut the flour down almost a cup, and also baked it for only 15-17 minutes, just until light brown.  Follow the rule to stop adding flour when the dough pulls away from most of the bottom.  You can always add more flour (even after it has risen until doubled in size), but once you add too much you can't take it out!  I also used a cream cheese frosting instead.  Tip: I used evaporated milk in place of heavy cream since I didn't have any.",

I know, some people would hate this, because it takes away some of the richness, but the brown sugar still carmalized, and I would probably do this again. Second, I had some left over flour mix, half corn meal, half almond meal. I used this when I rolled it out into the large rectangle. It's a great mixture for rolling. Third, the icing - I wanted it a little thicker, so I put 8 oz of softened cream cheese in my stand mixer with 2 cups of powdered sugar and mixed them well. I started to add milk slowly, to get the thickness I wanted, but had a crazy idea - the heavy whipping cream. I started adding that instead, and then mixed on 8 until glossy. The result was the most luxuriant, delicious frosting I have ever made. Everyone in my family loved it, and I will for sure be making this frosting again.",

I made them at night, and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  To help with the rise in the morning, I put the rolls in a cold oven, filled a shallow pan with boiling water and set it underneath for 30 minutes.  Then I took both pans out and preheated the oven.The reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the icing.  Mine came out lumpy both times I made it.  Next time, I am definitely finding a new icing.",
