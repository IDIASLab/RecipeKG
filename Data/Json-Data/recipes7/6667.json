After reviewing other comments, I added 2 things - double (triple) the almond extract and 3-4 oz of almond paste.  My almond paste was frozen, so I shaved them and mixed them into the flour/butter/sugar mix.  Please note that almond paste has sugar so you may want to reduce the amount of sugar.   The scones were pretty  and yummy; apricot and almond are good comb together.",

I also added a bit of powered sugar glaze for a touch of dessert sweetness because they turned out more \"cakey\" with less crumb than traditional scones.",
