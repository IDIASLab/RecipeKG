I only made 2 substitutions - instead of 3/4 c vegetable oil I used 1 stick of 'i can't believe it's not butter' and 1/2 stick of real butter; and instead of walnuts I used pecans. I had to \"crush\" my own pineapple b/c I only had cans of tidbits but the result was a similar output. I still measured everything out to the correct proportions. Made two very nice sized loaves. Great sweet flavor but not too sweet. Feels heavy and dense but bread is relatively light and fluffy for something of it's kind. Brought 1 loaf to work at 8am and by 11 it was nearly gone! No complaints or changes! (I'm going to have to make more of this to use up my zucchini!",
