I have some leftover, so I'm going to try it on a cream cheese chunk to have with some crackers.  Good job Wendy Marie.  UPDATE 4.16.12  Made another batch of this, and slathered it onto a ciabatta roll with turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce & tomato.  It was delicious.",

The other day I did it a bit differently, and I think it came out better. I sauteed the onions first, and once they turned translucent, I added BROWN sugar to them, and a dash of Worcestershire. I find that this gave it a richer taste, and helped it set up better in the end. If your a fan of caramelized onions, this is a jar to keep in the fridge! Don't be afraid to make chopping onions a family affair, because I guarantee you'll want to make more than one jar (works out be about 7-8 smaller onions per 12 oz jar when cooked down)!",

Then I added the vinegar, s+p and brown sugar, and let that cook down to that jam consistency. Yummy! Will definitely be making this again!",

We use it alongside pork,  meatloaf, steak, scrambled eggs, etc.  It takes awhile to make but well worth the effort.  I prefer using Balsamic vinegar over red wine vinegar also.

Only had 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar to make 1/2 cup. Can't be rushed though it did take about an hour and half from start to finish and worth the time. Enjoy!",

Then when I added the onions, all the moisture from them were pulled out and seperated. I persisted..thinking if I simmered the sugar would melt again, which it did, but the water never evaporated...I simmered for nearly an hour..even added more sugar to thicken...I ended up pouring the water off..and now I am left with nothing that looks like the picture. ugh",
