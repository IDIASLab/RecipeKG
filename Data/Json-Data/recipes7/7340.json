At twenty minutes with no leavening this was nowhere near set enough to take out of the oven. I also would decrease the sugars to 1/2 cup each as I prefer cookies that aren't so sweet.",

One thing that I wasn't crazy about was the oatmeal in them was a tiny bit odd in texture but thw next batch I mixed them extra hard and a bit longer and that broke up the oats enough to get rid of that texture issue. However the taste was spot on! I also had to bake a little longer as I used a 9x13 too.",
