For those who use Splenda instead of sugar, you can substitute Splenda and Splenda brown sugar blend for both the white and brown sugars. I like to use half and half of maple flavoring and butter flavoring so it mimics the butter-flavored syrup in the grocery stores. Once you make this, you won't ever go back to the stuff in the bottle.",
