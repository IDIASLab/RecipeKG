As soon as I added the toasted pecans the candy mixture turned into a solid mass! I almost threw it out. Instead I tried adding about 2 more tablespoons of maple syrup to the pot and put it back on low heat. It slowly broke up to the point where I was able to spread it on top of the bacon but not coat the bacon. The flavour of the bacon and the mixture together is divine. But next time I wont be adding the pecans to the mixture. I will coat the bacon in the mixture then coat the top of the dipped bacon with the pecans.",

I felt like it may have been too thick and some of it dried funky-looking. Granted I don't have a candy thermometer so I was winging it a bit. I'm also going to try this again cutting the bacon into bite-size pieces before I fry it. I felt like a whole bacon strip was a bit much (maybe if the candy is thinner it would be a good sized serving I don't know). Anyway will definitely make these again - thanks for the recipe!",
