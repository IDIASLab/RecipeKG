Made a few changes by adding 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and 1/4 cup of wheat germ, increased oats to 3/4 cup and cinnamon to 3/4 tsp., omitted oil and used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree and left out the white sugar and increased   brown sugar by 2 tablespoons. Used almond milk and apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Just added dried reduced sugar cranberries which is what I had and added some chopped pecans. With the additions it made 18 muffins and they were baked in 23 minutes. Very moist with lots of flavor and well received by my husband.",
