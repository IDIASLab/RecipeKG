I just added about 1/4 cup(eyeballed it), put it all in a blender for a few pulses, and I have to say, it is the best I've tasted.  Even my kids love it, and ask for it all the time.  Now I keep blue cheese in stock.  It is just ever so slightly sweet when you first taste it, then you get the nice tang following that, with the nice strong flavor of the cheese.  I have never cared for bottled dressing of any kind, I have always liked making my own because I like to be able to control the salt and sugar and it just is always nice and fresh.\nI wonder if the recipe might have been a typo or something.  Maybe it meant to be a half a cup instead.  This is the only reason as to why I had to give it a 4 star.  I also like adding to it chopped candied walnuts, chopped bacon, and chopped granny smith apples.  It just doesn't get any better.",
