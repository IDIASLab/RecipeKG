I know ovens are different, so 325 might work in someone else's oven, but this did not work in mine at all.  350 for an hour could've worked, but 325 for an hour--forget about it!  It had to bake for 1 1/2 hours before this bread came clean and was finally done.  If I try this again, I'll do 350 and check at 45 minutes.  It came out chewier than I like, and I think those cherries need coated in flour before going in the batter.  They all sank to the bottom. I'd also cut up the cherries next time--I don't think the recipe said to do that, did it?  Bf and I also didn't think  the bread had much cherry flavor except when you bit into a cherry.  I'd nix the milk and do the 1/2 c of cherry juice for a total of 3/4 c of cherry juice.  If I try this again, I'll do my tweaks and see what I think.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Changed the vanilla to almond extract added 1/2 cup more cherries and tossed the cherries in the flour mixture to coat to keep them from falling to the bottom. OMG!! what a difference those little changes made. My grandson ( who does NOT like cakes or breads asked for a second piece) Very happy with the outcome. oh and I added Almonds to the top for extra texture.
