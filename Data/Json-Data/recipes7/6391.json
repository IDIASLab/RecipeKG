I make roasted pecans twice a year and I have never cooked them with butter in the pan before it sounded good so thought I would give it a try.big mistake. After 35 mins the pecans were BURNED! The oven temp is too high and adding butter to the pan made them burn even faster! All nuts (including Pecans) have oil in them..no need to add more. I'll stick with 250 degree oven and no butter from now on!",
