I toasted the nuts, subbing in a little flax seeds for about a half cup of the sunflower seeds. I 1.5 times the ingredients to make enough but didn\u2019t want to open another ramen so threw in a couple handfuls of chow neon noodles I crushed up as I put them in. Anyway, I sincerely apologize I didn\u2019t have all the ingredients on hand, but it\u2019s yummy anyway. I honestly read through some of the reviews first and so added rice vinegar for the vinegar, sesame oil for the oil, and used miso in place of the sugar because I need to use that up before it goes bad. I will make this again and again, maybe someday to the letter of it. I still appreciate that it was posted.",
