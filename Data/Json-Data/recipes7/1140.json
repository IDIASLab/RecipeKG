The filling is very good but I recommend reducing the cayenne pepper because like this it is very spicy! maybe 1/2 teaspoon 1/4 would be enough. The dough is very moist and hard to roll. Maybe it would be better to use a pie shell recipe. I give it 4 stars because it tastes very good and looks pretty but it needs adjustments",
