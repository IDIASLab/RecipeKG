Although the dough turned out wonderful and tasty (5 's) the filling and streusel DID NOT! TOO MUCH FILLING AND STREUSEL INGREDIENTS TURNED INTO SYRUP. I think it needs to be cleared up as to whether the milk or creamer to be used is dry powder or liquid. I used 2% milk instead of creamer as suggested but it was NOT struesel. The filling oozed out & burned on the baking sheet & even reduced the amount to 2/3's of the recommended amount. I will use the dough recipe again but will look for other filling & struesl recipes.",
