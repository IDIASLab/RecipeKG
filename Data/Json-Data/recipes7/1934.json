I made it this week and thought the flavors were really nice together. I did add one chopped up sweet potato (for color and extra yum) and that added a nice splash. I also cut up the lamb into smaller pieces (the cuts were a bit fatty so I trimmed them down). The lamb turned out tender the sauce was really nice. We will make this again.",
