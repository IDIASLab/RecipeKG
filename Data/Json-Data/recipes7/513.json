I made it in hopes of duplicating house dressing at a family-owned Italian restaurant in our suburban town...it was close but not quite there. I used red wine vinegar instead of distilled and shallot instead of onion. Overall this was also too sweet which is why I only gave it four stars. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and go from there. I'm also going to try the same ingredients but sub thinned tomato paste or sauce for the ketchup...it won't still be your recipe this way but it might put me closer to the restaurant's recipe! EDIT: I have started making this with tomato sauce instead of ketchup and cutting the sugar in half and it's become my VERY favorite salad dressing! Thank you...I wish more people would give this a try.",

I also thought it was a bit thick like another reviewer and added a little less than 1/4 c water (estimated because I didn't measure). Overall great taste. My salad had romaine red onion cucumber bacon pieces feta crumbles and croutons. Loved every bite!",
