                "reviewBody": "So where do I start.... First off I do believe the Tommy's Recipe is worth making; but not to be eaten rather to be used as a base for other chili. With that said The two star rating is for the outcome of the original recipe. To call the final product a paste is quite generous. I would classify it more like a chili cake. This recipe contains way too much flour and the cooking process doesn't account for all of the flour in the recipe. The final product was dense and almost inedible. HOWEVER I took advantage of the density and the thickening capability of this \"chili cake\" and used it as a flavor and thickening base for another chili. If interested continue reading and take a look at the recipe I made using the Tommy's Recipe as a base. RECIPE 1. 1 small onion 2 TBS Olive Oil 3 Cloves of fresh garlic...pureed in blender or small chopper. 2. In large pot over medium heat saute puree for 3-4 minutes. 3. Add 2 TBS Chili Powder 2 tsp paprika and one large beef bouillon cube; saute until bouillon is dissolved. (make sure to stir as to not burn the spices) 4. Add 12oz of very lean ground beef to the pot and saute just until brown. 5. Add 1 TBS of tomato paste 2 cups of the \"Tommy's Chili\" and 1 cup of water to the mix. 6. Whisk mixture until well combined and let simmer for 20 minutes. NOW you have an excellent thick dense chili capable of using for hot dogs burgers or just eating straight.",
