I've never had the Caramel Macchiato drink (although I just may be tempted to now), so I have no clue if this ice cream tastes like it, but I'm telling you, unless you really detest coffee you will love this. No, I take that back - even if you don't like coffee, you will love this. The pairing of caramel and coffee flavors is just simply, dreamy delicious - something new for me. I like my ice cream rich (and most often with eggs) so I used half-and-half instead of the milk. Also, I've made ice cream often enough to know that a full cup of sugar would be waaaay too sweet, so I cut it back to 3/4 cup and it was simply perfect.  In fact, everything about this ice cream is simply perfect!  It is so rich, creamy and gooey it needs no topping or any other embellishment.  I didn't even wait for it to ripen (harden) in the freezer before eating it.  Because after trying a taste of it, I couldn't.",

It took 4 single serve packs to make 2 tbsn. We mixed thick caramel topping into the ice cream just before putting into the freezer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

(I used Smuckers Caramel ice cream topping) I layered it in a container like the directions say and after a few hours in the freezer I couldn't even see the caramel.
