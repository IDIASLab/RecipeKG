I left them covered with cheesecloth on the counter overnight and decorated the next day and packaged once the icing dried. They make great gift cookies. I didn't use the icing in the recipe but the cookis are great. Thank you tinybananadog for sharing this recipe.",

To me, and my friends, they resemble a grainy texture like corn bread and these cookies were not appealing.  Since I have no knowledge of gluten free flour, I selected an all-purpose gluten free flour and I might have not picked the right kind for baking??

                "reviewBody": "This recipe it was pretty easy ingredient wise; however I did use half gluten-free flour and half almond flour when making the dough due to my supply. After the dough chilled for an hour it was still very sticky and unmanageable. I would recommend leaving it in the fridge overnight. In addition I did not have any more gluten-free flour to use to roll the dough out (only the almond flour). Well that did not work at all because the dough was too soft. It was a giant mess so I ended up just making drop cookies. My recommendation is for drop cookies that is that the balls are spread very far apart. I think you should only have about six cookies per cookie sheet. I also put them in for longer than 10 minutes more like 12 minutes. They came out nicely at least the ones that didn't run together we're nice looking. The taste was very good. The recipe is overall a good recipe but people who make this recipe should know there may be problems if the dough is not chilled overnight.",
