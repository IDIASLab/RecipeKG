I added the zest of one lemon and cut the water in half and made up the difference with extra lemon juice. I also dotted the upper crust with little pieces of softened butter (about two Tbsp) and sprinkled it with about two Tbsp of superfine sugar. Next time I'll increase the recipe by one and a half times as I thought the ingredients were a bit sparse for a 9x13 pan. Grandma's were thicker as I recall. Great recipe thanks for taking me back to my childhood!",
