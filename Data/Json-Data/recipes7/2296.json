This recipe was my first attempt and it was actually very good! It was all the wonderful flavors I remember from Chinese restaurants on the coast and WAY better than any of the slop they sell out here. I made some minor changes depending on what I had to work with. I couldn't find potato starch to save my life so I used tempura flour / rice flour. It seemed to fall off a bit during frying so I'd try the potato starch if you can get it but the pork still turned out great and what remained of the batter was delicious. I added in baby carrots with the other veggies as I love carrots in my sweet and sour pork - they were great! I thought the sauce needed a little extra citrus kick a little perking up and brightening so I added about 1/4 cup of grapefruit juice that I had in the fridge and it was just awesome and perfect. Finally I couldn't find any hot peppers at any grocers here (you see what I mean about where I live) so I went with dried ground cayenne. It was a bit too spicy not quite the right flavor... but still good. If you have to use the dried spice stuff instead of fresh it will work and be tasty just make sure you don't overdo it. As far as the recipe goes it was delightful! It was a lot of work to do but none of it was difficult to manage. The pork turned out WONDERFUL crunchy on the o",

                "reviewBody": "Thanks Betsy - Great recipe! I have another excellent S&S Pork recipe from this site but was intrigued with the double-frying of the pork in this one. Being a true carnivore I used 2 pounds of pork (boneless country ribs trimmed of fat) so I doubled the marinade and the egg for dredging. Everything else was kept as written. The pork bits had a very nice crunch to them and the sauce was not the sickeningly-sweet stuff that so many recipes make. At first I thought there might be a little too much vinegar in the sauce but even that ended up just right. I served the sauce over rice topped that with the pork bits then drizzled a little more sauce over the pork. My guest said she has never had such well balanced flavor in a sweet and sour dish. PS: I really couldn't tell the difference in the crunch between the pork bits that had been fried twice versus those that had had taken only one trip through the hot oil but it may be more in the way they absorb (or rather do not absorb) the sauce.",

I improvised a bit to assure the meat would stay crispy by only adding the meat on top of the sauce at serving time (not stirring it in and cooking as the recipe states). I also improvised due to the lack of some of the ingredients. I stir fried the bell pepper with carrots and yellow onions and my pineapple substitute was pineapple chutney but I could have skipped it all together as the sauce was sweet enough without it. Thanks Betsey for a new way to cook the same old pork chop!",

The potato starch makes it really crispy instead of soggy like regular wheat flour can get once it is mixed with a sauce. The only changes I made was that I used a small onion that I did a rough 1/2\" chop on instead of the green onions and I left out the cayenne peppers only because I didn't have them. I suppose I could have substituted some Siracha hot sauce but it was so good without it I didn't add it. I also used half a red bell pepper in addition to the green pepper. I would suggest that you do all of your chopping ahead of time so that when your frying is done you are ready to stir fry the veggies. My husband loved it and thinks it's better than a restaurant dish!",
