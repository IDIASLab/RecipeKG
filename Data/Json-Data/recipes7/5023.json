I love it with cranberries and vanilla yogurt and sliced almonds on top ( add almonds 1/2 way thru cooking so they do not burn). Make it with mixed berries or oranges or bananas or just about anything you can dream up. And with so many flavors of yogurt the combo's are endless. Also try a crumb topping with or without nuts. This is such a great basic recipe to play with. I've done so much with it and it alway's turns out great and moist. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe It's in my \"Special\" cook book now!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent! I made this cake a couple of days ago with minor changes (which sometimes is only due to what similar ingredient I can find in my fridge). First I bake alot with spelt flour (dinkel in german) I only use butter and full raw sugar. I like the taste of all these 3 ingredients in a cake. I didn't have yoghurt so I used sour cream. The plums I only halved and pitted and I used about 8 - 10 plums. Followed the procedure here batter should be somewhat firm on the drier side which is good because the plums will cook and exude delicious juices making the cake wonderfully moist. Poured batter into cake tin topped with the plum halves cut side down starting from the outside circumference ending in the middle with some space inbetween each half (depending on how many plums you have on hand or if you really like plums alot;-)) When the cake is baked the plum halves will sink somewhat as the batter rises and you will have a beautiful cake with deep red dollops. I did sprinkle a bit of sugar before baking but my final finishing touch was to warm up some plum/cinnamon compote I made last season strain to use the syrup to brush over the cake top making the plums pop (visually and tastefully too (pardon the pun)). Cinnamon and plum is a beautiful mellow christmasy combination. You could also use a teaspoon of cinnamon for the batter if you wish for a stronger cinnamon flavor. Thank you for the recipe. FYI there aren't even crumbs leftover!",

Consequently I had a lot more plums than the recipe called for and used them all (approx. 4 cups) I added blueberries and used vanilla yogurt (it's what I had). My only issue with this recipe was that it took longer to cook but I think that was due to the extra plums and is therefore not a fault of the recipe but a fault of mine for altering it. I made a loaf and 12 muffins and like it best in muffin form...yum! For anyone who knows what Tim Horton's is this reminds me of their Fruit Explosion muffins only better =)",
