I made a photo of the ingredients, but forgot to photo the backside of the recipe card and it had the oven temperature and time to bake and this one is almost exact to the one I truly love. My recipe didn\u2019t add any fruit other than the raisins in the Raisin Bran and no cinnamon and I only used between 1 and 2 cups of sugar. I have not added cinnamon before now but I will try it. You can use what you want for maybe a couple of muffins and keep the dough in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 weeks and it bakes as if the dough was just made. Whether or not you add the fruit and cinnamon this recipe is fabulous.",
