The roasted vegetables also make a great side dish that goes with any meat. They can be made a day in advance. I often bake a double batch and set half aside to go with another meal.",

There is plenty of time to do that while the vegetables are roasting. The cheese on the top forms a thick layer that is almost like another noodle layer. My family liked this dish but not all of them went back for seconds which is what they would do if they loved it.",
