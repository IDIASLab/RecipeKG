It's tender, sweet and moist, perfect as shortcake, but I could easily see this as cupcakes too.  Even a 9x9\" cake tends to be too much for Hubs and me, so I baked these in a 6-heart shaped individual Wilton cakelet pan, which yielded 12, perfectly portioned little cakes.  One or two per serving is quite sufficient and the rest I simply froze for quick future desserts.  The recipe is perfect as is - those grandmas sure did know what they were doing!",

I sprayed a 9x9 baking dish sprayed it with non-stick spray put down parchment paper sprayed again and it came out of the pan beautifully after cooling 10 min. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I also had to keep it in the oven longer. In total almost 50 min in the oven for a toothpick \"inserted into center comes out clean\". It's late and I'm really tired BUT..I put my strawberry sauce and homemade whipped cream on top of a slice of it while it was still warm and my tummy is ooooooooh so happy! YUM! I would like to experiment with this recipe. Like adding perhaps 1/2 tsp of vanilla next time maybe sub half the shortening with butter. Just for fun NOT because it needs it. OH also DO NOT skimp on the sugar. Thank you! ps..I'd love to know why it's called Cottage Pudding cake lol",

I still wasn't convinced when I made the batter, still wasn't convinced when the cake was baked but was overwhelmed when I put it all together because it made the best ever strawberry shortcake! Outstanding!! It's sorta like a cross between a sponge cake and pound cake, not one or the other but both somehow. It soaked up the liquid from the berries, had a perfect crumb, was moist, slightly sweet and just made the dessert. On it's own it doesn't seem to be anything special but when combined with sweet juicey fruit and whipped cream it's perfect. This would be good with peaches too. Thanks Kaylene for sharing your Grandmother's recipe! It's a keeper.",

It combines the sweet, delicateness of cake with the heartier texture and outer crust of biscuits.  The crust on this cake was actually the best part -- an almost caramelized, lightly crunchy exterior.  Awesome!  \n\nI did use butter instead of shortening, which I suspect helped with the yummy carmelizing on the crust.  I put it in an 8\"x11.5\" pan (all I had available), which I'd sprayed, lined with parchment and sprayed again.  It needed about 33 minutes to come out toothpick clean and was perfect that way.  Came out of the pan with the crust in tact and beautiful.\n\nI usually find strawberry shortcake bases too bland or too tough and biscuit-like. This one was none ot those things and will be my only base for shortcake from now on!  Thanks for the great recipe!",
