Don't rely on the traditional stick test for doneness in this recipe; the brownies will continue to be gooey even after baking. For easier cutting, place glazed brownies in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours.",

It is more like a fudge than what you'd commonly know as a traditional brownie - like the ones from a box. They are very rich and very dense. My husband thought they were great; he is a chocolate lover. I am not a chocolate lover therefore I found them to be a little too rich for my taste. I made them EXACTLY as the recipe stated - only exception was I only put walnuts on half of the recipe. I baked them for 40 minutes and yes as stated you cannot use a toothpick to determine if they are done. I decided to ensure they were done by letting them bake on the longer end of the recommended time and they turned out perfectly.",

You brushed on very little during the demo & I am curious if you added more before freezing or added more when it came time to thaw them out. They look divine. OMG my mouth is watering.
