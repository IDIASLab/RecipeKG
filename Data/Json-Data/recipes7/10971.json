I wanted to make 2 so I doubled the recipe but when I put it into the pans I realized I only had enough to really fill ONE jelly roll pan? I semi-quartered 11 plums which was the perfect amount for my pan. The crumb topping was not at all like I remember my German mother's crumb topping.The other thing that REALLY seems off is that my cake started to BURN on the bottom in just under an hour. How could anyone bake this for an hour and a half?!! My oven never has any issues with other recipe bake times so I don't think it has anything to do with that. Honestly I was confused as soon as I read the instructions to bake it that long. I should have followed my instincts. Instead I had to wait to smell burning cake in my house to actually go take it out. Then I had to cut the bottom burnt part off the entire cake. Those who tried this seemed to enjoy it but I know I should be able to make something much better. And without so much of a hassle.",
