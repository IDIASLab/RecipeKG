Standard tried and true ingredients as well as their measurements and clear and accurate directions. I made half a recipe in an 8x4\" loaf pan with a few minor modifications since I wanted a lemon pound cake: for half recipe I omitted the vanilla. I used 2 T. fresh lemon juice and enough milk to equal the 1/2 cup called for. Rather than split a half egg I just used 2 eggs. I also added about 2 tsp. lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Bake about 50-55 minutes. Perfect lemon pound cake with a dense yet tender crumb that's neither too dry nor too greasy (I've tried one of those on this site!). Good reliable recipe.",

(it is too bad the tile doesn't call it pound cake) I loved how easy the recipe was and also it's great that I didn't need anything \"extra\"- this is all stuff I keep in my house all the time. Very flavorful moist dense cake. I made in a 10\" tube pan and turned it out while still cool and added my favorite lemon glaze- 1c sugar 1/3 c lemon juice and brushed it on while still warm. Once cooled it makes the outside a nice crispy texture and adds good flavor. I cannot wait to bake this again! I bought it to my ladies bible study and it was the first cake I've brought that was all gone! Very great recipe!",
