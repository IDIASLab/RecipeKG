I microwaved the potatoes yesterday for 7 minutes and they were totally cooked so check for doneness early or you may end up with mashed sweet potatoes. We particularly liked the ginger-orange juice combination gave it just the right zing! Mixed everything together today baked for 15 minutes and had a really delicious side dish for our pork tenderloin. Keep this one in mind for the Holidays as this would be a perfect complement to a turkey or ham. Pamela thanks for sharing not only a delicious recipe but an easy one too. We really enjoyed it!",
