I would probably double it from the start next time. I also used apple cider vinegar because that was all I had. I'm sure it changed the flavor a little but like I said the flaver is excellent!

After looking through several recipes for inspiration I settled on this one because I like the idea of sweet and sour greens. So we subbed pancetta for the bacon and apple cider vinegar for the vinegar (because I prefer it when cooking). I also added in some diced onion for more depth of flavor. Otherwise I followed the recipe. They turned out great. I thought they might be a tad sweet but my husband who is from the South assured me they were just right. I still might decrease the sugar just slightly next time (1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup) just to cut back on the sweetness. (Unless I'm also serving something like black-eyed peas or beans that will help cut the sweetness.) I served these with \"Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread\" (also from this site) and chicken wings. The cornbread dipped in the pot juices from the greens was delicious!",
