The texture (as appears in the picture) was very uniform,not too dense, and did not crumble- slices well fresh out of oven. Succeeds in being sweet enough, but not too much so. It's a keeper! \n\nSingle-bowl method: blend all dry ingredients together, add wet, stir vigorously with fork until well blended (you should see just a few bubbles on top). Pour immediately into prepared pan. I used glass and it browned  nicely. \n\n*Note: I used oil rather than margarine, which we don't keep- worked fine. Also, I didn't add the jalepeno this time... you can do that or not depending on your mood. It's a great basic recipe.",

First off let me admit that I altered the recipe (1 can or creamed corn in place of 1 cup of the milk and 2 eggs instead of 3 plus the 7 1/4 x 11 3/4 pan I had avail) which I'm sure made a difference. Took an extra 7 minutes in the oven and was a little crumbly--but if using the 3-bowl method gave it the rise and great taste that it has it was worth a few extra dirty bowls!!! I'd add an extra jalapeno to my next batch though...",

I did not use jalapenos, and I'm sure they would've helped make the bread tastier, but I thought the batter needed some more flavour anyway. I added paprika, ancho chile powder and chipotle powder. If you find the right ratio, it makes the dough itself tasty. I also cooked some bacon and threw tiny crispy pieces into the bread. Then, I used the bacon fat instead of butter. It came out great. I do wish I could've used jalapenos (picky eaters here,) and I think some cheddar on top would go great. Overall a good solid cornbread recipe. I will definitely use it again.",

Hubs said he prefers it sweeter, so sweeter it was.  (Funny it should make a difference to him at all, since he\u2019s no real corn bread fan in the first place)  But this was a pleasant surprise for both of us \u2013 I did give it a taste and it wasn\u2019t nearly as sweet as its title would imply.  As for Hubs, he enjoyed it more than I thought he would and I\u2019m thinking it was the added interest of the jalapeno that was the deciding difference.  (Due to his sensitive innards I used just half the amount called for and it was just right \u2013 even if you don\u2019t have sensitive innards!)",
