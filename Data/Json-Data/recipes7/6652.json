Granted this adds an extra 10 minutes to the recipe but I d rather be safe than sorry. Should you choose to do this be sure you are constantly stirring so you don t end up with scrambled eggs and thoroughly chill the mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients and adding it into the ice cream maker. I used previously made praline pecans so the salt was eliminated and I replaced one cup of light cream with one cup of heavy cream for a creamier texture. I also used more than a drop of maple flavoring because I love maple flavor. This was excellent. You ll be licking the beater trust me. Added note: This ice cream didn't last 24 hours in this house.",
