I wasn't sure I was going to like the lemon mixed with the cinnamon but I'm so glad I gave it a try.  This is a cute, soft, buttery little Snickerdoodle of a cookie with just a hint of  fresh lemon.  No, actually this is more cinnamony than a Snickerdoodle because there's cinnamon in the dough here.  I also generally don't like soft cookies but THIS soft cookie is gooood.  My only criticism, and it's a small one that in no way affects the cookie, is that there was probably twice as much of the cinnamon-sugar mixture than I needed.  I'll consider it that I'm ahead of the game, because now I have a batch of cinnamon-sugar all mixed up and ready to go for the next time I make these or maybe to sprinkle on muffins!",

After they cooled completely and my husband and I had about 5 apiece, I put them in a big ziplock bag because I wanted these soft cookies to stay soft. I thought they were good last night, but not spectacular. And not as good as the other reviewers thought they were. Well, today I reached for one and now I DO think they are spectacular. Soft, buttery little mounds of cinnamon/lemon deliciousness. However, I do have a problem with how few cookies this recipe actually makes.  I doubled the recipe as I intended to send some to my grandkids. Even doubling the recipe only yielded 70 cookies. And I made them quite small, only forming the balls to 1-inch size. The picture accompanying the recipe shows a much larger cookie. It is, unfortunately misleading. I should have gotten 120 cookies by doubling the recipe or at least over 100. And these came out so small they looked like dog treat cookies. But for the discrepancy in the number of cookies, I would have rated this cookie 5 stars. Any ideas as to why some bakers got many less cookies from this recipe? I stuck to the recipe except for doubling it and I used the adjustment feature Allrecipes has to change proportions.",
