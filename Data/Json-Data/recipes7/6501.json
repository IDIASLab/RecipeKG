However I rated it 4 stars because it's a great combo that can easily be tweaked to greatness. I added 6 TBS of vinegar and 6 pks of nutrisweet plus LOTs of salt and pepper. ( I added it 2TBS of vinegar at a time and kept tasting it until it tasted the way I thought was good) The basic recipe does have a hint of the sweet and sour but it's very faint. I think using the greek yogurt with it's tanginess would help. I suggest making it with 1/2 yogurt and otherwise per recipe then just tweek it until it has the taste you like. Certainly a healthy dish. Thank you for sharing it.",
