If you forget them in the freezer like I did. just let them sit out for 15 minutes of so and then they will be ready to cook. The only change I would make with these is due to the texture of the filling.. it's very soft and I would like some firmness in there too. I added some diced ham to a few of these and that is what it needed for my taste. This is a great way to use up Thanksgiving or Christmas leftovers",
