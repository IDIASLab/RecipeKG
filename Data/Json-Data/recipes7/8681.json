The sauce was pretty runny so like another reviewer said it might not be necessary to add the 2nd addition of fruit juice. The citric acid in the mandarin oranges worked well by keeping the apples from browning. I ended up throwing some mandarin oranges in too. By the way my picky kids and husband asked what the sauce was. I told them it was \"a kind of sweet cream sauce\".",
