I did however soak the cake in some Godiva chocolate liquor for an adult twist. Then did everything above. I added an eighth of a teaspoon of orange extract to the canoli mixture also (only because I didn't have any orange on hand). It gave it just a little more depth of flavor. Very delicious recipe indulgence!",
