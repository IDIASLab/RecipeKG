Instead of ham I used smoked turkey legs and instead of beef broth I used chicken broth as well as added one table spoon of green seasoning. However, you will need to cook the smoked turkey with the broth on high for 90 minutes, shredding it then placing it back in the slow cooker with the greens and the rest if the ingredients omitting the skin from the smoked turkey. This is awesome!!!",

When it's too much or she has no time to cook it, it passes on to me.  So what do you do when a big bag of mustard greens is given to you?  This recipe is the answer.  Made without the spice (mustards are plenty flavorful already), I cannot think of a better way to prepare greens.  This rivals Glory Food!",

I cooked it for a few hours on high, then refrigerated overnight and cooked several more hours the next day. I just cooked until the greens were soft. I will be making this one again.",
