I couldn't find the Jif brand so I used a regular chocolate hazelnut spread and added 2.5 TBS of strong coffee to it to get the coffee flavor. I used low fat cream cheese as well.Also for the bottom layer instead of wafers I used oreo cookie crumbs. My muffin pans would only take 1 TBS of crumb mixture and there was just enough for 12 individual cakes. Also I just used regular muffin pan liners. Definitely have to chill or the cheesecake is a little soft but otherwise tastes great.",

The ONLY thing I did differently was use regular hazelnut spread (my local grocery store doesn't have the cappuccino flavor). I then added a package of Folgers instant mocha cappuccino powder to the mix. For the chocolate wafer cookies I just removed the filling from some Oreos people really seem to like that flavor you can only get from an Oreo crust! In the three times that I've made them I had to bake for more like 23 minutes. Tips for beginners: cream cheese MUST be room temperature to blend and fluff properly. Same for the eggs. Extra vanilla never hurts??. If you don't have the right kind of pan to make a water bath just fill an oven safe dish with water and place it on the bottom rack of your oven as soon as you turn it on. This last time that I made these I added a sprinkle of mini chocolate chips to the top of each cake before serving it added even more chocolate flavor as well as some texture.",
