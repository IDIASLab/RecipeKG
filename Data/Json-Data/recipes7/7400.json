This is a FAVORITE recipe of ours - made specifically for whenever I make pulled/shredded pork or chicken! The sweet - but not overly sweet coleslaw- compliments the salty/smoky flavors of the pork/chicken. It also works GREAT for fish tacos!  I always come home with an empty bowl! Keep, repeat and enjoy!

I added in a hefty pinch of garlic powder (family not-so-secret secret), about the same in kosher salt, and lots of freshly ground pepper. This was so delicious that it only fed 2 adults. In fact my husband has seconds and wanted more and there wasn't any. The next time I will fix the entire batch for only 2 of us and stretch it over two days. I only let this sit about 3 hours while the ribs baked. I stumbled onto this recipe by accident when I couldn't find my usual one and this one had my name so I had to try it... sooo glad we did! This went perfectly with bbq baby back ribs. This is a great basic recipe and it's easy to personalize and make it your own. Loved this!!!",
