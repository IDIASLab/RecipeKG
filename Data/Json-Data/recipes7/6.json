I used half white and half brown sugar and, because I wasn't keen on the cloves, substituted pumpkin pie spice. I added about 2/3 c. dried cherries (really nice!) and glazed the warm bread with 1 c. powdered sugar and 2 T. half and half. All in all a good bread, and pretty too, but I think next time I might try adding about 2 T. of oil to the batter for additional moistness without sacrificing that great buttery flavor.",

I'm talking the kind of dry that you can't eat it without something to wash it down. The flavor was fairly good but not great. I barely taste the apples but maybe I didn't use enough. \"Two apples\" is so vague. It would help if the quantity was a little more definite such as one cup of chopped apples or two 3-inch apples or something like that. The apples I had on hand were Golden Delicious and they were tiny apples so I used three of them. An hour in my oven was a little too long--it was slightly overdone..........................................UPDATE: I made a second loaf with the following changes: Added 2 tbls. of oil 1 tsp. vanilla 1/2 c. raisins 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. Oh and just so I would have a point of reference I added 1 cup of chopped apples (which happened to be almost exactly the 3 very small apples I used the first time). This time it came out moist and good. Sadly this time I UNDERcooked it because my husband was in a hurry for us to leave so I took it out at 45 min. Obviously ideal time in my oven is between 45-60 min. Still couldn't really taste the apples..maybe the cloves overpowered it. With these alterations I would rate this recipe a 4 star.",
