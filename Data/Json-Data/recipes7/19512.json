The dough was very sticky and I was worried about adding too much flour, so I shaped the dough into a log, then cut into slices. They still needed a bit of shaping. I also skipped the wax paper and just generously sprinkled the cornmeal on the cookie sheet. I also sprinkled the tops with more cornmeal. I cooked on a greased griddle set to 350, and 6min per side. They were everything I want in an English muffin. Crispy outside, full of holes, and a nice tang. I recommend doubling the recipe because they go fast!",

Luckily I found another recipe on here that recommended a *greased* griddle medium heat for ten minutes PER SIDE. I ended up closer to 12 mins per side, but they finally weren\u2019t dough in the middle. I don\u2019t know what went wrong, but this recipe was a giant fail for me. Not making again.",
