Cinnamon, poppy seed, or walnuts are a traditional filling.  Her recipe is for cinnamon, but one of my favorite ways is to break from tradition and use a cocoa/sugar/butter/vanilla mixture.  It's delicious, especially when the leftovers are toasted and buttered!",

I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added the whisked egg, vanilla, and butter. After that had combined well, I added the combined flour and salt. After that had combined, I took the submitter's advice and added dried Craisins. I had to add an additional 1/2 c. flour to get the dough to jump on the hook, but once it did, I let it knead with the hook for about five minutes or so. I then let it rise in a greased metal pan on my warm oven, covered with a moist towel, for an hour. After that, I divided the bread into two loaves, rolled it out and added the butter and brown sugar. I formed it into loaves and set them in the loaf pans and covered them again with the moist towel and let them rise for a second time for about fourty-five minutes. It only needed to bake for about a half hour. I don't usually time my breads, you just kind of know after a while. They smell done. This was a fun bread to make and smells out of sight when baking. Quite the stress reliever. No way you can be upset when smelling a wonderful sweet bread baking! Thanks, Valerie. NOTE: I did use unsalted butter, lowfat buttermilk, organic flour and brown sugar Splenda. For those of you who are timid bread makers, just go for it. I used to be, but now I really enjoy making bread by hand. Use your Kitchen Aid. It cuts your work in half!",

Being a born and bred Hungarian I have had this before. I did \"tweak\" the method a bit though. I don't have a stand alone mixer so I used a food processor which meant that it didn't need as much time in kneeding. And to help the process of rising I used a tip which I learned while making some bread: I put the dough in a bowl covered it and let it rise in about six inches of warm water. I did the same when the dough needed to rise a second time but instead a put it in bread tins! It really worked and the dough was great!",

I decided to proof my yeast for 10 minutes in the warm milk with the sugar and it is a good thing I did that because my first pack was dead! I added the egg vanilla and (unsalted)butter to that and then mixed in the flour and salt. I don't like to use a mixer when I'm only making one loaf so I kneaded my dough by hand but besides that I followed the rest of the directions and it was done in exactly 30 minutes.
