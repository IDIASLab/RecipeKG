Followed the recipe except while I was peeling and coring the apples I poured some pasteurized orange juice (not from concentrate if that matters) over the cut apples (2 large Gala and 3 small Rome) to keep them from browning (about 3/4 to a cup) while I finished preparing the rest of the apples. Once finished with the apples started mixing the dry and wet ingredients. The batter came out very crumbly so I poured some of the juice from the prepared apples into the batter to make it come together (MUCH better). Folded in the rest of the juicy apples and poured into glass baking dish (9x13) sprayed with baker's joy. Used a silicon spatula to push any protruding apples down into the batter and put in the oven for one hour. I AM NOT a baker normally but this cake is AWESOME!!! The hardest part is preparing the apples but it's DEFINITELY worth the effort. I'll be making this again and again! Thanks to the poster and all the previous reviewers. This cake tastes like the Jewish apple cake my late mother used to make...thanks for the fond memories!",
