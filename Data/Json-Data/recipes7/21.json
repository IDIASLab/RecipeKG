I glazed it with 1/3c lemon juice mixed with 1/2c sugar by immediately poking holes in the bottom of the cake while it was in the pan after baking, then brushing glaze as well on the top after removing it from the pan.

The cake rose right to the top edge of the tube pan, but I did have to let it bake about 20 minutes longer than specified, so be sure you test it with a wooden skewer before assuming it's done.  I followed the recipe as written with only a few minor changes: added one teaspoon vanilla extract in addition to the lemon flavoring, didn't measure the lemon zest - just used the zest of one large lemon, and added about a cup of diced fresh cherries I had and needed to use. I tossed the fruit with flour, and this kept them distributed throughout the cake without sinking.  The cake has a wonderful flavor and texture, and is easy to prepare.  This is a good basic pound cake recipe, and you could experiment with other extracts and berries.  I'm adding this to my pound cake repetoire!",

I've made this twice and found that there's too much batter for a regular 10\" bundt pan so I leave almost 2 inches to spare for the cake to rise in the oven.

I cut the rest of the cake into portions, wrapped each piece in plastic wrap (then stored in a ziploc in the freezer), and then reheated when I wanted a piece...again served warm (reheated in the convection oven) with a dollop of ice cream and strawberry topping. I also coated the blueberries with 1/4 cup flour and my blueberries did NOT sink. Like other reviewers, I used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of extract, and I think I even used a little more zest than called for. The lemon flavor was mild, but definitely yummy. As always, I used all organic ingredients. Great recipe! We enjoyed it. Thanks LDYBRD (Ladybird, is it?).",

The initial making of the cake was more than easy- it was literally a \"piece of cake\"  It took only about 20 minutes and then into the oven the cake went.  As previous reviewers did, I coated the blueberries in a little bit of flour to prevent them from sinking and it worked like a charm- the blueberries were evenly spread throughout the cake and none sank.  I then, once it cooled, spread a basic icing with a tint of lemon flavor on the top of the cake and it was delicious-  It had a light lemon flavor and the blueberries were simply magnificent.  Everyone raved and this recipe will most definitely be made again.  Thanks!",
