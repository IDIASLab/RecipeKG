One thing I will do differently next time - since i'm using premade, already flat rolled out dough - is to just tear off pieces of pie crust and loosly drop them into the cups, rather than roll it into a ball, then try and smooch and fit the ball into the cup. It over works the dough to ball it up first and then reform it to the cups, not to mention time consuming and frustrating. So just tear off a piece that looks about right and fit it in, and then touch up around the edges with extra dough if you need to.",
