Now, I know these were to be made into bars. But once I know I can make a dessert into individual sizes, I usually do that. I made these in a regular muffin pan, generously greased as the recipe stated (no liners needed) and as soon as they were cooled they literally popped out of the pan, perfectly! These baked up so nicely as muffins too and I baked for 25 mins. just as the recipe stated. As I bit into one, I did feel like I was enjoying a piece of heaven! I will be making these often and want to try these as mini muffins too. Thanks for sharing your recipe CookinBug!",

They reminded me of a shortbread cookie and a blondie combined...only better! I added all the optional ingredients because I love all of them and will actually use more cherries than called for next time. I didn't feel the chocolate chips overpowered these at all. They also only took 25 mins. in my oven (as stated in the recipe) but my oven is known to be extra hot so that could be why I didn't have any problems with the cooking time as other reviewers did. I am definately making these for my cousins wedding in Oct. and can't wait to make them for Christmas and use a combo of red/green maraschino cherries. Thanks for the AWESOME recipe Bug!:)",

They were very rich and moist with very nice flavor and mouth-feel. I cut them into bite-sized pieces for portion control!! Everyone at work loved them. I used a shiny 9x13 pan and 25 mins in the oven was perfect because these do continue to bake a little more than expected when removed from the oven. I think any more than that and they would have been overdone and dry. I will definitely make these again and again. UPDATE: These made 48 mini-muffins plus a little left over batter. They needed 16 mins in the oven. I greased the pans and they easily popped right out.",
