Either I did not use the correct pan size or my proportions were off, because the consistency did not turn out how I expected.  It was soft and there were not enough cashews...certain portions of the pan were just sugar/butter solidified. (I, like another reviewer, expected a brittle.  Ended up taking their suggestion and refridgerated for a few minutes.)",
