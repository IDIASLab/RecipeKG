I think it was the combination of the cinnamon and almond extract. Served it at my coffee gathering and even the 2 men who attend (and will eat just about anything) didn't like it. I do a lot of baking for the gang & everyone was surprised because that's the first time in 4 yrs I've made something that everyone didn't like. So I will stick to my cranberry walnut bread pudding.",
