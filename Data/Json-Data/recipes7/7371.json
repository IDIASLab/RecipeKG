I added 1/3 cup honey coconut oil and used 1/2 organic whole wheat flour along with the regular white flour. However the bread did not cook in 30 minuets.. ( maybe my oven?) I added on some time to see if it could become less doughy. I would highly recommend this recipe and as I bake it more I hope to rerate it! Otherwise next to perfect!",
