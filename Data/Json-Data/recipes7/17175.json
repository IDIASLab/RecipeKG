Allowed to cool, then mixed in raisins, cinnamon (only 1 teaspoon), and walnuts.  Precooking the apples kept the juices from making the pastry soggy on the bottom and assured that the apples were cooked completely.\n\nI made one strudel as the recipe stated and made another one with my changes.  The original recipe was overly sweet IMHO, the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon overwhelmed the strudel, and the apples were still a little firm. \n\nI folded the end of the pastry over the filling before folding over like an envelope, no fruit or juices escaped out the ends.",
