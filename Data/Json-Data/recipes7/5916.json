Using big Oster mixer on #5 (whip) it took about 15-20 min for sugar (Apriva)/veggie shortening/eggs/extract to be light and fluffy. Decreased speed then added sifted flour/baking powder/salt 1/2 cup at a time. By the time it was all in the bowl dough looked like medium to large crumbs. Added coconut and mixed by hand. Not able to use teaspoon so rolled dough in hand and broke apart to measure about 1 teaspoon. After baking then cooling cookies tasted powdery. Will leave on plate overnight and see if taste increases. I guess I had visions of coconut maroons on my tastebuds. Question? I've always sifted flour first then measured. This recipe says add flour and dry ingredients then sift. Sifting after measuring creates more volume. Was this my problem? I would have loved giving better review but at this time I can not. Will update later.",
