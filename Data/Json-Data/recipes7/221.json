It is great for the typical huge Portuguese family party or reunion, it is a very light meringue cookie, it is very simple, but I insist that you use an electric egg beater. This is very sweet, and has a hint of citrus flavor to it. If you don't use an electric egg beater, it will take you hours to prepare it!",

My grandmother made these with the left over egg whites from malasadas or masa. The recipe that I am reading shows 12 eggs. If you use the egg yolks you will end up with flat sweet scrambled egg cookies. I used egg whites not whole eggs sugar salt orange juice as instructed but added lemon rind because my grandmother added lemon rind to everything. I cooked mine for about an hour then left them in the warm oven for another 30 to 45 minutes. They were not as good as my grandmothers but she had 40 more years cooking experience than me.",
