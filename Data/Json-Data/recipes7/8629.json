I've taken a combination of a few of my favorite chili recipes and added my own personal touches to create a very flavorful, spicy chili. You can also sub dried basil and oregano for fresh, and bacon bits for crumbles; fresh is always a better flavor though. The longer it simmers, the better it tastes. Serve in bowls with Cheddar cheese and sour cream topping. Goes well with cornbread.",

JRay it's awesome!\" In sleuthing around the new & improved /snort/ websites collections I saw that I somehow never reviewed this recipe when I 1st made it nor any of the countless times that I've made it in the yrs. in b/t. It is a 5-star chili (spicy! thick! great as leftovers! freezes well!) as written but when I made it this last time I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce no bacon & dried oregano & basil (less than the fresh called for). Left it in the slowcooker for more like 6 hrs. as well. Chili can be such a blank canvas when you start w/ meat tomato bean and this one's seasoning and vegetable additions are spot-on.",
