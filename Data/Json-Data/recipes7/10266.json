I read the other reviews first and this is the adjustments I made. \nI added sugar to 1 cup, following according to the recipe, when I added the one egg I beat in 1 tsp peppermint extract. They were just a bit dry to roll but it worked out. I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper and baked that way,, seems to correct the sticky mess of the candy canes. It also took me 10 - 12 minutes to bake. They don't brown up much just a little on the bottom. I ended up with 4 dozen yummy cookies. \nThese turned out perfect will definitely keep for every year. Thanks for sharing..",

I used 1 tsp of vanilla and the full cup of sugar.  These did not keep a round shape. Next time I will put them in the fridge to harden a bit before making the balls.  Also my baking time for both was between 14 and 15 minutes.  48 cookies per batch.",
