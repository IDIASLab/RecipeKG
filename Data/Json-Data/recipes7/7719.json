The combination of milk and cornmeal adds a whole new dimension of both texture and flavour to the cake (and now I know why you Americans call it 'bread' and not 'cake'... it's much less sweet than a lot of other recipes good for those with more of a savoury tooth). The only thing I wish I'd done differently was bake it for 35 mins - 30 mins wasn't quite enough: so watch that tooth pick like a hawk!",
