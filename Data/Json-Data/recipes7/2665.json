I did the math for the sugars and did half and half of each so my cookies would be a lighter shade, like chocolate chip cookies. I also ground down the oatmeal in my blender to give it a less chunky consistancy. (We like our oatmeal cookies that way.) Instead of white chocolate chunks, I used white chocolate chips. The submitter suggested to preheat your cookie sheets  but I found that just preheating the oven was sufficient. Ten minutes at 350* lent to a soft, chewy cookie. Heaven in your mouth. Next time I'll double the recipe and share with my friends and neighbors. This would be really good with Craisins, too, I think. Next time, I might use all vanilla.",
