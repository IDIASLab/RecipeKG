She is the patron saint of Sweden so her day is celebrated widely there. A girl of the family will dress up as St. Lucia wearing a long white gown with a red sash and a crown of holly with candles (nowadays mostly just electric candles) and will serve the \"Santa Lucia Buns\" to the rest of the family. They can also be made with two overlapping \"S\" shapes to make a cross with curled ends. I often prefer to make my Santa Lucia buns with just a bit of large crystal sugar or Scandinavian pearl sugar (which is a bit harder to find). I also like the look of longer strands of Saffron they really do add lovely color and taste to the buns.:) Happy Scandinavian Baking!!!",

I may add candied lemon/orange peel next time I bake these to make them into a slightly more sweet breakfast bread...",

Here are some things that I learned making them the first time:\n*I wanted to make these for our family's St. Lucia Day breakfast, and so I made the dough the night before, let it rise, formed the rolls, and then put them on the pan in the fridge to finish rising overnight. This worked like a charm and we had hot rolls first thing in the morning.\n*I didn't have access to fresh yeast cakes, so I substituted 2 1/4 tsp instant yeast for each cake. This worked well.\n*I added 1/4 tsp cardamom and sprinkled the dough with pearl sugar, like other reviewers suggested.\n*I was using saffron stamens from Palestine, which are different than Spanish saffron (slightly less intense). I crushed them myself and ended up with 1/2 tsp.\n*I didn't divide the dough up beforehand, and just did it as I went. This means that my rolls ended up bigger than they would've if I'd divided them beforehand.  (I got one big pan full). I will pre-divide next time.\nTruly, these ended up delicious and moist and just *perfect* for our St. Lucia Day celebration. I think I will use it as my go-to sweet roll dough from now on. Thank you!!!",
