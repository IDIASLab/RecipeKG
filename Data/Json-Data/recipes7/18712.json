I have made it without the apples or using frozen cranberries. I enjoy it as a dessert and as a breakfast treat around the Thanks-Mas season. Loaded with antioxidants! I have also made a wheat-free version using nut flour. Serve plain or topped with ice cream, whipped cream, or a drizzle of heavy cream.",

It seemed like 1/4 cup of sugar when using an entire bag of fresh cranberries seemed like it would be a little too tart for our taste so I upped the sugar on the fruit to between 1/2-3/4 cup. I am glad I did because it was the perfect amount of sweetness for me. My husband still thought it was a little tart. I prepared the rest of the recipe as is. It wasn't a traditional crumble. Using an egg in the crumble made it more cakey against the fruit but I liked it that way. I did think the use of the white sugar in the crumble made the top too crunchy. I also think it could have used some extra cinnamon in the topping. With a few tweaks I think this would be a delicious crumble.",

Update 11/13/18 - Add a star! Was m-u-c-h better the next day chilled! The topping softened a bit and became really yummy. I'll now make this again and try some variations - pecans rather than walnuts maybe a touch of orange zest or oil. (King Arthur Flour has orange lemon and lime oils. Pricey but but worth it. Also try their Fiori di Sicilia - a blend of vanilla & citrus. My \"secret ingredient\" in many things.) Soak the raisins a little to plump them up. Definitely a thumbs up. Not 5 Stars because you have to wait a day to eat it.",
