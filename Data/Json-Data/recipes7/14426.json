I have had my young Korean friends try it, and they told me that it tasted just like how their mothers made it! It is a Korean side dish, banchan, but it's so good you can just eat this and rice for a quick yummy meal anytime. jangjorim can be served cold right from the fridge, at room temperature, or can be heated up in the microwave. Add fresh ginger, if you like ginger.",
