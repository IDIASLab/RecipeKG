I allow spices to simmer a bit longer before adding tea and simmer for a couple to three more minutes.I usually go for that dark amber color. Add evaporated milk and add more sugar if needed. You may prefer to use a fine hand-held strainer before serving. Traditionally it is served as is and the leaves just settle to bottom. Enjoy! And yes I agree.. it IS addictive because it is sooo yummy. Remember you can make this however you want until it is juuuuust right.:)",
