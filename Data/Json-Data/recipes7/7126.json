I used chocolate graham crackers for the base as I had that on hand, but otherwise adhered to the recipe. Then I piped buttercream onto each of the brownies. I was very pleased with the recipe--in particular,  I found the chocolate taste to be pleasantly intense but not overly sweet. The ratio of cocoa powder to sugar was perfect. Brownies were nice and crunchy on the bottom and chewy on the inside. I will be making these again.",
