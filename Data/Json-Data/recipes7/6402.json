They are a must with this soup to give it the full reuben flavor and you'll want to generously top your soup with them. Thanks for warming up a cold day with a yummy recipe!",

Maybe it would have been a 5-star for me if I'd used the full 1-cup of butter but since I'm always trying to cut bad fats (and salt) I just couldn't make myself use that much butter! As it stands I used just enough butter to sautee the vegetables (approx. 3 Tbsp.). I also did not use the seasoned salt as I didn't have any but I rarely use salt so I don't think I missed it. I had leftovers the day after and added additional sauerkraut which I thought provided a nice flavor boost. I think additional caraway seeds will help and I'll try that with my next bowl. I agree with the other reviewers who recommend making your own croutons if you can't find them in the store. They definitely add to the texture if not the flavor of this soup. Thanks Shannon for submitting the recipe. I don't know where Russ' Restaurant is but I definitely want to try this soup there.:-)",

I also couldn't find rye croutons at a store so I bought a loaf of rye bread and tore up a few pieces put some butter on them and then baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes. They turned out great and went well with this soup. I will be making this recipe again.",

I m not a fan of caraway seeds or Swiss cheese so I skipped the caraway and substituted mozzarella for the Swiss. I concede that I took away flavor elements on both counts. Next time I will add more corned beef possibly doubling the amount and maybe add a touch of Worcestershire sauce. Agree with others who felt the recipe does not need a full cup of butter. The half-and-half and cheese add plenty of creamy richness.",

I thought the addition of red peppers sounded odd but found that it is a necessary ingredient in order to create the Thousand Island dressing taste that is a must on any classic Reuben. Whatever you do don t skip the croutons! While the soup is good by itself it s the crunch of the rye crouton that has you craving the next bite. Even salad croutons will work if you can t find or make your own rye croutons. I used salad croutons that were made with black bread. Thank you so much shannon for sharing such a magnificent recipe!",
