I thought there was too much sugar, so I modified to the following: 1.5 lbs taro (2 cups of .5 inch cubes) 5 Tablespoons white sugar 1 Tablespoons brown sugar 1 can (13.5 ounce) coconut milk 1/2 teaspoon sea salt  Simmered until the taro was VERY tender, almost dissolving. Took about 20-30 minutes on low.   Note that the taro releases a lot of starch, thickening the liquid into a porridge-like consistency.  Will definitely make again.",
