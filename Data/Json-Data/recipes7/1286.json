I did leave out the ginger because of a good friend's allergy but all of my friends (at three different parties!) loved this dip! I served it with Snyder's Honey Wheat Sticks (shorter thicker and less \"glossy\" than regular pretzels) which were great since they were maybe a little better at picking up the dip and tasted great with it. I think this would also be great as a spread on a turkey sandwich or even as a side at thanksgiving. The kids liked it the same as they like applesauce!",

Since this dish is not as popular with the masses as it is with both me myself and a few of those close to me I have learned to freeze it in small batches so that I can bring small'sh portions of it to any gathering where I need to watch calories while others are not as inclined to do so. I make the cranberry sauce in a saucepan add the rest of the ingredients and blend it with a blender wand rather than straining out the skins and etc. Couldn't be simpler. It is also especially good with celery and turnips (ah there it is you can tell that I don't have a typical taste for food as compared to most other Oklahomans.... cheshire grin ). Anyway try this! If you like it it might be one of your favorite foods as well. I'm certainly not the only one who eats this when I serve it though my husband prefers cranberry salsa (ah yes the chips thing.... he does love his tortilla chips.......). I have thought that this might be appreciated more widely if it was served as a layer dip with sweetened low-fat/no-fat cream cheese (perhaps with orange juice concentrate or perhaps some dried orange rind) topped with some nuts. It might be well received that way with some triscuits or shortbread type cookies and apple slices? I'll try that sometime and try to remember to let you know how that went!",
