The only step I left out was to salt the cucumbers first to remove the liquid because I like my cucumber salad nice and juicy. Nor would I want to take the chance of the cucumbers ending up too salty even after rinsing them. The lemon juice instead of vinegar made for a very light refreshing salad with just the right balance of tanginess and creaminess.",

For the salt I tried 1/4 tsp. It yielded a scant 1/4 tsp of water. I thought they tasted to salty and briefly rinsed them. In either case make sure to dry them very well as to not water down the sour cream. I only had dry dill and used a 1/2 tsp. That seemed like a fine amount. If I make again I will skip the salting part and just add salt to taste. It gave the cucumbers too much of a limp texture unless fresh garden cucumbers work best with this method.",
