I added a 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries just because I needed to use them. I also had to use buckwheat flakes instead of rice flakes. We liked the end result but next time I will cut down on the sugar in both the mixture and the topping. The brown sugar really adds a nice earthy flavour and crunch to the topping. Thank you Kathy for sharing your recipe!",
