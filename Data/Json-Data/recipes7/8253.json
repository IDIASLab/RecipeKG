In fact I'll need to do a double batch this afternoon as per my order (you can't deny little granddaughters!). I got ten good-sized muffins from this all moist and yummy. I suggest letting them cool for a few hours to peel away the liners if you use them because they are so moist the papers stick otherwise. I followed the recipe using my own mix of pumpkin pie spice (recipe here on AR) and for the nutmeg I used a healthy dose of a special mix of apple pie spice that contains cardamom I was gifted by my friend Lissa. They took 25 minutes in the oven before the tops sprang back lightly. Thanks for making me popular with my family!",
