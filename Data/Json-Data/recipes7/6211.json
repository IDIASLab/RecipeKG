I used 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of Melt Organic Buttery Spread for the porc and marinated the tenderloin in a ziploc for over 24 hours. The marinade was incredible. I prepared the sauce but honestly the tenderloin was great without it. I did not skewer the tenderloin either. I grilled it whole 7 minutes to sear the first side over direct medium heat (keeping the grill covered) then 6 minutes on the second side. Finally turn off the heat keep the lid closed and let the tenderloin coast for 5 more minutes until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 to 150 F.",

I think the servings are off though as we only had 3 servings (each serving about 3 chunks of meat) after trimming the fat. I would recommend getting more than 2 lbs of tenderloins unless you're feeding 3 or less. Also we served it with grilled zucchini onion & tomato instead of rice - makes for a nice healthy meal.",

It sounds like a lot of differences from the original recipe but really they aren't that different if you look at it carefully. I served this with sticky rice (Calrose) and we loved every bite!
