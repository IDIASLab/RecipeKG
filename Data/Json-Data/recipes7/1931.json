        "description": "I've made tzatziki loads of times, but this is my best recipe yet! The two keys are the roasted garlic, and straining the yogurt for 24 hours to make it like soft cheese. Tzatziki is great with crusty bread, french fries, pita bread, baked potatoes, or with any sort of wrap such as gyros, souvlaki, falafel or kebab.  Also, I traditionally use fresh garlic, but this time I used ROASTED garlic. This made the tzatziki so much more flavorful, without that overpowering 'bite' that can come with lots of fresh garlic.",

Many of my friends are Greek and it was well recommended to use Goat Milk Yogurt (Greek Yogurt). So this time around I made it properly. Strained the Goat Yogurt for 24 hours. The thicker it is the better the outcome. Try it you won't be sorry.",

However, I did make sure to get as much water as possible out of the cucumber.  Also used dill (instead of mint) and 2 regular sized whole garlic bulbs.  Texture and weight were perfect! Loved that there wasn't mayo or sour cream in this recipe.  It's a keeper....am making more today!!",
