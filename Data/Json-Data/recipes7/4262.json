I also didn't have cottage cheese I did have ricotta (so weird it's not like ricotta is something I regularly buy) I mixed the ricotta with honey instead of the white sugar and also mixed in a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. The only downside is that after being cooked these have a short shelf life they turn kinda mushy after a couple of minutes and definitely tasted yeck when I tried to eat one I'd placed into the fridge for later. Oh well it was a simple and easy last minute treat. I think they would be even better with some fruit mixed in maybe a little spoonful of blueberry preserves or even better fig jam.",
