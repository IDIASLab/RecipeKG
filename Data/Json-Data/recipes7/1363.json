I make this dish all the time and - really - with this amount of cottage cheese (i use farmer's) i'd put only 1 egg and 1 tbs of semolina. It's not supposed to be rolled and cut! The point of adding egg and semolina is to get the cheese smooth enough so u can make PATTIES. I even omit the flour and semolina if the consistency of farmer's cheese is working for as is. Only cheese sugar pinch of salt and eggs. But it depends on your taste.",

We use farmers cheese to make these or tvorog wich is a russian pot cheese similer to farmers cheese. These should not be dry enough to roll out. If they can roll there is too much flour. Try straining the cottage cheese for a few hours first to get some of the liquid out and then follow the recipe. They should be dropped by large spoonfuls into a good amount for hot oil. Also sugar is to taste but try serving these with jam and sour cream. This is the traditional way of serving them. Some people put golden raisins in them as well. I personally hate raisins. It should be like a very very thick batter that you could shape with wetted hands. I just spoon it in and smooth the top with the back of the spoon. We also use farina cereal in place of the semolina and add some B.P. to make them puff a bit. 1/2 t should do it. Mix it into the flour and cereal before you add it to the cheese sugar egg mixture. Good luck and Nazdorovya!!!",

Maybe it would have been better to leave it more like a batter and spoon it into the skillet for frying.",
