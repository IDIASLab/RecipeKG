Great choice because I knew it would still be right up Hubs' alley. I scaled this to 8 servings to accomodate my 1-1/2 quart ice cream maker. For added richness I used my preferred ratio of 2 c. cream to 1 c. of half and half. After I chopped the (high quality) chocolate it reaffirmed for me I had made an excellent choice to keep my spoon out of the bowl - TOO much chocolate I thought! After mixing in the maraschino cherry juice (which kind of weirded me out) it wasn't quite pink enough for me so I added a couple of drops of red food coloring just to make it a pretty soft pink. I thought the amount of almond extract would be too much too but I thought \"Oh go for it. Who cares. You're not eating this anyway and you'll stay true to the recipe for rating purposes.\" I plodded on. I knew the base would be good - rich frozen egg custard just what I grew up with in Wisconsin and adore. I mixed the chocolate and cherries into the ice cream AFTER it was churned as my ice cream maker warns against any add-ins larger than a chocolate chip. I let the ice cream ripen in the freezer for several hours before I served Hubs his dessert tonight and strictly because I had to rate it tried a little spoonful. And then another. And another. Just like a creamy chocolate covered cherry cordial I thought! This stuff is awesome good.",

I live in Fiji and maraschino cherries are not available. I soaked dried cherries in rum to hydrate then followed the recipe. I used dark bittersweet chocolate and chopped it semi fine and added it when the mix cooled. To die for taste and the presentation is beautiful. Thanks for a gourmet treat that can be prepared the day before for an outstanding dessert treat!",
