When I want cobbler, I want something a little more complex and with a little more depth of flavor.  Maybe using brown sugar and/or vanilla would have helped?  Also disappointing was the consistency of it.  The topping was not crumbly and crunchy, nor breadlike (the two options for good cobbler topping for me).  It just kind of sat there as sweet, cinnamon-tasting mush.\n\nLike I said:  it tastes good, it was easy, and it might work in a pinch; but it was just not what I was looking for.",

One of the guys at work asked for Apple cobbler, so I chose this recipe. I'm not a big fan of baked fruit deserts normally, but I really just wanted to eat the whole thing, and not share at all, it was so good! I did share tho, and everyone at work really loved it. I brought it in for breakfast, and the only problem was that there was not enough! Everyone wanted a second helping! I recommend making extra!! I'm making it again this morning and I know everyone will love it! Just don't over mix your batter, and don't use melted butter, just soften it, and you will do great! I love adding my own touches to recipes normally, but don't change a thing on this recipe. So simple, and my first cobbler was a success! Now I'm cobbler queen!

                "reviewBody": "I did make some adjustments while creating this delicious dessert that I think may have improved the taste and texture. For starters I kind of messed up in the beginning when I mixed the flour, sugar, butter, and cinnamon. I mixed everything together except the sugar and I had to cut it in afterwards. I also added about a tablespoon of chopped pecans to the dough mixture for a but of crunch. I used an 8oz can of fried apples instead of fresh ones which cut down the prep time (but not the cooking time.) I layered the apples and dough mixture &  added a bit of flour as the recipe stated then put it in the oven at 350\u00b0 for 18minutes.  I'm so impatient i had to peek! And the dough still appeared gooey so I raised the oven temp to 400\u00b0 for another 18 mins. Then I let the cobbler sit in the oven (turned it off) for another 2-3 minutes before I removed it to cool on the stovetop. I think raising the temp gave the crust a more dense flakey texture than if id left it at 350\u00b0 and the result was delicious! I used a small Pyrex dish to bake it and the end result served 3-4 people. I even added a couple of oats (oatmeal) on the top because id always wanted to make Apple crisp. The and result was delectable! I guess a small mistake or alteration can make all the difference, and in this case it was a wonderful outcome!",
