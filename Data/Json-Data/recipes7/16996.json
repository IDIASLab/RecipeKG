I upped the bananas flour salt and baking powder by 50% I used applesauce as suggested instead of the oil (50% more) five large eggs just 1 cup of dark chocolate morsels (what I had in the pantry) two packs of chocolate fudge pudding and the same amount of sugar as in the original recipe. Baked in a large loaf tin for about 90 minutes. Turned out great but next time I will try it using one pack of pudding.",
