This classic, standard pound cake recipe is so popular and so enduring because it\u2019s delicious and turns out perfectly every time.  On this occasion, I used the batter for cupcakes for my grandbaby\u2019s Baptism.  I filled them about 1/3 full, dotted them each with 1/2 tsp. of seedless raspberry jam, then added more batter to about 3/4 full.  I baked them at 350 degrees about 23 minutes, then frosted them with a Vanilla Buttercream.  The combination of the cake, the raspberry and the buttercream couldn\u2019t have pleased me more.  The flavor variations in this cake are limited only by your imagination \u2013 in this case I used 1-1/2 tsp. of clear vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond flavoring;  but rum, coconut, orange, lemon are all just a few of the many interesting alternatives.  Bake this dependable pound cake recipe with confidence, and beware of those recipes with changes in the amounts of sugar or, most particularly, butter.  (Now, cross your fingers for me that these make it intact to Minneapolis tomorrow for Andrew\u2019s Baptism!)",

I bought a 6x6x2\" cake pan and thought the baking time would be significantly reduced due to the small pan. BOY was I WRONG! It took almost an hr and 45mins to bake out clean! and while my cake was level thanks to the damp towel wrap trick-- the top of the cake was like a crisp cookie and had lifted away from the cake below. I also greased and floured the pan very well and still had difficulty getting it out of the pan cleanly. There is no direction how long to cool it before unmolding and I did run a knife around the edge to loosen before overturning. I did 3 layers so I tried 3 different ways to grease/flour cool before freeing and different utensils around the edge but to no avail. Also the cookie like top cracked and chipped apart when overturned. Tastewise-OMG I wanted to just sit down and eat the batter--oh I also added a Tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon YUM! Well we will see what happens when I take the chilled layers out for assembly and decoration tomorrow. Wish me LUCK!",
