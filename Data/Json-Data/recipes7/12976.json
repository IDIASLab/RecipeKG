I used golden raisins and cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and that was plenty sweet for us (I think I could've used even a bit less sugar and it would've been fine).  I wasn't sure on using the raisins, but they tasted great in this salad.  I made this earlier in the day and I suggest doing that so the flavors can blend a few hours in the fridge. I will be making this again for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

For the dressing, I used Stevia\u00ae in place of the sugar, to cut the calories down, and my husband cannot tell the difference in taste.  I liked that this recipe used red wine vinegar.  We liked the tanginess that it added.  I mixed the dressing up in the morning and stirred it several times throughout the day.  I put the salad together about 45 minutes before dinner.  We loved it.  Served it with 'Slow Cooker Sausage with Sauce' from AR.  Kind of an odd combination, but I needed to use the broccoli up. Thanks readycooker, for sharing your recipe!",
