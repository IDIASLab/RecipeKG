As soon as I saw these I just knew I had to make them immediately. I cut the recipe down to use just 1 can of bicuits (that's all I had) and I used soaked wooden skewers instead of the brownie pop sticks. I guess my biscuits were the kind that puff up because you can't reallt see my cherry in the middle but it makes for a nice surprise inside.:) These were not only fun to make (me and Gabe had a blast) but they were DELICIOUS! Thanks SHORECOOK for another winning recipe that I will be making often!:)",

Update 7/31/14 - guess what we had for my birthday breakfast?! We used apples again and this time added chunks of fully cooked chicken smoked sausage - yum!
