This is simply a mislabelled recipe for Italian lemonade.\n\nIt needs quinine!\n\nTwo ways to go about it - instead of water and sugar pour quality tonic water, Schweppes, White Rock, Canada dry, or the more upscale Qtonic or Fever tree. Measure out the sugar proportionately based on tonic water sugar content.\n\nYou can also buy tonic concentrate and add sparkling water of your choice, in my case Perrier. You can also go with non-carbonated water if you prefer non-sparkling.",
