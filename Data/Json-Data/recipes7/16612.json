Popular in Apulia, these little cookies are made with chocolate, almonds, and lemon zest flavor and are eaten around Christmas and the winter holidays. Another special ingredient is vincotto, a traditional sweet paste made from unfermented grape must which is hard to find here, but you can use port wine. They are especially delicious with an espresso.",
