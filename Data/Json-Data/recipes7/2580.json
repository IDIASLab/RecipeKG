A ripe mango should have about the same consistency as a ripe peach. And a green mango feels about the same as a green peach. You can ripen green mangoes in a closed brown paper bag in 2-4 days. If you try to cook this dish with green mangoes you will not get any juice (or flavor) just as if you tried cooking a pie or some other dish with green peaches. Use only ripe mangoes to cook this dish. It's true the mace and pecans are not necessary for the main flavor of the dish. They are added for the pleasure of those whose palates enjoy more complex flavors and textures. It is perfectly fine to leave these out if you so wish.",

I did add a little bit of sliced red bell pepper and used red onion to give this a little color and make it more eye appealing. This was good but I think it would have been better had the chicken been marinated giving it more flavor. The mango topping was good and really is the star of this recipe because the chicken simply doesn t have much flavor. Made the mango topping early in the day warmed it up in the micro and grilled the chicken breasts. Good but I think it could be better.",
