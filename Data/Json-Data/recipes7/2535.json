After I got the milk and flour all combined I did knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it was smooth. After cutting out the doughnuts it helps a lot if you put the doughnuts on wax paper for the second rise placing top side down that way they do not stick to everything during the second rise. Mine only took 30 seconds on each side during frying. I did not use a deep fryer just a heavy 2qt sauce pan on the stove. Before you start frying line a cookie sheet with paper towel and place a cooling rack on top. Less mess that way. I could not get the indent to stay in my doughnut everytime I put it in the oil it disappeared so I did not do the whipped cream I just made a glaze. These are very tasty. I will make again. Thanks",

I let them rise for almost 1 1/2 hours but they still didn't rise at all. Anyway running out of daylight I decided to just stick them in my deep fryer and they turned out great. Made around 100 kneecaps. The more I/we (5 kids helping)stretched them out before putting them in the oil the better form they had when they came out. Which means the more cool whip they could put on top!!!! Yum we will make again. Tried the nutella per someone elses review...also great. Did some with sugar and just powdered sugar too.",
