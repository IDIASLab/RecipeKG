I almost forgot the water addition and after I did add it I wished I hadn't...there is no need for the water...you needed a strain it with a slotted spoon or you'd have a really soggy bun. If I make again I will omit the extra water completely, reduce the sugar a tad (although husband thought the sweetness was perfect) and certainly add some minced bell pepper or celery...I'm glad I had the extra onion.

Made exactly as written except I subbed a medium minced onion for the 2 tsp (which I assumed was dried). I'd call this Sloppy Joe's. I may have given it 4 stars though still loved it but husband and son had 2 helpings and lots of yumms so I changed to a 5. It was a bit sweet but not overly so. Served it with toasted whole wheat buns sweet potatoe fries and a green salad. It would be equally good over rice or with egg noodles. I will make it again and may eliminate the white sugar and add another TBSP of brown or may sub some tomatoe paste in for some of the ketchup. Thanks for the recipe!",
