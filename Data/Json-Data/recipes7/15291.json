I thought this may happen so wrapped the base up the sides of the pie dish but it was still a very messy dessert. Even wrapping the base up the sides I found the crust much too thick and very hard to cut through. The curd filling was tasty but a little overpowering - however my lemons were very juicy ( I wish they would give measurements of juice not quantities as lemons vary). I probably won t be making this recipe again but if I did 1: make the crust much thinner 2: use only 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice so it is not so overpowering and leaves a hint of coconut 3: add some coarse ground toasted coconut to the crust",
