ORIGINAL: My son loved this on his cheeseburger. He said \"wow mom you made sandwich spread!\" Not quite but good enough to get a repeat around here. My DH said he'd prefer this on hot dogs rather than his burger and has requested me to make it the next time we serve hot dogs. There were comments made that it was a little sweet. This made a lot so the next time I will make only half as much and I'd suggest that half of this will feed a family of five easily. I used sweet relish maybe dill relish would be a nice change and fix the \"good but kind of sweet\" comment I got on mine?",

I used regular dill pickle relish and also sweet relish both worked great but if you're looking for a less sweet flavor definitely use regular relish. Don't be discouraged about the egg in this it adds such a wonderful flavor. This is a great dip for thick fries too! Thanks for sharing I will continue to use this often!",
