I used marjoram, thyme, oregano, italian seasoning, sage, bay leaf, salt and pepper.

My changes weren't for any good reason i.e. I didn't think things needed to be changed per se. Anyway I used 12 tomatoes (1 or 2 were pretty small) I used 2 tablespoons grated carrot instead of sugar 2 cloves of garlic instead of powder I added 2 tablespoons Rose wine (it's what I had and I like to add wine) I used chopped fresh parsley and basil and this hot pepper flake called Red Neck Pepper - the Italian blend - to taste. I attempted to follow the recommendation of one person to use immersion blender after an hour or so and then reduce for 1-2 more hours to make thicker sauce but then I decided to make Pioneer Woman's Meatballs and that meant more time simmering anyway while I made those. I ended up having to add back in liquid to cover the meatballs and allow for 30 more minutes simmering time to cook the meatballs - 1 cup water 1 tsp Better than Bouillon. I prob used 1/2 of that liquid but again that was eye-balling it. So was this fantastic because of the meatballs? I don't know but I sure as heck will be using it again when I have fresh tomatoes.",
