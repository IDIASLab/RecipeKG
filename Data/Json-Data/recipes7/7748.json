Plus I have no idea why but the marshmallows I used would not melt. Maybe the marshmallows need to be \"homemade\" like the submitter suggested using. That may have given it a differen texture. I normally use recipes where I can make a mix ahead of time of making the cocoa. This one requires sitting over a stove and watching it. There is nothing wrong with it but it's just cocoa. It's not creamy or special. I made 3 servings using the calculate button. It all fit in a small pot and I am sure it will all dissapear with some whipped topping or some other fancy addition. One day should I come across homemade marshmallows I may try it again.",

I used normal sized marshmallows and they took like 15 minutes to melt. So I would say don t use giant marshmallows. The vanilla extract I would not add in again because it didn t really mix in well. It just sort of floated on the top. It didn t really add much of a taste difference.",
