I used one large apple and put it in the blender with the eggs. Turned out fluffy. Also used frozen corn and put some corn in the blender to cream it a bit. I only had 2/3 cup of sugar but added some agave syrup. A bit sweet for my taste. I will put in less sugar and perhaps a bit of agave (it is supposedly healthier).",

I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I always top my corn muffins with honey butter (mix equal portions of honey and softened unsalted butter together), so I didn't want them to be too sweet. The 1/2 cup was perfect.\n3. I did not put in the 2nd 1/2 cup of milk and these still came out incredibly moist.\nAnother change that I will try next time is to only use 1 egg. These muffins had a definite custardy consistency which I did enjoy, but I am curious to try them with 1 egg for a more cakey consistency next time.\nMade with these adjustments, they were delicious! I'm actually thinking about including them on our Thanskgiving menu.",
