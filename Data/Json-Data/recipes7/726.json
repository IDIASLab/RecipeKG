Choereg is a traditional, slightly sweet bread, especially made for Easter.  It is delicious for breakfast with a nice cup of coffee. It takes some level of skill, but anyone used to handling yeast should not have a problem.  You can find Mahleb at Middle Eastern grocery stores, especially around Easter. It will be with the spices.  Please do not omit it, as this is what gives it its distinctive flavour and aroma.",

My husband requested I make this as his grandmother is Armenian and many of his Aunts make it in smaller loaves than this recipe calls for to hold their boiled eggs in on the Easter table. As he requested it a bit late I did an online search and found this. My husband said it tasted just like he remembered. As the recipe says DO NOT omit the Mahleb! It may be hard to find but it does make the recipe perfect. Also using the same braiding technique mentioned on smaller sections of dough and connecting the ends to form a small circle produces a lovely \"egg cup.\" when you do this the same cooking time applies.",

I'm sure she won't be upset once she learns that it has received so many stars; ) WHERE TO PURCHASE MAHLEB: you can purchase it on-line by going to The Spice House. (Ani is registered with them.) TIPS by D McM from Toronto: Use mahleb in similar quantity to how you use nutmeg in any bread or pastry recipe. Mahleb does wonders when added to the dough of shortbread pound cake pie crusts and waffles.",

When I substituted evaporated milk for whole milk, it tasted identical to my grandmother's.\n\nMy grandmother would put M&M's, colored sugar, and gummy candies on top of the bread (likely for us!).  We loved the way that it smelled in the kitchen.  She made it at Christmas as well as Easter.  \n\nOh, how I miss her cooking--both the smell and taste of it!  These also make WONDERFUL dinner rolls that your guests will love.  So, don't relegate them to the holidays!\n\nThanks you for sharing this recipe.",

I had to add almost 3 cups of flour because the dough was not a dough but the consistency of thin oatmeal you would have for breakfast. It was about right then but of course it was a little heavy then. I have not tasted it yet but I bet it will taste ok but it will not be lite and/or fluffy.",
