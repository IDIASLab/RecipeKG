My recommendation is to make the cake according to the directions on the box without adding whiskey to the water. Then make the syrup by mixing 1/2 cup whiskey and 1/2 cup sugar stirring to dissolve sugar. Bring to a boil reduce heat to medium and cook 5 minutes. 1 or 2 Tablespoons butter can then be added stir until butter melts. Gently apply the syrup over the warm cake layers with a pastry brush until all the syrup is used or poke the cakes all over with a skewer and drizzle the syrup. To me a whole cup of butter in the frosting is excessive. 1/2 cup is plenty.",

I did have to adjust the icing adding about another 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and about 3T more irish cream ( i used carolan's) Because you could taste nothing but the butter. however it was probably one of the best icings ever very smooth wonder flavor excellent. The next time i make this cake I will double the stout beer carmel as it was only enough four one layer. but still a wonderful recipe thank you.",
