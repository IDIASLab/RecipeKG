Then I put the juices from the apples in a small pot, on medium to low heat, and slowly added heavy whipping cream until it was the consistency I wanted, about 1/2 cup. Bring to a boil for about 3 to 5 minutes then add about a 1/4 cup of caramel sauce to the apple mixture. Heat sauce until boiling. After the pie comes ot of the oven pour the sauce mixture on top of the crumble and let it cool. \nNext time I make this recipe I'm going to add carmel sauce to the apples before they go into the pie crust. \nOne more thing instead of the edges of the crust laying flat I made a lip so I could have more pie filling.",
