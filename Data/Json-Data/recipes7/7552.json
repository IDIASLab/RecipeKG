After 65 minutes of baking the centers seemed to be still liquidy so I turned off the oven and left them in for about another hour. I used a quart of home canned spiced peaches instead of commerical peaches. I always sprinkle Turbinado sugar on top of sweet baked goods and I did with this too. When baking after 35 minutes the tops seemed to be getting too brown so I covered with foil. Upon first taste it tasted like plain pound cake and it was very moist. We'll see how it is after it cools completely and sits for a day. Thanks!",

Making this again tomorrow for Thanksgiving but 1/2 the recipe will be plenty. A must make!",

I tried it once replacing the peaches with pears and it came out a bit lacking in flavor but moist and otherwise good. Second time I used a combination of peaches and apricots and the flavor was sublime. I don't have a loaf pan but I've experimented and found these were a bit dry as cupcakes but good as a 9x9. My favorite version was in my cast-iron skillet with fresh peaches a touch of grapeseed oil and a sprinkling brown sugar on the bottom. Peach upside-down cake! Phenomenal.",
