My own experience included forgetting to put the brown sugar in (the glory of baking with a 20 month old running rampant) and I have a feeling my baking powder is old.  I came out with a very dense muffin and it could have been sweeter.  I sprinkled brown sugar on top which both sweetened it a little and gave me a crumby coating and it worked good. Even with my two mishaps and without sprinkling the sugar on top these were pretty good. I'd save this recipe to reuse my cranberry sauce each year. I tried to stretch it to make 18 but gosh they were small.   I think 12 is the number. I'd add a crumb coating too next time. .Thanks for the recipe!\n\n*I went back to check and apparently I have two jars of baking powder.  One is fresh, the other expired in oct 2014 ??. So recipe works even with that going on.",

Thinking that half-and-half couldn\u2019t possibly make it worse, LOL. I have been searching for the last couple years for different recipes to use up my leftover homemade cranberry sauce. My cranberry sauce is pretty simple. It is 16 ounces of fresh cranberries, 2 cups of sugar,  half a cup of orange juice, half a cup of cranberry juice or water, and 1 tablespoon of orange zest. Bring it to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes. This is the sauce I used to make these muffins and I have to say this is probably the best use of my leftover cranberry sauce that I\u2019ve tried to date and it will go into my recipe folder because I will be making them again. I have tried a cranberry orange bread and cranberry orange scones, both of which are made with leftover cranberry sauce. Was not impressed with the bread and the scones were pretty good. But these muffins topped all three of these recipes. I will probably keep the recipe for the scones and this recipe for the muffins and that will be the two recipes I use to make use of my leftover cranberry sauce.  I noticed some reviews left out the spices and I can\u2019t imagine doing that because the spices were right on for these muffins. And the amount of sugar was just right. And as far as putting a topping on them, not needed. These muffins stand just as they are and need nothing else. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.",
