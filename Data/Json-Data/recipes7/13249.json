This is a copycat of their dressing using mostly ingredients from the cabinet most people keep on hand or can find easily.  The water makes it stretch a little further for those on a tight budget, but you might also like it without.",

This substitutions definitely raised the cost of the recipe, but really elevated the taste as well, I believe. Overall, good recipe that yields a LOT of dressing, even without the water, which I reduced to 1/2 c. The roasted red pepper takes more time to prepare but enhances the recipe. I used the dressing in a pasta salad that I brought to an event and received numerous compliments!",
