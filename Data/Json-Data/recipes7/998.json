My batter was also sticky but no fear, the cake also came out wonderfully moist. To spread the batter evenly in the bottom of pan, I just dipped the back of my spoon in a little flour each time I spread it. For the 2nd layer of batter on top of the peaches, I just plopped dollups of batter all over; it spread together very nicely. I used fresh peaches which were very juicy. I was worried it would be messy (too wet) but the cake batter cooked everything evenly together. I didn't modify any of the ingredients and comments I received from coworkers were 1) wasn't sweet at all, perfect flavor; 2) very moist; 3) very delicious. Definitely a KEEPER! One of which I'll be making again SOON!",

So taking the lead from mominml I put all the batter in the pan then topped it with the peaches and streusel. It did work well and it was so much easier than spreading the two layers of batter. The butter and sour cream contributed great flavor and made the cake deliciously moist so moist I fear that if there were leftovers the next day they d be soggy. Not wanting to take any chances I froze individual pieces of the remaining cake. I appreciated the buttery rich flavor of the cake against the fresh pure flavor of the peaches with no other spices or distracting add-ins. I made the recipe with no changes other than my concern about it getting soggy if it hung around for more than a day it was perfect just as is.",

I was saving half of my leftover peaches to make muffins, but everyone loved this cake so much that I ended up using them for another pan.  This is so moist and delicious.  A few changes based on what I had: didn't use pecans in the topping, used brown sugar in the topping because that is my preference.  I also didn't layer the batter.  I spread the batter in the bottom of the pan, placed the peaches on top and then sprinkled with the streusel.  This worked really well for me.  I think that this recipe would work well with other fruits and berries as well and will definitely be trying this again.  Thanks!",

I've tried it with frozen and fresh peaches and I much prefer fresh though frozen was good too. I didn't have pecans so I omit them and I double the streusel. Most recently I used raspberries instead of peaches and sprinkled a little sugar on them when I put them in the batter. This was very good as well. Thanx for a great recipe!",

I did double the topping (left out the pecans) and I am glad I did. This cake rises to the top of the 9 x 13 pan and it needs the additional topping. I also added a 1/4 cup brown sugar to the topping ingredients and think it made a wonderful addition. Will make this again!",
