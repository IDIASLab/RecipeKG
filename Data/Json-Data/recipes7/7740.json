Around the roast in the crock pot I put pearl onions, carrot chunks, and halved garlic cloves.  I used a smaller, petite roast as it is just my husband and I, so I cut the cook time down.  When done, I took the cooking liquid and put it in a pot on the stove and thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.  The veggies were soooo delish, I highly recommend adding them!  I did find the sauce to be a touch salty, so perhaps using reduced sodium soy sauce would be better.",

It really change the taste of the broth but it was still very good , it had more of a stew or pot roast flavour.
