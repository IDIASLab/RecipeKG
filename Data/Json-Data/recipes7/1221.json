I submitted this particular recipe and to Beth who made a comment you are correct if you are going by the picture. I don't know where this picture came from but its NOT my pudding! The picture looks like a cake. I wrote a long time ago to the webmaster to delete the photo because it is misleading. My grandmother's father whose last name was Mitchell was born and raised in Mitchell Indiana. This recipe came from his family. I hope to get my own pudding photo uploaded to replace the one there now. Thanks:) -Kerry",
