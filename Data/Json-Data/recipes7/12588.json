By modern standards, this cake is ridiculously rich. In fact, some of you may find it too intense, but most true chocolate fiends will be in heaven. Serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.",

I cheated a little in preparing this because I do not have a double boiler (it is on my list of things to procure). I used a regular sauce pan and put the stove on its lowest setting to melt the choc/ butter sauce Hershey's special dark chocolate bars, they seemed to work just fine as opposed to the cacao chocolate bars, I suspect would be expensive. I wouldn't serve this without the raspberry sauce, as the cake is extremely rich and requires the sauce to cut the sweetness.  I tasted it without the sauce and almost wanted to ask for insulin to prevent high glucose coma...lol.  Overall, this is sweet, easy to prepare, has very few ingredients and is impressive by any cooks standards.  I can't believe I have paid up to $10.00 in restaurants for a desert I could have made myself.  Chef John, you've outdone yourself once again!!!",

Using an electric mixer on high settings it took about 8 minutes to bring the egg mixture to a pale and very thick state. Whisking this mixture would seemingly take quite a bit longer and be a workout. Perhaps not a guilt free indulgence but well worth every pleasurable bite. Made the \"Fresh Raspberry Sauce\" to compliment this dessert and had vanilla frozen yogurt for anyone wanting to add a scoop. Thank you Chef John.",
