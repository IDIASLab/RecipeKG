I probably used less orange juice as I was leery of the citrus flavor but then added a splash of skim milk to get the right texture. I also skipped the ice as most of my fruit was frozen so I didn't think I needed it and sweetened to taste with agave nectar. I had frozen fresh cherries specifically to try in a smoothie and this recipe is a perfect example of how to use them that way! Thanks for sharing!",

The ice is needed since there's very little liquid. As to the person with the old blender - not sure it's the blender - there just isn't a lot of liquid to mix the fruit smooth. I managed and the ice was pure liquid by time I was done but it's definitely easy getting it smooth with more liquid.",
