This dessert is so fast and easy and looks cooked because we brulee sugar on top of the mascarpone. I'm not a big dessert person but this is my idea of the perfect finish to that early summer dinner.",

I made the shortcakes from \"Buttermilk Strawberry Shortcake\" (also from this site), and used frozen strawberries and blueberries (as that's what I had on hand). It turned out delicious! I can only imagine how good it would be using fresh berries! The mascarpone/brulee really puts this over the top. Would make this again in a heartbeat!",

I also don't own a little torch so I put it under the broiler for a few seconds. However that didn't harden the sugar because the cheese started melting before the sugar crystallized. No matter. It tasted amazing anyway. Will make this again. I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so nice.",
