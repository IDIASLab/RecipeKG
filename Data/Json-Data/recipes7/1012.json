No worse for wear by baking longer--just made the squash, apples, and onions more tender.\n\n(5) Instead of white flour, I used 1/4 c wheat germ on a whim, and then added a dusting of whole wheat flour.  This absorbed the the liquid, creating a thick binding \"sauce\", and added an extra element of mouthfeel.\n\n(6) I didn't bother \"layering\" but instead tossed all the ingredients together, which I liked because the cheese was distributed throughout.  I used 50% fat reduced Colby cheddar cheese.  Tossing the shredded cheese throughout helped hide the fact that as usual, it didn't melt terribly well.  The cheese combined with the broth to help create a sauce.\n\nInstead of sprinkling the bacon only on the top, I also tossed crisped turkey bacon through the casserole towards the end of the baking time.\n\n(7) To save on calories, I didn't grease the Anchor Hocking glass casserole dish I used.  There was absolutely no need because nothing stuck.",

We are a meat and potatoes family and don't usually venture from the very typical brocolli green beans peas carrots types of veggies. I was unsure of this recipe but had a squash I needed to use. This recipe sounded the most appealing to me. My daughter had 3 helpings! My son ate 1 and everyone liked it though it was pretty unanimous that more cheese would have been better. The sweet flavor with the sharp cheddar was a great contrast. Personally I could have done without the cinnamon too because it made the apple taste like apple pie and that threw me off. We chopped everything into 1/2\" cubes tossed it in the flour mixture added the cheese and bacon to the bag and tossed that too then added it all to the dish poured 1/2 c broth over it and sprinkled a few red pepper flakes on it. I baked it for about an hour. So next time personally I'd take the cinnamon out and maybe add a bit of cayenne or something to spice it up a tiny bit. The red pepper flakes were good but too hot for my kids.",
