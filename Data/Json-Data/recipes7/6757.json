And I liked!  I really wanted to try the cake prior to adding the milk mixture but I really needed that experience of knowing what it was suppose to taste like. I made extactly to a T minus the part of using a 10x15. I used a 8x10 and it was very fluffy high, I did a toothpick check at 4 minutes prior to removing and then when I pulled the cake out at the beep of the timer, it wasn't high like it was. Wasn't sure if I had done anything wrong. I then mixed up the milk, tasted the milk and was like...hmm I don't like the taste of evap in this and already started being disappointed over the flavor before it was totally finished BUT having said that, I followed through with letting it set in the frig and couldn't wait to pull out and try. And glad I did. It was really nice, no over whelming flavor of evap. And the cake was moist without being super runny with liquid and didn't crumble with it being somewhat wet. I was very reserved with my thought until my family tried it and they thought it was fabulous and my son has requested that I make this for his birthday. The addition of whipped topping, toasted coconut and a strawberry sliced over the portion of cake, was an excellent addition..It's a must try recipe.",

For the cook who said they baked this in a 9X13 pan: this was a big mistake; of course it would run out of the pan and into the oven! Any baker knows you never use a smaller pan unless you half the recipe.Use the 10X15 pan (which is quite a common size for people who do any regular baking---most sheet cakes are in this size pan) and your cake will turn out perfect! Follow the recipe next time and you will have a remarkable and wonderful cake!",

I know there were other recipes of this \"three milk cake\" and glad to pick this as well. I did few things differently: I whipped the egg whites and the other ingredients separately and at the end added the yolk flour mixture into stiff egg white mixture (half the sugar amount was dissolved in the egg whites and the other half was in the yolk mixture). I also cut the sugar by half since I know sweetened condensed milk would be very sweet. (My family likes not-too-sweet desserts.) Also instead of using heavy cream for the three milk mixture I used light cream (5%) and to us it still tastes awesome with less calories. Lastly I left the cake sit with milk mixture overnight so that it gives more time for the cake to absorb the milk mixture. Served with blueberries instead of strawberries and PERFECT! Next time I will try with coconut milk like others have suggested. I will definitely make these again and again!",

Once the caked was cooled down, iI poured the milk mixture. It absorbed all the milk and it was spongy-licious. After refrigerated for a couple hours, the flavored was great.
