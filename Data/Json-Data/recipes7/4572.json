They seem like candy to me---judging by the amount of sugar. My finished product came out looking very attractive. I cut the bars into small squares and tried one. The first bite made every tooth in my head ache. Also I'm not sure that 1/4 cup of blackberries is enough as I really couldn't taste them in the filling. I also found that 5 squares of chocolate was sufficient to make the glaze. I do think it is great that folks in the Nanaimo area have a \"treat\" that they are known for and that they enjoy. I would encourage them to try this recipe and post their comments. Just because it was too sweet for my taste doesn't mean that others wouldn't enjoy this.",
