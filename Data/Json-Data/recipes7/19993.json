I made it as is per the recipe this time, but to cut some of the sweetness I will just chop up more strawberries instead of letting them soak in sugar. And I also used a cream cheese icing to also help cut some of the sweet cake. The cake was also like a shortbread texture, it wasn\u2019t fluffy but it wasn\u2019t dense either!!!",
