The recipe makes just enough frosting to top 12 cupcakes; if your egg whites are small or you like a lot of frosting you might want to double the batch or use three egg whites.",

Also make sure that your pan and utensils are grease free. A plain round #12 tip will let you pipe high marshmallow like peaks.

That was the easy part. Then I got to the frosting and it was a bit of a disaster. I assume I did not beat it long enough even though I set my kitchen timer to ensure I went the whole 7 minutes. It looked to me as though peaks were forming but apparently they weren't stiff enough as the result was a VERY runny frosting! So I set to work trying to thicken it by adding powdered sugar. I stuck it in the fridge for awhile and it set up somewhat...still I ended up with more of a glaze than a frosting. Since the glaze/frosting was sticky I went ahead and put some mini marshmallows on top and put them under the broiler as directed. They taste amazing! I am sure the frosting error was mine and I will try again making sure stiff peaks form before I proceed. Also next time I think I will up the spices just a notch because I love the spicy flavors of Fall so much! Thanks for a fun and scrumptious recipe Doughgirl8:)",
