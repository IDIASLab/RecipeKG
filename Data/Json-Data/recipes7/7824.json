So obviously i didn't make the filling and can't say how that turned out. I did add the orange zest to the cranberry sauce and the orange flavor is just right. I did a double batch and did one as the wreaths and the other rolled up like cinnamon rolls. Both worked well. I only had half the amount of evaporated milk but used whole for the rest and it was fine. Next time I will try using orange juice instead of Vanilla in the frosting for an orange flavor. Don't be afraid of the flour on the counter top. You don't want a thick layer but if there isn't enough flour it's not going to be very easy to fold or roll the dough. The recipe says it makes a \"thick batter\". They mean \"soft dough\" so if using a mixer use the bread hooks at least once you start to add the final flour.",

I brought these in to work and they were gone in under 10 minutes! I made the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I might change next time is to use a bit less orange peel. Make sure you chop the cranberries really fine. It'll make it easier to spread the filling. For the icing I used vanilla-nut extract. Nice combo of flavors!",

                "reviewBody": "This was an adventure! First- I was out of AP flour but since I have been dabbling in gluten free baking I had some rice flour on hand. I subbed that for the AP flour and it resulted in a lovely dough but one that did not rise and also there was no way I was folding it without it cracking. Second- in a strange twist I had no oranges (when I almost always have them) but I did have Cointreau (when I almost never have liquor)...so I subbed that in for the orange. Those were my only ingredient changes. After a rather comical couple of minutes trying to chop the rollie-pollie cranberries I put them in my blender to chop them. I was careful to pulse until finely chopped but not completely mashed. Now I was at a loss as to what to do with my dough. Ultimately I rolled it into balls flattened the balls into rounds then spread some cranberry filling on half the rounds and topped with the remaining rounds. I crimped them together brushed with an egg wash and baked them. Then I topped them with the frosting which I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to in addition to the vanilla. These turned out incredibly amazingly good- kind of like a super fancy Pop-Tart! I have every intention of making these again the proper way but I am so happy I was able to turn what could have been a failure into a delectable success. I do believe when I make this again I will still sub the Cointreau for the orange- it gives such a lovely depth of flavor. Overall a must try!!!",

If the milk mixture is too hot you'll waste time and ingredients. (Like I did.) Do use the bread hooks. Cranberries are not available where I'm based so I used a one cup jar of cranberry sauce and added one teaspoon of orange zest and 1/4 cup of sugar. To answer Kate's question.... yes you fold it like a brochure so there is one layer on the bottom and two layers that overlap on top. They turn out just fine!
