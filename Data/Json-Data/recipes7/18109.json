                "reviewBody": "Turned out pretty good but there was a few issues with the recipe. First at 375 degrees my cobbler started to burn after 30 minutes. Temperature needs to be reduced to 350 degrees and baked for 30-35 minutes. Second even though the topping was tasty it was cake-like and way too thick. Half of the amount would be more than enough. Third I used 3 medium sized mangoes and there was still more topping than fruit. I think 4 mangoes would be perfect. And last I do not have peach schnapps or any fruit flavored liqueur so I omitted it and used the juice of all 3 mangoes and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I would say this is a cake with fresh mango instead of a cobbler.",
