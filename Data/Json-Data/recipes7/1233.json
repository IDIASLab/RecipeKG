I also added a few extra veggies, cleaning out the fridge of all the little extra bits and pieces.\n\nThis is definitely a keeper!",

The soup was very satisfying.  Hey, it's cheap, easy, goes a long way, and tastes good.  What more could you ask for?\n\nUpdate 7/08:  Made this using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar (that's what I had), and the soup was way too sweet with a weird flavor.  I highly recommend sticking with white vinegar and sparingly using an unrefined sugar.",

I see from the reviews, some people chose to brown anyway. A little too late in preparation for me to change, I just carried on. At first taste I found my error to have no negative effect because the resulting soup was delicious. I tend to prefer savory/salty rather than sweet so I took advice from a few reviewers and upped the vinegar and trimmed the sugar. It was interesting to taste the the effect the added vinegar made. I now understand what many reviewers mean by the tang. A whole head of cabbage was a little much. I will cut this amount if I have another go. I added a small amount of fresh spinach in the last 10 minutes. Might as well get some extra nutrients the easy way.  This soup is a great example of how a few personalized changes do not deter a simple, solid recipe. Thanks for posting.",
