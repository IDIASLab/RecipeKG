I used about 3 tbsps. to season a batch of vegetarian chili as I always add cocoa to my chili anyway so it made sense and worked great! Later I used some as a rub for boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts. I browned those and made a chicken sweet potato tomato and black bean stew. Oh I did also use the rub on slices of tofu but it basically just tasted like dry rub on tofu - won't be repeating that one. Much better suited for meats stews chilis and maybe even some fish.

It's a great deep and garlicy flavor with just enough sweetness to taste but not over-power. I did use only about 3T. of salt but I don't think using the full 1/4c. would be bad....especially on a cut of meat without the thick layer of fat that the brisket had. Loved it!!

It made enough to thoroughly - perhaps too thoroughly - coat about 14 legs. Probably a little intense for many but everyone I served it to raved. UPDATE: This time I made it with half the salt and no onion powder (on hand y'know?)and took it to a pot luck. I watched carefully - only adults took it but they all finished it.
