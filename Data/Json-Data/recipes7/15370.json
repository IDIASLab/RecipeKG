The only thing that I did differently was to fold my blueberries into the batter rather than placing them on the top of the pancakes once they\u2019re on the griddle.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand), and it brought just a little tang to the pancakes and the blueberries give you a  juicy burst of sweetness.  Tender, moist, and simply good!",
