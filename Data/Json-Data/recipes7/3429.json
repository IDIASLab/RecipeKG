This trifle is the special recipe from my grandmother and has been perfected over the years by other family members as well.  It is a must have dessert during the holiday season.  Make a huge batch, serve and if you don't eat it all, stick it in the fridge and it tastes even better the second day!",

After the milk is hot (not to boiling) I add (4) beaten egg yolks and a mix (in separate bowl) of 1/4 sugar, pinch of salt and 2-3 Tblsps corn startch. I slowly add the dry mix after adding the yolks into the hot milk and simmer until thick, stirring frequently. Then I add (1) Tsp. vanilla extract and (1) Tblsp. butter. This custard works great for coconut cream pie (wherein I add (1) cup toasted coconut after the custard thickens) and also for filling cream puffs. After it has cooled a bit, I pour it into a shallow bowl and cover w/plastic wrap, being sure to fit the wrap tightly around the top of the custard, thus avoiding watery custard when refrigerated. And using whole milk is the key, not low-fat milk.",
