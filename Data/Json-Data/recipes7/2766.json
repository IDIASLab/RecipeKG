        "description": "If you've ever prayed for an apple pie recipe with a substantial, luscious, juicy apple filling, but without a flood of juice when you cut it, then this tall, majestic creation is for you. Potato starch keeps the filling inside the pie where it belongs, but without the chalky, pasty texture often caused by using flour. The juices here are thick and clear, without that thick, sticky 'supermarket' feel. They coat the apple slices lightly and beautifully with no soupiness.",

My youngest son loves apple pie and requested one so I browsed around here and found this. We like 2 crust fruit pies versus lattice topped. The only challenge was a 10\" pie crust recipe. I was in a huge rush and didn't have time to search for one. I ended up using the store bought ready made (sorry to all the purists..LOL!) It was probably a little thin but I had to make do. It actually was quite tasty. I sliced the apples really thin as I don't care for undercooked apples in pie and they melted in your mouth. My MIL usually does T-giving and makes apple pie...burns the edges of the crust...yuck..and the apples are kinda hard so I was happy to give it a go! (No I don't hate my MIL I actually love her!) Thanks for the recipe...how 'bout a 10\" pie crust recipe????",
