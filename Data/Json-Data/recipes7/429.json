I halved, seeded, and placed my squash half side down in a pan with nonstick spray, and baked on 375 for about 40-45 minutes. This is so much easier than peeling and cutting it raw. The consistancy will be mushier and moist, so when its in the pan it will not brown. I also slow cooked this recipe because I fell in love with the smell! When it came to adding the broth, I HIGHLY recommend that you slowly add this ingredient because depending on the size of your squash, this much broth may be the reason some of your soups came out watery. I would add it until its like a chunky applesauce. Then, while blending, add some cream and pulse your blender until it resembles traditional applesauce. I then put the soup back into the pan on a low simmer and chopped up apples, paper thin, and added them. I simmered this, allowing the apples to soften and absorb the flavor. If you are going to add apples, I advise you to add them after you puree, the apple pieces really finish off this dish. Again, fantastic!",

I dropped a star not because of the soup itself but simply because the descriptions of the steps in the recipe seemed to me misleading and thus confusing. What I mean is that descriptions of what the vegetables should look like at different steps in the process i.e. \"golden brown \" \"spotty caramel color \" never happened when I made it no matter how long I let it cook at that stage. So after waiting long enough for these color changes I would simply move on and the soup still turned out great.",

It was our first course at our Thanksgiving meal and it got absolute raves from everyone (including my 5 year old!) I mostly followed the recipe except I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1 1/2tsp (although the full amount probably would have been fine, I worried that it was too much). I was very lucky that I had all the veggies from our local organic CSA and I used my own chicken stock. I also added leeks because I had them, as well as a sprig of fresh thyme. I used a quart of chicken stock and about 2 lbs of butternut squash. It made a good consistency soup that needed almost no half and half at all (I probably used about 1/2 cup). The cayenne gave this a wonderful kick. I garnished with fresh thyme instead of apple chips. My family said that it was \"restaurant quality\" soup. It is a great recipe that I am sure will become a T-day tradition in our house.",

I think I am going to heat up the leftovers and add some brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit. Was a lot of fun to make though very easy directions to follow and the kitchen smelled like a perfect autumn fragrance.",
