I wasn't EVEN prepared for that!   Do you know how many different kinds of chocolate chip cookies I've made over the years?  Not to mention my standby favorite?  Subsequent \"m'mmms\" and \"yummy\" reinforced that review.  Now in all fairness, when I first told him I was considering making chocolate chip cookies with whiskey in them, he was all over that!  Oh yeah, whiskey in cookies!  When I tasted them I  thought ok, you're going to be disappointed because you can't even taste any whiskey in them  (Hubs insists you do, \"a little bit\").  He and I tend to differ in what we consider a good chocolate chip cookie (I like mine sort of dry and crunchy) so we'll use his 5-star review:  He says he doesn't know why, it's difficult to describe - his brain and his taste buds just tell him these are the best.  The whiskey, he said four cookies later, somehow balances out the sweetness and makes them interesting.   I'm happy  to be the first to review these Nashville Nosher, and Hubs thanks you for the best chocolate chip cookie he ever ate.",

I made the recipe (with the changes above )this weekend and was really impressed! When mixed the batter is extremely wet for cookie dough. I did NOT add any additional flour and just dropped globs of the dough onto the cookie sheet. I was thinking that these would bake and run all over the tray but they ended up forming nicely and actually had a lot more 'body' than any other chocolate chip cookie recipe I've made so far! The whiskey adds so much depth and flavor to the recipe and the salt just finishes it off nicely. This is by far a favorite of mine and the extra whiskey is worth it!! Great recipe!!",
