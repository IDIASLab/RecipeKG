All the other recipes I found require a bread maker, which I don't have, so I was very happy to find such a easy recipe that doesn't require a bread maker. Definitely going to start using this bread instead of buying store made bread.",

I will probably let it rise longer so it isn't quite as dense but the taste is great and my husband actually wants to use this bread to make his sandwiches. I figured out the cost to be around 1.50 for one loaf. I will probably grease the top (brush with oil) before it goes in the oven next time so its not so clumpy on top. Thank you for this recipe! I can save a lot of money by baking it myself.",
