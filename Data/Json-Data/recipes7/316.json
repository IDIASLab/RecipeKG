Usually I like to drown my pancakes in my homemade apple syrup, but these were awesome with a minimal amount of syrup.  \r\nI made these last week, substituting milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk.  It did not work, not sure if that was because of my error or whatever.  In any case, I made it as stated today and they were perfect.  I also scaled the recipe down to 9.6 servings to get equal eggs, etc.  \r\nI really can't say enough about these, this recipe will be my pancake recipe from now on.  You can also scale to 7.2 (3 eggs, 3 flour, 3 buttermilk, etc.); 4.8 (2 eggs, 2 flour, 2 buttermilk); 2.4 (1 egg, 1 flour, 1 buttermilk). \r\nThank you for contributing!

The pancakes come out so light and fluffy and utterly delicious!!!  I've made this 4 times now for friends and family and everyone raves about them and asks for the recipe.  Also, the last couple of times I made them I added 2 tbsp each of milled flax seed and wheat germ; it doesn't change the taste at all and it adds a little healthy twist to it!",

The other reviewer who said that they don't need much syrup, it's true!  I was eating most from the griddle, plain.\n\nI made the recipe as specified, but added a splash of vanilla.  [I also like to try to eat healthy, so I substituted whole wheat flour, which I couldn't even taste because the flavor of this pancake is so awesome, and nonfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk.]\n\nI cannot recommend this recipe enough!  They do come out soooooo light and fluffy and taste like they're straight from the griddle of your fave breakfast restaurant.\n\n[Also, note to those who found their pancakes to be tough and chewy: That's usually a sign that the pancake batter was mixed too long or strongly... try gently mixing in the dry ingredients into the wet slowly and gently until moistened, and see if that makes a difference!]",

He called them \"flapjacks\", and described them as a thinner, firmer and more flavorful version of traditional pancakes.  I have repeatedly tried and failed to duplicate them for him, UNTIL NOW!!  These are it!!  I made them a few weeks ago for the first time, and he was ecstatic!!  He has requested them every weekend since!!  Since the first time I made them, the only thing I have changed is to add a little vanilla, (makes them a beautiful golden color), but everything else is exactly the same. My search for the perfect \"flapjack\" is over!!! (After 11 years!!)  Thank you soooo much for this fabulous recipe!!",

I added flour to make it less runny as the recipe noted and they plumped up a bit but turned completely tasteless. Syrup could not save them. Now I have a dozen tasteless disks in my freezer. Bummer!
