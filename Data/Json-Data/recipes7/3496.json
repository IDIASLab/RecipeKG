I'm so glad I did! I think this recipe is terrific! I love the dill and the taragon both of which become very subtle after simmering. I made few changes to the recipe. I peeled and seeded our torpedo-sized zucchini. I didn't use roma tomatoes just some that my husband had recently harvested. I used only 1/2 a cup of water. Next time I might reduce the sugar a bit but that's the only change that I think I'd make. And the good news is that there's plenty of leftovers so I'll freeze half for a cold fall evening. We had the soup with some crunchy bread and had what I thought was a perfect meal. My three-year-ld thought so too.",

I put the chicken broth in the slow cooker on high while I started to prepare the remaining ingredients. I dissolved sugar in a small cup of the hot broth and lemon juice and then added back to the slow cooker. I used a pint of my own canned tomatoes which I put a tablespoon of lemon juice in that when I can. I used 3 teaspons of dried dill weed and 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried tarragon and 1 tablespoon of onion powder and used 1 tablespoon of freeze dried garlic. Cooked on high in slow cooker and was ready in 3 hours I have 4 stars because the parmesan to me added a grittiness I didn't like and also think it's better to peel tomatoes when used in any recipe. (quickest easiest way is to put in boiling water no more than 1 minute and immediatly put in ice bath and skins should come right off) Will make agein with either all fresh ingredients or with my modified slow cooker recipe....",
