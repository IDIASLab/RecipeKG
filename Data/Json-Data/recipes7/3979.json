Instead of boiling the zucchini which I think would kill the flavor I sauteed it on medium-high while the quinoa was cooking and then I turned it up to high for the last few minutes to brown it. I used Greek yogurt for the sauce so it was nice and tangy; it mixed perfectly with the caramelized zucchini. I thought a cup of dill might be a bit strong but it was just right. A definite keeper--and so easy!",

I confess I didn't have fresh dill so used 1/2 amount of dried dillweed and it was outstanding. I found that in a skillet the small amount of rice with water doesn't really boil so the zucchini really did saute in the olive oil and I had to cover the pan in order for the rice to get tender. Ingredients already in kitchen minimal prep time fabulous blend of flavors....I put it in my \"Family Loved It\" file!",

I cooked as instructed for almost 20min. but my rice was still hard so I added a bit more water turned the heat back up then covered and simmered for 10 more minutes. My zucchini still weren't over cooked and it turned out perfectly. Next time I'll just add some extra water and cover the dish half way through the 20 minutes. I served this with a Tzatziki sauce (this sauce plus some lemon juice olive oil garlic and pepper) and the Shish Tawook Chicken recipe from allrecipes - all shoved into pita pockets.
