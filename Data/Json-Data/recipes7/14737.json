I made it on the side of Thai Peanut Beef (from another site - www.damndelicious.net) and it was a perfect companion. Plan at least for half a cucumber per person, if not more - that seems to only work out to 3-4 'spaghetti' bites! Oh, and you can save the cucumber juice for a cucumber gimlet or martini with a little extra sugar.",
