I used white chocolate instead if candy dip and refrigerated them to solidify it and it was amazing. I definitely recommend adding the orange extract as the flavor combined with the white chocolate and coconut was fabulous. One caution though is that the cookies are very fragile when still warm after cooking. I lost a couple to the dipping process when they crumbled into the white chocolate. I then had to use a spoon to get the crumbs out. Once they were dipped and chilled they held together quite well and survived a 2 hour drive over a curvy road perfectly.",

I made 1/2 recipe and got exactly 18 cookies using a cookie scoop. I did add the optional extracts. Be careful as a little goes a long way! I also tried white jimmies and coconut. The coconut gave it a slight tropical taste and the white chocolate made it taste just as expected like a white chocolate and orange cookie. I used real white chocolate and melted 1 cup for 1/2 the recipe. I only ended up using about half of it though and it was plenty. I had to bake mine for 18 minutes.",
