My pie turned out excellent, with the perfect consistency and combination of tart and sweet.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 3 tablespoons of quick tapioca to the filling.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't runny as well as keep a lot of the tartness from the rhubarb.  I don't like to add a lot of sugar to fruit pies because of the natural sweetness of the fruit.

Luckily I had a pan underneath and caught all spillage. Once cool it had a wonderful consistency.

                "reviewBody": "I love rhubarb season!  As soon as those stalks are long  and thick enough,  I'm baking me some strawberry rhubarb pie! I do have a favorite recipe I've used for nearly 40 years, but I always like to try something new.  This is a fine recipe, but my old favorite still prevails. Never added vanilla to a fruit pie, and I found  it unnecessary. As for the cinnamon,  3/4 tsp. was overkill to me.  I want the fresh taste  of rhubarb and strawberries, not a dominating taste  of cinnamon.  A quarter tsp. was better for me, but I still found  that with this strawberry/rhubarb combination I  prefer  the 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg I typically use.  More important than these small issues,  you need to know this is a juicy pie. And even after sitting overnight, which tends to thicken it up, this was still a juicy pie. But I'm from the camp who believes that juicy is just what a good old-fashioned fruit pie SHOULD be. No gelatinous, intact wad of pie for me!  You might prefer otherwise, but for me this was just the right balance between tart and sweet. As for the crust, I  chose to use a pie crust I've used successfully for many years, \"Basic Flaky Pie Crust,\" also from this site. Note:  After many years of hauling rhubarb annually in my suitcase to Naples so as the folks we know here  can enjoy it too (as I've done on this occasion as well), I can say with great confidence that these Floridians  like their rhubarb (unusual  for the locals and sadly missed by the former Northerners)  too!",

If you do not have cornstarch and look up online that 1 tablespoon cornstarch = 2 tablespoons flour like I did then it will come out a little deflated looking but the taste of it was still amazing!\n2. I cut the rhubarb into smaller pieces than what was recommended because I was worried big chunks of rhubarb would be too much rhubarb at one time but I regret this decision. The rhubarb sucks up all the flavors of the pie and gives the pie a little more sustenance in each bite.\n3.Homemade pie crust is worth the trouble of making!!! I bought a store bought pie crust and it came out a little undercooked when I used the cooking instructions from this recipe.\n4. This is truly a beginner mistake but DONT CUT INTO THE PIE BEFORE IT SITS OUT FOR THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME! It will look like liquid mush and will ruin the prettiness of your pie.\n\nHERE ARE A COUPLE GOOD TIPS I USED FROM OTHER REVIEWS:\n\n1. I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1 and 1/4 cups sugar\n2. I drained a little bit of the liquid from the filling mixture",

I did have a problem with my top crust & resorted to making a crumble instead. But otherwise did everything exactly. Also made one for my daughter & she loved it. Well definitely be making this pie for now on.",
