You can also use fresh nectarines or apricots in place of the peaches. It will look like you spent hours making this fancy 30 minute dessert! Pairs great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",

However, this recipe should have been a bit more precise on its ingredients & how much you should really put in. I probably put in too many strawberries, because the juice from the strawberries actually LEAKED through my galette & punched out too holes. I'm sure the flour would have done the trick to soak up some juice, so make sure you have a good ratio of fruits & flour/sugar.  Also, I added a little touch to the galette ends after looking at some other galette recipes. After folding the ends over, I brushed some egg all around the ends so that it could give that it could catch the sugar nicely & have that nice, golden brown, crunchy crust.  I suggest others to try out different things as well. This recipe is so versatile! Before adding the fruit toppings, I spread a thin coat of nutella (for a little surprise!) & on the other galette, some blackberry preserves (i wish i had orange marmalade...) Many original galette recipes call for this almond pastry called, frangipane of which you blend a mixture of almonds, sugar, & butter to create an almond paste. This almond paste makes a VERY scrumptious spread underneath the fruit filling. I'm definitely going to try that next time :)",

Since my peaches were very ripe and juicy I added a little extra flour for more thickening power. I took another reviewer's advice and brushed the crust with egg yolk before sprinkling on the turbinado sugar. Not only did this help the sugar stick it made a nice golden crust. This was a wonderful dessert with a real \"Wow\" factor and our guest said it looked like something that would be served in a restaurant. I'm happy to have discovered a recipe for something that's so easy to make but impressive at the same time.",
