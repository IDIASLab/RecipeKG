After reading the reviews I used a loaf pan but also filled 5 muffin cups...bread still got pretty high but did not overflow:) I baked at 375 in my convection oven the muffins took about 20 minutes the loaf was spot on at an hour but did darken considerably. I accidentally doubled the allspice but otherwise made no changes. Next time I'll do 6 muffins and tent the loaf with foil. Thanks Mott's!",

I added a half a cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon a teaspoon of salt and used the yolks. The result was good tasting banana bread but the texture was a little spongey. I also added a few chocolate chips on the top before baking because I'm not allowed to make banana bread without chocolate chips.",

I'm not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe to a T. After about an hour of baking the top was dark brown but still raw in the very middle. I popped it back in there to finish which made it darker and the outside rubbery (we peeled it off and ate the middle.) It definitely needs more spice and adding in some walnuts wouldn't hurt. I originally rated it at a 2 but after letting it sit my sons and husband really enjoyed it. I like substituting oil for applesauce - I would just alter some of the other parts of this recipe next time.",
