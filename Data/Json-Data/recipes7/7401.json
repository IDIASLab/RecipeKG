I don't generally like teeny cookies but these are SERIOUSLY adorable.  The dough is easy to work with and the cookies come out of the oven perfectly round with those cute little cracks we love in gingersnaps.  I prepared the recipe as is, save for adding a quarter teaspoon of salt to heighten flavor, and I'm not even so sure that made a noticeable difference. I also used the more traditional method of creaming the sugar and shortening, adding the egg and molasses, then adding ALL of the combined dry ingredients.  All brown sugar all but guarantees these will be as soft as their name says they will be, and the spice is just right.  They're not just good, they're \"D\" good. No wonder the submitter's friends ask her for this recipe!",

I did add a half teaspoon of salt when I added the dry ingredients. I LOVED that this dough was ready to go, it did not need to be chilled at all, probably due to the recipe using shortening. My cookies were done at just over nine minutes. I pulled them off the sheet to cool on the countertop and they turned out absolutely perfect.....like bakery spice cookies!",

I used real butter instead of shortening, which I softened first, and added 1/4 tsp. of salt along with an extra pinch or two of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Delicious!!",
