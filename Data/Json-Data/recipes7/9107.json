I don't care for \"crumb topping\" so I just combined it all and it was just fine. I highly suggest reading the review by Lorraine Hussain written on September 16 2014. The addition of almond flour/meal and almond extract is in the perfect proportions and tastes so comforting. In addition to Lorraine's suggestions I sprinkled sliced almonds over the top before baking-delish! This is a great basic recipe; easily tweaked to get the flavor you like.",
