Since I knew the pears were going to be soft I decided to give it a contrasting texture by using 1 1/2 C of oatmeal (since it's what I had I used rolled/any is fine) 1/4 C of flour instead of all flour. For the brown sugar I used the brown sugar Splenda to cut the carbs and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 C. Since I only had 1 Tbsp of maple syrup that is all I drizzled on the pears. I decide based on another suggestion to add the butter on top of the dry ingredients instead. I mixed all of the dry ingredients and then spread that over the pears.I decreased the amount and melted 1 1/2 C of butter then added an increase of 3/4 tsp of vanilla to that (instead of mixing with the dry) then poured it over all. I think it puts the vanilla flavor everywhere instead of it being stuck in a glob. It was delicious and plenty sweet! Vanilla ice cream/yogurt would definitely be a great go with.",
