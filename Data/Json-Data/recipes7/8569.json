I wasn't sure at first about adding the semisweet chips but my daughter insisted and the little hint of chips was prefect. I left out the walnuts. I didn't have any ginger clove or mace in the cupboard so I substituted for 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I am going to make it again this weekend for an other dinner gathering.",

I also think two cups of white sugar is scary high. And finally even though they were cooked all the way through the tops (I made muffins due to lack of loaf pans - baked them for 17 minutes at 350) were very sticky and still felt moist to the touch. So why am I giving this such a high rating? 1) I love anything with pumpkin 2) they were very moist which is so much better than dry and 3) it was a pretty easy recipe and I had almost all of the ingredients already. My daughter really enjoyed them. Thanks!",
