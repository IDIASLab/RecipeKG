A few words of advice: -Your rosewater should absolutely NOT contain alcohol. As the name implies rose and water should be the only ingredients. -Your rosewater also should NOT be expensive. I believe I got mine from a small middle eastern grocery for 4.95. I think the previous reviewer may have purchased something other than rosewater (a rose extract perhaps?) which is probably the reason for the bad result.",

The flavor was good no doubt about it. But this never churned beyond the consistency of a smoothie. I have made ice cream countless times over many many years and recognize this as a recipe that's dead on in terms of the ingredients as well as of the measures of them. Therefore I think it's safe to conclude that there is a significant alcohol content in the rose water that prevents the ice cream mixture from freezing. A solution would be to simply add less but the flavor of rose water is so delicate that you wouldn't taste it anyway. Another solution might be to add the rose water at the end of the churning time to allow the ice cream to freeze and set up first but there won't be a next time for me with that. I'll leave that possibility up to someone else to take a gamble on.",

I read Naples review with caution and churned my ice cream and then added the rosewater. Voila perfect consistency! I added a drop of red food coloring to make it a pretty pink color. Also I replaced the egg yolks with egg beaters. Very unique recipe glad I tried it! Thank you for sharing.",

Although in my case I was all out of Rose water and I used Orange Blossom water which tasted great. Next time though I think I will use slightly less orange water since the citrus taste was quite strong. Other changes I made were I used frozen instead of fresh strawberries and I used almond milk. All in all I am happy with this recipe and plan to use it again soon.",

However this recipe is not sweet at all you can't taste the strawberries and the rosewater is horribly overpowering. My husband even couldn't eat it...he said it tasted like soap and it really did. It probably needs 2-3 times the sugar and about 1/2 to 1/4 of the rosewater extract. Perhaps the brands of extract vary in potency? (I ordered it off amazon fresh)",
