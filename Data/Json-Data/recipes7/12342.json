It is a colorful dish and the butternut really helps the kale. My only deviation was to omit the last bit of balsamic. I don't feel the recipe suffered with this small change. I wasn't too happy about two prep dishes and a serving dish since I like to streamline during the week. I'm glad I tried the recipe and this was a change from our usual fare. Thanks for the idea.",
