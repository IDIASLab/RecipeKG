Not hard to prepare.\" I followed the recipe as written using Costco's organic vanilla animal crackers but my bottom layer never got past the goopy stage in the fridge so when I tried to cut them into squares I ended up w/ some squishy chunks. (Of course my fingers didn't mind scooping up all those pieces and jamming them into my mouth.) I like that these were easy to make with ingredients almost always on hand and didn't require baking but I'm not sure where I went wrong w/ the layers bleeding together. (Did I crush the crackers too finely? Not enough crackers? /muse.) Their texture and flavor is like fudge and it sneaks up on you tempting you w/ a \"betcha-can't-eat-just-one.\"",

That's how you finish off Christmas \"Crack\" which is a very similar recipe and avoided the mushy unset sections of the dessert. It was delicious and wonderful for shipping as it didn't break apart too easily and doesn't go stale like cookies do.",
