I freeze them, take them out the morning they're needed and warm up in a hot oven for 5 -7 minutes before serving.",

Didn't look like this bread was going to make any kind of statement at tonight's St. Patrick's Day meal. I had low expectations, frankly.   Wrong! Everyone loved it!  (me too!) Other than using vegetable oil rather than corn oil, I prepared it as directed, then dusted the loaf with a little flour before it went it into the oven.   I find it incredible that something so impressive both in appearance and taste comes together so easily and quickly and with such humble ingredients. It's really a foolproof recipe.  I baked it on parchment paper, and in my oven at least, 35 minutes was just right. It's just a beautiful bread that is moist (because of the buttermilk I have no doubt!), tender and flavorful.  Don't be tempted to leave out the raisins as I almost did  - they really do add something in a positive way!",

I did this \"before adding the liquid mix\".  I find mixing the raisins in the dry ingredients easier than in the dough.  I needed to add 10 minutes to the time to complete cooking, but the bread came out very well.  It went well with the Corned Beef and Potatoes for St. Patrick's Day evening meal.  Have Fun!!",

I baked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes and it was perfect! Hot, steaming, moist and delightfully sweet...I almost reminded me of the taste of sweet cornbread. I made it with some Irish Lamb Stew from this site, and it was too good for words. Nothing less than perfection. I can't thank you enough for this awesome recipe!! :D",

I love the simplicity, taste and tenderness of the bread.  I have made other loaves of soda bread which I love but this is the most straight forward.  Just finished a warm piece with a bowl of spicy chili-sounds odd but, really, a perfect match!!  Update:  I wanted to add that I made some last night to give in holiday gift bags.  I divided the dough to make 2 smaller loaves...perfect size for gifts.  The dough is very sticky and I just kind of mounded it  and use a butter knife to kind of smooth it a bit.  They baked up very well at 30 minutes, nice and golden.  Awesome bread and great for toasting. Another update.  This is my go to Irish bread and I have made it many times with great success,  Today I substituted 1 cup of the AP flour with 1 cup of Bobs whole wheat flour-yum!  Next ti,e I will go half and half and see how that is!",
