The only thing I'd suggest doing (for looks as well as taste) is cook the blueberries a little bit - the gelatin layer with the blueberries was a little stiffer than the strawberry layer. Cutting an uncooked blueberry is gold in the center and a little strange looking (to me anyway)! But everyone raved on how festive it looked and it tastes just like a strawberry/blueberry shortcake in an all-in-one pan!",

Then mixed a pack of gel. The tartness of the orange juice with the sweet of the cake was soo good. You may not need to use the gel unless you don't plan on serving right away. I found the weight of the mold itself held the cake together just fine as long as it was served right away.",
