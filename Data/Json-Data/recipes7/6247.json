I changed a few things because of what I had on hand. I used 2 cups of pureed strawberries (which I had had frozen since last summer) instead of the 1.5 cups of chopped. Also, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour. I didn't have lemon extract so I used pulp form fresh lemons (just a little less). Instead of chocolate chips, I used 1 cup fine unsweetened coconut. Finally I added a spoonful of coconut merengie to the top (2 egg whites, 1/2 cup icing sugar, and 3/4 cup coconut). It added a nice variety of texture to the top.",

They were a bit bland- the sugar flavor predominates, not the strawberry or even lemon flavor, and the texture was a little weird (almost rubbery?). My kids were not big fans, which surprised me because I thought they would like them best of all. I know that strawberries are difficult to bake with, so maybe that was part of it. Anyway, it is clear that other people liked this recipe very much so perhaps it is just that my preference is different, but I will look elsewhere next time. Thanks anyway!",
