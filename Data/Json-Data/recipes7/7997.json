I took another reviewers suggestion on increasing the sugars for the sweetness and adding more white sugar was a mistake. The filling was crunchy and stayed crunchy. Hopefully as they sit for 2 days in fridge that might reduce some. I would only increase the conf. sugar. I don't think I would frost the tops with this filling as stated. I went with a chocolate glaze. Did not oooh and ahhh over this.",
