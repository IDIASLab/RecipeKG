Which seemed to make it perfect. This corn cake is very light and moist. I love the slight cinnamon taste it has also. I only used 1 cup of frozen corn kernels also. I didnt like the idea of having whole corn kernels in this if I make this again I would use creamed corn. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'll post the pics tonight!",

Also use FRESH corn kernals as the recipe states. Yes this means I used 4-5 corn long corn ears and shaved the kernals off the cob. If you use canned or frozen corn..may be why turned out soupy or didn't turn out at all. Follow this exactly and it will be perfect. I usually can tell if the recipe will taste good if the batter tastes good and wow I knew this would be a winner.",
