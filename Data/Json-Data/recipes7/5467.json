I also glazed the crust in an egg yolk wash and dusted with white sugar before baking. I added this one to our families favorite book of recipes. Will remake this one again and again for sure.

After my ingredients sat for 15 minutes as directed there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of my bowl. The juices ran all over the baking sheet even though I left a bunch of liquid in the bowl after scooping out the pie filling. I used 3T of lemonjuice since I didn't have a fresh lemon and I'm not sure if this contributed to the runny problem. The tapioca gave it a very jelly like texture which I didn't really like very much. I don't think I'll try this recipe again.",
