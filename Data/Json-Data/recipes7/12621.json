I was determined to find a good recipe to make it for her and I m so glad I stumbled on this one! The only adjustment I made was to substitute coconut milk yogurt for the soy yogurt (because my store didn t have soy). Since I did that I didn t add the coconut flakes because I was concerned that it would be too much coconut. It turned out SO well! The cake was springy (not dense or dry) and delicious and everyone absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making this again.",
