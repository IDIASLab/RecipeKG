The combination of herbs really make this taste like a cool weather dish which I like but I felt it was a bit heavy on the marjoram. Probably 1/4 tsp would be enough for me. I added fresh rosemary in the last 20 minutes of cooking (this was my only other change) then salt and pepper to taste. I could also get by with a smaller pinch of cayenne lol! Cooking times are pretty accurate. This should freeze well too. Mashed potatoes or cauliflower and a crusty bread complete the meal. Thanks for the idea!",
