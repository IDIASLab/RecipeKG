I like the taste of these simple cookies because they are not too sweet.",

The dough was like a peanut butter cookie or shortbread--slightly crumbly and moldable. I made 1 inch balls which I flattened with a fork. Baked on parchment at 350 F for 13 minutes and checked closely for one more minute. Allowed to cool on the pan for two minutes then on a wire rack. The texture is quite delicate--very shortbread-like. They have a unique flavor because of the sesame seed base and there is a very slight bitter end taste. I would make them again as my husband and teenage son approved!",

I added 2 more eggs to the remaining batter which made them more moist and sticky which seemed more correct for a cookie batter. We actually like the flavor of the first batch better!
