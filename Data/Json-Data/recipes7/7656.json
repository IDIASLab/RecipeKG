I usually use cane syrup instead of corn syrup, and depending on how sweet my potatoes are, I cut back a bit on the sugar.  The pie is not heavy on a spice flavor due to my preference (I like the sweet poatoes to take center stage), but you can certainly up the spice amount if you prefer a spicier flavor.  You can also use pumpkin pie spice;  I just like the apple pie spice better.  I don't recommend using canned sweet potatoes as the fresh gives a much better flavor, but you can certainly use those in a pinch.  As the notes states, this is a very sweet pie, and it's definitely not low calorie.  Great for a thanksiving or Christmas table, because it's definitely an indulgence.",

Oh my goodness y'all it was so good. I honestly don't know if you could get a better flavor. The apple pie spice sets it off! My husband is very partial to his mothers pie and he's funny about eating anyone else's. He absolutely loved it! The only thing I would recommend is using very large potatoes if your only going to use 2 like it calls for.. I bought regular sized ones and it was to loose so I had to add 2 more. The consistency was perfect after that. Also I had to cook it a little longer than 45 min. but it may just be my oven. It made enough for 2 deep dish pies. I will use this recipe from now on!",
