This allows for de-fatting for a healthier soup, but you need to make this on two days, so time accordingly. For a healthier version, use sucralose instead of sugar - there is virtually no taste difference in sweet and sour recipes such as this one. Using Savoy cabbage gives the soup superlative texture and flavor.",

My suggestions/changes? a) With store bought broth don't add salt until the end then add only a touch at a time. once the salt limit is reached it can be over reached quickly. b) if you want a more savory version add plenty of pepper at the beginning (to taste) and then add salt to taste at the end. c) if you want a sweeter version use red cabbage then at the end correct seasonings using balsamic vinegar lemon juice sugar and then add salt only if needed - leaving out pepper entirely.... an utterly different soup but a great change of pace.",
