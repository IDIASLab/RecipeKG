Well, I tried it - I cooked it in about an 8\" x 11\" glass pan so it took a bit longer, I made my cream cheese frosting from my other recipe and wow - it came out GREAT.  I used Cup 4 Cup. Only thing I changed was I added some ch. walnuts to the batter.  When he bit into it -- he said it was \"stunning\"..  :D  and I have to agree. He must've raved about it 4 times since. He still doesn't even know it's gf, and he always can tell and asks.  He didn't even ask!! And I didn't tell him!   GREAT RECIPE, will make often.",

I used cup 4 cup gluten free flour  which I think is the best all around all purpose gluten free flour.   The cake wasn't too heavy and was very moist, but, it was a little spongy.   It is a pretty basic carrot cake for those that don't like additions like pineapple, coconut, or nuts.  It is also not a thick cake.  It is about the height you would get if you made a cake in a sheet pan.",
