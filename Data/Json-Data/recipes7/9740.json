They were barely edible let alone good enough to bring to the party I was attending that evening. I cooked the bites at 375 degrees for 8-9 minutes. They came out much better. At the proper cooking time the bites are very good. I am giving this recipe three stars because the recipe is not good if it is followed exactly.",
