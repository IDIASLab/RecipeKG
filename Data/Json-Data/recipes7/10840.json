My kiddo doesn't like the chunks of mandarin so I usually blend up the mandarins into the batter. Family loves them as is but they are better with pineapple chunks. Something odd about these... when they are fresh from the oven they stick to the paper liner. After a few hours they peel off the paper just fine. Weird. Original: I always hesitate to rate a recipe that I've changed but I know other people may benefit from my changes. I suspect this would have been 5 stars had I followed the recipe exactly. Since coconut is supposed to be so good for you I subbed 1/4 C coconut oil 1/4 C butter for the margarine. I used 1.5 C gluten-free flour 1/2 C coconut flour. And I used fresh oranges. The coconut overpowered the other flavors a little but that was to be expected I guess. My family really enjoyed it and it will become a regular. I think it would also be good with pineapple instead of/or in addition to the oranges.",

I sub'd a few things for added nutrition: 1/2 cup spelt flour for reg flour 1/2 cup brown sugar for white sugar and added 1 cup chopped walnuts in lieu of the mandarines as i didn't have any on hand. The batter itself was really good-tasted like cake! It also took a little longer to cook about 10 mins (maybe because i sub'd some spelt flour in there). Very good muffin recipe. It's seems more \"treaty\" than breakfasty but who doesn't want cake for breakfast?!",
