To the reviewers who said that they had too much liquid after baking or that the crust never rose to the top, YOU USED THE WRONG TYPE OF FLOUR. This recipe calls for self-rising flour, NOT all-purpose, and there is a difference!\nI made this as directed, subbing cinnamon for the 5-spice powder (I have simple tastes!) and it turned out wonderfully and was delicious!\nA little trick for helping it to set better. After the bake time is over, turn the heat off and let the cobbler remain in the oven for a while to cool. This will let any remaining liquid boil off while not burning the dessert.\nYou should eat this warm though, rather than room temp. (Just my opinion!)\nAll in all, this is a great recipe. You can't go wrong with Chef John!",

I did feel weird using two cups of sugar, one for the syrup and one for the crust, I should have trusted my gut instinct because it was way too sweet. Also the Chinese spices killed it, that anise flavor is hard to get rid off and is too strong. So I just bought another set of peaches and will try this again with only one cup of sugar and cinnamon. We'll see how it comes out.\nUPDATE: I made this again last night and only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup of water for the syrup. 1/2 of white sugar to mix with the flour. Melted the butter in the oven in the same baking dish. Replaced the Chinese five-spice with 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Result: AMAZING.",

Do not increase the temp or cooking time it was perfect as written.  I turned the temp to 375 as suggested and the cobbler was browing was too fast.  350 is perfect.  I used Vietnamese cinnamom instead of 5 spice powder and added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to the peaches to keep the color bright and add freshness.  As suggested, I did not add all the syrup to the the baking dish (discarded about 1/2 a cup).  I wonder if some did not use self-rising flour.  That is key.  I used the recipe from this site for SR flour.  Turned out perfect-golden brown, buttery and not too sweet.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.",
