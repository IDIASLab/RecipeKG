I put them in convection oven at 340 degrees for 8 minutes and they turned out well; moist and very much like a sugar cookie consistency! Made the glaze per recipe and it was wayyyy too much; the cookies were drowning and I still have leftover glaze! I think next time I will either halve that part or omit completely. Very good recipe and love the flavor combination; I will definitely be making these again :)",
