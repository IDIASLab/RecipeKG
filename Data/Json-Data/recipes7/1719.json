I stirred in the amount of sugar vannila extract and spice. Then I filled the glass up the rest of the way with coffee. My coffee machine doesnt have a \"strong brew\" button like I've seen on other coffee machines so I just doubled the amount of coffee I put in it. For 4 cups I added two scoops (a little more than 2 tablespoons). The spice does not dissolve fully and likes to settle to the bottom I just keep a spoon in my cup to stir it back up every once in a while. I also doubled the spice because my glass holds a little more than typical coffee mugs and I just really like pumpkin flavor. This was a wonderful recipe and I will defidently be making it over and over again!",

We used 1 cups of 2% milk a tablespoon of sugar around tsp vanilla a couple shakes of cinnamon and a shake each of nutmeg cloves and ginger (most pumpkin pie spices are a mixture of these four spices). We used about half of the milk mixture and half of a strong Christmas-y coffee and we stirred in a couple tablespoons of whipped topping. Really good! Oh and I didn't use a blender but I whisked the hot milk mixture until it was frothy (took a minute or two). Awesome although some spices settled to the bottom. Oh well.:) Thanks for sharing Zippy!",
