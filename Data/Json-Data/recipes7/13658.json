It's not entirely vegan as chocolate is adulterated with milk and some types white sugar is processed with animal bone char, the refined kind of sugar. I used Billington's sugar and Lindt chocolate as vegan substitutes. Overall though, the cake turned out AMAZING!! I would recommend this again. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!",
