This year I decided to switch it up with Chef John's spicy twist to the predictable Deviled Egg, and I'm never going back! Deviled Eggs do not have to be made standard, or with boundaries.... Mix it up, adjust the spice to your liking, and \"never make it the same twice, because that's no fun!\".\nEach time I have made them, I use a little more of this and a little less of that, mainly adjusting the level of spice according to the party I am serving. My advice, mix up the yolks according to the recipe, taste and adjust! A little trick my Mom taught me is to put the eggs in ice water to cool them down and to help the egg shells come off clean and easy. Just make sure you allow enough time for cooking, because the ice water will stop the cooking process. I put a dozen to 18 eggs in a cold pot, cover with water and cook on high until the water boils. Turn the heat down a little so the water stays on a steady boil, but not a rough rapid boil, cover and cook for 8 minutes. \nThank you Chef John for all of your videos, I am a visual learner and your videos have given me confidence to make things I didn't know I could!",
