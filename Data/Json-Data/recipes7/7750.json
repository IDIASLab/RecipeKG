Would've been a 5-star meal, but most of it charred.\" So I followed this recipe exactly, but was skittish of 6 hrs. on high, so I went w/ the low setting - it smelled amazing most of the day and at around the 5 hr. mark, took on a burning-pizza-aroma. Ugh! The zucchini was burnt in most places to the bottom of the crockpot, and spots of the sausage on top were crunchified. Funny thing is though, it tasted really awesome, but just shouldn't have been in nearly that long. My husband said the picture that I took of it looked like doodie, but I had to post it anyway (the 1 of the 4 zucchini boats that I was able to yank out w/o losing burny bits at the bottom.) I'll gladly make it again, but probably opt to stick it in the oven instead.",

I hollowed the zucchini and stuffed it with cooked hot turkey italian sausage and pizza sauce.  I layered them in the slow cooker, added a little water, cooked for two hours on low, then was able to place them side by side in the cooker for another two hours.  I switched to high and added grated mozzarella for a hour.  To serve, added sliced ripe olives and chopped green onions.  Delish and so simple.  Having the rest tonight...:) Thanks for the recipe!",
