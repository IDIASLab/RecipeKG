I tweaked it a bit - used mozzarella cheese and crushed red pepper instead of mont jack (what I had onhand) and I added cottage cheese for some protein. Combined all the filling ingredients (in my case - cott cheese mushrooms scallions pepperoni green pepper real bacon black olives cheddar and mozz cheese along with Italian seasoning) with part marinara/part pizza sauce (again - using up ingred I had onhand) - stuffed shells topped w/more sauce cheese and sprinkled w/parm cheese. So yummy and it made tons (plus was able to assemble it early in the day bake later serving alongside texas toast salad and steamed asparagus - great meal!)",

I did had some crushed red pepper and garlic powder to the sauce just as a personal preference. I used mozzarella only because I forgot the Monterey jack but I think a mixture would be even better. My little guy went crazy for them. Thanks for the awesome recipe!",

I just mixed it all together (including the pepperoni) and filled the shells. I put them into the baking dish and topped them w/ the sauce cheese and some extra mini pepperoni. I baked them about 30 mins. covered w/ foil then removed the foil and baked about 10 mins. longer. These had great flavor! I loved the concept of these and love the fact that you can pretty much use any of your favorite pizza toppings (I'm planning to add some sliced black olives next time as well). Family really enjoyed these and I will be making them again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
