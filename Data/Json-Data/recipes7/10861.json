Instead of following this recipe as-is I took bits of it and changed the proportions and followed Budget Bytes sesame chicken recipe, sans the corn starch and vegetable oil. And I recommend these main changes for (1lb of  beef)\n\n-Increase the portion of vinegar to 3 tablespoons\n-Sugar 1/4 cup or 3 tablespoons (best to go with your preference)\n-1/2cup of ketchup (for thickening)\n1/2 an onion thinly sliced (I mixed in green onions as well)\nThen include the other ingredients for the sauce in the budget bytes recipe but no need for sesame seeds.\n\nBasically I may have created a new recipe but it turned out great and I'll give credit where it is due. If any doubts in the sauce taste it before you slather your meat in it, it should have a tangy taste. Best Wishes!",
