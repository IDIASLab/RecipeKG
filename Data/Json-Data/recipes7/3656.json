On the plus side, the chicken came out wonderfully and very moist, and the potatoes were also delicious and made the stew very filling.  The preparation was also extremely simple; the most time-consuming part was cubing the chicken.  That said, even having left out the celery salt (which I didn't have), I found this stew much too salty.  This coming from a guy who considers salt to be its own food group; I put it on virtually everything.  In retrospect, I think that the only problem was that 6 bouillon cubes is far too much. I ended up adding two cups of whole milk to try and mellow it out without hurting the creaminess, which did help somewhat.  But the bouillon just ended up giving the whole thing that salty, artificial chicken flavor, like eating a packet of ramen flavoring.  If I were to make this again I'd use maybe 1 or 2 cubes of the bouillon, if any at all.  The condensed soup and the chicken breasts are probably enough chicken flavor by themselves, especially if you leave a little bit of the chicken fat on the breasts.  Then just salt to taste.",

Important thing to note is you absolutely positively do not need to add the bouillon cubes.  Well, let me rephrase... 1 chicken bc does taste fine w/o being salty when you add the potatoes.  If I use grand biscuits which I recommend to serve with this, I do not add potatoes.  Kinda overdone on the carbs.  If I do add potatoes, DEFINITELY add 1 can of chicken broth and this is the only time I would consider adding a tsp of garlic salt to flavor the potatoes a bit.  I added lots of fresh garlic.  You also can omit the celery and baby carrots if you don't have them.  My bag of mixed veggies always have carrots in them.  The black pepper should really be reduced to 1/2t unless you like tasting black pepper in every bite.  I also recommend adding 2-3t of mrs. dash or equivalent or it will be very bland as the chicken has no flavor.  If you use frozen chicken breasts, just add 1 more hour to the cooking time.  This tastes wonderful.  Can also be served over noodles.  :)  Oh, and I always cook this in the crockpot on low not high.  My thawed chicken is always done in 4-5 hours on low, and I found the frozen veggies needed 1.5 to get soft.",

I will try the potatoes next time. Very easy, creamy and yummy.",

I have two very picky kids and they both ate this with no complaint. It really does taste like the filling of chicken pot pie.
