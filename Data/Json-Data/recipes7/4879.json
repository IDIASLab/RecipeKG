I added thin slices of red onion to the carrot mix and while I was warming up the vinegar and sugar mixture I added 1/4 cup more sugar a 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 cup of whole cranberries. Not only was it a dish of delish but it was absolutely gorgeous! The cranberries turned the onions and marinade a lovely pink that looks lovely on a buffet next to luncheon meats and cheeses, rolls and other sammie fixings. I will make the original recipe but I will also continue to have fun playing with it. Thanks so much for posting it!",

Even the small 6 inch X 3 in diameter piece I used filled a quart jar it took 2 cups of pickling syrup to cover them. For something that big a weight or practical way to measure it is needed. The size of jar would be a good thing to add as well that would help cooks to know what to expect. I made the recipe it should turn out fine as its pretty standard. I boiled the syrup to kill any bacteria just heating it will shorten its shelf life.",
