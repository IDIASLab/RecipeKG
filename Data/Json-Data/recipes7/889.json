Great recipe we will use it for all major holidays along with the 7 layer jello and pretzel jello.",

I've always for some reason used Strawberries but used Raspberry Jello...very good combination. Good with and without banana. Thanks for sharing this very nice jello salad. Will continue to use this recipe every Thanksgiving Christmas and Easter. I'd like to try...crushed pineapple/lime or lemon jello. Canned mandarin oranges with Orange jello. EDIT..If you let the jello and fruit mixture thickin a little in the fridge for about an hour to an hour and a half the sour cream mixes much better. I have a problem with the fruit going to the top and the sourcream to the bottom. Hope I explained myself well enough:)",
