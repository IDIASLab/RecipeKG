I liked them with the crumb topping and they gave them a pretty look. Hubby took them to work this morning and they went over so-so (by comparison, I made regular cinnamon friendship bread for them and I heard raves all day long) I probably will make these again but tweak the recipe alot.\nI will say that I really liked this recipe because it used 2 cups of Friendship Bread starter - not only did it make the muffins puff up alot and look really cute, but it got rid of 2 bags of starter so i didnt have to find as many \"friends\" ",

My family loved this bread so much that the boxed brand banana bread I made two days ago is now being passed up. This bread is very moist.

Didn't have any walnuts so I didn't add them. I also added a little cinnamon and a very small pinch of nutmeg. It came out very nicely. Will be making again for years to come.
