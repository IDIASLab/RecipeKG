Made them for a co-worker's birthday and they were a huge hit...not a crumb left behind. I took previous advice and made them full size, not mini.  They made approximately 18.  I also added a bit less butter in the batter as was suggested and it had no negative impact. The icing was too sweet for my liking, but it didn't seem to faze anyone else!  I'm making another batch today and am going to try peanut butter stout this time for a chocolate, peanut butter flavor. Stay tune!",

Truly great with a strong chocolate-stout flavor and a perfectly soft texture. I think next time I make them I would use 1 cup sugar because they were just a touch sweet for my tastes. I also only used 3/4 cup softened butter in the cupcakes---1 1/4 cup just seemed like a lot to me (especially with only 1 1/4 cups flour in the recipe too). They turned out great and I would definitely use 3/4 cup butter again in the future. The frosting was also pretty tasty! A bit sweet but I added some salt to it and that helped. I also didn't have quite enough to generously frost the 64 mini cupcakes I got out of this recipe so I made another 1/4 batch and that covered them. My only minor ding to the recipe is that I wish that they were called \"Chocolate Guinness Mini-Cupcakes\" as I originally thought the recipe was for standard cupcakes. This really doesn't make much difference to how fantastic they are but it would be a more helpful in my opinion. I found they also needed 11-13 minutes to bake depending on how full you filled the mini muffin cups. Either way great recipe! Thank you!",
