The combination of flavors were unbelieveably harmonious, especially if you like exotic flavors of the East and the Tropics. You will be delightfully surprised by this cupcake! Definitely NOT for the faint of palette! I used Duncan Heinz butter recipe yellow cake mix.  For the frosting: 1 Tbsp of mild curry, 1 tsp of coconut extract and 4 cups of powder sugar in total and it was plenty. Next time, I will dice the flaked coconuts to reduce the stringy texture. Used only 1 stem of the basil and it perfumed the frosting perfectly. It is a process, but I believe it will be a recipe you'll want to use when you want something that can only be experienced!",

I enjoyed eating it though I didn't want to have another one. I guess I don't like my desserts to taste like dinner. However the coconut cupcakes are the best I've ever had. I made them again and made a frosting of 1 part cream to 2 parts powdered sugar- whip until desired consistency and add orange blossom water or jasmine flavoring to taste. They were to die for this way and I served them at a party...people were begging me for the recipe!",

I must admit that I toned down some of the more intense tastes...only 1 T curry powder, and just a few basil leaves in the whipping cream.  The cupcakes looked beautiful - I scooped out a plug from the top of each cupcake and filled with lemon curd, then topped with the slice of cupcake that I removed.  Then I spread some more lemon curd over the top, with the whipped cream over that, but not quite covering it all of the way.  Over that, I sprinkled toasted coconut, and topped with a sprig of very small basil leaves.  Great presentation, unique flavor.",

I would cut the sugar back by at least 1 cup. I also had a ton of the frosting leftover. I beat my egg whites and folded them into the cake batter. The cakes were lighter but they still have the distinct taste of a mix. Overall a good cupcake to serve to friends with a more adventuresome palate. Thank you for sharing mkecupcakequeen.",

She was horrified that I was making such a thing but I told her to be patient and wait for the final result. You need to experience all the flavors at once not individually. Well once she tasted the finished cupcake she was sold. These will surely impress friends. I would say that the amount of basil called for might be too much...I used one bunch and it is VERY strongly flavored. I would say just one or two leaf/stems would work just fine. You want the flavors to subtly mingle and the basil is a tad overpowering at this point. For the Lemon curd I used only half a teaspoon of curry and it is PERFECT. Very delicious and fun to make.",

When I tasted the lemon curd I thought it was still too much curry but when you have all the flavors together they are delicious!  We had an Indian-themed birthday lunch at work and everyone raved about dessert! I took everyone's advice and made 1/2 the recipe of curd and frosting and it was plenty for the dozen and a half it made. Thanks for expanding our palate's.",
