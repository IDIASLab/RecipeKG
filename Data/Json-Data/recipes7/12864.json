I like a high crumble to fruit ratio and this is the first time I've not had to make 1 and 1/2 times the crumble to have enough.  Just right without covering up the fruit. Other reviewers have not used the optional allspice and have substituted other spices which I'm sure is also good but if you have it on hand, use it!  It seriously enhances the rhubarb and the crisp. The only changes I made are cutting the white sugar in half (I like the tartness of the rhubarb) and I add the cinnamon & allspice  to the crumble mixture as I prefer the spice in with the oatmeal. I've made it as written and once it's in your mouth, you can't really tell which portion was spiced and which was not. Just a mental thing for me.",
