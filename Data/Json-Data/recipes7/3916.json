I found the sauce to be a bit spicy for my taste so I think I will reduce the amount of pepper flakes and black pepper the next time. I also used raw sugar instead of white (we try to eat a little more organically around here) and it still worked fine. I also squeezed fresh lime juice onto the final dish in addition to the lime in the sauce. And I don't think the cilantro is necessary though we used it and it was still good. Beautiful recipe! We'll definitely be eating this again!",

I didn't have fish sauce so I substituted Worcestershire sauce (as it is made from anchovies I've been told) and it added enough saltiness not to have to add anymore. The deep mahogany color is beautiful and the flavor is like a teriyaki sauce but more complex. I cut down on the cooking time just a bit (about 3-1/2 minutes each side) and it came out fine. I also left out the cilantro but that's because I thought the taste would overpower the fish.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a very simple dish if all the prep is done then it takes about 20 minutes. There is a trick not mentioned here; after you caramelize the sugar the water you add needs to be hot otherwise that sugar will clump and stick to everything. You can wait until it remelts but trust me adding hot water is easier. I also wonder if you need to add so much water at the beginning when caramelizing the sugar since it really doesn't start browning until most of the water has evaporated. I found I had to add hot water in small amounts as I cooked the fish so it didn't get too thick or burn. I did not have to cook it down at all. I don't think the green onions and cilantro at the end add too much other than that a fine recipe.",

I am competent in the kitchen but far from expert and I was able to make this with no issues. Since it's just my wife and me I used about half the fish but made the sauce per the recipe anyway which was good because I had just enough. The flavors were fantastic! I used maybe 2/3 of the garlic and red chilis it called for and that gave it a kick without the heat or garlic being the star of the show.
