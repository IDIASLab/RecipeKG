                "reviewBody": "I hope this cake isn't being passed by because of its title. The submitter calls it a bunny cake but it shouldn't be limited to just the shape of a bunny! But with only one review  I'll bet this is what's happening to this excellent and obviously overlooked recipe.  Have no misgivings about making this basic yellow layer cake.  It's merely a slight variation on the classic \"One-Two-Three-Four Cake. The lemon and orange extracts  were just the right amount for a delicate flavor, not masking the beautiful, butter cake taste of this at all. That said, any flavor extract would work - or stick with just the vanilla! I did make one small but important change - as I frequently do with butter cakes as they have a  tendency to  be dry, I substituted vegetable oil for the 1/8 cup (2 T.) butter called for in this recipe.  I  baked this as cupcakes, about 20-22 minutes.  I tasted one before it was frosted and it was blue-ribbon good.  It has a beautiful, moist and tender crumb, neither too dense nor two fluffy. A cake that stands on  its own without being buried in frosting is a real winner in my book. As for the frosting, I knew I'd love it when I saw its ratio of fat to powdered sugar and its mix of both butter and shortening, offering the best qualities of both.  Make sure you use hi-ratio shortening and pure 10x cane sugar and you will have the smoothest, creamiest buttercream  you could hope for. Note:  this recipe should make a 13x9\" sheet  cake,  9\" layer cake or 24 cupcakes.",

I may add a tad more extracts next time or even some orange or lemon zest to make it more flavorful. I used a lamb mold and there was extra cake batter after I filled the mold to the top. So I just found a small ramekin and made the extra in that. Make sure to leave the cake cool in the mold for the 15 mins that the recipe calls for; if you unmold while its too hot your cake will fall apart. Also I froze the cake after standing it up on my platter prior to frosting it. I also had to put in a couple of long skews to hold the head a bit. I was extra careful this year because last year my lamb was in crumbs (I used a box cake mix - don't' ever do that!;-)) so I may have overreacted. All in all this will likely be my cake mold recipe from now on.",

I'm not sure why some have called it a pound cake as it always turns out light and fluffy for me--nothing like the texture of a pound cake. I have switched up the extracts always with delicious results (as written it is subtly citrusy--a light fresh flavor). My family's favorite cake recipe!",
