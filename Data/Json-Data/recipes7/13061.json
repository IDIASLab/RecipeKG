For the sauce, I decreased the sugar & red pepper flakes by half. I was surprised at how sweet the sauce still was, but I thought that amount of red pepper flakes gave it just the right heat. Ideas I had were that sauerkraut or kimchi could possibly be subbed for the pickles, if you\u2019re looking for one. I also wondered what an apple slice would do. I made my sandwich with fresh Italian bread, but consider rye. I think it would make the flavors pop and be a little like a funky reuben. Definitely a sandwich you can improvise, since it\u2019s outside of the box already. It was a real treat to have something different! Thanks for the recipe!",
