I found it bland and tasted like I bit into a bunch of flour. I will maybe use another sugar cookie recipe as a base next time if I make these again. I did add a bit of milk as another reviewer mentioned because the dough was too dry. I also used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and nose so I wouldn't have to mess with a piping bag. I just put them in a little bit after the cookies came out of the oven. Cute cookies just not something I would like to actually eat. Since I put effort into these I will still give them to my sister...but I suspect she will end up throwing them out after she tastes one.:(",
