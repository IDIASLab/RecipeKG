The only thing different was i made a double portion of lemon curd and blueberry sauce and used an extra lemon worth of juice, i like it a little more tart... The tang of the lemon and sweetness of the blueberries are a  perfect match. , next time i might use a little less sugar in the blueberries, but i think they were riper (sweeter) than they usually are.  The shortcake is pretty dense and rich, but so good. I will definitely make this again  soon!! Oh, i forgot to mention, the best shortcake recipe!! I had to cook my shortcake a little longer (did not use convection) but every oven is different!",
