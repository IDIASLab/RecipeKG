The batter is quite thin but bakes to a moist soft cake. The frosting went well with the cake---work quickly because it firms in a short time. I lightly toasted the pecans before adding them to the frosting. The cake itself is a near-match for a tea cake recipe I've been searching for so I will also use this recipe for it and substitute a glaze for the frosting. I will definitely make Alaska Sheet Cake again---thanks Kim!",
