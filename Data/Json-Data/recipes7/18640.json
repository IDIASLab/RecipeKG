While other reviewers say they couldn\u2019t taste the coffee, I did not have instant espresso powder, so I used a shot of espresso and a few of the grounds instead, so maybe that\u2019s why I am tasting it more? Next time I might up both the cardamom and the cinnamon, only because I\u2019m crazy about both. And while I measured every ingredient exactly, I found that this recipe DEFINITELY calls for too much flour, to the point that I\u2019m wondering if there is a typo since my cookies also didn\u2019t spread the way they should have per the photos? Next time I will start with at least one cup less and try that. I would definitely try these again to see if I can get them perfected!",
