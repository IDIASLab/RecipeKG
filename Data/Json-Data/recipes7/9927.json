Never forget the strong Swedish Coffee or Tea.\nMemories of foodsno one will forget.",

Cane sugar is sweet, but not as sweet as regular white sugar. Make sure you drain the peaches thoroughly or it will turn out soggy.\n\nI also put organic vanilla in with the peaches. I made this for Thanksgiving and It was very good. I doubled everything in the recipe to have plenty. Turned out perfect. The key to baking it is to first put it on the bottom rack towards the burners for about 30 minutes. Then put it on the top rack for about 20-25 minutes until it's a golden brown color or light brown.",
