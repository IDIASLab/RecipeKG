ONLY ??THEN ??ADD?? THE YOLKS! ??\n\n3. Contrary to the recipe, I'll advise you to beat egg whites to ultra stiff peaks so that the rookie mistake of overfolding doesn't make your mix soupy\n\n4. Butter your ramekins in upward direction to ease the \"climbing\" process of souffl\u00e9 and use superfine sugar to coat your ramekins.. NOT POWDERED!..SUPER??FINE??\n\n5. bake them until the top has gone brown and almost matte.\n\n6. if you have a small 25 lt or 30 lt OTG then middle rack is best.\n\n7. do put the ramekins in a cake tin with okayish high walls, that should NOT go above the height of the bowls.\n\nRest is all technique.. if you are good at folding egg whites and do it all with confidence.. these should come out just perfect.. I made them for the first time and they came out PERFECT!! GREAT RECIPE??",

I have never made Souffle before, and the step where you add a little less than half of the egg whites to the chocolate mix really helped to make the folding process easy without losing volume. Everyone enjoyed the sugar crust on the outside. I also added a mix of 4 parts sugar to 1 part cocoa powder sprinkled on top. It partially melted into the top  which added a nice sweetness but left a slight crunch.",
