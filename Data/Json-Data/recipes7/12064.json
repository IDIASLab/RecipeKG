I followed the ingredients exactly but not the directions. I have found I have better results if I do not add the roasted nuts at the beginning but cook the sugar and corn syrup mixture for about 2 minutes, pause and stir, cook for 2 minutes and then add the nuts and cook about 2 1/2 minutes more.  I then add the butter and vanilla extract and cook 2\u00bd minutes. Pour into the prepared pan.  When the brittle gets cool enough to touch, I lightly sprinkle chopped nuts over the top and gently press them into the brittle, score the brittle with a sharp knife and allow to cool completely.  When cooled, I cut into pieces and store in containers.  Makes a beautiful, golden brittle which is well received and enjoyed.",

Maybe I just didn't realize how fast you have to move. Regardless, I used foil and a hot pad and pushed it around which worked well. It tasted great and had just the right crunch without being sticky or too hard. On another attempt, I tried to double it which I do not recommend. I ended up with more of a taffy that stuck to everything and would not set I could not repurpose it since it became one with the foil. Likely my own fault but I wanted to offer my experience and the advice to not double it.",

I used a combination of whole and coarsely chopped cashews and a generous 1.5 cup measure so there were lots of cashews in every bite. Very nice for holiday gift giving and a nice change from using peanuts. Using the microwave was really easy too. Just make sure you use a bowl big enough to accommodate \"bubbling\" when cooking and one with a handle (if you can) because the bowl does get hot and having a handle makes it easier to hold.
