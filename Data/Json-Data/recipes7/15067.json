I steamed my green beans in the microwave for 1 min 45 seconds and then they went into the ice bath. Dry mustard definitely has a kick so if you re borderline on spiciness you may want to start out modestly as you can always add more later to bump up the heat. One recommendation would be to mix up your dressing without the sesame seeds so you don t get any clumps of the mustard paste like I did and then stir in your sesame seeds last.",
