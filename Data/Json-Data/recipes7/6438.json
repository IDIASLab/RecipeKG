I will admit that most of it ended up in the trash but I think that was more of an indication of 5-10 year olds being the major age group present at the event. We did have several people like it my family certainly did. I ended up using sliced beets instead of baby since the only baby beets I could find were pickled. This will be going on our family make again list. Delicious!",
