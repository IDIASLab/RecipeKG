They look and taste nothing like a pretzel but the taste was fantastic! I had a little dough left so I brushed it with a little melted butter mixed with honey after they baked and put cinnamon sugar on them upon my sons request. They just tried them and they like them also. Great recipe I can see these being requested quite a bit. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!",
