Genuine condensed milk had half of its liquid content rapidly evaporated in order to concentrate the milk solids significantly. Be aware that this recipe only provides for the sweetness of the canned sweetened, condensed milk, but does nothing to actually condense it. Hence, it will not work in recipes designed for sweetened condensed milk. This is nothing more than milk with sugar dissolved in it, and other than the sugar bears no resemblance to sweetened, condensed milk. ",

                "reviewBody": "If you're looking for a homemade sweetened condensed milk recipe that tastes like your average can of Nestle or Carnation, this is it, albeit with some variations. Three stars because this is a fantastic, fool proof base recipe.\n\nThe key to any good homemade condensed milk is the use of evaporated milk. Evaporated milk is treated differently than whole milk and cream so it's imperative that you stick with it! \n\nAnyways, so far I've made several variations of this, and found that 30 min, constantly stirring on medium heat will make this thick, but not fresh from the can consistency. Definitely more syrup-y.\n\nWhat works for me, and has continued to work for me is using 1 cup light brown sugar or 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 light brown sugar (I use the higher dark/light ratio for richer desserts)\n\nNow before I came across this recipe, I used a recipe found on this cooking blog with similar ingredient ratios but a different cooking process. I tried their cooking method vs. this recipes and found the former created a thicker, richer condensed milk.\n\nThe key to getting your evaporated milk/sugar mixture rich and creamy is to constantly stir over medium heat until steam rises from your pot of choice (about 10 minutes). Continue to stir and reduce burner to it's lowest setting. Periodically stir milk/sugar mixture for about 1 hr until it's reduced to about half it's original amount. Pour into a clean glass/plastic container and allow to cool before refrigerating.\n\nYum!",

The can had no date and I don't remember buying it so out it went. I was cleaning out the pantry and trying to use what I had to make a dessert and fudge was the target. Luckily I had some evaporated milk. So I stirred and stirred and finally it boiled. I let the mix cool a little bit but was going to use in with melting sugar anyway so I dumped what I need in the fudge pot and poured the rest into a pint jar. The fudge turned out great which speaks well for this homemade mix.",
