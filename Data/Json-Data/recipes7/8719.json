We used canned Crushed Tomatoes, Tomato paste, sugar, Butter and Olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder,  and a lot of dried oregano and fresh and dried basil, one place used a small bit of marjoram in theirs but it was negligible amount.  The last year at bakery they got a huge pressure cooker to make the sauce, it took 20 minutes.  We made 200-400 dozen strips in a 12 hour day.  They sell to supermarkets and to public.",
