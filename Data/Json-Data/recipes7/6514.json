Pretty sure the cake was supposed to be 'gummy'- it is similar to a fruitcake filling and reminiscent of Little Deb brownies as far as texture. Quite nice dipped in coffee and I feel would accept additions about as well as a fruitcake. This cooks up firm and can be immediately removed from the pan though I'd wait the typical 5-10 then remove it to a rack. Throw nuts on top before the bake just like LD- only thicker in the the 8x9 I used.",
