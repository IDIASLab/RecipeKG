I think you'd be better off starting with all the flour (as with most bread recipes) and then adding the liquid as needed.  By dumping in the entire cup of water, my dough was completely unworkable and I had to add at least an additional 1/2 to 3/4 cup of flour.  They are incredibly quick to make - - - although I believe they'd benefit by some type of rising time (even 10 or 15 minutes).  I'd also probably throw a little Italian seasoning and garlic powder into dough for additional flavor.  After working in more flour, my *sticks* were 4oz each and as I said each one was HUGE, running the entire length of 13x9 pan. Needed additional 4 to 5 minutes of cooking.  Will definitely make again and thank you for recipe.",

I think next time I will add garlic powder and perhaps some other herb(s) into the dough, so that they won't be so bland.

Only change I would make is to put butter on the bread before baking but put a little more butter on after baking & sprinkle with Parmesan at that point. The cheese started to burn a little in the oven.\n\nThis recipe is a keeper! I loved how I didn't have to wait for it to rise! With doing everything in my food prossecer, it took me only about 30 mins from start to finish! Good job!",

Best pizza I have ever made. I did cut the recipe in half for a 9x13 in. pan and next time I'll probably half that. Just cook it alone in the oven for a few minutes with the butter, garlic, and parmesan then top it. After it was done cooking I added the \"crazy crust\" (garlic butter and parmesan cheese).  Followed instructions completely aside from adding a tad more flour. Will be using this over and over. Entire family raved about it. Thanks for sharing.",
