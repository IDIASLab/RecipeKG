I shredded a whole head of cabbage and 4 medium size carrots. Prepared dressing exactly as stated the day before in frig, using white vinagar, but adjusted servings for 20. Kept dressing in separate container until I was ready to serve. WOW was so good and some of my guests would not leave party till they had the copy of recipe in hands when they left.  There was none left and this wasn't the only side dish made. I think the key was making dressing the day before and letting the flavors intensify overnight.
