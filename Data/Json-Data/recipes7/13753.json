        "description": "Growing up in NYC, my family adored bagels and bialys. Once you have them in NYC, they just aren't the same anywhere else. While just about everyone knows what a bagel is, most have never heard of a bialy. I've always described them as a cross between an onion bagel and an English muffin. They aren't chewy like bagels but they have the nooks and crannies of an English muffin. My children, who dislike onions, love bialys even though the tops are loaded with them &ndash; go figure. How to eat a bialy? Toasted with butter or cream cheese. Toast and use for just about any sandwich or burger.",
