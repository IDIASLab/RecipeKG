Then set the apples aside.  I browned the bread on the skillet with the butter I used for the apples.  Then I put peanut butter on the side of the untoasted bread slices, spooned the apples over one peanut butter slice and placed the other on top.  I cut them in fourths for easier handling.

Here's what I did just in case you want to try some of my modifications. First of all I always melt my butter for grilled sandwiches so I can use less. I only made two sandwiches so 4 slices of bread but I only used about 1.5 TBSP of butter (salted) by brushing it on the outsides of the bread with a silicon brush. I did this before spreading peanut butter on the other sides of the bread. Second though I only made 2 sandwiches I used almost all of the apple. Thirdly I precooked the apple for 30 seconds in the microwave with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them. (I was afraid that the bread I was using wouldn't allow the heat to penetrate enough to cook the apple at all... I think this made a big difference. Yum!) Finally I had this great apple cranberry whole grain bread laying around that sounded like it would be terrific with this recipe and it was! My 95 year old grandma and my 9 year old daughter both liked the sandwiches very much. It was quite filling too.",

These sandwiches were good but didn't do it for me as far as being a lunch was concerned. Only change that I made was eyeballing the peanut butter which I spread on both sides of the bread.
