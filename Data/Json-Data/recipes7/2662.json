Roasted for about 1 hr 10 minutes, and let the meat rest before carving.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, it was perfect.  The house smelled wonderful while this was cooking.

I added 2 pealed apples to the squash mixture(only because I had tons of apples on hand) and I used fresh garlic, homemade apple sauce with cinnamon, so I didn't add any extra cinnamon.  When I deglazed the pan with the wine, I added the onions, garlic, and extra two apples and let everything cook down some and carmelized the onions lightly.  And just before I put it in the oven, I added a couple of small handfuls of dried crandberries for some tartness...........it turned out simply wonderful.  We gave this recipe five stars.  My husband loved it and I did as well.  With autumn being my favorite season, I will make this dish often during my favorite time of the year.  I served it with mashed patatoes, and German coleslaw from this site.  This one is a keeper.",

I'd had a boneless shoulder roast in my freezer for a couple months because there are many times that I do not like pork as it gets SO dry and I was reluctant to make it! Anyways I made it today and it was SO moist and delicious I couldn't believe it. The juices from the roast and applesauce and cooking out of the squash and onion really soaked into the meat and made it so moist and flavorful! I followed the recipe except that I put it in the oven before church and needed way longer than 1 hr. so I put it in at 250 F and vented the foil to prevent boil over- was gone about 4 hours. Pretty much fork-tender- amazingness.:) Served the veggies and broth over white rice. Very yummy.",

I consider the original recipe a fairly \"safe\" dish that almost everyone kids included would probably like. I also made this using the Cranberry Chutney I recipe from this site in place of the apple sauce and I loved that even more. That recipe has cranberries apple chunks and lots of \"pie spices\". The spices and cranberries kicked up the flavor and complemented both the pork and the veggies. I found adding the brown sugar unnecessary. Of course I added way more onions and squash each time and the leftovers were super for lunch the next day. So good in fact that I didn't even need the pork to go along with it and just added some leftover boiled potato to make my meal. All the juices had cooked into the veg and it was awesome.",

Put into 13x9 as I don't have oven safe pan and baked to temp. Still little pink in the middle which is fine with us. Great taste on the sauce. Squash was nicely flavored still couldn't get hubby to eat that though. Not to sweet nor tart. Very nice flavor on the pork when drizzled with a little of the jus. I like apples with pork may add some of those part way through next time. Thanks for the recipe SJRJA!",

Along with the butternut squash and onion I also threw in some granny smith apples and dried thyme and cooked it all together in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours. I would recommend cutting down the amount of brown sugar. The roast I cooked was a pound heavier than the one this recipe calls for and 1/3 cup of sugar was more than enough. Perhaps add more if your applesauce is unsweetened though. Either way this recipe was fantastic and totally hit the spot:)",
