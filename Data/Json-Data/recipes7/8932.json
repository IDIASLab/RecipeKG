I used part skim Moz. and an 8oz. chunk shredded yielded about a cup and half of cheese. I had two heads of broccoli, so not sure if that was a pound or not. The dressing was pretty good and not as vinegary as other dressings tend to be, I just added the sugar until it reached my sweet preference, just a bit under the amount called for, and I added in a few grinds of black pepper. I've learned over the years when you make a broccoli salad, make it several hours before serving so the broccoli has time to absorb the dressing, the longer the better, if you want crispy bacon just wait and toss it in later. This salad is good enough for company and will be in my recipe box.",
