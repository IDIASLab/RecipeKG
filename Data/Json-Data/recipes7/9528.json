We don't cook ours. Just mix the ground cranberries, sugar and half of the marshmallows and let sit, in fridge, overnight. \nNext day we just add everything else.  *Warning: it's best to drink water or unsweetened tea with this salad. If you take a drink of something sweet and then take a bite of this salad, it will definitely make you pucker from the tartness!!*",

There was no way I d be able to stir in the apples grapes & walnuts so I popped it in the microwave for two 10-second intervals just to soften slightly...it worked. I was able to then fold in the fruit and whipped cream and it did end up tasting pretty good. Think this would be a good Holiday dessert.",
