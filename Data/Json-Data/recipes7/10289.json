When making the crust I added teaspoon of cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs and butter. For the filling I used 15 oz. of my own homemade pumpkin puree. I omitted the teaspoon of nutmeg and instead used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (recipe from this site: Pumpkin Pie Spice II). After refrigerating the pie overnight I lifted the pie out of the pan and cut it into squares. This is a different version on traditional pumpkin pie and with the tweaks I made we enjoyed this creamy light and fluffy treat. This was the Allrecipes Buzz Recipe Group selection for October 4 2014 and I will definitely make it again. Thank you luvtocook for sharing your recipe!",
