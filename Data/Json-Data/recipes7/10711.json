It was a little spicier than we're used to, though a few of us loved that, but even the ones who prefer mild enjoyed it. Next time I'll sub a tablespoon paprika for some of the chili powder & should take care of it. The only changes I made were adding a tablespoon liquid smoke and white wine vinegar to the pan with the stock. I also put sliced onions in the pan, cause I have some onion lovers too. Over all, best brisket ever! (Wish I'd thought to take a photo. Not enough left  to take one now!)",

All other spices including crushed bay leaf were followed. I Cooked fat side up at 350 in the beef bullion mustard mixture for the 1st hour then I turned the meat fat side down added the spice mix sprinkling well over the top of the meat sitting in 1/2 inch of beef bullion and mustard mix. Once turned over and seasoned after the first hour I covered with foil and replaced in oven at the same temp for another 3 hours. Was very delicious tender and juicy. Everyone loved it! Would highly recommend. Especially if your a Texas brisket fan. The meat is delicious by itself or with drippings from the casserole dish. Or add sliced beef to your plate with BBQ sauce on the side with sliced pickles and sliced white onions BBQ sauce or bullion drippings or serve on bread as a sandwich or just plain by itself. Or chop meat finely for chopped BBQ beef sandwiches or stuff baked potatoes loaded with butter sour cream chives (green onion) and shredded cheddar cheese. Except for my chopped beef BBQ sandwiches or stuffed potatoes. I prefer BBQ sauce to be served on the side with a brisket. They serve baked potatoes here in Texas with 1/2 to 1 one pound of BBQ chopped beef on a massive potato that is suited for Texas.",

The meat was very tender and tasted fine when there was no seasoning on it. There was a very odd \"sweetish\" flavor to it. At first we actually thought the meat may have been bad. Maybe the mustard? Or I did add just a bit of paprika as another reviewer suggested (I didn't want it too spicy for the kids). It didn't seem like enough to really alter the flavor much. Also the amount of seasoning was just insane! I cannot imagine putting that much seasoning on one piece of meat even as a rub. There was not enough beef stock to cover the meat as recommended so I had to double that. Maybe I just messed this up somehow but I thought I followed it pretty closely. My children refused to eat it even my husband didn't eat much. Sorry......better luck to everyone else! I had high hopes for this but it just did not work for us.",
