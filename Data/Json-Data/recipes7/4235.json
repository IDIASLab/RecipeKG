I used a small ice-cream scoop and just layered the two mixtures (did not swirl). The bake time was approx 23 min in my oven. At 18 minutes, I sprinkled additional mini choc chips and chopped walnuts on top and returned to the oven for the last 5 minutes. Perfect, delicious little bites that definately taste like autumn. By not swirling the two batters together, I think the pumpkin flavor really came through. Perfectly spiced, moist, and slightly dense. We really enjoyed these and will make them again.

I admit I am partly responsible for authoring this recipe, but I don't think I've had a better brownie, and my girlfriend has made some serious brownies in the past. Using her already deliciously moist and dense brownie recipe as a base, the pumpkin component makes this easily the moistest baked good I've ever had. It's exactly what you'd get if a brownie and a slice of pumpkin pie had a baby. ",

                "reviewBody": "These are incredible! I've made them 3 times since the end of October, and i am not usually a chocolate/brownie \"person\"...although i LOVE pumpkin desserts! The first time i made them i followed the directions exactly (except i omitted the walnuts and added ground ginger to the pumpkin half). When i added the cocoa to the the one half, it became sooo thick i could just barely spread it. And when i added the pumkin to the other half, it became very runny and there was TONS. Made the layering process a little tricky! HOWEVER they turned out absolutely amazing, if not a little cake-like. The next time i made them, i split the base batter unevenly so there was a little more batter for the chocolate half. Both halves were much easier to work with this way ( i added slightly more cocoa powder/pumpkin puree too.). In an emergency i had put them in the fridge to cool the second time i made them, and when i tried one it was MUCH chewier than the first batch which was a pleasant surprise! Maybe due to the cooling process? ANYway, these are one of the best desserts i've ever had, and one of the only things i've baked where i just can't seem to mess them up! A winner for sure ( And wonderful for impressing people ;-D  ) !!",

I took orders for more and had to bake them the following weeks for the sale again.  Since some reviews stated it was too cakey, I used only 2 eggs instead of 3 and I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the 3 spices because that is what I had on hand.  Each time I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan(so then I used 4 eggs and only used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice).  These brownies are scrumptious and so perfect for a fall dessert!
