Also, I used a deeper pie plate so I will increase the amount of filling, including adding more peaches. It does puff up during baking, then settles back in. I did sprinkle some cinnamon on the peach filling before baking also. This is even better when cooled in the refrigerator. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definately make it again in the summer with some fresh peaches! FOOTNOTE: My father-in-law thought this was one of the best peach pies he's ever had!",

I followed the directions step-by-step, but I was a little short on sour cream, so I probably only put about a cup-and-a-half of sour cream in them.  I also used about 12 fresh peaches (6 peaches per pie).  While baking the first 42 mins., I covered the edges of the pie crust.  I followed Trinity's Mom's suggestion and added some oats to the topping.  The pies were out of the oven for 15-20 mins. while I prepared the topping and upped the temp. to 400 degrees again, and when I put them back in the oven I uncovered the edges for the last 10 mins., then turned the oven off and let them sit in the oven for another 10 mins. They were perfect; not runny at all.  I cooled them for about 40 mins. and then covered them and put them in the fridge to chill, and they were delicious!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!",

I'm at high altitude (CO) and had to cook the pie a good 20-25 minutes extra to get the custard to set. This will become a standard recipe for me. Thanks!",

One difference I found preferrable in this recipe was the use of sour cream instead of cream cheese. As one who finds creamy texture to be a bit overbearing this pie was just the right amount of creaminess to be enjoyable. The next time I make this recipe I would chop the peaches into smaller pieces so one bite would not have to consist of a mouthful of peach and nothing else. Furthermore definitely be sure to drain the peaches well or else the filling will make the crust soggy even when chilled for hours even days. Also don't make the topping until ready to use or else the butter softens too much and simply forms clumps instead of being evenly spread across the top of the pie. Overall it was delicious.",
