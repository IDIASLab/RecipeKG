I had cream of chicken but any cream soup would work I'm sure. The thing that took the longest was the frying because my skillet would only hold two at a time 5 min. per side you do the math. When I fried this I used Peanut Oil. I really prefer using Peanut Oil because it has a high heat tolerance which means it doesn't spatter much if at all. Make sure that when you make this the oil is very hot! Just throw a pinch of flour in when you think it should be hot...the flour should pop and dance when it hits the oil. Once the frying is done it's just assembly and it's easy. We served this with instant mashed potatoes and it was very good! My husband and son cleaned their plates and I had hardly any left over...in fact it may be gone now as I speak. Thanks so much for the recipe!:)",

We love gravy, so I doubled it using a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  (The cream of chicken soup really does add a nice flavor.)  We also adore mushrooms, so I sauteed a pound of fresh mushrooms to substitute for the canned mushrooms asked for in the recipe.  I served this with greens and mashed potatoes and will make it again and again.",

The only thing I did differently was added the onion into the gravy instead of just on top of the steaks and I also used chopped sirloin steaks instead of cube and laid them in a single layer in the baking dish instead of doubled. But either way this is a keeper and I will be making this again. I am even adding it to my every two week rotation! The gravy was perfect for my 5 chopped steaks but if you like a lot of gravy I would double it. It was very flavorful and just simply amazing. My husband could not say enough good things about it and wanted to make sure I planned on making it again!",

Instead of layering and sprinkling with diced onion I put the steak in a single layer and covered it with thinly sliced onion. I served it with cooked egg noodles which I served with the gravy as well. I baked the chicken fried steak covered for the first 15 minutes at 350 and dropped the temp to 300 and baked for an additional 45 minutes as the recipe indicates. When I lifted the cover the gravy was not bubbling. So I took the lid off turned the oven back up to 350 and baked it for an additional 30 minutes. The gravy bubbled and thickened. I would recommend cooking it uncovered before serving. The meat was tender and the gravy delicious.",
