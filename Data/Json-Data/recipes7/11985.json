What I like even more is that this soup has a thick, creamy consistency, without using fatty creams like most other butternut squash soup recipes.  Bonus! The squash can be a bit of a pain to peel and prepare, but the end result is totally worth it. An option would be to half the squash, scoop out the seeds, then cook it for a few minutes in the microwave to soften slightly. This would make peeling much easier.  I used my immersion blender to whip everything up right in the pot.  A minor detail, but step #2 and #3 should be reversed. You can cook the quinoa (step #3) while the squash is simmering so that everything is done at once.   One slightly deviation I made was to only use 1 3/4 cup water to cook the quinoa (after rinsing it well to remove any bitterness!). In my experience, I prefer a slightly firmer texture to the quinoa, and when I use a full 2 cups it is slightly mushy.  A tasty and healthy recipe overall, one that I'll be making again!",
