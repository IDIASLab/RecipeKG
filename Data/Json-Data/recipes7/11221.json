As a result, I only did 1/4 tsp. and it still was a dominant flavor. After blending I found this to be more icy then creamy, which I prefer. So, I just left it in my Vitamix until it was smooth and all the ingredients were well incorporated. By that point, it was more like a thick cold chocolate milk with a hint of cinnamon and peanut flavor. Only change I made was subbing peanuts, 2 Tablespoons, for the peanut powder.",
