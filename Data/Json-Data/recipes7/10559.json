Instead of using the traditional springform I went with one of my 10x12 pans because of making assorted cheesecakes in bar form for serving trays. I also chose to make my own graham cracker crust and tripled the cheesecake batter, what I really should have done (I'll know better next round) was also triple my small Granny Smith's, cinnamon & sugar and oats. While the flavor was there, because of my alterations, I didn't pack enough humph for that apple-y goodness (this was my opinion not my family's). The recipe is a keeper regardless of how I made it fit for what I was doing. The apples were seasoned nicely as my hubby and kids said, the crust was good. And the cheesecake was nice, firm and still creamy. I used a water bath method and when it started getting that golden color I needed. I turned off the oven without opening it and let sit in the oven an additional hour before removing. Not one crack or separation in my batch at all. Then I refrigerated over night and cut the next day. It was perfect as everyone that was sampling it said. It's a must try for sure.",

I added a bit more cinnamon maybe close to double as I did not measure as well as a lot more vanilla (I always do when recipe calls for it Love this stuff lol) so more like a good tablespoon or more lol. I also used different apples then suggested as I had a bunch to use up which is why I made this originally. I also made my own crust. I used a 10 inch spring form pan. This was easy to prep and put together. I followed the directions for cooking and it looked perfect when it came out. We haven't tried any yet as I am saving it for tonight for dessert! I can't imagine it not tasting amazing! So far the only thing I would do differently is at least double the cream cheese part as I found it needed to be spread a bit to cover the entire top. A bit of the cinnamon mixture got caught up in it though I might not spread well lol",
