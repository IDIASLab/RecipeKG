I also used a cookie scoop which is probably a little bigger than it ought to be.  I got two dozen really big, fat, cookies.

I can't say if this is the exact recipe that has been on the back of the oatmeal container as I used another brand of organic quick cooking oats but I used to make that recipe all the time and it was phenomenal.
