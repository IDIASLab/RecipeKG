The secret ingredient is the salt-preserved lemon, a flavor like no other. Serve hot in small bowls as a side dish or snack. Good with eggs, tortillas, or other Mexican food. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator.",

I found that there is a bit more liquid than I care for and may reduce the amount next time. (It may depend on the beans though.) I will add more hot peppers (maybe fresh ones) next time as we like things spicy but I won't change the spices or preserved lemon because it is exactly those things that make these amazing.",
