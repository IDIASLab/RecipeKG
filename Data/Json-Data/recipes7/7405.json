Outside of rolling the balls of dough in sugar before baking, this is exactly the same recipe as \"Easy Sugar Cookies,\" also from this site - and I am very fond of that recipe. These cookies are simply the best, and so easy to mix up I had a half recipe done in about the same time it took Hubs to shower and dress!  And that included frosting them with \"Sugar Cookie Icing,\" that recipe from this site as well.  The cookies are soft yet chewy, with a nice, buttery flavor.  Frosted or not, these are a good pick.",
