Doubt it is as authentic, but it is sure scrumptious.  We have now become Cheese Bapka addicts, thanks to this wonderful recipe, and no longer have to order it from New York.  \n\nWe incorporated the following changes to the recipe and it is right on the mark for us and is picture perfect, like Kristina\u2019s photograph. \nAs others have indicated, dough is a bit sticky and we added about \u00be cup of flour.  We added additional vanilla to the dough and also the filling.  We rolled the dough out on a huge cutting board covered with parchment paper which made the dough much easier to roll.   We used cream cheese, instead of Farmer\u2019s Cheese (as suggested by one reviewer), and it was just as good or better.  We also did not spread the cheese mixture all the way to the other end and the mixture stayed contained in the dough and spread throughout to the end when rolling it.  Next, we did not twist the dough and none of the cheese leaked out to the side of the pan during cooking time.   We baked for 30 minutes perfect; moist and delicious.",

My husband put all of the dough ingredients into the bread machine and ran it on the dough cycle while I was at work.  When I got home, I removed the dough and got started.  The dough was very sticky, so I would probably add some additional flour next time.  For the filling, I subbed cream cheese for the farmers cheese and I also didn't need the whole 2 tbl. of melted butter, but otherwise I followed the recipe and it came out fabulous.  On Easter, my family all said they hoped I would make it every year and never buy one again.  This definitely was equal or better than any babka we've purchased...even from the Polish bakery.  It wasn't too difficult to make and was so worth it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It will now be a family Easter tradition for us. (Mine came out a little dark.  My oven runs low, so I upped the temp to 375.  Next time, I'll leave it at 350 and I think it'll be perfect.)",

The dough was very sticky - I had to add another cup of flour before and at least one cup during the kneading process (almost 2 more cups than recipe called for). I also had to sub cream cheese for farmer's cheese - my store just didn't have it. The dough was tender and soft and sweet and wonderful. And the house smelled fabulous as well. Great recipe.

                "reviewBody": "Being of Polish descent I've made or had a few babkas and this was very good. Earlier I attempted to make my own Farmer's cheese for this from this site but it didn't turn out well at all. So I followed other's advice here and sub'd cream cheese. It worked very well. I just thought that there was TOO MUCH cheese. It's very rich. I would have liked a little more bread. Next time I would halve the filling and I think I would like it better. My oven runs hot and it was ready at 30 min. I know it's a cheese babka but I can see this plain with raisins added or even changing out the filling i.e. prune. Thanks KRISTINALANGER for the great recipe! Smacznego! UPDATE 12/14: I tried this recipe using canned prune filling instead of the cheese and it came out great!",
