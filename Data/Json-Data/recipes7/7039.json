I wanted to give it a try to make sure it was something I would be okay with serving because I was a bit thrown off by the smell of the dressing (very vinegary and oniony) was blown away by the taste of it already. Don't let the smell of the dressing hold you back nothing in it is overpowering. The dressing didn't seem like it would be enough but as stated by another reviewer it is very liquidy which is why it needs to sit for the amount of time stated. Its very fresh tasting super simple/quick to throw together and you don't have to worry about it having mayo in it. Definite keeper!",

As for the person who said this was too wet my guess is they either 1.) didn't wait the 8 hours before eating or 2.) overcooked the pasta so it couldn't soak up the dressing. This is definitely going to be my new \"go to\" pasta salad!",
