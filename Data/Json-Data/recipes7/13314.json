I skipped the peanuts since I didn't have any, and I tripled the recipe and used 1/3 cup bottled lime juice, since I didn't have fresh limes.  I might cut back on the sugar next time (yes, there will definitely be a next time) since it was slightly sweeter than I prefer (especially if I'm going to frost it), but that's just me. Oh, and I substituted almond meal for about a quarter of the flour. My only complaints are that it made less than the recipe says (my tripled batch was just right for one 9x11 baking pan), and it took longer to cook (about 50 minutes total). Delicious cake, though, especially served warm, and the lime taste is definitely noticeable in the end. Thanks for a great recipe!",
