This does come out more like a sheet cake than brownies, as another reviewer stated, but it\u2019s still really good. I made the following changes: used 3 bananas and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, then with the frosting, added 1 tsp vanilla, a pinch of salt and about 1/3 cup peanut butter (if you\u2019re a fan of peanut butter and chocolate, that makes a really nice addition). It\u2019s been a hit with everyone who\u2019s tried it and I\u2019ll definitely make it again.",
