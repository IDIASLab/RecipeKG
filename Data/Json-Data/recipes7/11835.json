It was overly sweet so I would decrease the sugar in the crumble part by one fourth cup.I do have to say that the texture was SUPERB. Another problem is that the cookie part tasted eggy. Weird because there is no egg in the recipe and I used only the freshest ingredients. Maybe I'll try with a different type of oat next time? All in all, worth a try.",
