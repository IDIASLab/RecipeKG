Pure laziness on part since it was late and I didn't want to wait for 5 cakes to bake and cool. I thought the frosting was a little to sweet so I would cut the sugar in that. I think combined with the pudding and frosting it just seemed like a bit to much sweetness. Also I used heavy cream in place of the milk. Think I probably used about 3 T of milk. It was very easy to prepare but I think I'll look for this recipe with everything made from scratch. But for an easy and quick cake this was pretty good. Thanks for the recipe!",

However this cake is soo light it easily crumbled as I added the frosting. The cakes stacked 5 high didn't stay put either as it jiggled while frosting the cakes. It would have been better dividing 2 cakes in half and stacking then stacking all 5 whole cakes. The cakes were soo tender that when I cut one slice out and placed on a serving plate I was immediately dealt with the dilemma of catching the rest of the cake for it split into 2 more pieces and fell off the cake plate I had it on. And I do mean catching the cake it exploded everywhere. My husband had to help me get the cake on other plates because I had my hand on one side of the cake holding it up. The frosting was quite delish but I ended up adding over 3 TBSP of milk to thin it. Don't think I'd make this again. I'll make the frosting again for sure. Just not this particular cake recipe.
