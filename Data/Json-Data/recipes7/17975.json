I\u2019m glad it worked out this way because the texture is far superior to purely almond flour cookies. I added the rolled oats but left out the shredded coconut, and baked them in one tbsp balls. Flattened some of the balls out and I love how crispy they got. Still chewy but nice, crispy and browned. Mmm!",
