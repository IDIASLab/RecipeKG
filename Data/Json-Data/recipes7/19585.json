It's not a soup you would want on a weekly basis but it is one you should try at least once before letting the title scare you off. You do need to like dill pickles to like this soup but it is not overly pickley as you'd think. The only thing that didn't work for me as written was the consistency. I knew 9 cups of broth would have made it way too thin so I started with 4 cups and went from there. 5 cups ended up being perfect for us. This will be my new to go recipe. Thanks for sharing!",
