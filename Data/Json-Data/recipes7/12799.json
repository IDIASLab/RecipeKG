I have been changing the classic Toll House cookie recipe for years, adding flax seed, grinding up Uncle Sam cereal for part of the flour back in the late 1970s.  This recipe takes them to another level.  I do wish there was a nutrient and calorie count, but I guess I\u2019ll have to do that myself.  I\u2019m at 3500 feet elevation, which is borderline for baking.  I pressed them down with a fork and stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes before baking so they wouldn\u2019t be quite so thick. Will make again!",
