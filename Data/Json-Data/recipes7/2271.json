I am NOT too horribly crazy about the dressing flavour I scaled the salt back to 1/4 tsp and the white wine vinegar to 2 Tbsp and that wasn't the issue I had. I didn't like the flavour the honey gave. I think that if I make the vinaigrette again that I'll use Lyles Golden syrup. Over all this is a nice refreshing change of pace!",
