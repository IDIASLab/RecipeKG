If you do not like this then bake at a lower temp for a longer period of time.  \n\nAlso this batter does not pour like a reviewer noted- it is thick and you have to spread it.

It is a thick batter you plop into the pan in spoonfuls and then spread out. Second the 450 degree oven temperature spooked me and justifiably so. But I plodded on curious to follow the directions as written. Needless to say it did not bake in the directed time. Not at all. I kept adding a few minutes at a time until the cake tested done (covered lightly with a piece of oil so as not to overbrown the top). But it was weirdly firm. Weird after baking as well. Weird texture. Weird firmness almost hard. I did not feel good about serving this at all. I was prepared to trash it. Hubs said he thought it was weird too. This was right before he said yum he loved it. Apparently he liked everything I disliked about it. Two stars from me a solid four from Hubs I guess averages out to a 3 star shortcake between us.",

Because so many said they had to add baking time I followed the directions from Trisha Yearwood's shortcake recipe on foodnetwork.com and baked this in a 9 inch pan instead of an 8 inch. (recipe is very similar) I was able to bake at the required 450 degrees for 15 min. I did decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup (personal preference) and thought 3 tsp(or 1T baking powder) was sufficient. I love nutmeg but wondered how I'd like it with strawberries so I decreased the nutmeg to about 1/8 tsp. This was just right for me but think I'd have liked the full 1/4 tsp. as well. Maybe I'll add some vanilla next time as well but only as an experiment. I really think the only necessary change on this recipe would be to either add some baking time (and risk overbrowning) or to change out your pan size from an 8 inch to a 9 inch size. The rest of my changes are purely personal. We really did love the taste and texture of this shortcake! Thanks for this submission!",
