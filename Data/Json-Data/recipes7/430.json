My husband is not a huge broccoli fan but since I love it I though this would be a good way to get him to eat it..success!! I think I would add just a touch more mustard I could taste it if I really focused on it but thought a bit more would be even better. carmelizing the onions gave a great flavour. I will difinatley make this again..great cool weather meal. After making this again....I do have to say the extra mustard was what was needed and a bit more spice... I wish more people would try this recipe!! It is awesome!!",

It's quite thick with the addition of the cheese and a small cup can be used as a dip for breadsticks or eaten plain with crackers. I would probably use this as my first choice for a buffet or appetizer soup. One note - I never use oregano but always substitute its milder cousin marjoram. For a great supper soup see Cream of Broccoli Soup I by Antooskin. It's flavorful without being spicy and has a thinner consistency.",

I used evaporated milk in place of the half & half as it imparts a creamy texture without the fat and calories. I added Parmesan cheese as a garnish which did help flavor the soup somewhat. I was out of my good Smoked Spanish Paprika which would have been a nice addition. I will use it next time. This would be a nice soup to serve with a panini type sandwich.",
