The first time I made these I had used a pan but then I had to switch to a griddle  after 1 pancake.  1 batch will provide for 4 people with toppings such as syrup and fruit.  They can be a little hard to flip a first but with little bit of practice you will get the hang of it.\nThanks for the great recipe.",

While nothing will ever live up to those memories this is the best recipe I have found so far. I used jumbo eggs and butter instead of vegetable oil. The recipe made 18 pancakes 6\" in diameter. Rather than trying to flip the thin pancakes in the frying pan I used 2 pans and flipped the half done pancake into the second pan. This was much easier and doubled my cooking rate. I found a wonderful Lingonberry jam at Ikea.",

It was just like this one, except that butter was used instead of oil and no vanilla or sugar in the batter.  We four children and Daddy could keep her busy for two hours on a Saturday morning when we could persuade her to do it.  Daddy liked butter and sugar.  We children liked raspberry preserves or maple syrup.  She made both plate-sized ones and four-inch ones.  At 74, I still make them for my grandchildren.  They're always a hit!",
