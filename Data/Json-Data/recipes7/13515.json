They are a little more crunchy than regular pretzels but their flavor is great! I made some with just butter and salt on top, and a few others I basted with a cinnamon sugar mixture (you can find the one I used here: https://spoonuniversity.com/recipe/make-cinnamon-sugar-pretzels-microwave). I needed to add a little more than just 2 extra tablespoons of water before kneading the dough because it was a little dry. Also, I didn\u2019t bake it for a full 25 minutes, more like 22. Anyways, I definitely recommend it! My siblings (ages 12, 11, and 9) all enjoyed them, too.",
