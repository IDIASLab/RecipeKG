Although this is a great recipe, I did alter it slightly. I used evaporated milk and cut the water in 1/2; using 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. I prefer my bread a little sweeter so added more sugar than it calls for. I also let the bread rise for about 40 minutes w/ a damp towel covering it before frying. I really like that I was able to switch the servings to 35 and the recipe adjusted the ingredients.",

These are the Indian FryBread tacos of my youth...we used to travel to South Dakota for vacation every year and I remember eating these in the Badlands...I have been trying to recreate them for YEARS with no success(no other recipe uses yeast). They were a HIT with the entire family and they brought me back to my childhood. They are perfect!!! Thank you so much!!! I could eat this bread all day!! My kids even had dessert with some leftover bread and cinnamon sugar, that's also to die for.\n\nPS I just used ground beef and taco seasoning mix, but the meat sounds wonderful too, next time I will be sure to have the ingredients on hand to make them even better!!\n\n******************************Ok, well it's been years since I started making these and left this review,  however they remain a family favorite and are loved by everyone who tries them :-)\n\nI will offer a few pointers from my trials and errors(like the day I had to take care of something for one of the kids and discovered that a 10min rest(just after dough is made) and 15-30min rise time(in disc form) makes them even better ;-) it alleviates some of the cheesiness some reviewers talk of)\n\nWe continue to eat it as a base for tacos, chili, sloppy Joe, and as dessert with honey and/or cinnamon sugar. I typically make this bread for something every 6-8wks(which is a lot in our house, not too much gets that much action and I cook and bake daily :-))\n",

These were as big as dinner plates. Make sure you have plenty of paper towels to absorb the oil. Nobody in my family could eat the whole thing. I did tweak the recipe by using 1/2 pound of Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and 1/2 pound of mild Italian sausage instead of hamburger. The Johnsonville sausage gave the Indian fry bread a kick that I really liked. I topped the fry bread with refried beans added the meat mixture and then all the other toppings. If I make this recipe again I would leave out the tomatoes tomato paste and suggested seasonings. I will fry the Italian sausage with 1/2 cup of onions. Then mix 1/4 cup of chopped green chili. I would add the refried beans and Italian sausage mixture to the fry bread. Toppings would include lettuce tomatoes cheddar cheese and sour cream.",

                "reviewBody": "The bread came out really dense and I was not very impressed. Don't get me wrong it was not bad just not as good as I remember fry bread being I prefer it lighter and fluffier. I have had this at the Native American area at Cheyenne Frontier Day's before and my husband's mother used to make it and probably learned it from a Native American as she used to do volunteer work at reservations all the time. But I should point out I also had the title of best step-mom ever bestowed upon me after my daughter ate her's so really it was not terrible. I used my own recipe for the meat.",
