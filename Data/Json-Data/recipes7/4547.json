I substituted a can of diced tomato for the sliced tomato omitted the cardamom and ghee since I didn't have them (and cardamom's expensive) and threw in a small amount of ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon stick. You have to be careful if you do this ( 1/4 tsp) b/c the cinnamon can overpower the other great flavors. There were so many flavors in this that I didn't miss the cardamom (but would've used it if I had it). Mine tended to dry out so I added quite a bit more than 1tbs of water here and there. When I mixed all of the spices together with the onion it was so powdery that I had to add more water and found myself doing it a few times throughout as it started to dry out. That didn't hurt the end result though as we enjoyed this on top of some cooked quinoa. Rice would work as well as quinoa but I was out of rice. We'll make this again! It makes your house smell delicious too.:) Thanks!",

The only change I made was to add more water than that specified in the recipe; 3 tablespoons water added at various cooking stages was not enough. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup after I added the chicken. Then I allowed it to simmer as directed. Sooo good!
