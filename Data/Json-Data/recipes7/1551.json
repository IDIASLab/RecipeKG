You can buy coconut syrup in the yellow bottles here for a small fortune (plus they have preservatives).  Once you have coconut syrup in a local Hawaiian pancake house it is addicting.  I've experimented on my own and tried some other recipes.  This one is right on.  I think you can cut the corn starch a little bit.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla at the end.  Try chopping up some fresh pineapple bits and adding them to the top (gooey) side of pancakes while they're cooking.  When you flip them the pineapple bits grill a little bit-yum!  Then top it with this syrup and you have Hawaiian heaven.  Much mahalo for the recipe.",
