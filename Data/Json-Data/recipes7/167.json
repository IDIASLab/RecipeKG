I bought Apricot preserves just to make this dish but when it came time to make it I couldn't find it. So I went to our local store and all they had was peach and pineapple. So I bought both! Glad I did because I used all of both. I mixed them and put a cup and a half in the marinade. Adding about a 2x2 grated piece of ginger. Then after they were put in the oven I took the rest of the perserves and put it in a pot on low heat I added about 1/2 a tsp. of ginger about a 1/2 tsp. of cheyenne pepper and about the same of sesame oil. WOW!!! Taste it first and then tweek it! When the birds were all but 20 minutes done then I spooned the mixture over them and finished the cooking. Don't baste anymore after putting it on. My family and my company really loved it! Almost forgot... I doubled this recipe so that is why there is so much preserves in it! I made with this a gourmet mushroom risotto found on allrecipes.
