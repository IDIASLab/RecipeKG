We've been trying to find recipies that can be tailored to our diet. This recipie exceeding surpassed our expectations! We switched the all-purpose flour for Pillsburry's multi-purpose gluten free flour and the melted butter with melted coconut oil. This tasted so completely like actual pancakes if my daughter hadn't have made theses herself I simply wouldn't have believed it! In fact I'm pretty sure I can feed it to the rest of my \"normal\" eating family and they wouldn't be any the wiser. We thought this was HUGE to share! Will be making these again and thank you so so much for this awesome recipie!!",
