If you can't find the thick soy sauce, consider mixing 2 tsp of molasses with 1 tsp of reg. soy sauce. I used a thin-cut pork loin chop. It was really delicious, and next time I'll try with tofu for a veggie version. Thanks for the fun recipe! The spiciness was cut down by the ice cold beer I had with the dish.",

The ingredients in thick soy sauce are soy sauce molasses sugar and salt. It can be found in a jar in the soy sauce section of an Asian market. Next time I will just try to use regular soy sauce and brown sugar instead because it had a little bit of a weird taste. I think that I kept the noodles in hot water for too long because they started to fall apart into 1\" pieces... and I didn't even keep them in for the suggested full 1 hour. Definitely check the noodles while they're cooking so you don't overdo it. Otherwise the taste was delicious.",
