I cooked it on direct heat for 3 hours, turning up the heat to boil for a few minutes every now and then, and the rice was still hard.  To try and figure out why, I looked at my Grandma's tried-and-true rice pudding recipe.  With hers, the rice is cooked as normal in water first.  When the water is nearly gone, then the milk is added and cooked on medium low so it bubbles, but doesn't boil.  Stir every 10-15 minutes, adding about 1 cup of milk when it starts to get thick.  Do this for about 1 hour, until the rice looks creamy and the kernels are barely there.  Add the sugar in the last 5 minutes.  ",

I've never had any luck cooking the rice directly in the milk first (always crunchy rice). So I used 1 cup already cooked rice and 1 cup milk. I cooked directly on the heat for about 30 min. It was nice and creamy. I really liked the crunch of the toasted coconut on the pudding. However I thought the rice was too sweet with all the sugar and with sweetened coconut. I also wasn't really sold on cinnamon with the toasted coconut. I'm going to make this again but omit the cinnamon and use a little less sugar. That way the flavor of the toasted coconut will be more prominent.",
