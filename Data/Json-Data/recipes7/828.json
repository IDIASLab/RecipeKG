The secret to making spaghetti sauce is to let it simmer. When finished you can either serve with spaghetti or add to ground beef for meat sauce. You can also let this cool off and refrigerate it in containers for future use.",

I made it as directed, then transferred it to a crockpot, and let it simmer for a few hours. I also added meatballs from another recipe on this website. (To me it just isn't spaghetti without meatballs!) When eating, I wasn't sure, something seemed missing. I then re-read the recipe and realized I had totally forgot to add the sugar and had also forgotten to season with salt and pepper as directed at the end of the directions. So the next day I threw the leftovers in the crockpot, added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, some salt and pepper, and just for fun, threw in a cup of red merlot wine. Let it simmer for a couple of hours. Oh my goodness, it was amazing. Served it with multi grain pasta. My favourite spaghetti sauce recipe from this website so far. Glad I gave it a chance.\nps - I also forgot to add tomato paste, and found I didn't miss it - sauce was still plenty thick enough. Next time I make, I will try adding and see if it makes a difference.",

I make a sauce close to this but without the chicken granuals (and with pork & beef), and since I was using this to make chicken cacciatore, I was like \"bonus\"!  It worked out fantastic, not only for the cacciatore, but for my daughter who won't eat my normal sauce because I add beef to it....she like it on her spaghetti tonight.  I cut the oil down to about 2 tbsp.  Don't be afraid to add the sugar...I use brown sugar (about 2 tbsp), as it does take the acidity from the tomatoes.  Thanks for the easy recipe!",
