The dough balls I cut in  pieces because they were a little large, and monkey bread you want different sizes anyhow.  The caramel I used was a gourmet caramel my wife gets for her coffee, but it wasnt labeled well enough for the picture, so I had that jar.. lol.  Other than that, it was gone the next day. Everyone loved it.  Will be making it again, next time, will add some walnuts, maybe.",

I worried they might not cook enough in the short cook time given but they were pretty good. I might cook them a little next time before I coat them. I soaked some dried cranberries and distributed them between the dough balls as requested by the other half.  It was a good addition. I poured caramel sauce I made with sweetened condensed milk in the can over these pieces and wow!",
