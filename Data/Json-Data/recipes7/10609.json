It is incredibly easy and you will wonder why you haven't made it before, once you taste it. Day-old, ugly, ripe pears that you would never eat are great for this recipe. Also, and most of all, make your food with love and encourage people as they make their own creations. It's all about the love, and when people finally sit down to partake, the experience and the way you made them feel will never be forgotten.",

You could smell it outside! Simple as could be, ten million times tastier than homemade applesauce any day. Who knew?",

I don't vary on a recipe the first time out but I came home without lemon juice (forgot to put on my list)and was just too pooped to go back shopping. I used 15 pears, 2 tbsp. of fresh Pineapple juice (I used for the Pear Honey) and a couple of shakes of ground cinnamon. That's it. Followed the process, used a hand blender and the results were wonderful. Such a pure and healthy sauce we will enjoy until I make again next year. You gotta love, \"all natural, no sugar added\". This recipe is in my book to stay. Thank you Steve.",
