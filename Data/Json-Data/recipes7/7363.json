I just let them partially thaw out before using them. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. This firmed up perfectly and had the right amount of sweetness with a hint of spice. This is one of the best blackberry jams I've had yet! Next time, I'll try this without the spices (even though I liked it, the family did not). Either way, I bet good money that it will turn out fantastic every time.",

Raised bees for the first time this year, about a week ago we got the honey soooo guess what *2nd batch in place of sugar I used honey (honey replacement value is equal 1/1) so 1 cup honey replaced the one cup sugar, I also used 3/4 teaspoon vanilla, I omitted the all spice so I used a little more ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. as for the cornstarch I used \n2 1/2 tablespoons just because I used the honey instead of sugar.....\nIT TURNED OUT EXCELLENT LOVED IT WITH THE HONEY & VANILLA!!!!
