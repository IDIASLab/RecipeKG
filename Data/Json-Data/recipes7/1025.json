I just use the imitation stuff and break it up in the food processor. I also use townhouse crackers instead of saltines for a buttery taste. A good tip for parties is to make them really tiny and serve them with tartar sauce. Bite sized and crispy!",

                "reviewBody": "The ingredients, and proportions of them, are spot on accurate for classic, traditional crab cakes...you want good quality crab meat and lots of it, and just enough egg, crumbs and mayo to bind it. The Old Bay too, is the typical seasoning. Use a light hand and mix gently--you want nice, big chunks of crab, not mush balls!  I have made crab cakes often and coat them in Japanese Panko bread crumbs, and was curious to try these as they were not coated in anything before frying. After doing it this way, I have to say I much prefer them coated with either the panko bread crumbs or even just flour before frying. Refrigerating them for a good hour or so before frying really helps them to keep their shape while cooking. All and all, this is a good, basic recipe, but really much better lightly dredged in flour or panko crumbs. I accompanied these with lemon wedges and \"Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans,\" also from this site.",
