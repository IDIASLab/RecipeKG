BUT my granddaughters just LOVED them! I think they loved the graham cracker coating so much! I did follow the recipe exactly and they didn't exactly crack on top but they seemed to be done in 10 minutes as suggested. I did use the optional chocolate chips though I think they probably aren't necessary at all. So I'll split these two reviews with a 4. Kids will love them.",
