The whole red peppers with green onions on the side add a festive touch. The dressing is a savory rice dressing with cranberries and nuts. Sure to become a year-round favorite.

It was very tasty but did lack a bit of heat I was looking for. Will be making this again as I overlooked the orange zest and missed the hint of orange it would have added. I will also add some crushed red pepper to up the heat factor. I served over rice with fresh steamed broccoli. Whole family enjoyed it.",

When basting with oil I reduced the frequency to every 30-45mins. (Keep the glazing time to every 15mins with the sauce) Had this for thanksgiving and the whole family loved it.

I just put olive oil on it at first & didn't do anything else including the marinade part or even the cooking bag. Since it was a chicken not a turkey I halved the recipe. I forgot the sugar but it wasn't in need of it. I subbed moscato for the plum wine. (A great suggestion from Manella was to sub plum jam & apple juice which I didn't have.) I didn't get to taste this \"fresh \" but leftovers were pretty good. The sauce could definitely be spicier but that's easily fixed. I subbed half t ground ginger for fresh just because I didn't want to \"deal with\" fresh.:o:D 'Had to make another half recipe sauce the next day. 'Didn't have the cranberry sauce & didn't blend it just thickened. Added 1/4c more wine & 1T sugar to replace the sauce. Not \"wow \" but good.",
