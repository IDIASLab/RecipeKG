I used half as much rice since 2 cups of uncooked rice expands into an amount that I can't eat by myself (even 1 cup of dry is still a little too much for 4 servings).  I made the biggest changes in the salsa: I cooked the mango following the recipe but then I put it in the refrigerator.  I chopped up half a medium red onion, 1 avocado, 1 banana, and a little bit of fresh cilantro.  I tossed that with the mango.  On the side I wilted some fresh spinach in a little bit of chicken broth seasoned with garlic and red pepper flakes.",

Just make sure you press it and broil it for an addition 10-15 minutes.   Otherwise prepare exactly the same.  I substituted long grain brown rice and light coconut milk to lighten it up a bit, it was very good, but I imagine it would be better with the regular coconut milk.   I cut back on the red peppers a bit and it was still pretty spicy, so be careful with this\u2026 you can always ad more; the coconut rice and mango do help to balance out the heat.   Also I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and made a salsa to go along with it, a combination of avocado, cilantro, lime and salt\u2026. YUM!  I made a batch of the marinade and used it to saut\u00e9 veggies for the side (Red bell peppers, mushroom, broccoli and red onion). It was very good and complimented the dish nicely.   This recipe is a keeper! I think I will also try it with tilapia next time as recommended by another reviewer.",

If you eat the fish on it own it would be too hot but plated the way the recipe tells you to it is perfect. All of the flavors go very well together and makes this recipe a true winner!",

The fish is slightly spicy, it would be wonderful served as is without the rice and Mango salsa but it really completes the dish when served together.  The only thing I changed is that I grilled the fish instead of broiling it.  I don't think it would have been nearly as good broiled.  I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!!",

Followed the recipe with the exception of changing the number of servings to 6 and adding a couple TBS of diced red and orange bell pepper to the finished mango salsa and sprinkling of cilantro before serving. My rice had absorbed all the water in a shorter period of time than listed (approx 12 min) so I added approx. 1/4 cup of water and cooked for a few min before adding the coconut milk and sugar. The rice was delicious as instructed but next time I will add more coconut milk/water and cook a little longer (personal pref). We are already looking forward to adding this to the rotation for our big Sunday dinners and when we have company. Thanks for sharing!",

I was skeptical about the method of cooking the rice, worrried it may come out sticky but it was perfect and I've made it again since as a side dish to other meals.  This is definitely a keeper.",

Only thing I changed was I added more fresh garlic to the marinade.  I couldn't find a ripe fresh mango so I had to use Doles jarred mango & it was wonderful.  Would recommend fresh if you can get it though.   Yummy!  Thank you!  I added a photo of our meal because she didn't have one on this recipe page.  Enjoy!",
