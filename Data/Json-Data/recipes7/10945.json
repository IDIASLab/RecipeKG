Moist, great flavor, tender crumb, not too dense (the small amount of baking soda gives it just the right amount of lift) and beautiful.  I did substitute pure lemon oil for the extract, but that did not influence my 5-star rating.  Copelandsk, I have no doubt your mother did in fact win blue ribbon awards for this cake.

This is simply a fabulous old-school cake, with the perfect moistness and density of a pound-cake-gone-right.  This is the type of cake my mother would have presented  on our birthdays, or served to company on a Sunday afternoon:  simple in its elegance, with understated decadence.  It doesn't need bells and whistles to draw attention to itself, the texture, density and flavor do all of the talking.  \n\n     That said, mine needed about 12 minutes longer cooking time, so keep that  in mind for your particular oven and bundt pan.  The top looked done, but my cake tester said it was still wet, so testing is essential.  Lastly, if anyone has ideas of serving the cake without the icing, or not using lemon zest in their icing, stop right there and choose a different recipe.  The icing takes it over the top. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you'll have them eating at your feet.",

Because I love the glaze, I doubled the recipe and covered the entire cake puddling a good amount in the center of the bundt.    Keep in mind to follow the usual good baking tips of room temp eggs and use real butter, softened. I took this into the office for a meeting and everyone loved it.  The cake disappeared within minutes after the word got out it was in the break room.  One office mate sheepishly asked if I would make it for her birthday coming up in a couple of weeks.   I have never had such a positive response to a cake that I baked and am happy to have another opportunity to bake it again soon.",
