But I needed a vegetable recipe to go with some Indian potatoes I was making for a vegetarian dinner so thought I would brave it. Wow this is wonderful! The only changes I made were to use kale instead of mustard greens since the grocery didn't have them. I also used fresh ginger and garlic in place of the paste but otherwise I stuck to the recipe as written. If you like spinach this is a terrific side dish. Be sure to use real ghee; you can tell the difference. The tomatoes give the dish a light tanginess that perfectly offsets any bitterness. I highly recommend this with any Indian meal. Thanks for a lovely recipe!",
