Get it started on med-high, but once the onions start sizzling turn it down to low and stir every once in a while.  Second I added a splash of balsamic vinegar (maybe a teaspoon at most).  Third I cooked the beans in the microwave first, then threw them in the onion mix and cooked for an additional 5 minutes or so.  Hope this helps!",

I use 2 or 3 sliced fresh onions in place of the frozen pearl onions and whole frozen green beans in place of the cut ones and it looks beautiful. I carmelize the onions with the oil and sugar for about 10 - 15 minutes on low heat (check every couple minutes and give it a stir) then add the green beans until it stops \"smoking\" (from the ice) and is heated through. After I take it off I add the fresh dill (I made it once with dried dill weed and it was awful) salt and pepper. It has a beautiful presentation tastes great and is easy to put together. Thanks!",
