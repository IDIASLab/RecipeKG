I soak my bean-thread type cellophane noodles in hot tap water for 30 minutes drain well and cut the threads into 2\" strands before proceeding to make the salad (no cooking). Chef Jamie Oliver also does not cook bean-thread type cellophane noodles in his \"Fresh Asian Noodle Salad.\" Perhaps any issues reviewers are having with this recipe are related to the type of bean-thread type cellophane noodles used.
