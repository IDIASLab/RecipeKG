I  have played around with different cheeses in this salad, and montchevre goat cheese is my favorite so far--it's crumbly, yet creamy and smooth.  I also like to add julienned apples or pears, and fresh blueberries to the mix, for added color and flavor.  I have also found that I should make extra candied nuts, because I tend to snack on them before I put them on top of the salad.  :)",
