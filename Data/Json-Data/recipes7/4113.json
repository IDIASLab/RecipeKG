The color is an awesome green (reminds me oscar from sesame st in an affectionate way) but the green tea flavor just doesn't come out. almond is wayyy to strong of an extract to go with such a gentle flavor. i think i'll omit the almond all together next time so i dont' just have a fluffy green almond cake.",

I foolishly bought matcha tea bags (which is powder plus tea leaves) instead of powder but just used my coffee grinder to make my own powder. It gave a beautifully rustic green color to the cakes although I'm sure it would have looked more \"delicate\" if I had started w/ the real powder. I made a simple glaze out of confectioner's sugar non fat milk and lemon juice (to taste) and dyed it a pastel green. Adorned with some simple gum paste cut-out jasmine flowers and they looked a lot harder to make then they were:) All in all a good recipe - thank you for posting it!",

I'm just slightly disappointed that I can't taste the green tea flavor at all; the almond extract is a little overpowering. So I would cut that in half and cut the sugar a little (I'm not much of sweets lover) next time. My vanilla may be adding to the taste of the almond extract too much as well it's a slightly stronger flavoured (from the Dominican) than most. But we'll see next time when I cut the almond. Oh I made an icing for them with 1/2 a cream cheese container a little milk a little butter fresh squeezed lemon juice and icing sugar -confectioners if that's what u call it. Dipped all 11 cupcakes (one seemed to disappear) upside down in the bowl of icing and voila! Oh ya then I sprinkled a little matcha powder on top through a tea strainer. so puurrty. now i gotta do somethin with the left over icing hmm...",

I halved the almond extract and used 3 tablespoons of matka powder. I also used 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup raw honey. There's nothing better than green tea with honey! Cupcakes are moist and delicious and full of antioxidants and calcium. For frosting I used cream cheese honey powdered sugar and a splash of milk. These aren't going to last long around here! Thanks for the recipe and the reviews. One more thing - it took me under an hour not the 2 hours it states.",

Like another reviewer I used all fatty options but I used 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce. I also took the advice of another reviewer and cut the sugar to 3/4c and used 1/4c of honey as well as cut the almond extract completely (I happen to not have any on hand). They turned out great! I decided to make a honey glaze with vanilla almond milk on top and it added just a little more hint of sweetness but I think they could have done without either way.
