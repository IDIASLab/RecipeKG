I covered it and stuck it in the freezer and let it get really cold and ALMOST frozen before I ran it through the blender again, after which I folded in the cherries. I made little frozen treat pops out of this recipe with dixie cups and popsicle sticks. I was able to get 14 little cups full. I just lined them up on a flat serving tray and stuck them in the freezer until they were just about solid, then stuck the popsicle sticks in them. These are SO good! SO good. We're really loving these little gems. I think this might be our new summer treat--thanks for sharing.",

I just put all the ingredients except for the cherries in the blender then stuck it in the freezer until almost frozen. Then took it out blended it up again then added the cherries & blended real quick once more. Poured it in my little popsicle containers & froze overnight. I halved the recipe to make 6 popsicles & I had a lot extra which I just poured in a freezer safe bowl. I don't think you actually even need an ice cream maker if you have a blender. My husband LOVED this recipe & usually doesn't even like cheesecake but he loves cherries. I personally don't like cherries but I really like this if I just eat around the cherries.:)",
