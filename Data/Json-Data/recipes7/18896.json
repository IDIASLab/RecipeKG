I used green chile olive oil, which gave it a bit of a kick, and used 12 oz carrots and 12 oz Brussels sprouts. I also spread whole rosemary stalks around the pan instead of chopping it. And instead of parsley I sprinkled chopped fresh chives and drizzled half of a lemon over everything. 450 degrees was a little high and a couple of the onions burned, but overall it was delish! I'll use 425 next time, I think. The sweetness of the apple really complemented the sausage and the veggies. My man loved it! It's definitely a keeper. I think the green chile oil made a big difference, and all the flavors really blended well. It's a nice recipe to experiment with as well, maybe adding potatoes and other root vegetables, and different oils and seasonings.",

I added fingerling potato\u2019s  and parsnips and cooked those at 425 for about 15 mins ahead of everything else to make sure they were done.
