A few additional suggestions for this recipe: Getting tarts out of a tart pan can be frustrating. I even made this great crust in mini tart pans which are expecially a problem. Be sure to spray your pans with a non stick cooking spray. Otherwise you will not be able to remove the tarts without breaking. Also I always put my crusts in the freezer for about five minutes right before baking. This allows the butter to get cold and then the hot burst from the oven makes the crust puff much better so the crust is not crackly.",

I started by making the tart shell but the consistency was too crumbly so I added an extra 2 tablespoons of butter and another 1/8 cup of sugar and it came together quite well. I used my hands to combine the dough and the warmth of my hands made it very easy to work with. I also stuck the cupcake pan with the dough in the freezer for 5 minutes (as another person suggested) then added the almond mixture on top. I followed the recipe exactly for the rest of it and the finished product was amazing! Can't wait to impress my guests tomorrow night!",
