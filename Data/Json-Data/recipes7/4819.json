I had some problems with the amount of moisture in crust.. alot of water, along with the addition of the vinegar and egg.. so I ended up only using 3 or so TBS.. USE CAUTION HERE!  I also whipped it up in my food processor.  No muss, no fuss!  I prefer my own family recipe for crust, but I like to try a recipe exactly as written at first - it's not fair to stray from a recipe then criticize it.  My pet peave!  I think your Grandma is wise beyond her years.. blackberry pies are either incredibly way too juicy or they are thickened way too much with flour or cornstarch - this is just perfect.  I did use frozen blackberries and added a tablespoon of flour to toss into them though.. just to be on the safe side.  From a former Oregonian, I can attest that Oregon blackberries are the best anywhere on earth.. we had them growing wild everywhere.. and I could never keep my horses, or my husband out of them!  Delish, thanks for sharing.",

I've been making and eating this pie for 60 years; it's nice to see this recipe published.",

I am going to mix the pears throughout the mixture instead of laying on the bottom. This is a little trip I learned years ago with making sweet apple pies when your apples are tart and lessening the sugar for a healthier pie. Pear juice is many times added to fruit juices for sweetening so less sugar is used. Check your fruit juice ingredients the next time you purchase a bottle.",

The filling was a disaster. It didn't thicken even one little bit. Very disappointing. I will make the crust again but the filling needs thickener.",
