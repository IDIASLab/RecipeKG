I increased the filling by 1/2 (using 1/2 of a beaten egg) to fill a deep-dish pie pan so mine needed about 15 minutes longer baking time. This sets and slices beautifully when chilled (I didn't serve any until I chilled it so I'm not sure how it does warm). Thanks for the recipe!",

I used frozen blueberries frozen pie crusts omitted the pecans and upped the flour/sugar to make up for the missing nuts. Amazing! I didn't even dirty my mixer just mixed by hand. Can I say more? My new favorite! UPDATE: I used a crust made of 6 oz cream cheese 1 c. butter and 2 cups flour. Chill at least an hour or up to a week. Roll dough fairly thick and place in pan. Trim edge leaving an inch or so around. Fold under and flute edge so it stands up a bit to hold more filling. I doubled the filling and most of it fit. I baked the rest in a custard cup lined with trimmed pie crust. The pie took quite a long time to bake - I'm guessing over an hour. Bake until the center is set then top with crumble. The crumble seemed like it had too much butter so I added about 2 T. more each of flour sugar and pecans. Bake until browned - using the broiler if needed. The crust baked up nice and crisp.",
