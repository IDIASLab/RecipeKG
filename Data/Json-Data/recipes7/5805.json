I got 10 good sized cupcakes out of a half recipe. They baked up beautifully--mine took just under 25 minutes. I'm really glad I had the mindset to spray my muffin cup liners liberally with non-stick spray. Even so, these did stick a little, but not much. My one issue with these cupcakes is that they're really sweet. REALLY sweet. It's the cupcakes by themselves, not the filling or the topping. That's really the only issue I have. These cupcakes are the perfect moistness and the crumb is just right, the filling is perfect, \"frosting\" is just right--it's just too much sugar in the actual cupcake. Next time I make these, I'll cut the sugar back to 1/3 of a cup for a halved recipe. I think then they'll be just right. Thanks so much for such a wonderful cupcake recipe. I look forward to trying these again. NOTE: If you don't have a pastry bag, use a ziploc bag and just insert a tip into the end of the bag that you cut a slit out of one of the bottom ends. It works just as well.",
