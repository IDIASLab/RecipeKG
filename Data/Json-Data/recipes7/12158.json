They have the perfect balance of ingredients (and not too many oats), rose beautifully, and yielded 12 good-sized muffins.   I followed the ingredient amounts to the letter, but I did make substitutions.  I ran out of A/P flour, so used half bread flour (what was on hand), used Truvia for the sugar, skim for whole milk, and egg substitute for the eggs.  I'm not dieting, but I am trying to be more cognizant of my nutritional intake each day, so I adapt and compromise when I can.  In this case, it worked, and all was good!
