Also delicious when made with whole wheat flour.\n\nThe only change I made to the recipe was to cut the sugar down to 1 tblsp, because 3 tblsp makes it way too sweet for my (European) taste, and it adds unnecessary calories.\n\nI whisked the egg, then tossed all the ingredients into my bread-making machine on the dough-making setting, thereby skipping steps 2 through 6, resuming at step 7.\n\n\nI also use this recipe for hot dog buns, and the results are excellent. For hot dog buns, in step 7, flatten each of the 8 pieces into 15x15cm (6x6-inch) rectangles, very tightly roll each one, pinch the ends and along the remaining edge, then lay out on the baking sheet with the remaining edge down. In step 10, brush lightly with the egg-wash, but skip the sesame seeds.",

I followed the recipe except to add one tablespoon of the sugar to the yeast/flour/water mix in the very beginning.  I weighed the dough of each of the buns at 3.5 ounces, and they handled a quarter pound hamburger perfectly.  I think we would perhaps like them just a tad smaller, so next time I'll do what another suggested and make 10 buns from the recipe.  They were perfect.  I like to slightly undercook my rolls like this (see my photo) so that when I toast them with butter they don't get too dry.  We had delicious hamburgers tonight with organic hamburger meat from Costco!  Yum!  Another winner, Chef John!",

                "reviewBody": "I've made these buns many times now. They are WONDERFUL as hamburger buns, sandwich rolls, or just by themselves. I use the dough cycle in my bread machine and they turn out perfectly every time. I don't bother beating the egg. I just throw it in (water, salt, butter/oil, and egg) and then I add the flour, sugar, and yeast. Most of the time, I use olive or rice bran oil instead of the butter just for convenience and it's a bit healthier than the butter. I do not note a difference in taste. I place the dough (after formed into the roll) on a nonstick cookie sheet or a sheet lined with parchment paper. I don't bother covering with plastic wrap (I use to do this but discovered it was not necessary, thankfully)...instead, I just cover them well with a light cotton dish towel. No sticking, no problems...and less trouble. I've made these with or without the egg wash and sesame seeds. They are delightful both ways. My kids prefer them without the seeds anyway. It's hard to find a \"warm\" place in my home for these to rise since I keep my home pretty cool, so I place them in a preheated (175 degree) oven that I turn off a couple of minutes before putting the buns in and let them rise for the recommended time. I love this recipe! Don't bother searching for another. It doesn't get better than this one. Thank you for posting Chef.",
