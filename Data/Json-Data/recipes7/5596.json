He was in love and so was everyone at the party. I did change one thing however I doubled the red velvet cake recipe and used one 10 1/2'' pan and one 9 1/2''  pan it was perfect and it layered great. I also made my own cream cheese frosting and frosted the sides and then put white and dark chocolate shavings on the sides and top. The cakes obviously had to cook longer but I just watched them to see when done. With the changes everyone got a decent piece and it fed over 20 people. Like I said it was a hit my sister requested I make it for her bridal shower....",

I will make this recipe again but when I put it in the oven the 2nd time I will raise the rack in the oven one space.",
