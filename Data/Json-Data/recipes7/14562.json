I did not pitt the cherries and used 2 eggs (rather than half an egg) and it was puffed, browned and a knife came out clean at 35 minutes so I pulled it out.  Having never had a Clafouti before, I can't compare it to another, yet I think it is really wonderful.  It is tender with nice crusty edges (until it cools) and not overly sweet. I don't like eating around the cherry pitts but wated to try it.  Next time I think I will pitt them and cut them so that they can be enjoyed in smaller pieces easier.  Overall I think it is a wonderful use of fresh cherries. Thanks.  Fun to try and really enjoyable.  Other recipes recommend serving it with a dusting of powdered sugar.",

The recipe doesn t say to use tart or sweet cherries but bing cherries were on sale this week so that s what I used as well as throwing in a few Rainier cherries that I had left in the fridge. Chef John doesn t tell you in his video to not pit the cherries but I d recommend that you do (the first recipe reviewer didn t). My cherries were very large so I cut them in half placing them cut side down on the custard for a nicer presentation. This was OK but I wasn t wow d by it and this simply could be because I m not a person who goes bonkers over clafouti?? Certainly was simple enough to make. I garnished with a shake of confectioner s sugar.",

With the amount of sugar I was surprised that it wasn't too sweet. There was a nice vanilla flavor to the custard. It would be good for a special breakfast dish too. I think next time I might add a little cinnamon nutmeg or lemon zest to the sugar sprinkle over the cherries. Update. Have been serving this warm for breakfast. This time I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the sugar sprinkle. It made a very yummy breakfast served with bacon.",
