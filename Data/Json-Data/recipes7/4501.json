I'm a huge dill pickle and olive lover but even this was a bit much overall dill flavor for me. I honestly think this would be better if chicken breast were used instead and slightly blackened on the grill sliced and put in the dish in the end instead of browning them just to soggy them up with the liquid but that is just my two cents. Again this was fun and it wasn't horrible but just something I probably wouldn't make again.",
