With kale being at the very top of the most nutrient-dense foods on this planet, we\u2019re always looking for more ways, other than smoothies, to incorporate this superfood into our eating regime. Used an entire 6 ounce container of Greek yogurt (3/5 cup), and added 4 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 tablespoon tahini. While the dressed out salad had a slight hint of bitterness which we found desirable, adding an extra step by massaging the kale will substantially remove the natural bitterness and tenderize it too (type \u2018massage kale\u2019 into your search engine to see different techniques). Nice recipe, QD&P.",

I recommend messaging the kale with a little olive oil, the lemon and a pinch of sea salt until it turns bright green and starts to soften, usually 3 to 5 minutes.",

However I needed an interesting salad for a dinner party and decided to try this kale recipe. It was a huge hit and both couples at the party asked for the recipe during dinner. I used a mix of raisins and dried cranberries but that was the only change. I also followed the tip to \"massage\" the kale and could really tell the difference. One note is that the salad decreases in volume after sitting in the dressing for a while so take that into account when preparing this for a crowd. Will definitely use this recipe in the future!",
