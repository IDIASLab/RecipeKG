Without either of the optional ingredients this smoothie would be rather ho-hum. I think the three reviews preceding mine over a 3 year period is a function of the odd name given to this recipe since it does not pull up in a ingredient search of smoothies or under AR s Banana Smoothies collection. That s a shame because you can make a tasty smoothie clean-up the blender and be out the door with it in less than 5 minutes.",
