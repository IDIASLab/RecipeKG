My proportions were two cups sliced strawberries and four cups sliced tomatillos. My tomatillo variety doesn't turn purple when ripe. Maybe it is sweeter because it isn't as sour as rhubarb. I had a mixture of ripe and green tomatillos. Also I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup of organic sugar. It is sweet enough. Lemon juice was about 1 Tablespoon. And I made a deep dish pie (no bottom crust). It is truly delicious and I will be making it earlier in the season next time. Thanks so much Lisa! for sharing your creativity in the kitchen.",

You can only roast and freeze so many tomatillos. This is a fantastic way to use the littler ones. I'm making up several batches of the pie filling and freezing them. Lisa you did yourself proud!",
