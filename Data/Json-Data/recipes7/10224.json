No electric mixer was necessary, because I used whip cream instead of whipping the cream myself. I used vanilla waifers instead of lady fingers because they were not available at my local grocery store. I dunked them, but in retrospect I would have also sprinkled Baileys over the top to make the cake even more moist and delicious. I disagree that there was too much sugar in this recipe; I might even add more next time! Cool Whip makes a great topping :)",
