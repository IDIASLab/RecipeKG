I used a 2-1/2\" cookie cutter and a large frosting tip to cut the whole out of the center. My yield was nine doughnuts. The recipe also did not state if the baking sheet should be greased or ungreased. Definitely grease your baking pan. The texture and taste is more like a sweetened biscuit instead of a doughnut. The doughnut was very moist. I made some rolled in sugar as the recipe stated and some in cinnamon sugar. We thought the doughnuts were too sugary.",

Used my own homemade baking mix, so I needed to add a bit more to get the dough to the right consistency. I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon in the dough, and added a tsp of vanilla. I baked these on parchment. I used the butter-cinnamon sugar topping as written. These would be awesome with a glaze, I\u2019m going to try an eggnog and powdered sugar glaze next time. Good recipe to make as is, but tweaking it will be fun too.",
