The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but decided to make a few changes when I made it the second time.  I didn't use the oil for frying the bacon (you really don't need it) and I took the bacon out of the pan when it was done.  It gets a bit soggy after you add the cabbage because of all of the natural moisture coming out of the cabbage as it cooks.  I added it back in when the dish was almost done.  I also found that it needs more time to cook, but I guess that's a matter of personal choice as to how crisp you want the cabbage.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!",

I am a southern girl who practicaly grew up on this stuff, but haven't made it for my family because we try to stay away from fried food as much as possible. On a whim I made this tonight.I cooked the bacon first, didn't add any extra oil, in fact,poured a little out, added a bit of minced garlic, caraway seeds and celery seed. I also threw in the crumbled cook bacon during the last couple of minutes. As I was making this, I remembered that my Mother and Grandmother kept a lid on it and lifted it now and then to stir, which differs a bit from this recipe as it says to stir continuously. So I cooked it with the lid on , and it was perfect! my husband raved on and on about it!",

The bacon fat will be more than enough if you follow tip two. 2)After cooking the bacon, remove it and put the chopped cabbage right into the the hot oil. Cover with a lid immediately and turn your heat down a little. This causes a fry/steam. The water in the cabbage keeps the cooking going without burning. 3)I add a pinch of sugar to cut down the acid/tang a bit. and 4)Add a pinch of baking soda to also cut the acid and reduce some of that gas that cabbage can produce.
