The crust part tasted like a shortbread cookie, and the rhubarb topping was very similar to a Rhubarb Custard Pie filling.  Go ahead, cut back the sugar, I used 2 1/2 cups, and that was fine for us.  I used all the butter called for in the crust, and I think this was a good call, as shortbread *has* to have that really buttery flavor.  I used frozen rhubarb, and that extended the baking time a good deal.  Keep baking until that runny texture becomes a soft custard. Don't use a smaller pan as one person suggested, especially when using the frozen rhubarb, that made the baking time so much longer that the corners browned quite a bit.  I think that adding a little more rhubarb could be a good thing, I think I will do that next time.  Cut to serving size while still warm, so that the crust isn't brittle, and then allow to cool even more before serving.  This allows the custard portion to firm up.  Give this recipe a try, you won't be dissapointed!",

Also baked for about 10 mins. more the center custard seemed very loose at 35 mins. I would follow another suggestion to PAM the sides of the pan...I cut along the edges when they were hot so that they wouldn't stick too much. These are deliciousssss!

The crusts are a little different, as they use less flour and less butter and add 1/4 teas. each of salt and lemon oil or 2 Tbl of lemon zest. The filling does actually call for just 2 cups of sugar.  You are also supposed to beat the eggs with 1/4 teas of salt until foamy and beat your sugar in until it's thick and light yellow, then blend in the flour and fold in the rhubarb.  Then bake it for 40 to 45 minutes.  The filling is quite thick, so it isn't at all soupy.",
