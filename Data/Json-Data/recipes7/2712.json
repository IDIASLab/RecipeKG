My grandma always orders moo goo gai pan when we eat out at chinese, so I wanted to try this recipe out and hopefully surprise her one day! I think she will be happily surprised with this one! I did change the veggies up a little bit to my liking and how it's served at our local chinese place. I added a head of broccoli and a can of stir fry corn. I left out the bok choy and used bamboo shoots in place of the water chestnuts. I used frozen peas and they worked just fine. For the sauce I did use powdered ginger and a little more than 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I had some cooking white wine that I've had forever but it didn't seem to ruin anything. I added about 1 tbls of soy sauce just because, not really sure why. Me and my mom both enjoyed this, will make again. Thanks for the great recipe.",

I added carrots broccoli and bamboo but didn't use bok choy (didn't have any at the store). Another plus it is a lot healthier then the take out!",
