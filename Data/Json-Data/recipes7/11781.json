It is however too thick in my opinion. The ratio of crust to butter tart batter was half and half. So the actual butter tart flavour doesn't really have a chance to shine as it is taken over by the crust. I also greased the cake pan and glad I did. Baking times were right on the money. Thanks for sharing your recipe Sonrisa",
