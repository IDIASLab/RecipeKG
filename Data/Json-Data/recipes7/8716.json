If the recipe was clear it would rate four stars easily. To make things fit our family's tastes I added 4 oz more cream cheese (we like a heavier cream cheese flavor over the sugar). The lemon flavor was faint so I juiced one lemon and added it. I also added some lemon zest. It was perfect for us. I wanted to eat it with a giant spoon and ignore the fruit. Thanks for sharing!",
