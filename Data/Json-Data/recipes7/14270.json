It's light and fluffy and just the right sweetness. It's the type of frosting found in most high-end gourmet pastry shops. You will need a candy thermometer for this recipe. Makes enough to generously frost a two-layer 9-inch round cake.",

I ended up having to use a few teaspoons less of butter so I recommend (if you're making the full recipe) to use 7 egg whites if you don't have pasteurized egg whites on hand. I didn't have any chocolate so I folded cocoa powder into the frosting and it still tasted great! Overall great recipe.",
