So if you are used to the watered down pitchers you usually get at restaurants you might want to add a little more lemon-lime soda.:)I drank it the way the recipe called for it and highly enjoyed it! I forgot to get the pineapple chunks so I added a sliced apple and a small can of pineapple juice that I had in the house instead. Make sure that you have a large enough container to fit all of it in also. I used a 2 gallon Igloo spout container for mine. It didn't really come out of the spout well because of the fruit but it held the contents perfectly and I used a ladle to serve it. Also make sure your glasses are filled with ice before you pour in the sangria. It took a long time to chill in the refrigerator and if you don't have overnight to do this the ice worked really well. I will definitely be using this recipe again!!",

Totally annoying little chunks in the Sangria and it takes away from the classy look of the rest of the fruit. Also feel as though the kiwi and strawberries are unnecessary. Just get mushy. Next time I will cut the naval orange slices in half so they fit in the glass! I also don't feel sugar is necessary. It's really sweet already especially with the orange juice and pink lemonade. Lastly instead of adding the soda directly to the Sangria right before serving I put ice in the glass then fruit then Sangria and added a splash of soda on top. Gives it a really nice fizz when you sip it. If you add it directly it just disappears within the Sangria. Thanks Sheila. Great recipe!",

I only had non-alcoholic triple-sec which I substituted for the orange liquor I didn't want to spring for the coconut rum so I just used Bacardi Gold in place of that (which meant more regular rum) and the only fruit I used was apples oranges limes and lemons. I am on a budget people! It still was super awesome! My husband thought it was just like the sangria at our favorite Spanish tapas resturant where we had our wedding reception. I have tried to make sangria before but this was the first time it turned out so great. Watch out for the hangover if you drink too much though! It's a killer!",
