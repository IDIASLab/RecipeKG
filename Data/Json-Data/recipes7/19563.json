I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup since I prefer things a little less sweet. Waffles took only 5 minutes and came out great. I baked muffins at 375 for 27 minutes. My husband especially liked the muffins. I thought the interior could have been cooked a bit more so next time I will reduce the oven temperature to 350 and bake them for 30 minutes. This is definitely a keeper. I look forward to trying this recipe with nuts and cranberries next time. Thanks for a great recipe.",
