I cooked mine in the microwave by cutting in half and placing cut side down in a glass dish covered with plastic; it took 15 minutes. I added a little raw sugar to sweeten. This was really tasty, especially with the crunchy walnuts. I'll try this again sometime. Thanks for a new idea for breakfast!",
