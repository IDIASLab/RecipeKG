The pumpkin part is fun and pretty but the cocoa coating just ruins it. Makes it too dark. Next time I will omit cocoa powder and use a mix of cornstarch and powdered sugar. I made these again and the marshmallows are way too moist and do not dry out! They soak up all the PS/cornstarch mixture. Liquid is sitting at the bottom of the container as they sit. Eew.

I dusted w 1/2 cornstarch as suggested and would do that again also. I was proud to put these on my table they can be addictive though and I am not a store bought marshmallow girl.",
