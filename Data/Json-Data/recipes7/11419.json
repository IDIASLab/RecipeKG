He also took a look at the video and thought it look rather tasty and it did. The Family enjoyed it and adjust the serving to 16 for a family of six and to include left overs. Everyone thought it was tasty and they mostly tast the Bacon and Chedde Yum. It's like all your side dishes all in one cake cause you need nothing else on your plate when it comes to this recipe. Just eating two gets you full and its easy to do. Needless to say my husband end up eating 4 and his Belly was happy which made him head straight to the couch. Totally a Man Meal thanks Chef.",
