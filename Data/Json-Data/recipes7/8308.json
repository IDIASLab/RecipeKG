I only had dried rosemary on hand, which I ground into a powder in a mortar before adding; that distributed the flavor evenly throughout the dish. Everything was spread out in one layer on a baking sheet, so it was ready in just half an hour. The edges of the squash cubes caramelize slightly, which really brings out the sweetness in this otherwise savory, earthy dish.",

I looked at other recipes so the second time I made it and saw that an addition of an onion also brings out the flavor. I added a chopped onion the second time I made it and the flavor is delightful. The onions and garlic caramelize and make the roasted butternut squash flavor even better. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of dried instead of fresh rosemary. The second time I made it I did use about triple the amount of butternut squash so I had to cook it for close to 1-1/2 hrs. at 400 degrees.",

                "reviewBody": "Wow. So surprised I didn't like this recipe. Actually only one person did and we threw it out after dinner. I thought I'd love it because it is very similar to a recipe that was on this site several years ago and everyone would fight over the last bit in the pan. Only change I made was to add freshly chopped parsley instead of the Rosemary shredded Romano halfway through cooking and a little garlic Parmesan herb panko. We should have loved it but I think I figured out the problem. The dish was a bit bitter and I read a few others had this problem too. I read about garlic and found out that when garlic is overlooked it can turn bitter. This recipe is cooked rather high and long. I think if I try this again I will stir in the garlic halfway through the cooking. I have only experienced this once before and that was in a recipe for garlicky roasted cauliflower on this site- it was the consensus of most reviewers there that the garlic needed to be added halfway through cooking too. Most other recipes I make that include garlic are not usually cooked at this high of a heat. Also worth noting is that garlic gets its flavor from diallyl disulfide which is a natural oil that turns bitter when exposed to air why it is important to cook it soon after mincing choosing low slow heat. It is important when cooking garlic with other vegetables (on the stove or in the oven) to add it after they have already become soft because not only does it become bitter but can burn easily.",

There are still 3 large butternut squash in the basement from last year's garden and it's May here in Colorado so I'm always on the lookout for good squash recipes. Sometimes people complain about peeling and dicing the squash but I just sit down at the dining room table, tune the radio to my favorite station and enjoy making something healthy for my family. Many vegies are prepared in the South this way; sit out on the front porch shelling peas or stripping greens off the stalks and talking to neighbors who venture by. I love the fresh rosemary in this recipe. Thanks Kristin",
