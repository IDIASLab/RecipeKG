It's the standard old-country pastry dough for kiffles and rugelach, ratio 1 C butter: 1 C cream cheese: 2 C flour... no added sugar to please  American tastes. A few more thoughts. The cookie sheet is ungreased since there's so much butter in the dough. The dough has to be chilled and stay that way, otherwise it will spread everywhere. The filling (any kind you like, from apricot to nut to chocolate to poppyseed), also should stay to a minimum so it doesn't explode on your pan, and you might want to use a little H2O to pinch the \"arms\" together so they don't open during cooking.",

Only use a little bit of filling like less than a teaspoon and you can buy filling in the baking aisle...apricot is a good filling if you re not into walnuts. 3. Make sure your kiffles are totally closed almost like a ravioli. I actually fold mine into a triangle pinch edges then roll. For some reason totally closed kiffles taste better and prevent the filling from getting dried out as it does when it oozes out of the cookie while baking. Honestly an ugly kiffle can taste much better than a beautifully rolled pastry kiffle. I keep my square small before I fold them over",
