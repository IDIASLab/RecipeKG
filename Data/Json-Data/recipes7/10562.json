I followed the recipe pretty closely but had to make a few changes to the custard element of the recipe as it was not nearly thick enough. After the custard was complete I realized it was too thin so I added about 2 Tbsp of custard powder to 1/4 milk and added that to the hot custard and continued cooking until it was the desired consistency. Although the recipe doesn't state I allowed my custard to cool to room temperature before pouring over the peanut butter mixture. From there I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was delicious!",
