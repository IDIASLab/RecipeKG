It was very easy to make really quick and had almost no clean up thanks!! I also poured the whole thing into a greased non stick pan and cooked it on medium heat until puffy. Then I sliced it into wedges. You can use any fruit topping you want on this:)",

I used a frozen berry mix (blackberries raspberries and blueberries) and threw in the 3 fresh straswberries I had on hand. I only had grape juice not concentrate so I used a bit more than called for. The berrie never poppd since they were frozen and the sauce took a while to thicken but again they were frozen berries. The custard looks so good and easy I can't wait to try it! This is my kind of treat. Love it-thanks!",
