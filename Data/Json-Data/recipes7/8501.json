(Also removed beef.)\" After the steak was browned I removed it to a separate plate and covered to keep warm while I continued w/ the recipe and its veggies returning it to the skillet w/ the cornstarch slurry at the end; otherwise I can only imagine that the steak would've been the texture of a leather shoe and that would've made me sad. But otherwise this was a really tasty stir-fry and since I knew that there would be leftovers I skipped the cashews entirely; I found that the leftovers tasted even better anyways! Thanks Essanaye - I think I've found my new favorite stir-fry (sauce) recipe and next time that I make this I'll probably toss in whatever vegg's on its way to wilty territory.",
