Chocolaty but not too sweet, these whole-grain waffles are sure to please any age and make you feel good about what your kids and/or guests are eating. Letting the batter sit overnight allows the chia seeds and oats to soften, so the batter is smooth and waffles fluffy. You will not even know they are vegan, only delicious.",
