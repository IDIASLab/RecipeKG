From that point, I followed the rest of the recipe.  The texture is light, the rolls are tender, they have just a hint of sweetness, and they cooked perfectly at 15 minutes.  Great dinner rolls, but will make good slider buns or a bun for a breakfast sausage patty.  I might try an egg wash the next time rather than brushing them with butter.  Thanks, Beth, this is a 5-star recipe, we loved it!",

I proofed my yeast by combining the water sugar and yeast and let it sit for maybe 15 minutes. I mixed in the butter, egg, salt and 1/2 of the flour with a wooden spoon and then mixed everything else up on my KA using the dough hook. I had it on I think 2 or 3 for about 3 minutes. I turned it out in an oiled bowl and placed it in my plate warmer for an hour on low. I punched the dough down and followed the rest of the directions from there. I made mine bigger and had only 12 rolls. These would make phenomenal hamburger buns! They were delicious with our stew, but I can't wait to make burgers with these.",

I don't have a bread machine so took other review ideas.  I put sugar, 110 degree milk (instead of water as some reviews said) and yeast in my KA mixing bowl.  Mix well and let sit 10 mins.  Added butter, egg, salt and 1/2 of flour and mixed with wooden spoon then added remaining flour and mixed with dough hook for 5 mins. on speed 3.  Put dough ball in oiled bowl and proofed in my oven on proof setting for 1 hour. (100 degrees F.)  Took out risen dough and punched down and cut into even sections.  You can make them whatever size you'd like.  Roll into balls and put into greased baking pan. Brush w/melted butter and cover with saran wrap and proof another 30 mins.  Bake and enjoy!! The ONLY thing I would change other than using milk instead of water is I would add a little more salt but that's personal preference.  I used 3 cups of flour and it was perfect.  Try them!! They are so easy and DELICIOUS!!!  Will not try another recipe now.",

Once I punched it down and removed from the pan it was still very sticky and hard to handle and I had a tough time separating into the pieces.  All that being said, the rolls are great, everyone here loved them and I will be making them again.  If not for the stickiness issue (and that was probably my fault some way), they are a 5 for sure because of the ease in making them and the great texture and taste.  *****Updated**** made them again and they are perfect - figured it was user error last time.  We are in love with the flavor and texture.  My rating is a definite 5+++",

I made them on the dough cycle in my bread maker, dissolving the yeast and sugar in the water before I added the egg, flour, and salt. The dough was almost too soft to make the filled chicken pockets that I used it for, but I think it was worth the extra hassle of working with a loose dough to get the super light texture. That said, I don\u2019t think two to three tablespoons of extra flour would hurt. I fluffed my flour before measuring, so it might have been on the scanty side for bread. I\u2019m going for cinnamon rolls with this next.",
