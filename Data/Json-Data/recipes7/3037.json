I used my mouli to grind the almonds--the fine grate for half and the medium grate for the rest. It turned out perfect. I made these as directed and I would agree that the almonds on top burned. I may next time just skip the egg wash on the top and go with a very light powdered sugar/water drizzle. These are time intensive but what a feeling of satisfaction at the spectacular end product!",

The almond paste would not break down but jumped through the mixer blades in huge clumps. I decided to go ahead to the next step hoping the ground almonds and sugar would help to break down the paste. Wrong. I finally dug in with my hands and crumbled it manually. When it came time to spread using the pastry bag I didn't have the strength to do more than a couple so I enlist hubby. Even he had to take a break. On the last dozen I finally grabbed a handful and manually rolled the almond filling and finished them off that way. Today I had one and I guarantee that for all the work and cost I won't be making these again. They weren't good enough to overcome the hours spent making them.",
