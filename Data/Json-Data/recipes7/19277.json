I didn't have sweet potato noodles on hand so I used plain glass noodles which worked well. I recommend being careful to not overcook the noodles in water since they essentially get cooked twice. I also doubled the sauce mix and instead of spinach and I used seaweed (similar to that used in seaweed salad) which gave some great flavor!",
