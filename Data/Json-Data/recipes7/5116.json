I could NOT get the nuts to work on top but then again I rolled mine into balls and then rolled the balls in colored sugars so that might have affected it. When I tried to place the nuts though the cookies cracked around the edges in a way that did not please me so I just did without the nut topper. If you're worried they'll be too dry use all AP flour. If you're worried they'll be too greasy then I'm not sure what to tell you because if anything they are under-greasy. They're certainly not dry or un-tasty; don't overbake them. For the record I like these a LOT better than peanut butter cookies. Thanks for the recipe!",

I ended up dipping the uncooked balls into sugar which was a nice touch (I gave up on the almonds). I also used all whole wheat flour and margarine because I didn't have butter.
