You can easily expand to larger pans by simply eyeball. Just add 1 egg and 1/4 cup sugar for every 8oz of cream (duh) and extracts to taste. I would expand cookies on the original to 28-30 and add double the butter but that's me. Simple recipe that I think you would be hard pressed to screw up.",

I followed the recipe exactly and baked it for 56 minutes--and it browned and began to crack but it still is almost like it's not done? I've made cheesecakes many times before and they aren't usually still soft in texture if they cracked on top. It's kinda weird. Maybe it needs another egg to firm it up more? I'm not sure if I would make it again because the texture is off-putting for me. I really like the thin mint flavor and it really comes through in the cheesecake; but I'm kind of bummed that it's just so soft. Even after over 4 hours of refrigeration too. I also added a whipped ganache topping to it just for extra chocolate flavor.",
