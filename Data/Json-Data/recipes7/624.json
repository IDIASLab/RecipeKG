I then added diced tomatoes cucumbers and green onions to the pasta and dressing and marinated it for another day. Wow what a difference the added veggies made to this recipe. It turned out very well and my family then really enjoyed it. It does hold up really well in the fridge for a few days and worked great for packed lunches. I will make this again as written but will then added the additional veggies.",
