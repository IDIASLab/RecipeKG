One thing I wasn't crazy about was the size (personal preference thing) and the fact that the tops of the muffins didn't brown very nicely. If I make again I'll fill the muffins cups up a little more and eliminate the single egg yolk going with just one egg. Might even trying adding a little glaze to the top.",
