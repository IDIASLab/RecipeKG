I used 3T. of powdered sugar instead of regular sugar to help with the consistency. I added about 1t. of vanilla and I also folded in some whipped cream but in the end it still tasted like chocolate applesauce. I'm going to try freezing this in cubes and use them to flavor some chocolate martins otherwise I wouldn't use it. I will say my 2 year old liked it which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.",
