However, I was in the process of making this when I realized I was out of unflavored gelatin. I did have orange flavored gelatin so I decided to try the recipe with that instead. I followed the directions and added the vanilla but omitted the lemon juice. This turned out fantastic. I really liked it alot! The only reason I am even typing all of this is to let others know that any packet of gelatin will work in this recipe. If your stuck and dont have unflavored, there is still a good recipe in this!",

It came out real nice a little lighter than when I used cream cheese only so it will be perfect for after a full Christmas meal. I will serve it desert glasses sprinkle a bit of green sugar and place a red maraschino cherry on top! the colors of the holiday. This gelatin is versatile in the presentation because it's white. You can add colored sprinkles for a kid's party blueberries and strawberries for the 4th of July... you get the idea.",

I dressed it up with sliced strawberries and canned mandarine oranges drained of course! The presentation was beautiful and I was actually pretty proud of the way it looked! Once everyone started to eat I was hearing \"Who made the jello!\" My older brother even said to me...\"If I ever need to be fed from a tube feed me this stuff!\" Everyone loved it! I will definately make this again! I would say that it could even pass for a dessert as well as a side dish! I did vary a little from the original recipe....I added two package gelatin with 2/3 cup water and I added a little more cool whip. Thank you for the recipe!",
