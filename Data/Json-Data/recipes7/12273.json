I couldn't serve sherry to all my eaters so I made individual servings some with and some without and I sampled both.  Without it it is rich and oh, so buttery, with the sherry it acquires a different taste.  I loved both ways.  I did omit the sugar, it just didn't seem necessary to me.  Thank you, Barbara!",
