The combination of flavors mingles pleasantly and yes, it is reminiscent of raspberry iced tea. \n\nEveryone at the breakfast asked for the recipe so I'd say these are a huge hit all the way around!",

But boy am I glad to have taken that leap of faith. They were a huge hit with the crowd when I brought them to a July 4th BBQ party. Granted, I didn't use the entire recipe and tweaked the cake part of the recipe based on what I had on hand. But the result was scrumptious.\n\nSUBSTITUTIONS:\n- Vanilla instant pudding mix\n- orange juice instead of lemon (not as strong a flavor, but figured put it in there so the amount of liquid is consistent)\n- frosting: strawberry frosting from All About Cupcakes\n- 18 minutes in a convection oven\n\nRESULTS:\n- could be more moist\n- a little bit on the sweet side, so next time I'll probably cut the sugar by some\n- Overall: 5 stars :)",
