The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you use the full 28 ounces of fries then you would need more than a cup of cheese and three slices of bacon in my opinion. To each their own though so add as little or as much to suit your tastes. Next time I plan on adding some green onions to the top and dipping in buffalo sauce. Great recipe and easy to adapt to suit your style.",
