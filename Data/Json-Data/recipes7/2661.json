I did not want to buy vanilla beans or a bottle of rum so I used 1/2 t of Vanilla extract and 1/4 t of rum extract. I missed the step on covering them so they came out as a firm custard which worked out. I baked them for 45 minutes. The roasted pecans and real maple syrup on top was killer. I would make this again.",
