        "description": "I love dumplings. This meat-free version is very tasty. You can add a drop or two of half and half to the food processor with the edamame, if you have some, or one tablespoon of olive oil to make the mix a bit creamier. Substitute different fillings if you like. I've used ground pork instead of shrimp and edamame, and I recently made an all-veggie version with edamame, spinach, bok choy and mushrooms. Soooooo goooooood. If you use pork or other meat, you may need to increase the steam time (after you add the water to the pan) and additional minute or two. Shrimp cooks faster than meat!",

I made it because my fianc\u00e9e really enjoys a good dumpling and we haven't found a good dumpling spot yet in our area. She said that these were among the best she's had and better than any restaurant and I couldn't agree more -- great work with this recipe! I actually didn't use shrimp and did a straight pan-fry of the \"all-veggie version\" the author mentioned in the description box by substituting 1/3 lb shitake mushrooms for shrimp and otherwise following the recipe (also with bok choy and edamame - didn't try spinach though). In addition to the sweet soy sauce I did a spicy peanut sauce I saw on another site (two spoonfuls of peanut butter hoisin sauce and sri racha mixed to taste and cut with water) which went extremely well with it.",
