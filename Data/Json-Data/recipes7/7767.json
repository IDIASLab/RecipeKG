I did use pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree, and added a few TSPs of pumpkin pie spice and an extra dash of cinnamon for more flavor. Also, I used regular sized milk chocolate chips instead of mini semi sweets. I'd say they are perfect this way! They taste even better the next day, and are still super soft!",
