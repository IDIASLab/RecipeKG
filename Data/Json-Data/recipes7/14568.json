Even make 6 more than the recipe called for it tasted like there was too much dough and not enough fruit. It was a good dough but not really flavorful enough to carry this. Blueberries are a relatively bland fruit as fruits go (saskatoons are very similar to blueberries) and with the bland batter and mild fruit it just lacked flavor. I might try it again but will definitely have to doctor it up a fair bit for my taste.",
