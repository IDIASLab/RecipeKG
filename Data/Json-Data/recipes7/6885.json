All we had was cold smoked trout slices, but i still added the oil and fresh dill and put the slices in the oven at 300 for 5-7 minutes. I was really skeptical at first, but i figured if we try it the way you told us to, we could blame you if it was weird. But it wasn't weird at all, it leaned more towards interesting. The squash itself was warm and nurturing, of course. But the salsa gave it kick and brightened up the trout at the same time. It worked! Excellent dinner. Boyfriend is stuffed and girlfriend is happy :) Thanks for the recipe!",
