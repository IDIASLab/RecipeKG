I added 1 cup of quick cooking oats (food processed down to flour,substituted for one of the cups of flour). And instead of 1 cup of butter, I used 1 stick of unsalted butter and 1 stick of margarine. Also I like to add one bag of chocolate chips (regular size) and one bag of mini chocolate chips, bc it gives a almost saturated chocolate texture to the cookie cake, and the Kids LOVE it! Excellent recipe!",

It is not a cake consistency so if you're expecting it to have the mouth-feel of a cake you will be disappointed. It's more like one of the giant soft cookies that you get at the mall which they decorate for birthdays and such. It was chewy inside with a little more crisp at the edges. It was definitely not a bar cookie either but it was exactly what I was looking for. It's the same as the Tollhouse recipe with two extra eggs. The pieces were about 1/2 inch tall in the middle a little taller at the sides. We omitted the nuts but they would be wonderful. Thank you for posting!",

This is my goto recipe for potlucks and holidays and now my partner requests this cake at least once a month! I also used delicious dark chocolate my husband brought back from England.

I have made it 4 times now each time adding different things(toppings ingredients sizes etc) and it's been a hit everytime 8) I was on the fence in the beginning on whether to make it or not bc of some of the reviews I read..... Idk what happened with theirs but I'm sure glad I gave it a whirl. I've done the following with it so far: First time made it strictly by the recipe & as I said it was perfect for us! Second time I added Peanutbutter Chips rather than Chocolate ones...Again Perfect! Third time I made it with a combination of both chips and drizzled melted Chocolate & Peanutbutter on the top. This so far has been our favorite as my group loves anything with the combo taste lol! Fourth(last time) I made the original recipe version but baked them in my Mini Loaf pans( the individual Brownie ones). This would have been perfect but I miscalculated the baking time by about 3-5 minutes (no fault certainly of the original recipe). Although edible they weren't as moist as the previous ones So overall I give the recipe a 5Stars & a Big Thumbs Up! It certainly can be made in many many various ways as w/most recipes. I will add that the timing is crucial on this recipe but as long as u know how ur oven normally bakes at it should be fine 8) This recipe is a keeper in my goody box8))",
