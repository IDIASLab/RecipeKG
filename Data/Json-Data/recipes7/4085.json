I have cooked this many times -  but it always tasted better when my great gramps made it! It's easy to make, but the flavor would never make you think that!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great basic recipe but it's missing a few ingredients that would make it traditional, \"New Mexican Green Chili Stew.\" I say, \"New Mexican,\" since few Mexicans cook soley with fresh green chili's. [they wait for them to ripen for preservation purposes & use primarily red] But after they migrated to the US, this Green Chili Stew became more of a necessary adaptation due to income restrictions. This stew was actually created when Hispanics with large families &  limited incomes worked in the Hatch, NM chili fields. Instead of pork or prime cuts of beef, they used hamburger meat though pork shoulder was definitely preferred. [trust me when I say ground cumin & pork go together like helpless women and railroad tracks] Anyway, the more traditional version presents 2 + lbs Hatch Green Chili's, chopped jalape\u00f1os, potatoes, hearty amounts of white onions & celery stalks with leaves, loads of cilantro & cumin, (2 + tbs cumin) parsley, generous amounts of garlic, green/red tomatoes, cayenne and black pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, Mexican Oregeno, bay leaves, Italian seasoning & beef/chicken/vegetable/or pork broth & was always served with warm tortillas. Notice that all ingredients were very easy to come by & cheap for Hispanic workers. If pork was used, they would season flour the meat & brown with garden vegetables then place in pot & simmer until the pork fell apart. This method also made for a thicker stew. Either way, it's a delicious stew & great recipe Michelle!",

The suggestion to drop the cloves and use 1/4 lime and more garlic instead and add some onion worked great -- I wish I had thought to get some cilantro instead of parsley, which would have been even better.

If you like a little heat add some chili powder or jalape\u00f1os. When it's done we fold a flour tortilla in thirds and use it almost like a spoon. Scoop a spoon full on the end and take a bite. I have also torn a flour tortilla over the top of a bowl of this for a less messy way of eating it. Works GREAT in the crockpot if you drain the tomatoes first.",
