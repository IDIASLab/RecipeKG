Some other reviews stated the muffins were dry, mine were very moist and had a tender crumb - surprising for muffins containing so  much cornmeal.  I used home made Greek yogurt,  and duck eggs.  I added some chili flakes, some garlic powder, and less than 1/4 cup of  very finely chopped red onions in addition to the parsley and dill called for.   The batter was very thick, and I was scared they would be dry as a result, so I added approximately 1/4 cup milk, I think that was due to my yogurt being extremely thick, close to being like cream cheese texture.  I sprinkled some shredded strong cheese on top and added a pinch of coarse salt to the tops as well.  Very flavourful with my changes, but I could still see them being delicious without, much more subtle in flavour.  Make sure you spray your muffin cups well as they stuck a bit on the side of the muffins, and mine were done at 18 minutes.",
