We really enjoyed this bread with our morning coffee today!  I love the little bit of sweetness provided by the topping, and I especially appreciate that it's not a crumbly topping that falls off the bread like it does on so many muffins.  I will make this again very soon but with the full size!  We loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I made a double batch yesterday, this time using the whole recipe.  Be careful if you tend, like me, to get carried away with how many nuts and how many blueberries you put in!  While it turned out delicious, I am now busy cleaning out my oven for what overflowed!  I should have used my better sense and noted that when it was going past the 3/4 mark on my pans, I should have changed to a bigger size.  But it still is delicious.",

I thought the addition of the bananas would have enhanced the flavor but instead they it over. I am not sure how to counter the effect.
