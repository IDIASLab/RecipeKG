I did a lemon glaze on some, rolled a few in turbinado sugar before baking, and dusted others with powdered sugar just to change it up a bit. Overall, very good little cookies.",

I have to disagree with anyone who thought they were a little too spongey, a little too lemony, sweet, whatever.  I wouldn't have changed one single thing and my entire family (including my 70-year-old mom and my 2-year-old daughter) kept coming back for more.  Yay!
