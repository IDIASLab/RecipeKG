I placed a good fluffy dollop of cheesecake batter on top of each brownie set the timer for 25 minutes and placed them in the oven. After 25 minutes I checked them with my cake tester and the brownies were still raw. After checking my oven for temperature and trying to figure out why they were not cooking my granddaughter Olivia who is 13 years old figured it out. The directions on the brownie box said to cook brownies for 50 minutes! So please check the cooking time on your brownie mix. I also added an egg to the cheesecake batter and it whipped up nice and fluffy. They were really good! Took one star off for not explaining different cooking times!",
