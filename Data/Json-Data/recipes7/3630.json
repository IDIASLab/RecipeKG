Didn't use a bay leaf because I didn't have any and used eight carrots instead of two and also used one of those little cups of bouillon instead of a cube. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Sea salt and good cracked black peppercorns probably helped too. It was delicious and dipping some locally made bread in the broth was very tasty. It's kind of labor intensive but worth the effort; I'd give it five stars.",
