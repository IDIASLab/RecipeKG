I didn't use food coloring since the batter was bright red but when it baked up it turned brown (like chocolate). I think if I made this again I'd add a little more cocoa powder and call it a chocolate cake. Also how sweet your beets are will determine how sweet the cake is so taste the batter and adjust the sugar accordingly.",
