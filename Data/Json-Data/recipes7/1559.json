My family is Polish though I'd never be able to accurately say this is a Polish recipe.  I could comfortably refer to it as an Old World recipe.\n***  \nPeople certainly saved most everything and pickled many things the average person wouldn't understand or even think appetizing.\n***\nMy Grandmother made these every Summer and they were a big hit and a standard item on the dinner table.   It's certainly an acquired taste and you NEED to let them pickle for a duration of time to get the full taste.  \nMost people try them and are surprised to learn they are watermelon rinds.  They are flavorful, sweet and tangy.\n*** \nThis recipe is rather close to our family's recipe.\n***\nI am pretty sure, my Grandma stuffed the jars with the rinds, cinnamon sticks and the other spices then poured the brine into the jars, then properly followed her typical canning procedure.  As a child, I seem to remember the rinds being raw or blanched (they were firm) when they went into the jars.  I would have to confirm with other family members about this.. but can assure you these rinds were cut in longer 3-4 inch lengths.  \nI don't believe she colored her brine too often, but seem to remember seeing a few green Watermelon Pickles on extended family member's tables.\n***\nThis recipe isn't for everybody.. but for those who enjoy Watermelon Pickles, this would be a great recipe to try!  \nJust don't limit the spices when boi",

When we make them though, we never brine them overnight or pre-boil them in water. Just put the vinegar, spices and rind in a stock pot and boil until translucent, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Then put in about six pint jars and seal. This a lot faster and easier.",

I increased  the cider vinger to 2 quarts & the suger to 3 cups, also over mesured the spices slighty. Tasted just like the first batch!!! Note: My Husband used the discarded spice bag in his garage for a week! What a wonderful smell! ",
