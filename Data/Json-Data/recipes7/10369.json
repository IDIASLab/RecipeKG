Best served over a good steak and really good on asparagus too! Or can be used instead of hollandaise on eggs Benedict. To keep warm, keep it in double boiler over hot water (removed from heat) until ready to serve.",

Was looking wonderful like i said for about two minutes turned from the stove to get a Ice Water maybe 15 seconds and the Sauce was just plain ingredients not together at all... Thinking I should of used a binding agent such as Corn Starch and possibly less Butter? Not real sure but will try again.",

I thought the rice vinegar would be weird but it was very good. I used onion instead of shallot because that is what I had on hand. It's winter so I've been forced to buy store bought eggs but cannot wait to try this again the Spring when my chickens start laying eggs again. This was so good that I plan on using up the leftovers on my t-bone steak today.",
