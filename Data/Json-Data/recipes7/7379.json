My grandmother stresses that you shouldn't leave them unrefrigerated for more than four or five hours, or they may not keep. She says it's easy and very good! My grandmother rotates the can by turning it upside down every other day, then back over. Within about a week, the pickles will be sweet and delicious!",

To make sure the sugar dissolved, I drained the pickles into a measuring cup then put them back in the jar. I dissolved the sugar and juice in a sauce pan and cooked it like a simple syrup. I cooled it and poured it over the pickles in the jar and added Apple cider vinegar to cover. I took 2 jars to a picnic 8 days later. I had two plastic storage bowls, one slightly smaller, and had put water halfway up the larger and floated the smaller and set that in the freezer. I drained the pickles and put them in the smaller so they had an ice base at the picnic with Toothpicks handy. They were gone. Note, the frozen bowl sweated with condensation so I should have put something absorbent under it like napkins or tea towel.",
