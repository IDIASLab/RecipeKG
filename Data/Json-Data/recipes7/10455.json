The amount of buttermilk to dry is nearly equal and when you add in the pumpkin it makes the batter entirely too wet. This prevented the pancakes from fluffing up and developing a good substantial texture. To make this recipe work I would recommend reducing the buttermilk to around half a cup. I will say that the flavor overall was good.",
