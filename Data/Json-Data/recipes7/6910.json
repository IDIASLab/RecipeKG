I grated one average sized zucchini and it came to a bit less than 2 cups. My container of lemon yogurt was only 6 oz so I added another 2 oz of plain greek yogurt. I will try making these next time using applesauce and oil beaten with the egg instead of the butter. I am glad I made these. Thanks for a nice easy recipe. UPDATE: I meant to say that these don't rise really high so don't be afraid to fill your muffin cups - there was some batter left over after making 12 regular muffins.",

Baked at 365F for 20 min. I also skipped the glaze to keep them sugar-free. They browed easily but I found the middle to be a bit too wet. Next I will try reducing yoghurt and apple sauce to 5 tbsp each and baking at 350F for 35 min.",
