I finally settled on this one, because who wouldn't want the healthier version? Anyway, I did make a couple of alterations to make it even healthier by using organic pure cane sugar instead of white sugar, egg replacer, and earth balance instead of butter. I was nervous that it wouldn't bake properly, especially with the egg replacer, but everything came out delicious and creamy thanks to the sour cream. \n\nThis recipe also makes a ton of bread. I ended up making 4 mini loaves (~5x3 in disposable pans) AND about 20 muffins. The loaves took about 1 hr 10 mins to bake and the muffins took just about 40-45 minutes. All in all, I will definitely come back to this recipe when I have some end-of-road bananas that need using. RECOMMENDED!",

Oh I didn't add in any nuts. They still turned out good! I plan on making these again with the 3 whole bananas and I will edit my review.
