These new cups were the half size of a typical tea cup of that time. It could hold 2-3 fl. oz. / 60-90 ml of liquid. They have a height of 2-2.5 in. / 5-6 cm. They were accompanied by saucers (\u201ccoffee stands\u201d) which had a diameter of 4-4.5 in. / 10-12 cm.''\n\nFor one fincan, you put 2 teaspoons of the coffee. \nif you want to have low-sugar coffee: you need half of the cube sugar.\nif you want to have medium-sugar coffee: you need 1 cube sugar.\nif you want more sugary: you need max 2 cube sugar. \nor you don't even need to add sugar at all, it's your choice.\n\nbut as an advise; the more sugar, the less taste of the coffee.\n\nSo this is how it goes:\n\n1. take your cezve and put 2 teaspoons of coffee. if you are 2 person then you'll need 4 teaspoons of coffee.\n\n2. if you want, add your sugar. Max 2 sugar is also enough for 2 person if you want to drink sugary. \n\n3. then  take your -fincan- and fill with water (not milk). if you are 2 person so you need 2 fincans of water in the -cezve-.\n\n4. before taking -cezve- to the heat, you should mix all together and for 35 seconds. \n\n5. take the cezve with the mixture to the low heat and continiue to stir. make sure you stir nice and slow. stir until it bubble ups.\n\n6. then take the coffee from ",
