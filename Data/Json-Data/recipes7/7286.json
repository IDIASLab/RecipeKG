I definitely would add more to the filling if nothing more than some small pieces of berries blueberries bananas a little cream cheese whatever. There must be some technique involved in folding the crepe into a letter because that was a little tedious for me. In the future I d probably just fold or roll like an ordinary crepe. ravera thanks for sharing a recipe that you used to have in your hostel.",
