Popped in the over to heat filling and finish browning the shells and served right away. I had one left over and just put it in a ziploc and left it at room temp overnight. Put it in the over for about 5 min to reheat. I made one without berries for a picky eater and it was also great. I love berries but I would also like to try this with other fruit. Because of the cinnamon chopped apples would be delicious in place of the berries.",

I used frozen berries and that was a mistake that caused the pastry filling to be very runny, so I definitely don't recommend frozen berries in this recipe.

There is way too much filling when you do it this way but it's very tasty so I'll use it as a fruit dip. I overfilled them a bit but it all turned out just fine. Since my rectangles were so small one blackberry per pastry was about all I could get in there. I folded over into little triangles. I don't have turbinado sugar which is made from sugar cane extract and is crystallized. Brown sugar is an accepted substitute though so I used that. They turned out just lovely--my only problem is going to be how to stop eating these things!!! Thanks for the recipe!",
