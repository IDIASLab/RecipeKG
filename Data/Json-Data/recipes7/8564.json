Keep that whisk going to insure proper whisking. I had to turn my heating element down some in the process. However I couldn't find whole cashews so I just used what I could find at the store. I could have done with more cranberries though. Everyone that tried it liked it a lot. Will make again;-) but decreasing the vanilla just a tad.",

Follow the recipe to a T (boil 5 minutes) and it comes out perfect every single time. I recently read another fudge-maker's review that said not to stir the fudge during the boiling at all. I tried it and it did seem to make it silkier. Yum!",
