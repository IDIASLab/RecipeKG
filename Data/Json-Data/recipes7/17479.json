Next time I will add some cumin too. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you for the recipe!",

The soup (according to the video) is quite thin but the flavor - WOW!! By spicy it means you get warmth from the ginger and curry powder but it s hard to pinpoint exactly what is making it so delicious. I d like to add more squash or a potato next time to make it thicker but this is seriously addictive and so tasty. Made on a snowy day = perfect savory sip.",

I wanted a really thick soup but five cups of broth even with almost three pounds of squash made it rather soupy. I went easy on the sugar. I kept the other ingredients the same. I also added two carrots one apple and fresh ginger not grated. I added a pinch of nutmeg cinnamon cardamon and allspice Instead of heavy cream I used coconut milk. Cooked it for 12 minutes and natural release for 10 minutes. It was easy to make because you're going to use a hand blender so everything can be rough cut.",
