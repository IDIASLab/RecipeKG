I baked it in a Nordic Ware Heritage Bundt pan for 1 hour.  The next time I bake it, I plan on adding almond extract and maybe a light chocolate glaze. The cinnamon was very faint. We love chocolate and cherries and combined together, they made a very moist cake. It is a keeper for me! Thanks for sharing!",
