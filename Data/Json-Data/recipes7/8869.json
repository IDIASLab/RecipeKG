(My son wanted Costco style muffins, so we skipped the lemon.)\n\nBut the muffins were great, a perfect cross of cake-meets-muffin. Not heavy and thick like Costco (which is more like a quick bread in a muffin shape). Definitely a make-again recipe. Not sure why you have to whip the eggs (fluffier muffins?), but it made for a beautiful batter, along with the buttermilk, which added a lovely flavor (we used low-fat because it came in a smaller container). YUM!",
