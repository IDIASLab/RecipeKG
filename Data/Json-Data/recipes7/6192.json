Go here: http://allrecipes.com/help/Feedback.aspx Now for my review, as per the authors suggestion I used the 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 cup bwn sugar and 1 Tbsp juice. I did add the sugar and juice to the butter in the pan and melted it till it bubbled then I poured it in my 9\" round pan. I also use the \" Homemade Biscuit Mix\" recipe found here on Allrecipes. This is a simple and delicious recipe, thank you Kaye Lynn!",

I wish I would have read the submitters review on this about making it sweeter or changing up the topping. I am one to think that most desserts are too sweet however the cake part didn't hardly seem sweet at all. When first done it was very soft but by the next day the cake was kind of doughy. I had thought the topping should have been a little more prominent too. Only change I made was using a homemade bisquick type mix. I have used it in many recipes calling for it with great results. I would follow the reviewers advice about increasing the butter and brown sugar and definitely add the nuts it might add something to the flavor and texture.",
