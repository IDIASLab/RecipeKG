Also, I couldn't find a gingerbread cake mix so I used a spice cake, and added ground ginger and molasses to it and it tasted just like gingerbread. I also made a praline and crumbled it-anyone that wanted it added some on top of thier trifle. Don't add it before or it won't be crunchy! It was a great addition with a bit of crunch. Definitely will make this one again!",
