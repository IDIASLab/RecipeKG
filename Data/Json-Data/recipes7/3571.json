This barquillo taste better than the one I buy from the store it is light and melts in your mouth. I even stuffed it with whipped cream. Since it is delicate I only put 6 in the tray so that I do not have to rush rolling it. After baking I place it on a cloth napkin where I will roll it and used the napkin to help me to roll. I put it on the kitchen towel with the overlapped edge down just in case it unrolls. I baked it on silpat liner. The only problem I have was spreading it on the tray with my offset spatula. I will use this recipe again",
