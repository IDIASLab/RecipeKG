Occasionally the excess water from the squash would pool in the pans so I drained them once or twice during baking and I really think this helped cut down on the mushiness. They are softer than french fries but mine were not really mushy. Delicious!! My kids liked these as well as the adults at my dinner tonight. I will make these again for sure.",

I've been doing \"faux fries\" for awhile and have found that the best way to get that crispiness you are looking for is to first toss them in a small amount of evoo cook them a little shorter time than called for then broil them for the last 3-5 minutes. You'll have to experiment with the thickness you cut the time you cook and your own oven temps but a few times and you should find the right mix so that they come out soft on the inside and crispy out. I move alot so I have to play with the mix with each new oven. Don't put too much oil on it won't help! Also don't crowd the pan or everything ends up getting steamed instead of \"faux fried\". Hope this helps!",
