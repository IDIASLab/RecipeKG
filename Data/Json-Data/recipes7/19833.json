Only suggestion would be to use a good-quality cocoa because that s what you re really going to taste here. Silky creamy smooth rich even made with skim milk (what was on hand). Just not quite as thick as I'd have liked so I'll add a bit more cornstarch the next time. Thanks for sharing your nana s recipe.",
