Set the timer for 35 minutes ( somewhere in middle of 30-40 minutes as per recipe) but I bet they only needed 20-25 minutes. They are definitely more like muffins than cupcakes and I didn't care for the olive oil taste. Could be because I have very good olive oil and it really came through but still if I did make them again I would try coconut oil. Coconut and banana is a good combo though!",
