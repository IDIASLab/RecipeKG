I used 1/4 cup of sugar and the filling was quite sweet enough. Also used all half and half instead of a combo of heavy cream and milk. The filling is creamy and delicious, but mine were over done at 15mins. 13mins might have been fine. Next time, I might just bake the puff pastry shells first, let cool, then pour in the filling and bake till the filling is done. Otherwise, the tart shells didn't brown very much.",

I used a roll of pillsbury pie crust cut into tart size circles, I got about six crusts out of one roll.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla instead of just three drops.  The filling only made enough for six tarts for me, but that's okay, it probably would have made more had I used jumbo sized eggs.  I baked them for a full 20 minutes and they were great!  My fiance said they were just like the ones from Hong Kong!",
