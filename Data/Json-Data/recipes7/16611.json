But he fell head over heels for these.  \nHe made his mommie take some of the leftovers home.  But i had to split it up between both of the families.  I should say I made enough for two 9x13 pans.  I know the children would love it.  So I made extra.\nIf it were offered I would give these brownies a 5 1/2, I believe the little one would agree.  Thank for sharing.",
