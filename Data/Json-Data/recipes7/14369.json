I thought that there would not be enough leavening in this cake (with only a 1 tsp baking powder and a 1/4 tsp baking soda and not using real eggs) and I was right. This cake barely rose at all thus not only making it dense but also not allowing it to cook properly. I had to cook it at least 20-30 extra minutes and it still wasn't fully done the center. I think adding in at least 1 1/2 tsps EACH of baking soda and baking powder might help and maybe using real eggs as well. The whole wheat flour the zucchini and the blueberries all weigh a cake down so extra leavening (especially in the absence of any kind of fat) is necessary. The taste is pretty good but overall I will probably not make this again.",
