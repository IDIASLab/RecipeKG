Didn't have any amaretto so I used 2 Tbsp of Vin Santo and a few drops of bitter almond extract. It has a delicate texture and sweet taste.  I baked it in a 9-inch porcelain tart dish and it was baked throughout in 23 minutes.  The lack of baking powder doesn't make it heavy by any means.  This recipe renders a light and delicate cake perfect for a mid-afternoon snack with light tea.  Thank you for sharing.",
