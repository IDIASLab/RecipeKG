I followed the recipe omited nuts baked in a glass 10x13 for 53 min and was glad I checked it when I did. It would have been dry if left for the full hour. The cake is moist light and so full of healthy fiber! I did end up doubling the frosting recipe. It didn't look like enough and I really love cream cheese frosting;) Next time I'll add more spices to get a spicier cake. I'd also like to try some golden raisins!",

One note - next time I would probably add a teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the baking soda to give it a bit more lift. The taste was perfect as written. Enjoy!",
