Few things to note: add a splash of vanilla, wayy less salt (i added a pinch and that was fine), pancakes were a little on the dense side so maybe a little more baking powder than recipe called for but it didn\u2019t bother me too much. But overall recipe was great. Anything that went wrong was user error on my part (which was just having the heat too high so watch out for that)",
