I also baked it in a 9x9 square pan instead of a 9x13...it seemed much too thin to spread evenly in the larger pan, and I like my baked oatmeal to be a little heartier and thicker. This recipe was great, as I felt like it was healthier than others I've seen that call for 3 times the sugar and butter.  It didn't lack in taste though - was delicious with a cold glass of milk (and didn't taste like I was eating dessert for breakfast).  Hubby and I will eat on this for the rest of the week - thanks so much!",
