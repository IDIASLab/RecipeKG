Everyone could benefit from bookmarking this recipe and using its techniques for tender cakes. The texture of this cake was phenomenal, not as dense as typical pound cake. I would call this a \"cocoa cake\", though, because the ONLY change I made was to add twice the amount of cocoa, and it still wasn't very chocolatey. Chocolate ganache from this site topped it well. I wonder what substituting melted bittersweet chocolate for cocoa (2-4 squares) and cream cheese for sour cream would do. At least, DO add more chocolate chips!- 2 cups if you really like chocolate; just don't refrigerate it, or the chips will be hard. I'm savin' this recipe =)",

I'm normally one to take shortcuts and rush through a recipe (as I have two young children) but I really took my time both times I made this cake...following every step.

I had been looking for a yummy chocolate chip cake to satisfy my craving for choco chips without resorting to cookies. Most cakes I found used ingredients like packaged jell-o pudding. I always prefer to take things from more basic ingredients- so I know exactly what is going in my food and so I feel like I am actually baking! So this recipe was great! We have a large oven and a smaller oven for side dishes and rolls and such. I used my smaller oven so the result was shorter cooking time and a crust that was not too hard but a little crispy. The inside is still moist and creamy melt-in-your-mouth good. It is just great! Thanks for this recipe I will be using it again!",
