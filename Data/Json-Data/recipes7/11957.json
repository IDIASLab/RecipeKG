First of all calling for 2\" cupcake liners is blatantly wrong - they are far too big for the wafer cookies - and the standard mini size are too small. If you're going to make this get the 1.75 size (harder to find). Secondly the cheesecake itself tastes good but the texture of the vanilla wafer is blah. - really hurts the overall. Thirdly the caramel taste does not come through well in the mix. I'm going to try other versions before resorting to this one again",

One bag was enough for 4 inside and 3 on top. I guess I'll just have to make another batch in the future!!",
