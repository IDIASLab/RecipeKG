I live in Boulder and my baking has all but disappeared due to issues with hgh altitude but I 'm giving it another go. Wish me luck! Oh and this is a yellow cake not white.

I added a 1/4 tsp. of almond extract. The flavor of the cake is decent. I also paired it with allrecipes.com recipe for wedding cake icing. That recipe is terrific and it is great on this cake. This cake is pretty white though not pure white. It is not yellow. To make it whiter one could use clear imitation vanilla extract.",
