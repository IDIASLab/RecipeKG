                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe with modifications to make it more multi-grain. To make up the total amount of flour I used small amounts of rye flour quinoa flour oat bran corn meal then a generous amount of whole wheat flour and a lot less unbleached white flour. I used the called-for amounts of other ingredients. To be healthier I used safflower oil. When I made the mix using one cup of dry mix one cup of milk (I used soy milk) plus the egg and 2 T oil I found it a little too wet. No problem! I just added a little more mix. The pancakes were delicious fluffy and exactly what I hoped for. Next time I'll try substituting applesauce or other pureed fruit butter for the oil. I've used apple butter or pureed prunes with good success. Another favorite substitute for me: instead of an egg I use 1 T ground flax seed with 3 T water whip briskly for several minutes until really thick and viscous. It works great as an \"egg\" and hasn't ruined any recipes for me yet. I think in future I'll make this with whatever flours I have available and maybe even substitute a scoop of protein powder (shake mix) for some of the flour to make up the total. It is fun to experiment! And it always always comes out great. The only caveat: I do find that I can't make waffles well without some oil. For pancakes this could work with less oil but waffles need this amount.",
