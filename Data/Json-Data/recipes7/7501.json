I ran out of bowls and pans to hold all of the food!\n\nTasty, esp. with more ginger.  Would suggest less cabbage and more other veggies, to give it more balance.  I thought the soy made it a bit salty, but it mellowed out a bit after a day.  Made it with chicken instead of Spam (I know it's popular in the Pacific, but it's still processed mystery meat).  \n\nAs memory serves, this is pretty close to the Tofu Chanpuru you get in Okinawa in Okinawan restaurants, but they have more balance of veggies.  Will be making this again!",
