I was reluctant to use \u201cstore bought\u201d sauce but I can\u2019t imagine home made could have made this dish  any better. I used an organic basil pasta sauce,  without added junk,  from Aldi. Had to use bacon because pancetta wasn\u2019t to be found. Added the red pepper flakes after the bacon was browned the Italian way. .  Also used a clove  of minced garlic rather than powdered that I saut\u00e9ed with the eggplant.  I will definitely be making this over and over!!",
