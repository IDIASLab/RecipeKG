I didn't use mastic, but glad it was optional, and did not have the traditional red-dyed eggs made, also optional. I swapped the sliced almonds with crushed walnuts and the topping still made a wonderfully beautiful loaf. Also included dried berries in the mix for some extra sweetness. Super delicious and wonderful! Thank you!",
