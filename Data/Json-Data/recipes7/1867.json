I think that would be so yummy.' So, I bought some eggnog and set about finding out if it is possible, and it is. You can also take the same recipe and pour it into a prepared pie crust for an eggnog custard pie. It's a lot less work and hassle than individual ramekins.",

I baked the filling in a deep dish regular pastry pie crust in a water bath until firm approximately 55 minutes. Just awesome - great rich eggnog flavor with a firm creamy texture from the marscapone. Since there was no burnt sugar on top I would compare this more to a custard than a creme brulee. I will definitely make again as custard or pie. Yummy!!",
