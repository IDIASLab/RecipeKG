It was worth it. They were fluffy, not dry, and delicious. Slightly 'crisp' on the outside and moist on the inside. Tasted like they were from a bakery and not from a box. I did make a few substitutions but I don't think it effected it. I did not have self rising flour and used regular white flour but added 1 tsp baking powder for every cup of flour plus added an additional half tsp of salt. I also did not have lemons but used lemon juice (store bought) and halved the amount for the zest. This review is for the cupcake as I had left over frosting and so used that. ",

They are slightly dense, but I think that is typical of baked goods made from scratch.  The 2nd time I made them I added a bit more lemon juice, and my husband said they were even better.  Don't worry if you don't have the self-rising flour - adding a tsp of baking powder for each cup of flour works just fine.  And I loved the lemony whipped cream frosting.  Terrific!

It has that wonderful richness only butter can contribute and just the right level of fresh citrus flavor (I used lime rather than lemon).  I did take the plunge and buy self-rising flour for these, as my understanding is the protein content is different \u2013 much closer to cake flour than all purpose. In other words, just adding leaveners  to all purpose flour supposedly won\u2019t duplicate it exactly even tho\u2019 it's an acceptable substitute.   I frosted these with Easy Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site, to which I added a tablespoon of grated lime zest.   This cake and that frosting?  The perfect combo.",
