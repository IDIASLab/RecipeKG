I recommend halving this recipe unless you have enough counter space for 40 LARGE rolls. Once they rise, they look like individual bread loaves. Now the forgiving.  Even though I had to go to the store to get more flour, and wait through a power outage, these turned out perfect.  A little firm on the outside, nice and soft inside with a great mild salty flavor. I'll make these a lot.  I didn't change anything, but I think if I lived somewhere with saltwater that would be great to try!",

I'd prefer to make them a little smaller than I did. I found that spraying cooking spray on my hands helped keep the dough from sticking when I shaped it into balls. Can't wait to try it again.",

I followed the measuring instructions of another reviewer who scaled it down as well turned out fabulous. The only thing I did different was that I used butter in the place of shortening. I added a little more melted butter than the scaled down recipe originally called for (instead of 1/4 cup I used about a 1/2 cup). Very easy to make if you are willing to take the time - well worth all the effort it takes! I baked them exactly 20 mins and as soon as I took them out of the oven I brushed the tops of them with melted butter - amazing!!!",
