I also used a 1.6 oz package of sugar free vanilla pudding in place of the regular and they were unbelievably good! However as another reviewer remarked chewy softness was lost a bit with the applesauce. So along with the applesauce I added 1/3 c ripe room temperature avocado. This added back some fat--but the heart healthy mono/poly-unsaturated kind--which achieved that rich melt-all-your-cares-away softens. My family had no idea--even my 7 and 4 yr old sons said they were the best cookies I'd ever made;)",
