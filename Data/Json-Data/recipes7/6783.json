I think it would have been just fine with the 3/4 cup. We also didn't have any bourbon and didn't want to use the vodka in it so we used two tablespoons of coffee. Great great recipe! I also used Best-Ever Pie Crust from this site. Nice. And we got 12 slices out of this pie because it was very rich. Great with ice cream or whipped cream.",

Another review tipped me off that 1 hour to roast pecans was too long so I looked elsewhere for instructions which recommended roasting at 350 for 8-15 minutes. Mine were done after 10. Even after baking for 60 minutes the pie was goopy and uncooked in the center although I must edit this review to say that it did set up a bit as it cooled though not 100%. All of the chocolate chips settled to the bottom even though I used the mini chips as directed. I would try not melting the butter next time and just softening it. I would highly recommend using a deep dish pan if you bake this pie - I didn't have one and paid the price (my fault not the recipe). It spilled over the edges and caused part of the crust to fall off.",
