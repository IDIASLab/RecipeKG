As a child, I usually asked for this pie instead of cake for my birthday. Since the rhubarb is cooked down into a slightly chunky custard filling, this recipe does not require tender springtime rhubarb and can be made whenever rhubarb is available (even frozen).",

I've been searching for a recipe for this for four years but no one I know had heard of it. This is a delicious mixture of tart and sweet and I, like you, prefer the rhubarb cooked down into the custard instead of rhubarb chunks. So having said that, I did cook the rhubarb longer than you state and mashed it before incorporating the cream mixture in. Other than that, I made no changes and don't plan on any. This is a great recipe for a great pie. \nPS: I love surprising dinner guests with this dessert. I like to bring the pie to the table and I know they are expecting lemon meringue pie. I can't wait to see their faces when I cut a slice and it is pink!",
