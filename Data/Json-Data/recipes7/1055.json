The only thing I would like to advice you is that instead of making 12 big conchas (on a 12 portions recipe) make the balls or conchas smaller around 20, they are easier to handle and the crust seems to hold better than in the bigger ones. I had a blast making them and the crust was so easy to decorate. In mexico usually we make not just the shells all kinds of decorations use your imagination...Thanks again for the recipe...they are delicious!!!!!",

I did let it rest for 10 minutes before rolling into balls. After reading reviews I decided to use 3 teaspoons of yeast and for those of you who don't know how to measure 3/8 cup of sugar, I googled it and it said use 1/2 cup minus 2 tablespoons. I did take the advice from a review that said to heat the milk, which I did for about 20 seconds. Please watchful of the time!! I did 15 minutes and it was starting to over cook I think 12-13 mins will work. It was cooked all the way threw also. Will make again thank you for sharing",

They were a huge hit and are so delicious!!\n\nfor those having a problem with the density of the dough...I actually did them overnight.  I made the dough and rolled with the topping the night before. While making the dough let the yeast bloom in the warm water first for 10minutes or until foamy. Then proceed with recipe.  Proof to double in a warm place (very important).  Roll and top with topping and place rolls on a baking sheet.  Then in the morning set the oven at 200 degrees with a bowl of water at the bottom.  Turned off the oven, add the rolls and let the breads proof to double.  Remove from the oven and preheat to 375 degrees.  Bake as directed.  They weren't dense at all and were light and yummy.",

The first time I tried the recipe the dough wouldn't rise.  It also needed to included temperature of liquid.  I warmed the milk a little so that the yeast could bloom.  I had to add a little extra milk.  I think if one really knows the science behind bread and yeast it could be a great recipe but for someone that has little to no experience with yeast breads it could be a waste of time and money.",
