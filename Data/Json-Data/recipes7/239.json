I stumbled upon this recipe and I must admit I was skeptical when I read it. Then after reading the first few reviews I decided to give it a try. wow!! am I glad I did! They are AWESOME! they really taste like donuts. I did stray from the recipe slightly cooking mine between 325 & 350 as they seemed to be cooking too fast on the outside at 375. I then put some white sugar in a bag and gave them a shake when they were done. Of course I couldn't stop at one...I've already eaten 3 and poured a big glass of milk. If you follow the directions you will not be disappointed with this recipe!",

Also instead of dipping the bread into the batter try using a spoon to pour it over the 1/4's and then turn to cover the other side. Allow the excess the drip off before placing in hot oil. Happy eating:)",
