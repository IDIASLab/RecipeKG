There are a few tips that help: Either go easy on maple syrup or skip it. If the berries are quite ripe skip the syrup. You shouldn't need the liquid from the syrup if the berries are ripe. Also don't be shy with the berries she would often but in 5 or more cups. Sometimes Mrs Hadsell would put in almond extract or cocnut extract instead of the vanilla. She almost always added a few dabs of butter on top of the berries. The key is ripe and full sized blackberries. The rest takes care of itself.",

When I made the recipe I pureed 1 cup of the berries very well and sieved them into a pan with the 1 cup sugar the spices and 4 Tb. cornstarch cooking until thick and bubbly. Cool slightly and mix with the remaining ingredients to put in pie shell. I'm sure tapioca would also work in this recipe. The flavorings are a good combination. Another time (since we have a lot of large and juicy wild blackberries) we added part of a can of pre-made apple pie filling not having quite enough blackberries to make up the recipe. That also works with these flavors.",

But when I cut into it after letting it cool for about two hours the inside was totally soupy - not gooey but quite liquid. I guess that thing about lacking thickeners (as a previous reviewer mentioned) was the problem here. The crust I used was a store-bought refrigerated one not from scratch. I'm not very familiar with blackberries but they looked nice and plump and ripe to me. I cut 6 slits in the top of the pie (does making \"holes\" as specified in the recipe really make a difference i.e. better venting?) and baked it for 50 minutes. I will mention that I live at a high elevation (around 6200 feet) but I wouldn't think that would make much difference either. On the other hand the taste per se was pretty good and when I drained most of the liquid out after having the first half of the \"pie\" the remaining pie slices were a lot more like what I expected although they were pretty flat. A hard lesson to learn - I'll know better next time - but this recipe just didn't work for me as is.",
