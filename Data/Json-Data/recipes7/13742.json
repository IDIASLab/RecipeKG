These are a nice addition to breakfast/brunch/lunch, as a side with dinner (poultry or fish would be a good companion), or for a snack. They're pretty good for entertaining if you want to make more than one batch at a time.",

                "reviewBody": "These scones are excellent. I followed the recipe except that I had no soy milk so used 2% and used Gruyere cheese instead of Parmesan as the recipe submitted suggested. The scones taste just a little bit flat - so the next time I make them I'll increase the sugar to 1/4c and increase the salt by 1/4 tsp. Instructions say to cut the dough in 8ths but there is quite a bit of dough so I cut it into 12 wedges and they are still a good size. Thank you to the recipe submitter - I'll make these often. The house smelled divine while they were baking. Update: these are not so pleasant the day after. There is a bitterness that over-rides everything so plan to eat them while they are fresh.",
