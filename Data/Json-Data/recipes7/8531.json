When eating a spoon of confectioners sugar is put on your plate and the donut is dunked into the sugar before each bite! (No calories there lol). My recipe is very similar to this except I add a tbsp of sour cream... my dear Mom-in-law s Recipe... Two years ago I added cinnamon o the flour and small pieces of chopped apple and everyone loved them as they tasted better than a dutchie donut!! Great recipe!",
