If you aren't familiar with young coconuts search youtube for \"how to open a young coconut.\"  Not only is it interesting to watch but important to know how to open them correctly without injuring yourself or spilling the coconut water.  I use a simple chef's knife to open them.  Back to the recipe, I chopped the fresh coconut in the food processor to get the pieces uniform. Mine took longer to cook but I think it's because I didn't use hot water in the water bath which I will definitely do next time.  This dish does not taste too eggy, too coconutty, or too sweet.  It's a perfect balance of flavors.  Very easy to make.  I will make this dish often.  Thank you for a great recipe!",
