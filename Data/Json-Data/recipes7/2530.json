I took the recipe with me to the farmers market to get all of the ingredients and I lost the recipe in the store. I came on here to find a recipe that was similar to the one she gave me and this one most resembled the one I lost. This recipe was excellent. I added some coconut flakes and used real ginger because I had no ground ginger and it was great. This is a great recipe it wont let you down.  P.S. If you have zucchini that has a lot of water be sure to squeeze the water out of it before adding it.",

Most important I m disappointed with the loaf itself. While I should have known better than to continue on when the batter filled only about one-third of the pan I should also have been able to rely on the pan size called for in the recipe. I want a loaf not thick bars baked in a loaf pan. This was barely two inches tall! A word to the wise either make a full recipe and make one 9x5 loaf or use smaller pans. Or make muffins. Or since this bread was rather non-descript choose one of the many better zucchini bread recipes on this site. (And don t make the same mistake I did whatever size pan you choose to use the pan should be 2/3 full with batter!) Note: If you still decide to try this recipe add a teaspoon of salt.",

I figured all that juicy goodness was just going to make the bread all that much better. The addition of the dates also adds moistness (and body) to the bread. The black pepper is BRILLIANT! Can't really tell it is there but there is a \"little something\" that makes it different. I made a second batch and used freshly grated ginger (quite a lot actually) and that really pushed the flavors over the edge. You can make this batter into large loafs mini loafs or muffins. You could probably even do it as a cake (ala Carrot Cake) just fill whatever pans you are using 2/3 full and adjust the baking time accordingly. A keeper recipe for sure.",
