I baked it last night, rolled up the sponge, unrolled it within about 90 minutes, filled it and then let it sit in the refrigerator (covered) overnight. This morning I covered it in whipped cream and garnished it with halved strawberries cut into hearts. And then we ate the entire thing ...soooo good! It does keep, but it tastes best right then and there!",
