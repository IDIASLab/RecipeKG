It's been a big hit at every holiday gathering. I never really liked cranberry sauce before but I was asked to bring some to a family gathering found this recipe and it is so good. I let the cranberries cook a little longer and I find it helps it to thicken a bit more. Let it set in the fridge over night and the consistency is perfect.",
