I admit I was worried at the 4 hour mark by how tough the rump roast was when  I took it out to slice it diagonally , but it was falling apart at 6 hours. Plus,  I had never carmelized onions before but it was really worth the effort .  Toasting the buttered rolls before adding the cheese and then putting them under the broiler gave the rolls the heft necessary to stay in one piece when dipped in the soup.  My husband requested this recipe after he saw it in an email from All Recipes.  I was initially  reluctant because I don't  like lots of sliced onions in recipes but caramelizing the onions made all the difference.  I wanted to eat them with a spoon! My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I used 14 oz of beef broth and 6 oz of chicken broth because I did not have any more beef broth.  It came out fine with that substitution. This recipe is a keeper!",
