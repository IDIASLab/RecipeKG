While plain yogurt is something I never buy sour cream is something I always have on hand so I subtstituted that for the yogurt. The batter reminds me of how you'd mix up pancakes and is very light airy and fluffy just like the finished cake. I baked this in two (3-cup capacity) Bundt pans and it was just the perfect amount of batter. The vegetable oil makes it a very moist cake and the glaze soaks in to make it even more so. I was afraid two tablespoons of lemon zest might be overkill but it wasn't at all. I was also a little concerned that the limoncello might make this a little boozy tasting especially in the glaze but it wasn't an issue. The combination of the zest fresh lemon juice and limoncello makes this one refreshingly lemony cake. Delicious on its own and even better with berries or fresh whipped cream - followed by a little sip or two of ice cold limoncello!",

Moist and very flavorful. Followed the recipe (except baked in mini bundt pans) and then drizzled lemon curd (Microwave Lemon Curd recipe from this site) over it, added a little whipped cream and then tossed a couple of Candied Lemon Peels (also from AR) on just for fun. Lemon, Lemon and more Lemon!  We loved it and it was fun making this dessert. I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!",

We included the pinch of salt, less zest (only had one lemon), a tad more lemon juice, a touch more powdered sugar and instead of Limoncello we used some leftover lemon-lime flavoured wine beverage (as per my mom's recommendation). Great to serve to guests with tea, or to complement an Italian or slightly heavy dinner as the cake is very airy and light. Easy, and I'm definitely going to make this again.",
