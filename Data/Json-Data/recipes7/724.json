They're kind of sweet and kind of sour, but absolutely wonderful!  You can also substitute 6 ounces of cream cheese for the sour cream if that's what you have on hand, in which case you should bake the dish covered. These chops are great served with rice pilaf, mashed potatoes, or over pasta, with a salad on the side. Enjoy!",

It must be the sour cream mix that protects the pork chops. It does develop a \"skin\" on the sour cream but it still tastes fine. I used ground savory bc I don't have dried summer savory and I added a bit of garlic powder. I also added some corn starch to the mix while heating it in the pan so as to get a thicker sauce. It turned out well. It is kind of sweet and sour--not really like sweet and sour sauce but it does faintly remind me of it. I do like it even if it didn't result in the most beautiful pic I've ever taken. Thanks for the recipe!",

The main ingredient missing in the recipe is salt. I salted the pork chops before coating them with flour. And add a tablespoon salt while cooking the sour cream mixture. With the amount of pork chops 4 that the recipe calls for you will for sure get the watery sauce at the end. So add 2 more chops and whisk in about 1 tablespoon flour left from coating the chops. If you really don't want the chop to taste sweet cut the sugar in half.
