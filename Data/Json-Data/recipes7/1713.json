Fudgy and not dry thanks again! update= I had to leave town the next day so I was forced to freeze them best thing is they are better now! Something about freezing them helped take away the little bit of grittiness there was. If you work with gluten free products you know what I mean. So try freezing them when you have any leftovers so you really can enjoy later. I made a peanut butter frosting to go on top yummy!",

I added enough liquid until it was of similar consistency to a non GF box mix. Thanks for sharing. I will make this again.",
