Except for using White WW Flour instead of all-purpose (we are a non white flour house!).:) These were excellent - good flavor from the cardamom just sweet enough and very tender. However I do have a problem with the making of the bread. I am going to try this again using more traditional techniques (proofing the yeast kneading before the 1st rise). Reason - it didn't rise AT ALL during the 1st rise.... I mean at all. Now this could be partly because my water mixture was barely at 100 degrees (it cooled really fast!) I like to have mine at 110. So! I will try this again and see how it goes. Def worth trying!!",

Mix 3 cups of flour with the yeast then add the liquid (up to 120 deg. F) and the eggs. Mix to create a runny dough. Then slowly add the rest of the flour and knead 8-10 min. to form a soft sticky dough (I do all this in my KitchenAid.) Then put in fridge overnight - cover top loosely with non-stick foil. Then continue with the rest of the recipe. The formed rolls will take longer than an hour to rise because they were formed from cold dough so be patient. Whew!",

And in fact that is what my coworkers did. I have to say though that I'm not pleased with how they rise separately on a cookie sheet. These are more workable as pull apart rolls in my opinion. They rise outward and so when I tried on the cookie sheet I ended up with flat little disks so I reshaped and placed in a pan then let them rise again. Although this made for some funny looking rolls (I don't do consistently sized rolls well) this worked much better. Takes a lot longer to bake though but I liked how they rose better. I couldn't fit all the rolls in the pan so I played around and made five braided rolls placed them together in a bread pan then let rise and baked along with the pan. It turned out really well actually and made for a small but tasty and pretty loaf. I might do that next time again. Thanks for the recipe!",
