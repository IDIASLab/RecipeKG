However I came across this recipe and decided it looked too Strawberrylicious to pass up. I cut the recipe to serve one (ok two) and am enjoying it now! I'm a big fan of strawberry & pineapple combinations for smoothies and let me tell you the lime juice really adds a lot to brightening up the flavors in this daquiri. I did use some frozen pineapple in addition to the juice as I had just a bit left over from something else. I elimitated the ice since the frozen fruit served that purpose. Mmm! Strawberrylicious is right! Enjoy!",
