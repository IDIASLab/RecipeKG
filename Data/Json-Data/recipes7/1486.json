                "reviewBody": "Best Advice: Do a test run with 1 tart before you commit to making a whole batch. You will probably modify along the way as we did. Dough: I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour because the dough was too wet. It still baked too \"short\" (seemed like there was too much butter). Next time I will add even more flour. We don't own a mini-muffin tin so I used a regular muffin tin. Chill the dough before pressing into muffin tins so it isn't so soft to work with. I rolled out the dough with a rolling pin and pressed out circles with a large Starbucks coffee mug. Press into muffin tins taking care to be make the dough smooth evenly thin and the well deep enough. This will make for a nice presentation at the end. Make sure there is no airpocket underneath. Prick the bottom with fork before baking if not sure. Don't overcook the dough or it will be crumbly. Gelatin Mixture: I used a lot less water than called for as I wanted the gelatin to be thicker and actually \"set\" before serving it (as opposed to being runny). Strawberries: I also added a small tin of Mandarin oranges into the strawberry mix. I strained out any extra liquids from the strawberry/mandarin mix as it would dilute the jello. We chilled before serving because I wanted the jello mixture to \"set\".It was a lot of work but the presentation is worth it for a special occasion: wedding/baby shower etc. We made only 12 tarts because it takes so much time. We are going to try freezing the extra dough for future.",

Substituted berry jello-flavors and added blueberries to the final toppings. I used only a stick and a half of butter even less than what half the recipe calls for. My cups came out great! They looked beautiful and tasted like kolackys with sweet syruped fruit. To make my gelatin set better I added about 1tsp more of cornstarch to the warm syrup when I noticed it was too runny. Popped the final product in the fridge and in about an hour it was set.",

My girls are 3 years old and 20 months old and they enjoy rolling it into balls and pressing them into the muffin tins. Half the jello would have sufficed for us because we didn't get the tart shells thin enough. They still tasted great though especially with the whipped topping and I agree with the description they do taste like mini strawberry shortcakes. I used the light cream cheese as that is what I use for everything and they were great. I did need my teenage son to finish stirring the dough once all the flour was added because it was so thick. I tried using the electric beaters but after a while the dough liked to climb right up the beaters and stay there very hard to remove. Doesn't change my rating though.",
