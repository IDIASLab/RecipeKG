                "reviewBody": "Well the first time I made this recipe it didn t turn out that well. I liked the idea of it so much though that I decided to try again with some tweaks. The first time I used cup rhubarb and 1 cups water and reduced the water/sugar down to cup like the recipe states. This ended up with way too much watered-down dressing! So the second time I used cup rhubarb and cup water. I still cooked the rhubarb for 2 minutes and then removed and put it on the spinach like the recipe states. It also doesn t hurt to leave a few pieces of the rhubarb in the water. I simmered the water down to cup (about 10 minutes) this made it more of a syrup with a more concentrated rhubarb flavor. I also reduced the vinegar and olive oil to better proportions. While the water/sugar simmered (without the vinegar) I combined 3 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 Tbsp. vinegar in a container with a lid. I then took the reduced rhubarb water and poured it in the container and shook vigorously then poured it over the salad. Much better! As written this is a 3-star recipe. With my changes definitely 5-star! I will make this again! I ve written up a custom version of this recipe so you can see my changes. UPDATE: I made this again tonight and decided to serve it cold. I chilled the cooked rhubarb and dressing then tossed it with the spinach and some blue cheese bacon bits and walnuts. Yum!",

After spooning the rhubarb chunks onto the spinach I cooked down the remaining water until it was about 1/4 c then added 3 T olive oil and 1 T red wine vinegar. I poured all of it over the salad and mixed it up. My kids said it tasted like cotton candy! What a great salad. I can see using this as a base and adding in a variety of other toppings like boiled egg chunks bacon bits nuts etc. So glad I found this recipe.",
