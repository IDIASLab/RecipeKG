I ve had it printed out since March of 2009 and it is now dog-eared from dragging it out as weekend after weekend would go by with unfulfilled good intentions of making these. Today was finally the day. We were not disappointed CCL - these are indeed a winner and I m sure you don t mind that I made some small changes that didn t change your lovely recipe. I didn t measure the chocolate chips just tossed them in until it looked right for me. I used buttermilk mainly because I had some that needed to be used the baking soda required for that was already in your recipe so it worked well. As for the bananas I have fond memories of how I loved my mother s banana pancakes and I can still picture her slicing them into the batter so I had to do the same. Diced or sliced either is better than mashing them in my opinion. I love the creamy pieces of banana in the pancakes and not just the flavor of them. Finally I left out the nuts just because we preferred our pancakes without. Rich delicious and decadent these satisfied my curiosity as well as my craving. As for Hubs the guy who loves Chunky Monkey ice cream he gave these the thumbs up make again.",
