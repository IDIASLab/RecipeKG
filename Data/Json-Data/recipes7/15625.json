Very easy recipe to make but it took over an hour to bake at near sea level elevations. It's still very wet as in there is liquid under the crust. VERY sweet. VERY VERY sweet. VERY VERY cinnamon -y. The crust is wonderful. I poured it over the top and it left about an inch clear around the edges. That filled in as it baked. The top and edges are a chewey crispy goodness. I'll be using this elsewhere. Next time: I'll cut the cinnamon by half. The initial butter in the casserole dish will be a quarter cup (half stick). I will cut the sugar in the peach mixture down to a half cup. I'll probably drain the peaches as well both to cut the sweetness and liquid.",

I did accidentally grab the extra large size can of peaches and had to eyeball approximately what half of the can would equal to fit this recipe. It's possible I added too much of the heavy syrup from the can into the recipe as the end product had quite a thin liquid consistency that I don't really care for. The taste is amazing and the breading is outstanding. I just wish the peach liquid was more thick. Perhaps cornstarch might thicken it a bit. I did sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of white sugar over the top of the cobbler before baking and that ended up with a beautiful crispy crust on top. I will make this again for sure.",
