Tried this recipe and he thought they were sweet potato fries. My hubby loves ketchup with his fries said these were so good they did not need any! After he cleaned his plate and looked for more I told him what they were made from. He still doesn't believe it! The long baking brings out a real sweetness to the squash. My garlic burned some before the fries were done so will try garlic powder next time. Otherwise this recipe rocks! Thank you for the new healthy addiction!",

I used 1/2 of the neck of a big squash to get consistent fries about 1/2\" square 4\" long shook them in a bag of the ingredients and placed them on a mesh baking rack in my convection oven figuring both of these would help crispness. Cut time down to 30 min as some reviewers complained about overdone-ness. And I got mush Bad tasting mush most of them came apart when I turned them off of the rack. I wasn't expecting McDonald's fries but these were a huge disappointment almost inedible---and I like squash! How do you ruin squash??? Well you can depend on this recipe. Never again.",
