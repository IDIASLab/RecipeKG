I found some delicious homemade strawberry jam at the farmer's market and used that instead of raspberry jam. Instead of beating the jam into the batter I folded 1/4 cup in before placing into the cupcake pan. This way it it has streaks of jam running through. After baking i took a knife and took a little hole out of the middle then I warmed up the other 1/4 cup of jam for 10 seconds in the microwave and filled each cupcake. My peanut butter frosting I used 1/2 cup butter 1 1/4 cup peanut butter 1 1/2 cup pwd sugar and 3 tbsp of heavy whipping cream.",

I split the batter into two and made half with strawberry jam and half with blackberry jam made 10 of each with smaller cupcakes. As others have said this is a very dense cake not like a regular cupcake. I found after baking and tasting that there wasn't enough of the jam flavor for me so I cut out small holes in the middle of the cupcakes and added a little of the jams to give them more flavor then frosted. THESE WERE A GREAT HIT (made them for my father-in-law on his birthday he is a PB&J fanatic) Thanks for the recipe!:) I will make these again!",
