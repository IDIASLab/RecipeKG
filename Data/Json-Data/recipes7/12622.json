The olive oil gave it a great crunch. For some reason after the recommended time the rolls were not brown yet. So I raised the temp to 400 and left them in another 10-12 min until I liked the color. They were so delicious! A keeper no more packaged rolls for us! Also I think they would be great made into a sweet roll! Trying that next! Update: I have made these at least 6 times. They turn out great every time. I decided to make the dough the day before and put them in the fridge. Even with leaving them out for 2 hours they did not rise like normal. I do not recommend making them a day ahead. They still tasted delicious!",
