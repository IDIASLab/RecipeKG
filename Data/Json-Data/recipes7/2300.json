I'm really glad I did because if not I would of had a completely burnt top! I baked it at 350 as directed but set my timer for 35 min. Checked it after 25 min and the cake was just then done inside the marshmallows rose to the top and melted but already had burnt polka dots across the top. Still very yummy to me as I like the flavor of burnt marshmallow. Essentially this tasted like moist banana bread with a toasted marshmallow crust. It worked out nicely considering I just wanted to find a recipe to use one sad black banana and happened to have marshmallows too. The only thing I didn't have on hand was buttermilk so I used 1/2 tbsp lemon juice mixed into 1/2 cup regular milk which is a well known buttermilk substitute (you can use white vinegar too if you don't have lemon juice). I like this recipe since I can omit the marshmallows in the future to just make a great banana cake. I have friends who love Banana Moon Pies and this would be right up their alley. With the marshmallow craters maybe call it Banana Moon Cake? Thank you for posting!",
