I corrected you error in my making of it and it made an awesome loaf of bread! I think getting rushed forced me into not letting it raise enough but it still tasted great. I recently came across an article on making bread that the person turned an oven into a proof box by putting a pan of water on the lower shelf and heating the oven to lowest setting about 150 degrees and once it reaches that put the loaves into the oven after turning it off. the water will retain some of the heat and evaporate causing a high humidity environment for yeast to thrive.",

I added 1 tablespoon of rosemary I crushed by hand and I used 3 flours white AP whole wheat and white bread flour. I didn't add any salt because better than bouillon is salty enough on its own. I put the water yeast and sugar together then beat the eggs into that after proofing (since they're still cold). Mixed the flours and herbs in a separate bowl then put the wet and dry all into my stand up mixer bowl stirred it a bit and then let the dough hook do the rest of the work. After rising in a warm oven with a pan of water I divided the dough ball evenly using my scale and made half into a loaf and the other into rolls. I baked at the recommended temp but the rolls came out at 15 minutes the loaf at 25. The rolls are tasty the loaf deflated during baking somehow. I would make this again for rolls.",
