For those having trouble straining it try placing a double layer of cheese cloth over a bowl and secure with a large rubber band. Pour puree over cheese cloth and allow to drain. Repeat process using a sieve to get the smaller particles out. It's an extra step but much easier than trying to force it through a sieve the first time and gives you a much smoother puree to finish with.",

My only issue was trying to strain the rice mixture...it just didn't seem to be flowing through the sieve...maybe a drop at a time but at times not even that. I finally took a flat glass pitcher lid and used that to press the top of the mixture and then it came through. Does anyone know if there is a way to make that process easier? It did eventually work though and it tastes great! I highly recommend adding the rum. Thanks for the great recipe!",
