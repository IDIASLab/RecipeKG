The first said it's not very sweet & needs more filling. I upped blues to 5c sugar to 1/2c & added 1/2c flour to thicken; no chia seeds; 9x13. It's still only slightly sweet. As for the cornbread the batter was so thick it wasn't going to do anything once in the oven. I added a little milk to lighten the heaviness. Nothing particularly good - or bad - about this. Hoped for magic but it didn t happen. Can t eat it on Day2.:(... This is very good https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62424942/cobbled-blueberries/",
