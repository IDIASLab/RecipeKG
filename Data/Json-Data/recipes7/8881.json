Also changed vegetable oil to coconut oil and substituted monk fruit for the sugar for truly sugar free muffin. It says to pour batter but it came out like stiff cookie dough.  I added about another half a cup of milk and even then dropped in clumps of dough.  That being said they tasted great though dense. Will make again knowing to increase liquid",
