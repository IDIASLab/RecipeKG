I can\u2019t speak to how exactly it matches the restaurant dish since so many months have passed, but this is an absolute hit for our fall meals. I\u2019ve made it 3 times in 3 weeks already, nearly exactly as written, and we love it. Confession \u2013 we haven\u2019t had the chile paste, which is probably a major flavor element, so I can\u2019t be sure if our substitute of cayenne pepper is the same. Our result has a spicy sweet heat, and it\u2019s a great side to anything, with leftovers a favorite for our lunches. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t take a photo (maybe next time) \u2013 I already bought another squash!",
