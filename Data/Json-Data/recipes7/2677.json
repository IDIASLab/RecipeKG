Kokub, one of our neighbors, makes the most amazing mango chutney. A few years ago she invited me to help her. Of course, she doesn't use a recipe, so the NEXT time I went over with my measuring cups and scale so I could recreate her magic on my own. What an incredible experience!",

                "reviewBody": "Yum!  This one is GOOD and EASY to make.  I misread the recipe and added the vinegar to the mango batch.  I decided not to let it sit overnight and I just cooked it on low for about an hour till it thickened.  I left it in the back of the fridge for a couple of days.  It doesn't have that golden colour (that was probably because I didn't properly caramelize the sugar) but it tastes great.  Very mild even though I doubled the chili.  I will make this again as it satisfied my craving for mango chutney.  Oh and I made the garlic ginger paste by putting the ingredients into a small food processor instead.  Thanks! Update:  2 weeks later and the flavours are amazing!!!!  I'm literally eating this out of a jar with a spoon.  The only problem with this recipe is the whole spices obviously aren't edible.  However they are essential as they make the chutney taste so good!  I'd suggest serving it in a separate bowl and picking out the spices before serving.",

This time, I had access to whole spices and used them.  WOW!  Amazing flavor!  But you do have to pick out at least the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and cloves before serving.   Recipe is super easy and versatile, too.  I diced my mangoes and threw in a handful of raisins as well.  I think pineapple would also make a good addition too.  As others have said, if you like it hot, just add more pepper flakes as its mild enough for children as is.  I like my chutney mild to take the heat out of the Indian dishes I make, so this is perfect for me.    Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!  A keeper in my box!  :o)",

Couple of questions: it takes me forever to make the ginger/garlic to form a smooth paste using a pestle and mortar - any suggestions? Also I have cardamom pods...but I cannot find just the seeds. Can I just break open the pods and use those seeds? I have been using cardamom powder...it must be all right because it tastes great! Thanks again!",

A bit of initial preparation involved in this recipe but is worth it when I handed the lovely little jars out for christmas presents!

Because I hate my food processor when making the paste of the garlic and ginger I placed them in a mortar and pestle with the 1 teaspooon of coarse sea salt and then squashed them--the salt helps them break down!",
