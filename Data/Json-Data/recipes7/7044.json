Another review said it was a little dry so I added 1/3 cup(ish) of strawberry preserves to the strawberries and instead of gently mashing them as the recipe suggests I pulverized them until it was nice and juicy. I ended up not having any powdered sugar or vanilla on hand I used a little honey to sweeten it up. I also didn't layer it in a bowl just used a cake pan with less amount of layers. If you have the patience let it sit overnight in the fridge to really let the layers blend because it was definitely better the 2nd day. Give this one a try!",

Our local grocery makes their angel food cake cloyingly sweet so please add more sugar to the whipped cream cheese or strawberries if it needs more sweetness. I also don't go too crazy with mashing the strawberries because this is a dish I make for picnics and I don't want it getting all soggy while it sits.

The cream cheese adds a depth and richness to the whipped cream and makes it a little less sweet which made it better to me but you might want to play with the sugar amounts if you want something sweeter. I sprinkled Amaretto on my cake layers and then added almond slices toasted in butter to the top layer of the strawberries and cream for some crunch and additional flourish.",
