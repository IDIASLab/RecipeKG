I have made this recipe twice first time as written second time using brown sugar and not browning prior to adding the remainder of the ingredients. I found the white sugar difficult to use (see my initial review at the end of this review) but using the brown solved the problems I had had. Also I brought the sauce to a boil then simmered for about 5 minutes only as I was worried it would burn. I used dried curry leaves and star anise found in my local Asian grocery. I now rate this as a \"4\" star (a recipe has to be really remarkable for a \"5\" from this reviewer). The taste is very good and the consistency is just thick enough. I do hope people will try this as it adds an interesting salty/sweet taste to rice noodles etc. Thanks again Rocky. The following is my initial review left attached as it might provide a few hints about the recipe: This is an interesting recipe. I did have some difficulty with the first step which was browning the sugar then adding the soy sauce. The sugar clumped quite badly and then when the sauce was added it was nearly impossible to dissolve. I carried on adding the water and seasonings and brought the mixture to a boil. I thought at this point the sugar might dissolve and kept it at a slow boil for a few minutes but thought I could smell a bit of burning so took it off the heat. After it had cooled I strained it and tasted. I couldn't discern any burnt flavour. All in all it tastes prett",
