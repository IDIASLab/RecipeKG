Not too sweet very chocolatey light as air - they have the texture of eating a cloud of chocolate. They really are chocolate air cookies in this sense. And watch out because with kids around they disappear into thin air! They're addictive. I melted the chocolate in the microwave to speed things along. I made a half portion and got 12 cookies. I baked them for 10 minutes then left them in the oven with the door cracked for 5 minutes. Once cooled they are quite delicate so be careful.Quick and easy to make; and the kids liked them: what more could make life easier? Thank you Epagoza for your lovely recipe.",

Used lemon juice instead of cream of tartar. They turned out looking a little odd - kind of in two layers with a crispy merengue-like layer on top and a chewy almost brownie like layer that spread out underneath. However they were DELICIOUS and I will absolutely be making this recipe again (though I might practice making some plain merengue first)",
