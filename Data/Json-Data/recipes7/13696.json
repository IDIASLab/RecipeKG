A bit labor intensive, but they are so worth it! Great for dunking in tea or coffee, or just munching on. I double the recipe and give them out for Christmas every year.",

I used Sambuca for the flavoring and substituted 1/2 c. Whole wheat in the flour mixture. (I always use King Arthur flour.) I chilled for only about an hour then used a large spoon to put the batter on the cookie sheet and floured fingers to pat it into logs. I ll make this again but really prefer the taste of a butter recipe. They have a nice shape and don t crumble.",
