This was mushy,  unattractive,  and probably one of the most  unappealing desserts  I've ever made (which might explain why no photos have been submitted for this dessert). The crust is fairly tasteless, the cream cheese \"layer\" basically curdles into the rhubarb, and the sour cream \"layer\" is too thin to warrant being called a layer at all.  Down the garbage disposal it went.",

I doubled the crust for a 13x9 in pan and added about 1/4 cup sugar instead of the 2 tsp- wasn't nearly sweet enough. I also used powdered sugar for the cream cheese layer and sour cream layer. Used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 vanilla yogurt only bc I ran out of sour cream. Added vanilla to the cream cheese per Diana's instruction- gave it more depth. Also because I doubled the crust I baked it a little longer too. really good recipe- I suggest you try it today!",

Made exactly as written in an 11x7 pan (which I didn't realize I even had) and it came out perfect. I almost didn't bother with the sour cream layer but glad I did it. It doesn't have to be a thick layer just a little goes along way. Will definitely add this to my rhubarb favorites.",
