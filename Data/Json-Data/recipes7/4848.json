This recipe is right on I got 8 dozen out of a double recipe and I like bigger cookies! The are very soft cookies and the few that didn't get eating quickly lasted well. The dough is very thick but produces excellent cookies that have a similar taste to a brownie (only better!!) Next time I plan to replace the reese's pieces with pieces of chopped up Ande's mints!! I can't wait!!",

I used 1 c of white sugar and a T more of brown to help with the sweetness others said it missed. I also increased the salt to 3/4 tsp. I skipped the refigeration step slightly pressing them down and just put them straight in the oven for closer to 11-12 min. These were great! I found the mini-Reese's pieces at the store and this was the perfect recipe to use them in! Just be careful not to cook them too long the pieces will start to crack!",
