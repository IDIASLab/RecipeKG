In a large bowl I sprinkled them with juice of one lemon to keep them fresh.  I then peeled and thinly sliced three yams and mixed with the apples.  I added a healthy sprinkle of salt and ground pepper along with about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, two tbls of brown sugar, 1 tsp of white sugar and about a 1/4 cup of melted margarine.  I tossed all together and put into casserole dish and tightly covered. Baked at 350 for about an hour.  Very, very good and really easy.",
