This one seemed to fit the bill. I gave it a try, but I over cooked the squash. When I tried to brown it, it turned to mush. I was too committed to give up (I didn't have anything else to cook!) so I just went with it, and it was AMAZING!\nAfter I boiled the squash, onions, and dried cranberries, I tired to economize with the upcoming dish duty, so I put the butter and oil in the same pot that I boiled the squash in. After it got hot, I threw the squash/onions/cranberries back in and it all turned to mush when I started to turn the squash. \n\nAt that point, I just turned it into a mashed potato-style dish, and it was tasting pretty good. My date had a sweet tooth, so I turned the tablespoon of brown sugar into 1/4 cup and added a teaspoon of allspice for kicks. When it was done, it looked like mashed sweet potatoes with a parmesan on top (I forgot the almonds b/c I tasted it and didn't want to stop eating it), and it was a huge hit.\n\nMoral of the story... the flavors going into this dish are pretty versatile, so feel free to experiment with it a bit!",
