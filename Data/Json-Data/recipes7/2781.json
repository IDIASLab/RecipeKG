I pretty much copied the recipe but omitted the Jalape\u00f1os and replaced them with more scotch bonnets. I also used jam sugar (that's what we call it in the UK anyway) which has added pectin in it and made the sauce a little thicker.  Any ideas what the shelf life is in the refrigerator with this amount of vinegar?  Thanks for posting it.",

The only difference was that I decreased the sugar to 1 Tbsp and added a can of sliced peaches. Because of my change it came out a little too sweet but it aged wonderfully. After a couple of weeks the jar or so that I had left was FANTASTIC! Sweet and very hot! Goes great on so many things. If you like it less sweet I would recommend either sticking to the recipe or perhaps using 1 Tbsp sugar and half a can (or less) of peaches.",

My latest has been a variation of this one... Reduce peppers to only 12-14 Scotch Bonnets (don't remove the seeds), reduce garlic to 3 large cloves, 1-2 tomatoes, increase vinegar to a tad less than 1/4 cup, 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice (or to taste), and a few dashes of curry.  For the onion, I use a sweet/vadalia.  Everything else is the same. It still packs plenty of punch but has subtle hints of citrus.  If you try this variation, let me know.
