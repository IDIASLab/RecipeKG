I thought the sweetness of the bananas and the maple syrup would be enough for the bread but I should have doubled it to 2/3 cup to make up for the lack of sugar. I couldn't taste the maple at all which was disappointing. It was still pretty good although it got a little overdone. I checked it at 40 minutes and it was still very gooey in the middle so I let it bake another 10 minutes. It looks borderline burned on the bottom and sides but at least it doesn't taste burnt! Still it could have used a few less minutes maybe 45-47 total. I'll make it again with the proper amount of sugar and maybe just lower the temp a little. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the lack of mapley flavor.",
