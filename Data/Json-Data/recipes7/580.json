As part of French tradition, a bean or small china feve (favor) is hidden in the cake. The person who finds the feve in his or her slice becomes king or queen for the day. The person can also choose someone to be their king or queen and can lead the traditional dance.",

I used an entire roll of almond paste -- twice the amount called for in the recipe -- and that seemed to me to be the correct amount. I also used a bit more sugar and a T of water to make up for the difference in the extra almond paste. \nOther than the wrong amount of almond paste, it's a good recipe. I would think, though, that it would maybe be better to put on a second egg wash with a good amount of regular sugar rather than the powdered sugar. This way, I think that the gallette would have a shellaced quality and you'd be able to see the criss-cross pattern on its top much better.\nEasy and impressive cake,though, in spite of my criticism, I'm going to make this again.",

Agree with reviewer Annsera that 1/4 c almond paste might be a bit scanty - I increased it to almost 1/2 c. Also increased cooking time to about 18 minutes for fully baked look. I'm not much of a cook but true to the reviews this was quite easy to make and the result is attractive and delicious. A huge hit with the family.
