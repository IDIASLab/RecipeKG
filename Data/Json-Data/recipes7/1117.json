It's best served in a wrap with lettuce and tomato or over your favorite green salad. I have found it's also very easy to make even lighter by using fat-free broth, lite soy sauce, and sugar substitute - none of which affects the taste!",

I've made it several times to have for lunch with weekend visitors and we just took it to an evening, outdoor concert.  Followed the recipe as-is (did not use anchovy).  Lots of flavor from the cilantro, garlic and shallots, but not too much.  It is great.",

I only shredded two chicken breasts into the lime mixture; next time I'd double the dressing if using all four chicken breasts. Added a splash of rice vinegar to the lime juice. To improve even more I'd add a dash of sesame oil to give it a bit more Asian flavor and perhaps a bit of minced green onion. Nonetheless excellent and a wonderful base for ideas.",

Others mentioned that cooking the chicken in the soy sauce/lime mixture was for naught, so I saved 2 tablespoons of that mixture and mixed it in with the shredded chicken to make sure I had some of that flavor still.  I also added a large handful of shredded parmesan cheese and we ate this on pitas with a slice of swiss cheese.  It was very good.  Will definitely make this again.",
