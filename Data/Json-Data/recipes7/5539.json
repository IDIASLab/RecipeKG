(Maybe ice should be on the ingredients list) Anyways, I made this with 2 quart (8 cup) water and chilled it so that ice won't be necessary. Adding mint tea made it extra refreshing (plus I like mint). Giving 5 stars!",

Sometimes you just have to follow your gut on things like this and I was pretty sure that 3/4 cup sugar for a quart of tea was going to be way too sweet (at least for us). You can always add more but can't take it out. Very nice and easy ice tea.",
