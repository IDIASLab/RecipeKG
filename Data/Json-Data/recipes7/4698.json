Adding the paprika to the mixture gave it an off color. Way to much vinegar. Strong tasting & made it runny. I'm wondering if it was suppose to be 1 tablespoon & 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1-1/2 tablespoons. My opinion would be to use cheddar cheese to add more color & taste. Maybe salad dressing would have been better than using mayo & vinegar. I won't ever know. From now on I'll just stick to making regular deviled eggs. Update: After being refrigerated it isn't so juicy. The vinegar taste has mellowed somewhat. It's edible but not something that says \"Wow\". Maybe my problem. When I take something somewhere I want it to be \"Wow\".",
