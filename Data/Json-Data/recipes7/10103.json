However the one time I made them I had to add about another cup of flour because the first batch I made came out as flat square cookies added more flour problem fixed. The next time I made them I didn't add any extra flour but made them into small cupcakes. All times I added a lot more of the spices and a teaspoon of salt. Over all though the taste was good and they were moist and soft just needed a bit of tweaking.",

I really didn't think it was flavorful enough though even after doubling the cinnamon and vanilla and using a heaping 1/4 tsp of cloves. I would definitely at least double all seasonings if making again and sub half of the sugar with brown sugar. I also found that 2 Tbsp made way too large a cookie I was much more pleased with them when made with 1 Tbsp of cookie dough. And maybe sub cinnamon chips for the white chocolate? The recipe doesn't say to but I would also grease the pan these guys like to stick if you don't. But again- AWESOME texture! This one shouldn't take much work to bring it up to 5 stars!",

I used shortening to grease my cookie pans and it kept them from sticking. I used baked pie pumpkin instead of pumpkin puree (the pumpkin flavor was still there). I also tinkered with the spices. I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger. I substituted the vanilla extract for cinnamon extract. I did not use any dried orange peel. It turned out great it was a big hit with my family and co-workers.",
