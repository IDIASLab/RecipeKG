I like that it primarily uses pineapple juice rather than orange juice, which usually makes a smoothie too tart.  I would recommend using frozen fruit to make it more refreshing (but additional liquid is needed if you do that). Tip* if you use very ripe strawberries, it cancels out the need to add the sugar.

It kind of tasted like a melted strawberry shake and I used a frozen banana. After I tasted the recipe I added about 8 ice cubes as I always do with smoothies because I prefer them icy cold. I also subbed the sugar with 1 packet of Truvia. Lately I have been throwing vegetables in them also and added a handful of shredded carrots but that was only to get some veggies in.
