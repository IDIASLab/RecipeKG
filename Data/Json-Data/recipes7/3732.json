I've made it several times and my preparation skills are improving with every time. Don't get scared away because of the sour cream, it matches perfectly with the sweet honey taste. The cake tastes the best after it's kept overnight in the refrigerator, the flavors will blend together nicely.  I use a 9x13 inch baking pan, but another similar size will do.",

I used baking \"wax\" paper to bake on and some layers came off more cleanly than others - possibly due to me not paying attention to which side of the paper I used! But I found there was plenty of batter for 5 sheets. I was unable to remove it neatly from the dish....so instead served it up in slices (squares). Regardless it received rave reviews and was one of the first cakes gone at a function with many other options.",

I had to double recipe to get 4 layers about 8/9x12\" each they did rise and looked good. I will try to post a picture later. They stick to the parchment paper badly. To remove paper without ruining your cake you need to use damp kitchen towel. Put your cake paper side down on the damp towel let it rest for a minute then turn it over and carefully remove paper. And just so you know this is not an alternative to Medovik (Russian honey cake). It's not the same. It's very very chewy rubber like it was impossible to make crumbs out of this. The layers soaked up all filling and I did use a lot but the cake was extremely dry anyways. I made hundreds of honey cakes in my life (my Mom's favorite:o)) (with water bath or melting honey with soda until foamy and brownish there are many techniques) this is the first one I threw away. I will stick to my old recipes 3 tbsp honey is enough to make yummy layered honey cake. I will not be making this again.",

Used it the other day just to try out and was pleasantly surprised to find out it's less messy and not as time-consuming as my traditional recipe of a Russian honey cake that involves melting honey and eggs in a pot over the hot water rolling the dough and cleaning the sticky mess afterwards. Imagine that!! This one is priceless the dough is very soft and flexible doesn't break when you scrape it off the paper. Took me about 1 5-2 hrs max to whip the the whole thing. Love it!!!",
