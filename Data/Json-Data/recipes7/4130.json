The first time I made it the sugar and almonds just made a gloppy lump in the pan. I added a bit of water about a Tbs. and heated until the water boiled and evaporated. This created nice crisp sugar-coated almonds. I cool them on a plate that has a light coating of no-stick spray. This salad will become a standard in our home.",
