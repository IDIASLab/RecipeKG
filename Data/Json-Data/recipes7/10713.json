Except for the cinnamon and vanilla, which submitter lists as optional anyway, this is the same recipe as the wildly popular and 5-star \u201cFluffy Pancakes,\u201d also from this site, with well over 5,000 reviews.  So I already knew these were going to be delicious!  I used buttermilk rather than the soured milk (same difference essentially) and, just as I learned and have been doing since I was a little girl, mixed the batter till blended but with some small lumps still remaining.  I did not add the optional vanilla or cinnamon.   Now here\u2019s Hubs\u2019 eloquent review of the day. \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d he muttered with a mouthful of pancake and pure maple syrup. How helpful is THAT? With my usual frustration I asked him HOW good.  \u201cDelicious good,\u201d he responded.  I don\u2019t think it could be stated any better!  We haven\u2019t had pancakes in several years and to be reintroduced to them this morning using this recipe was our win.  They are indeed fluffy and light, with just the right amount of lift.  The recipe is dead on with both the levels of salt and sugar resulting in perfectly enhanced flavor with no baking powder aftertaste.  Simply excellent, and just as is, without the additions of cinnamon or vanilla.  No doubt that would be good too, but I say if you\u2019re only going to have pancakes once every blue moon, why mess with the perfect, classic rendition.",

The pancakes are fluffy, moist, and have a wonderful texture.\n\nI have a few warnings to those who are unfamiliar with this recipe:\n1. do NOT add the vanilla. In my experience this negates the effect of souring the milk and the pancakes end up  flat.\n2. DO mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately and then just barely combine immediately before cooking. This is not the batter to make in advance or let sit a while.\n3. Do not over mix. Any mixing beyond combining takes fluffiness away from the pancakes.\n4. Cook them low and slow. These will burn before cooking through if you don't use low, even heat to cook them. a cast-iron skillet works great.\n5. Make a big batch once you have confidence. These will be popular. My family of three adult eaters and two children quadruples the recipe and ends up with just a couple single-serving leftovers for the freezer. But then, we really like pancakes.\n\nFor a little extra moistness, add 1/4 cup cottage cheese for each serving. This is a real winner with my whole family, including a couple kids who would never knowingly go near cottage cheese.\n\nEnjoy!",

I did try the recipe with the amounts of vanilla and cinnamon recommended & they were really good.  I added more milk because the hubs and I wanted a thinner pancake.  I think next time I'll try these plain, without the cinnamon and vanilla (and my adjustments above). Thank you for the recipe!",

You  will need to increase the buttermilk to 1 cup as buttermilk is thicker than soured milk. The buttermilk really makes for a lighter, fluffier pancake. I don't add the cinnamon or vanilla. \n\nI keep this mix in a jar on the shelf in my pantry so I don't have to stop and mix the dry ingredients every time I want to make pancakes. The mix recipe is- 6 cups all purpose flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1 Tablespoon baking powder, 1 Tablespoon kosher salt, 2 Tablespoons sugar. Use 1 cup dry mix and add the liquid ingredients from the recipe (1 egg, buttermilk/soured milk, and butter). Having the mix already on the shelf speeds up breakfast.",

I cut my white flour to 3/4 and put a 1/4 whole wheat flour added 2-3 tb spoons of ground flax seed eliminated the butter and added plain greek yogurt. You can't tell the difference without the butter and this & plus the flax add lots of protein. I did cook them on a lower heat because the batter is thick and takes longer to fluff up. I did add a little more sugar to sweeten them up for the kids but you can't really tell. I have made them 2x so far and you can't tell the difference so if you want to add protein try it.",
