It's delicious! You get a very nice nutty flavor (that I'm sure you could intensify by toasting the walnuts before adding them to the cake which is something I did not do) with a hint of vanilla and the perfect amount of sweetness! I made the cake exactly as stated and it's awesome and very forgiving too! I accidentally dropped it on my parchment paper and it didn't crack or break at all! It's easy to roll out and handle. I did use powdered sugar in place of granulated sugar in the cream filling and added a bit of vanilla. I might also chop the walnuts a bit finer next time just to make cutting the cake a bit easier. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! Fantastic recipe and so easy to make too! Thank you!",
