I blended the egg yolks & sugar together and placed this in a double boiler, and added the vanilla and cream.  I continually stirred this mixture until it had thickened.  I then poured it into ramekins and refrigerated it.  After it cooled I used a finally ground turbinado sugar (raw sugar) and carmelised it w/ my butane torch.  Simple recipe but given the instructions wouldn't recommend this to a beginner.",

I mixed the egg yolks and sugar and vanilla together, heated the cream, added it a little at a time to the egg yolks.  Worked fine.   I didn't put it through a sieve, and cooked it in ramekins- but it only fit into 3 6oz ramekins.  Loved the taste.  It was quite thick.  I used a torch for the sugar- still getting the hang of that, but overall it was very good.",
