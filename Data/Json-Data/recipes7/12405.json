I tried with the first ones to make the criss-cross with a fork on the top but I prefer the meat tenderizer side to my mallet to make that design that I put on the second sheet of cookies. I did refrigerate them for a short time before baking them. This morning they are crispy on the edges and soft in the middle and make a yummy accompaniment to my morning coffee. Thanks Katherine! I think the little girls in my life will ask for more of these!",

Truly a treat - I have not found a good cashew butter cookie recipe - most are no flour no sugar no egg - this hit the nail on the head all around - conservative with the not so good for you ingredients but not missing anything. I did substitute an over-ripe banana for one tablespoon of cream/milk. I added a little more flour to make up for this extra liquid. My cashew butter was the oily kind too and I did half flour half almond meal - truly heavenly. Thank you for getting the ratios just right.",
