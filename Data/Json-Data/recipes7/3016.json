Usually I bake it with the cut side up and coat it with butter and a light coat of brown sugar. This time I tried baking it as directed and it came out nice and moist too. \n\nAfter baking in the oven I removed the skin and then covered it with butter, sea salt, fresh pepper, sprinkled brown sugar over it, and placed it back in the oven under the broiler just long enough to caramelize the brown sugar. It came out delicious. The salt and pepper add a nice dimension to the flavor that was just perfect.\n\nThis is a simple recipe that tastes great.",

Instead of putting any water in with it, I cut it in half, scooped out the seeds then brushed it with olive oil.  I put it cut side up, sprinkled it with sea salt and cracked pepper and roasted it.. no water.. for about an hour to an hour and a half at 350 until it was soft enough to mash.  I let it cool so it was easy to scoop out and mashed it up with some butter and a dash of ground ginger.. no sour cream.. it was smooth and creamy on it's own.  No sugar needed, either!  The roasting brought out the sweet of the squash and it was perfect!  Just before serving I put it in the microwave for just a minute to heat it up and topped it with a pat of butter.. YUM!",

As for the commenter who rated this a one, I don't understand such a low rating when I take it that she didn't even try it yet. Just add an inch of water. Add a little more if the squash isn't done and if the water goes down. The purpose of the water is to gently steam the squash while it is baking. You end up with a very delicate side dish that really only needs a little butter, salt and pepper. Very versatile, it can be mashed, pureed for soups or breads, or eaten right out of the shells.
