With the Splenda change I calculated it and each mini-muffin is about 35 calories. Amazing right? I also used a different blend of spices (1 Tbsp Cinnamon 1 tsp Nutmeg 1/2 tsp Cloves no allspice or ginger) just because that's how I like it. Aside from being healthy they taste great too. I probably should have halved the recipe because I might try to eat all 48 muffins in one sitting.",

At the last minute I threw in half a bag of butterscotch chips that I needed to use. These turned out really well though I wish there'd been more of a pumpkin flavor. If I make these again I'll use all pumpkin and eliminate the applesauce. I'm glad I added more spice they'd have been bland if I hadn't. NOTE: To help with a more fluffy muffin and to eliminate the \"rubbery\" texture wisk together your dry ingredients together and the wet ingredients together and gently fold the wet into the dry taking care not to overmix. The more you mix the more tough your muffin will be.",
