This recipe was (fortunately) a successful experiment as I crossed my favorite brownie and chocolate chip cookie recipes. My family likes it better than both. It tastes something like a peanut butter cup in cookie form.",

I grabbed butterscotch chips rather than peanut butter chips by mistake and subbed 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 cup oats(to add a little texture) otherwise followed the recipe. It's a bit sweet so I added almost 1/4 cup flour to the remaining 1/3rd of the batch which improved it. The butterscotch chips are far too sweet and attributed much to the over-sweetness. These are wonderfully tender cookies with a wonderful flavor. Good stuff deserves 4.5 stars or a 9 out of 10 rating by me. Very nice cookie. Almost forgot for added interest I sprinkled just a touch of salt on top of some of the cookies (less than 1/8th tsp for approx 24 2.5\" cookies). It was a nice surprise... salty and sweet chocolate. Hey they're not health food!",
