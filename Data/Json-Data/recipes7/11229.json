I used all milk increased the yeast to 1 tbsp and added 1 tbsp vital gluten flour for the eggs I used 1 whole egg and 2 yolks. Do not omit the nutmeg it is really understated I would double next time as the bread has a very delicate flavour. For the topping I used 1/8 cup each flour and sugar 1 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla powder. Mine baked in 45 minutes exactly I used 300 degrees as my oven is a convestion oven I covered with foil halfway through to prevent overbrowning I baked mine in a bundt pan as well. Nice Easter bread when you don't want something too sweet with your coffee. I made this for Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless",
