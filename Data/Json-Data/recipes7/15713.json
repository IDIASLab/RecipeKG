You can flatten them as desired.This is a flexible recipe. You can add a teaspoon (or more) of baking soda instead of baking powder if you want a thinner cookie. I think you can top these with some white chocolate chips after baking.",

They whip up in no time, one bowl, no mess and were ready in exactly eight minutes. Using the ube flour instead of the yam gives them a pale purple color rather than bold. If you're looking for bright purple you might add some food coloring because these are very light colored. Thank you for this fantastic recipe.",
