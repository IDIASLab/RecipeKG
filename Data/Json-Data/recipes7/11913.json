This made excellent moist bran muffins. I think raisin bran cereal could be substituted for bran cereal or I think other dried fruit such as cranberries would also make a nice addition. Also I think next time I will sprinkle with a bit of white sugar fresh out of the oven.",

The next time I make them I will try using whole wheat instead of AP flour. Thank you Motts",
