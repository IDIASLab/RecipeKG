It is indeed a cake appropriate for summer as it is not overly sweet or rich but it would be equally appropriate any time of year particularly after a heavy meal. The cake is moist and soft not exactly fluffy but certainly lighter than a pound cake. The lemon flavor is subtle so in my mind it really does need the Limoncello glaze to embolden it. I loved it as is but if I were to make it again I would add a little more lemon zest to really enhance the lemon flavor.",

I'm thinking of adding the lemon juice to it next time because the lemon flavor is so delicate, despite the zest of two lemons. The ingredients say \"one lemon, zested\", so I only used the zest. Did anyone take this to mean other than the zest? Could be that I misread the intention. Anyway, my husband does not love lemon, or cake, but he has raved about this cake and eaten it alone, with a glass of limoncello (see my photo), with ice cream, and drizzled with chocolate syrup. It's going into my permanent favorite recipe book I'm making to take along when we move to Italy.",

I also use more limoncello and peel then the recipe called for because I prefer a stronger lemon flavor. The limoncello used was my homemade version with a hint of lavender. As the cake cooled I had poked holes on the bottom using a wooden skewer & poured additional limoncello. Once it soaked through I had removed the cake from the pan & pour the icing onto the bottom of the bunt cake pan and poked additional holes on the top using the same method as I had on the bottom. Gently replaced cake back to the bunt pan lining the design of the pan with the cake until completely cooled. This was the best limoncello cake I've ever had!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.",

That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (because I made an addition). The cake reminded us of a pound cake and I served it with blueberry sauce as another reviewer did. I must say I thought this was a bundt cake because of the picture and didn't discover it was an 8\" cake until the day of my event. I made it in the bundt pan anyways and it was small of course because there wasn't enough batter but it was still pretty and good. Next time I will increase the ingredients by 50% and I'm hoping it will be a normal-sized bundt cake with that change.",

We ate some gave some to friends and family and I froze 6 of them. They thawed beautifully and were delicious months after they were made.
