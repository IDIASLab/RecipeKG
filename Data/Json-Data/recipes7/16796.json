While I do have a cake pan for my air fryer I chose to divide the batter into 3 ramekins and cooked them about 10 minutes instead. They were very brown on top and not brown at all on the bottom. I flipped them out of the ramekins and cooked 5 more minutes to brown the bottoms. The insides were a little gummy. I think if I tweak the amount of time they are cooked I may be able to get rid of the gumminess. I will be trying again.",

I added some Watkins butter flavor and vanilla because it didn't have any flavoring in the recipe and thought it would be bland. I cooked it in my AirFryer/Oven for the recommended time but it came out gummy and I don't think it needs to cook longer. I love the idea so I will be experimenting.",
