I how ever used a bag of frozen mixed berries blueberries were out of season for me at the time and I didnt wanna spend 10. Came out even better! I accidently added more milk than it called for but it didnt hurt the recipe at all. Over all I loved this recipe and so did my family a welcome treat for the holidays I wanted something different and I found it.",

I increased salt to 1/2 tsp and reduced the topping butter to 1/4 cup. This was absolutely delicious. How can you go wrong with all the wonderful fruits that God made?",

After reading a few of the reviews, I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup for each part that required it, and cut the cinnamon back to a rounded tablespoon and the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon for the apple mixture. The batter was very thick so I added a little bit more milk until it was a little more manageable, I still had to spoon it on to the apples, but it turned out great. It was still borderline too sweet, but lovely nonetheless. Some whipped cream would have solved that but I didn't have any. This made so much that I still might have a chance to try it with whipped cream tomorrow. Thank you!",

I used Becel margarine because I didn't have butter. If I were to make it again I would reduce the sugar in the Apple mixture and use a half cup. I'd also reduce the sugar in the topping as I found this dish sweeter than I would prefer. A nice change from the dishes that contain oats. Both my picky boys ate it.",
