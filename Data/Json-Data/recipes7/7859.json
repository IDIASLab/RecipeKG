                "reviewBody": "VERY GOOD!  It wasn't until I was ready to make the topping that I found I didn't have coconut.  I decided that I would skip the coconut and sprinkle with cinnamon after baking for added flavor.  (I've found that adding it prior to baking, the cinnamon tends to  burn).  When I sliced the strawberries they weren't the best so I bled them with a touch of sugar for sweetness.  As I was putting the strawberries on the batter there wasn't enough to cover it completely so I added a couple more.  I knew from making apple crisp that it is cold butter that you need to use for crumb topping.  For the topping, everything goes into the mixer at once and you use a whisk, mixing it until just prior to it becoming cookie dough.  Pea size crumbs.  Because of adding more strawberries, I baked it an additional 10 minutes.  It was in a glass 8 inch dish so I was able to watch closely that it didn't burn.  While it was cooling, I read some reviews of others adding vanilla.  I really thought I was going to have a problem but not so.  The strawberry flavor was very present and the cinnamon was a nice touch.  We both LOVED IT!  Thank you Sue Walker for sharing your recipe!   I'm sorry for not following it exactly but it was very easy to adjust with what I had.  The sign of a great recipe!",

I took the advice of others and reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added the 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. For the crumble I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. Once it was baked through I removed it from the oven and sprinkled with ground cinnamon (I didn't put it prior to baking so it wouldn't burn). It is delicious!! It was so simple to make and presents wonderful flavor. I love how the cake is moist. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my binder and using it again. I'll be making this next month with fresh picked blueberries and raspberries!!",
