They were so delicious (I must ask for the recipe) but we needed to return the plate they came with. So I decided at that moment to teach my children about a tradition I learned from my family when I was a little girl: \"when somebody gives you a plate (could be container bowl etc.) and you know they are expecting it back it is a very kind gesture to return something in it\". I think it doesn't need to be a food item or something you have to bake; it could be a card saying a simple thank you or the wonders about the food received it is up to your creativity. I remember my auntie sometimes used to just return it with some fresh vegetable or fruit from her garden. My daughter went online and found this delightful and easy vanilla cake recipe. She did not use the black sesame seeds but surely we would love to try it sometime.",
