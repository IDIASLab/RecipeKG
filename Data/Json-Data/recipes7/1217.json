One tip that really helped with the presentation:  Marinate in the delicious sauce for 24 hrs- then drain them before serving.  They will retain the yummy flavoring but won't be swimming in the sauce. Looks more like a carrot salad.  Ideal for a picnic or buffet table.  Even my picky kids loved this!!  I have added this to my favorites!!  Thanks for the recipe!",

The five star rating and many excellent reviews prompted me to give it a whirl. It may be better in the summer along with a picnic or cookout but it didn't entice us in the middle of the Winter. I did use whole baby carrots which I do agree make a better presentation. I marinated it overnight and it did blend all the flavors but had a bit too much vinegar for my taste. I like the idea of a Tomato flavor on the Carrots but I just do not like using canned soup in almost any recipe.",
