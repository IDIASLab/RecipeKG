Blueberries sandwiched between white.  The meringue became rubbery once topped.  The crust was okay.  It didn't become crisp or too much different than it was to start with.  Too many dishes, too much time, too ho-hum to make this again.  Maybe it's one of those recipes kids like more than adults.",
