I cut the sugar in half used 1-1/3 cups white vinegar and 3/4 cup apple juice for the apple cider vinegar and also used 2 tsp cinnamon 2 tsp allspice and 1 tsp dried ginger for the apple pie spice and used fresh golden beets( about 4 medium sized). To this I also added 1/3 cup dried gogi berries. i then proceeded to braise the whole mixture on the stove in a frying pan on medium heat. when the beets were \"al dente\" i stirred together 1 tsp cornstarch with 1 cup cold water then added it to the beets. when the sauce thickened i removed from stove and served.",
