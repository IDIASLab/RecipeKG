My ice cream version rivals the real thing and can be prepared in under half an hour, no pastry skills required - not a bad return on a dessert that serves up to 14 people. If you think your supermarket doesn't carry mascarpone cheese, look again. Just because you've never seen it doesn't mean it's not there. If you really can't find it, no worries. You can make the sauce with cream cheese; just follow the conversion method in the introduction to the recipe. If you have little espresso cups collecting dust in the china cabinet, bring them out.
