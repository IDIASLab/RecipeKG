When a 1 year old, a 2 year old and a three year old will eat a meal....that's a winner in my book! Thanks for the recipe! A must make....and now a family fav! Awesome!!!!!",

My hubby and I are watching our carbs these days so I substituted the potatoes for green beans and mushrooms that I had on hand.  Also after the 30 minutes I tasted it and decided it needed more lemon flavor, etc. so I drizzled more EVO, lemon juice over it.  Then sprinkled some Citrus Grill Seasoning from Durkee,  an All Herb Blend and a Mediterranean Sea Salt that I really like, over the top.  The flavor was phenomenal!!!!!  We kept dipping our chicken in the juices to mop up all that deliciousness!  Can't wait to try this on company.  Thanks joecraig for a great recipe!",

Although we didn't really eat the skin on the chicken it gave great moisture to the veggies! Really great and versatile dish.",
