I chose to use a DH box white cake in place of the scratch cake, but followed the recipe for the swirl and glaze.  I also chose to bake it in a bundt pan (about 38 minutes; you know cake is done when you press on the top and it bounces back). for nicer presentation.  This will see repeat action at the LTH house.  THANKS, for the recipe!",
