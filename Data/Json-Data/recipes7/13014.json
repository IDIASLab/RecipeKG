I sprinkled more flour (a lot) and more soda and powder and salt just eyeballing it. I left it quite wet since Wet-ish doughs seem to be a good thing. It could be that the chef's sprouted spelt was more absorbent. I used Bob's Red Mill spelt. In the end these were wonderful. Layers inside because of the pieces of butter and crunchy and beautiful on the outside. Embarrassed to say I ate four after they had cooled a bit. About the grated butter: I had to really work it with my fingers to get the grated pieces down in size to look like coarse crumbs.",

                "reviewBody": "I make scones as a Christmas treat for my neighbors every year. I usually make two types and this year decided to try these blueberry scones as my second type. I made the two (different) recipes back to back and noticed a few differences. The first recipe had eggs in it while this one did not. The second major difference was the cooking temperature. The first recipe baked at 375 for 25 minutes. I was surprised by the higher temperature and same cooking time for these scones. These blueberry scones taste delicious - they are not too sweet. However I felt that the dough was a little dry. I ended up adding more buttermilk. Next time I think I'll try baking them at the lower temperature - they seemed to get dark on the outside quickly but needed a little more time for the inside to get done. Finally I didn't like shredding the frozen butter. Next time I think I'll try the more traditional method of cutting the softened butter in with a pastry cutter. I don't expect it makes a real difference in the way they bake? Overall a good recipe and one I'll make again with these slight modifications.",
