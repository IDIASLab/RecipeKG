Next time I\u2019ll cut the juice down a bit(not the zest as it looks pretty in the jar).  I\u2019ll also put it in the crockpot on low overnight (8 or more hours) next time so I don\u2019t have to hover over the stove stirring for hours on end.  A note about checking for doneness: Don\u2019t go by the cooking time, drop a little on a plate and if watery liquid seeps out around the edges it needs to cook longer. Oh, and I got 7 half-pint jars (3-1/2 pints instead of the 2 pints stated).",

I followed the recipe as written and resulting product has a wonderful, deep pear-citrus flavor.  Here\u2019s what I learned from the process.    For multiple batches, don\u2019t cook more than one batch in each pot.  Combining batches adversely affects evaporation and product doesn\u2019t reduce properly.    It takes far longer to cook down than indicated- approximately 3 \u00bd hours for 2nd part.  Heat needs to be  on low heat and stirred every five minutes to prevent scorching.   Stirring frequently becomes more and more critical toward the end.  You can\u2019t leave this at all while it\u2019s cooking.  I used an emersion blender instead of a food mill or grinder.  Worked beautifully and it saved time, effort and pots.    Keep children or pets out of the kitchen while you\u2019re cooking this.  It\u2019s like edible napalm.  If it splashes on you, it sticks and keeps burning, so be careful.    It\u2019s never going to mound on a spoon- a tiny hill maybe, but not a mound while it\u2019s hot.  It\u2019s done when you put a spoonful on a plate, it stays together and the liquid does not separate significantly at the sides.    Understand that this is a labor of love to make, but it\u2019s very good.  It takes your undivided attention for a whole day (or two).  My kitchen is a wreck.  My stove, my pots and my floor are one big sticky mess.   I will certainly make this again, but not anytime soon.",
