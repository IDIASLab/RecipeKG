Its his birthday today and he likes this as a birthday cake lol so I'm checking out recipes to see if I can improve on the one I have currently. \nI usually leave the sugar out of the crust.  Us Aussies don't add excess sugar to crumb crusts with sweet baking as a rule. I also use a good pinch of cream of tartar in the egg whites to stop weeping. I wish I could find a recipe for a firmer custard - this pie never cuts cleanly. Still, its very popular in my house. I can't get Aussie's to enjoy it, its a bit too different for our tastes, but I like it.",
