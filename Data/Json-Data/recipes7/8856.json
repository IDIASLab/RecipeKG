After looking at lots of recipes and comments I chose this one because of its simplicity and preference not to use powdered creamers (unhealthy and full of ). Unfortunately the cocoa tastes much better with the powdered creamer. However it can be made as is and then add real half-and-half to the cocoa when making it. I increased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups increased the cocoa powder to 2/3 cup and added 2 cups powdered creamer. I also blended all the ingredients in a food processor to make more refined. Next I'm going to try a batch and add crushed up candy canes while in the food processor. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I took note of what a previous reviewer said about cheaper powdered milk being more granular and since the cheap stuff is what I had on hand I put the dry milk in the blender first and made it into a nice fine powder. Then I blended the rest of the ingredients in with it (I also used powdered sugar instead of granulated). My husband usually turns up his nose at homemade cocoa mix but I think with the smooth texture of this method he might actually approve (and hooray for going without the artificial sweeteners and other garbage they hide in the store-bought stuff!)",
