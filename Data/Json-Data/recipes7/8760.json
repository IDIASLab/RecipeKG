                "reviewBody": "The aroma of these as I was mixing them were wonderful, and the flavor was great too.  However, there are a few key ingredients left out of the original recipe post, so this is how I made my gravy:\n\n2 T butter\n1/4 cup flour\n1.5 cups beef stock\n1/2 cup cream\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1 teaspoon Worchestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\n\nThe recipe doesn't say how many meatballs this made.  Making 2-3 tablespoon-sized meatballs gave me about 34 pretty big meatballs (like, spaghetti-and-meatball size versus IKEA meatball size), which needed to cook longer than the 20 minutes allotted.  Mine ended up cooking for 40 minutes, and were slightly tough on the outside, and the temp only got to 150 inside with my thermometer, but they were definitely done.  I think next time I will cook for a little longer at a lower temp to not have the outside so overdone.\n\nAlso, the recipe called for making the gravy before making the meatballs, but I would definitely make the gravy AFTER they are cooked since it really doesn't take more than a few minutes to whisk up.  The amount of gravy made with my measurements there only really coated about half the recipe (the hubby is a gravy fanatic, plus we wanted some for the potatoes too), so I'd at least double it next time since it's very thick, and doesn't stretch far.  Because I was waiting so long for the meatballs to cook, the gravy got super thick, but a little splash of beef stock helped loosen it as I warmed it back up on the stove.",

I was in a rush so this made the cooking time faster, and took a couple extra shortcuts.  I did not saute the onions-I just minced them, and did not chill the meatballs either, I just rolled them & tossed them right in the oven. (came out fine!)  I started the gravy (I also added a bit of nutmeg to the sauce)after the meatballs were in the oven for about 10 minutes so both were hot & ready at the same time.  I should add that I only made enough meatballs for 3 but kept the gravy amount as written so we would have plenty for the egg noodles we topped this dish with. We loved the flavor, and these will replace the recipe I've used in the past!",

The gravy was perfect, although I must admit I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and had to thicken the gravy a bit with Wondra. But that's not a complaint; I substituted according to what I had on hand. I may increase the seasonings just a tad next time. This will be my go-to recipe for Norwegian (oops - Swedish)meatballs.  2018 edit -- this year I doubled the amount of onion and used a generous measure of the spices.  Perfect!  And with heavy whipping cream (instead of my substitute last time) the gravy was fantastic.  I usually make a triple recipe and freeze them on the cookie sheet after baking (after they're frozen put in an airtight container) so when I serve them I just have to make the gravy and add the meatballs.  It's an easy make-ahead dinner (or appy) for a large group.",

Loved the meatball seasoning.  Gravy was very good, used lowfat condensed milk in place of cream and for extra deep flavor in the gravy, I added about a 1/2 tsp. instant coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but this is an ingredient I have always put in Swedish meatballs to deepen the flavor. I served them over spatzle.",
