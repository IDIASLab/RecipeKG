I didn't follow measurements to the glaze. I used the juices and zest of one whole lemon and whisked in icing sugar till it was a thick glossy consistency. My icing hardened and was glossy. They are beautiful to look at with the zest poking through. Thanks for the inspiration to have and make a brownie that's not chocolate :)",

I found that the glaze was too runny, whether it was my doing or the fact that it needed more powdered sugar is unknown.  I would double the amount of powdered sugar in the icing part.  It was hard for me to give up the way I usually mix recipes like this--creaming the butter and sugar and then adding the eggs, etc.  I'm sure that these directions make it more like a sponge cake than a regular cake.  I would make these again and make the icing different.  I used four lemons for this, three for the lemon juice (my lemons weren't very juicy) and the fourth for all the zest I used.   Making these in a 9\" pan made it possible for me to use a cookie cutter to cut out the shape.  Thanks, BronsonsMom!",
