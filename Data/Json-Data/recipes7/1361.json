Season with salt and pepper to taste. 3) For the sauce, use two 10oz tubs of Buitoni alfredo (found in the refridgerated case) - simmer the sauce on the stove with 1/2 cup dry white wine and season with pepper. Follow baking directions as written, but sprinkle with mozzarella cheese 5 min before removing from the oven. This is a dish I would be proud to serve to company!",

The only things I did differently were to make my own Alfredo Sauce (using Easy Alfredo Sauce 1 from Allrecipes) and I added about four sliced white mushrooms to the sauce. Eight minutes of boiling the manicotti shells is probably enough; much longer and they're more at risk of ripping as you're trying to stuff them. A tsp of sugar is listed as an ingredient but not mentioned in the directions: add it to the chicken broth.",

I made my own alfredo sauce 1 package cream cheese 1 stick margarine 2/3 cup milk 1 cup parmesan cheese I added all the seasonings to it plus some extra garlic powder because it didn't have much taste. I added some milk to the stuffing mix because it was a little too dry for my liking. I also used the shells instead of manicotti noodles but needed an extra set of hands to stuff them. I put all the \"stuffing\" into a baggie and cut the corner off to make it easier. I have a big family so I pretty much doubled everything but could have made more sauce to cover it. Then added some shredded Parmesan cheese to the top of it and poured some of the chicken broth into the bottom of the pan around the noodles before cooking. The family loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. It is a very rich dish but yummy! I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",
