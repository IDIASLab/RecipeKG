This is a very special recipe acquired when I worked at a Chinese restaurant to pay for my red '66 VW bug when in high school! The recipe card is tattered and spotted now, but the dish is the best egg foo young I have ever had. Hope you enjoy it too! To serve, place egg patty over steamed rice and put the sauce on top.",

I used fresh bean sprouts instead of canned,  and defrosted salad-size  shrimp in a salad spinner to ensure that all excess liquid was gone.  I used a vietnamese soup stock (pho) concentrate instead of chicken broth which added additional flavor to the sauce.  I love to eat egg foo young for breakfast!",

As a Baltimorean raised on this dish (Chinese carry-outs on every street corner)I am used to brown gravy over the patties. I used this recipe but... I used 5 eggs, and after frying the patties smothered them in brown gravy. I topped the white rice with the gravy covered patty and drizzled soy sauce  over it. I cooked my shrimp (no little salad shrimp for me) Maryland style using  1/4 cup beer, Old Bay Seasoning, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, and I/4 cup water. Every bite was delicious !!! Compliment the meal with  Plum wine and enjoy1 Bon appetite!!!",

I did use diced chicken, beat 5 eggs instead of 4, added a whole can of drained LaChoy chinese vegetables along with the green onions and garlic powder.  I found non-stick mini-skillets (the type to fry one egg) to make the patties perfectly round and all one size.  I made the sauce as written the first time and did not like the vinegar addition, so omitted it the second time, used less sugar and it was excellent.  Couldn't get a thick consistency with the cornstarch, so added more than written.  Making again for dinner tonite.  Great recipe !",
