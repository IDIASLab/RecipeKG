The cheesecake itself is probably the best part for me, and I might just make the cheesecake portion in the future and leave off the curd and meringue.  (Just a tip--if you make homemade curd, don't use a metal bowl! It will leave the curd with metallic taste---use a glass bowl. No plastic either!) I'm really fond of the fact that this cheesecake wasn't baked with a water bath. It gives it a nicer, denser texture--which I really prefer. I baked the meringue for about 12 minutes, and it was browned, but the middle was still kind of soft. It could of probably baked  a little longer, but I was afraid of the peaks burning. Overall, I would make it again with a few minor changes. It was a learning experience for me lol.",

Mine did take longer to bake and I think I may have jiggled it too much when trying to figure out if it was done and it fell a bit. With the lemon curd and meringue you would never know though ;) I did use a jar lemon curd but in the future I would make my own instead of being lazy. My meringue was perfectly cooked, I took it out at 9-10 minutes. I did have crust issues but, I was attempting a gluten free crust and sometimes cookie crusts can be tricky. In the future I would use my go-to graham cracker crust.",

A few changes - used a graham crumb crust, and also find that making the batter in the food processor makes it much smoother than using the hand mixer.  \n\nThe lemon curd recipe used the 4 yolks left over from the separated eggs for the meringue,  and it does tend to 'weep' a bit down the sides of the cake after baking the meringue. This time, I've frozen the cheesecake and curd, and will try baking the meringue on the frozen cake.",
