Cooking time increased but it still turned out tender and delicious. I used a large cast iron skillet. I served it with brown and jasmine rice and the Eggplant with garlic sauce recipe. The whole house smelled like an Asian restaurant for the next few days but it was worth it! I used 2 serranos instead of green chile peppers but it wasn t that spicy. I also added a tiny bit of fish sauce when adding the sesame oil but I don t think I added enough for it to taste much different. I cooked 4 lbs of pork but cooked in 2 batches. For the 2nd batch I just added 1 cup of sugar to the sauce already in the pan.",
