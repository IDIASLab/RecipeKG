I would add cinnamon to give it more flavor or even vanilla. I thought the apple amount was going to be too much but it was perfect. However I could not get the syrup to reduce. After 30 minutes of fighting it from it becoming rock candy after adding the cider and then boiling it to under half.. it still was pure liquid.",
