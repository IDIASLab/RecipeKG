The dessert for this particular event was to be individual chocolate cakes, but someone took them out of the ovens too soon and the centers were not cooked enough and still liquefied. Well, there was no time to take them off the plates and bake them more, so the chef simply had his wait staff introduce the dessert as Chocolate 'Lava' Cake! Brilliant!",

I served it in the ramekins, because the top of my cake was cracked, so I thought it will look cool just like that. And I served it with vanilla ice cream, perfect!! If you love chocolate then you'll love this recipe, I for sure will make it again and again. Picture uploaded :)",

So that you get the right consistency with your eggs and sugar mix. Mine came out a little flat but I believe that it was because of the consistency of my egg and sugar mixture. It still came out great! Thank you very much John! This turned out to be a great ending to our mother's day dinner.",

                "reviewBody": "Wonderfully rich! Warning however!! I tried this recipe to test it before I served it to company and made 4.  With 4, as the recipe called for, it turned out exactly as expected at 18 minutes in my oven.  The next day I adjusted the servings to 12.  Instead of the nice cake-like batter I'd got the day before was more brownie batter-like.  I baked, as called for 18 minutes and couldn't tell if they were done or not.  Of course I can't poke the center with a toothpick, so I was uncertain to know when they were done as they looked OK, but didn't want to bake too long and loose the centers.  So I took them out at 18 minutes and let sit for the 15 minutes.  When I inverted them onto a plate, they were not done, even though I was able to run a toothpick around the edges and have it be clean.  They could have baked 3 or so minutes longer.  I then remembered the day before, when I got great results, the edges were JUST starting to pull away from the sides.  So if you intend to make larger batches and bake them together, remember to bake a bit longer and watch for those edges, or you may end up with chocolate pudding instead, like I did.  Good luck!",

I had to make it,  so I went to my favorite website!  This recipe was so simple and quick.  I was amazed.  I melted 4 oz of tollhouse chocolate chips with the butter because that was all I had.  It tated like the ones I've gotten at a restaurant!  My batter was not thick and I'm sure it is because I used my KitchenAid mixer and didn't attempt to mix it by hand.  I did not put it in a bag (i just didn't see the point), I did not refrigerate and I didn't cook it in a pan of water.  They did none of that on MasterChef :).  Why make more work for yourself.  Everyone's oven is different, but I cooked them for 11 min.  Next time, I will cook it 1 min more.  I will definitely be serving this when I have company over for dinner and to make it easier, I will refrigerate the batter so that all I have to do is pop it in the oven when we are finished eating.",

I made the batter the day before a dinner party, put it in the ramekins and just refrigerated the whole kit and caboodle until dishes were being cleared and coffee was being made at dinner the next night. Took it right from the fridge, put it in the oven and out came an amazing, chocolatey decadence. Oohs and ahhhs from all. It was a a TOTAL success and I will definitely make it again.",
