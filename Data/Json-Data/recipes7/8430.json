This recipe brings out the natural flavor sand sweetness of the fruit and was neither too runny nor too thick and pasty. I will admit though that I used commercial pie crusts and didn't do the sugar wash on bottom crust it didn't seem necessary. I also used equal parts raspberries and blueberries to make a heaping 4 cups of fruit and a scant 3/4 cups of sugar. I'm confidant though this would be just as good if I'd followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make this again.",
