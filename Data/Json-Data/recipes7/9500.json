Crushing the Oreos is definitely not a requirement and I actually like it better when the Oreos are just laid down under the brownie. If you forgot the Oreos like I did the first few times making it it's perfectly fine with just the chocolate chip cookie and the brownie. My sister added chocolate chips sprinkled on top of the brownie layer for just that much more chocolate and the melty quality of the chips work best when the slutty brownies were served hot. If you're serving hot with ice cream is the best way to go but if you want nice squares refrigerating for about half an hour and then cutting helps.",

They are a joy to eat especially after working up a sweat just before convincing your teacher that an alien ate your homework. They are maybe the best brownies you will ever eat they are so good. Use this easy recipe and you will have a quick easy recipe that you can serve for any party potluck dessert (they re especially good with ice cream) or just give them to your new neighbors if you have some new neighbors. I made them extra chocolate-y by adding chocolate chips and bars. I also tried giving it kind of a fizz by adding Coca-Cola or Dr.Pepper. I even tried making them taste like Godiva chocolates by adding some white chocolate too. I have entered these in many brownie contests and won every single time. The judges said they were far above all the other recipes. I enjoyed selling them door to door and I came out with an average of 12.75 a day. Sometimes I just whip up a normal batch to just snack on. It s a joy to have them plain and simple even though they re good with changes. I made them low-fat and they are still good. Just add less fat and chocolate. They have great potential and good credentials and they will please every time. I hope everybody gives this good ratings and they are better than other brownies because they have caramel cookie layer and crushed oreos. I am really glad I have this recipe so here is the recipe i love that i",
