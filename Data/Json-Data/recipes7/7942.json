When I made this in the spring and the blueberries were very sweet, 2 cups of sugar was just right for my family.  When I made a batch later in the summer when the blueberries were a little tart, I found mixing tart cooking apples (Gala, Granny Smith) and some sweet apples (Honeycrisp and Fuji) to help make it naturally sweet. My advice is start with 2 cups sugar and add small amounts (1/4 cup) at a time to reach the sweetness you and your family will enjoy.  I would also like to thank the Allrecipes.com kitchen staff for adding the directions on canning to my recipe.",
