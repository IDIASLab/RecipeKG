So my review is for the cake part - it is a very lovely cake for cupcakes - not overly sweet (I find many cupcake recipes to be sickeningly sweet) moist flavorful. I have made it topped with a semi-sweet orange cream cheese frosting dusted with grated dark chocolate and it was perfection! Hopefully one of these days I'll get around to the pistachio frosting.",
