Personally didn't care for using lemon juice for the dressing instead of the traditional rice vinegar or substitute of white wine vinegar so in the future for a touch of lemon flavor for others who might want it will serve garnished with a lemon wedge. Oh, to save peeling time I used English cucumbers which have a very nice thin skin :-)",

I used baby seedless cucumbers and sliced them with a mandoline slicer. I skipped step 1 and didn't peel or deseed and simple sliced them. I didn't let them sit salted first. No, I just tossed the dressing with the sliced cucumbers and tossed in the sesame seeds and let this sit in the refrigerator for two days before eating it. I loved this! I thought it needed something a little more though like onion to take this up a notch. It is a solid recipe as written though. I did cut this down to use 2 cucumbers and it made plenty for 2 servings. This had a sweet and tangy flavor. A little sour but not really. More mild and really really good. I'll happily fix this again.",
