And it did! I just added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground allspice, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I also used leftover pumpkin puree that I had made up for a pumpkin pie rather than a can. If you which to use \"fresh pumpkin\" 15oz was just about two cups worth. If not can is fine, I just had extra. And no the extra water in the puree did not  make the muffins \"soupy.\"  Finally I substituted 1 cup chocolate chips with 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup craisins simply because my boyfriend is not a big fan of chocolate.  I hope this helps! I will be making another batch very soon! Oh and PS: If you are using deep \"muffin tins\" vs. Shallow cupcake tins that fit cup cake paper you may have to double the cooking time.",
