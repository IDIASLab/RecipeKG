I might even leave out the sugar next time. I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts bc that's what i had on hand and it turned out really good. I didn't have to use all the dressing either - I probably ended up using 2/3 of it and the salad was plenty moist with that amount. I will use the remainder of the dressing for something else.

I think it has potential but was quite disappointed with the results after spending so much time. 1) 2.5 cups of broth is too much for 1 cup farro. It came out slimy and with extra liquid that had to be drained off. I should have followed other recipes I have that say 1 to 2. 2) Why the weird directions of boiling 10 minutes then sit for 30. Wish I'd just made it normally and boiled for 25 minutes. 3) There's too much dressing overall and too large a ratio of oil and sugar (syrup) to make this a healthy option which most people bothering to cook farro probably care about. I think it would work though with less of both 4) Lastly didn't think the flavors were amazing together just okay. Maybe needs some other major ingredient. As it is it's like eating wet farro with a tiny bit of fruit sprinkled in.",
