I normally make buttermilk waffles for my family on the weekend. I was out of eggs and milk, so I searched for a vegan recipe.  My daughter and I normally eat vegan breakfast and lunch. So the real test were the guys.  My little one asked for seconds! It was really easy and quick to assemble. I added some pecans/chocolate chips to a few. Of course, the possibilities are endless. I will definitely make these again!",
