The trickiest thing about this recipe is with the avocado purchase. You don't want one too firm but it has to be firm enough to hold up to the egg wash and breading process so avoid ones that are too ripe. Something important I want to point out. It looks like there was some confusion for the temp on the air fryer. Going off of her previous recipes I've made, the 200 degrees she calls for is celsius. For fahrenheit  you'll want to do 400 degrees. That is what I did and they were perfect. Thanks Bren for another great recipe!",
