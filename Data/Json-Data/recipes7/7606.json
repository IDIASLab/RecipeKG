The only difference was that I used a pre-blend of gluten-free flour (Pamela's- really good and easy to use).  I was curious about no baking soda, but I did not add it and the brownies came out thick and fudgy. The batter looked exactly the same when it came out of the oven as it did when it went in!  I will definitely make these again and might add baking soda just to satisfy my curiosity...  UPDATE-  I did add baking soda the second time I made these.  They puffed way up and then fell when they came out of the oven.  This time the brownies were much darker and not as dense, much more the texture and color of a box brownie mix.  Thanks, Lindsay these are delicious either way!!",

                "reviewBody": "Thank you for this family recipe, Lindsay. My son wanted brownies (& ice cream) for his 10th birthday celebration. We are a gluten-free family and even though I love baking and do it quite often, I've never made GF brownies. So I searched online and found your recipe. It came out great! I made a few small changes: \n-I used a combination of coconut sugar and xylitol (birch bark sugar) and used about 1/8-1/4 cup less than the recipe called for.\n-I added about 1/4 cup buttermilk (this always makes baked goods really moist)\n-used sprouted brown rice flour instead of sorghum flour since that's what I had on hand. Sorghum flour is a sweeter rice flour and sprouted brown rice flour is more of a standard flour flavor. \n-I used a combo of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate chips since I didn't have enough semi-sweet.\n\nUsing less sugar and less sweet chocolate chips still made for plenty sweet brownies. They are so moist, fudgy and delicious. I will definitely make them again. I've already been asked to share the recipe with a friend and I already emailed it to her. Thanks again. Love this recipe.",

I don't care for the use of xanthan gum and by reading the other reviews mentioning that the batter seemed \"glob-like\" or \"sticky\" felt this was because of the gum and chose to omit it altogether. I used an 8X8 square baking dish (approx. 2 inches high) and they cooked evenly throughout in approximately 30 minutes. The end product was crumbly. I imagine this was due to the lack of any binders. I will definitely use this recipe again. The taste is in fact delicious just like a traditional brownie. Perhaps the next time I'll use some arrowroot or sweet rice flour to help bind more.
