I agree using applesauce is a healthy exchange but there is nothing wrong with butter as long as it is real butter and not margarine..

It is not a bad choice!!!",

I subbed applesauce for the 1/3 c butter for an even healthier muffin. I did use butter for the topping and regretted it because it soaked through the muffin and the cups were sitting in butter when I took them out of the oven. I will try applesauce for the topping next time. I will definitely make these again though. I'm trying hard to NOT eat them all right away. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
