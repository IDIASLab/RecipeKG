I went to three stores looking for it.. no where to be found. I know I have seen it before but not this time. I grabbed a cheap bottle of root beer poured 2 cups into a pot and cooked it down to a syrup. It worked great and its a lot cheaper than a bottle of extract... if you even able to find the stuff. These went over really well at church.. made the root beer fans very happy",
