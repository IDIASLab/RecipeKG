YAY!\nI made a streusel topping out of crushed biscoff cookies from the Tastebook.com post: \"Biscoff Banana Bread with Biscoff Cookie Streusel\"\nAnd I drizzled it with some melted caramels... \n\nThese things are so moist! I probably could have let them bake another couple minutes (I did about 23) but still tasty!",
