In my 2nd batch I did the same but used a small can of manderin oranges instead of mango. yum! Sorry this didn't work out for you Rachel. Yes the poms are an acquired taste I've been eating them for over 30 years....it's only now that they are getting popular. This recipe is MEANT to be quite spicy & crunchy....so you made it correctly. As per your suggestion to make it moe \"palatable\" for your desired taste removing the poms/spices etc. what you find is the original recipe found on the back of just about any bag of fresh cranberries. Maybe you can start from there then create something more to your liking.:) Use your imagination! That's where most fun recipes come from...\"basic\" guidelines plus your own \"special touch\". 11/6/10 A friend of mine just emailed me and gave me her version of my basic recipe! I haven't tried it yet but I will! She substituted lt. brown sugar for the white sugar and 1 cup of peeled fresh FIGS sliced in place of the poms. I just made a batch of this sauce for dinner tonight and tried it with apple cider in place of the OJ and 1 cup of chopped apples and pears. Oh my! Delish! This is basically a \"do what you want to it\" type of recipe. As long as the sugar and liquid stay the same as far as amts. it keeps it's consistancy. I would LOVE to hear how anyone else changes this up. Cooking is ALL about creativity and new ideas!",

My husband and I tasted it right after cooking and it was fine so perhaps I left the cinnamon sticks in too long? (It was about 24 hours total to serving time.) But the next day it was definitely different and it tasted like the cloves were too strong. I wanted to try using pomegranates in a cranberry sauce and this was the only recipe I found but they didn't add much in the end because the cranberry/clove taste was too strong. (Plus everyone that ate it said \"Oh no what is so crunchy in here? Are you supposed to eat that?\" but that's not the recipe's fault they don't know what a pomegranate is.) My suggestiong would be to skip the poms all together and cut back the spices and you've got a great sauce that I might try again.",
