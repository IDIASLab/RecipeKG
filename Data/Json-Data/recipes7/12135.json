I am writing this review because reading how others have made recipes work for them is my favorite part about allrecipes. I did not have any potatoes so I carmelized about a 1/2 onion in the oil before adding the mustard seed. I then followed the actual recipe. Please note that I used kosher salt not table salt. The end result was okay just a little too sweet and oily but this is likely because of the caramelized onion and lack of potato. I added same garam masala for some more spice and crushed crackers to soak up the excess oil. The end results were good. I will be making this again hopefully with the potato but I think I will keep the onion garam masala reduce the sugar and add the scallion mentioned in the first review. Thank you for posting this recipe",

Heated oil and mustard seed (mine was really old so not much flavor); added cauliflower and potato as directed but also added a medium onion cut up in chunks about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and about 1/2 Tablespoon (approx) of steakhouse seasoning (the grinder kind with chunks of garlic dried onion salt peppercorns etc) and a few shakes of CURRY powder (because I didn't have any turmeric). I also added a container of fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms. I think the extra onion and mushrooms helped balance out the oil. There was savory tangy and a hint of sweet without adding any sugar. My husband and I thought it was very flavorful. I served it with a lemon/pepper marinated turkey tenderloin and it was very good! Quick tasty sidedish!",

I ended up adding an equal amount of cumin as well. 2 stars as is but even with my tweaks I'd only give this dish a low 3. Sorry but I won't make this one again.",

Took out of pan put into a bowl and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  I can\u2019t say it was healthy, but it was delicious!  My husband commented that he really liked the cauliflower and was surprised when he discovered that there was potatoes in it.  I did over cook the potatoes a bit, but that might of added to it, not sure.  Looked for leftovers the next day and it was all gone.
