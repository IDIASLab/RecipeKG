I've made it twice: once for me, and once for the neighbors who gave me Fuyu persimmons from their tree.\n\nNote: 4 persimmons is not a good measure \u2014 it depends on the size. More accurately, use 2 lbs before peeling. Cut 6-8 thin whole slices, enough to cover the top of the cake. Chop and blend the remaining persimmons until coarse pulp.\n\nI substituted the individual spices for 1.5 tsp Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice mix, which includes cinnamon, ginger, lemon peel, nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom. I also increased the fresh lemon zest to 1 full tsp. Definitely bumped up the flavor.\n\nBe sure the center of the cake is completely cooked before removing or it will droop in the center. For me, that was about 40 minutes. (I made that mistake the fist time, but it was still delicious!)",
