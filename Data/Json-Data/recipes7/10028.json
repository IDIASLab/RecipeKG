Glad I did - it IS ridiculously easy!  The curd came out fantastic, with the lemon tartness coming through even better the second day.  The family and I all loved it, and I'll be making this again often, although with less sugar since it's a bit sweet for my personal preference (I don't normally have sugar, so don't go by my preference - stick to the recipe!)\n\nUpdate 4 weeks later: I just put my fourth batch of curd in the fridge (lime this time) and now tweak it to match my personal taste (only 6 Tbsp of sugar, 2 Tbsp of butter, and 2 to 3 Tbsp of zest).  This is now a staple in my house.",

Thought it might help others to know how many lemons to start with. Guess it also depends on how big they are, etc. Hope this helps!  MAKE this recipe!  You won't be disappointed.",

I used 4 zested lemons. I had no issues with it not thickening up. I did let it set overnight. I paired it with the Gold cake from this site and a simple glaze.

No need to mix the butter with the lemon eggs and sugar in a mixer first as I read else where. \n\nI used lime instead of lemon (a little less than 1/2 cup fresh squeezed key lime juice) and added a little water (too much actually, instead of 2/3 cup liquid I accidentally used 3/4 cup liquid).
