First up - the only company I'm aware of to make strawberry extract is Watkins - which fortunately I had a brand new bottle and thus why I made this recipe. I scaled the recipe back to make 8 servings and used regular cake tins. I found this cake to be dense and quite heavy which surprised me as the batter was remarkable light/airy and reminded me of a boxed cake mix. I couldn't detect a noticeable strawberry taste either. The cake took on a somewhat muted pink tone that wasn't so detectable after it had been baked frosted and cut. The recipe didn't suggest the cake be frosted but I used an all butter buttercream frosting and used a dark chocolate drizzle w/ fresh strawberries on top.",

My husband liked it though so I guess it wasn't that bad. I made the vanilla glaze (substituting strawberry extract for vanilla) for it and that was good. I also made mine in a 9X13 pan instead of springform pans and it was done in 30 minutes.",
