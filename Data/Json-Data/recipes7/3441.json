I chose it because the kids were starving and I didn't have 40 minutes to cook the other in the oven. Flipping this over was an accomplishment to behold. Next time I would use smaller pans to make it easier to flip. If you are looking for a light and thin German pancake...this is not it. However it is a great alternative to the regular pancake. Have fun with it. Add some vanilla or other favorite flavoring. Enjoy!",
