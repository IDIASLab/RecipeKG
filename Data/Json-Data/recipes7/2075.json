Most Squash soups want you to add cinnamon or sugars it just does not taste good to me and I almost gave up on thinking I would like Squash soup. I did do a couple things different because I did not have everything stated. I used 1 can Chicken Stock and then a can of water. I doubled the garlic as we love garlic. I thought it needed to be thicker so I cooked a large potato in the microwave then cut it up & added it to the soup. That did the trick. Next time I will know to add it with the squash. Oh I did add some fresh ground sea salt that hit the spot for us. I mashed everything with a potato masher. I did not add to the blender to make it smooth as after tasting it we liked the texture of how it turned out. It was great as it was & I was not going to add the Nutmeg & Yogurt (I used Sour Cream as I hate Yogurt) but I decided to try a small amount in a bowl to see how it would taste. Well needles to say but WOW!!! I did not think this could get any better but I was so wrong!!! It tied all the flavors together and it was so AWSOME!!! Again THANK YOU!!! THIS IS 10 STARS FOR US!",

I also added some spices; cayenne cumin and a little nutmeg. I did not use a blender or mixer but just let it simmer longer then mushed up the squash so it was still a little chunky. Before serving I threw in some beet greens as I needed to use them up a dollop of whole milk yogurt (Stoneyfield's \"cream top\" is so good!) and a dash of paprika and a basil leaf for presentation.
