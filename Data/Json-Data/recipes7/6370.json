You can use any type of milk. I usually make this bread when my milk is about to go sour. I like to use raw crystallized sugar in place of the white granulated sugar. My father likes to use buttermilk.",

The batter is a bit difficult to handle for it's stiff & sticky so it was very hard to transfer from the bowl to the baking pan even with a strong spatula. This bread is great on the day it's baked but by the next day it is all dried out and has no taste. I even tried freezing half of it on the day it was baked taking it out of the freezer on the day it would be consumed but that half was still dried out.",
