I didn't have any marinade so I melted butter and mixed it with a garlic and herb spice mix that I had already. Then I poured some into the holes that I stabbed into the meat. Also, when there's only about a 30 or 40 minutes of cooking time left (w/ a 1.5 lb roast)I start to slice the meat almost all the way through as if I were serving it. It was sitting in 1.5 inches of liquid, including the veggies so I spooned some of that on top after I sliced it. I think slicing the meat helped it cook a littler faster because pork always seems to take forever to cook for some reason.Easy and hopefully healthy but not sure how healthy my home made marinade was. I didn't even use the suggested gravy either, it was already moist and tasty enough.",
