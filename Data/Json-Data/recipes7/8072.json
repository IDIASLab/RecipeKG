It's odd there is no baking powder and that is likely why they are so dense: they don't rise. Finally I found the directions are unclear and missing steps. Overall I'd say to give the recipe a try but tweak it a bit and add baking soda to improve the texture.",

I found them to be super quick and easy to make. Great with a cup of coffee; I'll definitely try them again.",
