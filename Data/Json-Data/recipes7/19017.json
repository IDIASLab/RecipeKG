I followed the recipe religiously so it wasn't that I missed out added or changed an amount of any ingredient. It could be that the recipe is flawed but I think it more likely my novice baking skills are to blame. The lemon flavor didn't shine through and the cake turned out very dense. It sounded so good!",

Had to sub lemon juice for extract as I don't typically stock extract; seemed to work overall just milder lemon flavor. Will make again like this just with extra lemon juice & fresh zest next time.",
