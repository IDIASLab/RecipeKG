        "description": "If you're like most people, you've probably made the same turkey every Thanksgiving, year after year. Why not jazz up the flavor this time with a little pomegranate molasses? This Middle Eastern syrup is sweet but also deeply flavored with a little sourness. Think of it as a puckered-up version of balsamic vinegar. They're both irresistible. You can make your own pomegranate molasses (our recipe comes courtesy of Allrecipes reader, Flying Chef) or buy a bottle. Mix it with some sharp horseradish and mustard, as well as some chopped fresh sage for a familiar Thanksgiving flavor and you have a juicy, delicious turkey. Everyone will want seconds of this one.",
