I also used regular cucumbers from my garden that had lots of seeds so instead of using hothouse cucumbers and using salt to draw out water I scooped out regular cucumbers and it worked beautifully. I also did not put the avocado in because I was making a large portion to store in the fridge for later. AMAZING!:)",
