I love chicken satay with a peanut butter sauce but admittedly wondered if a cold peanut dressing would be the same. I need not have worried it was amazing. A nice change from the normal chicken salad recipes. I would not change anything here other than perhaps going 1.5X the chicken and doubling the dressing ( but just my taste ). Do try this!!!",

However, the noodles will get really soggy if they sit in this so I would suggest putting them in a small snack zip lock bag and lay on top.  you would definitely need a hardy lettuce or by the 6th day the lettuce is going to be wilted and slimy.    I would put the dressing in a small container and add when I'm ready to eat--this may have been in the directions, but I can't see them and type this. (smile)",
