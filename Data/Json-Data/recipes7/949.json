I have made poundcakes for years only using butter cake flour and sour cream. I was a bit surprised when I tried this recipe and it came out moist and delicious. I only made one slight adjustment I only added a 1/2 cup of milk instead of of 1 cup because the batter consistency without the liquid was already close to the usual poundcake consistency and it come out great.
