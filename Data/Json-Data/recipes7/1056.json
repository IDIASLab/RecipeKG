Then I substituted 4 ounces of the tomato sauce with hot salsa to the meat mixture.  Gave it some great flavour.  No one had mentioned how to easily get the cabbage leaves off.  I recomend cutting off the end of the cabbage head and blanching it in boiling water.  The leaves will soften and can be peeled off and rolled much easier.  This is also an important step if you want nice tender cabbage in the finished product.",

I found it helpful to soak the cabbage head in hot water for a few minutes to soften the leaves before trying to remove them, otherwise they ripped apart too easily.  My only complaint is that I ended up with a very watery sauce after I removed the rolls from the oven--I think water comes out of the cabbage leaves during cooking.  Next time I would omit water from the sauce and see if that helps.",

She said she would eat half a roll but ate the whole thing instead and now she wants the recipe!! Complete success!! I thought this recipe was a wonderful way to use leftover rice that I had already cooked. I used 2 cups of cooked brown rice in the filling along with the other ingredients as listed adding some garlic and parsley as well. In the sauce I took the advice of another reviewer and used all tomato sauce (because I didn't have tomato paste) instead of tomato paste and water mixed with tomato sauce. I was out of lemon juice so I substituted raw apple cider vinegar for that and added a bit more brown sugar to help the flavor. My whole family liked the filling and the sauce but only part of them were excited about the cabbage \"wrap\". So if you like cabbage you will LOVE this recipe!!",
