I have increased the sugar to create a little sweeter roll than Grandma used to make and replaced her refrigerated cake yeast with dried (easier availability). They are delicious served with Danish Lurpak&reg; butter (it's a little tangy, just like Grandma's)! Rolls can be made the night before and reheated, covered in foil, at 300 degrees F for about ten minutes.",
