I did grind up the oats in my food processor first to a flour or meal consistency only because one child will not eat anything with visible oats in it (even cookies, crazy, I know). And I only had on hand strawberry flavored sweetened applesauce, and it worked out great. We ate these with traditional syrup and also our typical \"strawberry syrup\" - which is just some frozen strawberries heated a couple minutes in microwave and then pureed in the blender, with a little sugar added if needed. I think it's the healthiest breakfast that both my boys will eat. :)",

The only thing I didn't do per recipe was I had to use oil because I didn't have applesauce on hand. They turned out great in my Belgium-style waffle iron. Also we sprinkled chocolate chips on top right out of the iron so they were melted when we were eating them. That was a yummy highlight for my kids. I would recommend eating with fruit and whip cream instead of syrup. It takes a lot of syrup to sweeten them and I prefer not to ruin such a nutrition packed waffle with so many calories.",
