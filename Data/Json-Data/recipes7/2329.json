(I'm not a big fan of cool whip) My biggest problem with this recipe is that the prep time is WAY off. Fortunately I chose to make the crepes ahead of time because it took at least 45 minutes just to cook the crepes. Add another 10 minutes to mix up the crepe batter plus time to chop all the fruit and mix up the \"sauce\" and you are looking at a good hour and a half of preparation before chilling time. I put the finished crepes on a plate covered with foil in the fridge overnight and they were good as new next morning. I also used frozen blueberries partially thawed and that worked well too. (Tip: 16 oz strawberries is about 2 C chopped)",

If you up the servings to 12 and use a 9x13 baking dish a canister of rolled out croissant dough will fit just about perfectly. (You will need 1 canister for each layer) Pinch and seal the perferated triangles so that it's one big rectangle of dough. Stab holes in it with a fork so that air vents out and the dough doesn't rise. If it matters I put holes in my dough about 5 or so minutes into baking it. I made this for a work luncheon and people seemed to be pleased with it.",
