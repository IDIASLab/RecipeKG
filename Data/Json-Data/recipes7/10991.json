I used the KA mixer on the Stir setting which was a lot easier than mixing by hand and it had a nice crumbly texture. Set the timer for 45 minutes and it was overdone which unfortunately resulted in a somewhat dry cake. It just wasn't as moist as I expected particularly since it had buttermilk in it. Granted this may be an issue with the temp of my oven but in the future I ll start checking for doneness at about 35 minutes. I also will add 1 tsp of baking powder as I would have liked more rise on the cake. On the positive side really enjoyed the flavor of this simple coffee cake and I will make it again.",
