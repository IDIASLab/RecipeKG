However, it all comes at a cost. The classic procedure is a little bothersome, since you need to make three separate components &ndash; a zabaione, a meringue, and whipped cream &ndash; so, I decided to simply use the eggs whole, and make a 'zabaringue.' I knew I wouldn't get as much volume, but I didn't care.",

Tonight I resolved to either thicken them scramble them or break something I did not follow the instructions exactly anymore. I simmered water in a skillet and placed a pyrex bowl in that and whisked and whisked. Not much happened for 20 minutes until I turned it up to high getting a full boil and even then it took another 5 minutes or so to thicken. I expect this batch will be good. The first batches tasted great but without thickened eggs they had poor texture not airy at all not much fun to eat. I would make this again if I could get it right and into the freezer within 20 minutes or so. But it took about an hour altogether tonight to do that.",
