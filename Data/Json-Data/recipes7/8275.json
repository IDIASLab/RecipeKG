It was by far the easiest and tastiest!  :)\n\nThe photo that accompanies this recipe is mine!  (The one with leaves in cinnamon, in case it changes.)\n\nI added a tablespoon of cornstarch (put in after the eggs) just b/c I always do with cheesecakes.  The cheesecake rose up so much out of the pan that I had to let it cool for quite a while before putting on the SC topping, then baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  I let it cool in the oven with the door open for two hours, then popped it in the fridge.  No cracks!  \n\nAlso, I tossed in some ground walnuts into the crust, as well as substituting about 2 Tablespoons of pure Maple Syrup for half of the white sugar in the crust.\n\nI serve my pumpkin cheesecakes with home made cinnamon whipped cream, ad it's a hit every year!!  (I always make extra b/c it goes with almost every other Thanksgiving dessert, too!) \n\nI've made sure to print off this recipe and put it in a special spot in my recipe box for next year!!",

I would also use less pumpkin which is very watery so could have made it runnier. the cake did rise above the pan while baking but never spilled over. once cooked it did drop enough to put the topping on which I loved. overall a great tasting cheesecake but some tweaking is needed.",
