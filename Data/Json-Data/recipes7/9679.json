I've been testing OF's at every Supper Clubs and bars for over 20 years--but decided to make my own after receiving a nice bottle of whiskey for my birthday.  I made this recipe (with 1C Sugar and 2C Brown Sugar) and I did mash the orange and cherries prior to steeping.  I used 1 part mix to 1:1 with a splash of Squirt soda... simply delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Of course I'm in Wisconsin so I have to try it with Brandy tomorrow night, but I expect the same excellent result.",
