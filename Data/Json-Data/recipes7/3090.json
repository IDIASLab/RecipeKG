I had bought some coconut milk for something..but couldn't remeber what for. So I came across this recipe and to my delight...this was. I did replace the sugar with a sub and it still worked out well. This made me happy happy as we at it hot. Eating it cold the next day. Not wise....I refrigerated the leftover portion from a double and well that didn't go over well trying to get it out of the bowl the next day. Note to all. Don't double the batch for leftovers. It gels so bad it's like Jello it won't spoon to dish out easily at all and the texture is not pleasing. I'll make this again. But only 1 batch and not 2. We won't keep the leftovers on this dish due to what happens when you refrigerate it. For a hot instant pudding this is it all the way. For a pudding to make and eat when cold....not so much.",
