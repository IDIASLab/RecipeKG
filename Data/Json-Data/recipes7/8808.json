Next time I will mix the wet ingredients first then add the dry ingredients a little at a time. The cookies were quite dry so I would have liked to use less flour but using this mixing method I didn't have the option. The recipe also doesn't call for the cookies to be flattened once on the cookie sheet.. since they are quite dry they will not flatten just from baking. I recommend either rolling them out and using cookie cutters or flattening the balls once on the cookie sheet. The cookies were a bit bland so I plan on using an egg white wash and sprinkling granulated sugar on them next time. And possibly adding a bit of lemon zest to the dough. Oh and I made just 1 less than 2 dozen cookies after rolling them into 1.5 inch balls.",

Then incorporated the egg and finally sifted in the dry ingredients. These cookies don\u2019t spread much so make sure they are flattened and shaped to the size you want them BEFORE you put them in.
