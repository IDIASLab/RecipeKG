I substituted 2 tbsp of corn starch for some of the flour to make it fluffier and less staunch. I know it's a shortcake, but we were in the mood for more \"cakey\" cake. I also used the light Karo syrup instead of the golden because it's what was on hand, and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and cornstarch into the glaze to make it slightly reminiscent of pumpkin pie, and thicker. I used a loaf pan and adjusted the temperature to 375 for 23 mins and it came out divine. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I had to add about 2-3 Tablespoons of milk to mine before it was even close to a \"firm dough\", but I am not known to be a precise measurer, so that is most likely my fault. Regardless, it turned out beautifully. I served with fresh sliced strawberries in sour cream/brown sugar. Heavenly!",

Either it needs more liquid to make it a \"firm dough\" Or it needs to be changed to something that specifies it is not a dough but more of a graham cracker crust consistency.
