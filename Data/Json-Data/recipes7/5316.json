Well it was and just as the submitter states - Why spend money on the seasonal flavored stuff when you can make your own?\" I punched up the spices a pit by adding some pumpkin pie spice and made it a little extra special by topping it off with a nice dollup of whipped cream. I dare say Dunkin' Donuts couldn't have done any better! Thanks for a really tasty and really simple recipe Monica!",

I wanted to try this different method today: However, after brewing, I could barely taste any \"pumpkin\" flavor in the coffee for the time spent. It mainly tastes like a \"lightly spiced coffee.\" So, if you want that extra pumpkin spice flavor, I would add the pumpkin spice, or add it to the cup in the manner I make it. The recipe also made more like 3 cups of coffee if you needed that extra cup in the morning.",

I was not a fan of the flavor but I'm sure experimenting will result in a good outcome",

We have a pour over coffee maker so I wanted to make sure the spices were at the bottom to spice the coffee. I found that overall it tasted a little on the watery side and the pumpkin spice was quite weak. I would suggest at least doubling the spice in this recipe if you are a pumpkin spice lover like myself. I went on to using this coffee to make a pumpkin spice latte.",
