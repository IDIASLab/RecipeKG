I kind of played with this recipe using white flour (no wheat flour) 1 apple instead of 2 and totally eliminated the sugar substitute as I really didn't want 'sweet'. I added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1 tsp of chicken bullion. Thanks jjsMA.. really appreciated your recipe.. even though I messed with it to suit my needs..",
