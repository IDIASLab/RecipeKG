        "description": "This soup is great for a cold fall day. I don't often cook using recipes so all amounts are my best guess but feel free to experiment - this recipe is great no matter what I seem to do with it.  One helpful hint with the squash: It is really hard to peel so I do not peel it but instead roast it and then scoop the insides out into the soup. It's much easier that way! Serve topped with blue cheese crumbles and crusty bread on the side.",
