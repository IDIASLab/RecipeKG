This recipe was quite good but I added serai (lemon grass) daun jeruk (lime leaves) & kemiri (candle nuts) to the sauce & a little more cuka (vinegar). That's the way I've always seen it made and Indonesian recipes can vary a lot from area to area. Pretty good although I had to use half the chili peppers recommended we ate everything pretty fast. It's not quite the flavor I'm used to but still delicious. Terima kasih until resep ini. Tolong publish resep untuk kentang balado juga Ibu:-)",
