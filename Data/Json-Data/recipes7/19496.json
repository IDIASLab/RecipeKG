It's beautiful to knead it bakes up wonderfully tastes fantastic and has the best texture! The only things I did differently was to make this all by hand (I used a good ol' fashioned wooden spoon) instead of using a mixer and used ground ginger in place of mace. Oh and I needed 4 tbsps of melted butter to dunk all of the dough balls into as well--2 tbsps just wasn't enough. If I had one minor thing I'd do next time it would be to add a lemony glaze over the top when it's done baking. While there is lemon flavor through the bread I felt it could use just a touch more (I love lemon though). Highly highly recommend making this! I know I'll be making it again for sure! (Maybe with some blueberries in it next time too!)",
