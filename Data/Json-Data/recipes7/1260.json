This needed at least 50 minutes at 350 not 25 as written in the recipe. I will certainly make this again but with notes for different cooking times. I might also try nutmeg instead of the cinnamon- nutmeg is fabulous with pears! Also I did not have pear brandy. I substituted Caramel Liquor- yum! Regular brandy would also be a substitute- although I'll be keeping my eyes open for pear brandy.",

I didn't do it exactly the way the recipe said but overall it still worked out. I used french bread cut up in cubes or bite size pieces. I used two cans of sliced pears in thier juices because the pears at the supermarket were not ripe at all and I needed them that day. Then I used the juice from the can because I did not have enough time to go get pear brandy. I'm making this again and will try with the brandy but other than that enjoyed alot. Oh and the crumb mixture is goooood. It taste like you are eating a crumb coffe cake.",

If you make the recipe as written be prepared to use a larger dish. I did not use a water bath although I did cover as directed and it seemed to bake fine.
