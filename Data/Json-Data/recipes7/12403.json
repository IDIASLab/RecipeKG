WOW This is soooo good. The only thing I did different was to add a cut up calamondin orange from my little tree to add a little extra flavor. Next time I might add several because that was delicious once candied as well. Also I think I didn't cook it long enough once the syrup was cooked down because I did have to leave the sugared pieces in my oven overnight with the light on to dehydrate it a little as some were a little too juicy. Had my son try a piece of the watermelon without telling him what it was. He thought it was some type of butter candy and when he found out what it was he told me I should make it and sell it. For some reason maybe the salt it has almost a buttery flavor. Absolutely delicious and will definitely make again.",

If I was to make this again (which I doubt I will) I would add some sort of flavoring--either more lemon grass or something else. And less sugar!",
