At the very least I can boil longer to achieve greater thickness and evap some water. I added homemade pure vanilla extract 1/2 stick cinnamon (while cooking) and a couple tbs real maple syrup for flavor (didn't have any extract).",

This made enough to fill just over half of a plastic syrup bottle. To get the butter flavored taste that my kids and husband like, I added a teaspoon of butter flavoring. I also upped the maple flavoring to a full teaspoon. Don't go into this recipe expecting real maple syrup. That's not what this is. My mom made this same recipe for us when we were kids only because she didn't want to pay for processed maple syrup AND we'll, the homemade syrup just tastes better. It's not the real deal, but if you need a maple syrup in a pinch, this works just fine. NOTE: Because I've made homemade pancake syrup before, I suggest you cook this recipe a little longer to thicken it up a bit. Three minutes is not enough for me, just under ten minutes was just right for me.",

The first day I found the vanilla a little overpowering and wondered if it is really necessary. The second day the flavours had meshed and it was amazing. The fate of the vanilla in this recipe was saved. However I agree with France (from Quebec) that this is good enough to fool most -- (I'm from Ontario so it would fool me) wink wink -- Possible crystalization concerned me but I was prepared to re-heat the syrup to liquify the sugar again; however I put it in an old syrup bottle and -- No Problem! -- The container must be airtight! Those who thought it was too sweet probably have never had pure maple syrup extracted from Maple Tree sap. It is sooooo sweet that it makes your teeth hurt. (They make little candies out of it so the four year old who thought it was candy paid this recipe the highest compliment!). If you want it thicker add a little more brown sugar. For an Ontario \"girl\" who likes the price this is AMAZING! No more buying syrup for me! Thanks Leetah!",
