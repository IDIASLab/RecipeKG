We used boneless skinless chicken breasts organic chicken broth instead of apple cider no pumpkin pie spice and a lot more seasoning on the chicken. The chicken cooked in about 55 minutes without taking the time to try to brown the chicken (no skin). The veggies were delicious though the potatoes were undercooked at 55 minutes when the chicken breasts were done. Everything else was tasty! Overall a good recipe to get an idea--just run with it yourself especially when seasoning the chicken.",
