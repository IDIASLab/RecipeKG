Because I used more parsnips I upped other ingredients but I found that I used much more chicken broth than the recipe called for - it was very thick. I used fresh ginger instead of ground and more garlic and cayenne pepper (we love garlicy spicy food). For garnish being that we didn't have hazelnuts and cranberries in the house I sauteed sultanas and walnuts in a touch of butter.. it was fabulous! Thanks for this recipe!",

Pan roasting the parsnips made them incredibly sweet. I could have skipped the sugar but I did add extra cayenne to counter that a bit. I also made this a SUPER LIGHT version by using unsweetened almond milk no butter and homemade vegi broth. The cranberries are A MUST as they add the bitter depth this soup lacks while the toasted hazelnuts add fantastic texture and depth. Like other reviewers I chose to thin this out quite a bit but the bf liked it thick ( I guess it depends on personal preference so I won't knock off a star for that!)",
