Therefore, I prepared this exactly as written - and it was perfect, just as I had anticipated it would be.  My only criticism, and the only thing I did differently, was that the recipe calls for round steak, which I don't think is suited for this style of cooking.  I used a New York strip steak, but tenderloin or sirloin would have worked well too.  The ingredients in the marinade are so traditional and so key to the dish  that I don't really see how you could make any changes and get a fair result.  This was just delicious and made hubs and I members of \"the clean plate club.\"  Just a tip - if you partially freeze the steak for a half hour or so until semi-firm you will find this so much easier to cut into the thin slice so necessary for this style of cooking.",

Before preparing the recipe, rinse the beef off twice and dry on paper towels.  Other than that difference,  I followed the recipe to a T.  Next time might add a few dried chilies, because I like the heat, but the sauce is wonderful!",

I followed the cooking instructions, but I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I substituted, using what I had on hand.   I didn't have oyster sauce or sherry, so I used hoisin and extra amounts of soy sauce, and I substituted brown sugar for the white - just because.   Instead of fresh, I used powdered ginger, onion, and garlic, which I added to the marinade.   I marinated the meat for 2 hours, which was good - but overnight would be better.   I used the Normandy frozen veggie blend (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) from Sam's and added a large sweet onion.   I don't measure anything - just guesstimate, dump, and taste-test until it suits me.  It turned out very tasty!   I'll make this version as written when I have all the ingredients - but, I'll be doing my own version again too!    If this one is half as good as mine, I'll be happy happy!    ",
