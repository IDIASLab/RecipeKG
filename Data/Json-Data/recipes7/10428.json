I made 8 regular sized cupcakes with the recipe which I followed most of it except for butter buttekrill replaced with plain fresh milk and red colouring with strawberry emulco (paste). It tasted very nice with the paste. I had to add 2 tbps to get the colour I liked and added a little less than 2-thirds of sugar. I liked the frosting for awhile until it deflates after awhile. I put the rest in the fridge and hope that it'll be moist.",
