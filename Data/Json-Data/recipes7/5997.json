I've perfected it to our liking with the following changes:\nBake @350 for 55 minutes\ncover with foil and bake an additional 10 minutes.

I substituted shortening for the butter (only because I didn't have any). I added the dry ingredients at the same time as the bananas and apples. Then I used 2 bread pans and 6 mini loaf pans (2 x 4 inch). I also sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon on top (just a little). I then baked in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes (mini loaves) and 45 minutes (for regular size loaves). These turned out moist (yet cooked through) and delicious! My kids asked for second helpings. Will definitely make again!",

The baker is instructed to combine the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another bowl, but is never told to mix the two together.  The loaf pans called for (7x3 inches) are too small.  I used 8x4 inch pans and they nearly overflowed. The baking time, as others have noted, is off and the temperature is too low. Like others, I increased both time and temperature. The foil simply stuck to the top of the loaves and tried to take the banana slices with it when removed. Even after baking for what seemed like an eternity AND passing the toothpick test, the bread was gooey on the bottom after cooling and cutting. But it tasted great.",

I used one 8\" x 4\" loaf pan and one larger and still thought \"Hmm that's a lot of batter.\" Half an hour later when my smoke detector went off I opened the oven to find a mess of batter and topping on the floor of the oven. They've been in an hour now and have at least half an hour to go. I set the temp at 350 from the beginning because 325 seemed too low for a quick bread and I wish I'd known to either reduce the entire recipe by a third or make 3 loaves.",
