Were I to make this again I would reduce the almond extract by half or eliminate it altogether. After all this is called Vanilla Cherry Ice Cream not Almond Cherry Ice Cream. I like my ice cream rich so as I always do I used 2 c. heavy cream 1 c. half and half and added two eggs. Beat the eggs for 1-2 minutes gradually add the sugar beat another minute to dissolve the sugar then add cream half and half and flavoring. I used frozen Door County cherries which I thawed quartered and added during the last few minutes of churning. Rich velvety smooth mouth feel and intensely cherry. Definitely worth a repeat but definitely with reducing the amount of almond extract.",

I had 1 lbs of fresh bing sweet cherries pitted half of it rough chopped the other sliced in halves. After reading others review I omitted the almond extract. I used 1 vanilla bean spilt lenghwise. TIP: Please use vanilla beans if you can! They make such a difference! Once combined I chilled everything before making the ice cream about 4 hours or so. Took 30 minutes to make in the ice cream maker and it was so creamy rich and smooth which is perfect on a hot day. I loved the frozen cherries I bit into. I am glad I left out the almond extract. This turned out fantastic. I just kept on eating and eating. I would definitely make this again but without the almond extract and using real vanilla bean! UPDATE 08/12/11: Made this again but with 2 cups of Maraschino Cherries. I rough chopped some and halved the others. So super delicious! Sweet juicy and \"candy\" like cherries swirled in vanilla ice cream. My family ate this entire recipe up in one night! Going to make this again. note-if you decide to try it this way know that the red maraschino juice will turn the milk/cream mixture a pinkish red color. Also used \"Sweetened Whipped Cream \" from this site to top it off.",
