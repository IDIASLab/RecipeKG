I scaled the servings down to 3 and used fresh pineapple I chopped in the food processor and just brown sugar instead of white.  recipe doesn't say what size dish, so I used 4 baking crocks and baked at time and temp directed.  Turned out very yummy, thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Review in 2nd paragraph.  Bread pudding began as a practical use for putting dried up bread stuffs to use. The eggs and milk are really meant to add moisture back to the bread but the benefit is that the pudding/cake ends up in a delicious moist state.  Comfort food to the MAX.  If you simply keep to dry to moist ingredients in the same ratio as this recipe lays out you are free to toss in whatever flavor combos you like...or you have on hand!  You could add leftover rice or any fruits you like or cooked quinoa or soaked Chia seeds. Fresh ground flax seeds would add a delightful nutty flavor.   Poppy seeds and chopped oranges or lemons would be fun.  Just use the basics and have fun.   \n\n This is a very good pudding. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c (just my preference--not that there is anything wrong with the original amount)  I made mine from a cinnamon/raisin bread and a soft wheat combination.  I added moist chopped prunes (btw 1/2 c and 3/4).  I also tipped in shot of rum to anchor the flavor...the alcohol bakes out so there is no need for the breath-alizer.  OH... and I made two.  I let the first one sit for about 10 minutes before I baked and the second one went in right away.  The second one raised higher and was lighter so don't let it sit. Yum.  Next time I feel ambitious I will make a baked custard and serve them together.",

Keeping a bread pudding moist while holding temp for several hours does not come naturally but can be done... with a load of butter and good amount of fruit. We cut up a whole large challah and baked the cubes slightly to make sure they were dried and hard. This is presumably about double the quantity of bread listed in this recipe. To make the custard we used 7 medium eggs a full cup of walnuts a full cup of raisins 3.5 sticks of butter 1 cup of powdered sugar and basically an entire 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (not crushed). We went one layer of bread followed by a well distributed layer of custard and then did another layer on top of that the same way. Then we topped it all with fresh pineapple chunks (not canned) and dusted those with brown sugar. It was awesome.",
