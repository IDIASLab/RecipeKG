But for those of you who think you might like to try to make it, have plenty of bowls on hand.  My kitchen wasn't quite ready for these!  They're a bit tricky to slide off the pan to flip - my second pancake flipped over gooey side down so it was a little challenging.\n\nI looked online and saw that it's normally served cut up into diamond shapes along side a sauce of some kind.  I think it would taste great with cinnamon and apples or caramelized pecans.  It's very fluffy, light, not as eggy as I expected it to be.  I think it should have cooked a little bit longer but I'm not sure - no frame of reference.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a bit of a challenge!",
