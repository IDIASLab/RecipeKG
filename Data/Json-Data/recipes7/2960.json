The only thing I would do differently next time is to drain the liquid from the persimmon puree, just like you would for fresh pumpkin puree before making a pie/pumpkin cheesecake.  If you are not familiar with that, just line a collander/strainer with 2-3 sheets of good quality paper towell or cheesecloth and let sit in another bowl over night.  You'll be surprised to see the amount of liquid that has drained out into the \"catch\" bowl.  The cheesecake will turn out much better after draining the excess liquid.",

I disagree with the reviewers who said that it was too runny or didn't have enough persimmon taste. I didn't strain my persimmon puree at all and my cheesecake had the perfect creamy texture and a whole lot of persimmon taste. Since I used a crushed gingersnap cookie crust I omitted the ginger in the cake and used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead. I also didn't do the sour cream topping. Instead I served it with fresh whipped cream. Awesome cheesecake. Can't wait to serve it to friends.",
