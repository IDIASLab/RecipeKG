I would also mix all the ingredients together before pouring them into the bread -- otherwise you're likely to break down the bread completely .-- so you get mush.  I like the crusts also because that helps to keep it from compacting down too much -- just make sure to soak bread long enough to absorb the liquids.",

I made ahead and stored in frig until my dinner party. I think key is to cook in rectangular pan as recommended- and don't overcook. I served with fresh whipped cream with vanilla extract mixed in AND ice cream on other side.  I wish I had saved some pecans to garnish the top- or pan caramelized pecans for the top.  Maybe that would have been too over the top- lol. Major hit of a dinner party. I think would easily serve 8-12 people+. I wish I had taken a photo!  Ps- I plumped the raisins in a tablespoon of hot water with vanilla extract- zapped in microwave on very low a minute.",
