Instead of rolling each piece in the sugar put some sugar in a bag add some fruit jellies shake and they ll be quickly (and easily) coated. Although pina colada is still my favorite flavor I wanted some multi-color jellies so I used four Jell-O flavors: pineapple (for the pina colada) lime grape and strawberry banana (omitting the coconut extract and lime juice on all but the pineapple). Also instead of cutting into squares I used small cookie cutters to make them more decorative. UPDATE 2.6.17 Made a new flavor using raspberry Jell-O and raspberry extracts really tasty!",

I also never change recipes however I did a ton of testing and came up with some wonderful tweaks. I always make a double batch using a 9x13 glass pan. So instead of trying to find oils and keeping them fresh and on hand I found adding correlating kool aid flavors to the mix pumps the flavors just right. 1 pack per double batch. I also add 1 extra pack of gelatin per double batch. Not as sticky to handle and come out with the consistancy of chuckles candy. Coat the top of your already set candy in the dish before you even take it out. Super fun to make great tasting candy. I always use miniature cutters. Good luck with these little gems.",
