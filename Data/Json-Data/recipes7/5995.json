Store-bought apple juice is tasty, but it has a strong, distinct flavor with almost a hint of bitterness. To those with sensitive palates, it can be a little strong at times. Homemade juice, however, tastes surprisingly different as it is lighter and pleasantly sweet without the kick. Besides using a juicer, this is a super-easy way of making apple juice.",

It honestly, tasted like what it was water, sugar, and tart apple peels. Making homemade apple juice or cider can be done very easily with a small counter top juicer. It tastes so much better than the store if you have not tried it. Plus, it is just pure apples. The whole point of apple juice, if it is good, is it doesn't need any sugar. I just thought I would test this recipe because I had some peels and apple cores from an apple tart recipe. I guess my apple scraps will continue to go into the compost pile as usual.",

I ended up leaving the pot to sit overnight and it was like slightly diluted juice in the morning. I'll make this again but with a higher ratio of peel to water for a really appple-ey flavour.",

Of course that may have just been because of the apples I was using (red delicious) and will vary from apple to apple and time of the year. Ours also got a much rosier color than that of the one displayed in the picture which was very pretty in our pitcher at our fall party.;) Hope this helps!",

I did the 5 cups of water & reduced the sugar to about 1/4 cup (as these apples tend to be very sweet already).  I cooked the peels & cores on high for about 45 mins & then strained everything from the juice several times in order to get the juice as pure as possible. Then I added the sugar and mixed until dissolved & let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to cool.  I then poured over ice & served it to my family who all loved it as much as I did! We do the whole apple picking thing every year as a family & I make homemade applesauce & pies & usually throw all the cores & peels away....well no more! Going forward I will be using them to make this delicious apple juice for my family! ????",
