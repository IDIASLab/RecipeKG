It was difficult to find dried blueberries I don't shop at the right stores apparently so I used blueberry juice infused cranberries (store-bought). The color pattern was not red-white- blue like I anticipated. For my cookies the color scheme looked like a typical golden brown of a sugar cookie wiht the dark read of the cranberries coming through... the white chocolate was kinda small to see. I did add the 1/2 tsp of vanilla as suggested before. Overall the coookies tasted great!! The juice from berries kept the cookies very moist and aromatic. The dough was easy to handle and I even mixed it my hand. The cookies once cooled just slide off the cookie sheets. The cookies are very filling and tasty. The cookie consistency was kind of flakey which made for an interesting texture contrast compared to the fruit not like a typical hard shortbread cookie. I don't have much experience baking as this was only my 4th batch and 4th recipe to try but I would make these again.",
