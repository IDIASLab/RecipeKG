                "reviewBody": "I couldn't believe it but this bread really is great no matter how you slice it.  I've made numbers of recipes over the years and haven't found one like this.  I've made three loaves of this recipe so far and each has been delicious.  The first attempt was by the book, so-to-speak, except I use fresh yeast (between 18-20 grams) because dry yeast is not available to me and white rice flour.  Second attempt I subbed half white half brown rice for the rice flour but maintained the other types of flours/starches and topped with buckwheat, brown rice and millet flakes.  Third attempt (the one in my picture) 1/2 white and 1/2 brown as well as tapioca for corn starch and guar gum (equivalent doses) for the xanthan (ran out of a few things).  In the second and third attempt I used 2 TBSP of low fat powdered milk and it has a fluffier texture to it and tossed some sesame seeds on top.  Will continue to use this third recipe.  Also, I never used an electric mixer.  All done by hand, much easier I think.  For those who weigh:  181 grams rice flour (my brown and white rice flours weigh about the same)+70 grams sorghum+75grams potato starch+63 grams tapioca.  The conversions on this site seem to go by volume not weight.  Definitely a keeper for basic bread recipe.  Toasted, sandwiches or just plain, simply a winner!  Thanks to Christy.",

I stronly suggest the use of a stand mixer with the bread blade since gluten free dough is much more sticky than traditional yeast bread doughs. \nThe bread holds up very well for sandwiches and makes a wonderful toast for breakfast.

It felt wet and it was just gross. So this was my first attempt ever making Gluten Free bread because I've been trying to get a feel for baking again.  Well, I can tell you this recipe is worth a shot. Most people who have celiac are allergic to soy and diary, so this was nice because I didn't have to try and sub anything. I made this bread and I only added baking powder, 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp. My daughter and I (GF) thought this was great and so good. It doesn't look like normal bread dough, it has a very wet look. Don't mess with it. I'll never buy bread again.",

It came out GREAT! Sliced and froze individual slices wrapped in wax paper. ****I just made it for about the 20th time and substituted tapioca flour for the sorghum (only because I was almost out) and it resulted in an even softer, spongier slice :D",

                "reviewBody": "This has the look and texture of the gluten free breads I have tasted such as Udi's brand. It is just slightly more dense. For being homemade. I guess I just expected something so much better. A year or so ago I decided to test gluten or wheat free baked goods to see how they would turn out. I found that despite the wheat not being included they still had tons of starch eggs butter and sugar. Sometimes at rates much higher than regular white or whole grain bread. This bread was no exception. It was super easy to make as no hand kneading or shaping is needed. Though like most gluten free breads I find it very rich and almost too sweet tasting. Definitely not like what I know as regular sandwich bread. This one was so sweet it almost reminded me of a mix between bread and a low sugar pound cake or as another reviewer put it closer to a very sweet \"beer bread.\" I thought the amount of sugar seemed excessive. I liked the crunch it had. However I think that was due to blending rice in my Vitamix grain container to make rice flour. I was just trying to use up sorghum flour potato starch and some xanthum gum. I bought these ingredients solely to test gluten free recipes as I only seem to see these ingredients in them and they do have a shelf life. I would definitely not recommend this recipe to someone that eats regular wheat bread but possibly to someone gluten or wheat intolerant to save some money. Udis & similar brands run about 5.00 a loaf. I got 18 slices total.",
