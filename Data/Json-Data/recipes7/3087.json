My hubby loves grainy brown so I spread some on the dough before putting the meat mix on. We also sprinkled some mozzarella and cheddar cheese on the meat mix before rolling up the log. We both agree that the dough is wonderful. Held its shape well. I used a older pan....but didn't grease it enough and the pinwheels stuck slightly but still held their shape. We are thinking this might be good with a beef/mushroom gravy type sauce to put over them. I'm also toying with trying to make individual appetizer size wheels. Thank you for a great Steeler Sunday meal. Was in a half hour before kick off and we were eating mid way into the first quarter.",
