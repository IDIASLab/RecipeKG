First, I used all unsalted butter - not margarine or salted butter.  Next, I double the amount of almond extract because I really wanted that flavor to shine through and 1 tsp just wasn't enough.  Lastly, I had to add almost an additional cup of confectioner's sugar to the frosting because it was way too loose.  In addition to my changes, I would definitely change the caramel recipe the next time around - it's too greasy.  Instead I would make a \"real\" wet caramel (water and sugar) and omit any butter.  To finish them, I topped them with slivered almonds and a sprinkle of fleur de sel.  While I did make some changes, these cupcakes are sinfully good and I will definitely make them again.",

In doing so I reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp & added 1/2 tsp baking soda. I used margarine & I must say the cupcakes I ended up with are the springiest moist cupcakes Ive ever had/felt! (I am in love with their texture!) I followed the caramel recipe to a T & I think I may have not let it thicken enough because when I poured in the heavy cream I ended up with a rather thin liquid looking nothing like honey. So I decided to half the buttercream recipe since I obviously botched the caramel. I beat 1/2 cup salted butter with 1 cup powdered sugar until creamy and slowly poured a\"little\" of the caramel liquid in added more sugar & repeated a couple times until the flavor & consistency were there. I dont think I even used half of my caramel mixture. Then I beat until it was fluffy & sprinkled a bit of sea salt on top after frosting each cupcake. I loved the way these turned out!",

I'm glad I didn't double the caramel! There is a ton left over, and I dipped the tops of each cupcake in the caramel, and then drizzled it over frosting. I didn't have enough frosting for all of my cupcakes (maybe 6 aren't frosted) so I poked holes in them with a fork and applied a thick layer of the caramel. Everything is very tasty. I will definitely be making this again.\n\nOnly adjustments I made were using Agave Nectar instead of corn syrup (I didn't have any) and I used an extra tsp of almond extract to intensify the almond flavor.

It wasn't runny or loose like other reviews stated I actually put in some whipping cream to make it a tad softer! Make sure you taste while you go on the frosting. I think if I put in ALL of the carmel it would have been way too strong. Also when making the carmel just put in the cream a little at a time just because it says half a cup doesn't mean you should just throw it in there. Go a little at a time to get the right consistency and it'll turn out perfect!",

You have to do some adjusting to make it more salty or sweet depending on what result you are looking for. I highly suggest as others did that you cut down on the butter for the frosting as it will make it more thin and greasy. The extra powdered sugar is helpful but you may need to add an extra pinch of salt to even out the sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!",
