Instead of plain water I used a half cup brewed unsweetened honey vanilla white chai and I added about a half teaspoon of dried lemon peel and a half teaspoon nutmeg. I did soak my raisins in the hot chai for about twenty minutes to plump them up. These took 20 minutes at 350 and wow do they smell amazing! I will be making these again for sure but when I do I'll use my changes and either add double the raisins or add in a cup or so of Hershey's cinnamon chips. I'd add a little more liquid next time too or bake a minute or two less. They were just a touch dry. The flavor? Amazing. Great recipe easily bendable for small personal changes. NOTE: I did use almost all organic ingredients. I think that helped the quality of the muffin immensely.",
