        "description": "Homemade eggnog is rich, extravagant, irresistible. But the ingredients - heavy cream, raw eggs, sugar and booze - give one pause. A few years back, I discovered a delicious high-flavor, no-risk alternative: milk punch, made with whole milk (no cream, no eggs). And it's easy to make. No cooking, no whipping egg whites and cream: Just mix and freeze. Make a pitcher today, and stick it in the freezer for the season. The spirits keep the milk from freezing; the freezer keeps the milk from spoiling. But remember, it's potent - one of my friends calls it 'the adult milkshake'!",

I added a little more milk to make it a full gallon of liquid and used spiced rum to give it more flavor I froze it and then placed in the fridge to thaw (the more milk you add the more it will freeze solid). I had to make another just to make sure we had enough for every one else to try. I was told I have to make this at every function from now on.

Taste like eggnog but much much lighter which I like and reminds me too of a Brandy Alexander but again lighter. I had a \"gold\" colored rum so I used half brown sugar and half white and it was excellant. Also used 2% milk. It doesn't freeze solid in the freezer but does get \"crystals\" from the milk that melt soon after pouring which too is great because it keeps this drink nice and cold. Rum and brandy can be adjusted to taste but I thought it was enough. Will be making this again.",
