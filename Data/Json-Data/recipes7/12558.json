I used mini chocolate chips in place of the baking chocolate and regular chocolate chips (that's all I had on hand) and did not chop the cherries and pecans as I wanted nice pieces of both in the mix. Mine only took about 35 minutes to bake so be sure to keep check on them as I think an hour may be too long. These are perfectly moist and very flavorful...a definite keeper YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!!

Since I used unsalted butter I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. espresso powder to the sugar/egg mixture. These two additions help bring out the chocolate flavor. I plan on making a few batches of these to add to Christmas gift baskets!! My dear hubby is going to be REALLY HAPPY at snack time tonight!!!",

Also as most people have mentioned the baking time of 1 hour is WAY too long. I baked them for 35 minutes and 30 would have been better because they are a tiny bit dry. I put white chocolate chips on top when they were still warm so they d melt swirled that wit blue chocolate and put cherries randomly on top for a patriotic theme.
