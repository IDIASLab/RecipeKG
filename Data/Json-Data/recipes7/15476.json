That said, they're rather tasty and I'd make them again.\nNext, for the reviewer that claims this isn't a recipe, here's the definition of recipe from Merriam-Webster:\n a set of instructions for making something from various ingredients. Clearly, this satisfies that definition. If you're denigrating the recipe for using store-bought dough, then you're welcome to make your own dough. \nFinally, a suggestion: if like me you bought logs of dough in the refrigerated section, I'd let one of them sit out along-side the cream cheese. I think it would be a lot easier to form the crust that way. The other log, definitely keep chilled; rather than pinching off bits and pieces for the top, I just sliced the log into thin slices; it covered the top admirably.",

I would say use about 1/2 the recipe for the crust and about 1/3 of the dough for the topping.  The rest you can put in the freezer for cookies.  I also lined my pan with parchment which I sprayed with cooking spray.  It made it very easy to lift out of the pan to cut. I think I\u2019m going to win the super bowl party!",

I double dog dare you to find ANY chocolate chip cookie dough in 18oz size! I bought a Nestle Toll House 36oz tub and divided it in half. Worked well. Used 1 pkg regular cream cheese and 1 pkg low fat and it turned out great. Also substituted 3/4 c. Stevia for the white sugar (hey gotta do what ya gotta do)! This is definitely a keeper!!!",

Turns out I didn't have enough cream cheese, only half the amount, so I just halved the rest of the ingredients that involve the cheese.  I then made the cookie portion from scratch (as I don't buy pre-made cookie dough).  Nothing fancy, just the cookie recipe on the choc chip cookie bag.  I was going to use the exact amount of cookie dough specified but changed my mind and just used it all.  So, the recipe ended up with a lot more cookie dough than called for and half the amount of cream cheese...and it was great!

It is the easiest recipe in the world to 'punt' substitutions for whatever you have on hand--M&M's mini chocolate chips raisins Heath pieces different cookie dough etc. If you don't have pre-made cookie dough use a vanilla (or other) cake mix and the Cake Mix Cookies recipe instead. It works just as well. I know--I've done it. I add vanilla to my cheesecake part and use half the sugar just on personal taste. I also mix chopped pecans in with the reserved topping part of the cookie dough for texture and crunch. When I am taking the bars to a more upscale event than a football tailgate I drizzle with white chocolate and dark chocolate diagonally for a pretty effect. Kids and adults love this and it's easy fast and versatile. What more could you want?",
