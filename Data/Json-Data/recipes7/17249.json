I had to make some vegan royal icing to go on top because I didn t think the cookies were sweet enough; my father liked them as they were - he said they weren t overly sweet and he liked that. I think you can use different flavored vegan creamers to alter the flavor of the batter. I used a almond milk-based vanilla-flavored creamer instead of the coconut milk. I think it would be fun to try different flavors like gingerbread peppermint etc. All in all this is a great recipe!",
