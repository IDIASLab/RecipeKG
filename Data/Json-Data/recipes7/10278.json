It bakes into a delicately lemon flavored cake layer on top to reveal  custardy goodness beneath it. Since this includes no butter,  I went with reduced fat milk rather than skim but made no other changes.  I think the baking time, at  50 minutes, is far too long,  tho' admittedly individual ovens may vary.  I would recommend the more traditional baking time of 25-35 minutes (and even less for ramekins).  You can always add more time, but you can't undo it if you bake it too long! I might also suggest that the water used for the water bath be very hot, if not boiling.",

The top layer is like a light lemon cake and at the bottom is a gooey lemon custard.  Great served warm with some cold lemon ice cream.  The recipe isn't clear, but use ramekins.  This would not hold up well if scooped out of a large baking dish.  Also, this reheats very well in the microwave.  It took 60 seconds for me, but microwaves vary.\n\nIf you want a strong lemon flavor I would recommend increasing the zest and/or juice.  The lemon flavor is mild to medium",
