It was a success. I also found the batter too salty so added 2/3 cup extra sugar. First batch just oozed into each other. 3rd batch I accidentally overcooked (11 min) but were better. I baked next 3 batches (it DOES make a lot!) 9 minutes. Not every cookie had caramel in it. Those that did caramel oozed out scorching onto bake sheet. Parchment paper is a must use! It's the ONLY way to prevent sticking to bake sheet to each other & everything else. The cookies in the tin softened overnight resulting in pretty much an eat-with-a-spoon giant cookie. And they didn't rise & could've used more cinnamon flavour. Not happy with this recipe.",

The batter was very wet so I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I also used 1 and about 3/4 large honeycrisp apples. For the caramel, I used caramel bits (that I also froze) instead of cutting up the caramels. My cookie dough was refrigerated overnight. When baking I did need to add extra baking time. The final cookie resulted in a moist cake like cookie with chewy caramel bits when cooled. The flavor needs help, I can agree it could use more cinnamon. We were not huge fans.",
