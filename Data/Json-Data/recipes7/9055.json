This recipe is outstanding on its own but it is so versatile it has to stay in the recipe box. First time I saw I had pumpkin spice pudding in my pantry so I traded that out for the vanilla pudding. 2 cups of raisins instead of chocolate chips and a TBS Pumpkin pie spice. The next time I had butterscotch pudding and used 2 cups of butterscotch chips. Today I am making them again. I am not sure what changes I have in store but even if I don't change it all it will be wonderful. Thank you Cicada77 for sharing such a great recipe.",
