Thanks to allrecipes I found that I can! I only wanted to make a one-time serving for myself and husband so I use a small 3.5 oz can of sweetened condensed milk 1 tsp of vanilla extract skipped the sugar little splash of milk and added snow until I got the consistency I wanted. I served it right away without requiring freezing and tasted great! My husband's favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla and he loved it. I had some egg nog on hand too so added a splash of that to mine and made it Christmas-flavored. We look forward to enjoying this all winter with other flavor additions to experiment with.",
