However I couldn't really taste the poppy seeds and bf wnated to know if I had used thousand island in the sauce somehow. I hadn't but once he'd said that it did make sense. The sauce also made the broccoli cold which I didn't like. I really like the idea but I don't like the sour cream added to it so I might try it again without the sour cream butter and onions to see if it would work more like a dressing. Thanks though for the recipe and the idea.",
