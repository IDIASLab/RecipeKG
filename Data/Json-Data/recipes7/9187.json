You must cook in three 9\" layer pans and carefully divide the batter equally.  Also, the cake needs to be completely cooked or it will fall apart when removing from the pan. Make sure that a toothpick comes out clean to assure the cake is done. But ..........once done and cooled........this cake is fantastic!!! It got raves from my \"cake snob \" son and that takes a lot!  Thank you for sharing this!",

I greased my pans very well and sprinkled with cocoa powder as the recipe called for and had no trouble with the cake sticking to the pan. The recipe called for using a 9x13 pan but it fit perfectly in two 9 inch round pans. It's the most moist cake I've made and it will definitely be my new go to cake recipe. The only thing I might do differently next time is to use hot coffee and mix it with the cocoa powder before mixing it in to the batter. This method is used in other cake recipes to boost the chocolate flavor.",
