Leftovers freeze well for about a month. 2)Place the Cheese in a fine sieve or cheese cloth lined colander overnight to firm and dry. Drained Ricotta works very well or depending on your part of the country Friendship Farmers Cheese is a classic choice. 3)For an Extra Crispy exterior saute over medium/high heat in Butter turning until Brown and Crisp. 4)To finish sprinkle with cinnamon sugar OR Top with your favorite Fruit Preserves and Sour cream. I'm partial to Strawberry or Blueberry! Enjoy...JJ",

I had the opposite problem with the filling. It was very thin and difficult to work with. Even after beating on high speed for 5 minutes it was still not really smooth as called for. The thinness of the filling made it hard to get much filling inside the crepes and there was a lot of filling left over. I wonder if the cottage cheese should be drained before adding?",

For the cheese part I think the recipe submitter means dry curd cottage cheese or farmer's cheese as the cottage cheese we know is too liquidy. I used ricotta cheese and the texture was perfect next time I would add lemon zest to bump up the lemon taste. I used a 1/8 cup scoop for the filling and I had enough for 12 exactly. I baked them in a 350 degree oven as 425 is way too high for the delicate crepes. My grandmother fried them in butter after filling then sprinkled buttered bread crumbs over top. I served with apricot sauce and my sons loved them. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #InternationalFavourites #FacelessNoMore",
