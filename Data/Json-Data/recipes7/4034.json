The only difference is the Tupperware recipe adds 1/2 teaspoon of salt and uses 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of 1/4 cup, giving it a rich chocolate taste. I use Kraft Light Mayo, and it works well in this recipe, yet saves me half the fat and calories of regular mayo. I saved ynathan85's recipe with my revisions so I can put all my favorite recipes in one book and finally get rid of all the cookbooks!",
