I only made this as I am leaving town tomorrow and am desperately trying to use things up so as not to waste them. Knowing I don't like anything sweet in either the salad or the dressing, I immediately knew I would eliminate the sugar in the recipe altogether, thinking the honey itself would make this plenty sweet enough.  I was right--it was \"just right\" sweet.  What I was NOT right about was how I would dislike this--yes, I was wrong!  I'm a convert! This was absolutely delicious!  What a wonderful and tasty surprise! This salad is not only lovely to look at, but the buttery mushiness of the avocado, the sweet tang of the strawberries, the crispness of the greens, the nutty crunch of the pecans and the smooth, slightly sweet honey and lemony goodness of the dressing (I made it a point to get it all in one mouthful) is an extraordinary combination of flavors unlike any I've ever tasted.  You CAN teach an old dog new tricks, and if it wasn't for the fact that I was cleaning out the fridge I would have never known it!",

Being a huge avocado lover and having 11 pounds of freshly picked strawberries, I decided this was one of the dishes I would try.  I have to admit, I've been using this site for years now and this is the recipe that made me register and finally post a review.  All I can say is that this has to be one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  The combination of the Avocado and strawberries was breathtaking. The way the pecan matched perfectly with the dressing and the fruit was perfection.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and halfed the sugar for the dressing, which was plenty sweet.  The only addition I would make would be to add goat cheese.  This is simply a preference but the salad was lacking that tarty goodness that goat cheese brings to the table.  All in all, this recipe was excellant.  My girlfriend ended up making the salad again for her family on Father's day, which everyone loved.",
