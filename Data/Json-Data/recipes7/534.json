But with a food processor just mix dry ingredients and frozen butter (cut in pieces) in processor, process it a few seconds until well blended, add wet ingredients and pulse it until well blended, add raisins or any other fruits or chips you like, just pulse it a couple of times to mix, take the batter out, pat it flat and cut your scones. The batter needs to be well mixed but do not try to get it smooth \u2013 scones are supposed to look crumbly. Easy but so delicious! I omitted the raisins and added butter scotch chips instead - they were a hit. But I'm sure I will try a lot of different add-ons in the future. Great recipe!",

The addition of the orange zest and cranberries gave them a delicious, subtle sweet flavor.  Like another reviewer suggested, I made these in the food processor so the dough came together very well, very quickly.  But sticky is an understatement!  Be sure you generously flour your work surface, hands, and knife when shaping and cutting these scones.  This is the best scone recipe I've tried and it's a definite make-again and again!\nUpdate 11/12/07: I have made these scones no less than two dozen times and they are consistently a big hit with everyone, adults and children alike.  I will never consider another recipe for scones, this one is the absolute best.",

It may work fine for home users but when I have 8 other batches of scones to produce as well as 15 dozen batches of bagel dough that's proofing that need to be pulled and shaped at a specific time, grating the frozen butter seemed to be an unnecessary step.\n\nI melt the butter and they come out perfect every time.\n\nMy oven (non-convection, exposed elements at 25' above sea level) I bake these 5 degrees F down (395f) and at exactly 15 minutes on every batch.\n\nI also lightly top them with raw sugar before baking.\n\nThe Cherry-Almond variant, I add a few sliced almonds to the mix and on the top for a bit of \"bling\" and I drop the 155g of sour cream to 105g, otherwise the almond extract makes the dough a bit too soft.\n\nI also make a Maple-Pecan, Bacon-Cheddar, Jalepeno-Cheddar and Sausage-Chive version.\n\nThis recipe is a great base for any scone you want to make.  I would encourage anyone wanting to make scones, either at home or in their restaurant/cafe to not forget that scones aren't always just a sweet treat with fruits, nuts and berries, you can make them into a great small meal by adding meats and herbs.\n\nDon't be afraid to experiment!",

Mmm, yummy, and halfway healthy too. Some other suggested \"additions\" are: craisins and white chips, lemon zest and orange flavored craisins, hazelnuts and toffee chunks, walnuts and chopped dried apricots, coarsely chopped candied ginger and cinnamon, pecans and Kraftmaid caramels cut into fourths... use your imagination and create scones to die for!",

So this morning I grated the frozen butter with my food processor, switched to the chopping blade, added the flour and just pulsed it a couple of times.  Dumped in the wet ingredients and pulsed just until combined.  MUCH easier, (probably took a total of 1 minute) and texture is the same. These are excellent!  For the raisin version, I suggest adding a generous amount of cinnamon.  The cherry/almond combination is wonderful.\nI also did a lemon/blueberry and a lemon/cranberry batch but definitely use fresh grated lemon rind along with  lemon extract.",
