This strawberry cake tastes light and fresh, never too sweet. A truly excellent recipe that always turns out fluffy and oh-so moist. Topped with the rich and delicious cream cheese frosting, this cake is truly the best ever. It was a handwritten recipe I found in my mom's recipe book, but I assume she found it elsewhere.",

Here's what I did--  first off, I cooked down the frozen strawberries for about 10-15 minutes then strained out the solids with a sieve, pressing out every precious drop of juice ( I had only about a 1/4 cup solids left to discard from about 24 oz berries) I was left with about 1/2 c strawberry reduction.  I used 1/2 c whole milk, 1.5 tsp vanilla, 1.5 tsp strawberry extract, 1/4 tsp red food coloring then with the eggs... I only used the whites, and rather than blending them into the milk mixture,I beat them (at room temp)  with an electric mixer/whisk attachment, till they had soft peaks and blended them in at the end, only for a short time till they were evenly blended, but not enough to chase out the air.  I baked mine in a 10 inch round wilton pan that is 3 in deep, so it took about 40 minutes to cook but will be thick enough to slice through the center to fill. this is THE lightest and airiest cake I've EVER made! Beautifully pink and strawberry flavored!",

The cake does not have a strong strawberry flavor and the color is far from the usual pink color of most strawberry cakes. The frosting really makes the cake.",

My friends could hardly tell it was a strawberry cake, apart from the icing, which was store-bought strawberry.\n\nThe second time, I made the cake again in the exact same fashion, but put in considerably more strawberry pur\u00e9e (a little over 2 cups), and completely melted my butter before adding it (just added that to be fair, though I highly doubt it really changed anything). I also added a small handful of diced strawberry pieces to further accentuate the missing strawberry flavor.\nI decided to actually make the recipe's icing this time as well.\nThe second yield was an enormous improvement over the first. So, as long as you make those small adjustments, this recipe is quite tasty and a strong recommendation.",

I also used blueberries instead of strawberries and used a lot more pur\u00e9e than the recipe called for (omitting the milk as well). It came out great! Nice and buttery and not \"eggy\" at all in my opinion (as was stated by some other reviewers). The frosting is a little bitter due to the Just Like Sugar (I'll use powdered xylitol next time) but it's still good. At least my husband & I like it -- we'll see what the kids at my daughter's b-day party tomorrow think of it. Also I made this into cupcakes one heart-shaped 8\" (approx.) cake -- the blueberries resulted in a deep purple cake (so cool) and I'm frosting it pink which shall certainly delight my very girly girl and her girly buddies. And finally I used cake flour and it worked very well though it's probably fine to use all-purpose or even whole-wheat if you wanted to. I may try this again with almond flour -- since we normally eat low-carb -- though I wonder if it will hold its shape. Still fun for an out-of-the-ordinary birthday splurge.:-D",
