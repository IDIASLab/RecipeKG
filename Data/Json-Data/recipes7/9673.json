Next I doubled the recipe as I needed to make 2 loaves. I knew I was almost out of rice flour so I substituted the white rice and sweet rice for oat flour. I put half of the batter in a greased pan and the other half of the batter I added 4 T of cocoa and 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Baked both loves for the time indicated in recipe. Delicious!!!!!! (I skipped the glaze.) This recipe is definitely a keeper.",

It seems I've tried a zillion Zucchini bread recipes and they either raise up way to high and then flop when they cool or they turn out rubbery!!! You wouldn't even think this is Gluten Free!!!! The only changes I made were... Instead of canola oil I used coconut oil and instead of sugar I used coconut palm sugar. I also added 1 tsp each of ginger cloves and nutmeg (we like a total fall tasting bread). I never would have thought that blending the liquid ingredients and zucchini(I used my food processor) would make the bread so soft... but man oh man!!! This is now going to be my go to recipe for all my sweet breads!! Going to try pumpkin next!!",
