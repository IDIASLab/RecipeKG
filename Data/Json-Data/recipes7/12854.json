As they were otherwise ready to go in the oven, I figured \"What the hey? Let's see what happens.\" They turned out great! They're also great WITH the baking powder (had to make a second batch to compare, of course-wink wink), but they're fabulous either way, just a little more dense without. I ended up adding half the bp, because I like 'em a little denser. I've also since experimented with different jam flavours. You just can't go wrong with this recipe!",
