And they did represent beautifully. They were super moist, they rose nicely. I had to sub the Tequila because no liquor store was open when I needed the right alcohol, nor did my store offer Agave Nectar or any sub that I was looking for. After several AR foodies helped me out, I went with Triple Sec and I couldn't tell any difference at all. The cupcakes tasted of a margarita and I was pretty please! So pleased that I made a 2nd batch of cupcakes using Cherry Flavored 7-Up soda and added 1-2 tsp of cherry extract. I think, those were more my favorite. Topped with light store brand frosting, with a coating of colored sugar around the rim of the cupcake paper, and inserted a straw for added affect. My only nit-pick was that I'm not a drinker and I had to purchase a $10 bucket of Margarita Mix for a small quantity to put in the recipe, however, I quickly made virgin margaritas for my kids and it ended up with everyone being happy happy and loving this recipe and wanting them to be made again over Cinco De Mayo. TY TY TY!!! What a good recipe.",
