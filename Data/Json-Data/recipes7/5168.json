I think this would make for a fantastic pizza crust so I froze half the dough in a tight saran-wrapped ball for using another day. The only trouble that I encountered was transferring a dough round onto the griddle as it didn't really retain any round shape. (And was stickier than I anticipated.) But forget the shape b/c the taste was simple and divine and even better when I slathered it in the \"Basic Hummus\" recipe from here. When I defrost the remaining dough I plan on either trying it as pizza crust or making smaller flat-bread \"balls\" on the griddle as opposed to the big floppy (albeit scrumptious!) dough pile that I had today. Thank you for a great recipe sharwna!",

Like another reviewer, I ended up with 8 rounds (cooked on a skillet) rather than 4.  I was able to cook them without any sort of oil or butter on the pan at all.  Mine took closer to three minutes per side (rather than 1).  This may be because I did not form thin enough discs though.  Either way, they were delicious and I'll definitely make them again.",

My dough made 8 LARGE rounds and it was sticky and took a lot of extra flour. I dry toasted it on a nonstick skillet. In the future I would use less salt. I made grilled eggplant sandwiches with onion and tomato and salted NOTHING so it balanced out. But on any other occasion this bread would be waaay salty and I love my salt!
