Fresh peaches are 2.99 lb in the our stores right now and for the most part they don't have much flavor either. I'm VERY impressed that this smoothie tasted as delicious as it did using canned sliced peaches which I always have on hand. I did use Truvia instead of sugar and added extra ice since we like our smoothies thicker.",

Those are: vanilla instead of plain yogurt, fresh peaches (about two for a smoothie), frozen bananas and no ice cubes, adding 1/8 cup of milk and reducing the orange juice to 1/8 cup, and cutting the amount of sugar in half. The result is an awesome smoothie that has the texture and flavor of a milkshake. Love this!",

I used vanilla yogurt I didn't have any canned peaches on hand so I used a fresh one I replaced the sugar with blueberries and doubled the ice because I like my smoothies to be thick. The result was a fruity smoothie with a rich all natural sweet taste to it. Definitely going to make this for years to come",

It could have been a little thicker though; maybe freezing the banana chunks before blending. Also it was sweet enough as is did not add any sugar since we're cutting back on sugars except for the occasional splurge! Will try it again.",
