This is  recipe is wonderful with fresh greens or frozen or fresh green beans.  Even picky eaters devour these with their slightly smoky, slightly sweet, slightly tangy flavor. My family gobbles them up! Try this recipe with 3 to 4 bunches of greens instead of green beans, too.",

Also I did not use olive oil as I had plenty of fat to use with the rendering of the bacon. Beautiful balance of sweetness with the vinegar but for my taste I might increase the vinegar-to-sugar ratio next time. All in all a terrific variation on a delicious greens recipe. Next time I will give it a go with collards! Thanks Jules!",
