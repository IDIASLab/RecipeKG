The modifications I made included: using cubed organic butternut squash from Costco (still browned a bit in oven) a regular yellow onion and a couple shallots instead of the \"sweet\" onions Suki's curry sauce was used for the curry along with a bit of water Gala instead of Granny Smith's and dried cilantro instead of fresh.",

But since i don't have an immersion blender I roasted the squash til completely tender and soft (about an hour and 15) and ran it though the blender with some of the broth. The second time I used butternut but i had forgotten to snag the apples at the store and being the lazy person I am I pulled out some chopped white guava from the freezer thawed it and added it to a pan of carmelized onion to help deglaze the pan & cook the guava before running it through the blender with some broth. Turned outI like it with guava better than apple I still have a gallon of frozen guava so I'll be saving it for more soup!!",

Use coconut milk - not coconut cream add Italian sausage for meat eaters. First this makes a HUGE VAT OF SOUP. My 10 qt stock pot was completely full. This is not 8 servings of soup. It is easily 16 to 20 servingsI used actual coconut cream. As another posted coconut is very sweet coconut cream is intensely sweet. (it's not necessarily added sugar it's naturally sweet) So 2 jars of coconut cream makes for a very sweet soup. I like it just be aware. Also coconut cream in temperatures of less than 80 F is rock solid. Melt it in a hot water bath before adding to your soup or you will never get it out of your jar. 2 jars was way too much. Use one. This turned into a very very thick soup with 2 jars of coconut cream. Since the directions are \"pour coconut cream into the soup\" I think the OP means coconut MILK. Third: if you are in a mixed household saute up some Italian sausage to mix into the soup for the meat eaters. It pairs beautifully.",
