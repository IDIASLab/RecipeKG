I was out of hoison sauce and didn't want to go to the store so I found a recipe online in which I had all the ingredients at home. I don't think my homemade hoison was very \"authentic \" but boy was it tasty! I now realize that the reason I didn't like this dish much the first time was because I did not like the store-bought hoisin sauce I had used in it. This time I actually doubled the hoisin sauce because I felt like it wasn't flavorful enough with only 1/4 C. Original Review 3/23/26: I used pinot grigio instead of sherry and omitted mushrooms so I don't know how much it affected flavor but I didn't like the sauce very much. Too much hoisin and definitely missing something. I'm not good at identifying missing ingredients. We get a lot of tangerines from our CSA box so I'll make it again and play with the ingredients and report back.",
