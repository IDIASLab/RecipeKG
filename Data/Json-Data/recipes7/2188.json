I don't keep self-rising flour around so following another user's tip I added 2 tbsp baking powder and 1 tbsp salt to the flour. They turned out perfect - high and light and melts-in-your-mouth. Note that the dough is really sticky when you dump it out of the bowl. Also remember not to twist the biscuit cutter when you make the circles if you want high biscuits. Changes: I like these better with butter-flavor shortening just a personal preference. Also I've subbed up to 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour for a nutritional boost and it did not affect the recipe. Dumped in a tbsp of garlic powder & a mix of herbs one time for herbed garlic biscuits and that was a very yummy change-up. Thanks for posting this recipe it's my new standard. EDIT: made them last night but forgot the buttermilk - used just plain 'ole almond milk. They still rose as good as the Bisquick ones do and tasted great. These are truly foolproof.",

I left them in the fridge for about 12 hours. I have never made biscuits from scratch and these biscuits could have passed for \"Grannies Old Recipe\". I used to bake pound cakes years ago in a country restaurant and I found that using a quality name brand flour is super important. I think that the flour I used in this recipe was a key to the success of my first try. I highly reccommend the butter flavored shortening as well.
