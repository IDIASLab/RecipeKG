This could be the reason mine turned out flat and not too fluffy as recipe submitter stated.  And, too, I didn't let it set for 10 minutes as suggested by Sariah Griffin review before I started frying....my pancake loving hubby couldn't wait that long!  I didn't have wheat flour so just used 2 C. All-Purpose.  With all that said, they were really good and we enjoyed them as they were flavorful.  Loved the fact you can just mix them altogether in the blender.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, dalimaw!",

                "reviewBody": "Overall these are pretty good and a total cinch to make too! I did find them a bit too sweet for my tastes especially if you like to top your pancakes with syrup. I would probably reduce the amount of sweetener to 1 tbsp total and use only honey or sugar not both. With that being said if you ate the pancake by itself without syrup it did taste great on it's own--but adding any sort of sweetened topping was a bit too much. I also would reduce the baking powder by a tablespoon as it kind of had that \"too much baking powder aftertaste\"--not overwhelming but it was there. The batter was also kinda runny but the pancakes still baked up nice so no worries there either. (And buttermilk in place of regular milk would be another great variation too!) So yeah these are pretty good pancakes and for the ease of mixing in a blender definitely worth trying again.",

The only thing I did different was once it was all mixed up I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes. It was a bit runny before I let it sit and I am glad I let it. While I made them it continued to thicken and it was great. I made the recipe as is and I will definitely make them again. They freeze great and are a perfect reheat in the toaster.

I like thin pancakes and love to stack them so this wasn't a problem for me, but others might find it annoying. Another reviewer said that 3 tbsp of baking powder left an after taste while a different reviewer said 2 tbsp didn't make it rise, so I spit the difference and put in 2 1/2 tbsp. It worked perfectly! I also left out the honey and vanilla, even so,  they still tasted great with a little butter and syrup. Will definitely make again.",
