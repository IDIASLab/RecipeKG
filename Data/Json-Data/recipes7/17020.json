I refrigerated my cookie dough for an hour because my oven was in use and then rolled the dough into perfect balls before baking. This helps them to be more plump rather than flat and uniform.

I have not made them with both types of chips but I will be trying that next. I followed the directions as described with the exception of only adding about 1/2 of the chocolate chips and they still came out excellent. Great flavour chewy/crispy they check all boxes. I had them in the oven for 12 minutes and then rotated the pan and left them in for another 2 to 3 minutes. Thank you this will be my go to peanut butter chocoate chip cookie recipe and I suggest you should try it you will be pleasantly surprised.",
