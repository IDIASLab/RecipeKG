Placed all on baking sheets lined with foil, brushed with olive oil, roasted in 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes. Browned garlic in melted butter, added the roasted veggies, 1.5 boxes of vegetable stock. Simmered for about 30 mins, seasoned with a few shakes of cayenne pepper. When everything nice and tender, used a submersible wand blender to pur\u00e9e. WOW was this yummy!! My family dubbed it a keeper, and I agree! Was great with the cayenne kick.",
