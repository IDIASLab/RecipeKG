Such traditional Brazilian sweets as Brigadeiro and Beijinho de coco are better and more delicious.",

Sweetness could certainly be adjusted by reducing to 3/4 cup sugar and/or using unsweetned coconut. Could probably use different liquors for various flavors. Overall enjoyable and a great way to use up egg yolks you don't know what to do with!",
