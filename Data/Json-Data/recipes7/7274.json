Added curry powder rhubarb and a carrot - simmered it all until the chicken was cooked. Added a bit of splenda brown sugar blend and regular splenda until it was a flavour that we liked - not too much though. Next time I'll add more carrot and any other vegetables that I have on hand.

It's a very nice recipe, though a bit sweet for our tastes and we'd like more of a stronger orange flavor. Next time I will reduce the sugar and add in a couple of tablespoons of oj concentrate to adjust for that. We used thighs, our preference, and they turned out beautifully.  Served with rice noodles and an Asian salad and it made for a really lovely meal.",

Only 4 stars instead of 5 because I think 2 cups of sugar would be WAY too much. I used a little less than half what was called for and it was the perfect amount and still quite sweet; I can't imagine what the full amount would taste like. Also 45 minutes is a bit excessive. Rather go by internal temperature using a thermometer since chicken breasts vary so much in size. I used smaller ones (5-6 ounces) and they were done to 165F internal temp after 25 minutes. I also had a thought that next time I might try saving a couple steps and time by blending the rhubarb and orange with the sugar curry and salt but NO water then pouring directly on the chicken and letting it all cook in the oven - hence saving the step of simmering on the stove for 45 minutes.",
