As with any recipe I make for the first time I try to follow the directions as written and I'm glad I did. This was fantastic! The cake came out wonderful, very moist and flavorful. The bacon and cheese topping really accentuated the dish perfectly. I baked this in a glass dish so I cut the temp to 325 and it ended up taking about 28 minutes to cook. I highly recommend using real maple syrup not the cheap stuff as it really added a sweet flavor without over powering the dish. We made this for dinner and I can't wait to make it again for a family brunch! Thank you for the recipe!!!",

I would just tweak slightly and this would be perfect for us (and I'm positive I will make this again)! First of all I used Johnsonville maple sausage breakfast links in place of the bacon because it sounded like a match made in heaven (and it was SO GOOD with the flavor of the casserole!) Next time I would blend the cooked and diced sausage into the batter and leave the cheese on top off (but still blend in a cup of cheese). Then serve with warm maple syrup drizzled over the top. Perfection! Love this breakfast casserole for something different!",

It is basically a cake with some cheese and bacon on top. The word \"casserole\" in the name threw me off a little. It is not what I consider a casserole. If I were to make it again I would leave the cheese off of the top. The crumbled bacon is a good flavor with maple syrup but cheese is just weird with syrup. This was a trial run to decide whether to make this in the cabin for Thanksgiving breakfast with our family and I am not feeling real confident about it.",
