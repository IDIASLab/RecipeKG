I couldn't imagine splitting the amount of berries listed into two crostatas. There really was only enough fruit for one. I also felt like the amount of lemon juice was too much--so I'd only add a couple teaspoons or so in the future. I used a mixture of strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and black raspberries and it was great. Overall, with a few adjustments, this is a good crostata--and it's really easy to make too. Thank you for the recipe!",
