This is my go-to recipe for pot roast on a busy weekday. It uses inexpensive cuts of meat, namely beef chuck, made posh by the slow cooker. After years of tweaking others' recipes I think I found a good mix of high-quality pot roast while still being very quick and easy.",

The cream of soup and beef stew seasoning was globby going in and it worried me but it cooks down into the perfect consistency when it is done. I chose the slicing method. Be sure to let it rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board for easy slicing.",
