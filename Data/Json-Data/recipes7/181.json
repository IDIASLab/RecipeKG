The only thing I ever do different is to use mixed berries instead of just blueberries and I use frozen berries instead of fresh. When I use the frozen berries I toss them with a little bit of flower so it's not too watery. Try this recipe and you'll be pleasantly surprised!",

It was yummy !!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe",

It's great with whipped cream on top, or served over vanilla icecream (or both!) Tips: Don't worry about how many blueberries you use...just fill your casserole dish (leaving room for topping)...if you have 4 or 5 or 6 cups, it doesn't make a difference, and MOST DEFINITELY double the recipe for the topping....you won't be sorry!  I run some of it through the berries and then put the rest on top. I also sprinkled the top with a few tablespoons of sugar before baking...gives it a nice crispy top. LOVE this recipe for the taste, and the simplicity. A KEEPER!! Thank you!",
