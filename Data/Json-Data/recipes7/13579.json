I love this recipe, because it has all the flavors of fall. A little trick I learned from my grandmother: use different types of apples for the best flavor. I use Granny Smith, Braeburn, and Golden Delicious, but you can use whatever you like. I serve it as is, but encourage the use of ice cream, whipped cream, or whatever addition the occasion calls for.",
