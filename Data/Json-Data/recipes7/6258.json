I threw out most of the cookies and the unbaked cookie dough. But the cookie dough itself had promise. I decreased the sugar by two tbs and put in 1/2 cup of chopped hazelnuts and 1/3 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes and no other mix-ins. Those cookies are pretty good (probably four stars). I d decrease the sugar a little more but as it was the texture started getting a little dry so I don t think it can go down any more.",
