The flavor ends up being more cinnamon than chocolate because the Mexican chocolate is spiced with cinnamon. The dough was really easy to mix and in the baking process the cookies don't spread much which means they can be baked in bigger batches. The baking time is right on - since I live at a higher altitude 12 minutes was perfect. For those who are not familiar with Mexican chocolate it comes in a hexagonal box with four round scored blocks of chocolate. I've found it in my local supermarket in the Mexican food section and also at Amazon.com. My husband and I are both really pleased with these cookies. They are filling the house with a wonderful aroma as I write. Thanks for a great recipe. This is a keeper.",

The Mexican chocolate and cinnamon flavors are subtle and well blended. I cut the brown sugar back to 3/4 cup and the white sugar back to 1/4 cup and we thought they were sweet enough. I got 48 nice size cookies and 11 minutes seemed to be the right baking time in my oven Thanks Swooda these will become part of my cookie repertoire.",

They have a very delicate but perfect balance of chocolate and cinnimon. I considered adding cinnamon chips but I'm glad I didn't. They don't need a thing! The texture is better than most oatmeal cookies probably due to the use of the blender to cut the oats up in smaller pieces. I used my medium size scoop for the dough and it made exactly three dozen 2 1/2 inch coocies. We give this recipe two thumbs up!",
