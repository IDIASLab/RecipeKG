I also upped the baking powder just a bit to make a little fluffier corn muffin and I used a name brand peanut butter (I've had SO many issues using off brand peanut butter that I just automatically use name brand only because I can't afford to waste ingredients.) I was skeptical that my kids would like these but really they loved it. They each were quiet at breakfast and seemed to really enjoy these. And you know my husband liked them too......which was even funnier. I like this idea so much I might run with it and try a peanut butter/jelly one. Thanks for the great new breakfast muffin!",

The other change I did since I don't have buttermilk handy is to add a tablespoon of vinegar to milk (and allow to sit for 5 minutes). Everything else stayed the same and the soft gooey tastiness in the middle made if FANTASMIC! Great addition Nikki! I wonder if it has anything to do with the substitution of the flour but next time I will try adding more baking powder to see if the fluffiness factor will go up nicely. Otherwise thank you for sharing!",
