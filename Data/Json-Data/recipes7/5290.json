It has a lot of flavor and the beer gives it a good balance and moist texture. I used Red Hook WIT brew in mine it isn't a pumpkin beer but the grocery store was completely out. If you want a really good pumpkin flavored beer try Sam Adams Octoberfest. I also used brown turbinado sugar and replaced half of the oil with applesauce for a slightly healthier version. I could not find chia seeds so i left those out and opted out of the walnuts. I did make a glaze for the top with 3 oz. cream cheese milk powdered sugar and crushed pecans that was A-FRICKIN-MAZING! If you had pumpkin bread as a child and loved it you will love this healthier/adult recipe!",

I had to bake mine for about an hour and ten minutes and to avoid burning it I checked it every five minutes after the suggested 50 minutes was up.

Everything else was exactly according to the recipe and my family gave it a thumbs up! \n\nJust a note though: If you double the recipe, you don't need 76 cups of chia seeds. I have no idea why it did that, but 1/2 cup will do. ;)",

The texture, moisture and rich flavor of this bread is incredible.  My husband went nuts over it.  The only different things I did was that I used a chocolate lager beer since I did not have pumpkin beer on hand.  Also I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Sprinkled roasted pumpkin seeds and a bit of sugar on top before placing in oven.  Doubled the recipe and was glad I did.  Will be making this again and again.",

On the Pumpkin Ale Beer Bread is a  crumb topping and is actually pecans in which I put into my NutritBullet and I turn on it until it came to a crumb /paste lookking mixture.  Then I just sprinkled it on top of the bread mixture before putting it into the oven.  I did set the timer for the 50 minutes as recommended, but I had to put in back in for anther 20 minutes ( two 10 minute intervals ) for the center of the bread to cook.
