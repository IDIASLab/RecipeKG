But I've been making these every morning.  I pour them in a travel cup and drink them on my way to work.  The very best thing about these smoothies is that they keep you very satisfied.  After having one of these in the morning, I don't feel hungry for at least 4 hours!  I usually substitute orange juice for the milk and then skip the honey..and they're still quite delicious!  A few tips...you can use whatever type of fruit that you have and cut it up and put it in a freezer bag to save yourself a few minutes of prep time in the morning.  also, if you find that you don't like the texture of the ground flax seed..you can just substitute 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil (trust me, it won't make you fat..I've been having 1 Tbsp almost every morning, and I've lost 60 pounds!).  These whip up perfectly in a Magic Bullet blender, plus the cups that come with it are easily transportable.",

Since then I have been adding 2 ice cubes as someone else here had suggested which helps to reduce the powder-like texture and taste from the protein supplement. This is a great smoothie considering it is hard to find something to mix protein and flaxseed with without having to force yourself to drink it each day. I also add a little bit of Fibersure to make up for the fiber lost by using flaxseed oil rather than the seeds themselves. It is a great way to up your fiber intake. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

The ice seemed to perfect the texture for me. I was looking for ways to add flax to our diet and I'm glad I found this! In a tweaked version I also added a tablespoon of wheat germ and 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. That also was very good! p.s. If your blender is like mine and doesn't grind the flax seeds up all the way just grind them in a coffee grinder beforehand for better health benefits and digestion. (Whole seeds don't digest.) I bought my Krups grinder for 16 at BBB (with 20% coupon).",
