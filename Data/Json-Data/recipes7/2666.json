I made the Panna Cotta in wine glasses and poured the sauce into shot glasses. It looked as great as it tasted and was so much easier than trying to separate them. I would recomend this to anyone with only one downside. That being that it isn't something you can make on short notice or because you are \"craving it.\" It takes quite a while to set up (at least 4 hours but overnite is best) but if you are planning a desert for the following evening it preps quick and is very easy.",
