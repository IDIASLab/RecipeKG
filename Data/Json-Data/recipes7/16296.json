Definitely needs salt in recipe\u2014I use 1/2 teaspoon and a pinch in topping.  If nuts aren\u2019t an issue for you, add nuts of your choice to topping-finely chop a 1/4 cup or more if you like.  I also add 1/4 cup raisins as my family likes them, and a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves as these spices are my favorite.  Another thing I\u2019ve used is 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and cut back on the vanilla.  I think my husband buys peaches and \u201cforgets\u201d to eat them, as he knows I will not let them expire, just so he can have more delish muffins!These muffins rise nicely when baking and the topping is a perfect addition.
