First although I cut the carrot pieces pretty small I should've grated them. The motor of my blender almost burned out. Second putting all the ingredients in the blender wasn't such a good idea; it wasn't enough liquid to process until smooth. I had to add more oil. I also transferred the mixture to my food processor otherwise I would be shopping for a new blender today. When it comes to the chocolate sauce this step I did do my own way. I started on medium decreased to medium-low and stirred until bubbly and thick. If I would follow the directions and do my sauce on low it would take me much longer to make the sauce with the same result. Overall the cake tasted good but I found there wasn't enough moisture in it and if I make it again I'll add more oil.",
