I used orange juice instead of pomegranate added the juice and zest of 1 lime about a tbs of Grand Marnier omitted the apple and didn't use the pecans. I attempted to boil the pomegranate for a while which did make it a little easier to take out the seeds. I didn't bother straining any of it because I don't mind pomegranate seeds. Either way it was a nice twist on the classic cranberry sauce and perfect with turkey and potatoes and could work as a dessert sauce too.",
