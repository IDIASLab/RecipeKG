I decided to buy good quality green tea and emptied out 5 tea bags into my coffee grinder to produce matcha it worked pretty well. I also incorporated some leftover matcha into my crust along with some green tea Pocky sticks. I don't like melting my butter when I make gram cracker crusts because I feel that mixing in cold butter until the crumbs stick together give it a better taste and texture. I also decorated the cheesecake with green tea whipping cream an apple swan and pocky sticks. Overall it's a pretty good recipe will defiantly be making it again (:",
