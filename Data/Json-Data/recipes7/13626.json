I strained just enough syrup that I needed for my recipe and then mashed the blueberries to make what I suppose really is a blueberry sauce. I didn t think the syrup had all that much blueberry flavor and I just couldn t see discarding the blueberries considering how expensive they are. I scaled this down to 12 servings but don t think you ll have enough to serve over waffles or pancakes because the yield is small. I ended up with 3 oz (the container is marked) of the blueberry sauce so you d have even less than if you strained into syrup. You might have enough for a small dollop over ice cream or a slice of pound cake. It tasted fine and this served a purpose today but I won t make this again.",
