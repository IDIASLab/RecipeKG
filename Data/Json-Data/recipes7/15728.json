I\u2019ve uploaded a photo, so you\u2019ll know what to expect.  But don\u2019t panic, all it took was a good stir, and it was good-to-go.  Surprisingly, these were some of the best waffles I\u2019ve ever had.  I ended up with eight 4-inch square waffles that rose to about 1-inch in height (thanks to the yeast).  They were moist, tender, golden brown, and simply delicious!  I\u2019d mixed up the dry mixture early yesterday, but when I was finishing up heating the liquid last night before I went to bed, I was grumbling \u201cwhy did I get myself into this?\u201d  But I soon forgot about that this morning when all I had to do was heat up the waffle iron, stir up the batter, and in minutes, had a wonderful waffle breakfast on the table.  Mike Marks, thanks for sharing this recipe, it\u2019s definitely worth the effort and nice to try something totally different for waffles.",
