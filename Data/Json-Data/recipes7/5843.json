I had thought I grabbed a can of white beans at the market but I grabbed pink.. so I used those. I might make this again but with spinach which for me is a milder flavor. Updated - I had some leftovers of this for dinner tonight and the bitterness has toned down considerably. If you are new to greens like me I'd recommend making these a day before you plan to eat them.. it really improved it!",
