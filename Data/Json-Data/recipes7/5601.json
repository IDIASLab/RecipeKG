This is an almond-filled Easter bread adorned with Easter eggs and almonds.  The thing about this recipe is, if you make 2 you might as well make 8.  It takes time so this year I was able to start the tradition with my nieces who will be helping me.  I swear that this is the greatest Easter bread.",
