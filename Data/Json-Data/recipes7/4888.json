I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4 tsp. each of salt and baking soda. I added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 2 Tbsp. of Parmesan cheese to give it a little pizzaz. Next time I might even add in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I did end up adding a little more tomato juice to the dough. I rolled these out on a lightly floured surface and cut it with a mini- biscuit cutter. I baked these on parchment paper and they baked up beautifully in ten minutes. I topped them with melted butter - YUM!",

The texture seemed off to me too - hard to describe just didn't seem right. Was the balance of baking soda off because of the V-8 perhaps? Further probably because of the V-8 they were too salty. I much prefer biscuits made with buttermilk or milk and a higher baking temperature of 425-450 degrees.",
