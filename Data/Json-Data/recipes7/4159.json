I made it just like the directions but I felt it was a little too sour for my liking but I shared it with my mother-in-law and she loved it. It was very sweet and sour so much in fact that I could not taste the mint in it. I plan on making it again but I think I am going to cut the amount of lime juice and lime zest. By the way to make this recipe according to instructions you will need 5 to 6 fresh limes.",
