If you do not know how to make gravy here is what I did: after browning the meat (I did not cook the onions with the meat), I removed everything from the skillet. Then you put oil, onions, and flour in the pan..... keep stirring until the mixture browns. Then pour the natural juices from the steak into the pot while stirring vigorously! Add add extra water to the mixture if you desire thinner gravy or simply more gravy. Then you add your veggies and meat and finish cooking as the directions stated! It was very good",
