This one is simple (no nuts or frills) and it tasted oh so good! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have 3 hours to refrigerate the dough. I did put it in the fridge for about an hour though and the consistency while rolling into balls was fine. I used the back of a 1/4 tsp to make the indentations and I put the jelly into a bag and piped it on. I used strawberry jam and the little chunks made it a little messy at times, but most of them came out looking great. And the ones that didn't... well they sure didn't go to waste! I melted about a cup of white chocolate and maybe used half of that for the cookies. They are sweet enough and don't need the white chocolate, but it does make them look nice.",
