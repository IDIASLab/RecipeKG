I was concerned that it might not be quite chocolately enough with just the cocoa powder so I took a dark chocolate bar and grated it into the dry ingredients before mixing them into the wet. The cake was very moist and everyone loved it. The frosting was very very sweet--too sweet for me. Again it wasn't very chocolatey so I actually almost doubled the amount of cocoa powder but I think when I make this cake again I'll use a different frosting recipe. I did like the frosting consistency though.",
