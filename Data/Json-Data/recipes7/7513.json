Still even though I had to help the heavy bottom and top stick together by squishing a little after taking them out of the pan they were good and stayed together after that. The chocolate chip melts just enough inside with the cream cheese that it is divine. I put larger walnut chunks on top and wow so good!",

I did not use walnuts because I'm not a big fan. Depending on your oven you may not need to bake them for the full 25-30 minute time period. Mine took about 16-17 and this gave them a crispy top soft bottom and moist in the center. Perfect combination. They are VERY filling and very delicious. One other thing don't put the toothpick in the center. Put it more towards the side because the center will not come out clean due to the filling. If you stick the toothpick in the side and it comes out clean....they are done baking =)",

I frosted them with Pamela's Products gluten free vanilla icing and the buttery vanilla flavor went very well with chocolate. My only negative comment is that I'm not sure the purpose of the vinegar. I thought it might enhance or change the flavor from an average chocolate cupcake. Regardless I'll be making these again for sure so that's a very small negative.",

Subbed half the cream cheese for vanilla yogurt because I doubled the recipe and only had 8 oz cream cheese on hand. Apparently you don't need to double the filling anyways because I ended up with TONS of extra delicious filling. Ok so everyone's probably wondering what I was wondering--should I add an extra thin layer of chocolate batter over the scoop of filling to make it truly a filling and not just a top layer... I give you two samples. First batch did what the recipe said just pressed an oiled spoon onto the top of the batter to make a groove and plopped on a blob of filling in the center and baked. You can see the white all over the top--it never \"sank\" in as I expected it would. Second batch I added the thin top layer of chocolate batter and it looks and tastes better somehow. Kids thought they tasted \"eh\" but I think they are great. Fun to make and not as time-intensive as I feared.",
