Great snacks for March Break and lunches, thanks!\n#AllrecipesAllstarsCanada\n#FacelessNoMore",

The Bran FLAKES need to be run through a Food Processor in order to be mixed into the batter until smooth... I did that knowing no amount of stirring would break down the flakes to a smooth consistency... it worked by processing them.",
