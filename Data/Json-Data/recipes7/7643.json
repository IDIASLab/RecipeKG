Here's where I really changed it up...I put a light sprinkle of the streusel mix, then a layer of thinly sliced apple, then the rest of the streusel, then the rest of the batter.  It was exactly what I'd hoped it would be!  Cinnamony, appley, brown sugary, toasted nutty, cakey goodness!",

I only made 2 substitutions: brown sugar for white and pecans for walnuts in the filling. The cake was incredibly moist with a smooth texture. I made it in a bundt pan, but next time will bake it in a regular tube pan. You'll want the streusel caramelized on top! BTW, it took about 55-60 minutes in this type of pan. For the sake of your thighs, don't make this too often! It's hard to resist another slice.\n\nI made it once with nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream - tasty, but the cake fell (probably not enough fat in the batter). I wouldn\u2019t recommend making this substitution.",

With one thing or another I ended up not trying it but pple were still eating it today so it was probably pretty good (I brought it in Monday and today is Wednesday). I made three layers of the topping--there's enough to do so in this recipe if you sprinkle--because I wanted a ready made topping on the actual top of the cake. Since bundt cakes are cooked upside down I put part of the topping on the bottom before putting the batter in. Not sure I recommend that as a lot of the sugar caramelized and stuck to the pan. Looked pretty though! Thanks for the recipe!",
