The filling was a little bit more than the pie crust could hold, so I just put the rest in a container in the fridge - a nice little treat!   I also used cool whip instead of whipping my own cream.  Also, I substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream, and therefore reduced the granulated sugar by a tiny bit.  Even with the shortcuts, it was still a light, not-too-sweet, fresh tasting dessert.",

It's slightly sweeter, so consider using a little less sugar. Also, I used an additional  1/2 cup of blueberries. I may use the whole pint next time (or put some on the side, as shown in the picture).  I also may try shortcuts -- already made whipped cream and graham cracker crust. Kind of hate to tamper with it though -- delicious!",
