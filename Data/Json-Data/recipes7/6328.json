What a treat it was to wake up, turn on the oven, pop in this coffee cake, and then have a house smelling like cinnamon.  This is very easy to mix together the night before, and you won't be disappointed that you took the time to do it.  This cake rose beautifully, the texture was very light and moist, and the taste was crazy good.  The next time that I make this, I'm going to add some chopped apples just for a variation.  Maridele,  thanks for introducing me to your fabulous coffee cake recipe; going into my Favorites folder.",

I added about 3/4 cup of blueberries and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter also reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. Can't wait to make this again. As another reviewer said next time I would put a layer of the topping in the middle too. Thanks again Mimi S.",

Considering it's a totally different recipe than the last one I made I know it's something I did not the recipe itself. I did use plain yogurt instead of sour cream but it definitely wasn't that that screwed it up since I swap yogurt in recipes all the time with great success and the other recipe for coffee cake I used didn't require sour cream to begin with. The biggest change I made was scaling it down to an 8x8 pan but yet again I'm sure that's not the problem. I've really got to figure out what I'm doing wrong here! Either way the flavor was awesome just like I wanted but again something I'm doing is giving me a slightly more bread-pudding-like texture than I'd like.",
