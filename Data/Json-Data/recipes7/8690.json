I think next time I will add some minced jalape\u00f1o to give it a bit of a kick, since we like things spicy. I also used only half the stated amount of sugar. I served this with some chicken. Thankfully I had made this salsa because the recipe I picked for the chicken was SUPER bland, so this salsa really saved the day!  This would also be excellent on a white fish such as cod or sea bass and would make a great accompaniment to seared tuna.",
