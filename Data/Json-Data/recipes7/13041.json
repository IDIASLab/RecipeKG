I used this recipe for breadsticks based on the fact they are called \u201cfluffy\u201d, as my plan was to make a Bosco Stick or cheese filled breadstick.  I\u2019m glad I used this recipe, I followed the instructions mostly except allowed 1 Hour for rise, then when broke into sticks, placed a mozzarella stick in the center of each and allowed 30 minutes for rising.  Oh MY word!  The BEST!  My family loves these!",

To prep, I portioned it out the same as in this recipe (2 oz portions rolled into 7\" sticks) and let it rise about 2 hours. That's the trick! Then brush with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt. Weekends perfect every time! I also added a lil parmesan at the end and it was super tasty!",
