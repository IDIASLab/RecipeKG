I followed the recipe to a \"t\"... and my first sheet pan I put in the oven and set the timer for 8 minutes so I could check on them. After the 8 minutes they were nowhere near done so I added 4 more minutes still not done... that's when I bumped the oven up to 350 and let them go for another 5 minutes and then they were done. The 2nd tray I baked at 350 for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I have to say this made exactly 24 cookies using a 1\" cookie scoop - so the servings are spot on. I did press them down slightly before baking (like little hockey pucks) which I recommend doing as they don't flatten very much on their own. All-in-all a great recipe - just watch the time and temp according to your own oven and press down slightly before baking. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used unsalted/unsweet coconut and the sweet fluffy batter all came together well. \n\nWith low provisions during COVID, an old bag of pistachios is one of the ingredients I have to work with, looking for a real pistachio dessert recipe this was PERFECT! I also had an old bag of coconut snacks- two birds with one stone. \n\nMODIFICATIONS: based off other reviews I baked it for 17 min. I also flattened them with a fork because they do not spread. \n\nNEXT TIME: I'm going to add an extra egg, the batter was very dry and it made for a crumbly cookie.",

I used another reviewers tip and did 12-13 minutes at 350 and the came out a bit more done. I think flattening the shape out before baking would help. I would add another 2-3 tablespoons butter as I found the dough to be too dry and decrease the amount of flour by maybe a half cup. I would try this recipe again but with some changes.",

I loved the crunch of the chopped salty pistachios with the contrast of the sweet coconut. Another plus for this recipe is that there is no need to chill the dough to get a slightly puffy cookie. I used a # 50 scoop and as Kim suggested I flattened the dough a bit as it did make for more even baking of the cookie. I too baked these at 350 for 11-12 minutes and got about 30 cookies. I doubled the recipe the second time I made these as they were gobbled up quickly by the family.",
