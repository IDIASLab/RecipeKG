Going to grab a glass while I go back to cleaning my nut bag. Another superb addition to Chef John's great recipe collection!",

I completed the four-hour method initially, but then refrigerated the pitcher for several more hours to work the ingredients more. I used a metal sieve because I didn't have cheese cloth or the nut sack thing lol. It worked out well and it tasted amazing. I loved the light texture, and the flavors complimented each other really well. I made this in the cold December weather, but I could imagine how refreshing this would be on a hot July day. Thank you Chef John.",
