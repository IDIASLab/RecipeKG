First of all...there's already enough fennel seed in Italian sausage that adding more is complete overkill. And it's definitely lacking ingredients for a full, rich sauce...such as...bell pepper, mushrooms, fresh Italian basil, fresh spicy oregano, fresh parsley, and a bit of red wine. (by the way...red wine is what should be used instead of sugar) Also...1/8 to 1/4 cup olive oil in your sauce will keep it from coagulating and also makes it a healthier recipe. A couple pinches of black pepper and fresh thyme sprinkled on the sauce when served finishes it off.",

Personally, it was too much meat for me and next time I will cut the sugar in half or omit it entirely.  If you can find the Contadina brand tomato products I recommend using them.  Their flavor is less acidic than other brands.  This may be why I didn't think it needed the sugar.  Their roasted garlic flavored tomato paste is the best!!",
