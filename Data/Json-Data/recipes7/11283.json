I chose to replace the milk with water since it called for both yogurt and protein powder. I also cut the yogurt to 1/2 cup (I tend to think greek yogurt is quite tart). Milk, protein powder and yogurt seemed like protein overkill for me. I didn't have mint in my garden so I skipped that also. The smoothie is VERY thick from the frozen fruit. Even my Vitamix needed a little attention to get ingredients to blend but adding more liquid would help solve this problem. I chose to give it a little time and use the tamper to push the ingredients into the blades. This may be a problem with a regular blender so letting the fruit thaw a bit before blending would be helpful. This smoothie turned out very tasty. I enjoyed it!",
