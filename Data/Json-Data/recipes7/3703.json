Rates 5 with toppings of sour cream, jalepenos, etc. Had to make changes, but good results with 'em ... made 'em two days in a row! Still wanted more after that! Used 1/2c finely chopped onion; 2 cl garlic; 2c chopped, cooked turkey; 1/2c FIREROASTED TOMATOES, undrained (sub for salsa), 1/2c reduced fat sour cream (sub for cc), 1/2t dried cilantro, no cumin. After cooking the o & g for a few minutes, I added the rest along with a cup of cheese. Didn't heat it. Just rolled as was. Used 1/2c in each. Made my version of Mrs Espy's enchilada sauce. It's listed in the review, if you want it. Put a little in the dish & poured some over the enchiladas - about a cup total. Had to thin the remaining (to have enough) with turkey broth the next day & it was still very good. Be sure to not leave any exposed or they'll dry. Then half cup cheese on top. Baked loosely foil covered 20 to 30 at 350. Best thing of all? BOTH KIDS (11 & 13) LIKED THEM! That rarely happens - unless it's dessert! :D ... Jan 2012 Doubled with a 8oz bar cream cheese. It's better than sour cream, but sour cream is still good. Double recipe ensures leftovers.",

Easy to use if you heat in microwave with a wet paper towel for 20 seconds...no tearing no problems. I prepared the filling as written except no cilantro (don't like it) and added chile powder. Did not add cheese to the filling but did add a about a fourth of a can of enchilada sauce along with the 1/4 cup salsa. Wen filling the enchilada I put the chicken mixture then cheese rolled and placed in pan. when all were in pan poured remaining enchilada sauce rather then salsa over the enchiladas sprinkled with cheese and onion and baked for 20 minutes. These were so good! I will make them again many time. I think the one I had left over and reheatd the next day was even better. thank you for a super recipe.",
