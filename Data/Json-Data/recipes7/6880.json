Next day removed one let come to room temp and punched back down. Made pizza came out as perfect as the first. The whole family loved this pizza. Thank you for the recipe.",

As I was adding the flour, needed to add about 1/4 extra water to blend in all the flour (may be my local climate since I've noticed this with other bread and pizza dough recipes). Used slightly warm water, around 100-105degF and used about 1 tsp of honey instead of sugar. Warmed oven to 170 deg F then turned off  and put the dough in there to rise.  Topped with tomato sauce, pepperoni, sauteed broccoli, and mozzarella. Cooked at 430 deg F on a nonstick baking pan for 15 min. Made a nice thin crust. It was pretty good but not amazing.  I'll try it again next time using all white flour not the wheat mix.",
