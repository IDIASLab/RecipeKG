I had to be extremely careful when taking them off the cookie sheet. They are also very thin but chewy when all is said and done--can't speak to how they hold up day in and day out since I just made them today. However I imagine they crisp up pretty quickly. I used a small cookie scoop and was able to fit 9 on a sheet but spaced them out pretty well. You need to with these. I also cut the spices by about 1/2--I only used 1 tbsp cinnamon 1/2 tbs of the other spices and am glad I did. I'm convinced the full amounts would've been too much. I also baked for 9 minutes and allowed to cool on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off. Thanks for the recipe!",
