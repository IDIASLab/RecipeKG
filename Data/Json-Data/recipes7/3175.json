I just made my usual margarita (2 parts margarita mix 1 part tequila = total 8 oz) added ice and a half of an avacado (didn't want a whole avacado to go to waste if I didn't like it). If you're looking for a spin on a margarita this isn't it this comes out thick and creamy like a smoothie - an Avacado Smoothie. I usually salt the rim for a margarita but I don't think salt would go with this. Hubby doesn't care for avacadoes can't get past the green so he didn't like it but if you love avacados like I do you just might like this.",

It is not your traditional margarita and one you definitely need a straw to drink it with. It was more like a boozy smoothie. The cilantro was a nice touch too. The one think I did not like is that I felt it needed a little sweetness added. Maybe a little honey? This was fun and made \"happy hour\" feel a little more healthy.",
