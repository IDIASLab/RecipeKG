They are more of a vanilla flavored cheese cake with chocolate topping. I followed the recipe to the tee so it is not that I altered it in any way. I was just disappointed that they were not what I'd expected as I love Boston Cream Pie. Boston Cream Pie does not contain any cream cheese which should have given me a huge clue that these would not taste like it. One of the reviewers posted that these do taste like Boston Cream Pie so I took a chance. I will make these again as they are easy to make and do have a great flavor especially if you are a cheese cake fan which I am. These would make a great addition to a buffet or appetizer type meal since they are individual servings easy to handle and eat. But I do think the name of the recipe should be changed to a more appropriate one.",
