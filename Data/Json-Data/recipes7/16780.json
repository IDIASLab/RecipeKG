For the Latte layer pour on top of cooled graham cracker crust then chill until firm... or put in the freezer to make this happen faster. Once it's firmed up pour in the pumpkin layer. Otherwise it seems unavoidable the flavors will mix. I preheated the oven to 350 then turned it to 290 and baked for 60 minutes turned the oven off and left the dessert in the oven to cool for a few hours... from past experience w/cheesecake this avoids the fast cook/cool and sunken/cracked or discolored cheesecake.
