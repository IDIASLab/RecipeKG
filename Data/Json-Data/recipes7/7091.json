However, the reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is because as an \"Asian\" salad, this dressing is all wrong.  My family and I lived in South Korea for 8 years and loved all of the Asian flavors and salads we were served.  There was one particular restaurant that I felt had the BEST house salad in the world!  Amazingly (they are SUPER accommodating in Korea) , they gave their salad dressing recipe to a friend of mine and then she passed it on to me.  Actually, the foundation of the dressing for this allrecipes salad is pretty close, although way too sugary.  If you cut the sugar down to 1 TBSP and then add at LEAST 3 TBSP of soy sauce and a little minced garlic, it turns this salad into something very close to what we had in Korea and we LOVED IT!  Also, if you like a little more kick, I'd suggest adding a bit more red pepper flakes.  I used the Korean brand found at our local Asian Mart.  The suggestion of adding arugala sounds really tasty.  And, next time I make this I will add a side of garlic bread to help round out the meal.  You can also soak up the extra dressing with the bread and it is SO yummy!",

For \"Asian\" dressings marinades and dips we always add a little fresh or powdered ginger more garlic than this one calls for and a bit of sirachi (\"Rooster\") sauce. As one reviewer said the sesame sauce is pricey but it is SO rich that you only use a little and it lasts a long time. There really is no other substitution for that delicious and unique flavor!",
