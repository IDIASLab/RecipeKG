Only thing I did differently was bake it in a 10\" springform pan rather than a 10\" tube pan. This turned out very moist light and the cream cheese filling gives you a hint of cheesecake (IMO). Next time I'll double the amount of cinnamon in the topping as I'd like to taste more of it. Makes a big coffee cake and a good one too.",

This is a great recipe when incorporating some of the tweaks. I did add cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture (@1/2tsp) and a large heaping spoonful of sour cream to help make it more spreadable. I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/8tsp of salt to the batter. It turns out perfect. I do like making mine in a springform pan as someone earlier suggested. Pretty presentation.",

I also used natural unsweetened yoghurt instead of sour cream because I had no sour cream left. The cake is super soft and moist - I'd make the recipe again just for the cake texture. I was tempted to add lemon to the apples and may do so next time. The last change I'd make is to add some butter to the streusel topping to help hold it on the cake.",

The only change I made before baking it was to add cinnamon to both the cream cheese and the batter itself glad I did or it would have been very bland and substituted white sugar for the icing sugar. Also since I was using a bundt pan I put the chopped nuts along with some oatmeal on the bottom and then put the batter on top. Turned out good next time I'll put more. The cake is very sweet so I will make it with a little less sugar next time. I foung the cream cheese filling a bit heavy next time I will add a bit of sour cream to it to thin it out. Everyone here at work liked it the cake is very moist I will definitely make it again with those changes and update my review.",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of minor details: I doubled the cinnamon as recommended by lutzflcat and I baked in four individual pint Corningware baking dishes. I reduced baking time by about 10 or 15 minutes for these portions. Oh and I skipped the nuts for personal preference. One huge eater would eat one dish or two big eaters eat the same but one of those in about 4 is about right for most people so I would say this entire recipe serves 12-16 normal portions. I made a couple of rookie mistakes when making these but didn't seem to affect the outcome. Also when making it I thought it was pretty skimpy on the cream cheese filling but I restrained myself and followed the recipe. I'm glad I did as it was just the right amount. Thank you for a great recipe.",

It sinks almost to the bottom. I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 t salt in the batter. I loosened up the cream cheese mixture with some milk and sour cream. I would have been more difficult to spread without it. I made it in a spring form pan and baked around 70 minutes. I also added 2T butter to the crumb mixture but that was too much. One T would have been better. All in all I would make again if I needed a large coffee cake for an event. Oh I was concerned about burning the top so I covered it loosely with foil the last 20 min.",

I added a small amobut of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture but will not do that again. I used a 9\" round pan. When I tested the cake the toothpick came out clean but the center of the cake dropped after I took it out of the oven. Next time I leave it in the oven for at least 5 minutes after it tests done.",
