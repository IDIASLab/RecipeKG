        "description": "This is my friend Judy's sauerkraut recipe, and in my opinion, it's simply the best.  Great served with crusty rye bread, mashed potatoes, and freshly cooked apples. Combine the kraut with a meat entree and bake in the oven at a low temperature 1 to 2 hours.  Examples of meat entrees that work really well are small pork roasts, tenderloins, or chops, bratwursts, knockwursts, and kielbasa.  Slow cooker temperatures vary, so this may be done sooner than 8 hours.",

Hubs prefers it cold straight out of the can or package while I prefer it mellowed out usually with a little brown sugar onion and bacon grease. I won this time. This recipe was right up my alley and what I noticed about it immediately was that it seemed to call for less sugar (I used brown) than other recipes. I also liked the additions of juniper berries cloves and bay leaf which gave the finished sauerkraut more complexity. What I did differently and I m glad I did was add less than half the beef broth called for. Even with that reduced amount the sauerkraut was plenty liquid-y and would have been swimming in liquid had I not. I also omitted the caraway seeds Hubs doesn t care for them and I didn t want to push my luck. The biggest takeaway from this for us was that Hubs loved it. Imagine that! I can only surmise that since it had such a small amount of sugar that the sauerkraut still had the sour he loves.",

                "reviewBody": "This is the closest recipe I have found to the recipe given to my mother by a French girl while they were stationed in France. Mom's recipe is made in a skillet over medium heat. I use 4 slices of bacon, chop, brown then remove the bacon leaving 1/2 of the drippings in the skillet. Saute onion in the drippings until translucent. Squeeze the brine from an 8% sodium/serving, 32oz jar of Sauerkraut. Do not rinse the sauerkraut! Add it to the onion. Throw the bacon pieces, clove, juniper (I get mine from nuts.com) and bay leaf in and add about  20 oz Chicken broth. Bring to a boil then turn down to simmer for no less than 1 hour, 2 is best. Your goal is to simmer out the broth while adding in more to keep it simmering for the 2 hours. Don't simmer it dry.  You want it a little wetter than moist. I brown bratwurst in the oven at 350 turning frequently and add them to the skillet before serving. If you want the bratwurst to knock your socks off then cook it outside on the grill. I never add sugar or caraway seeds, that is more Bavarian than I like mine. But in all fairness the bratwurst is made with sugar in it and probably makes up the difference. Serve on Kaiser rolls with Dijon mustard and you will think you are wandering through the streets of an Alsace Market.",
