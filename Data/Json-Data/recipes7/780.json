My recommendation would be to take others advice and use the boneless chicken thighs.  (The chicken was a little dry.)\n\nThis stew deffinetly could use some brightening at the end.  I garnished with some chopped parsley.  It was still a little sweet for my taste though so I added a few sliced green olives.  I have to say, it was delicious with the olives.  It had the sweet/salty thing going on!\n\nI served with flatbread and rice trying to decided which would be better.  The flat bread was the winner, in my opinion.  All in all, I would make it again.",

This is about as good as it gets aside from it being cooked by a Persian mom (which by default will always be better). I don't really like chicken legs but I used them anyways based on the reviews. SO good! I used really fresh walnuts and I found that after a couple of hours of simmering a lot of oil went to the top. It was easy to blot the top of the stew before serving and that cut back on the grease factor somewhat. This isn't the most aesthetically pleasing dish but it definitely makes up for its presentation in taste. I will definitely be making this one again! Thanks a lot for the recipe:)",

Taking another reviewer's advice I made double the portion but kept the pomegranate juice quantity the same substituting water & vegeta seasoning (as I'd run out of stock). It was moist tender and delicious. As someone mentioned previously the appearance and aroma while it's cooking is unusual if you're not used to working with these ingredients. I was worried my guests might find it odd-looking and I'm sure a few did but they all loved it.:) I made it with some carrot & onion basmati rice and some Syrian beans (from AllRecipes) and served it with some heated (and olive-oil brushed) Persian Barbari flatbread which I found in the neighborhood. Fantastic. I accidentally posted this review for the Persian Fesenjan recipe but it belongs here. (woops)",
