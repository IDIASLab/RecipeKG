(seasons 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1 tsp Apple Pie Spice)  Next Time I will add 1-2 more apples.   My skillet is bigger than 9\" so I gently stretched the 9\" room temp pre made pie crusts with rolling pin just a touch so I had a little edge to crimp and seal.  No big deal if you don't have enough pie crust to seal. The yummy sugar butter mix just oozes up over the top crust when it bakes but regardless put aluminum foil at bottom of oven to catch bubble over just in case.   I also had to bake mine longer than the recommended 45 min at 350.",

My daughter in law made this first but found it too sweet. So I reduced both the brown sugar and the white sugar by half. (I did have sweet apples tho). I will definitely make this again and next time will reduce the butter by half. Will let you know how it turns out! ps: don't expect to even find that bottom crust after covering it with apples.",

Super easy. I was making pie because I had a bag of apples that were to tart to eat plain so I made minor adjustments to make up for that. I added 1/8 tsp  ground cloves and 2 dashes allspice to flour mixture. I later realized I added 2 tablespoons  flour instead of 2 teaspoons like recipie said. (woowps, but still we Loved it). And like another reviewer said i tossed the apples in the flour mixture then added to crust. Everything else the same. Will for sure make again.",
