I read the original blog post and adjusted the crust recipe to avoid it turning out gummy or gritty. Here are my adjustments: 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar omit egg prebake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. The crust cooled while I mixed the filling. I did use homemade puree so I reduced it on the stove until it was almost as thick as canned. Word to the wise: don't rush plan ahead and bake/cool as directed in the recipe! With my adjustments I give this recipe is at least 4 stars. This recipe is a work in progress but definitely worth the work!",
