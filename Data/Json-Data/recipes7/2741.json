It made 5 servings for me.  Everyone loved it and it's such an easy way to use cooked rice.\nThank you so much for this recipe, I will be making this again often.",

I wasn't going for the best tasting rice pudding ever more for a quick easy close to tasting perfect type.:) I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of using evaporated milk which grosses me out I replaced it with 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1/2 cup regular milk. I only added 1/4 c of sugar so it didn't over power the hint of coconut. I added two eggs and a tsp of real vanilla extract. All in all it came out perfectly and it's a great way to get rid of left over rice.",
