The only differences are that we peel, core and grind the pears raw before cooking. Cooking first might be less time consuming because they would be easier to peel. Also we do not use onions but extra red bell peppers. (They are very attractive in the jars.) For variety, the last batch I made, I added chipoltle peppers. This went over well with this family that usually wants it \"just like grandma made.\"",
