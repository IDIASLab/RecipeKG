I always get a little OCD when quantities for bananas are given as just 'pieces' as the size of the fruit really does affect the end result sometimes. In my case I think the bananas were a little too big (I used Cavendish) so my cupcakes took a lot longer to cook and got a little brown at the bottom (temp was spot on). Otherwise the cupcakes themselves were perfect. The frosting was way too sweet for me and most of our adult guests but the kids loved it!",

My kids love banana and chocolate chips together and these were so easy to make and they really are more of a \"cupcake\" than banana muffin! The cream cheese frosting makes it even more special. I did end up adding just a tad bit more flour to the batter as it seemed too loose. They turned out perfect and the batter was the perfect amount for exactly 12 cupcakes.

I did not use the cream cheese recipe; instead I used the Easy Cream Cheese Frosting from here. Nothing against this frosting; I just grabbed the other frosting recipe while shopping and had those quantities of cream cheese. These cupcakes are easy make pretty much exactly 12 cupcakes if you put equal batter amounts in each tin and baked up for me in 30 minutes. They are moist with that pop of chocolate. Might be even better with mini chocolate chips. Since my daughter and husband loved them enough to ask for these for her party I think they deserve 5 stars from us. Thanks for sharing.!",
