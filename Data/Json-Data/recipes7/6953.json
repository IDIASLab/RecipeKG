My mother is crazy; regardless I now realize what she was saying all those years ago as she chanted \"coo wacha la kema\" at a dried leaf. When you come to a crossroads in your life take action. For me that was whether pursue my dream of mimicing rocks or write a review for these disgusting pancakes. To this day I think back to hours ago when I made that influencial decision and think i did it mom I made it. When I went into the journey of making these pancakes or at least that's what I thought they were I thought it was the journey that really matters no the destination. I was wrong. I began questioning this recipe when I almost drowned in the thin mixture. Luckly I had my floaties on and I survived to write this critical review. Only realizing when I began cooking this recipe shows no yeild I made too much for my little pet spider bill. These crepes tastes almost like omletes no the sweet pancakes I was hoping they'd be. I might just be a bigoted fool for not know what a crepe was but regardless it was a gelatinous disgusting mess. Anyone looking to make this recipe just remember sanity is the stem brocoli.",
