Admittedly, I am not big on cloves. But, put together and is terribly tasty. After I found out the recipe was from here I immediately looked it up and was surprised by what little feedback there was. I must say I probably would have skipped this recipe over with so few people having tried it. How great that I was able to have an opportunity to try this keeper of a recipe. It is on my stove as we speak (really) and I am going to cook it just as directed for the full 2 hours. I know first hand it is worth it. I wouldn't change a thing!",

                "reviewBody": "This is seriously good food and very easy to prepare (can't imagine that it would take anyone 20 minutes to prep - more like five)!  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the sugar by one tablespoon and used only one teaspoon of kosher salt.  I was probably a tablespoon shy of 1/3 cup on the vinegar, too.  Had no ground cloves, so threw 3-4 whole cloves in.   The result was addictive!  Didn't want to quit eating it!  I was skeptical of the extended cooking time, but having tried it after about 45 minutes, there's no question it is much better later.  The apple (I peeled mine) basically disappeared during the cooking process, so next time I might just use applesauce to make the prep even faster.  This makes a great side dish for turkey, as a less-sweet substitute for cranberry sauce.  I added cold leftovers of it to a turkey sandwich - yum!  It would also be delicious served with roast chicken or duck, grilled or steamed bratwurst, kielbasa, baked ham.   Recommend doubling the recipe.  Leftovers can be used cold on turkey or ham sandwiches and take well to reheating.",

Couldn't stop eating. It's so good and appetising!! Now I make my own variations. I used EVOO instead of butter. I added mustard seeds and I also lightly crush the black peppercorns. I like to bite on them! I added onions too. I tripled the recipe threw all into the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 hours. I'd put them in jars and refrigerate them. Used them like pickles or relish for burgers/sandwiches. I served them whenever I serve roasts or fried meats. It gives a sharp refreshing contrast of taste and flavour. I even put a small amount on small squares of toasts and ham topped with a dot of mustard. Served them as tapas with a big icy jug of sangria. It was very popular. I've even had it for breakfast with fried eggs and bacon.",
