It was disappointing considering it is a more complicated muffin recipe. I used a stoneware muffin pan maybe this contributed to the problem? It hasn't been a problem for other recipes (I make muffins regularly). I did add the milk and yogurt to the butter and egg mixture and mixed well before adding to the dry ingredients because the recipe as written seemed like it would be too much mixing for muffins. These muffins are also rather sweet in my opinion to be considered \"healthier\". I give two stars because the flavor was yummy.",

I only put 1/2 cup of sugar in as I thought that would be plenty and because I didn't have almond meal on hand I just did 1c white and 1c wheat flours.

These are good muffins and my hubby enjoyed them. The only thing I did different was to use semisweet chocolate chips for half of the recipe because I ran out of enough of the dark chocolate! The chips tended to settle down at the bottom of most of the muffins making them just a little soggy at the base. Otherwise these were good----and were gone quite quickly! Thanks for the recipe!",
