I've made 3 batches.  The first batch was a disaster.  Although my pears were ripe, they weren't ripe enough so they never dissolved.  I even tried stick blending them but it didn't work.  I also followed the directions and simmered on medium for 2 hours, however, after only 1 hour, it all of the sudden turned into a burned mess.\n\nMy second batch came out much better.  You want to use very ripe pears - almost too ripe - so that they break down when cooked.  Also, I cooked this for 3 hours on low - the lowest my stove would go - to prevent burning.  It worked like a charm!\n\nMy third batch is cooking now.  I again used very ripe pears but I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I think this is my favorite batch.  It's darker, richer and has a much more complex flavor.  \n\nEveryone who has tried it has loved it!  Thanks for a super recipe!",

You could taste the pears and their mild flavor was so delicious, I decided to can more and give as christmas gifts. when I made the full recipe I burned it , so be careful.
