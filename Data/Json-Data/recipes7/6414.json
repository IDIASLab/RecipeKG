I just patted the meat dry and added the sugar.  I probably only used 3/4 cup total.  We really liked the taste of this meat, and 8 hours was perfect for the meat, but too long for the vegetables.  I was worried the beer would make the dinner bitter, but it wasn't, at all.  A nice meal that I would make again, only adding the vegetables about 1 - 1 1/2 hours after starting the meat.  Thank you, COUNTRYRAY, for sharing your recipe.",

Even my husband, who is not generally a fan of corned beef, loved it. The only change I made was to mix the spice packet (included with the corned beef I bought) in with the brown sugar before rubbing it on the beef. This will definitely be my go-to corned beef recipe from now on.",
