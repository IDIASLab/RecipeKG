        "description": "Russians call it 'Korean Carrot Salad,' but it is so absolutely ubiquitous in Russia that if they didn't originally own it, they certainly do now. Coriander provides primary flavor; cayenne provides the heat. To get it right, you MUST use a mandoline to julienne the carrots into long, thin strands like spaghetti. To save time, buy them already julienned at the grocery store. This dish is best after it has marinated for 24 hours, but is fine after only 4 or 5 hours.",

                "reviewBody": "Had this dish in Kazakhstan at a family member's farmhouse meal and loved it. I asked how it was made and this is essentially the same recipe (except for the onions). The first time I made it I used prepared minced garlic instead of fresh--big difference. Go buy a real head of garlic and mince the 3 cloves by knife. The first time I also used a grater--wrong! This time I first tried to use a Mandoline to julienne the carrots as some recipes for this dish specify but it just wouldn't work. Finally I pulled out my little handheld Veggetti spiral julienne device and used the larger of the two sizes. Worked great!!! Was more like the original dish we had had. I suppose a Cuisinart would work if you have one. I also did what most reviewers did: cut the salt way down to 1 tsp. I didn't have or want onions so I left those out but still use the oil added to the vinegar and spices like with any dressing. I also cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp since we don't like \"hot\" or spicy. Next time I may only use a dash--even 1/4 tsp was too much for us. I used avocado oil because I figured it may be better than just plain canola oil. (I have read not to use olive oil in this recipe btw. ) Agree with everyone that this needs to marinate at least 4-5 hours and better overnight.",
