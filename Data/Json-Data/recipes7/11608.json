I think it is sweet enough, so I just used a simple powdered sugar glaze on top. It went very well with fresh fruit at tea time; really a delightful treat. Thank you for sharing the recipe. PS. I forgot to add that I only used 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder.",

After baking it was still a bit too dry so next time we will double the oil and use 4 T. coconut oil. Other than that perfect sweetness. Kids even loved it and asked for more. May also try adding a smashed banana for extra moistness or even applesauce. Overall a simple easy tasty recipe. Thanks!",
