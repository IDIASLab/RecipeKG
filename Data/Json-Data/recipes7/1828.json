Then I added a 1.4 lb butternut squash and 1/2 a chopped large sweet potato an inch of chopped peeled ginger and 1 and 1/2 cloves chopped garlic and filled the pot up mostly with water to cover the vegetables (maybe about a 1/2 inch higher than the veggies) and about 1/4 cup of organic chicken stock. I let this simmer for 30 minutes and then added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (as per other reviewers' suggestions) and a pinch of nutmeg. Then I pureed it in the blender. It was so creamy and delicious (and sweet from the Fuji apple) that I didn't need to add cream or yogurt. I seasoned it with salt and pepper. Absolutely divine!",

Chop: 1 peeled and cored apple (I used Granny Smith because it's all I had); 2 celery stalks; 2 peeled carrots; 1/2 medium onion; 3 inches of peeled ginger. Saute all of the above with 1 heaping Tablespoon minced garlic in 2 T butter (or oil) for about 10 minutes, or until soft. Set aside. 2. Put chunked sweet potatoes (or yams) and butternut squash in a large pan with about 2 1/4 c water and  2 1/4 c. chicken broth. (I used 2 cans of the chicken broth, and a little more than that of water--whatever it takes to cover the tops of the vegetables.) 3. Once everything comes to a boil, add the sauteed mixture from before and let simmer until everything is pretty soft. 4. I added 1 t. of cinnamon and about 1/2 t. of nutmeg, 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 t. of pepper BEFORE blending/pureeing it. It saved me a step, and it came out great.   It doesn't really need yogurt, in my opinion, but I added a dollop of light sour cream before serving, making it a little creamier.",

I did not have any butternut squash so I just used 5 sweet potatoes. (In retrospect the flavor would have been far too mild if I had followed the recipe and used squash plus 4 sweet potatoes.) Based on suggestions of other reviewers I saut\u00e9ed the onion garlic and ginger first added a diced apple and some diced celery and used vegetable broth in addition to water. Instead of adding yogurt I blended in some silken tofu. The resulting soup was pretty good but following the recommendation of at least one reviewer I then tried adding some curry -- that really enhanced the flavor. My husband is a picky soup eater and although he wasn't thrilled with this before I added the curry he complimented it TWICE after he ate it with the curry. Next time I make this recipe I will use more fresh garlic and ginger (especially ginger).",
