Secondly the consistency of the \"pudding\" was nice and creamy. Mine got a little eggy but that was my fault for not mixing it in slowly enough. The problem was I let my pudding cook for almost 4 hours on high and the rice was still crunchy. I didn't have time to let it cook anymore and it was starting to burn on the sides. So I had to eat crunchy rice pudding which I really don't ever want to do again. I don't notice with other recipes that my crock pot cooks at a lower temp. I saw that one other reviewer had to cook for 5 hours and I'm sure another hour would have made a difference.",

Thank you.\nI read most of the reviews before hand in order to avoid making mistakes but to be honest there is nothing to it, it's dead easy. I followed the instructions as it is but the only thing I did was doubling the amount because I thought the original quantities not enough for a big family! So 1 cup of rice and 8 cups of milk and kept the same measurements to the rest of the ingredients!!! Haven't said that it took 5 hours to cook and I must say that after 2 1/2 hours I opened the lid to check because nothing was happening and milk still the same so I gave it a stir and added another additional hour!!! After the hour has finished I checked again and still too watery, gave it another stir and added another hour! Then I started see results!!!  when the hour was over I followed step 4 and added another 1/2 an hour and when I scooped it out it came out to a tee!!. Will definitely definitely recommend and make it again",
