I subbed in half a cup of veggie oil because I was short on butter and I added an extra tablespoon of both ground pecans (no almonds =/) and flour to the filling/topping and gave the the topping an extra 5 minutes in the oven because of the \"slimy\" comment and they turned out great. Only caveat here was the crust it was a tad dry and needed extra time in the oven to brown but I suspect my pan was too small.",
