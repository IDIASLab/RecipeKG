                "reviewBody": "Even with all those wonderful ingredients something was still missing---and it wasn't just that I went a little short on the sambal oelek. It needed salt and pepper which I would add to the meat just before cooking it. I also recommend cutting the meat from a semi-frozen state because mine was fresh and it was almost impossible to cut thinly. The other thing I missed was a little something on the buns when broiling them---a slick of butter or mayo for a little flavor/moisture. My carrots weren't exactly the right kind to slice thinly---I needed some bigger and maybe needed to use a mandolin to slice them. Don't read this review and think you shouldn't make this sandwich! Just a couple of changes (in my mind anyway) would make this a spectacular sandwich! Seriously the ingredients are all wonderful! I appreciate having the chance to make this one for our dinner tonight! Thank you Cooking44!",
