The crust was slightly sweet so the fact I didn't have turbinado sugar didn't mar the end product and almonds + cinnamon + blueberries?  Of course!  This recipe also came together really quickly.\n\nChanges: I would be more generous with the cinnamon next time, which is on me.  Additionally, I had thawed my blueberries because I thought the frozen fruit would have too much water.  Finally, the cook time has to be reduced.  By 14 minutes my pies were starting to burn so I scooted them out of the oven way early.",
