I used some old hot dog buns and frozen rhubarb from last year (drained VERY well). I was concerned it might be too sweet with the sweetened condensed milk and added sugar but worried for nothing - don't change anything. I had extra bread and rhubarb so I used a 9x9 pan but it was still done in 1 hour. I will be begging friends and neighbors for any extra rhubarb to make again! UPDATE: Just made this using 1 pint fresh blueberries (on sale for 99 cents!) and it was just as good, if not better, than the original. Also used almond extract instead of vanilla. Love this recipe!",
