                "reviewBody": "I used golden raisins but would use Craisins in the future. There's one confusing step to this recipe which was a bit of pain to correct. In step #3 it says to \"drain and discard wine mixture \" but I think this should read \"drain and discard mulling spices.\" You want that reduced wine mixture and those infused raisins but not the mulling spice mixture (it's already done its job). Should have used my head but I added the mulling spices to the wine and raisin mixture and when I realized that there were things in that mulling spice that might break a tooth I had to go through and pick all of the pieces of the cinnamon stick star anise etc. (all those hard things)....aaaargh! Think what you need to do is put the mulling spices in a cheesecloth bag and tie up or even better if you have a tea strainer use that. This part was a hassle but on the positive side it does taste good.",
