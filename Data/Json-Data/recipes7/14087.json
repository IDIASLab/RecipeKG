I never remove the green collars.  It may make the color more on the green side when you start, but the jelly ends up very flavorful and the color of apple jelly or honey.  Made two batches just this week.  If you use the larger jelly jars the jelly may crystallize the same as honey but it doesn't affect the flavor.",
