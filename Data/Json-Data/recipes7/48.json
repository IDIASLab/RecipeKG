Due to sheer stupidity, I then proceeded to add more nuts, coconut and raisins than called for.  Despite that...it turned out yummy!  So long as you and yours enjoy nuts and raisins, you'll really like this dish.  I'm not a huge raisin fan, but I enjoy them in an Indian versian of bread pudding, so I worked with them--and they were really great.  \n\nAnd it's such a fun and unusual dish to prepare! :) SUPER easy.  Seriously.  SUPER quick.  I am prone to all sorts of culinary disasters, yet it all worked out--I heated the milk mixture, added it, and cooked it while my guests were enjoying wine after dinner.  THAT quick.",

It was pasty and lacked the moistness of a good bread pudding-type of dessert. I'd like to try again with out the extended warming.",

After baking I split those squares in half or in quarters and the varying sizes all worked well as the final product. This is best eaten right after it's cooled. I made the Umm Ali for Father's Day and now every time my dad talks to me he demands that I make it again ASAP! It was absolutely delicious and everyone who tried it loved it. I recommend serving this right after it cools from the oven. It doesn't even need ice cream added it's so delicious. Also I tried some leftovers a couple days later and it wasn't nearly as good because the bread had absorbed all the milk. Still had the flavor though. Thanks so much for sharing!",
