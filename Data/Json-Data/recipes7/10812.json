Also I used my food processor to do a rough chop on the cabbage. I bought a 2 gal crock for it which worked well for one head of cabbage a one gal. would probably work. Quick easy and healthy it stayed nicely in the fridge in a large lock and lock container. I am making another batch today. Loved it.",
