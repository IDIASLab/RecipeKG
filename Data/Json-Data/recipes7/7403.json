The 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds did little to enhance the flavor of the finished coleslaw although visually appealing. If rated against bottled coleslaw dressings this would definitely get a 5 but don t expect it to match or exceed coleslaw you ve had that stood out as among the best. The write up talks about eliminating the need to run to the store to buy bottled dressing but more cooks will have milk or buttermilk and cider vinegar on hand rather than the ingredients listed here. To season this a bit mustard powder and Creole seasoning was added. This dressing is very good for what it is but coleslaw that distinguishes itself from typical deli slaw is our preference.",
