Very sweet, especially with the dates, but the cookies turn out very nice so to alter the sugar, flour/ oat ingredients might change the integrity of the cookie. Love that it uses whole wheat flour. I used  unsalted butter and am glad  I did as the cookies are plenty salty.  I will use this recipe again and play around with some of the other suggestions made by other reviewers. (coconut oil, flax seeds, etc.) to make them even 'healthier'.",

These are my changes: substituted butter with coconut oil used 1 1/3 c brown sugar in place of both sugars doubled the vanilla extract reduced the all-purpose flour to 1/2 c reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp omitted the cinnamon and dates and added 1 c chopped pecans and 1/2 c raisins. The rest of the ingredients (eggs baking soda & whole wheat flour) were kept the same as the original recipe. My family loved these!!:) I try to always have these already rolled into balls in the freezer so I can just take them out of the freezer to room temp while the oven gets to 375F and bake them for 12 minutes this way they are done but still a bit chewy and just delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
