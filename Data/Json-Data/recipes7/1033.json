I filled it with a combination of raspberry pastry filling and peach perseveres and it was delicious. Instead of putting the crust into a dish I simply rolled it out on a silicone mat into a huge circle. I laid out my filling leaving a lip of around a third of the dough and then I folded up the edges to make it look like a rustic crostata. Mine took longer to bake an extra 10 minutes but it was well worth the wait. Next time I'll put more filling towards the edges. I think this cookie/crust is full of possibilities. Next time out I'll fill it with homemade applesauce. It's made for experimentation.",
