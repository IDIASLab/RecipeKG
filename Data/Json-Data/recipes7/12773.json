I originally bought it for peanut butter smoothies, but found they also used it in commercial baked goods to up the peanut butter flavor without the greasiness. I followed the recipe exactly only subbing Jiff Whipped peanut butter for regular. I lined my square baking pan with heavy duty foil and sprayed it well with Bakers Joy. It lifted out of the pan and cut into such nice perfect squares. Using the slightly lower calorie Jiff PB Whipped peanut butter and cutting it into 16 pieces, instead of 12, the calories count equaled 165 calories per brownies.",
