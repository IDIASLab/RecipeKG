I used saskatoons (service berries) instead of blueberries because that's what I had. It wasn't quite as crispy on the top as I would have preferred. I probably could have baked it longer. Since the recipe doesn't state an actual pan size I guessed when sizing up so then I wasn't sure how long to bake it. It was a little thin in the pan. Maybe less butter poured over would have helped it to crisp? Flavour balance was good. I liked that it didn't have ridiculous amounts of sugar unlike similar recipes.",
