I was disappointed in my dish because I used oldish frozen beans that were past their prime. Not the recipes fault obviously. When the recipe says the garlic should be dark brown be careful. Burned garlic is awful and will wreck the dish. It can go from nice toasty to burned in a blink. I served it with a spicy meatloaf and it was a nice fresh counterbalance to the dinner.",
