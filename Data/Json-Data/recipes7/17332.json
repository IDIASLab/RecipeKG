I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of adding some fennel seeds (just something we always like in red sauce). Honestly if I didn t know differently I would think this was made with ground beef instead of ground turkey and this sauce breaks down really well nutritionally love that! I liked the chunky texture so I didn t bother to use the immersion blender to smooth it out. Nothing to change here this is delicious exactly as written. And a big THANK YOU to wonderbread403 for submitting a recipe for 20 oz of ground turnkey the way it s always packaged (otherwise what to do with the last 4 oz??). Thanks for sharing your recipe it s a keeper.",

We did use the immersion blender at the end, and I think it made it turn out more \"restaurant\" style. I don't know that it needed it, but it really mixed all the flavors in and gave it a great taste and unique texture. I followed the recipe as written but did mix in a tsp. of chicken bouillon, about a 1/2 cup of water, and then added 1 TB. of butter at the end. It was so good on the tube pasta we used, as the sauce was able to get into the tubes and each bite was super saucy. I loved that it used ground turkey, but you couldn't even tell that what we were eating was healthy as it had such a rich flavor. I'm sure it will be even better today when we eat leftovers.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.",
