Also added 1/2 cup extra flour, to make up for added moisture of applesauce.  When I made the glaze I added 1/4 cup Brandy instead of vanilla, remove from flame when adding it.  It is now one of my favorites.",

My changes were since I didn't have allspice I used 1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove and 1/4 teaspoon of grated whole nutmeg. I also didn't have quiet a half cup of half and half so I added dark rum, around 2 tablespoons. I think this actually thinned the glaze a tad, but it soaked into the cake and made it super moist. It was definitely a hit and also a goner. Will make again!!!",

The glaze harden into a candy like shell which broke a part when we cut into it. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the guess just gathered up the broken pieces and ate that too.
