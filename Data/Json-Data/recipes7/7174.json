I used canola oil instead of olive and I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I also added onion powder in the same amount as the garlic to the recipe. Every thing else I did the same. \r\n\r\nWhen I took out the dough from the bread machine I rolled it out and cut it into 4 equal pieces using a pizza cutter. them rolled each piece out put sauce and topping folded the top half over and closed. then put on a greased cookie sheet and brushed the tops of calzones with melted butter. I was worried that the dough might not cook all the way through but this turned out beautifully!!! Golden brown and crisp on the outside and nice and soft dough on the inside. DELICIOUS! This will be my new pizza dough and dough for any Italian dish as well as rolls. Very tasty!!",

I am incredibly pleased and look forward to trying other options (pizza dippers, anyone? Stuffed with mozzarella?) with this dough. \n\nI did let mine sit and rise covered in plastic for several hours (more than the 30 minutes suggested by the author) and found a very flavourful, easy to work with dough at the end.",
