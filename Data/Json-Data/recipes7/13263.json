I changed the serving size to 8, which was the perfect amount for a 9 x 9 dish. I also added a big pinch of course salt to the crumble mix and then topped the finished product with another shake of sea salt before baking... I felt this kept everything from being too sweet for my family\u2019s taste. Great recipe- will definitely use again with all kinds of seasonal fruit!",
