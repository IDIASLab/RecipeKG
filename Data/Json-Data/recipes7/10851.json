This recipe was delicious. My hubby, who usually wants nothing to do with anything that has the word \"casserole\" in it, proclaimed it a \"Keeper\"! (He even went back for seconds!) I made it exactly to the recipe. I don't think the ingredients I substituted altered the taste in any drastic measure. I was surprised how much flavor this had for just using salt & pepper for seasoning. I plan to serve the leftovers as a side for some baked Cod. I think it will go well together.     Update: Paired the leftovers with baked Cod and they went quite well together.  Baked the Cod with just a coating of melted butter, salt & pepper. Put the leftover casserole in a smaller baking dish, covered with foil. Put both in a 375\u00b0 oven for about 20 minutes.  Deeelish!\nUpdate: I wanted a pasta dish so I made this minus the Ritz crackers, using 50/50 Sharp Cheddar and Mozzarella and about 1/2 cup additional milk. I mixed it with a box of Penne pasta (half cooked - about 8 minutes) and put in casserole dish. I topped with a thin layer of Italian bread crumbs and covered with foil to bake. OMG! This is definitely a keeper!",

I subbed in Swiss for mozzarella because that's what I had on hand but I think it was a crucial change. I omitted the Ritz crackers and subbed almond meal. I added garlic powder paprika salt pepper and Italian seasoning to the almond meal then tossed it with a couple of tablespoons of melted butter before topping the casserole. The sweetness of the almond meal was a nice compliment to the squash. So SO good! I think turkey sausage would also be delicious. Thanks so much for a great recipe!",
