Rather than adding the sugar though I used raw honey instead for this recipe because I hated to cancel out the benefits of the oats with all that white sugar. The result was something very close to the flavor of Cheerios so we call this Cheeriata.:) I want to try this recipe exactly as is at some point but I'm about at my sugar limit after all that horchata lately. If you're going to use honey remember that honey is sweeter than sugar so you don't need as much. I also added a little bit of flax seeds with the oats when I blended them. I'm so glad y'all posted this recipe because I'd have been too scared to try it without knowing it was \"a thing.\"",
