Was worried I wouldn't be able to find Creole seasoning in my Yankee grocery store but low and behold- there it was.  This gives it a very interesting flavor.  Fun to make, and pretty easy.  My husband and I both liked it.  TIP- be sure to mix dry ingredients before you try to mix them into the meat.",

This also meant for a lot more dishes to wash:( Hubby really liked it for sandwiches though since it holds its shape better than most meatloaves. I couldn't find creole seasoning in the grocery store so I used the adobe seasoning I made up also found on this site. Don't be put off with the amount of sauce it makes because once in the oven it will thicken.",

Next time I make it I will make the sauce a day or two before and store in the fridge until I am ready to make the loaf. Thanks for the recipe!",
