Mine took 20 minutes I'm sure because they were bigger and also my oven is wonky so next time I would try 375 or 400. I doubled the raisins added 2 tsp of Vanilla extract and brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled a little sugar on top. Flavor wise these are delicious and I'm sure with the adjustments mentioned these were work out perfect in the future.",
