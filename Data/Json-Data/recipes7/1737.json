The flavors are wonderful and quinoa has a great lightness and fluffiness that acts as a fabulous base to present the gingery spicy flavors of the mixture. I have a friend who has a restricted gluten-free diet but always loved the flavors and coziness of stuffing so this has been popular with her but also with the rest of the potluck crowd when I have made it. I love how versatile the dish is too - you can substitute margarine for the butter and eliminate the cheese to make it a vegan dish; you can add nuts or a dried fruit (currants for example) to the stuffing; you can experiment with other kinds of cheese (I've used goat before and it worked well).",

I also used parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella because that is what I had on hand. It turned out perfectly! I topped the dish with chopped toasted almonds before serving......so good.
