Normally I would use a Jiffy Cornbread recipe because I've been too scared to try making cornbread \"from scratch.\" I followed the recipe with one small modification: yellow cornmeal.  I did not have white cornmeal to use.\n\nI didn't have a lot of time to get this made because I was working with it last minute. The recipe was so easy to follow which is a huge factor for me.  It had a reasonable amount of ingredients and doesn't require three hours of stirring, kneading and other various baking terms I didn't have time for.\n\nIt made a HUGE skillet full.  Very thick. So delicious and I don't even like cornbread! Hubby loved it and apparently so did the sugar ants.  I am adding this to my \"kid tested, mother approved\" file.",

The cornmeal -flour ratio especially. With that, it's much more \"gritty\" than the recipes with similar amounts. 'Not a bad thing necessarily just something I noticed. I added less sugar 1/4c. A third would not have been too much though. As cornbread I like other recipes better; as the base for cornbread dressing I think this is our winner.:) Something else I noticed this sizzles when it's done. Weird with only a quarter cup oil. Other recipes that have more fat don't. Huh. This bakes with slight brown patches near the edge & a flat (not rounded) top. MOM'S SWEET BUTTERMILK CORN BREAD by NandaBear",

I guess about 3 tbsp butter and 1 of oil.  \nIt was exactly what I was looking for. I now have a big problem.
