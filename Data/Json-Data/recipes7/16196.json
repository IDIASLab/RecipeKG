If you love jackfruit or have some to use up I recommend trying this recipe. I substituted syrup for molasses and whole milk for cream. I dried out and cut up some very ripe (almost no latex) jackfruit as described in this recipe though it took longer to dry out. Very time consuming--the recipe would be a lot more worth it to me if the jackfruit were bought dried. I wouldn't buy and dry out a jackfruit just to try this recipe but I enjoyed trying it once and it was something new to try with the jackfruit! One thing to note: for measuring flour I measured by scooping with a spoon into the measuring cup and then leveling off. When I did this the dough looked too wet but I tried it as it for the first batch. The cookies tasted good but spread out a lot. I added several tablespoons more flour to what was a more normal (chocolate chip cookie dough-like) consistency and this spread out much nicer and tasted a bit better I thought. I think if you just scooped the flour straight out of the container so that it were more dense they might work better.",
