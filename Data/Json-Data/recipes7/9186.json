I've made a similar recipe with Ritz cracker crust (no sugar), lemonade concentrate (whole can) and Cool Whip (whole thing of it I think) that I also remember liking, for those of you who are wondering if this would work with Cool Whip. I made this as directed but as usual my whipped cream didn't whip at the bottom of the dish (I don't know why I have that issue) so it wound up having a non-fluffy layer of rather icy stuff in the bottom of the pie which tasted fine but it really is better if you are able to whip it completely. I enjoyed the lime flavoring on this one, or maybe it was the tequila. Either way, great recipe, thanks!",
