I also rolled the buchi in untoasted sesame seeds prior to frying (that is how I remember it from the chinese restaurants in Manila).  I also used red mung (monggo) beans cooked in syrup and mushed them up (I wanted to find it in paste, but only found the whole beans - it is also a halo-halo ingredient!)  This is a good reference if I can't find the red mung beans in syrup, the dried, green mung beans are more readilly available.  Thanks again!  ",
