I\u2019m hoping the author of recipe can add a review (give the recipe 5 stars) to explain how much salt to add for water bath method and what the baking soda is for. My husband actually liked the bitter melon prepared this way with the black bean sauce (only his 2nd time trying it; I grew up with it and have acquired taste for it). For those who don\u2019t know, bitter melon (or gourd) is bitter! Do not skip step one because the salt is going to reduce the level of bitterness, but step 1 was not very clear for me\u2014I have no idea how to make salted water for an ice bath\u2014how much salt to water? :( There are a few methods to reduce bitterness. Simply, parboiling does not reduce the bitter enough for us. I halved the bitter melon, remove seeds, slice, and place slices in colander (over a bowl). Added 1-2 tsp kosher salt over the slices and combined with hands, set aside for 1 hour. You need to use Kosher or Sea Salt\u2026NOT table salt. Rinse and drain off excess water. Prepare your ice water bath. Blanch the bitter melon slices in lightly salted water for 1 minute and place in ice water bath to stop further cooking. Continue with recipe. I also omitted the baking soda because I couldn\u2019t figure out the need for it, but I suspect it further reduces bitterness. I had 2 melons, hence doubled the recipe. I felt the amount of water was a little too much, but hey\u2026more sauce is always good! I loved this recipe and will be making it again!",

A recipe like this found on allrecipes.com is uncommon and that's probably why there's only 3 reviews. I decided to try it anyway. It's very similar to how the generations in my family cooks with bitter melon and black bean sauce. However it's a really good recipe and I've used it a few times. You must be fond of bitter melon to want to make this. I loved it!! Thanks for sharing:)",
