I made the recipe as written except I halved it for a 9x9 pan and I omitted the topping because the pecans I had in the cupboard were MIA. The batter was very wet I had to add 3 tbsps more flour. I used 2 small red delicious apples chopped finely. Mine baked in 31 minutes. This was like a snacking cake very light and fluffy. I found it a little too oily and sweet when I make again I would halve the butter and sugars and then halve the topping and see how that works. I lined my pan with parchment and cut into 9 pieces. Thanks for a fast and tasty recipe!",

Since I have lots of apples in need of a home, I mounded it up to to maybe 9 fluid ounces . Used 1.5% fat buttermilk most stores stock. Packed brown sugar hard in measuring cups.  Oven temp 350\u00b0F. Removed from oven at 40 minutes. Internal temp in center of cake was 205\u00b0F. Pan was glass 9\" x 13\".  Texture and taste both seem just right for me.  Thanks!",

But the cardamom is delicious recipe easy overall a nice recipe. I had no butter so I subbed 1 scant stick of margarine used walnuts and soured milk as per cook s note. I agree it could have taken a bit more flour (or a bit less sugar) but it works the way it is. Thanks!",
