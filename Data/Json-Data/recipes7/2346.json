You can view the step-by-step photos at www.bakedlava.com I added 2 packages of pudding mix a full cup of chopped pistachios and a 10-ounce jar of cherries. It's funny but the first time I made these they did have an odd greenish tint to them...with 2 boxes of pudding mix that tint was just not there. This is just a great spin off a chocolate chip cookie recipe and it is going on my Christmas platters this year. I highly recommend this recipe either as is or with my tweaks...it is tasty either way you go!",

My RM has asked me to make some more so it looks like these will definitely be a permanent fixture in our dessert rotation. I'm tempted to increase the pistachios to 1/3 cup and the maraschinos to 3/4 cup not because it's necessary but because I'd like to have more of them.

My store did not have marachino cherries, so I used some pitted dark (sweet) cherries in heavy syrup, drained very well. And, they worked perfect in this recipe. Chocolate chips only come in a 12 oz bag so I used that. From the recipe I got 68 cookies using a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop. I will definitely make these again. They were soft, chewy, and very flavorful. They will be on my Christmas cookie list next year. Thank you!",
