I prepared the casserole through Step 3 the day before, and refrigerated it overnight.  Immediately before baking the next day, I added the crumb topping (I also added 10 minutes to the baking time, because it had been in the refrigerator).\nI took the suggestion of another reviewer for adding even more flavor, and saut\u00e9ed a bit of (sweet) yellow onion in the butter until translucent, before adding the soup.  I used the grating disk and feeding tube of my food processor to grate the cooked and peeled potatoes with speed.   To conclude:  the end result was a VERY creamy casserole.  I do believe that when I make it again, I will make it with 6 LARGE potatoes, so that the consistency will be firmer and more potato-y.",

Due to time constraints, I don't grate the potatoes but just cut them into quarters after boiling and taking the skins off, and then mash them in the pan a bit with a fork. Works just as good as grating. Also we rarely have a box of cornflakes in our house so we just cook them with a bit of extra cheese on top. They're so yummy right out of the oven with the cheese all melted. Plus they're great the next day too!",
