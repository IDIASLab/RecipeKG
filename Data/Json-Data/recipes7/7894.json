But it turned out nicely. I also rolled my dough about twice as big because 4 x 4 made tiny appetizer style runzas. I wanted a meal sized runza. But that worked too. I through a half teaspoon of pepper into the meat mixture but next time I'll spice it up a bit more. It was a bit bland for our taste. But I'll definitely make these again!",

It was also simple enough to customize a bit. I halved the recipe and this worked for all ingredients except the flour: I found I needed to use about 2 3/4 cups of flour to get a nice, roll-out consistency. I also used the full amount of yeast. Followed the rest of the steps, except I added salt, pepper, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the meat and put half a piece of American cheese into each Runza. I also added an egg wash and a pinch of salt on the outside of each roll for golden brown deliciousness. Just YUM. Thank you!",
