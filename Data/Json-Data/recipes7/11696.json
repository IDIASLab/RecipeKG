Mine came out light and fluffy and I was able to get 16 muffins out of this recipe.  I use silicone muffin cups that hold 70ml per cup.  I filled these a third of the way to the top.  The puff up nicely too.  Thanks Cheerios for sharing.",

I got 18 out of this recipe but I guess I have smaller muffin pans because that is pretty typical for me. I thought they were okay--too chocolate-y and not enough blueberry for me--but hubs liked them. I made these a tad more scone-like because I was going to use milk in place of the cream but ran out of that so I used plain Greek yogurt instead. That worked perfectly well but made them more dense than the recipe submitter likely intended them to be. All in all decent muffins with chocolate and blueberry if you like that combo. Thanks for the recipe!",
