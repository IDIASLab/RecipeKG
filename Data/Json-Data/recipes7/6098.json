This recipe came about after I was gifted with a large bag of mangoes by an anonymous Maui neighbor. I was determined to use every single one of them and by adapting an apple pie recipe, I came up with this delicious pie. Another bonus.....the sweetness of the mangoes reduces the need for added sugar.",
