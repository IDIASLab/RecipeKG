The glaze is delicious and the sweetness of it really compliments the spice cookie nicely.  The only suggestion I could think to make would be to add a little more orange juice to the glaze mixture to give it a little more orange flavor, but otherwise this cookie was amazing.  A word of caution, the recipe makes a lot of glaze and even after brushing a decent amount onto the cookies I still had some left over.  I'm not complaining though, as I used the leftovers on a few slices of pumpkin bread I made, and it was delicious.  Definitely a keeper that's likely to make an appearance at future Christmases (if I can wait that long to make it again).",

I would've liked a bit more orange flavor but i am not one to mess much with a recipe. i cut the glaze ingredients in half due to another reviewer saying there was a lot leftover. The amount was then perfect. The glaze was a bit too sweet for my taste...i think it overpowers the taste of the cookie instead of compliments it therefore i gave this 4 stars. keep in mind that this cookie spreads alot so if you are like me and don't roll out the dough and opt for just making flattened balls keep them around 1\" to 1 1/2\" in diameter. overall this cookie was yummy! will make again. thanks!",

Crisp on the outside spongey on the inside. If you like less of a spongey cookie like me I advice making the squares smaller and leaving them in the oven for 2 to 4 minutes longer.",

The orange peel in the marmalade adds a very pretty detail to the shiny glaze on the cookie. Cooking these was more problematic. The instructions are unclear about the full size of the cut cookie. I made mine about 2 inches square and they really spread out in the oven closer to 3 inches. After that I just rolled the dough into about 1-inch balls and patted them down into circles on the cookie pan. Depending on thickness some of my batches were done at 10 minutes. Keep an eye on these as they bake. It also takes a while for the glaze on these to set. I tried to speed up the setting process in the fridge overnight but that didn't help make them less sticky. This is a very tasty cookie. I will make them again!",
