I used Tropical Punch Kool-Aid. Makes for a VERY weirdly flavored and fantastically RED pickle. An excellent conversation starter for drunks, kids and oddballs. Thanks for the recipe, Carolyn!",

Take the pickles and cut them in half lengthwise and place back in the jar. This allows the inside of the pickle to be colored too. Then add two packages of any red koolaid (Cherry and Tropical Punch is the norm) and 2 and a quarter cups of sugar to the brine and mix til sugar is dissolved. Pour red brine back into the jar and let the pickles sit in the fridge for two weeks. Kids love them. Kids around here also like taking a dill pickle and sprinkling a package of koolaid singles onto it. Even though it's not the norm I like to slice a few of the pickles instead of halving them. Then I make peanut butter and pickle sandwiches with the slices. Also having a few slices is good for skeptics to try so they don't waste a whole pickle if they don't like them!:)",
