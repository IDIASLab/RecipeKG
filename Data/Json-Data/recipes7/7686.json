                "reviewBody": "This cinnamon bread is excellent. I followed the recipe ingredients but made rolls instead of a loaf and added raisins. I LOVE the filling so I doubled the ingredients to satisfy my sweet tooth and I'm glad I did because to my liking there was barely enough to cover both rectangles. I added 1 cup Thomson raisins, soaked for 30 min. in 1/4 cup brandy with a 1/4 tsp sugar sprinkled over them (kills the bitterness)  stirring a few times to coat them evenly. The dough is great to work with and not sticky at all. When I sprinkled the raisins over the sugar mix I put a sheet of wax paper to cover it  and ran the rolling pin over it lightly a few times to press the mixture into the dough (makes rolling it up easier and less filling leaks out). I rolled it up from the long end and sliced it into 1\" pieces and popped them into Pam-sprayed muffin tins. I always brush my rolls with soft butter and sprinkle a little brown sugar over them, about 1/8 tsp on each (to keep some yummy, gooey syrup on the tops). It only took 15 min to turn golden with syrup spread over the tops.Even though I doubled the filling very little of it leaked out. I lifted each to a rack and while still warm I drizzled the tops with basic milk/icing sugar  glaze. When they cooled I drizzled a 2nd layer of glaze over the tops as it will not soak into the roll and disappear.  Then I ate 4 of them! My goodness, this beautiful bread makes accidental rolls a great mistake. Thank you MN Nice for sharing.",

This keeps the layers from separating when it is baked.  I did use too much egg and my mixture was too runny.  Next time I will use 1-2 Tablespoons of egg instead of a whole one.  There will definitely be a next time!",

This bread turned out so well, just like a cinnamon roll in loaf form. I don't have a bread machine so I did have to adjust the directions for use in my stand mixer. I combined the white sugar and warm milk in my mixer bowl and added the yeast to proof. Once proofed I mixed in the eggs and softened butter until the butter was broken up into chunks and the eggs were mixed in. I then added the flour/salt that had already been mixed to combine. I let the dough hook do all the kneading and when finished I lightly oiled the bowl and the top of the dough, covered with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled. From that point on I followed the recipe except for doubling the sugar/cinnamon part of the filling. I made one loaf with walnuts and one without since my husband isn't crazy about them. We can't wait to try this bread toasted tomorrow morning. The only change I'll make next time is to brush the dough with an egg wash before baking so it comes out nice and glossy. Highly recommend!",

I could tell from the recipe that there would not be enough filling without the walnuts and since I planned to omit them I too doubled the cinnamon/sugar mixture.

The kids slathered their slices in homemade apple butter a friend gave us for Christmas but even plain this stuff is heavenly!",

I'm not sure where I went wrong, but my dough didn't rise and I basically ended up with 2 cinnamon roll logs. They didn't taste terrible, but it would've been nice if they had some more air in them.",
