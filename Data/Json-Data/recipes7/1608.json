A few more and it was perfect. The last step of the recipe can be reduced though. The 1/3 cup powdered sugar and the 1/2 tsp of the chipotle can be halved. I used it all and it makes the bar harder to eat as a bar. It requires a fork and a plate. When I make it next I will only use a dusting of that part. It's more fun to eat with your hands!",

Very harsh tasting. I'll save the crust (but halve it) and I'll save the custard (but tweak it). I have tons of leftovers and that never happens with my crowd.",
