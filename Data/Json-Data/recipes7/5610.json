Definitely not for those counting calories...although I'm sure it could be lightened up a bit if you wanted to! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I also had to sub Sprite for the Mountain Dew as I didn't have any on hand. These baked up beautifully and made the house smell wonderful. They were perfect with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream and the side -YUM!",

This is really awesome with cinnamon ice cream or fresh whipped cream. GREAT white trash party offering. EDITED REVIEW: I made this the other day using reduced fat crescent roll half the amount of butter half the amount of brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar and Diet Canada Dry. Even using the lower fat ingredients this was still freaking awesome. I ate one portion the boys literally ate the rest in 15 minutes. My husband even remarked that it's better than it usually is!",

I am not certain if I didn't read the reviews in their entirety but didn't know this: REMOVE DUMPLINGS FROM PAN WHILE HOT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKING OUT OF THE OVEN. Once cooled the sugar and soda caramelizes and it is extremely difficult to remove dumplings. Also add sugar and cinnamon to apples too for added flavor. I paired this with butter pecan ice cream and my significant other loved it. Will make again for those I love!",
