My sister begs her to make them for her as soon as she sees tomatoes growing big and green on the vines. While most recipes call for breadcrumbs and oil, this one calls for flour and has you fry the tomatoes in butter, which helps give these an incredible flavor.",

I found this recipe to be fantastic.  My only concern was that duplicating it as written would have produced a dish with far more saturated fat than I was willing to accept (one serving of this side dish would have meant ingesting 50% more than the recommended daily allowance of saturated fat from the American Heart Association, even for healthy adults without heart problems).  I realize that this is not a diet dish, but a simple substitution resulted in 1/3 of the saturated fat, 1/2 the cholesterol, and still delicious flavor.  I substituted a 50-50 blend of olive oil and Smart Balance Buttery Spread with flaxseed oil, along with a cut from two eggs to one, resulting in a heart-healthy recipe without any apparent loss  of flavor.  I don't want to sound like a food Nazi, but there simply is no reason to cook the tomatoes in a cup of butter when there are much more healthful alternatives that do not mean giving up anything!  This recipe is a keeper.",

I would have liked to have seen the flour stick better to the tomatoes but it could have been the type tomato I used had a smoother skin.  This makes a nice side vegetable for seafood.

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe and definitely a keeper. The tomatoes are tangy crunchy and slightly sweet from the sugar. I've been adding sugar (I normally use brown sugar instead of white) to my fried green tomatoes for years and was excited to find a recipe that had sugar in the ingredient list. However I traditionally use bread crumbs (regular or Panko whichever I have on hand) or flour and cornmeal. This time I decided to deviate from my normal pattern and use the flour with the egg/milk mixture this recipe calls for and I'm glad I did. The texture of the tomatoes is completely different and since you're using just plain flour instead of seasoned bread crumbs you're not masking the flavor of the tomatoes. This was full-fledged pure tomato flavor. And they were delicious. I had to take a photo and post it because my tomatoes came out looking almost exactly like the tomatoes in the original photo.",
