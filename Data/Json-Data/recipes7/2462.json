I sliced the cucumbers using the side of my cheese grater and quickly sliced the cucumbers and onion very thinly. I omitted the celery. I'd definitely make this again especially for a summer bbq.",

When I attempted to make the dressing for this salad, the proportions didn't work to my liking, so I ended up discarding half the dressing and adding more mayonnaise to cut the strong vinegar taste and reduce the soupy consistency (and a tad more sugar!)... If you prefer the original proportions, I might also recommend trying a slightly more mild rice wine vinegar.",
