I didn't have scallions so I used regular green onions and I thought it was fine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding the cashews. I was making my meal overnight for a dinner the next day so I actually chilled it during the day in the refrigerator. I pulled the chicken pieces out of the sauce and let them warm in the crockpot while I reheated all the sauce on the stove. As part of the reheating I brought the sauce to a low boil and added the cashews. It turned out perfectly - the cashews were soft but firm and retained their shape well. The whole mixture of flavors was really delicious. I was afraid of the fish sauce after reading other reviews on the website but there was nothing \"fishy\" tasting about it at all. I will definitely make this again!!",
