Thankfully I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet! There is still the extra sweet with the caramels and glaze so 1 cup of sugar is plenty if you use granny smith apples. If you used a slightly sweeter apple you might want to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup. To combat the extra sweet I sprinkled a little sea salt over the top it goes so well with the caramel! I also used 12 caramels in this as it covered a little more evenly in the pan. I will definitely make this again!",
