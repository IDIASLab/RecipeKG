Going by weight ratio makes it super-easy to adjust to make just the right amount of concentrate. For the easiest cleanup I use a bowl with a spout for the steeping process and filter it into a Chemex brewer. The ground of your coffee also matters a lot for cold-brewing. Use a coarse grind as for a French press for best results.",
