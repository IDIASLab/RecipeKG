Second there was way too much batter for two nine inch cake pans...I ended up with dome shaped cakes that over-flowed in the oven. The cake also ended up with a crisp outer crust... we like it like that but if you are looking for super soft/moist cake this is not it. However I liked the homemade flavor of the batter. It tasted a little like southern sweet buttermilk cornbread. I would never have thought to combine the condensed sweet milk and sour cream and vinegar but even in batter form it was tasty! With buttercream frosting and a lemon filling this cake turned out like what I imagine was made in the early settler days homestyle and delicious.",

I hate to give bad reviews but I was VERY DISAPPOINTED.
