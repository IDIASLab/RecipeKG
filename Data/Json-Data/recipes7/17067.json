This dough was really dry! I hoped when I put it in the refrigerator that it would settle down and the flour would absorb the little liquid there was. But alas the next day when I took out the dough it was a mass that crumbled like beach sand when I tried to touch it. I managed to make two test cookies baked them and they were extremely dry and unpleasant and the raspberry flavor was masked by the strong chocolate. Perhaps there was too much cocoa powder (and no I did not use Dutch processed) or just not enough liquid. What I will do is make my regular chocolate crinkle cookie recipe and roll in some of the expensive raspberry powder I created!",
