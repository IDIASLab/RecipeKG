                "reviewBody": "UPDATE*** As the submitter of this recipe I would suggest to those of you worried about over browning bottoms, to use  two cookie sheets together to bake on.  My baking sheets are a heavy gauge metal and I also use a silpat on top of that so mine bake up just right.  However, if you have a thin sheet, doubling up will help insulate the bottom and prevent over browning issues. Parchment paper will keep dough from sticking but I do suggest a good spray with PAM prior to use.***  These are easy and fun.  My kid love 'em!  We have made different kinds.... Turkey, beef, sausage, cheese....kids like the cheese dogs best!  These never last long so I make a double batch and individually freeze the second batch for a special lunch treat!  When I freeze for lunches I leave the salt off as it causes the bread to \"sweat\" while defrosting.  The dough is also wonderful for regular pretzel or bite size pretzels.  I highly recommend the recipe \"Clone of a Pretzel Dip\" from this site to accompany the pretzel bites!",

It was perfect for one package of hot dogs. The grandkids are going to love them. Thank you WFDM for sharing your AMAZING recipe and a special thank you for recommending my dip! UPDATE - Today I made the pretzel dogs with cheese. I used American cheese which I sliced with a pizza wheel making it thinner than the dough strips. I pressed the cheese into the dough strips a little then wrapped the dogs. It was necessary to seal the edges between the strips so they would hold up in the water. This all worked well; but when I baked them the cheese oozed out the ends. I posted a photo to show the oozing cheese. They tasted great but my conclusion is they really don't need the cheese. I made these to freeze because I found that they freeze so well. I put them in the microwave frozen and heat at half power. They taste as good as fresh baked! Try these you don't know what you're missing!",

I replaced the paddle with the dough hook and set it on medium low speed for about 6 minutes to knead the dough.
