I added a can of diced tomatoes, a Granny Smith apple, and some nutmeg to make it a little more Fall-ish and to sneak in some more \"good stuff\". I used half the amount of Kale to ensure it wouldn't be too bitter for my kids. All in all, the soup was delicious. I wish I hadn't used 12 cups of broth as the recipe called for since I felt it was a little thin. I think 10 c would've been perfect. My husband also wished it had some more beans as he is not vegetarian, and I agree. Don't forget the bread...yum!",
