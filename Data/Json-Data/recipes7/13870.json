Made the recipe exactly as written otherwise and loved the delicate blend of flavors for our plant based/gluten free palates. I think we enjoyed it especially because it was a crisp fall evening just right for a pot of lovely soup. One more treat were the colors in our bowls. Wish I would have taken a picture. We both ate seconds and that speaks for itself.",
