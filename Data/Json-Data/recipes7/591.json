I was sure not to press it completely through so as not to have individual slices of apples but rather a 'flower'. I stuffed them and them and pressed them shut. I kept them in a little longer just to make sure the egg was cooked (I have a thing with raw eggs). The mixture was not very tasty. Could've used a full tbsp of sugar (at least) and I'm not even a fan of sweet things!",
