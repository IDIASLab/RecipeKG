But I see it has a bad rating but no reviews so I'm going to go ahead and review it so that others might be willing to try it. Please forgive me. I halved the recipe since it's just me tonight--probably should've quartered it but oh well. I'm really not too sure about the dough--it's sweet from the sugar and I had to add about 1 1/2 c of flour to get it a little less runny. It still ended up like pancake dough but I figure I could deal with that and it baked up well enough. I don't like blue cheese dressing nor did I have any so I eliminated that. I also used sour cream instead of mayo and mixed it up with the refried beans as I always have difficulty spreading refried beans. I didn't have chili but I did have red kidney beans so I used that in place of the chili. Also for flavor I added some taco seasoning. Again I know I changed it a lot but I was happy with my modifications. The only thing I'm not that thrilled with was the pizza dough--again the thickness could be due to my halving the recipe--some dough recipes are not that forgiving but I didn't really like the sweet taste of it and it ended up somewhat crispy. I'd be willing to try the recipe again but with a different dough. And maybe if the bf's home and I have the other ingredients I'll stay truer to the recipe! Thanks for the recipe.",

For one I had to cut down the sugar by 50% which I still think it was too sweet. Maybe next time I'll try only 1-2 tablespoons. I also added 2/3 cup of cornmeal but I feel like that wasn't enough. I like that it didn't take yeast but the crust was too soft to be considered a pizza. I also don't care for blue cheese dressing or hot mayonnaise so I left those out. I also made my own re-fried beans using black beans and garlic. I I added just green chilies instead of the rotel tomatoes and topped the pizza with shredded sharp cheddar. For garnish I did use the lettuce and tomatoes but added sour cream and salsa for each person to add to taste.",
