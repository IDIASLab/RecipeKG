I never mastered the secret to awesome greens until a friend shared that cooking the smoked ham hock until falling falling off the bone first.  Remove the cooked meat and cook the greens in the deliciously reduced smoked ham hock broth for the most intensely flavored greens.  \nThis recipe is the first I tried following that suggestion.   It came out delicious,  just like my Louisiana elders made.  As others have mentioned,  I added red pepper flakes.  Just due to personal taste, I like to sprinkle my individual serving with vinegar, rather than adding it to the entire pot.  \nI also find that greens harvested in the winter are not bitter like summer grown collards, and don't require sugar.",
