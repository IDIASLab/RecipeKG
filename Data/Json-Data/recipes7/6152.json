This may be our new favorite pancake recipe! NOTE: Because I cut this recipe in half, I had to figure out what to do about the half egg the recipe called for. I just used two full eggs and cut back on the extra milk called for. Wa-la, problem solved.",

                "reviewBody": "I really got excited about a pancake recipe without added oil so I wanted my kids to try this one. For starters I had to make a substitution the buttermilk-I did the old standby of adding a teaspoon of lemon juice for each cup of milk. Because I keep a container of blended oatmeal I wasn't too worried about soaking the oats. These were the only changes I made to the original recipe before tasting them. It is a HUGE recipe and pretty easy to fix with ingredients normally on hand (sans buttermilk) so that's a plus. They mixed up nicely and I supposed the cinnamon would be a flavor boost. I used Pam to spray my griddle with good success-no sticking. The pancakes when finished were cracked and dry on the outside. I attributed this to the lack of oil with the recipe. The texture inside was ok but the taste was on the bland side. We couldn't even taste the cinnamon so that measurement could easily be doubled. After my first 2 batches of pancakes were made I added 3 TBSP. of vegetable oil for a more tender pancake. That was so much better! Then I added frozen blueberries to the pancakes and that made these AWESOME and still kept with the hearty and healthy bent to them! The blueberries brought flavor to them and my kids and I liked these so much more after these 2 additions. So a 5 star with the changes of blueberries or chopped apples the oil and you have a great hearty and healthy breakfast.",

I've made this twice now and sub'd it according to my tastes (and lower caloric preferences): 1) 1% milk vinegar for buttermilk 2) white whole wheat flour for all flour 3) Splenda sugar blend for sugar 4) 1 tbsp of vanilla for cinnamon 5) egg substitute for eggs 6) Threw in 3 tbsp chia seeds at the very last minute for texture. Using 1/4 cup I came out with 23 pancakes the first time and after adding in 1/4 cup milk my second round came out with 22 flatter (but still yummy) pancakes. EXTRA NOTE: Be sure to spray the pan really good - and I mean REALLY good as these will stick otherwise. Thanks for the wonderful recipe jpandmary!",

But I liked it better after I added some applesauce more milk apple pie spice and even mini chocolate chips to some and raisins to some. I think I might like the texture (more like traditional buttermilk) if grinding the oats first. But I encourage you to try it and make it your own. Top it with syrup nutella etc. You wont be sorry!",
