At first I thought this was awesome, but after a couple of bites it started to turn my stomach because it was so sweet. I should have known better when I saw the 1/2 cup of sugar in the ingredients, but I gave it a shot anyways. I tried to remedy this by adding in some more salt & pepper and some basil - it helped a bit, but it was still not as palatable as I would hope for. I just personally am not a fan of sweet vinaigrette dressings. I would like to try this again though with some fresh summer veggies from the garden. Next time I think I will try it with apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and dill and omit the sugar. \nIf you like sweet vinaigrette though, you're going to love this.",
