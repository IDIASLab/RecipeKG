I made it to serve as an afternoon snack with Tostito chips (lime flavoured) and what was left over was served as a condiment with our chicken fajitas at supper. It was soooo good I even made a double batch later in the evening to cut up the rest of our fresh pineapple and let the salsa chill and blend flavours overnight. I made the recipe as is with the exception of: using green pepper instead of red (that's what we had); leaving out the jalape\u00f1o pepper (we didn't have any); we did add the optional garlic; and added 10 grape tomatoes (each cut into 8 small pieces) to add some red colour. I can't wait to have some again tomorrow!! Yum!! (If I could I'd give it 10 stars!) The photo submitted was of another batch made with yellow peppers and the grape tomatoes. I like to add 1/4 tsp of chili powder for a bit of a kick in the absence of Jalape\u00f1o peppers.",
