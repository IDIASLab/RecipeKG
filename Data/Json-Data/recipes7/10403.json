I did not have crystallized ginger so I omitted it. I also chilled the batter for 15 minutes before rolling them into balls and then coating in granulated sugar. (I'll chill for 30 next time) This kept the cookies from going too flat. I agree with another reviewer that I could taste the baking soda ever so slightly so next time I will try her suggestion of baking powder and soda. I think the ginger amount was just right. I did not have all spice so I used 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves. I'll certainly be making again kids and husband gobbled them up!!",

I changed one thing on the second batch because even though there is molasses it is not enough to cut the bitterness of the baking soda. I reduced the soda to 1/2 teaspoon and added 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead. That seemed to give it enough leavening power. You could also add cream of tartar in an equal amount to the soda. The second batch I made with this alteration was perfect and I will definitely make them again.",

It's very affordable if you get it from the bulk aisle of a larger grocery store. Just chop it finely and you'll get an excellent extra spiciness. I only made two changes which I borrowed from other comments: 1) I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar which worked fine but honestly there's not much need to double down on the molasses here so next time I'll try the recipe as stated. 2) I rolled the balls of dough in white sugar before baking them which gave them a wonderful look and feel.",
