They're almost too pretty to eat, but of course you must try them, and are they ever good!!! I love them with Chai tea.

I'm Australian and I had never heard of any biscuits ( cookies ) like these especially with the anise seeds and the length of time between cutting out and baking. Leaving them in a tin overnight made them chewy rather than very hard as they were when they first came out of the oven. I cut them out with a diamond shape cutter but may have to invest in a proper springerle mould for next time. We don't have these in Australia but thank God for the Internet! I especially liked the fact that they are so different from most other cookies because of the anise seeds and the fact that they are not as sweet as most cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect - everyone loved them and I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks so much Jan from Geelong Australia",
