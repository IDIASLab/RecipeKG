My first attempt at making home made pickled beets....I pulled all the beets in my garden after the first freeze.....washed cut about an inch above where the stems started then boiled whole for about 15 min. until I could pierce easily with a fork cooled then rubbed the skins off. Cut stem ends off and added the boiled vinegar sugar and water and poured over the beets (mostly whole some halved) and some hard boiled eggs along with some salt and pepper and a few whole peppercorns. I also added a few cups of the beet water that I boiled the beets in. DELISH!!! I hope for great beet harvests every year and I will can these in pints with my pressure canner!
