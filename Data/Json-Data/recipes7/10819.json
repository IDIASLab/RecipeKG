I bake them for a total of 23 minutes and they came out perfect, not dry and not mushy!

The muffins are delicious and have a nice moist texture yet due to oats, coconut and flax seed, has more substance to it than a typical muffin.  I was thrilled that I was able to use my ripe bananas and blueberries in 1 recipe- not to mention using flax seed which is great health benefits (Flax seed is an excellent source of fiber, Omega-3 fatty acids and antio xidants.).
