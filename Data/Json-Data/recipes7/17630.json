I did not have fish sauce, so I threw in a glop (heaping TBS) of hoisin sauce.  I did not have sweet chili sauce but added 1 TBS of spicy chili sauce instead.  I skipped the cayenne and chili pepper flakes only because I didn't want to make it too spicy.  According to hubby, I could have added a little more spice, so maybe 2 TBS of spicy chili sauce or maybe add some flakes to taste.  Aside from those couple of changes, I stuck to the recipe.  Honestly, I was super happy with the results.  Thank you for an easy yet delicious recipe!",
