All the recipes online wanted toasted coconut which was way too fancy for sand that was basically serving as a decoration for my son's Finding Nemo party. Everyone couldn't get over how much this looked like real sand!!! People were putting it on top of their cake and ice cream once they heard it was edible. Tasty and esthetically pleasing! Great recipe!",
