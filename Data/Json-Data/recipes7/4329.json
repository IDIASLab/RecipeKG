I whipped the potato mixture for 11 minutes and it never became \"fluffy\". I used canned yams which is supposed to be an acceptable substitution but it wasn't. It was basically a puree. Because this wasn't fluffy and it had the eggs in it the texture a bit gross. I really enjoyed the pineapple topping but I would reduce the sugar by a third next time. I think I will try this one more time with fresh sweet potatoes and see if the texture is better if not I will just make my praline yams and top with the reduced sugar pineapple mixture.

This was a 'delish dish' souffle... high fives cinnalady! My personal preference was butter instead of margarine - everything else was perfect. The pineapple topping was really good! Note: I believe there is a typo under Directions #2: It reads \"3 eggs\" for the souffle; I believe it should read 2 eggs as the Ingredients call for plus the 1 egg to mix with the pineapple topping. Is this correct cinnalady?",

I use the 3 eggs that it calls for in the directions 1 more for the topping (4 eggs total). It's baked up nice and fluffy for me every time. As with any baking make sure your eggs are at room temp when you whip them in so they incorporate well. I would recommend that you allow yourself time to let it cool about 20 minutes before serving. The only time I've made a substitution was when I was given a load of Acorn squash and tried substituting it for the potatoes. I did some draining to make sure it wasn't too moist - otherwise the substitution worked very well. It had a slightly different texture but puffed up great and only lasted one night in the fridge!",
