I could not find juniper berries so I threw in a shot of gin to try to make up for it :)  I did not discard the vegetables at the end because I didn't wan't to lose the amazing flavor of the carmelized vegetables. Instead I used my immersion blender to puree the vegis right into the gravy. I also doubled the crushed ginger snaps because we love that ginger flavor. Sprinkled the completed dish with a few more crushed gingersnaps and wow! Make this....you won't be sorry! Thanks for sharing this amazing dish Chef John! UPDATE: I decided to try this with a chuck pot roast and it turned out delicious. I followed everything except I put the roast in a covered dutch oven and baked at 275 for five hours. Delish and fall apart pot roast!",
