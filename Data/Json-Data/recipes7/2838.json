I baked them for 40 minutes and then let them sit out over night. 1 hr out of the oven they were a bit wet in the center but by the next day PERFECT. They certainly didn't make 60 cookies though. I got 1 cookie sheet of medium sized cookies, maybe 12-15. I will make these again for sure.",

It took us over 40 minutes to get the \"Stiff peaks\" to form and we did add the sugar \"gradually\". Plus the recipes says it makes 60 cookies. We made 15.
