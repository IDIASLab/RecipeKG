I tried this with homemade coconut milk and it actually worked. You do need to keep everything super cold but I was able to even do it by hand. However, I omitted the sugar and vanilla in each attempt. Also, beware when you put a dollop of this on a warm piece of cake. All that trouble you went through melts away! :-) UPDATE: I have just made another batch of this adding some espresso powder and cocoa and it is delicious. Thank you for the recipe.",

I followed the remainder of the recipe with the exception of adding whipped cream stabilizer that I had from King Arthur Flour company (I got it off their website- ingredients are powdered gelatin). Mine did not whip in the sense it did not become airy or develop into a larger air induced volume of frosting to fill the bowl as whipped cream would normally do. My daughter has made this and said she has gotten it to whip. I did have a nice spreadable frosting which had a great tecture. I almost think mine was too cold. It did make a nice frosting of about 1/2 a cup. It was stable at room temperature for hours during a party. Everyone loved it. My goal was a gluten and dairy free cupcake for a friend. I am not sure if the gelatin knocks this out of the vegan category. I topped with shaved coconut. I do not find the coconut milk to have a strong coconut flavor at all. It you want you can change out flavorings as the coconut milk seems to be a good carrier product for different extracts.",
