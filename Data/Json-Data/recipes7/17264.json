The result while making them was a very crumbly dough. But working it with my hands helped soften the coconut oil and make it a very firm dough. Chilling did not help as I couldn't roll it out without it breaking apart so I rolled them into individual balls pressed flat and cookie cut out. The result was a very dark only light sweet and kinda dry cookie. Next time I will add a little more wet ingredient. But for a first try it wasn't bad",
