MY GOSH, this is G-O-O-D stuff - restaurant quality for sure!!! Because I was cooking for two people (i.e. my fiance and I), I halved the recipe. I used my mini food chopper/processor (rather than 'dig' out my blender) and slowly added the oil as I pulsed (I used the chop function in a pulse fashion - every few seconds or so). Perfect! Oh, and I purchased smoked Spanish paprika at my local spice shop (it REALLY makes a difference and does add that extra complex dimension to the finished product). I also made sure to use REAL stone ground mustard, not the dijon variety. Did this make a differnce or not? Who knows, but this sure was tasty! DC Girl's vinaigrette will from now on be my \"house\" dressing of choice when entertaining friends/family. It is just that good! Thanks for sharing, DC Girl. I am forever indebted to you :) ",

Absolutely loved it and didn't change a thing (I normally tend to alter the oil/vinegar as I find the ratios to be off for our liking...usually too much oil and not tangy enough). The smoked paprika is a must gives a wonderful and distinct flavour to the dressing that would not be the same with plain paprika. Sweet smoky tangy...mmmm good!

I used spicy brown mustard instead of stone ground just due to what was on hand and my only onion was the size of a softball and I didn't feel like cutting in to it so I used a couple of green onions and some onion powder instead. Those changes were simply for my convenience at the time. However I did reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp and felt it had plenty of salt. The recipe as is would get 5 stars otherwise. It's fabulous! It reminds me a LOT of the vinaigrette style bbq sauce from Salt Lick BBQ in Austin TX. I'll make this again and again.",
