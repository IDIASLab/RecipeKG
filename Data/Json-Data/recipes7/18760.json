After I melted the chocolate I tempered the egg and sugar mixture by adding 2 large spoons of egg yolk / sugar mix in a small bowl with a bit of hot chocolate then quickly added it back into the eggs. I then mixed the chocolate by large soup spoonfuls into the eggs. I whipped the cream with 1/4 C sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract before I added it into the chocolate and egg yolk mixture. Topped with more fresh whipped cream and it was absolutely delicious! Not too sweet more of an adult mousse but the kids loved it too!!",
