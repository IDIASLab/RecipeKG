Not to mention it tastes better than the vanilla wafers you can buy at the store! You can make the cookies bigger if you'd like, they just won't have as crispy of an outside. We like to add a slice of banana between two cookies, dip them in chocolate, and then freeze them (;",

                "reviewBody": "excellent! for the most part, I kept ingredients as listed, but changed the method to combat the spreading and thin result others reviewed.I always bake with butter flavor crisco,  bake with parchment paper and only bake on sheets that have cooled off, that helps spreading.   after mixing dough, take the time to roll them into longs rolls of dough as in refrigerator cookies.  yeah, it adds a little prep time, but it probably saves time in the long run. I quadrupled the recipe and formed the dough into around 7 long bread stick size wax paper tubes.  let them sit in fridge all day, and only pulled one tube out at a time, slicing them into pieces the thickness of checker pieces. molded them a little as i placed them on the cookie sheet.  got 27 cookies per sheet, at 4x7 rows. finished cookies were perfectly round, uniform and nearly identical in size to Nilla Wafers from the store.  made a total of 18 dozen little, delicious, beautiful, impressive cookies! filled to galon size ziplock bags, needed extra cuz recipe.   Am using them in banana pudding, will update this review after trying them out in the recipe.  By the way, the amount of grease that is on the wax paper when you are slicing them is alarming, but the finished product is absolutely perfect.  for the sake of health, next time i will try to reduce the amount of butter/shortening just a tad to see if i still like the cookie.  overall, this is gonna be my go-to vanilla wafer cookie for sure! thanks, usmcwifey!!!!!!",

After reading  several reviews, a common theme I saw was that the cookies spread a lot, so I increased the flour slightly to 1 and 1/2 cups and also increased the vanilla to 1 and 1/2 tblsp.  The shape held perfectly and after nine minutes, they were golden brown on the bottom.  The only thing I miss is the crunchiness if the store bought kind, but since I didn't make a banana pudding, that didn't really matter.  I will definitely make again and I may try decreasing the heat a little and leaving them in slightly longer to try to get them crunchy. Very yummy!",

They started to overbrown on the edges after 9-10 min but I needed most of them for crumbs in another recipe so I left them in to make sure they were crunchy. I did start chilling my pan in the fridge between batches and that helped the browning. I put the dough in a baggie and clipped off a corner to squeeze dollops on the cookie sheet which worked very good. I also used the last little bit to make a snowman by spacing the dollops about 1/2 to 3/4 inch a apart:)",
