The bread is highly spiced so makes a perfect accompaniment for Danish open faced sandwiches (smorebrod) and is usually seen served on a Christmas holiday table.  Perfect for those people who like a spiced twist to their daily bread.",

I made a few changes because of Hubby's diabetes - no white flour allowed. Doubled the rye flour and made up the rest with whole wheat and whole wheat \"pastry\" flour. Had to add about 1 more cup of flour total and substituted Splenda for the 1/3 C sugar. But it came out great and didn't taste like \"health food\" at all! The aroma while it was baking was HEAVENLY.",

I ground the seeds and it worked out beautifully. I did have a problem with getting the bread to rise so I pitched my yeast and next time I will make sure I use fresher yeast. I shared a loaf with my neighbors and they loved it too. Thanks for sharing.",

I couldn't believe I made something this good--it seriously tastes like something you'd order at a bakery. The texture is perfect, and not at all dried out the way whole grain homemade bread sometimes turns out. I don't have a bread machine, so I let it rise 2 hours, separated it into two loaf pans and let it rise another hour. I didn't have the anise or fennel, and I doubled the caraway. I will make this again and again. This is possibly my favorite bread of all time, and I wasn't a fan of rye until now.",
