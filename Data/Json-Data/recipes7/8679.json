Another tip to better pretzels is heat a pot of boiling water.  I use an upside down cookie sheet with paper and after the dough raises I put the Pretzels in a bath of boiling water and baking soda for about 10 to 30 seconds.  Then I put them on the parchment paper and brush them with egg whites and salt them and bake at a higher temperature of 425 to really get a crunchy and chewy pretzel.",

For me, the amount of flour is excessive, so I would only add a little as I go otherwise I believe you will end up with a very stiff, unworkable dough.  2.  The baking time was much more than listed on the recipe, so adjust the time according to your oven as every oven is different.  But, having said that, how could you not enjoy homemade pretzels?",

Stick to the ingredients and you shouldn't have any problems if you substitute ingredients then I can't really say. I use vegetable shortening. Main thing I'd like to point out is to make sure you MELT THE SHORTENING! I was moving pretty quick cooking other things etc. and I didn't melt the shortening the dough was impossible and I thought I added too much flour. Also I wouldn't use packed cups of flour I just scooped out rough cups of flour with out packing them and everything comes out excellent. Great recipe!",
