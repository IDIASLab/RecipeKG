The size of this tasty little cookie is perfect the sweetness is perfect the rosemary flavor is perfect the crisp is perfect... What a divine addition to our holiday cookie tray.

Every time I try a sliced cookie recipe the slices always end up looking like little malformed blocks of dough so I end up rolling the pieces up and flattening them out into little discs and they always end up less flat than they're supposed to. This time was no exception for me--don't know what my malfunction is but obviously it's there. So I ended up baking for about 18-20 minutes and they were little cookies with little muffin type tops. These are a sweet cookie not savory at all with a punch of rosemary. They are okay by themselves but better with tea. These were fun to make (minus my inability to roll and slice)--maybe one of htese days I will learn how to cut cookie slices and revisit slicing these little cookies. Thanks for the recipe!",
