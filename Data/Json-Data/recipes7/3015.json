After 35 minutes I used a mixture of coffee cinnamon nutmeg ground cloves melted butter milk and confectioners sugar and poured it over the top. It took another 25 minutes to finish baking. After I flipped it I sifted the same cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves/sugar mixture over the top of the cake. The bottom had caramelized. It was moist just the right amount of sweetness and had a perfect flavor. Will definitely be making again!",
