I followed all directions except when it came time to put them in the olive oil, I put them on my stoneware pan with all the marinade (which made for a nice breading) drizzled 1/4 olive oil over top, and baked at 375 for 47 minutes. I turned the chicken half way through baking.  The dipping sauce thickened up just perfectly!  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still plenty sweet.

I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 cup olive oil and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  I used the corn starch mix to my preferred thickness.  Served dish with broccoli and white rice.  My fiance just went off to work to brag how great a chef I am!  SO EASY!  If your batter stuck to the pan, you might want to leave chicken in fridge longer before frying and make sure your oil is hot enough.",

I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and to be honest, it could have been 1/4 or under even. It was just awesome, the flavor outstanding. I didn't dump the entire slurry of cornstarch/water, but kept adding until I was satisfied with the thickness, definitely did not use it all. I think that is just a preference type of thing.

Slightly different approach...I coated a baking sheet with 2T olive oil, then spread the chicken (straight from fridge) onto the sheet and baked at 400 degrees for 15 min.  Then turned the chicken and poured the hot sauce over the top, returned to oven for another 10-15 min.  Great reviews from family!!!  Also...only used 1/2 c sugar...will use another tsp chili paste next time to kick up the heat.  Yum!",

I used a whole can of chicken broth and mixed 1/3 C cold water and 3 T cornstarch to add to the sauce to thicken it.  I eliminated the sesame oil and sherry because we don't care for those flavors.  I served the sauce on the side. I made steamed broccoli, snow peas, and served it with Jasmine rice. Truly a restaurance quality recipe!  Thanks!",

Unfortunately, as soon as the sauce was poured over it, that great crispness was lost.  It made a nice presentation, but next time I'll serve the sauce on the side.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the sauce to 3/4 of a cup, and 2/3 cup would probably work too.  I only needed to use about 2/3 of the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  I fried the chicken in a wok and used peanut oil instead of olive oil and I only used about 1 1/2 cups of oil instead of a quart.  All-in-all this had a very good flavor and I'll make it again",
