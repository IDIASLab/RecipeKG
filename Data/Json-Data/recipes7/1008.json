I love curry and think that if I would make this again I would specifically pick up fish balls at an Asian market or just use chicken instead. The chunks of fish just fell apart and didn't taste like fish anymore plus the consistency of the fish in general was just strange. The curry itself was wonderful but I will use fresh veggies next. If you are in a hurry though the frozen mix is a great option.",

I sprinkled it with the seasonings broiled it whole for 10 minutes then broke it up and added it during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I used fresh veggies instead of frozen and sauteed them 5 minutes before using them in the recipe. And just for the heck of it I put some of the seasoning in the rice while cooking it to give it a bit of flavor. We will definitely be eating this again!
