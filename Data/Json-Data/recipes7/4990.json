Could not find grenadine anywhere so went with a Mountain Dew Code Red. You could also use Cheerwine or Big Red; works about the same.  I don't know about the grenadine, but the other options do not come up with an overly sweet drink.  As others have stated, use a good beer and plenty of ice.  Warning; you will NOT  taste the alcohol.  But two 8 ounce drinks later, standing up was interesting...Under NO circumstances should anyone attempt to drive after  drinking one of these; you simply won't anticipate the effect of the alcohol. It's a good tasting, easy to drink, strong as hell punch.....By the way, I didn't have a terrible hangover the next day.",
