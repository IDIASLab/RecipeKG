Broccoli slaw works well alone or with the coleslaw, chop up some celery for more crunch. Diced peppers, cucumber, radishes, etc. I think you get the point. Use whatever you like to eat. The other variable is the vinegar. There are many different flavors of vinegar. If you are like me, you will never eat the same salad twice.",
