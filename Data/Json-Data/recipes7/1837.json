I added 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg to help bring out the eggnog flavor (and because I love nutmeg). I ended up adding more eggnog to make the dough stick together. I made an eggnog-rum glaze to drizzle on top: I combined 1 1/2 Tbsp. melted butter, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring, 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 Tbsp. eggnog (add more or less eggnog to get the correct drizzling consistency). I then just put the glaze in a baggie, snipped off the corner and drizzled in a zig-zag pattern, letting the glaze run over the edges of the scones. Delish! Especially served warm with a nice cup of tea.",
