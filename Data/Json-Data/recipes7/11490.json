The crust turned out crumbly, and about half of it stayed in the dish when it was cut into squares.  When I patted it into the dish, it felt like it needed more butter, but I hate to change a recipe too much first time I make it.  There either needs to be more butter added to the gingersnap crumbs (and I weighed the crumbs, so I know the amount was correct), or the amount of crumbs needs to be reduced...or maybe both.  The crust-filling ratio seemed to be disproportionate to me.  Even my husband said you need more cheesecake filling on these.  So if I make these again, I\u2019d reduce the amount of crumbs, add more butter if necessary and, maybe, even add a little more cream cheese. On the positive side, they taste delicious, the lemon-gingersnap-cream cheese partner really well, and my 4-star rating is based on taste.  Thanks for sharing.",
