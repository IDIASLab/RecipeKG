I had an 8 oz package of the smoked salmon and just kept adding it in until I ended up using the entire package. I also use more onion - a bunch of scallions chopped - both whites and greens.  I couldn't find McCormick's so went with another brand of seasoning.   We ate it immediately because after the first taste we couldn't stop.  Of course, refrigerating and waiting to let the flavors come together made it even better the next day.   This is something I've made again and again! Since the first time I made this I've gone back to it and served it piped into fresh sugar snap pea pods - great contrast and crunch.  I've served it at dinner parties and for a large appetizer party I 'catered' and it was one of the first to go. The Best way to eat this is on green apple slices - wonderful flavor contrast! Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.",
