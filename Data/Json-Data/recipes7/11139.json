Doing this totally covered in the microwave does not give the \"alcohol\" a chance to cook off, and that's the only thing I disliked about this recipe.  It is very quick to make, delish, and if that alcohol taste bothers you a lot (and it may not), you always could just cook it off on top of the stove to get only the pure rum flavor, add the plantains, and then into the microwave to finish it off.  Also, I had enough butter-sugar syrup to cook another plantain, so you may want to keep that in mind if you need additional servings.  Do not overcook the plantains or they will turn to mush.",
