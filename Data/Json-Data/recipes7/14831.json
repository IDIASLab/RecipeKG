Definetly use unsalted butter in place of vegetable oil, however since I love butter, I did use melted butter and VEGE oil in bowl during first rise, instead of a non oiled bowl. I did a 2 hr first rise and a 1 hr 2nd rise. Don't skip the bread crumb part. I used AP flour, instead of bread flour, and rise was good, but next time I have extra bread flour, I'll use and see if changes texture or height because bread flour has more gluten in it.",

The dough is incredibly sticky so a mixer is preferable. The first time I rolled the dough in Italian bread crumbs. It gave them a more dinner roll flavor. The second time I used sugar and cinnamon. Both ways were delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and had my rolls rise twice (for 2 hours and 1 hour). I plan on experimenting with other flavors as well. Definitely a good recipe.",
