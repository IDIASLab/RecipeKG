I come from a long line of Italian cooks who are known for this dish. That said, I was happy to find a recipe that deviated from the usual way we make it. I am a basil fan so I did add extra basil. My Nonie insists that you must dip in flour first before the egg and bread crumbs. Since I have grown up with that step , I do it automatically now. Not sure if it even makes a difference!  Just when I thought I couldn't improve on the family recipe, I did! We make our own sauces and freeze for future use. I chose the caramelized onion and red bell pepper sauce which went great.  Next time I am making a double batch! Oh thank you for this jewel of a recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "Loosely followed this recipe. Up sized to make a 9\" x 13\" dish (1 large & 1 medium eggplant and 2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce). Tried the recipe s method of not flouring the eggplant before dipping in egg mixture/bread crumbs and the adhesion was not good... Nonie s method (Mom of five s review) of first dipping in flour is much better. Saut\u00e9ed onions and fresh garlic and then simmered with the marinara sauce to give it more flavor. Like others used regular mozzarella after being unable to find smoked mozzarella cheese given limited time. I m pretty sure this cheese is available at a local deli and will pickup some to make this again. I found this more involved and time consuming to make than anticipated... take note of the 20 minutes to 2 hours suggested for drying out the eggplant. I did 30 minutes after checking a few other recipes and that seemed fine. With more than an hour into cutting drying and frying the 2 eggplants the fried slices were placed in fridge for later use that afternoon. That is the major time factor and the dish comes together quickly after those steps are completed. This eggplant dish is very very good. In trying to make a healthier version while hopefully not sacrificing taste next time plan to follow the method of baking the eggplant detailed in Crunchy Eggplant Parmesan on this site and then finishing it off by using steps 3 5 and 6 of this recipe.

Kids loved it too which is surprising because they don't like much. The only thing I changed was that I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. This was only because I didn't have bread crumbs available. I served this with spaghetti squash and garlic bread. Will surely use again! Thanks for sharing.",
