If you do not \u201clove\u201d (and I do mean \u201clove\u201d) pickle juice, do not make this drink. 2. Use a good quality vodka. It is a martini mind you.  Bottom shelf/Plastic bottle vodka and pickle juice will hurt. I used Ciroc. Next time, I will use Grey Goose. I think that would be perfect. 3. If you are a light weight when it comes to vodka, decrease the ratio of pickle juice to vodka. Instead of 1 to 4, try 1 to 2. Otherwise, enjoy!",
