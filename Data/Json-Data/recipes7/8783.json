Made it a third time adding some raisins and absolutely loved the addition.  Also increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.",

I also used Granny Smith apples mainly because so many reviews said it was too sweet.  I sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar before baking.  After the suggested baking time, it was still soft in the middle so I turned off the oven and left it for about another 15 minutes.  It was fine after that.
