However I didn t see the point in salting the chicken and putting it on a rack and refrigerating it for 30 minutes. Am I missing something? I seasoned my chicken and lightly pounded it but not to 1/4 thick mine were closer to 1/2. I made the sauce as the recipe indicated with the exception of cutting the brown sugar to about 2-3 T. I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch just enough to give it some body and nice cling. And darn even though the Marsala wine was sitting right in front of my face I forgot to put it in. I ll remember it next time! Made as written I think it would have been excessively salty and way way too sweet. But with my minor changes this is a five star!",

I didn't have sherry so I used white wine and a gala apple figuring the sweeter apple would balance out substituting with the wine. It did, and was great!
