Suggestions - Don't skimp on the green onions shortly after adding green onions add 1-2T of lemon juice (this will add a little zest and freshness to the taste). As other reviewers have written... 1t. of salt is definitely enough. Lastly ginger burns easily so be careful because that can definitely make or break the dish.",
