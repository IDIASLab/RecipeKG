The pasta absorbed a lot of the liquid, I don't think I would cook it as long before putting everything together to bake the next time. I have never used mostaccioli before, and thought it was really pasty once the dish was done. This may have been because you put them in uncooked first. Otherwise a good dish!",

After 20 minutes the pasta was no where near ready for the final 10 minutes baking. I continued to bake for 15 minutes before adding the mozzarella and then baked for 15 more minutes. The finished product was very good and it serves a lot! Leftovers were very good warmed up the next day.",

Perhaps it was due to my reducing the ingredients to half but this turned out extremely dry for me and with not quite as much flavor as I was wanting and anticipating. Thanks for sharing this recipe matmyers!EDIT: I forgot to add that like another reviewer the pasta needed an additional 15 min. of bake time before adding the last layer of cheese and baking for the last 10 min. If I were to make this recipe again I think I will precook my noodles and then proceed with the recipe. Thanks!",
