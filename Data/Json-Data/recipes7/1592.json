It turned out fantastic. It made 3 medium size loaves for me and I only baked them for 30 min. at 350 F. ",

I freeze two of the loaves so it lasts longer. Take it out of the freezer the night before you intend to eat it and it's almost as good having it right out of the oven.

                "reviewBody": "As this recipe is written it is unworkable. First 4 cups of raisins is way too many raisins. Soaked or dry. I reduced to 2 cups of raisins soaked. One packet of yeast was insufficient to rise this dough. I added a second packet. Next 6 cups of flour is insufficient to knead the dough. I added an additional cup and a half of unbleached flour and used a bread hook with my mixer. The dough never balled up like a bread dough. It was elastic like a bread dough but was more batter than dough. I added the raisins to the flour and spices. Not into the milk mixture. Otherwise the raisins would rise to the top and not be dispersed through the entire loaf. I was determined to save this bread because it would have been costly to dump. The yield was three loaves. The bread was OK. By OK I mean edible but not anything special. I doubt that I will make it again. The rating for this recipe is misleading. This recipe would have been a total loss to a beginner. I don't like to trash people's recipes but I find it hard to believe that anyone could have successfully produced this recipe as written.",
