I didn't have any artichoke hearts so I left them out but I added some frozen corn for color. I also added black beans in addition to the chick peas. For presentation I garnished it with chopped cilantro and Mexican crumbling cheese. Delicious! I will definitely make this dish again!",

I didn't have the exact vegetables called for so I subbed zucchini for the yellow squash and red pepper for the green. I thought 4 cups was a lot so used about 2 1/2. This seemed to be the right amount. I also added some garlic. The only thing that seemed a little strange was the garbanzo beans. They weren't bad; just not really necessary. I served this over a pile of rice in soup bowls and everyone enjoyed it. Healthy and filling and leftovers for lunch. Planning to make it again!",
