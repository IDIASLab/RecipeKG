I am not a fan when a recipe says juice of a lemon or 1/2 a bunch of parsley because the amounts can vary depending on the size of your ingredients. My general rule of thumb is 3 tbsp. of lemon juice for an average sized lemon. 3 tbsp. was the perfect amount for my salad. My parsley bunch was very large and 1/2 bunch would have way overwhelmed the salad. I used about 1/4 of my bunch that equaled to about 1/2 cup chopped. I would start out lower on your parsley amount and adjust to your taste. Nice side dish that I would make again. It would also be great with some cherry tomatoes added in.",

                "reviewBody": "A Keeper! Intriguing flavors which evolve with sitting: 3 hrs after making it was very tasty & Very Lemony; after 24 hrs the lemon flavor had mellowed substantially yet was still nicely lemony (used fresh lemon & lemon zest, as called for). I substituted fresh basil for the parsley & the result was excellent; also used light agave syrup instead of sugar (easier to mix) which reduced the 'sweet' measurement in the recipe to 1 tsp with no diminution of flavor. We mixed green & yellow squashes which made a very attractive presentation. Well-refrigerated, the salad kept very nicely over 3 days. Altogether a lovely recipe with great potential for adding your own particular flavor flourishes!   [Cilantro (coriander leaf) might also be a nice change from parsley & we plan to try that next while we have it in the garden, as store-bought parsley & green zucchini will be our wintertime choices for this dish.]",
