The syrup is delicious you may want to add an extra T. of cornstarch if you are using frozen blueberries because of the excess water. Otherwise awesome and I will definitely make this a regular!",

Used just one 8oz package of cream cheese mixed with 1 tsp of vanilla. Put lots of little blobs of cream cheese all over (tedious!). Added a couple of shakes of cinnamon and more vanilla to the egg/milk mixture. I used Italian bread (because the French bread at the store seemed like it would end up mushy and the Italian was denser). I also failed to see the \"chill overnight\" when I read the recipe so I made it and popped straight in the oven! Used fresh blueberries. The syrup was FABULOUS! I'm going to make homemade syrup all the time from now on! (I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1-1/2) and it was plenty sweet.)",

I also doubled the maple syrup to sweeten it up and added about 1 t. of cinnamon. I only used about 8 eggs and that was plenty. I served mine with maple syrup and not the blueberry syrup.

(I baked the rolls day before Thanksgiving but for some reason they hardened up really fast. So these rolls were perfect for this recipe.) I did use reduced fat cream cheese fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk organic frozen blueberries that I thawed just a bit and Smuckers blueberry syrup (which I just happened to have in the fridge). My husband didn't care for it but it really was no issue because my kids snarfed up the rest. It was great for me because 1) breakfast was cake and 2) they were absolutely silent. Next time I may play around with the recipe and maybe use something besides maple syrup in the strata. It might be pretty too with a drizzling of vanilla icing over the top and make a nice almost bread pudding dessert.",

I made the strata following the directions but I used strawberries instead of blueberries (I had intended on using the blueberries but they were so expensive and strawberries were on sale). I know it is a major change but it was delicious!! Made it for Easter brunch and everyone loved it. They said it was so good they could not imagine it with blueberries. I will make it again and I will try the blueberries. Blueberries would be less work because you wouldn't have to do any cutting. I think this is a great recipe and easy to make. Also I did add a little bit of cinnamon to the milk/egg mix. Vanilla or little sugar to the mix would be good too. I love how you mix everything the night before then before you serve you make the syrup. Will make again.",
