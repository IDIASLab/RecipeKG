I used Keebler Vanilla Wafers since they were on sale, 1/3 less fat Philly, a little more vanilla than it calls for, and only 2 eggs because I accidentally looked at the other recipe I was mixing at the same time! I actually LOVED the consistency that it gave it though so I may just stick to doing that from now on!  The only thing I wasnt crazy about was the second layer on top. There was just too much! I think if you halved that amount it would be soo much better. Overall though it was a hit with our friends!  *Making this tomorrow (minus the top layer all together since I just realized I forgot Cool Whip!) and putting out a DIY topping bar. Crumbled Oreos/hot fudge and apple pie filling/caramel...Cant wait!*",
