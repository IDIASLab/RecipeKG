So I used 1/2 cup of Splenda in place of the sugar nonfat milk and one ripe mashed banana in place of the oil. I also used 3TB of white flour and covered the strawberries and blueberries in the flour before stirring into the batter so that they wouldn t be too mushy or sink to the bottom of the muffin pan when baking. When the batter was filled to full in each muffin portion it ended up making 14 muffins that rose up beautifully and were absolutely delicious! I baked the muffins for 19 minutes using paper liners. I wouldn t use paper liners again though. The muffins stuck to the paper. Next time I ll just put them in a Pam sprayed muffin pan and deal with the extra cleanup. By making these changes it also brought the calorie count from 164 per muffin to 87 calories per muffin with quite a bit less fat and sugar.",
