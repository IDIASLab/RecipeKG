It was too big for the IP, so we went to Plan B = I raided the freezer and pulled out five small venison backstraps, frozen solid and vacuum-sealed.  I threw them into a pan of cool water to defrost, and 15 minutes later, they were ready to cook.  Browned them, threw in the liquid, and started the IP.  Cooked them for 35 minutes, then added the veggies and cooked for 10 more minutes.  Needless to say, the roasts were done 90 minutes BEFORE the prime rib was done.  Did the IP save Christmas dinner? Yes!  Will I hold this over my husband's head forever?  Yes.  :)",
