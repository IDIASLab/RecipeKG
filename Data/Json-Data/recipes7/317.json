Beyond that though this was great - moist very orangey a nice colour. After the juice soaked in (15 mins or so) I topped the cake with store-bought chocolate icing. That was a good choice - the combination tasted like those chocolate oranges you get at Christmas. I made it for Halloween.",

I made it twice in one day! I had large home grown oranges which produced a lot of juice so I poured the juice from one right into the batter. I whisked a small amount of powdered sugar into the remaining orange juice before poking holes in the cake and spooning the juice over. Spoon a little at a time and you can tell when the cake is saturated. No mushiness at all. It tasted the best while still slightly warm but was fine the next day too.",

I served this with whipped cream and little clementine sections on top. It probably would also work with canned mandarin oranges. The juiciness of the oranges on top and the moisture of the whipped cream together with the flavorfulness of the cake made this a very good dessert.",
