I did increase the cocoa powder by 50%, used far less chocolate chips (a full cup was way too much for me, and next time I might use mini chocolate chips instead) and replaced both the oil and butter with unsweetened applesauce, and it turned out delicious and moist! Very satisfying for chocoholic health nuts like me. :) And a great way to sneak in a little extra veggie intake! I'm not sure why one reviewer squeezed the moisture out of his/her zucchini, because generally when you bake with zucchini the idea is that the vegetable provides some necessary moisture to the finished product so you DON'T want to press it...but I guess it depends on your moisture preference. I would recommend not squeezing your zucchini though, whether you're making this recipe or brownies or zucchini bread, but then again I love moist cakes/brownies/breads!",

As for the comments about this being a dense cake.... no kidding.  The water from the zucchini makes it extremely moist and ALL zucchini cakes will be like this.  This is not a light fluffy cake and will never be.  Take this into mind if you are expecting a sponge or light cake. Also, do not drain or squeeze out the zucchini.  This water is needed for moisture.  I've also added more than the recipe calls for (grated extra because of the size of the zucchini) and it doesn't hurt a thing.  This is delicious.",
