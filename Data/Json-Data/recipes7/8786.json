I also soaked the flaxseed in a few tablespoons of water for a few minutes before adding to the sugar mixture- this was my first time baking with flax and I read it can absorb the moisture out of whatever you are making unless you soak it first. I also only had 2 super ripe bananas but a good tip for yellow-but-not-yet-over-ripe bananas is to pop them in the oven (unpeeled) at 300 degrees for about 40 minutes. You may want to line your pan with foil bc they will release some juices. Let them cool then unpeel to find mushy sweet bananas - perfect for this recipe! I used 5 bananas and added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.",
