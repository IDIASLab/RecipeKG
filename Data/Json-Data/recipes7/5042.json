The kids loved it and so did my husband, and he doesnt usually like fruit breads. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I may do next time is add some nuts if i have them on hand, but the recipe is perfect without them.",

After reading the reviews, and respecting mis7up, as a fellow buzzer, I took her advice and added a little extra sugar.  I added an additional 1/4 cup, making my total 3/4 cup.  Butter (all I use) was used in place of margarine.  I decided to bake in 5 mini (6x3 1/2) loaf pans rather than a 13x9 pan. They rose beautifully and were done at the 35 minute mark.  I served this bread with 'Christmas Morning Egg Casserole' from AR.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoys them as bread, but our favorite way to eat them is toasted.  It seems to really make the flavors pop, and it did so with this recipe.  I would definitely make this recipe again.",

Hubby and son weren't much of a fan but 2 of my children were. Totally needs some tweaking. If plum/pluot fruit left out is a good banana bread on it's own however needs to be sweeter.",
