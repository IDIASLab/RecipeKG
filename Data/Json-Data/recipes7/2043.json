I eliminated the sugar - for me it was totally unnecessary and may have even been counterproductive. In keeping with the tropical flair of the recipe I substituted fresh lime juice for the vinegar (loved that!) and added some chopped fresh cilantro.  For my tastes, four stars as written and an unequivocal five stars with my modifications.  Served this alongside crab cakes and there couldn't have been a more ideal accompaniment.",
