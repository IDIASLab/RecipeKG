I substituted creamy peanut butter for the chunky and it turned out perfectly. I've received so many compliments and my picky family loves it! Ignore the other reviews that it is too soft. It sets up perfectly if you bring the milk and sugar to a soft ball stage (slighly golden in color) before adding the remaining ingredients.",

I cook my mixture in a thick walled heavy saucepan and once it comes to a boil I boil it exactly 5 minutes. No more no less. It turns out perfectly every time. I made about 10 batches of this for Christmas gifts so far and everyone who has tried it so far at my work love this fudge. I'll be making it for my son and his family when I visit them this month.",
