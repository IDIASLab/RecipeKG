If you don't have cake flour you can use 1 3/4 cups all-purpose mixed with 1/4 cup cornstarch. It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake and I covered it with foil the last 20 minutes because the top was getting too brown. The cake itself was a little dry but that's OK because you top it with the cream. I did not coat my strawberries in sugar because it's just needless calories - they're sweet enough! Now the cream is really not a whipped cream. The recipe doesn't say to but I beat mine for about 10 minutes in hopes it would thicken. With all the yogurt in there though it really didn't get thick like whipped cream. I think next time I would use 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and only 1/2 cup yogurt and make whipped cream. It doesn't say what flavor yogurt to use but I imagine anything would be fine. I used vanilla. Made as written the \"cream\" is quite runny and basically just yogurt. So for me it needs some tweeking but still a good recipe and easy to serve.",

As to complaints about it being dry this was not a problem here. Also liked the tangy topping which as recipe stated just stir together. Makes a very nice change from whipped cream. Much to prefer this cake type base for fruit than the popular biscuit type. Thanks for submitting...highly recommend if made exactly as written.",
