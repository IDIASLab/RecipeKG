I double the vanilla (only because I love vanilla)and use about 1 teaspoon maple syrup instead of sugar. I don't add the optional ingredients and enjoy the simple uncomplicated taste which reminds me of chilled oatmeal but with soft tiny crunchies. Sometimes I have a glob of chia seeds settle to the bottom which I have to stir well and break apart to create an even pudding-like consistency. If I use coconut milk I have better results and a much thicker pudding which too I love. Nice to have a recipe that isn't chocolate. Thanks nikkid!",
