The recipe didn't specify which kind of chips to use so I just went with what I had on hand which was semi-sweet. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla but I didn't want that to affect the cookie's outcome so I added one more teaspoon of flour just in case. I did chill the dough just about an hour just to firm up the dough slightly (and I put the dough in the fridge while the cookies were baking so the hot kitchen wouldn't soften the dough too much). This recipe made just enough cookies not too much not too little. The spiced dough worked really well with the chocolate chips I was pleasantly surprized as was my husband. We all loved them. Out of this whole recipe less than half remain. Winning recipe!",
