As the submitter suggests orange zest is 'to taste' so I used two tablespoons rather than the suggested three and found the essence to be very pleasant not too strong and not by any means too weak but the underlying flavor of the muffin is sorely lacking. The batter was extremely thin like pancake batter thin which had me worried but they baked up perfectly moist and rose just past the level of the tin (bear in mind I filled the cups 3/4 full and only filled ten cups rather than the full twelve. I'm glad I did as these wouldn't have been nearly as attracttive looking if I had divided the batter evenly as suggested). I chose dried cranberries over the raisins the sweet tang of which saved these muffins this time. I really enjoyed the texture the orange flavor and the pleasant oatiness of these muffins. Made again with salt I'm sure this recipe will become a keeper so thank you!",
