The other thing I did was use imitation rum flavoring instead of vanilla. All in all this is a great recipe and I know it will become a favorite holiday treat at my house (and my moms, I gave her the recipe and she cant wait to try it) ",

I also added 1/2 cup of hand chopped Maraschino cherries. VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure you squeeze as much juice out of the cherries with paper/cloth towel before adding them. It overpowers and you will no longer have eggnog fudge. You will have pink Mraschino cherry fudge.",
