They turned out absolutely beautiful, just like peanut butter cookies are supposed to look.

This cookie turned out perfect and it was a small enough batch that I didn't have to worry about the cookies \"wilting\" in the heat. My husband called me this morning and said that not only did they hold up well in Tupperware for his lunch but his co-workers liked them, too.",
