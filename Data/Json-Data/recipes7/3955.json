The sweetness of the traditional monkey bread is cut by the bananas and less sugar.  Use a bundt pan to cook it more evenly inside and out instead of a loaf pan.  This also spreads the sauce more evenly and melts the sugar.  The easy biscuit shortcut makes this a great brunch item or breakfast for a crowd on short notice.   Fantastic!",
