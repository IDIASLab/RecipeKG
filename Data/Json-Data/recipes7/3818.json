Delicious with a little bit of pepper for a kick. I will definitely make this again as it was very tasty and healthy. Even my boyfriend loved it and was asking me to make it again before we even finished eating the first batch! Wonderful sweet/spicy flavor with the added paprika and cumin. Thank you for this recipe!",

Once those are pureed it's only a matter of heating up the soup. My family thought it tasted \"fresh.\" However the recipe benefits from salt and pepper to taste plus garlic (which we added once we found it needed it).",
