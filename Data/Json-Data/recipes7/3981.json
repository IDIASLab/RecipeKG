It is comparable to Cold Stone Creamery's Cake Batter Ice Cream. I added 1 cup of yellow cake mix, which is just a little more than the recipe calls for. I realized after I began making this that the recipe required a ice cream maker, but have no fear, you can make this without one with success! Let your mixture cool in the freezer for 20 minutes and then pour into a large casserole dish or a cake pan. Freeze for 20-30 minute increments and take out in between and beat the ice cream with a hand mixer. I only had to freeze and beat the ice cream 4 times until it was done. I honestly think I will never buy ice cream again. This was easy and you could easily use a chocolate cake mix too. This is not runny at all as some other reviewers said, make sure you use the correct ingredients. For the milk, I used whole milk and make  sure you do not substitute the heavy cream for anything else. This is a CREAMY ice cream, not an icy ice cream. **Update** I have since purchased a Kitchen-Aid Ice Cream Attachment and I use that and it works great. I have used both white cake mix and yellow cake mix and the white cake mix tasted \"off\" so I highly suggest using yellow cake mix for a more authentic taste.",

I thought the cake batter taste wasn't too strong, you could maybe add a litte more, but I thought it was good as it.

                "reviewBody": "This was a nice base recipe inspiration but not all that wonderful on its own. I agree with the reviewer who said to use yellow cake mix and more of it -- that's a no-brainer. White cake mix has zero flavor and usually makes an awful tasting cake. I used a DH yellow cake mix. I used organic jumbo sized eggs which I think gave it too much of a custard-y egg-y taste so next time I'll cut back to two eggs or three regular large eggs (the recipe doesn't tell us what size eggs). This recipe has to increase the vanilla to get it anywhere in the ballpark of Cold Stone's cake batter ice cream. I think I probably used two or three TABLESPOONS before I decided it had sufficient vanilla taste. I also doubled the recipe and added two full cups of cake mix. Next time I might get a vanilla bean and scrape the insides into the batter for a stronger more authentic vanilla taste. Last I finely chopped two semi sweet chocolate bars and added them once the ice cream was getting to milkshake consistency. Without the chocolate this would not have been half as good. I will try this again with less egg and maybe more cake mix and more vanilla via fresh beans. This is a good recipe inspiration but needs some help to reach the right to be called even close to cold stone's or any commercial brand.",
