I followed the recipe for the filling as stated but found that when my pie baked it spilled out horribly every where in the baking pan I placed the pie on for spilling purposes. Even with 1 1/4 cup of sugar the pie filling was rather tart. Hubby didn't care for it...son and I agreed it was okay we are not big on tart fruit pies 2 of my 3 daughters said it was good with ice cream. Not sure if I will go all out and make again. Just because it was so so in my house. However if you are a real big fan of Rhubarb then it's probably for you.",
