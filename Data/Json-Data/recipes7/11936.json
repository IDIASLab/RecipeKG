I have never had a posole that didn't have some cumin chili.. etc.. and I really felt it needed that. I did like the butternut in this. I did not add the optional cream. After I jazzed this up with some spices I really did enjoy this. so do make this.. but have your spices ready",

I used leg and thigh meat, and pinto beans because I had them already.  I did not have any beer, so just used stock.  I also used a tomatillo salsa, personal preference.  I did not add the whipping cream, but I am sure that would have added another layer of flavor.  Great way to use up butternut squash!",
