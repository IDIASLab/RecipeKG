I got up early yesterday and tried it again. This time I used 3 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of TBS, thinking like another reviewer that it MUST be a typo. I also used a 9x12 deep pan. Although it took MUUUUUCH longer to bake...40 minutes or more... it turned out well this time - moist, flavourful and altogether delicious. Phew! I really dislike being defeated by a recipe so kudos to the cook! (That's ME!)",

I love cinnamon so I added a bit more to the streusel.  The bake time was much to low!  After even 20 minutes it was very wet with only about an inch border completely baked.  I added another 15 minutes and it baked perfectly.  As you can see from a previous reviewer, they halved the recipe and still baked it for 28 minutes.",

It has a nice light and moist texture, and the streusel topping was very good.  In the future, I'll use the suggested pecans on this coffee cake, and will chop them a bit more finely than I did the walnuts.  Shawnee McGee, thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Because of this I ended up baking it at 375 for a total of 45 minutes.  \nHOLY MOLEY! It tastes amazing! Would definitely do again and would recommend.",

I made a couple of changes, but the Baking powder was the most important. I think the author of the recipe meant Teaspoons not Tablespoons. In a half recipe I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and it was fine. In addition, after I put half of the batter into the 8 inch square greased baking pan, I dotted 1/4 cup of chunky applesauce all over the surface using a 1/4 tsp. measuring spoon and then I added the streusel. i proceeded with the rest of the recipe as directed, and I baked it for 40 minutes at 360 degrees F (my oven runs cold). IT came out great, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because if I had followed the directions as written, it would have been inedible with overwhelming flavor of baking powder.",

It's so good and reminds me a great deal of the one my mom used to make way back when we were kids. I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt and it's yummy! I made just 1/2 batch and used a 9X9\" pan and I didn't have any nuts to add and that's fine too. My mom rarely if ever added nuts to ours so it was another way to remember my childhood. I'm a fan of brown sugar so it's helping my sweet tooth for sure! Enjoy!",
