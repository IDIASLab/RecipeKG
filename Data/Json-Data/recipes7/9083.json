Also, if you mix your eggs, vanilla, milk and butter (didn't have oil) in a separate bowl until frothy it helps them come out light and fluffy. I have a photo of them on Instagram if you look up brainyheroine you'll be able to see them. :)",

I didn't have mini chocolate chips, so I chopped 1 cup of regular chocolate chips with a knife to make them smaller so they wouldn't sink. It worked great. I got 58 muffins, but I didn't fill the first batch up high enough. You can actually fill almost to the top. I've been paying $3 for twelve mini chocolate chip muffins at my grocery store's bakery. What a rip-off, and these taste better too. I won't be buying them from the bakery anymore. I'm REALLY glad I found this recipe today:)",

So I decided to try again and add/change some of the ingredients. Here's what I added...\n\nabout 1/2 tsp of cocoa power- added for flavor but mostly for color. The original muffins were so pale looking after they were finished baking.. This gives it a nice color without making them chocolate muffins. Add this to dry ingred. enough to tint it (not to change it to chocolate color/flavor)\n\nadded 1/2 tsp more vanilla extract \n\n1 tab extra of brown sugar\n\n1/8 tsp cinnamon- gives a hint of flavor but does not have a strong taste. I also added a little more choc chips because I'm a big fan of them!\n\nI've attached a pic of the muffins in photo section... Mine are in the blue rimmed bowl\n\nHope this helps! Happy Baking!!",
