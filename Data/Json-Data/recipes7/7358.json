I cooked down my peaches for an hour could have cooked them further but was anxious to be done. I added 2oz. real fruit pectin and turned off my heat. I put in your reccommended amount of spices but next time I am cutting the clove to one teaspoon. It is a strong spice and took over the flavour. It will be good on ice cream and yoghurt. I am going to try the less spice recipe again today. I bought a lug of peaches from my favourite farmer.",
