I didn't have broth on hand, so I threw 2 chicken bouillon cubes into a cup of hot water. I omitted the food coloring, and the salt. The bouillon cubes + soy sauce= enough sodium already! Also, instead of chives, I chopped up some green onion. Now if only I had some potstickers and fried rice...",

(recipe also from this site)  I don't know what it is, specifically, that makes this soup so good given its simplicity, but I can only guess it's the addition of the sesame oil, which I love. I prepared the recipe just as is, only mixing the cornstarch with part of the chicken broth rather than water and adding no salt or pepper.   I made two servings, one serving each for Hubs and me, and regret I didn't make more.  The consolation is that this is so quick and easy to prepare I could whip up more in no time!",
