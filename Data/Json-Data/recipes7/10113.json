This one is easy to communicate and even easier to remember, since all of the measurements are in multiples of 3, which explains some of the more arcane measurements! A triple recipe, of course. I use this recipe both to serve with soup or chili, as well as the foundation for Nana's cornbread turkey stuffing. Enjoy!",

I did leave out 1/4 cup oil and added 1/4 cup honey for a slightly sweeter cornbread. I also made a thinner batch in my cast iron pan and a thicker one (which came out more cake-like) in a dark pan.Both were great. It does make a lot, but it'll last a few days and I would rather have too much of this deliciousness than not enough.",
