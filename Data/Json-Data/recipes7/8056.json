I also have never poached salmon so I just cooked it in the oven at 375 F with lemon juice and a few dabs of butter. I used a little more than half of the oil called for in the dressing and I didn't have a lemon to zest. I also use double the amount of mustard called for as the recipe says use your own personal taste and I'm sure different mustards will affect the flavor. It turned out great a nice simple light salad for lunch or supper.",

One of my arugula plants was about to flower, so I needed a recipe for arugula and this was perfect. I also added some spinach because I needed to use it up. I ended up grilling the salmon because I like that flavor and I did add some strawberries to give it some color and a little sweetness. I did cut back on the olive oil (used 2 tablespoons instead of 4) because I don't like a lot of oil in my dressing. Fantastic! Will make again!",
