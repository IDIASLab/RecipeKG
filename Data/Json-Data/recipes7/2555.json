Instead of red pepper flakes I used 1 Tbl of Mongolian Fire Oil, which added a hint of fire but nothing you need a drink close by for. I also cooked half a white onion, half a red onion, 1/2 a cup of left over red bell pepper and some julienned carrots. Cooked the Onions and Peppers separately in a Tbl. Sesame oil and a Tbl. of Mongolian Fire oil (found in the Asian section of your local grocery) and a Tsp of minced garlic. I used sirloin instead cutting into thin strips. Mixed the Veggies back in at the end and then served it over Oven Brown Rice (found on this side). I have an excellent local Mongolian restaurant we love, sad to say I can now make it better, cheaper, and faster at home.  This dish is defiantly going into the dinner rotation!",

I wanted to try it as written and I regret it now (and I'm certainly not afraid of salt). Regarding the sauce I suppose you could double the marinade but I think it would be really REALLY salty. Use low sodium soy sauce as other suggested and this would be a 5 star. I used flank steak / marinated for a day. VERY good. Thanks for the recipe.",

I always add one tablespoon of peanut sauce (different from peanut oil) to the marinade.  Because flank steak has gotten so expensive by me, I usually use fajita meat, but the last time I cooked it I sprung for the flank steak, and it was worth the extra cost.  I usually make it with a side of white rice and teriyaki vegetables and mix it all together.  Great submission!",
