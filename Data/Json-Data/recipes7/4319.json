Placed all veggies together in ziplock bag in fridge. 3) Mixed sauce night before and added red pepper flakes to add spice.  I browned the beef with the ginger that I marinated with.

I actually cut up all the vegetables and sliced the meat earlier in the day because I was going to be busy in the evening. Half the meat and vegetables had to be cooked at a time as suggested which made it a little messy and dirtied more dishes than necessary. The end result strangely reminded me a little bit of the flavor of chop suey. I definitely will try buying the sirloin as suggested. I thought it was way more tender than round steak. I also don't ever use bok choy so that was an interesting addition I had not thought of. Overall it was just too much time in the kitchen for my normal quick stir fry recipes but it surprisingly was much better than what I would expect from a healthier beef dish.",
