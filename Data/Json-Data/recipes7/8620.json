I followed the recipe pretty close but I didn't have 14 cloves of garlic so I used what I had which was about 10. I melted the margine in a saucepan over the stove with the garlic then I added the lemon juice. Next time I would omit the second amount of salt I don't think it needs it as it is very flavourful with just the garlic. You don't need 1/4 cup of olive oil I used just enough to coat each breast. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.",

This made a nice full 13x9 inch pan dinner and my son and husband loved it. My husband ate two big pieces of chicken and has dished up the leftovers for work tomorrow but he couldn't stop picking at the leftovers as he was dishing it up. He deemed this as possibly his new favorite meal so thank you very much for posting this recipe. I will be adding this to our monthly menu for sure. I didn't think any of the flavors were too overpowering but we are all big cheese and garlic lovers so I can see where someone who wasn't so keen on the Parmesan and garlic flavors would probably want to cut back.",
