I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and for the 1/2 cup of butter is used 3 tablespoons of butter and 4 tablespoons of vanilla yogurt. I sprinkled the top of the unbaked muffins with a little brown sugar and oats.  I did not add nuts just because by girls don't care for them.  With my changes the muffins were around 150 calories per muffin.",

My husband who says he doesn't especially like muffins loved these and so did all the guys at his work. I was going to add apple pie spice as suggested by someone but I forgot. I will make these again and will probably add the spice and throw in some more cranberries--I loved the tart flavor they added. The topping made too much for me for the 12 muffins so I froze the rest to use later. The only issue I had was that the batter was super thick almost like cookie dough. I couldn't \"fold\" the zucchini mixture into it. I was glad I hadn't pressed any of the water out of my zucchini. I had to use the hand mixer to incorporate it all in the batter. I was a little concerned with how thick the batter still was but they turned out beautiful moist and delicious! Update- these froze very well!",
