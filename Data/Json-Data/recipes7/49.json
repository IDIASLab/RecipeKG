I was muching on the leaves - so tender and wonderful flavor, you can use practically every bit, stems and all.  The dressing was delicious.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and half a bunch of green onions, as mine were huge.  I would recommend either doubling the salad or halving the dressing, as it made a lot of dressing.  Also, better eaten right away because the noodles get soggy by the next day (maybe sprinkle them on top and don't mix them in?).  Thanks so much for sharing!\r\n\r\n",

Update:  I make this often but I use romaine lettuce which we've decided we like better than bok choy.  Sometimes I add canned mandarin orange slices which makes this salad even YUMMIER!
