I tasted a lavender bud and thought it was quite strong so I heated the milk and steeped the lavender in the milk overnight then discarded the buds. This gave the milk a nice light lavender taste and no crunchy buds. I added a cup of chopped pecans for texture which came out really good. One of my \"guinea pigs\" loved the bread and so did I It came out just a tad tangy and completely delicious. I also made one 9\"x 5\" and three mini loaves for sharing. Next time I make it I might just go hog wild and leave the buds in. Thanks!",

I only used 2 teaspoons of lavender (crushed in a mortar and pestle) rather than 2 tablespoons, and the flavour was great - I'm not sure if I would use much more lavender than that. Maybe crushing the flowers released the flavour a little?",

After some research while the bread was in the oven I discovered fresh lavender is much less potent comparecd to the dry stuff. In conclusion my bread had a very very faint lavender taste next time I will dry my stocks or use more fresh stuff!:) Thanks for the recipe!",
