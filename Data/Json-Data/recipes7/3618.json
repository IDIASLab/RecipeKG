I also used egg substitute instead of whole eggs. The color wasn't that great so I added three drops of yellow food coloring. I did not really like the bigger pieces of lavender in the lemon base. In fact, mine kind of migrated toward the middle instead of being evenly distributed throughout the egg mixture. So I would suggest grinding them up with a mortar and pestle or a small food processor. I also added the zest of a lemon. Wasn't sure how the kids would like this, but they did. They are used to eating lavender though. ",
