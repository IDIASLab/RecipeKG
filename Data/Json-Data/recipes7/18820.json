I ran out of AP flour so I used 3/4 C AP and 1T coconut flour. With the coconut flour I should have used an extra egg but I only brought 3 to room temp so I added 2T of milk. No Nutella so I mixed shaved dark choc with peanut butter melted in Microwave. I also added 1/4 tsp salt to batter and a dash to swirl. I found the 4 oz vanilla yogurt cup I used was not quite 1/2 c liquid measure so I added 1T from another container. In the end my center/bottom of loaf was dense like it had fallen. I probably overmixed the batter after adding the flour and maybe a 4th egg vs milk would have worked better with the coconut flour. The corners of the loaf with no choc swirl had a good texture and a tangy good taste so I think it would have been great if I had truly followed the recipe.",
