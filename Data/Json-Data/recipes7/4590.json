Didn't have any heavy cream so I substitued the cream and water for 2% milk and had to cook it for about 1hr 45min before all the liquid was absorbed. I added raisins and apples and it was DELICIOUS.  The second time I made it I only put in half the sugar and you couldn't tell.  Will absolutely make again!",

I don't understand how you can keep cooking rice with no liquid after adding the raisins. Anyway after adding the raisins I cooked another 5 minutes. Maybe I should have done the full 10. I add the egg yolk mixture but after cooking and stirring it started to separate. I think the reason was because I still had liquid in my pan. I added some more milk to help the separating problem. This recipe was a little sweet/rich for me but still good.",
