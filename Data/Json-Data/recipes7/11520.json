I can't believe it but I totally forgot the vinegar in this lol but it was wonderful w/o it and stayed more on thick side rather than liquid-y which we loved.

I also really don't care for a lot of dressing so I used 1 medium cucumber and halved the dressing. I used a garden cucumber and peeled and de-seeded it. I cut the onion and cucumber between 1/8 1/4 inch slices as it really didnt say. I used non fat yogurt reduced fat sour cream but regular mayo which was what I had. Made as written here I got 3 servings at approximately 78 calories each. Overall it was a little more vinegary or tart than I like. For the lime juice I used 1 1/2 tsp. when I halved it. I might test a little less white vinegar though next time. However I liked the dill flavor and that the dressing was not real thick. I would still make this again. Note: Second time making and still halving the dressing I only did 1 Tblsp of white vinegar instead of 2 and that worked perfect. May even add another half a cucumber due to extra dressing.",
