The only other change I made was baking these in a muffin pan rather than cake tin. Flavor was great and definitely will try these with other fruit as well. If you are going to do these in a muffin tin make sure you cut your baking time nearly in half. Also use muffin papers in order to help with clean up later. This recipe gave me 12 good sized muffins.",
