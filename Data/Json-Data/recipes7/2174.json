I only used 1.5 tbsp which was plenty. Also, the coconut milk should be a full-fat (not low fat) and also varies quite a bit by brand. I prefer the Chaokoh brand which is nice & thick. Both of these brands should be available at any decent Asian market. A couple of changes I made: 1. used boneless chicken thighs (not as dry as breast meat), 2. reduced sugar to 1 tsp. I also added carrots, onions, and peas (gotta sneak those vegies ;) This one's a keeper. ",

If coconut milk is too strong for you, reduce the amount or add some chicken stock.\n\nAll you need is to stir-fry your favorite vegetables in sequence depending on the cooking time. In my case, onions and carrots first, followed by fried tofu curds. Then I add some curry paste and coconut milk before adding tomatoes, green beans, and broccoli stems. Add the remaining of curry paste and coconut milk and let the sauce simmer until green beans are cooked to your liking. At the end, add zucchinis and broccoli florets a few minutes before you put the lid on and turn the heat off. \n\nMeat is almost unnecessary in this dish. If you like chicken, cut it in thin slices and marinate in some cooking oil and green curry paste. To ensure that chicken is tender and cooked thoroughly, stir-fry chicken as soon as vegetables are done. In a separated pan that is big enough for all ingredients, add some oil before adding chicken. Constantly stir chicken until only some pinkness shows. Add steamy-hot cooked vegetables in and mix all ingredients well.\n\nVegetables recommended for green curry: asparagus, bamboo shoot, bean sprout, broccoli, butternut squash, carrot, green bean, eggplant, mushroom, onion, snow pea, sweet pepper, tofu, tomato, zucchini, and etc.",

Use boneless chicken thighs instead of breast.  All this really intensifies the flavours!!",

I think it heavily depends on the curry paste you have, b/c they vary significantly by flavor and heat.  My green curry paste was not very hot, but was flavorful, so even though I increased the amount of curry paste, the dish was missing heat for me.  Next time I'll add Thai chili peppers with this particular curry paste.  I added lemongrass (cut into large pieces so you can easily remove them before eating), Thai basil (totally essential!!), carrots, and red pepper.  I also tried making coconut rice by putting coconut milk into the rice cooker.  It was mildly fragrant with coconut, so I might tweak with that more.  With the added ingredients I think the curry had a lot more dimension, texture, and flavor, but needed more spicy/heat boost to compare to the Thai curries I had in Thailand!  Will add more curry paste and chili pepper next time... or try a different brand of curry paste.",
