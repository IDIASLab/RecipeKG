I have an almost similar recipe I found on Pinterest using whole milk regular sugar and non-fat dry milk powder. I actually like this one better made lighter and with the peanut butter. I did make a few small changes. I halved the recipe and got 1 large serving. I do not care for whey protein powder in any flavor so I subbed vanilla slim fast powder. It is a little sweeter. I added the optional Stevia and didn't bother with the 1 Tblsp of heavy cream because I didn't have it. That small amount in any smoothie or drink is barely detectable anyhow from my experience.",

I'm thankful to have come across this recipe for a low-carb smoothie that tastes great and my family enjoys as much as I do!",

Because I didnt want to throw it out I added another stevia packet and that helped a little so I added one more (4 total) and added more vanilla extract (1 tsp) total and that was better.
