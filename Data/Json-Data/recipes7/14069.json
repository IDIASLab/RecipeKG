There are many types of crabs so I'm not sure which kind you are supposed to use here. Blue crab maybe? I don't know? I used the kind available to me and they did not disappoint. The sauce is excellent and I think it would be good with shrimp too. There was just the right amount of sweet heat and tart and then you go adding cilantro and MMMMMMM! Messy yes but 5 stars all the way! Thanks for sharing!",
