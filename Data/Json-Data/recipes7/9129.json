I bought 2 packs of Pillsbury Simply Oatmeal Brown sugar cookies and added above amounts of flaxseed, wheat germ, and Solgar brewer's yeast.  I let cookie dough soften and just mixed other ingredients in with a fork.  Turned out delicious!  Ate 3 cookies and followed with a half liter of water and I was engorged a few hours later.  This recipe is a keeper!  I thought I would post my shortcut for anyone who is in my same position though it does not wholly speak to the from scratch recipe.",

The flax should be geletin like after soaking in the water. The taste was good, I got my brewers yeast at a vitamin store. After trying my first batch I added1T cinnamon to the dough and each batch I added something a lil different . I used: chopped apples, fresh blueberrys, walnuts and crasins. I froze half the plain dough so I could make more later. I had my cookies at about 9pm with a cup of mother tea and went to bed with flat boobies by 7am when I woke up they were round and over full. My 6 month willow was delighted and made such happy sounds while nursing. So happy the first thing I tried worked for me! Also milled flax seed is what I used , I think its the same as flax seed meal just labled differently. And the brewers yeast doesn't say debittered but since I bought it at a vitamin shop, and its made for adding to food, I suspect it is debittered reading some of the other reviews. If your having milk troubles TRY this!",
