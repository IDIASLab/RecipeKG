The only reason I give it four stars is because I made one major change and that is I used whipping cream instead of milk. This made the mixture come out nice and extra creamy before I even put it into the ice cream maker. I followed the recipe directions exactly as is otherwise. At first I thought the ice cream wasn't coming together (like other reviewers stated) but it came together pretty well like a soft serve. After sitting in the freezer for a couple hours it hardened nicely. Just the way I like my ice cream solid and creamy.",
