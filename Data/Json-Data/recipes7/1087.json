I thought 1 cup of mayo was a bit much, so I used a mix of 1/4 cup of Hellman's lite mayo, 1/4 cup of lite Miracle whip, and 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the buttermilk. I like a sweeter coleslaw of I upped the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added 3/4 tsp. seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp. ground mustard, 1/4 tsp. celery salt vs. using celery seed plus the additional black pepper. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours and it was delicious!",
