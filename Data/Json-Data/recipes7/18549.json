I sub the white sugar for confectionares sugar at same quantity and came out perfect. I didn t have molds to make flower cookies so I made them little balls at first. Soon I discovered that cream cheese doesn t expand and the cookies stayed balls. So next batch I flattened out the balls and looked like cookies. I did this recipe as prescribed and made 1 balls and got about 5 dozen. I added green food coloring too since I am giving them for Christmas. I planned to add sprinkles at the end but dough too hard or well baked to allow for sprinkles. Cookies taste like an actual lemon cheesecake! Nom-nom-nom-nom?? delicious!!!!",
