I made it once before and had quite a bit to work with, so this time I was ready!  I eliminated the added salt, reduced the amt of baking soda by half and sugar to less than 1/2 cup  (way too much especially if using confectioner's sugar at the end) and used only 1 1/4 cups of flour.  I also added a touch of banana extract.  They were delicious mini beignets.  A great treat for either brunch or snack.",

I had 2 bowls - one for all the dry ingredients ( used only 2 tbsp caster sugar instead of white) and added a pinch of cardomom powder too. The other bowl had the smashed bananas and vanilla (this is great to use up any bananas you have in the freezer too!). Combine both and using an oiled spoon (helps not to stick), drop them into the oil to fry. Loved by even my toddler!",
