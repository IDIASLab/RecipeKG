After that, I always have wanted to make it  by myself.\nToday my dream of baking Khachapuri came true, I could make it by myself with the recipe of Chef John. Fantastic taste!  It is really delicious. \n\nI strongly recommend it to every body.\nI have nothing to talk about this recipe...... except I added some shredded cheddar cheese.  I also ate this bread with some fresh tomatoes and Arugula, This fresh vegetables increase the greatest taste matching with Khachapuri. \nThanks John.",

I made only one change - my khachapuris turned out very rectangular (long, straight sides) unlike Chef John's, which were more oval and pointy (he described it as \"canoe-like). So, I cracked two eggs in each - had the room and it looked \"balanced\" - the back of an ice cream scoop is just the implement to create the wells for the eggs. I also did make an egg wash - gave the dough a nice appearance and a little crunch. Next time, I'm going to reduce the feta (maybe by half) and increase the proportion of the other cheeses. As much as I like feta and all things salty; this was a little salty for me.",
