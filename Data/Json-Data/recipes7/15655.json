I got to the part where you add the cinnamon chips and discovered to my dismay that what I thought were cinnamon chips were instead white chocolate chips and I had to go with those. I followed the recipe letting them sit in the fridge for several hours before baking them. My first tray burned like crazy into flat puddles with a big bump (the Oreos) on top. I turned the heat down to 350 and got a better second tray. I do think that the double-stuffed cookies were just too much and would recommend just regular cookies. I will try these again using cinnamon chips since I realize that those chips would make a huge difference! Thanks for an interesting cookie!",
