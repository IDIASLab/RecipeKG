I was surprised though at the mayonaise base. For some reason I was thinking it would be lighter and it also had a strong mustard taste. I did use stone ground mustard for the dijon so that may be the reason. I would only use dijon next time and 1 Tblsp. at most. I might also cut the onions back by half or more for personal preference as I thought the onion was a little strong. The only main change I really made was using lite mayo and sour cream which I do in most every recipe. And I left out the black pepper which I also do in every recipe because I don't like it. This is a very filling salad and would work fine as a main dish with the ham in it. I got at most 4 decent sized servings instead of the six. So I would double if I made it again. The orzo is cooked perfect in the recipe and the salad seems adaptable to slight changes like a macaroni salad which I liked. With a few changes in the amount of onion mustard and black pepper it is a really good way to use up some leftover Easter ham. Thank you.",

I'm going to let it sit for a while and then serve tonight on a bed of lettuce. Will come back and re-rate then. UPDATE: Texture and taste does change after letting it sit.
