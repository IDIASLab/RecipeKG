I also added the zest from the Lemon but I ALWAYS add more lemon to ANY Lemon recipe because \"LEMON\" is my favorite flavor. Ever since I was a child I can peel them & eat them like Oranges. No such thing as too lemony for me. After everyone has stopped puckering I would admit that I don't recommend this \"Lemon-Juicing\" for everyone.",
