My only other comment has to do with the directions. My Mississippi mama who taught me to make biscuits always said \"the less you handle the dough, the better your biscuits will be. And NEVER knead no matter what the recipe says.\" I've always followed that hint, use White Lily flour, and make biscuits that my family devours. We loved this shortcake -- thank you so much for sharing!",

Was making a dessert for a diabetic friend and substituted 1 tblsp of Stevia for sugar in cake mix and 1/4 cup of stevia for strawberries (otherwise too sweet).  Used (I pretty much always use honey for my whipped cream) Tupelo Honey (safe for people watching their sugar) and placed cakes in ramekins for easy transport.  This is an awesome shortcake recipe (despite the substitutions), I'll try it using sugar next time and I know it will be even better!  Thanks Divinity!\n\n4 hrs later - neighbors LOVED this dessert...we were already stuffed after a delicious steak dinner YET they devoured it!  (I was smiling!)",
