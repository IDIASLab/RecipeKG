I followed some suggestions in other reviews by using 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla and used about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I also used a good honey whole wheat bread and sprinkled the top with the pecans and some cinnamon/sugar. Served with powdered sugar on top. This will definately be made again, and again, and again!!",

This was excellent!  It's a great change from the standard breakfast casserole.  The spices were great and it wasn't overly sweet.  45 minutes was just the right time to bake it.  I can't wait to make this again and I'm sure it'll become a standard during the holidays.  Thanks!!",
