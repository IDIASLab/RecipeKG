To make it more diabetic friendly, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and reduced the amount to just half the original amount.  I didn't have any green peppers on hand, so substituted thinly sliced green onions.  And I substituted grated cheddar cheese for the processed cheese.  \n\nIt was a very interesting way to serve corn, very much like a crustless quiche.   And as one counting carbs, since it stretched the high-carb corn with lower-carb ingredients,  I could have a larger serving.  I even ate some of the leftovers reheated for breakfast.\n\nI'll definitely be making this again and will likely use green peppers next time or perhaps a combination of green peppers and onions.  I do think that the recipe needed less salt for our taste.",
