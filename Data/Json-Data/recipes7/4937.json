I used closer to a sprinkling of nutmeg than a pinch. possibly as much as a 1/4 tsp. I used 2 boxes of store bought pie crust (4 rounds of dough) and did not roll them out. I used the lid to a Nancy's Yogurt container (5.5 inches in diameter) and was able to fit 4 rounds in each pie crust for a total of 16 empanadas. I had a TON of stuffing left over so I used the pie scraps and fashioned two mini-pies using pie tins made for a toaster oven. I think I liked the mini-pies better than the empanadas because the crust-to-stuffing ratio was better; they weren't as pretty though. Alternately I bet homemade crust cut into 6 to 7 inch empanadas rounds would have a good ratio. Overall a very tasty recipe. It was my first time working with kolrabi. I will definitely cook this recipe again! Update: did cook this again and completely skipped the empanada and went with pies. Used a muffin tin and they came out ADORABLE! See photos:)",

I put mine in the freezer for 20 min because I tried to go right from the pan to the crust and the crust fell apart immediately. And I cooked the veggies for a little longer so they were softer. Home-made pie crust would be lots better I think! This is a good starting point recipe.",
