Good as-is, but of course each person can salt and pepper their own serving to taste. The leftovers are good served as a cold salad if you don't like the cooked spinach that results from re-heating. Almonds and walnuts can be used in addition to or instead of the pecans.",

No dressing needed at all. \nTip#1: To make peeling/cutting the butternut squash easier, poke holes in surface of the squash with a fork a few times, then microwave for 3 to 4 minutes.   Let cool.  Peel, cut and roast as directed. \nTip#2: Can be made ahead - Roasted the butternut squash and onions the night before, then refrigerated.  Just before serving the next day, I microwaved the squash/onions for a few minutes and mixed them with the spinach/nuts/cranberries.  Tasted good the following day too!",
