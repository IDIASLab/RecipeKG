                "reviewBody": "I halved this recipe and came up with 19 meatballs making sure to have no leftover parts. I used 2 Italian sausages and 1 pound of hamburger using a small cookie scoop for the sausage (and that cut in half) and a larger scoop for the hamburger. It was a little difficult to get the sausage meat to stick together but they held up well with the boiling method. For the sauce I used only one 28 ounce can of San Marzano tomatoes with basil otherwise following the recipe. This all turned out well and we (hubby and I) enjoyed the dinner as did my son's family who received all the leftovers. I don't think that if I were to make these again that I would bother with making the little meatball in the middle because in the end you couldn't tell the difference between the two----it would have been fine just to mix all those ingredients together. Maybe it would be fun if there were a different color to one or the other after cooking. We did have a nice dinner so thank you lynn socko!",
