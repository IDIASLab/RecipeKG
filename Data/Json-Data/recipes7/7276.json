The strawberries gave the rhubarb enough natural sugar so I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup.I also cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup in the topping. This made it a low sugar dessert and more healthy. It turned out delicious. The almond extract gave it a really nice nutty taste. Great way to use up the rhubarb in the garden. I'm thinking of freezing some rhubarb so I can make this healthy version through out the year.",
