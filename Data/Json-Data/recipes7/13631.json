                "reviewBody": "Yes, this recipe does work and tastes delicious when done correctly. No, it's not as easy as it sounds (as you can tell by the negative comments, here). So, why bother with this recipe? Well, learning to make this sauce helped me master all sorts of recipes that required caramelized sugar. With that being said, first, you need a little less water than a 1/2 cup: just enough to moisten the sugar. That's because all of that water has to evaporate before the hot sugar will caramelize (because the temperature of caramelization is 320-340F, which is higher than boiling - 212F). Second, and this is important, when the sugar starts to boil, drops will splash along the sides of the pot, the water will evaporate, and the sugar will crystallize there. If they fall back into the pot, they act as seed crystals, which can make the entire mixture harden (which has happened to some people who've tried this). For that reason, try not to splash the sugar mixture on the side of the pot when initially combining the water and sugar. To remedy this, dip a pastry brush in a cup of water and gently brush the sides of the pot to dissolve the sugary drops until they run back down into the pot.  You will only need to repeat that until the bubbles get larger and stop splashing. After that, it should be smooth sailing. Now, be patient while it is being heated and DON'T STIR the mixture (mixing will cause crystals to form); the sugar WILL caramelize, and turn the beautiful amber color you want; but will ",

                "reviewBody": "These proportions of sugar, cream and butter make a delicious caramel, rather you add all the salt or not.  I just added a heaping 1/4 tsp., as I needed regular caramel.\n\nI had never made caramel before and I let it get too dark so it tasted way too bitter to salvage.  Take two.  I brought the sugar to the boil on high heat, then turned it down to medium high and watched it like a hawk.  Once it starts to color at all,  turn it down to medium. If you have an electric stove you may need to slide the pan off heat since it takes a sec for the temp to drop.   Swirl the sugar gently without lifting the pan, to even out the color.  I took mine off the heat at the light golden color because it continues to cook and darken while adding the cream and butter.  That's how I burnt my first batch.\n\nI also warmed my cream in the microwave, and had my butter room temp.  This way it doesn't seize and clump and is much easier to whisk smooth.\n\nDon't be discouraged if your first effort bombs.  You'll see how much heat you can work with, how quickly the sugar colors before it burns.  If it gets too dark don't think the cream will save it!  If it smells burnt it is burnt.  Throw that sugar out and start again.  You'll get the hang of it and never want to buy caramel again.",
