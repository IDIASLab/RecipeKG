I had way too much filling for just the middle of the cake so I cut a shallow cone out of the top of the cake and placed the rest of the filling in the cone. I topped it with the cake piece I cut out. The filling runs considerably even after refrigerating it. My cake circle and the bottom layer of the cake were covered in the filling. Thankfully the ganache does cover the filling that runs. I placed toasted coconut on the sides to hide imperfections from the filling flood.",
