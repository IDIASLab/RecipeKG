I had a loaf of homemade Cinnamon Raisin Bread that my neighbor gave me, and went a bit unnoticed in the back of the fridge for a few days. It was a bit dry, so I searched what recipe I could use it in. Saigon Cinnamon, milk from Switzerland, Vanilla from Guatemala, and good bread made in the USA. Organic eggs and Rapadura sugar- it almost makes me feel like I just made them an incredibly clean, healthy meal, that smells like the best dessert ever! My entire house smells delectable, and I am positive this will be a huge hit with the kids. If it makes it until dinner time...",
