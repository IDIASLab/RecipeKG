I also began giving these out as Christmas food gifts. This was requested by my 17-year-old son for our dessert we have to bring to his football banquet. My 21-year-old daughter who moved to Ogden, Utah with her husband and 2 kids wants to make these muffins for her in-laws who will be spending the Thanksgiving holidays with them.",

Right before baking, I sprinkled each muffin mound with a little sugar. Baked at 350*, these were done at a little over 20 minutes. We all thought this muffin was fantastic, especially me.

I only used one egg (I was short) and reserved a Tbsp of sugar for the cranberries. Instead of cutting each cranberry, I cooked them with the reserved sugar and a Tbsp of water until they burst, then folded them into the batter. The added syrup (from the juices, sugar and water) sufficiently loosened up the batter to muffin consistency. They were pretty delicious if I do say so myself. As an added bonus, the cranberries folded into the pumpkin batter have a really nice Autumn swirl effect. I'll make these again and again!",
