Moist and lemony and exquisitely delicious.  I used a combination of lemons and limes to use what I had on hand and Limoncello for the Grand Marnier (Triple Sec would have been a fine substitute too!)  I did add the ginger as directed, but quite honestly neither Hubs nor I could detect it.  As for the syrupy drizzle, I boiled the lemon juice/ sugar mixture for a couple of minutes to make sure the sugar was dissolved. Man oh man, that cake soaked that right up! (I brushed it over the cake, little by little, with a pastry brush) No wonder it was so good and sweet  and sinfully moist and lemony!  But I didn't stop there.  The cake looked half-dressed, and looked like it could use some accessorizing.  So I made a powdered sugar glaze with about a cup of powdered sugar and enough lemon juice and milk to make it about the consistency of thick Elmer's Glue, and then gave it a few shavings of fresh grated lemon zest. I swear that took it right over the top.  Hubs and I had a little taste of the cake and I was proud to give the rest away to some friends in Naples.  We were told it completely disappeared in a matter of a few minutes. I promised those who weren't lucky enough to get any I'd be back with more.",

I like a super strong lemon flavor so I added a half cup of lemon juice straight to the batter and to make it extra moist a package of lemon pudding/pie filling. I omitted the alcohol and I don't think it tasted like it was lacking anything. I would like to make it again using blueberries and a cream cheese icing I think that would be great! For this amount of batter I used it to make two 8x4 loaves for 50 minutes.",

I just furthur cubed the large frozen mango cubes that I had partially thawed (hard frozen mango is impossible to chop). I used ammaretto instead of orange liqueur and used sour cream thinned out with milk for the buttermilk I didn't have. The lemon glaze on top adds alot of sparkle to the loaves.

Very versitale I had to make changes since I didn't have all the ingredients. Didn't have orange liquer so I used lemon juice instead. Used ground ginger and added it to the wet ingredients. I reduced the lemon juice in the icing and added milk. Powder sugar was probably what was intended when listed as \"white\" sugar. Excellent cake! Light ginger taste goes very well will the zesty lemon.",

I was aiming for maximum lemon flavor without using the glaze so in place of Grand Marnier I used limoncello which was right on target. This isn't what I'd describe as a true pound cake which follows the 1:1:1 ratio (one pound each flour sugar and eggs with no leavening ) either in ingredients or texture. The crumb is far more delicate and it's more airy than a traditional pound cake. It's actually a very refined complex product. What it does share in common with a pound cake is how moist it is. Because of the baking powder the moistness is there with no trace of heaviness. Because I'm diabetic I skipped the additional sugar that the glaze would have added and it was never missed. The result was full of fresh lemon flavor. If you have limoncello an Italian lemon liqueur (I always keep a bottle in the freezer. Makes a fabulous summer aperatif!) I heartily recommend using it in place of the Grand Marnier which although most likely delicious too lends an orange flavor. I aimed to underscore not distract from the lemony taste. Topped the cake with home made strawberry ice cream and it was a dessert fit to make Escoffier weep!!",

However the cake was just okay and I didn't get any \"zesty\" at all. Couldn't taste the acidity of the buttermilk the flavor of the Grand Marinier or the ginger's zing. I had high hopes but it is actually kind of blah.",
