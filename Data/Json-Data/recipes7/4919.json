It needs a tsp. of lemon juice and 1 TBSP. cornstarch added to 2 TBSP. water.  Add to the rest of the ingredient list, blend then heat the syrup and it will thicken.  It will be a syrup more in keeping for pancakes, ice cream topping, etc.  Otherwise you have a fruit topping that is absorbed by your pancakes rather than laying on top of them.  If you don't like seeds, mash, then strain the seeds, (that's a lot of  work though...)  Easy, Tasty, winner recipe.  Thanks!",

I enjoy eating fruit syrups with my breakfast foods but they can cost so much and usually very limited in variety; this was a great save for my breakfast.

I had to mash the cherries down because they were large but I'm definitly adding this to my regularly used book.",
