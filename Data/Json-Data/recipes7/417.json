I wonder if it was supposed to be 1 hour on high and 1 hour on low or something. I know we all have different slow cookers but mine took over six hours on low to cook. The flavor was okay I did add some raisins that had been pre soaked. But it just did not taste right. I guess no one can be my Mom's old recipe. In tasting it right now it still feels like the rice is not done. Save the evaporated milk for another project. This was not a hit for me. Sorry!",
