My family loves bread and my husband is always looking for something that taste 'normal'. So this is as close as it gets for muffins.  They are actually really good. The extra applesauce really makes it moist and not too dry! The batter will look runny but when you take them out of the oven they will be nice and soft. I can't keep them long, they go so fast!",
