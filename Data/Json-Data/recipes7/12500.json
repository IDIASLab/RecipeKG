It gives you a hint of spiciness without overwhelming and it's an important ingredient to what makes this cookie special. I rolled the cookie dough balls in Turbinado sugar and the cookies' texture was just about perfect. The only thing that I did differently was to bake for 11 minutes instead of 9. Thanks Anisa for sharing your unique and delicious cookie recipe.",
