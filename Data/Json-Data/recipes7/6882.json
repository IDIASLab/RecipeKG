I did not add any more vegetables and feel like this is a definite keeper for the fall and winter months and will be great with rice or naan! I didn't make a side for this because of the starches in the potatoes but it went over really well and I am told has a very authentic taste.",

Like adding fresh minced ginger and Garam Masala (it's crazy how I just happened to HAVE that on hand!) Ok so here's what I did. I changed the serving to just 2 and didn't measure anything. I just tasted as I went. Boiled 1 breast in some chicken broth and while I prepared some jasmine rice in the rice cooker and saut\u00e9ed the garlic minced ginger onions with a little cumin sprinkled on top. (I like the flavor of carmalized cumin onions!) Then I cut up some carrots and threw in the 2 russet potato I peeled and cubed. Saut\u00e9ed a few mins then added Garam Masala Curry Tumeric and a dash of Cayenne as well as salt and pepper to taste. I poured a small amount of water out of the pot of boiling chicken (so it wouldn't be too soupy) and tossed the saut\u00e9ed mixture into the chicken and broth and boiled with one bay leaf. I kept adding the spices mentioned above as I went and tasted frequently. I mixed a little cornstarch with cold water and added that to thicken this up just a little and Toward the end I added a splash of lemon juice and mixed in a dollop of Greek yougurt. I finished it off by tossing in some thinnly sliced fresh green onion and served with a side of rice and steamed brocolli. So yummy! Even my picky 3 year old is eating it which is LITERALLY a miracle! I didn't even offer him any because I thought h",
