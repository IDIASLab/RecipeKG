It is always a hit wherever it is devoured. It is very rich and cheesy. Just about any variety / combination of the Cheddar Colby-Jack and other similar cheeses will yield favorable results. I also broil the last few minutes on low (but watch it CAREFULLY) for that golden brown finish. t is definitely worth the effort to indulge in this cheese-lover's delight!",
