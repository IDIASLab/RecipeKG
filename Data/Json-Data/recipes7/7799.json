But moistening the pectin with lemon juice and then stirring it in is ludicrous - it will form lumps and you'll still be stirring when next season's blueberries arrive.  Add the lemon juice to the crushed berries, stir in the sugar, then add the dry pectin a little at a time, stirring after each addition until it disappears.",

I'm so glad I did because the sugar never dissolved. I had to add more blueberries, pectin, and lemon juice to make it not taste like gritty sugar mixture. I ended up essentially quadrupling the recipe in all senses except the sugar. Then the instructions say to set it at room temp for 24 hours. I've never heard of this, most instructions say 30 minutes, then freeze for 24 hours. \n\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOLLOWING THIS RECIPE!",
