We thought it had an odd texture and was not sweet enough. I was going to throw the cake out last night, but, ran out of time and thought I would do it tonight. We decided to give it one more try tonight. What a difference after sitting overnight! The cake  was saturated with the milk mixture and was perfectly sweet and yummy. So, so happy I did not throw this out yesterday! Piece of advice if you're going to make this cake I would definitely let it sit overnight because it is so much better.",

Growing up in SoCal I've tasted tres Leches cakes before so was looking for a more spongey wet crumb. This cake while flavorful felt denser than anticipated. It was still good but the almond flavor was stronger than the cherry flavor and I would have preferred the opposite.",
