I used the same amount of fresh figs and skipped soaking them, just cut them up, then added the sugar.  In place of the sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt (just to use up what I had).  I also added a few chopped up walnuts.  Very good!",

Instead of 2 cups dried figs I used 1 cup of dried figs and 1 cup of fig compote which I just happened to pick up on a whim. When cooking them I omitted the sugar and lemon juice and substituted honey and 1tbs orange flower water. I only used 1 egg yolk for the custard and like a previous reviewer suggested I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also added 1/4 cup chopped pistachios. The only downside to this ice cream is the seeds if you're not used to eating figs.",
