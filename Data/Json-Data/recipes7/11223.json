If you want to prepare more than a few ears the above method is much quicker too.\n\nFor really fresh corn, this method takes a very short time and is great: Cut the silk end off where the cob ends, force a little water from the tap under the husks, then microwave two ears of corn at \"high\" for perhaps 5 to 7 minutes, allow to rest a few minutes. Then the silks come off really easy, and the corn is excellent. Butter, salt, and pepper to taste and chow down.",
