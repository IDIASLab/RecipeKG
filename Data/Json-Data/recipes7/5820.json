At first I thought only 2 cups of fruit would not be enough, since other fruit pie recipes call for 4 cups of fruit, but this is perfect.  Because the cherries are sweet and hold their shape, more is unnecessary and would probably just be too much of a good sweet thing.  I baked mine for 25 minutes at 425 degrees, and then another 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then the crust doesn't over-brown.  Thank-you so much for a wonderful summer treat!",

Like another reviewer, I also doubled the cherries to about 4 cups.  I omitted the cherry juice because I was pretty sure the filling would be juicy enough and it was (besides, I didn't have cherry juice on hand).  I ended up using 4 cups cherries, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and some almond extract.  No juice and no butter in the filling.  I used a 9 inch pie plate like the recipe called for, and it makes more like 10 or 12 servings, not 6.  However, it turned out fantastic, and with these amendments, it will earn a permanent spot in my recipe book!",

I'm happy to have it on hand for cherry season.  I used closer to 3 cups of pitted cherries to fill my deep dish pie pan.   I made this pie for the 4th of July.  With cherry or berry pies, I always try to bake them the day before and let them sit to settle and solidify.  It seems they are always best if they have time to sit before you cut into them.  The texture and flavor of this filling is fantastic!",

Using a Cherry Pitter from Cherrystop.com made short work of the pitting process.\r\nI also used my favorite pie crust recipe with the lard and butter.\r\nThis is the first Cherry Pie that I LOVED!  The others are way too tart and runny for my palate. \r\nHave made this recipe twice in one week...and I would highly recommend it, especially when fresh cherries are in season and affordable.",

I'm not sure if it's that my cherries are sweeter than average or people like their pies increadibly sweet but with my 1st pie using this recipe I found it almost too sweet to eat and most of the pie went untouched. My second time using this recipe I halved the amount of each of the sugars and it was perfect. I did use about 1/4 tsp of ground cinnamon in each pie and on my second pie I used a mix of cornstarch and flour just a personal preference. With the adjustment in sugar and the mixture of thickners this recipe is earning a permanent spot in my recipe box.",
