Of course there is the punch of the pepper which is great but the rest of the bread is doughy and flavorless. I like the idea of making them as rolls in a 9x13 pan and maybe adding some flavor to the dough. A mix of whole wheat and regular flour might help. Very easy. Upon further review (and eating leftovers!) I need to downgrade this - the bread is really not even worth eating sorry.",
