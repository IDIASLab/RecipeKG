This is a super recipe and very easy to make.  Thanks!",

I doubled the amount of broth and used chicken broth due to my allergy and used 3 cups of water. Everyone likes a lot of broth with their soups here. I added about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sesame oil to the broth to give it more flavor. It is now a rich and delicious accompaniment to the rest of the ingredients. Make sure you get a good cut of bison for this recipe. My local health foods store has a bison 'event' every three months but otherwise just has ground or an inferior cut off steak in their frozen section. I will be sure to stock up the next time their event rolls around just for this recipe! I could eat this on a weekly basis-its that good!",
