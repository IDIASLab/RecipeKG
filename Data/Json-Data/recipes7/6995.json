You would never guess that the dressing was made with a can of condensed tomato soup. I made this for lunches this week and DS and DH both enjoyed it also. I made the day ahead to give it 24 hours to meld. I did add a little salt and pepper to my serving. A nice alternative to a mayonnaise based pasta salad. Thanks misty for sharing.",

The sugar and vinegar quantities are correct and are required to balance each other. It is a good salad. I received many compliments on it. What I changed was the green peppers as I do not like them. Instead I added chopped carrots (added to the boiling water before I added the pasta.) I also roasted my own red pepper instead of the pimento (as they are hard to find where I live). I added salt and pepper after I tasted the salad. Thank you for the recipe Misty. I received many compliments. I will make this one again.",

The sauce was overpowering with the vinegar (I don't like vinegar much as it is) and the oil soup and vinegar did NOT mix well at all no matter how long I whisked it. This would have been a much better recipe with Italian dressing instead. I also left out the sugar because neither of us like or eat very much of it. 3/4 of a cup is a little much for a seemingly healthy salad.",
