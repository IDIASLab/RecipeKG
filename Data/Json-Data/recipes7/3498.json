A wonderful condiment to eat with this dish, and many other asian dishes, is Sambal Oelek, a garlic-chili paste you can find in the asian section of most groceries and asian specialty stores. It's quite spicy, and quite tasty.",

For short cuts I am a huge fan of Gourmet Blends so I used tube lemon grass basil and fresh ginger - but supplemented with fresh for garnish and presentation. I will for sure be using this recipe in the future. FYI - check the cooking time on the bag of rice I followed this recipe and in burned and had to redo (must have been my type of organic rice).",
