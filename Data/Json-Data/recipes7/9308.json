I placed one pack in the bottom of an 11X7 glass pan. I only used one brick of cheese because I thought mine would be smaller.  I'll use 2 next time.  I flattened out the cookies for the top and tried to be perfect, but I wasn't. The brownies came out great. Had to bake 10 more minutes because of the thicker brownie.",
