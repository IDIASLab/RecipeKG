First when you have your eggs all beaten use a mesh strainer to remove some of the larger bits of egg that will not mix through second microwave the custard on 30% for about 10-13 min. Now don't get me wrong microwave times vary. For my 1200 watt microwave I did about 12 minutes. End result was very silky smooth. Can even try substituting some of the milk with sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 C. milk. Hope that at least will help some.",
