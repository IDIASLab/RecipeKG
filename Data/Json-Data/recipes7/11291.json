Every recipe had sliced pork instead of cubed so I sliced it thinly and every recipe had either a slice or wedge of fresh lime to squeeze over the bowl. I had everything on hand for this recipe except the thick Vietnamese style rice noodles so I substituted thick spaghetti (Barilla). When the pork came out of the fridge it had soaked up every little bit of the marinade but its flavor was fantastic. On the downside the single thing that suffered most in this recipe was that it was dry but I think that's an easy fix. What I'll try next time is doubling the marinade and adding some pork or chicken broth to the saut\u00e9ed pork to ramp up the moisture level; probably will add more herbs too. Other than the dryness issue I have no complaints (hubby thought there was too much pasta). We liked it we ate it and I'll try again with a few tweaks to suit our tastes.",
