The pork was very moist and flavorful, but the sauce was just a bit too peppery for our tastes. When I make this again, I will cut the rub ingredients back to 1/4, and skip the rub seasonings in the sauce. The bits of the rub that are in the pan are enough to season the sauce along with the asian flavors, in my opinion. Thanks Buon Appetito!",
