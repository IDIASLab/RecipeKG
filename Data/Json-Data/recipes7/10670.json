Also you made need more sugar than a 1/4. I just pour sugar on a plate and roll the cookies. Last thing is I do believe the brands that you use make a big difference so I highly recommend using the brands listed above :) I have messed up and used reduced fat JIF PB and the cookies did not turn out as good at all! I hope you all enjoy this recipe and share with your friends and family :)",

And three times I came back, finally deciding oh what the heck - I'll give it a try.  This was the EASIEST QUICKEST TASTIEST blossom recipe I've ever tried.  No fuss - no frills - melt in your mouth delicious.  I'm SO glad I came to my senses.  Batter was a bit loose when I first made it - ended up throwing in maybe another quarter cup of baking mix (used the homemade stuff from AR recipe here), then let it sit in fridge for oh - maybe ten minutes.  Eight minutes of baking was spot on (although I did leave them sit on the cookie sheet after pressing in the chocolate kiss while I prepared the next pan).  So far I've already gotten 30 cookies ... will probably get another 10 out of them.  Thank you SO much for recipe!",

I give this four stars for convenience creativity and pretty good taste. I personally like it a bit sweeter and more peanut-buttery as I find other peanut butter blossom recipes so these may appeal to someone who doesn't have quite the sweet tooth as I do! This is just a preference. I can taste the Bisquick and find the Bisquick makes these a tad dry but a lovely shape. Also I noticed that this recipe doesn't brown like traditional peanut butter blossoms so don't overbake. Thanks for the convenient recipe!",

The cookie tastes very dry and clearly needs more fat in the recipe. One option might be to increase the peanut butter.
