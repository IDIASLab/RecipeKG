I didnt add the second dose of the chipotle either. The filling was a nice idea nut it didnt seem to pick up much flavor from the bouillon..I would recommend some salt to the filling and a little queso.. would make it a little easier to cut if the filling stuck together a bit more. This is a nice recipe and just needs a few tweaks for me I had the leftovers with some avocado and greek yogurt... I think that improved it for me",
