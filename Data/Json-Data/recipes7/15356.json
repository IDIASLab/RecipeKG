It was fun to make but it wasn't good. Not offensive or terrible but I wouldn't make it again. If you do decide to try this I'd recommend being light handed w the filling and don't heat the peanut butter or jelly too much. I used a little too much plus heated it too much and it was a little runny and as a result combined a bit too much. Still tasted like a pbj but didn't have separate layers like a sandwich would.",
