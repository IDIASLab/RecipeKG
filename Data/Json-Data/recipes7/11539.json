They are easy to make (and I am definitely no baker!) simple and absolutely delicious! A little tip: the first year I did as instructed and spread the filling on and it was a huge mess! Since then I have used gallon sized ziplock bags with the corner cut off (DIY piping bags) to put the filling on and it works great. So much easier and less messy and it makes it much easier to put roughly the same amount on each cookie! Highly recommend this recipe!",
