After much discussion and looking at pictures, we settled on this recipe.  (I really think he has his holidays confused, but it's ok with me if he's happy.).  I changed my method, proofing the yeast without the flour and adding ingredients liquids first, but I stayed with the paddle instead of switching to the dough hook.  I think I would have gotten a better rise if I had kneaded the dough. I also adjusted the spices, cutting the cloves to a scant 1/8 tsp and being a bit more generous with the nutmeg.  I skipped making the crosses and the sugar glaze and just used the icing to skim the tops.  Oh, and I found the buns I baked in my 9\" square pan rose better than the 3 I baked individually on a sheet pan.  Nice recipe, I will play with it a bit and have it ready for Easter.  Thanks for sharing.",

They won't rise correctly and, if the originator does not have this problem, they need to look at these instructions and make corrections.\n\nFirstly, the starter had too much flour and no sugar, which the yeast needs to activate.\n\nMine were edible, but lumpy looking and dense.  I shall return to my British cookbook next year.  Sad, really, as most of the recipes I have used on this site are cook-tested and do turn out, even if I don't prefer some of them.",
