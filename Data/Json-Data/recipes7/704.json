The kids always look forward to making them together just before the rest of the meal is ready.  As we do, we talk about taking sinless Jesus (marshmallow), anointing Him in oils (butter) and incense (cinnamon), wrapping Him in the shroud (crescent roll), and then placing Him in the tomb (oven). We always make at least two batches and they go fast.  It's so fun to see everyone open their \"empty tombs\" at the table.  \n\nMy advice: 1. don't skimp on the crescent rolls -- use the name brand.  They really do hold up better; 2. Keep the crescents refrigerated till needed; 3.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes; 4.  Don't worry about the leakage - they're just as good messy! Just use a stoneware baker with shallow sides or a jelly roll pan with a parchment paper liner; 5. When you serve, don't use napkins or doilies -- they can be very sticky.",

I dipped the marshmallows in butter, then rolled them in cinnamon-sugar.  After rolling each marshmallow in one triangle, I rolled another triangle around it in the opposite direction.  I crimped all edges, then rolled the entire thing in butter and then in the cinnamon-sugar.  I baked them @ 375 for about 20 minutes; when I took them out of the oven, they smelled heavenly!  There were absolutely no holes or leaks or any sign of the marshmallows on the outside, so it was just as much of a treat for me to break open the tomb to find it empty.  My kids were in awe as they realized the lesson in what we had done -- that which our Savior has done for all of us!  Thanks for a new & wonderful tradition.",

Jesus is the marshmallow, and He is anointed with oil (butter) and spices (the cinnamon and sugar) before he is wrapped in expensive cloth (dough) and placed in the tomb (oven).  Our our year old caught the whole of the Easter story through this symbolism.  It's quite clever.",

Some marshmallow seeped out of every one of them, some more than others.  (It's not really a problem since you want the inside to be hollow anyway.  When I make them again for Easter, I will take the advice of some of the other reviewers and use two pieces of crescent roll for each.  The dough actually isn't very thick with one, so I don't think it would be too much.  I will also leave out the sugar and just roll the marshmallows in butter then cinnamon.  The marshmallows alone would make the rolls sweet enough.  Good recipe, and a fun thing to try.",

I would recommend cutting back the temperature (maybe to 375) and the time to 10-12 minutes. They were a little well done. I would definitely recommend a trial time if you are planning on using these for Easter Sunday morning!",

I read most of the reviews and really tried to figure out how NOT to let them leak. First I tried by rolling each triangle a little thinner before rolling around the marshmellow. Next I tried the \"seal with a fork\" technique to close the edges of the dough. Last step was to apply a small dab onto the seams to try and seal them even more. Of course it didn't work!! Maybe they are suppose to ooze out onto the pan! I did line the pan to prevent a big mess. The end result was a sweet tasting crescent! Kids loved them and wanted me to make more. Next time I will try them with mini marshmallows to see if they are easier to roll and seal.",
