I actually put it in a large ovenproof bowl and baked it an hour.  It was a hit, so much I'm making it again to share with the rest of my family!  Throw it in the oven when baking the rest of your dinner!  Your family will be happy for such a great, easy gluten free dessert!  A little whipped cream also tastes great on top!",

The only real change, for me, has been to use two TBLS to cook it at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes.\nThat might be the fault of my oven but I am pretty sure this will need to bake for more than thirty minutes.",
