I don't know whether they are authentic or not but I was very happy with how the cookies turned out. The smell while they were baking was strong enough that I wondered if the spiciness would be overwhelming but they tasted sublime. I made a couple of significant modifications: - halved the recipe with no problem - substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour - added two eggs plus enough additional flour to make up for the liquid in the eggs. I wanted the cookies to rise a bit and the eggs did the trick nicely.",

I ground fresh anise cardamon and cloves plus put in a little extra of each because we like them extra spicy. Use a lot of flour when rolling out the dough. It can be sticky.",
