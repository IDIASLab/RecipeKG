The peach habanero mix was way too spicy with three peppers and the dough did not roll out smoothly with 3-tablespoons of water. I would keep adding water until it looks/feels like dough instead of adding until it looks crumbly. Ended up smooshing together enough dough for the bottom and then had to resort to a store-bought pie dough to finish the top. Would definitely continually taste the puree as you add peppers throughout the process to see if it is too spicy or not.",
