It was a little too sugary for me half way between a meal and dessert with not a whole lot of flavor other than the sugar (and I LOVE sugar). It was also difficult to get it cooked thouroughly in the center since I doubled the recipe. So I had to cook it for an extra 30 minutes. I definitely plan on making this again but next time i'm sure it will be great if I cut the sugar in half and also add something that will compliment the sugar like 1 lb of breakfast sausage.",
