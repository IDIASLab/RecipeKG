Then I sauteed some sliced almonds in butter and smothered them in cinnamon and sugar to put on top of the custard when it was done.  The only caution I have for less experienced cooks is that putting the eggs into the hot mixture will, very likely, cause you to have lumpy egg parts in the custard.  I went against my better judgment and did it anyway...then decided to strain it just in case.  Sure enough, there were egg lumps in there.  So, either strain it or add a little bit of the chocolate mix to the eggs before you add them to the saucepan.  That should take care of that problem.  Oh, and if you're impatient like me, you can put the custard in your freezer to cool it faster.  I had mine cooled down in about an hour. The custard was incredibly creamy and delicious and I'd make this again any day when I felt like I needed a serious chocolate fix.",

Callebaut unsweetened chocolate shavings I followed the instructions with the addition of splitting/scraping/simmering the vanilla bean tempering the egg yolks straining the mixture then cooling it in an ice bath like you would a ganache (mine took 1 hour in the fridge) prior to pouring it into my canister. Turned out great perfect consistency and the perfect amount to fit into my 1.5 qt gelato container after the kiddos lick the paddle and get a small scoop of course.",
