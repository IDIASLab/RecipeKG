I've made regular ambrosia with sour cream, oranges, pineapple, and coconut, but I like the healthier option of using yogurt, and it tasted every bit as good. I think the tanginess of the yogurt offsets the sweetness of the marshmallows, and if your strawberries are a little on the tart side you could balance it out by using vanilla or pineapple yogurt. I might modify my own regular recipe next time, by substituting yogurt and adding strawberries to all the other fruit. Still, this recipe is five-star, just as written. Thanks eclectricity, for a great recipe and a great idea!",
