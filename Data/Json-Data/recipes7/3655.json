I threw some chopped green and yellow peppers and chopped parsely on when I served it. Thanks for the recipe - nicely done!:)",

I made a roux instead of using corn starch and I used beer instead of water (beer makes everything taste better). Finally I added a splash of cream at the end because I realized I added too much hot sauce and needed to mellow it out. Got great reviews from everyone I served it to. The sauce was flavorful and spicy. Served it with some roasted asparagus but next time I think throwing vegetables right into the sauce would be better--but that s the Yankee in me.",

Also, Kebalsa and Cajun just don't do together Shaa, so please use Andouille or a good smoked sausage and you'll have yourself a delicious, authentic Cajun Pastalaya that everyone will love. My pasta preference is Penne or Ziti, but Rotini and Bowtie is also good. Cest bon!",

Been making it for almost 3 years now and never get tired of it. A friend of my sons has had it and then ordered at a restaurant.

The second time I prepared it I made the following modifications: Added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (gives it some heat which we found to be just right). Added 1/2 cup chicken broth (I used bouillon) and a splash of sherry plus 2 Tbsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup water (as written this sauce is a bit dry). As others have mentioned this recipe needs peppers! I chopped up some small sweet peppers which were a great addition. I reduced the amount of pasta to 16oz which is quite enough. That extra 8oz of pasta the recipe calls for is literally 8oz too much. We blended all the sauce and pasta together and found the proportion of sauce to pasta to be very good. I used orecchiette this time but the linguine is also good - they each hold the sauce a bit differently.",
