I decided to do a creme brulee one year, and found several recipes that looked interesting but none were quite what I wanted. I ended up combining a couple, then tweaking until my hubby said, That's it! Now when the torch comes out, everyone starts swarming! I've even found hidden dishes in the refrigerator where someone has saved one for themselves.",

I wanted to use up some white chocolate chips that had being hanging around way too long and despite the stabilizing they are made with it worked out fine. All that being said this was amazing. It was creamy and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.",
