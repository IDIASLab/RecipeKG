I used 2 per cent milk in place of the whole milk and whole milk in place of the half-and half. I used light condensed milk 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/3 cup of peanut butter (as some indicated it was too peanut buttery). I couldn't find miniature peanut butter cups so used 6 regular sized cups chopped. To deal with the thickening issue other reviewers identified I beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (I have a Kitchen Aid electric mixer - so things usually need less time than indicated) for 4 minutes. The cooking time to make the custard is then the 5 minutes as it's already thick to begin with - and because the recipe makes a custard the lower fat milks still yield a creamy texture. I'll definitely make again and add some skim milk next time just to see the results.",
