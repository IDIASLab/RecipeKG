                "reviewBody": "I made this recipe pretty nearly but not quite. I changed the 1/4 cup white sugar to Organic Coconut Palm Sugar and enhanced the sweetness with 1 T Stevia/1 T xylitol. I also reduced the amount of lemon zest to 1 t. because I often find zest a bit bitter. I also substituted unsweetened almond milk for the soy. Soy is sometimes bitter; almond is smoother. The dough was a little too moist before adding the stevia/xylitol but was perfect after that. It was easily worked and not sticky at all. I cut mine into 8 wedges and separated them a little before baking in order to crisp all the sides. The result was a dough that rose just slightly (puffy) to make a perfectly textured scone lightly browned but with a moist (but not too moist!) center. I wasn't sure how my sweetening adjustment would work but it was just right not too sweet not too much like bread. They were like a lightly lemoned sweet bread. Really really good. My calculations put a 1/8 wedge at around 160 calories without the glaze. (They're so good they don't need a glaze.) I can't believe how much nutritional GOODNESS is packed in so few calories! I will definitely be making this again.",
