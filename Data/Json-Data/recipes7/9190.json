I also personally didn't care for the combo of pineapple and chocolate sauce - but I did use fresh pineapple canned would have been sweeter and probably tasted better. With the bread you would normally use for French toast (if you have a regular type you use) and a strong liking for the pineapple/chocolate combo this could be quite delicious. It smelled amazing cooking! As written it just wasn't for us. Thanks for sharing!",
