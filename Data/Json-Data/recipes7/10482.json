But, this is a lot faster.\n\nThe temperature of 500 degrees is correct.\n\nThe aluminum foil keeps the biscuits from burning.  But - get the biscuits off the hot cookie sheet ASAP after brushing with butter.  Put them on a cooling rack to finish cool. \n\n\nThese taste great for 2 - 3 days after cooking.\n\n\nThe melted butter added before cooking adds flavor.  The melted butter after cooking produces a nicely browned look.\n\n\nFlipping over the ends and re-rolling produces a layered flaky biscuit - easy to spread jam on or eat without any toppings.\n\n\nI do not have a round cutter.  So I cut these into squares or rectangles.  The taste is the same and it cuts down on the preparation time.\n\n\nThe recipe can be doubled or quadrupled without any changes (except sometimes adding a little more fluid)\n\n\nThe recipe can be made with a combination of 1/3rd milk and 2/3rds cream.  Just make sure you brush the biscuits with butter before cooking and the taste and texture is almost the same.",

This is so much easier, and the end result is fantastic. I didn't have any problems with the dough being too \"soupy\" or too sticky, as some of the other comments said. I was surprised at how wonderful this dough was to work with.\nJust one thing, they are kinda sweet, which is delicious, but depending on what you're planning on doing with the biscuits, you may want to cut back a bit on the sugar.\nAfter dinner, we were all standing around the stove, munching on the leftover biscuits, straight from the baking sheet. Yum!\nOh, I did change the oven temperature, simply because 500 made me nervous. I baked them at 450, and they came out perfectly. But that was just me being chicken. :)",

I've tried famous name brand recipes, celebrity chef recipes, and highly rated recipes.  This is the one that has gotten the highest praise.   It seems way too simple, doesn't it?   No pastry blender needed!  This was the first biscuit recipe I tried when I began this quest for baked perfection, and after all the different attempts, it has not been topped.  I am a novice baker, too, so I don't have experience, skills, or special cooking tools.  I simply watched Chef John's video repeatedly until I worked up enough courage to bake biscuits for my husband, the son of the world's greatest Southern cook.   You can't lose with this recipe!!",

Do keep an eye on them in the oven b/c after 9-1/2 minutes, my bottoms were just on the verge of burnt (my oven temp is spot on too), so I'm thinking maybe it had something to do with using foil?

The cream biscuits are DELICIOUS, and EASY to make!  My mother (God rest her soul) tried to make biscuits for my dad, but the poor things were like little rocks.  Dad ate them though, because he knew mom tried her best to please his southern taste buds (She was midwestern).  I'm self-taught in the baking world, so anything I'm interested in making has to be researched, and then I do the trial and error thing.  THESE biscuits are the result of about 10 different attempts at making biscuits.  I'm not going to look any further.  My whole family LOVED them!  My husband ate three of them right after they came out of the oven.  My picky younger son said he'll fight for the remainder of them!\n\nThey are fluffy, SO not DRY like a lot of the other recipes are, and there's no tedious mixing of this and that.  Even a novice like me had NO PROBLEMS!\n\nTHANK YOU!  THANK YOU!  THANK YOU, Chef John, for this AWESOME recipe!!",
