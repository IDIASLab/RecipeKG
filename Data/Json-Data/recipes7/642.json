I used just 1 tablespoon of sugar and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Instead heating the milk mixture over the stove I just wisked everything together in a mug and microwaved it for about 2 minutes. After the milk mixture was nice and hot I topped off the mug with some strong brewed drip coffee instead of espresso. I wasn't so sure about putting canned pumpkin in a latte, but it actually was very very good. Thanks for the great recipe!!!",
