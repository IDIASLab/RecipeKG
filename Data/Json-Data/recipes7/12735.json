However the dough was too crumbly and dry so I had to add a couple splashes of milk; actually dumped the dough out of the mug into a larger bowl to ensure it was all properly combined and not still so dry thereby defeating the simplicity of just preparing in the one mug. Also I know that microwave powers can vary considerably but I had to zap mine for more like 2 min. to not have it look so wet and raw. It popped out of the mug w/ a spoon (and had to be eaten w/ said spoon) and daughter loved it and wants to make it again; me not so much. Fun to experiment in the kitchen w/ her and like it said it tasted like a chocolate chip (oops I used mini choc chips) cookie so thanks for sharing your recipe!:-)",

You have to be patient though and let them cool so they can actually acquire cookie texture. Over all I definitely recommend!",
