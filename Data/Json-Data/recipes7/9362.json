UPDATE Made this yesterday (above) using Justin's peanut butter and they came out beautifully. Tonight I made them using regular Jiff extra crunchy peanut butter because my husband likes some crunch in the cookie and they came out verrrry runny so I added probably a 1/4c of quick oats to the done mixture and that thickened it up nicely. I think the kind of peanut butter you use makes a huge difference!",
