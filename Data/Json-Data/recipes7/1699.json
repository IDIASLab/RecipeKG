I made the Apple Spice Cheesecake for them and have been told this has been the BEST cheesecake I have ever made.  Then I made the Reese's cheesecake for my ladies' group (we need chocolate) and again they also thought it was the best.  I highly recommend and look forward to making more variations!  I did however change the crust to a more traditional graham cracker crust for the Apple Spice cheese cake by using 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, a stick of butter melted, and 1 cup of sugar.  For the Reese's Cheesecake I used the Famous Chocolate Wafers.  I used 2 cups crushed wafers and one stick of butter melted to make the crust.  I like the thicker crusts and could not see how 3 Tbsps. of crumbs could make a crust.",

I followed the recipe's directions exactly, struggling somewhat with configuring the foil around the springform pan, but finally got it right! Also, I used the Famous Chocolate Wafers to coat the sides and bottom of the pan...a very, very thin coating that really didn't leave a crust at all once the cheesecake came out of the oven.  Couple of suggestions: the Master Cheesecake recipe says forty minutes in the oven (in the bain marie).  My batch could have gone another 8-10 minutes (and my oven was calibrated at 325 degrees).  Then, as the recipe stated, I turned off the heat and left the oven door ajar for thirty minutes.  Also, I don't understand just using 3 tablespoons of crumbs to line the sides of the pan...not enough.  Should I have not lined the bottom of the pan?  I guess I am use to the traditional thick graham cracker crust.  Anyway, bottom-line here: excellent taste and texture and so light that you \"almost\" feel guiltless eating it!",
