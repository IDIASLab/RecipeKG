While it may have several steps, the recipe is still simple enough and easy enough to follow even while you and your hubs are making a dinner together with several different dishes!  And even when you scale the recipe down to two servings, which necessitated not only a different sized baking dish but different baking times as well.  Simply put, this is excellent.  First, the filling, cooked in advance of its going into the oven, is beautiful with its little bit of butter and the maple syrup.  Creative and delicious, for sure.  Second, the crust, much like a pie crust but with the unusual addition of sour cream.  Tender and buttery good.  And the topping, which left me at first thinking it would never work.  Not only does it work, it\u2019s outstanding. And the three of these components together?  An ethereal, old-fashioned, comforting, curl your toes, you thought you died and went to heaven dish of fresh peach loveliness.  I\u2019ve written so many reviews that I wish I was a better writer, so that I could effectively communicate just how awesome good this dessert is without sounding stale.  The submitter suggests this same recipe can be used just as easily with other fruits. But I just can\u2019t imagine it being any better than this.",
