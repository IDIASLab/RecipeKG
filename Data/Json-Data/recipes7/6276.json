Use 1/3 CAN of tomato soup and divide the rest into two labeled ziplock bags and freeze for the next time...no point in wasting it and all you'll have to do the next time is throw the frozen \"chunk\" of soup in when it's time.

I added 2 tbsps. of ginger to the marinade. I also used equal parts sugar and vinegar and added all the juice from a 20 oz. can of pineapple chunks. (I only used half the can of pineapples though. The rest are sitting in the fridge for a healthy midnight snack later.) I completely omitted the tomato soup and carrots as my family is not a fan of either ingredient. Next time I make it (and there will DFEINITELY be a next time) I am going to dredge the chicken pieces and add the bell pepper with the chicken and pineapples. I love when the recipes I find here actually work!!",
