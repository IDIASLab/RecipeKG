The only thing I do different is make it in a 9X13 and double the sauce, everything else is done as is.  I strongly recommend using a stand mixer with a hook to knead the dough, the smoother it is, the easier it will be to roll out.  I always end up adding an additional 1/2 C to 1 C of four, just until it pulls together into a ball and adding an additional teaspoon of salt.  For the sausage patty, which is a MUST (don't brown and crumble, for authentic Chicago style pizza, you must use the patty) I fold a sheet of foil into a template the size of my pan, spray with cooking spray, spread out sausage to the edges, invert over pan and peel back.  No mess, no fuss.  Also, I use a long sheet of foil folded into a strip to crimp around the top of the pan to protect the crust from browning to much, it works very well.  It's a labor intensive pizza, true.  But this is a $35 dollar pizza at Uno's, I make it once a week for around $8.  Call it \"sweat equity.\"  Good luck!",

The crust was great though! The sausage patty added a LOT of grease to the pizza but then the diet conscious probably aren't going to be indulging in deep dish Chicago style pizza; ) Certainly need to cover the edges of the pan in foil so the crust doesn't over-brown. I left the sugar out of the tomato sauce just not a sweet sauce fan.",

A few things I did differently: I tripled the sauce recipe. I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a large can of petite diced tomatoes and cooked the sauce for about an hour which gave the sauce a great texture. It's a sweet sauce so if you can cut back on the brown sugar if you don't want it as sweet. When layering the middle I layered it as follows: cheese pepperoni chicken cheese sauce (about half of what you make) pepperoni chicken cheese and then topped it off with the crust. Seal the edges and pour the rest of the sauce over the top:)",

I've made it twice once exactly as written and the second time with my own sauce which for our palates improved things tremendously. The sauce recipe which is slightly sweet and disappointingly bland loses one star. If a nice hearty appropriately spiced tomato sauce is used however the recipe benefits exponentially and it's catapulted into the 5 star stratosphere. Also I added about 1/2 cup of the sauce to the filling ingredients in the middle which increased our enjoyment and tied everything together nicely. It's extremely filling and no one but the heartiest of eaters will be able to consume more than one slice without busting a gut. Because of the fat in the sausage which melds into the crust as it bakes it's not healthy but this is a favorite very occasional guilty pleasure in this house.",

I moved away from Chicago in 1993 and apart from a couple of visits over the years I'd never found a way to buy or make a good version of my favorite pizza until using this recipe. I even looked into Giordano's mail order service at my most desperate - thanks for saving me that 75!",

The crust was good though so I may make a different stuffed pizza sometime in the future with my own fillings instead of this recipe.",
