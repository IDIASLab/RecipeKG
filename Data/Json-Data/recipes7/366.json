I didn't use frozen berries just fresh and by the time they sat in sugar they had made a really nice juice on their own. I served this with Easy Whipped Cream from this site and it was one of the best desserts I've made. Update: I made this a second time for the fouth of July and doubled the recipe. Make sure to freeze the butter before grating. I tried it both ways and it is much easier to grate the butter when it is frozen. It took a lot less time and it was a lot less messy!",

I didn't follow the berry instructions (I just used fresh strawberries with sugar & topped w/ whipped cream), just the biscuit instructions. A couple minor changes: I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used 2% milk - it worked perfectly. I didn't freeze the butter, but I did used very cold butter. Loved the grating technique. I also added to the recipe a bit of vanilla extract and about a scant 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom. I had never tried the cardamom before but had seen it in other shortcake recipes. Wow, was it ever a great addition. Anyway, this was soooo yummy. I will never look for a shortcake recipe again. One other thing - use cooking spray on the baking sheet. Thanks for a great recipe!",
