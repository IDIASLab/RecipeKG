I let them sit overnight and even in that short time these were waaaaay to vinegary. Additionally the Lemon flavor was so strong that they had a shoe-polish taste. I also don't think tarragon was the \"right\" herb for this taste combo. No one in the house could eat these and I ended up throwing our both jars. Quite disappointed in the outcome of this recipe. Really was excited about the idea and may try again using much less vinegar and maybe a tiny shred of lemon. Dill perhaps instead of tarragon. As least this was a concept I will explore another time.",
