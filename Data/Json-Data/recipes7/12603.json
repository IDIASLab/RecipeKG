With an ounce of whiskey and only one cup of sugar you won't have frosting you'll have soup. Cream cheese frosting is usually 3 to 4 cups of powdered sugar not one. If you try and frost your cupcakes with the frosting as described you'll get goo that runs off the top of the cake. Keep adding sugar until your frosting firms up. (between 3 and 4 cups)",
