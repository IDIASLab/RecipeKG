We cut down on the sugar and increased the water so they were equal parts of 1.5 cups (your basic simple syrup recipe), and added TWO packets of drink mix.  This really kicked up the flavor, so when you pour it over your snowcone it doesn't taste \"watered down\".  Thanks for the recipe - I'm now the most popular Mom on our street!  :)",

I followed the advice of other posters.  First I cut back the sugar to 1 1/2c. & increased the water to 1 1/2 c.  I used 2 packages of drink mix for more flavor.  We also added lemon juice because we don't like things too sweet.  I used dehydrated cane juice in place of refined white sugar which didn't affect the flavor at all.  In one flavor I used the kool aid \"clear\" w/no artificial colors.  It was the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor.  I then colored it w/a little beet juice.  This flavor was voted best among everyone who ate our snow cones!  I will definately look for more of the Kool Aid \"clear\" since some of my kids are sensitive to artificial colors & frankly it's not good for any of us.  Next I'll try one poster's suggestion to use Loranne candy flavorings.  Thank you sooo much for a great recipie & great suggestions by others!",
