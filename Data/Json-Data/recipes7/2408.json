I didn't really want that...so I made a couple changes. First of all I whipped the cream instead of boiling it. I folded the sour cream mixture into the whipped cream and really liked the results. It was smooth creamy rich and lightly sweet. Also because we are a non-alcohol family I used 1/4 tsp. of orange extract instead of the orange liqueur. This gave it a pleasant and slight orange flavor which really complimented the strawberries. I used more like 4 cups of berries and layered them in wine glasses along with the cream. The end results were beautiful and very tasty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!",

We never have alcohol of any kind in our house, so we (my sister and I made this together) used orange extract in place of the Grand Marnier (I've heard that orange juice concentrate would also work...). Another change we made is that we whipped up the cream with the yogurt, sugar, vanilla, orange extract, and sour cream instead of heating it on the stove. Them we made a parfait (check out Larkspur's awesome photo) This was PHENOMENAL! Thanks so much! :)",

The thought of warm whipping cream mixed with the other ingredients didn't really sound like something we would enjoy. So I whipped the cream and folded it into the yogurt/sour cream mixture. I also used Patron Citronge Orange Liqueur (perfect substitution!) then layered the strawberries and cream added a couple of orange segments and chilled for a couple of hours before dinner. This turned out to be perfect for us. My husband has already started giving me other ideas to change this up with other fruits/flavors. He really loved this and thinks \"The Recipe \"Thingy\"\" I participated in is a great idea! Thank you Recipe Group and thank you to the submitter of this recipe for sharing!",

Instead what I found was a very thin cream. Everyone who enjoyed this \"fixed\" the recipe and to me that means they created their own. When whipping cream is heated it loses the enzyme which allows it to whip. Thus you are left with a runny mess. I was not pleased and will not make this again. I wish people had registered stars that were associated with this recipe and not their own versions of it. I'm sure their versions are fine however that's not the recipe \"as written\".",

I used more sour cream in place of the yogurt as I don't use plain yogurt and didn't want to get a big tub that wouldn't get used. I subbed the Grand Marnier with orange juice and a little lemon extract. It still tasted a little like a creamsicle but with the strawberries gave a very nice flavor. I probably would not make this again unless I whipped the whipping cream and folded everything together and used it chilled. It does make for an elegant dessert that would finish off a meal with something not too sweet and not too tart. Thanks Hoonde for the recipe.",
