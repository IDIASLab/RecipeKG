I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure my sons would like it one did and one didn't I think it was the texture of the filling as he has texture issues. For the cream cheese I used 1/4 of an 8 ounce block I have never seen a 3 ounce package in Canada. For the 1/2 egg yolk I took 1 tbsp egg yolk from the crepe recipe. I omitted the salt as I used salted butter and I didn't drizzle melted butter over the finished Nalesniki but served with blueberry marmalade I made. I used the Basic Crepe recipe from Allrecipes which makes 6 crepes with a 1/3 cup measure. Thanks for a delicious recipe!",
