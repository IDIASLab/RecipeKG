If you love curry..and I love me some curry.. this soup is for you!  I basically followed the whole recipe, except I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Curry powder and a 1/2 tablespoon of Garam Masala (sp?).. I think without the Garam Masala it might have been lacking some depth of flavor...it adds a nice spicy taste (more of an earthy spicy not heat) .. if you don't have Garam on hand you could try adding some ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, cumin and black pepper..  I also used 1 percent organic milk instead of the half and half.  And just a warning.. this soup is spicy!  But in a good way..not an overpowering spicy where you can't taste anything.  I will definitely be making this again... maybe tonight ;)  I might add some butternut squash next time.. I took a picture of the soup and I will upload soon :) Thanks for a great recipe!",

I think the curry worked well with the carrots, but I will reduce the amount of curry next time. I don't have a high tolerance for spicy food, so it was a little too much for me. If you like spicy food, then this should be fine. I used regular milk instead of the half and half and it seemed to dilute the soup to a nice consistency.",
