I did add 1 tbsp. of lemon juice to the milk to make it like buttermilk and I had to add a little more milk as the batter was a bit dry. I liked this, it's like something you'd buy at Starbucks to go with your coffee. If I made this again, I'd add a little vanilla and double the glaze. This is a very eye-pleasing loaf.

But, got curious to compare this recipe and I made it on Monday. Yummy...my new favorite lemon blueberry combination!! The extra blueberries and the sour cream makes this so moist. I like a more pronounced lemon flavor, so used 3 T of lemon juice and 2 T of lemon zest in the batter instead of whatever was produced by 1 lemon. Drizzling with  lemon glaze is going to make this a perfect summer dessert...I can't wait to try it in a bundt pan this weekend.",
