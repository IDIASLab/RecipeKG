The last time I made it, I marinated the cherries in the port wine first, then cooked them according to the directions listed.  Yum!  I've also subbed with strawberries too.  Just FYI, I wouldn't try to feed more than 4 people with a goose this size.",

The soy sauce just gave it an odd taste but my hubby-to-be loved it. I did marinate the cherries in the port wine for about an hour. Since I wasn't a fan of the sauce I squeezed some of the cooked lemon and orange onto my portions which made it good enough for me.",
