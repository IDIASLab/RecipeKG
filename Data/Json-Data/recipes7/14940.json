        "description": "This is my grandmother's Cuban picadillo (ground beef hash/chili) recipe which is usually served with white rice, beans and plantains. Picadillo also goes great with mashed potatoes and can be made without the squash. This dish is a favorite at home so I usually make 2 pounds to have leftovers for making empanadas (meat pies) the next day. Picadillo also freezes well. Of course my kids say this is the best picadillo they've ever had and I have to agree!",

I peeled and cut that half into cubes, but if I\u2019d used  all of it, the meat/sauce mixture wouldn\u2019t have even covered the squash.  I ended up using about a quarter of a small squash.  I did use Spanish tomato sauce which gave it a little kick of heat, and added a whole bay leaf (not ground bay leaf) to the picadillo, removing it before serving.  I typically add potatoes to my picadillo, but the butternut squash was a nice change.  I live in Florida, I\u2019ve eaten a lot of picadillo (love it, too), and this is a good recipe.
