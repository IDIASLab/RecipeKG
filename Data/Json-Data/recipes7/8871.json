I added bottled lemon juice to make 1/2 c total (I had read that the avg lemon has about 1/4c juice) I think fresh lemon made all the difference. Next time I will use 2 fresh lemons. I ended up with a ton of batter so I made 18 muffins which turned out somewhat small so next time I'll make 12. The taste of these is amazing- moist and lemony!! I'll never use a mix again!!",

I used nonfat Greek yogurt because it's what I had. I thought the thick consistency of the batter would make for dense muffins but they were very light moist and delicious. I only had several small lemons which I used but next time I'm sure the two large lemons will yield the right amount of lemony-ness. Thanks for sharing!",
