This was very quick to make and would taste good on just about anything breakfast or dessert. I put it on a homemade belgian waffle from this site with whipped cream and it was great. I am some what partial to the top rated strawberry sauce on here that has a little less sugar and some added vanilla but this will definitely get eaten up. Thank you",
