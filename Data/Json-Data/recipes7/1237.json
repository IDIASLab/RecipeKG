Used whipping cream from the refrigerated carton (on-hand), and it worked out wonderfully. This is a Restaurant-Style cheesecake for sure, only better. Used fresh, cut up, lightly sweetened strawberries on the side after chilling the cheesecake instead of using the strawberry pie filling.  Wonderful! Thank you for sharing the recipe.",

I wasn't sure if I would like it at first as I'm a very plain cheesecake lover, but this was amazing.  Next time I will add some crushed raspberries and cool whip to the top. YUMM!!!

                "reviewBody": "I made the crust for this and found that 2 1/2 cups of graham crackers wasn't near enough. The crust ingredients looked way too greasy and wet, so I used another cup or so of crumbs. I used Splenda in the crust as well. I did bake the crust for 8 minutes to crisp it up a bit and to help melt the sugar so it wouldn't crunch when you ate it. (It only takes once to have that happen, it's not pleasant.) I used low-fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, fresh lemon juice and \"free\" whipped topping. I found out at the last minute that I didn't have any canned pie filling on hand, so I whipped up my own with frozen berries, Splenda and a couple other ingredients. This was a few steps but the outcome was nice and it's sure to be a real crowd pleaser tonight. NOTE: The recipe dosen't say that you should set out your cream cheese and let it come up to room temperature. If you don't do this, you'll have lumps in your cheesecake and it's a little embarassing to have your friends and family bite into clumps of cream cheese. EDITED REVIEW: Out of that whole pan, only three pieces remained! HUGE hit. HUGE.",
