When she realized she didn't add the eggs or salt the recipe called for, she thought it would screw up the cake. But the cake came out so moist and yummy I made her write down the recipe, skipping the eggs and salt. She frosts it with vanilla frosting while the cake is still warm to give it a glazed effect. My family loves this cake.",

This recipe was slightly dense however I think it plays it into it's favor because it can easily be baked in a jelly roll style pan and made as snacking bars for after schoolers. I thought it still had a nice flavor and I could taste both the banana and oatmeal. TY very much.",
