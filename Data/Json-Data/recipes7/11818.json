I am glad I did and followed the recipe exactly otherwise because the base flavors are balanced well. After heating I did still think it tasted like a pumpkin spice coffee regardless. I did spray the whipped topping on as recommend. I plan to buy the pumpkin and try it again though. I liked the kick to this and that it did wake me up. ty",
