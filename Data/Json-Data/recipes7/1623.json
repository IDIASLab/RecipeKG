Only suggestion I have is I made batches with both regular cupcake pans and mini cupcake pans. The regular sized ones came out slightly harder to eat, and stuck heavily to the cupcake wrappers I used. This was quite irritating when trying to eat them. Also, there was almost too much cornbread to hot dog ratio.(cut each dog into 1/4 pieces)  On the other hand, the smaller Mini ones I made with my nonstick mini pan, I cooked a few minutes less, in these I used 1/8 of a hotdog pieces, and it worked perfect. They were so yummy, everyone ate these and left the big ones after tasting both. Perfect hotdog-corn mixture ratio. They weren't as floppy as the big ones.Fun to eat! I will definitely make these again, but from now on will use the mini cupcake pans only. ",

I cut each hotdog into 8 equal pieces. Using a small cookie scoop I put a full scoop into each well of my silicone mini muffin pan placed a hotdog chunk into each one and topped them off with about 1 teaspoon of batter. I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the dipping sauce decreased the taco seasoning to 1 tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon of milk to make it taste like Taco Bell's Santa Fe sauce (the sauce they so cruelly discontinued!).
