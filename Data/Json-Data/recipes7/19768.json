I followed the recipe except used fresh-squeezed regular lime juice. Key lime juice was not available. Next time I will cut down on the amount of lime zest. There was too much for me. The one thing I did add was I toasted some shredded coconut and sprinkled it on top of the cake. It added some sweetness and texture. The lime curd was very tart and the coconut helped to balance it out. I will definitely be making this cake again with those two minor changes. Oh and next time instead of a yellow cake mix I am going to use a white cake mix.",

I suspect a double boiler would have worked better, since I tried 3 different bowls over a boiling pot of water and couldn't get the juice/sugar mix to boil. It got up to aboout 190 deg so I went to the next step, adding to the eggs. It came out fine, but next time I will probably use a different curd process (for instance see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHg2XlakQGE) . Otherwise the recipe worked very well. It's so worth it, a favorite.",
