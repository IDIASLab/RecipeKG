For those who want no waste, take those egg whites and cook yourself some eggs. I also don't recommend using a blender. I tried and got mayo on my face.",

This recipe is fantastic!  He raved about it and now wants me to share the recipe, so he can do the same.  Thanks so much for taking this upon yourself, so I didn't waste my time and food supplies.  The only thing I did differently was use apple cider vinegar, but I'm sure it's just as good with the white, just what I was used to.  Thanks again...",
