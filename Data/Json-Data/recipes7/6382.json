We found it to be a little dry even with the 'Lemon Sauce II' from AR that I made as a topper. (Submitter suggested a lemon sauce). By covering the leftovers with a tight fitting lid the dessert softened up and we enjoyed it so much better. If I were to make this again I would cut back on the crust/topping layers or add about 3/4 cup more applesauce. I did sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top before baking.",

I rarely have lemons on hand so I used about 2-3 Tbs lemon juice. The taste isn't as strong as some reviewers say they can taste the lemon zest but it does add a bit of liquid that helps to keep the dough together. The dough resembles shortening/flour \"crumbles\". Just grab half of it and mold into a ball then press into the glass dish. Cover with applesauce mixture then grab remaining \"crumbles\" and sprinkle over the applesauce. It should cover the whole pan. Press down lightly add some cinnamon for flavor and color bake for 40-45 mins and it turns out incredible. Can't wait to add ice cream!",

I used homemade applesauce which has more flavor than most store brands. Do sprinkle a little cinnamon on the cake prior to baking. The cake took about 60 minutes to bake. Not sure what happened with the cake of the rater who said it was dry...mine was not. I'm very glad I made it in spite of the 'dry' comment! I used the Lemon Sauce 1 recipe (since I had the lemon left from the cake) and it's perfect (cut back on the nutmeg and use a bit of cinnamon) as a finishing drizzle. Yum! Everyone loved it.",
