The texture of the quinoa kind of threw me off at first, but as they cooled they felt more like a muffin cookie in your mouth. The bottoms got nice and crispy/caramelized. I put in 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and 1/4 chocolate chips instead of all chocolate because we love peanut butter more and the ratio was perfect. They weren't too sweet either. My hubby really loved these.",
