Instead I used frozen raspberries and was very pleased with that result! Boysenberries would also work nicely with this lovely recipe! I have a funny story to add to this: I had just finished placing the lattice top and fluted the edges of the crust then pondered if I should brush the top with an egg wash. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had forgotten to add the eggs to the fruit mixture! I literally hollered in frustration as I realized the eggs were absolutely necessary and considered the mess of pulling everything apart in order to mix them in! I mentally cast about for a remedy and then remembered my marinade injector syringe! I quickly beat the eggs and then sucked them into the injector! I injected them between the lattice-work and saw the yellow stuff squishing back up...Fortunately it all worked out fine! The pie looked beautiful and no one was the wiser! The moral to the story is: Even when faced with a potential culinary disaster there may be a simple solution right at hand!",

                "reviewBody": "This was my first attempt at a lattice top pie as well as my first attempt at a strawberry rhubarb pie. The flavors were wonderful but I did run into a few problems. 1) The crust cooks quickly and should have been completely covered with aluminum to prevent it from over cooking. I took the pie out early to prevent burning but then not all of the rhubarb was thoroughly cooked. 2) This is a very runny filling. I will probably add tapioca flour and reduce the number of eggs to 2. Also I think it would be worth letting the fruit sit in the sugar in the fridge overnight and then straining out the excess juice. I will also be adding more fruit as I like my pies bulging with fruity goodness! Thanks for the great inspiration though. The crystalized ginger really makes this pie!!",

I love rhubarb (and who doesn't love strawberries?) but have never liked rhubarb/strawberry pie because it always seemed to be made with jello.  So my rhubarb pie is a custard-based pie.

I used \"Alan's Pie Crust\" recipe for the crust and added rolled oats to the topping just because. Serve it warm with vanilla bean ice cream on the side-delicious!!
