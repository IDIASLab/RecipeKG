However, as this recipe's first reviewer, I regret that after preparing this recipe I have to say it did not impress me.  Ultimately this was very good, but only after a whole lot of monkeying around with it.  As the submitter suggested, I made this in individual sized portions. First, I had to add more flour to the \"crisp\" to get it to crumble nicely. The proportions of butter/brown sugar/flour are off (too much brown sugar I think?)  and made it kind of pasty rather than crumbly. Second, there weren't nearly enough apples for all that topping so I had to increase that too - which now meant I had to play around with the initial sugar/cinnamon mixture as well.  I baked this in individual shallow ramekins, about 30 minutes at 350 degrees and while it ended up being delicious I'll move on to another recipe where the measurements of ingredients are more accurate and reliable.",
