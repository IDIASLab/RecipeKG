Some reviewers are finding it too sweet, however. If you're very sensitive to sweetness, replace the recommended amount of sugar with a 1/4 teaspoon of sugar.\n\nI would put this note in the actual recipe, but Allrecipes made this one of their \"official\" recipes and now I can't edit it.\n\nI'm glad most of you like this recipe, and I appreciate every reviewer who took the time and effort to leave me feedback.",
