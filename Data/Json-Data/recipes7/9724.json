Also, because sizes of lemons vary, I hope it's helpful to note I used  1-1/2 tablespoons each of lemon juice and zest and was quite happy with that. Oven temperatures and darkness/lightness of pans (which can affect baking time) vary too, so I'd recommend checking this at 50-55 minutes - mine was done in about 52 minutes!",

                "reviewBody": "There were several good things about this recipe. The bread was very lemony (I used the zest of two lemons in the bread)and moist-but a bit too dense. I baked it in an 8\" round pan because I knew I would love the glaze (which I made thicker and increased the quantity)and I wanted more surface room for it. In my opinion the glaze makes the bread. The coconut was barely discernible in flavor-some didn't realize it was there- but does change the texture. If anyone has an issue with this (or any other quick bread or cake) being DRY I suggest to check what kind of milk was used. Skim milk is much more likely to produce a dry, crumbly product. Milks with fat in them really improve the flavor and texture of baked goods. So little of the product is used that it doesn't make a huge difference in fat content. Also- as always...use fresh lemon juice because bottled lemon juice has mellowed way to much to have any great flavor. With all baking-the end results will only be as good as the ingredients used.",

I followed the ingredients substituting only GF all purpose flour (using white rice, potato starch and tapioca starch with 1/2 tsp xanthan gum).  I had to use almost three times the lemon juice for the glaze though.  I did change the directions to adapt to GF flours.  I allowed the flours and liquids to sit for 10 minutes (stirring occasionally) then added the baking powder, mixed well and then put it in the oven.  This soaking time helps the rice flours and starches to soften a bit to lend to a smoother texture.  In fact it wasn't grainy at all.  As you can see in the photo I made it in a 9\" round cake pan so it baked for only 30 minutes.  I didn't have the right size loaf pan.  It worked wonderfully.  Great taste of the lemon with the coconut.  My daughter, who isn't gluten intolerant, loved it so much ate almost all of it asking me to make it again \"exactly like this don't change a thing!\".  There's a great rating for you!  Keep in the fridge for a longer lasting storage.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

Just a few suggestions:  Use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan to prevent the loaf from sticking (mine got stuck and the bottom didn't look so pretty when I got it out).  Microwave your lemons (about 30 seconds)...you'll get way more juice out of them!  Also I could do without the coconut.  Didn't really do much for the loaf.  Other than that...love this recipe!",
