Still made the entire sauce amount without scaling since I wanted sauce for not only the meat but mashed potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding. Oh MAN was this good. I did not understand the point of making the sauce after browning and then saving it for later I just made the sauce after the meat was done and resting. Worked great and saves steps and items to cleanup. Also added some fresh thyme in addition to the rosemary. This is the way I want to cook this cut from now on the entire roast was very uniformly cooked. PLUS that sauce is freaking delicious. Oh I used beef stock instead of chicken and cabernet sauvignon for the wine. Sensational thank you.",

The first time I made it I use the garlic and rosemary and the roast turned out delicious. For Christmas we forgot the fresh rosemary when we went to the grocery store so I just used salt pepper and olive oil. I think the real winning tip here is to remember to leave the meat out to get to room temperature and also to brown it before roasting. I have only been \"on meat\" for about a year since I am a former vegetarian of 15 years and not super experienced in cooking meat yet. Both of my brother in laws said that the roast was cooked perfectly (which apparently is hard to do?). I also thought the roast was very tender and tasty. A couple more things. I thought the perfect doneness was achieved around 145 degrees and I added more corn starch to my mushroom sauce because I prefer my sauces a little thicker. If you want something to make for a special occasion or maybe you picked some prime rib up because it was on sale this recipe is a real treat!",
