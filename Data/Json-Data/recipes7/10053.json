The texture of the muffin was soft and moist and did taste like cantaloupe. The crumble topping was crunchy and had great flavor. My husband liked them very much and thought they were a nice change. I thought they were good also but seemed to be missing a little something for me. I will make again but maybe add a little more vanilla or take the suggestion from the cook's notes and add some blueberries. The only thing I did different was to add the crumble to the top of the wet muffin before I baked and didn't add after partially baking. They also only took about 22 minutes to bake so it is will just depend on the size of your muffin tin. Thanks for the recipe!",

I also added half a cup of unsweetened coconut flakes (Bob's Red Mill), skipped the lemon zest, and used only half cup of white sugar. They were ready after 23 minutes bake time.

The praline topping creates quite the \"Wow\" factor although I usually just sprinkle w/cinnamon sugar. The most important direction missing in this recipe is that you must drain the juice out of the fruit puree which usually removes half of your volume so measure your cup of fruit after this step. As with most of my baked goods for home use I substitute whole wheat pastry flour for some of the flour and add no more than 1/4C ground flax seed for added nutrients.",
