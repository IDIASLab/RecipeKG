Moist, pleasantly spiced and delicious, and the addition of the pineapple, as well as the raisins and walnuts, gives this zucchini bread it's unique character.  I've always been proud to serve or gift this bread and when I do, it's not unusual that it's followed by a request for the recipe.",

The pineapple gives it a tangy moistness the raisins give it the right amount of sweetness and the wonderful crunch of the walnuts makes this a keeper for all seasons!

Came out very moist and yummy, and was still moist the next day (other recipes seem to dry out overnight). DH told me to be sure not to lose this one as this is his favorite zucchini bread recipe (I've tried many this season with a bumper crop of squash).",

Great texture (not overly moist) wonderful balance of flavors and textures and bakes up perfect everytime.

Follwed the recipe with the exception of using dried cranberries and almonds (personal pref) in place of the raisins and walnuts. Two loaves disappeared in just a couple of days.
