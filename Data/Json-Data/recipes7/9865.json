(I didn't plan on that, it just happened) Add the broccoli first and sprinkle with a tiny bit of sugar and add 1/4 cup broth, cover and steam for about 5 minutes.  Remove from the wok and add the mushrooms (I use fresh mushrooms) and snow peas - cook for just a couple of minutes.  Remove and add the beef and marinade - it will cook in about 5 minutes, maybe less.  I added about 1/2 cup of broth at the end to make more sauce.  Add the broccoli etc... back in and toss.   Without the addition of the broth there would not have been enough sauce.  Serve with rice - quicker than driving for take out and so delicious.  Thanks!",

Beef can be marinaded in small and equal amount of soy sauce, wine, and sesame oil (with small amount of corn starch) for about 15-20 minutes. Room temp is good enough. Try to use Kai-lan (Chinese broccoli or Chinese kale) instead of broccoli to make it more authentic. Tip: cook the stems first and add florets later to avoid over-cooking.",
