I think this version is a little too thick and peanut buttery. I added an extra 1/2 cup of water. Next time I will only use 1/3 cup of peanut butter and add a 14 oz. can of coconut milk and 1/8 cup water. I thought it needed a little more flavor so I used 2 1/2 tbls. soy sauce 2 1/2 tbls. rice vinegar 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (to add some kick) and 1/8 tsp. sesame oil. I thought it was just a bit too sweet so next time I'll only add 2 tbls. of sugar (esp. if I use coconut milk). I like my tofu crispy so I drained and cut extra firm tofu into 2\"x1\" pieces salted the cubes and deep fried them in 175F degree veg. oil for 3 minutes until golden. I wilted the spinach in a couple tsps. of oil in a skillet and drained it in a collander. I also added a 10 oz. can of mock duck. Top the dish with some chopped peanuts and it's perfect. YUM!!",
