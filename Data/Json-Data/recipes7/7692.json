I used elbow macaroni, a can of condensed milk, and cinnamon and nutmeg instead of cardamom.  I also added a little shredded coconut that I had on hand.   The key is having the patience to wait until it goes from soup to pudding in the saucepan!  Thanks for the recipe!",

It took me 5 mins to bring it to a boil and about 10 to get the vermicelli cooked. By that time the liquid had almost completely boiled off, but I just added some more milk like the recipe suggested.",
