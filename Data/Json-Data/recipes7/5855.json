They tasted like a very cakey chocolate chip cookie mixed with a gingerbread cookie. I made 1/2 the recipe and got 33 cookies which was plenty. I realized the spices called for cloves and it got me worried about the final flavor. I think of Christmas when I think of cloves. So I decided to do half the cloves suggested. However it was still way too strong in my opinion. I let a couple of other people try one and one of them said oh you made gingerbread cookies. So I realized I was not the only one. I hadn't even mentioned what was in them. I can only faintly see the zucchini. It almost looks likes pistachios and it can't be tasted at all except for their texture a bit. I did eat a couple of them and the taste did start to grow on me as they cooled. It is possible I may have thought differently of the spice of this cookie on a Christmas tray. I don't know.",

I replaced the margarine with butter cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup for half a batch and would cut it back to 1/2 cup if I make these again. I omitted the cloves because we just don't care for them. I increased the cocoa powder by 1 tbs and probably used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I love the way the cinnamon flavor plays off the chocolate and generally found them to be moist but more cakelike than I prefer. The dough was too soft to roll into balls even after chilling for over an hour so I just used my cookie scoop and that worked just fine. You would never know there is any zucchini in these cookies.

Mine look a little stringy due to the zucchini being in longer pieces than I realized but it wasn't apparent until it was in the dough and only affected the look. I also don't care for cloves so replaced with nutmeg but then accidentally halved the cinnamon and ended up a little bland. I used butter and white whole wheat flour as I always do and replaced the egg with a flax/water sub due to allergies. All in all it sounds like a lot of changes but not really and I ate three right out of the oven so I think with the correct spice measure these would certainly be deserving of 4 stars even though I personally prefer a less cakey cookie.",
