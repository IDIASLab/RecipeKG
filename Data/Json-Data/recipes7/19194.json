If I had one thing I'd do differently, it would be to add a touch more cocoa powder to the cupcakes--I like a really strong chocolate flavor, and wanted it to stand out a bit more for my personal tastes. The cupcake batter itself was super liquidy, but it did bake up well. They only needed 18-20 minutes to bake in my oven, and the recipe made 23 perfect cupcakes. I ended up adding a full tablespoon of espresso powder, a 1/2 cup butter, a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of heavy cream to get the frosting to the flavor and consistency I wanted. I did not have enough to frost all 23 cupcakes, but I think another 1/3 batch of frosting would have covered that. Overall, we really enjoyed these! Thanks for the recipe!",
