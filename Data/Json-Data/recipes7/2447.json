I mixed the blackberries peaches corn starch and splenda in a large pan over medium heat until warm. I left as much of the resulting liquid out as possible. I also mixed in a little cinnamon and nutmeg into the filling as well as adding some to the crust after buttered. Turned out great. Not too liquidy. Next time I will cover the perimeter with foil. My outer crust got a little too browened in that first 15 minutes.",

The crust looks so amazing and has a nice rich flavor combined with the fresh fruit which creates a step back in time for many people...and they think I'm amazing!!
