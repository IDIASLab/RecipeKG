After rinsing the lime away and soaking the cucs in ice water, it says drain the water from the cucumbers and put them in a large pot.   In the next step, it says to mix alum with 1/2 cup vinegar and pour this over the cucumbers in the pot, then cover the pot and bring the water to a boil.  BUT THERE'S NO WATER IN THE POT!!!!\n     I had a recipe for this 30 years ago, but my ex snagged all my recipe book collection in the divorce.  Saw this and am in the middle of making it...but??  I'm going to add enough water to cover them, but it will probably take 3 gallons of water so I'm unsure if I should add more alum or not.  I soaked these in a measured food safe plastic restaurant container, and cut into rings the cucs took up 12 quarts of space.",

But it is recommended by the National Canning and Perserving Organizqtion that you change the water every hour. Not eliminating the lime properly can lead to botchlism. Also another reviewer had mentioned this for one of the steps it says to boil water but never tells you to add water. But it also forgets to tell you to add the 11/4 C of water to the syrup mixture. After pouring the syrup over my cucumbers it does not seem to be enough to cover them nor will it be enough to pack 6 jars. Should have spent more time searching the recipe. Now I've invested two days in this recipe and there is no turning back now but who knows if they will turn out.",
