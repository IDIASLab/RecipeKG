                "reviewBody": "The butter and sugar separated after 10 minutes of stirring. All was going well it was looking syrup-like... I turned it down a tiny bit (0.5) and - boom - separated into sludge and melted butter. I am going to try this again and I may revise my rating. I would really like to make roca that uses butter instead of corn syrup so it is worth an experiment or two. With corn syrup when the sugar mixture is the colour of a brown paper bag then it is ready. I don't have a candy thermometer to know if it is ready at 350 or to know if it gets there. Round two!.......................When you do it right this recipe is amazing! So I learned that butter and sugar can be finicky. The butter should be melted at low heat first. Then add the sugar. Stir it constantly - for realsies - constantly. If your mixture separates you may be able to save it by taking it off the heat and mixing. If that doesn't work - try adding a spoonful or two of cold water and mixing it to get them to go back together and then gradually adding it back to the heat...............When I did it right it was so delicious I had to make more because I ate most of it myself. I bought tons of butter and chocolate chips when they were on sale at Thanksgiving so I am making this for Christmas - a lost batch did not empty my pockets and I felt free to try it out in different ways. The aluminum foil is a great addition and really reduces clean up tremendously. So tasty!",
