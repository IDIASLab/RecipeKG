It looks as tho' it might have been around a good while, and what a shame it's been left unnoticed.  These cookies are rich and buttery, tender and light.  Just delicious, prepared in a heartbeat with just an unbelievable five ingredients.  The ingredients and measurements for them are reliably accurate; the instructions  simple, concise and well-written.  The submitter suggests pecan halves or jam as options (I particularly like the jam idea) but I wanted something fall-ish so I pressed the top of the dough balls in fall sprinkles  and then pressed a teeny mini peanut butter cup into each.  This cookie is appropriate for any season or occasion and there  are fun and limitless possibilities for decorations or toppers.",
