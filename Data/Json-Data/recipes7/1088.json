I did not use the whole amount of salt (just enough to flavor it without going overboard) I added some fresh ground pepper and because I wanted to skip the cornstarch I cut back on the milk. I used fat free evaporated milk which is a little thick on it's own. I used just enough to give it a creamy flavor really no more than a third of a cup. For us we didn't really care for the cloves in this soup recipe. I think I'd like to try this again without it. Then it would be just right for our family. This was crazy simple.",

When our garden started producing more tomatoes than we could eat I decided to cook and freeze this soup. I follow the recipe almost exactly except I use less salt and more sugar. Instead of 2 C chicken broth I use 1 C tomato sauce and 1 C broth. Great and healthy recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I followed the recipe loosely. Very loosely. Eight tomatoes was too vague for me. Eight large tomatoes? Eight medium or eight small tomatoes? When I brought in a big bowl of tomatoes from my garden today they ranged in size from teeny to behemoth. (I grow several different varieties) The size of the tomatoes used for the recipe would definitely affect the outcome. So I kind of winged it but weighed what I used for purposes of this review I used just a tad over three pounds and ran them all through a food mill before proceeding with the recipe. I found the directions to cook the peppers until slightly charred a little confusing. I m not sure how you d do that with them chopped in a pot with a teaspoon of butter. When I think of charred I think broiled or roasted in the oven or over a flame. Suffice it to say I sweated out the peppers and onions and added the garlic during the last 30 seconds or so before adding the tomato puree and the chicken broth. I used no sugar cloves oregano basil or cornstarch I wanted nothing other than the rich sweet red-ripe tomato flavor enhanced by that of the bell peppers. When it came time to add the milk I used a combination of milk and heavy cream for extra creaminess and richness. Upon serving I gave each bowl a small dollop of pesto which complemented the tomato like brown mustard does a brat. This soup along with BLTs was homegrown tomato nirvana.",

I also grilled the tomatoes (to get the skin off) and bell peppers. It was a bit messy but certainly came out great! Served this with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site--yummy!",
