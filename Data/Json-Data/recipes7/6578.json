Here it goes; I used a Trader Joe's pie crust. Pre-baked it for about 10 min & did egg wash and sprinkled some Turbinado sugar along the edges of crust for a little browning and crunch.  I also preheated a flat baking sheet before placing pie pan on top to help cook bottom of crust.  \nUsed a tart pan, for visual effect.  Sprayed it with oil.  I find it browns the crust a little.   The filling,  used the Meyers lemons, I used an organic sugar, cut out 1/2 c.  Will cut down a tad more next time I make it. I also added 3 tbs Red Mills Tapioca flour, for a little thickening, a pinch of salt,  1 tbs reg. lemon rind as well as Meyers.  Followed the cooking directions. The only thing I didn't  know if it was normal, my pie had little air holes all over top. Not sure if I cooked it too long or not enough or is that the norm.  Anyone else experience this?  My man loved it, he didn't think it was too sweet.",

After cooking and setting, the pie was about 1/2 inch deep.  The crust was soggy and stuck to the pie pan.  I gave it three stars, because despite how horrible it looked, the taste of the filling was delicious. Will have to figure out something else to make with the filling.",
