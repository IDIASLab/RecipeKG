I used the calculate button and made 2 servings, which ended up being easily like 4-5 servings. I only had semi-sweet 1 oz squares and just used that and regular milk. The key to these type of fudge sauces is to make sure to never cook them above low, as suggested, the entire time. On my stove that is button 3 typically. Temperatures above that will turn the sugar/sauce gritty. Tastes good with just a little on some vanilla ice cream. On the ice cream it also thickens up, and strangely tastes a little less overly sweet.",
