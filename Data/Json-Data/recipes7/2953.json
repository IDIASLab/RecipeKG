It is not an easy fruit to prepare, as it needs to be poached or cooked before it can be used in recipes. Quince paste is a wonderful accompaniment to cheese and crackers-try chevre as well as other mild, firm cheeses. You can also serve it for breakfast in place of jam.",

I halved the quinces, put them in a pot and barely covered them with water.  Cooked for 40 mins or so until they were soft.  Then I scooped them out with a slotted spoon and ran them through a food mill/ fruit and vege strainer aka the thing with the auger and screen that separates flesh from seeds and skins.  I strained the liquid that remained and returned it to the pan and reheated it to dissolve the sugar.  Remixed it all hot and was left with something the consistency of applesauce.  The only thing I had to watch was that the volume of seeds can jam the auger so I had to clear it once.  Huge time saver over peeling first, plus less waste.",

The first time I tried them, I thought, \u201cWhere has this fruit been all my life?!\u201d I think I added too much water, though, during the quince cooking stage. Next time I\u2019ll add a couple of cups to start with, and add more if needed. From 4\u00bd pounds of whole quince, I got more than 5 lbs of quince puree! Like I said: too much water. It took a long time to cook down. I spread it into a pan and left it in a 100 degree F oven overnight (we have a \u201cbread proof\u201d cycle that was perfect for this). Wonderful! As good as the membrillo we had in Portugual. Perfect with crusty bread and slices of manchego cheese. It made a ton, so I'm giving away slabs as gifts to a select few!",
