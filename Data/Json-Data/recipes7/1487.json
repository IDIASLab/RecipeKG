I then added a small package of chopped up strawberries and a package of blueberries.  I used about 1.5 cups of white sugar, 3 Tbsp. of vanilla extract, and to thicken at the end cornstarch (mixed with water first to avoid clumping).\n\nThe smell in the house was divine and this'll go great over ice cream as a compote.  Thanks again!  Wasn't sure how to cook rhubarb or with how much sugar.",

Although this can be eaten just as is, or served over ice cream...the way grandma served it (and the way we eat it most often) is stirred into plain yogurt...in those days there were no flavored yogurts and so this was a special treat to make plain yogurt good. Now we just eat it with plain yogurt because it is just plain good that way!! Try it...way better than any fruit flavored yogurt you'll get in a store!

I have never added cinnamon or fresh cut-up strawberries (as one of the other reviewers suggested) and I thought both added to the flavour. To save time I cook the rhubarb (about 3 cups) in the microwave in a high-sided dish with a lid. To the diced rhubarb I add just enough water to cover the bottom cover and cook until the rhubarb is soft (usually less then 5 minutes) then I add the sugar to taste (and this time I put in strawberries and cinnamon as well).",
