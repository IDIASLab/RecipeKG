The meat itself has little taste. The texture is like biting into a tuna steak or very tender chicken. The only issue here is the amounts. Four cups of batter is way too much for ten pieces of canned jackfruit. Each piece is about 2 inches. I made batter with one cup of flour and made seven pieces and still had 1/2 the batter left over. Also the batter slid off the first piece. So I dregded each piece with some flour first and this made the batter stick. Thank you for the recipe.",
