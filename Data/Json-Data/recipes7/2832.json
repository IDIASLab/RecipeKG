Very good and makes the whole house smell delicious but I modified it by adding 2 tablespoons cinnamon into the mix chopped pecans white raisins and I had to add a little more butter (3 tablespoons) and 2 more eggs because after I mixed it all together it was too dry to bake. Also I substituted the sugar for splenda because thats all we have in the house and I didnt want to go out and buy more and it tastes fine!
