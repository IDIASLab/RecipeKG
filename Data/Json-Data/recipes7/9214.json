I have two little kids and wanted to make a ketchup without high fructose corn syrup, and to use in our homemade BBQ and sloppy joe sauces.  It tastes just like the bottled stuff. I skipped the white sugar & put in 1/3 c of honey instead, to make it even less processed. Canned crushed tomatoes made it easier to strain at the end, and the consistency is pretty good. I would skip the added water next time when using the honey.  This is a keeper! I'm so excited that I found this recipe & it was so easy using the slow cooker.",

Let me say that my Favorite Ketchup by Far- is the recipe for fermeted ketchup in Nourishing Traditions.  It's EASY and tastes better than anything you can fathom when thinking Ketchup. But I hate to cook a fermented food and I needed a cookable Ketchup for BBQ Sauce. So- I made this, and it turned out great- but I carried over some ideas from my favorite Ketchup.  To the Gallon I used 1/2 cup Fish Sauce, skipped the clove, and used 1 cup honey in place of 2 cups sugar. I used some red wine and some white wine vinegar (just because it's what I had)- it turned out as good as Heinz, and Almost as good at the Fermented stuff I make from NT. Good stuff- no corn syrup, no junk. Also, if you used strained tomatoes you don't have to strain when you're done. Just put all the ingredients in the crock pot, leave the lid off and it's done in a few hours. Worth it- as long as you make a lot and freeze the extra.",

You have to pay attention to it, and stir every few minutes, but from the time I started chopping to the time it reduced, it was just over an hour.

Pretty spot on ketchup flavor, my kids were surprised when they tasted it. I did make some adjustments/changes 'though. I used brown sugar and used a little less, I used cider vinegar instead of white, used 1t of garlic powder instead of 1/2, cut back the salt to 1t and used maybe 1/16t (or just a dash) of ground cloves and added 1T of oyster sauce (fish sauce would also work). My wife despises seafood, but she has no idea there is oyster sauce in it. I don't often cook from recipes, preferring to learn the whys and hows, and I think this recipe gives you a great sense of the ratio of tomato:sugar:acid to start with. And cooking in the crock pot was slooooow, but allowed me to do other things on my day off. I agree with others and if I wanted it done faster I would do it on the gas an pay attention to it.",

Have tried many and have not been able to consume more than the first few bites of any of them! I made this less than a month ago and we are on our last few drops! I did make a few changes: swapped out the white sugar for 1/2 the amount in Truvia, crushed tomatoes instead of ground, Pink Sea Salt crystals for the table salt, and finally... left out the celery salt only because I didn't have it on hand nor find it anywhere to buy (didn't even know it existed). Got started late in the day; forgot about it cooking in the slow cooker (thankfully on low) and went to bed. Woke up Sunday morning to the most fantastic aroma wafting throughout my house! UNTIL I realized... OMG! MY KETCHUP! It turned out great though! Making second batch with the changes above and found the celery salt! Thank you so much for your hard work in putting this together for all of us to enjoy!",
