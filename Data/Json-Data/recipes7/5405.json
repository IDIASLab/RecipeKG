I intend to make this again and fix a few things that happened for me while making this. First I couldn't decide between deep dish and regular crusts. I've learned this recipe needs deep dish! In the shallow crust the rhubarb was pretty mounded up (I was hoping it would bake down a little which it did). There was too much custard- as I poured slowly it would spill out the sides and at a certain point I gave up and poured the remaining custard into a cupcake tin for a second dessert; this is also an issue that can be fixed with a deep dish pie crust. As the pie baked even more custard bubbled up and spilled out so definitely put a pan underneath to catch the drippings otherwise have fun cleaning your oven. Small issues aside this was a huge delicious hit at the party I took it to and I would love to make it again.",

We didn't have light cream so I added 1 Tbsp of melted butter to the 1/3 cup milk. We used a 9.5 inch pie pan. Nothing bubbled out. We covered the edge of our crust with foil & removed the foil the last 10 minutes. We are making this again today for a teacher appreciation luncheon. Thank you!",
