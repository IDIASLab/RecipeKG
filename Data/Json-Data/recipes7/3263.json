The dish is very sweet more of a dessert than a meal. I think the rice was lacking something not sure what since I am not good at figuring that out but what was lacking may very well have been the heavy cinnamon that would have come from the pears had I poached them right. All in all quite good. When I make it again with the pears poached the right way I'll re-rate.",
