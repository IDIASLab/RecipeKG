The directions were easy to follow. I was surprised how quicky the batter came together. The only little change I made was using 1/2 teaspoon almond extract rather than the lemon. Lo and behold this cake was moist, flavorful, and much more substantial than boxed or store bought Angel Food. I cooked up a cup of frozen raspberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and a tablespoon of cornstarch making a sauce to pour over the cake. My family loved it. This should do well in lower altitudes if the egg whites are whipped longer, and 1/4 cup less flour is used. This was my first attempt at home made Angel Food, and it turned out great!",

I usually fold the paper in half then in half again... and then cut it to look like a slice of pizza (using the radius of the pan to measure.) Once I have the right size I'll cut the bottom for the center hole. This helps avoid leaving 1/2 of the cake in the pan. It tastes good either way but it is prettier when it stays in one piece.",

Coarse texture almost tough and not good taste. I then made this recipe the next night and oh the difference. I live in Thornton Colorado a north suburb of Denver so the high altitude is always a challenge for cake baking. This recipe however has been adapted for our altitude and was amazing. Rose well light texture amazing taste. I took it for my friend's birthday cake and the 5 of ate and ate. I also used a recipe from Allrecipes for buttercream icing that was incredible. It is now our new favorite cake recipe bumping dark chocolate cake out of first place!",
