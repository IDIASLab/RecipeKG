I accidentally deleted the photos I took but I chose to swirl the homemade caramel sauce into the bars. This resulted in some minor \"cracking\" at the edges from the caramel swirls but what it did for the flavor certainly made up for it! I chose to use all cracker crumbs instead of pecans. These were very substantial--a thicker than normal cheesecake portion--which made for an even prettier bar! YUM! Crowd-pleaser!",
