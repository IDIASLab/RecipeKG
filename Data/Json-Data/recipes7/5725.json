My husband is a huge fan of grilled pork chops so I had to give this a try and I'm glad I did! I used thick cut bone-in chops and added a little minced garlic and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar cutting back on the water a bit. These grilled up perfectly - Thanks for yet another wonderful recipe Marianne!",

By infusing the pork with the salt, sugar, and fresh herbs, you get a nice, juicy pork chop.  You can grill it however you like it.  Some people like the flavor of apple juice rather than water (we don't), so that is an option.",

I used dried herbs because I didn't realize that I never planted thyme. While they were marinating I ran to the nursery like a good \"AR Addict\" and bought and planted thyme. Of course I added the 2 sprigs first. This was so juicy and flavorful that Hubby claimed it doesn't need to be served with applesauce it can stand on it's own moistness. 10 minutes on each side was perfect for my grill. I kept the temperature of the grill around 350-375. Thank you Marianne for sharing your recipe. I will be marinating all my pork chops this way for added juiciness.",
