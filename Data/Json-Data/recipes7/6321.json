I'm an old-fashioned country cookin' 67 yr old grandma who loves highly seasoned food. I tried this recipe because it is so similar to mine. In my recipe I add 1 teaspoon vanilla to the batter; 2 teaspoons cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the dry cocoa/brown sugar; equal parts hot water and hot milk. The cake is more flavorful and the sauce is creamier. (I use brown sugar in ALL chocolate batter.) Sometimes I would add a bit of flavor to the hot milk/water and lightly dust the top of the baked cake with powdered sugar. I've also made this cake by combining all the dry ingredients for the sauce/pudding add the hot milk/hot water mix well pour over the batter. It worked for me! Deeeeelicious!!",

It must have been a Freudian slip.  I also added \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla to the cake base and boiled the water before pouring it on the cake.  I\u2019ve made several pudding cakes but I like this one the best.  There is plenty of chocolate sauce and it has great chocolate flavor.  This was a last minute thought to make for dessert and had I planned to make this earlier I would have saved leftover coffee to add to the liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor.

I appreciate the way THIS recipe was written with measurements given in step order and accuratet to that step. When 2 T of cocoa powder is listed when it is actually used and the 1/4 C of cocoa powder is listed later when it is used errors are avoided. Beginning cooks make mistakes when TOTAL ingredient amounts are listed in the ingredients section. Experienced 40 year bakers like I am appreciate breaking them down to make baking faster. ALL recipes should be written to facilitate the baker/cook's \"mise en place\" time! Unfortunately americastestkitchentv.com uses the total ingredients method. I do so detest errors when I cook and any site that saves me from the wasted time of figuring out a fix to a recipe that was badly written or saves me the time I would waste in rewriting a recipe properly is my friend! Hot Fudge Pudding Cake II is one of those poorly written recipes. I rarely make baking errors anymore and they really annoy me when I do!.",

                "reviewBody": "I was trying to find a pudding cake recipe like the boxed mix they used to sell in my youth. This one seemed easy enough. Unfortunately I also found this a bit watery and sickeningly sweet. Like another reviewer; I too reduced the sugar (1/2 cup in the cake 2/3 cup in the sauce) and added about a tsp of vanilla to the cake. I also needed to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the cake as the batter was literally like biscuit dough without it. I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts in the cake. It added a nice texture. Next time I'd suggest upping the butter to 1/4 cup and/or using whole milk or light cream in both parts of the cake.",
