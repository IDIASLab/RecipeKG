Beat your cream cheese with the paddle attachment first until it is creamy, then add your sugar, beat for another 3-4 minutes stopping to scrap the bowl, then add the zests, vanilla, beat for a few more minutes and after each egg just until it is combined.  This came out excellent, creamy, great consistency and great flavor.  I think the flavor will largely vary depending on your lemon and lime.  I use organic lemon and limes and I find they have a deeper, more intense flavor.",

Most people enjoyed it. To help avoid an unsightly crack, I placed a dish of boiling water in the oven next to the cheesecake, and I didn't overbake it - this did help. I used a lot more zest and juice than the recipe called for - I think you have to - very bland otherwise. Also, I would add a drop or two of yellow food colouring. It did not come out as yellow as the picture shows.",
