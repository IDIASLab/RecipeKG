When the carrots were to my liking I scooped them into the vinegar mixture and let that set for 1 hour.  I then put into 2 1-pint jars and will refrigerate.  I did also add some salt as I think it needs that.  YUMMMO!!",

I had only had the pickled peppers in restaurants, and these are so much better. To the vinegar and sugar, I added several shakes of ground pepper, around 1/4 tsp of Italian seasoning, and a few shakes of salt. I boiled my carrots for around five minutes before adding the peppers (quartered lengthwise into strips, with the membrane and seeds removed). I also added three cloves of garlic, quartered, and maybe 1/4 cup of sliced white onion. I only boiled everything together for a couple minutes, and then I let it all cool in the pot. When at room temperature, into a glass jar! So good, next time I want to add some cauliflower! Don't be scared of making pickled anything. The reward is worth the effort! Thanks for sharing, JC!",
