Oh and I also added nuts to give it texture and flavor! My English teacher from high school would be so disappointed with the sentence structure here!!!!!! Lol!! I am going to leave out about 1/4 of white sugar the next time I make these by the way!;) Made these for my mother the way I like them. Not enough sugar for her. So I made them per recipe with nuts and flax seed added. She loved them!",

I even used cupcake liners and my pans were still a nightmare to clean. Overall: disappointed and would not make these again. My kids would not eat them.",

I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown a little more cinnamon and a little more vanilla and used Almond Milk (amazing) Next time I make I will definitely use a splash more milk reduce the sugar a little more more cinnamon and more vanilla and cook for a little less time. My oven runs hot. Would recommend these. a great snack in the middle of the day to keep you going calories for me were 96 per muffin could reduce this more with some more tweaking of the recipes. Highly recommend thank you for sharing.",
