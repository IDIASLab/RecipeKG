I had purchased a beehive cookie cutter for an event and wanted to use a honey-based recipe for the cookies I'd cut with it. \nI did have to roll them a little thicker than one might normally due to the depth of the detail on the cutter, which resulted in a smaller yield/number of cookies and the need to bake them a bit longer, but they came out beautifully and I got many compliments on them from those I shared them with.",
