He used Hidden Valley Ranch. He skipped the avocado because he hates it. And he without any deliberation chose to exclude the crumbled blue cheese because you got it he hates it. He has no idea what he was missing. Who wants a salad that s just all right? First right off the bat I made my own blue cheese dressing rather than using some inferior bottled stuff. I made a small batch of Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing Ever! also on AR and it was so good it probably would have made ANY green salad better. I used a creamy Gorgonzola an Italian blue cheese. I used red-ripe Roma (plum) tomatoes and a good amount of bacon which of course remember more is always better. As for the chicken I didn t bother to grill it when I had perfectly cooked rotisserie chicken breast to slice up. A simple and simply delicious salad easy to throw together particularly if you make a good blue cheese dressing ahead of time and take the short cut of a rotisserie chicken.",

I did up the amount of bacon - who doesn't love bacon right? And I added an additional hard boiled egg. Like others I opted to make my own blue cheese dressing and my favorite by far is \"Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese dressing\" from this site and the title is very fitting. Since my husband is a die hard ranch dressing fan I opted to use \"Chef John's Ranch Dressing\" - also from this site. This made for a great throw together weeknight meal that turned out fabulous. Great served with warm crusty bread.",
