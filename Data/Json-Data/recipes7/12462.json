Added a small amount of buttermilk for more robust flavor, Added some cream corn for adding moisture and bits of corn (not gluten free), and a pinch or two of baking soda to give the outside more crispness. It was great!  What I plan to change in the future is to incorporate colby or sharp cheddar for flavor and color enrichment and switch exclusively to buttermilk.  Really good versatile cornbread.",
