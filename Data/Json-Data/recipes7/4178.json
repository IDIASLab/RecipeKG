I ended up adding 2 more eggs to even it out. I don't think it needed the sugar as to me syrup is plenty of sugar. I did however end up adding 1 TBS of the sugar just for the sake of the recipe and that was plenty (although I'm not someone who likes overly sweet stuff). It would be find without the sugar altogether. I did however LOVE the idea of cooking the french toast in the waffle iron!! I thought that was the neatest idea and it made it a bit fun to eat as well. The only complaint I had was that the crust tended to get very tough and chewy. I would suggest cutting off the very outer of the crust before cooking it. Although that might have had something to do with the fact that I used wheat bread instead of white. Either way I did enjoy the recipe and will definitely be making it again.:)",

I don't know about you but mine really tends to get cranky and likes to hang on to most anything I put on it so really be liberal with your Pam. I used about half of a can of fat free evaporated milk I had leftover from yesterday and I did not add the sugar as it wasn't needed.

I only made 2 slices so used 1 egg eye balled the milk and added 1 teaspoon of sugar couple shakes of cinnamon and smidge of vanilla....lovely... Unlike making french toast I don't have to stand over the stove flipping it over and watching it I love this idea!!!",
