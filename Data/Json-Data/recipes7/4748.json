Also one thing we usually do with our monkey bread is after removing the pan from the oven let it cool about 5 minutes and then run a knife around the edges of each muffin cup to loosen them then flip the tray upside down on a baking sheet and let it set a minute for the gooey-cinnamon topping to go down on the top of the muffins.

I love almost anything with cinnamon and sugar so these are right up my alley. These should be a HUGE hit with anyone who likes cinnamon rolls. I can totally see myself making these in the future and drizzling a vanilla glaze over them when serving. The issues I had were that I couldn't find 7.5oz packages of biscuits so I bought 1 package of 16.4oz biscuits. Since it was a little bit larger amount I made 9 portions. But the biscuits were Pillsbury Grands which I think filled the muffin tins a bit too full. The biscuits definitely should be regular size NOT Grands because I poured the butter mixture over the biscuit pieces and while baking some of the sauce bubbled out and into the oven (and I still had a bit of the sauce left over that wouldn't fit in the pans.)",

I think a lot of people missed that and got burnt results because they only used 5 pieces. I used 10 pieces in each and it seemed just a bit too much. I highly suggest making 10 muffins with 8 pieces. As others have mentioned the sugar-cinnamon mixture is way too much and there's a lot left over. Half it at least. I cooked it at 400 degrees but started to get nervous and turned it down to 350 degrees for the last 8 minutes. They didn't burn and were a great success. They did bubble over in the oven though and they were a bit too big but they were loved by all. I might try mixing in other things in the future - orange peel craisins pecans maybe chocolate chips...",
