It's perfectly decadent without feeling like you've just triggered an onset of diabetes. I like it for group dinners for 5 reasons: 1 - the recipe itself is made for more than two people I'd eat them all myself if I didn't have company. 2. There is a certain vibe of fancy when you hand out individual ramekins at the end of dinner 3. it is served cold therefore you can make them ahead of time put them in the fridge and not give them another thought until everyone is ready for dessert. if you're hosting this is super helpful. I make mine the morning of a dinner 4. Easy clean up. take up everyone's ramekins and you're done 5. Recipe calls for cheap and common ingredients. I've made this for a party of 8 with 6 oz servings in 8 oz ramekins. I just added half of the recipe to the original recipe. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't have a problem. Key Tip: Keep an eye on your sugar at the very beginning. I've burned mine more than once cause I get distracted and have to start over. I like to measure out my ingredients ahead of time so when you hit go time you're ready. I bake mine the full hour.",

When cooking I decided to use just sea salt for the entire dish and skipped over the kosher salt. I also used small round Pyrex dishes on top of a baking sheet and it turned out perfectly fine. I would highly recommend this also it's fun showing your family or kids how Carmel is made. It is something so simple that not everyone actually knows.",

I ve made it in a casserole dish and in separate individual servings using small canning jars (since I don t have ramekins). Turns out great every time. I resist making it more often because of the 9 egg yolks and having to use almost a dozen eggs. But for special occasions or company totally worth it. Contrary to his advice of not straining it I DO strain it. There is usually some globs of egg and caramel pieces. I want silky smooth texture and spraying out a strainer is not a strain. Ha!",
