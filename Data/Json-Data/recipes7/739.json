It goes well with just about anything from fried fish to hamburgers, and is to die for on a pulled pork sandwich. If you are going to use it with Q, reduce the amount of dressing you add to the cabbage so it's not too sloppy. For best results refrigerate over night to allow flavors to marry.",

Just want to note that I substituted the dill pickle and pickle juice for sweet relish--just a personal preference. Also, I have made this many, many times and now I add only a medium onion per head of cabbage. I was being told that the onion flavor was a bit overpowering, so I have cut it back considerably. It's also worth mentioning to experiment with different types of mustard.  I have used sweet and spicy and dijons, all with great results. The sugar balances it out nicely. Thank you very much for this recipe!",

I cheated w/ a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix (green & purple cabbage w/ carrots). Not being sure about the equivalency of a head of cabbage to a 16 ounce bag I stuck with the amount of ingredients per the recipe since it would be easy to drain away any excess liquid. In subsequently looking up info it appears an average size head of cabbage produces about 8-10 cups or roughly 32 ounces. When making again I ll halve the mayo & buttermilk unless 2 16 oz. bags are used. One modification was to garnish this dish w/ blue cheese reduced fat crumbles. This was served as an optional topping on Shredded Chicken Tacos by Goya. ROXY24 thanks for sharing.",

In all fairness I tasted again 24 hours later and the flavor didn't taste any different than at 4 hours. For our family there was too much dressing and it was soupy (even after being in the fridge overnight). I do feel this would be good on a pulled pork sandwich because it does not have an overpowering sweet or sour taste.",
