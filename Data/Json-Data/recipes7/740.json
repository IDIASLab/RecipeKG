Next time instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg I might try pumpkin pie spice to see what that tastes like....",

If you have ever had a Vanilla cr\u00e9me from Starbucks you will love this because you can control how sweet it is or isn't.",

Changes I made: I only put in 1/2 tsp cinnamon so I could taste the vanilla more. About the \"slimey cinnamon\"- I didn't encounter that problem. I mixed the cinnamon and sugar in the bottom of the mug first then used the vanilla to dissolve it. Add the milk last. When you take it of the microwave stir vigoursly (sp?) and it's fine.

Next time I will soak a cinnamon stick in it to get the flavor. Try this..add a touch of cream to the milk and use a milk frother to make it nice and creamy! YUM! I just use my cappuccino maker. It has a separate compartment to put your milk in and it froths it as it pours into your cup. Add some spiced rum for a kick! Or my personal favorite amaretto!",
