Maybe my blender is crappy but there just wasn't enough liquid to get it to crush up the ice. I had to let my sorbet melt to the point it was way too runny and then I had to re-freeze it to get it to that slushy consistency. This has potential and one I plan to tinker with. And when I say tinker I mean that I might put in a couple of shots of vodka to get it to that right consistency. Adult strawberry-lime slushie.....BONUS!",
