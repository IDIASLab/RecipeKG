We didn't have kidney beans so I used garbanzo beans instead. I only gave it four stars because of this. The vinaigrette with the olive oil seemed strange to me but I was glad I followed the recipe because it was great! Simple and easy to make for a quick lunch since I had leftover cooked lentils. Definitely making this again!!",

I don't know what balsamic vinaigrette is so I just used balsamic vinegar. I will leave out the sugar the next time. Make sure the lentils are al dente to achieve a nice balance of texture as well as flavour. I used French Green Puy lentils but imagine that brown lentils would work just as well here making it even cheaper lentil salad.:-)Thank you kelly for your recipe.",
