My package said to cook for five minutes, so I followed the package instead of the recipe. They are more like a glass noodle than starchy rice versions. I didn't follow step 3, I  just saut\u00e9ed everything together instead of each single ingredient separately. I added a bit of rice vinegar to the sauce but it is good as written. I added hot peppers and bok choy to the saut\u00e9. Thank you for the recipe.",
