This is 4 relatively small servings of soup not the huge bowls that many soup recipes call a serving. I used my immersion blender to puree it rather than the regular blender which is so much easier. Next time I might add some herbs thyme and parsley perhaps and maybe a bit of lime right into the soup. Thanks",
