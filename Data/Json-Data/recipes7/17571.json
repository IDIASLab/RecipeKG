I searched for a recipe that uses Arborio rice for its starchiness and found this one, and wow, I am blown away. Yes, it\u2019s still rice pudding with a basic rice pudding flavor profile, but the texture is so creamy and lush and it\u2019s just absolutely perfect. I did make two (maybe 3?)  small modifications. I used vanilla bean paste and incorporated with the eggs since the flavor of extracts is bear preserved when added toward the end of cooking, and I waited till the pudding had cooled to room temp before folding in the cream. \n\nThis makes a huge batch and be sure to use an appropriately large pot\u2014rice and milk are both wont to boil over.",

(Kozy Shack could probably retire on my money alone  I was giving this one more try and found this recipe, had arborio rice in the cabinet and voila- sucess!!. I followed recipe with one change and that was adding vanilla when I added the egg mixture. I do have one question and that is why the heavy cream  The consistency was beautiful before I even added it , and why do you whip it before adding it which kind of defeats the purpose of whipping it sent it falls when you add it to the warm-ish pudding.  I think the next time and there WILL b a next time- I will leave the cream out. Si glad I found this recipe! I'm eating the whole thing by myself and not sharing one spoonful!",
