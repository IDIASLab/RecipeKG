Browned the beef/pork combo, drained the oil, added the milk and simmered until the milk was incorporated. (I felt this was an important step as I've never seen it in any other recipe!) I then added the meat and rest of the ingredients (except the cheese) plus a few shakes of garlic powder to the crockpot. Cooked on low for 7 hours, turned the temperature down to Warm and stirred in the cheese. This was definately worth the prep time. Hubby kept eating the sauce like chili (sans pasta) and asked me to put the rest in the freezer so he wouldn't OD on it....lol",

Even though this recipe is slightly different, the one thing the chef said was how important is is to cook the carrot and onions separately, then adding the meat and cooking thoroughly for the right flavoring. So I followed the recipe's instructions to a tee and cooked the time specified. I thought this would taste just like regular spaghetti sauce, but it had a distinct rich meaty flavor. Everyone raved about it...lots of yum yums being murmured.  I served it over wide egg noodles to hold the heavy sauce better. For certain I'll make this one again.",

I hesitated to give this a try, mainly because it really isn't authentic at all (but the slow cooker convenience appealed to me...). True bolognese is made with a mixture of beef, veal AND pork. Celery is also typically added although not necessary (it just adds another level of flavor). Served over spinach fettuccine (ironically, the one thing my hubs didn't care for), this was just \"OK.\" I much prefer my slow cooker meaty spaghetti sauce recipe and will stick with that from now on. Thanks anyways, VD711. :-)",
