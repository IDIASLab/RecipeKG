Grandpa passed away 4 years ago, and was too frail to make them for at least a few years before that. So, it's been a long time since I have eaten one. I knew the ingredients, but didn't know the ratios. Thank you so much for posting this. I did double the cardamom and cinnamon, and added a dash of ginger and cloves. I am giving this recipe a 4 because it's missing two vital ingredients to traditional Danish Pebber Nodder, which I just played with until I felt the taste was just right. It was roughly 1/2 tsp of mace, and 1/4 tsp of white pepper. I made these for my annual cookie exchange. They were so good to snack on and they made perfect neighbor gifts put into small mason jars with pretty ribbon and a homemade tag. Thank you for giving me back an old family tradition, and giving me a fond way of remembering my grandfather.",

I rolled mine in about 1/2 inch balls rolled them in granulated sugar and baked for 10 mins. These are wonderful with coffee or hot tea. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla simply because I add vanilla to all cookie and cake recipes I think will benefit from it. These were awesome!!!!! My husband smelled the cardamom also and wrinkled his nose up. He's a real cookie fan and eats cookies and milk every night before bed. After they finished he couldn't keep his hands off. A great benefit from baking these cookies?????? The house smells wonderful!!!!!!!",

I tried rolling and cutting as directed but found that just rolling into little balls made them look more presentable. Although judging from their disappearance presentation had little effect on the family. For Christmas I think I'd roll them in raw sugar to make them a bit \"prettier\" - and maybe try rolling and twisting a few into a \"pretzel\" shape then dip into sugar. Maybe even add a tsp. (or less) of black pepper for a spicier cookie and roll into powdered sugar after baking. The dough seems like it'd be versatile enough to do that. The best part of the cookies I think is the crispy little bottoms that make them so chewy. I think we'll have to use this recipe more often than for Christmas. (Since we're at high altitude I also added a bit extra flour...)",

To get the real flavor of this traditional cookie you must add white pepper and ginger. As a child I made these every year with my mom and we never went through the trouble of rolling we simply plugged little pieces of the dough and rolled them into balls in our hands. Much more fun and the whole family can participate.",
