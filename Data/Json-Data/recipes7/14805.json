I followed it as written and it came out too buttery and soft to be proper cookie dough so I had to add 1 Tablespoon of flour  but then it tasted too bland so I added  1 Tablespoon of brown sugar. The baking soda isn't really necessary and you can opt to leave it out since the cookie dough isn't being baked. I did make this recipe following the recipe as written but felt it needed adjustments or you can choose to cut the butter in half and the texture should work out fine. I rolled the dough in wax paper and placed in the freezer so I can slice it for ice cream!",
