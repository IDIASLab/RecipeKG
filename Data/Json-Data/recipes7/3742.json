When it says to have a hard boil make sure that the entire surface of the liquid is bubbling like crazy.  I was a little apprehensive about pouring the whole hot mixture over the gelatin at once (I've only seen \"stream in the syrup a little at a time...\"), but it worked.  Set your timer for 6 minutes and check the marshmallows in the mixture then, my marshmallows were done in 8 minutes.  Let it set before you try it, otherwise it tastes like too much gelatin - trust me.  Great recipe, especially since one of my boys have an egg allergy. Thanks for the great recipe.",

Like others mentioned I only used 1tsp. of peppermint extract and they taste wonderful. Also some helpful information \"beating the mixture to fluffy and stiff peaks\" it never happened...I have a kitchen Aid mixer and set the timer for 12min. all I got out of the deal was marshmallow cream so I kept on mixing and mixing. I never got stiff peaks however when I decided to move forward anyway and followed the directions to the \"T\" they came out beautiful!! So easy to make but don't stress out if you don't get stiff peaks. You can flavor these with any flavor you want so easy and perfect texture. Thank you for the great recipe!!",
