I don t like things too sweet so I did cut the sugar in half which worked fine for us (keep in mind you always can add more if needed). Melons flavor and sweetness vary greatly throughout the year and I think the success of this drink is dependent upon the melon itself. Most likely will be best when cantaloupes are in season. My husband wasn't crazy about this but I thought it tasted pretty darn good particularly considering it's February.",
