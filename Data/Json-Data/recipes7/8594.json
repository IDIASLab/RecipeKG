I completely ignored the dairy-free ingredients because I didn't have them and I wanted to use up some flavored coffee creamer I had. I used real butter and International Delight Almond Joy coffee creamer. Because the creamer is so sweet I did not sprinkle sugar on top of the scones before baking. I also made them into squares and cut 9 of them. They turned out pretty sweet but perfect for an evening dessert with a cup of coffee. I would make these again perhaps with a different flavor creamer even and cut them smaller next time.",
