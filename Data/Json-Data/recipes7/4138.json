Low and slow.\n\nThere might not be enough fat in the milf; skim milk will curdle much more easily than other fattier dairy products.\n\nDairy will curdle with the addition of acid and why combining the lemon zest and vodka in an airtight container should help reduce the acid and why it needs to sit in a cool, dark space, shaking the container to redistribute the lemon zest.\n\nYou can temper the milk by whisking a bit of the lemon vodka ingredients into the dairy, then slowly whisking that mixture back into the pan.\n\nMaybe that will help.",
