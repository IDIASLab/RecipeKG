        "description": "This is a large-batch hearty vegetarian salad with the bold flavors of Mexican chorizo sausage (without the meat). It's filling but low in calories. It's smoky, peppery, with bright acidity, and best of all, it has a satisfying crunch that doesn't wilt. It's great for parties since everything is chopped or diced, so it's not awkward to eat, and the crunch will last all day. You can even prepare it the night before with out worrying about a weak wilted salad.",

I chose to leave my mushrooms and radishes whole. Partly for presentation but mostly because I was tired of chopping for so long. The oil needs doubled if you want the mixture to coat all of the veggies but other than this is perfect as written.",
