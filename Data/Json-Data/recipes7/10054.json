I mashed the squash only with a fork and then drained the excess liquid.  To that I added the sour cream, cinnamon, butter, S&P and mixed.  This eliminated the problem others have mentioned.  I did omit the brown sugar because I wanted a savory dish, not sweet.  I have to admit I was skeptical about adding the sour cream but it does work.",

I used plain Yogurt instead of sour cream which I cut down the amount on slightly...added til I was satisfied like another reviewer recommended. Also it doesnt need there sugar if you don't want it. Delicious without. Oh and I also cut down the amount of butter I used. Just to make it healthier overall. Good recipe - thanks for sharing!",
