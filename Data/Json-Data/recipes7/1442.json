I confirm that it was inedibly burned on the outside edge and raw in the middle.  Started again with another half a recipe. I thought smaller cookies might be better so I pressed 1/4 cup of dough onto waxed paper in a 4\" metal egg muffin ring. Removed the ring and waxed paper and placed the dough circle onto the greased pan. 5 circles in a round pizza pan for 15 minutes yielded 5 barely edible burned-on-the-edges cookie triangles that needed to be pulled apart.   Next, reduced heat to 350 and only 10 minutes baking and only 4 cookies on sheet. Eureka! Success at last.  The best was only 3 cookies at a time on the sheet and then the cookies did not touch at all. Each cookie spread to 5 1/2\".  The dough is basically a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Again, I apologize, but this isn't the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. Now granted, I didn't have butterscotch chips, and that would have made a difference to the taste.   Made my own cookie dough recipe, omitting chocolate chips and adding 2 Tbsp cocoa (could have doubled cocoa). Plopped the dough into the metal ring and baked like that. Made 14 thick, 4\" cookies that make awesome ice cream sandwiches!",
