Things I did different: I used fresh cherries instead of canned. I had a whole bag of cherries that my husband and I didnt touch-and I just couldnt throw them away. So I kept searching and searching until I came across this recipe. And I have to admit I was a little scared. I kept going back and forth and debating if I was brave enough to make it. And well I was lol. I really am shocked at how much I love this little dessert. I wasnt sure if my husband will like it but I'm about to take his dinner to his work (he works late tonight) and we'll see what he has to say. All I have to say is baby and I are really enjoying it! (4 months pregnant) If you are looking at this recipe thinking there is too much work involved I promise you-there isnt. And try something new I did and look I love it! Im a fan. xoxo happy eating!",

The crust is very floury tasting and the topping really isn't a topping at all it just settles into the custard and sort of disappears. There isn't much cherry flavor the dominating flavor being the floury tasting crust. I'm afraid this was not a hit at all.",

The crust is more crispy (in a good way) than usual pie crust. (Yes I know it's not a pie but I thought the crust would be pie-like.:D) The topping was a good ratio but I don't think it's needed.
