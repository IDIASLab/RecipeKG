I paired the tuna with boiled baby red potatoes and green beans the dill sauce was a perfect compliment. I am using the left over sauce on a salmon fillet tomorrow evening. I have added this recipe to my stand by cookbook so that I can reference it at a moments notice. Thanks for the great new staple!",
