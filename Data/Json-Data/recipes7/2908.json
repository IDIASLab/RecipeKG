For those of you who may be thinking \"Mayonnaise! What???\" do not fear, there is no residual mayonnaise taste in these muffins whatsoever. If you think about it, mayo is really just egg whites and vinegar, which often appear together in cake recipes. And these are very cake-y indeed. Even my banana-phobic brother in law couldn't get enough of these. Also, to the reviewer who found the recipe not liquid-y enough, something must have gone horribly wrong. You do have to make sure that you choose bananas that are past their prime, they'll break down into liquid and sugar better/faster. Also, the mayo makes this recipe a little more \"sticky\" than the typical quickbread batter. Just go with it, you won't be sorry.",

I didn't realize the recipe was backward until after I had already went on autopilot and done it the way I usually do, adding dry to wet ingredients. I have also made these with just under a cup of pumpkin puree instead of the bananas, adding a bit of pumpkin pie spice, and it was still wonderful! Great recipe.",

I think next time I'll sub quinoa flour for the all-purpose to give it a more nutty-earthy flavor and perhaps add some walnuts.",
