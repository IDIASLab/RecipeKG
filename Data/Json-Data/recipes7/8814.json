Another plus is you'll nearly always have the ingredients on hand.",

They're light and milk chocolaty, which Hubs loved but I found a little wimpy in chocolate intensity, and I did boost the flavor with a pinch of salt.  Otherwise, nicely shaped, with rounded tops.  Great as is, perfection (in Hubs' opinion) with the buttercream frosting I dressed them up with.  (I gave the frosting a bit of almond flavor, but mint would be awesome good too!)",

I made it exactly as written with the butter being unsalted and the chocolate chips being semi-sweet. They turned out to be just like the title brownies in a cupcake form. For brownies they were a little on the basic side though so I won't give this a full 5-stars but I managed to eat all 18 cupcakes in about 8 days and I liked them all. I'm thinking that maybe I should make these again share them and see what my friends think.",
