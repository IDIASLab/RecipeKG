I was making individual pineapple upside-down cakes and wanted a cherry sauce to drizzle over them. I used this recipe substituting black cherries for the ground cherries. I also allowed it to reduced down to a beautiful thick sauce. The black cherries I used were run through the food processor to a nice small chunked size. It was a beautiful presentation and the spices in this recipe were the perfect compliment to the pineapple and sweetness of the cakes. Wonderful!Thank you for giving me a great start to a wonderful sauce.",

I used half frozen dark sweet cherries and half frozen cranberries (finely chopped in a blender) and then added some chopped fresh raspberries to the finished product. I also used 1/2 cup lemon juice and half a cup of water to make it a little more tangy. The spices are amazing with my version as well and it made the perfect topping for vanilla ice cream... highly recommended!",

Two changes: I crushed the cherries in the saucepan so the pulp would simmer into the other ingredients. I also divided the sauce to use half for basting and half for spooning over the finished meat. Otherwise no changes. Everybody raved.",
