It has almost a cake-like texture; VERY soft and fluffy and the flavor of the nutmeg comes out beautifully (I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract) with a perfect hint of sweet potato goodness. Fresh out of the oven it didn't seem to have too much flavor although the texture was lovely. I waited for it to set for a while and about four hours later it was perfect. I've eaten five already and made a batch of thirty. By their quality I'd say they'll be gone the second my apartmentmates wake up tomorrow; _ Unexpectedly excellent recipe: Bravo!",

And I ended up baking the cookies for about 10 minutes. I would definitely make this recipe again - the lemon zest added a nice kick. I baked them last night left them overnight to cool and tried them this morning - absolutely delicious and healthier than many other cookie recipes!",

One lemon will give roughly enough zest for a double recipe. I also added some cinnamon to the recipe.",

They are very pretty with specks of orange and green and they are not too sweet so they'll go well with a ham dinner. Not what I expected but interesting just the same. Also my 2 year old likes them even though there are veggies in them!! Thank you!",

The reviewers said it was like a biscuit so I cut back to 1 tsp of baking powder and increased to 2 eggs. That made the cookies more like little puffy cakes. I like the glaze idea also but they are also good without glaze. Next time I will roll the ball of batter before spooning it onto the baking pan to get a rounder finished shape in the cookie. I would also try them with already-baked and sweetened chunks of sweet potato in the batter in place of or in addition to the shreds of raw sweet potato. Overall I great cookie!",

Turned out like little scone-cookies. My husband took them to work where they were apparently gobbled up by his Japanese co-workers. Would definately make again perhaps experiment more with different flavour additions.",
