                "reviewBody": "This is a very good way to cook green beans. However, I do have a couple suggestions based upon the way I make them myself. For anyone who hasn't ever had beans cooked in this, or a similar type manner, I would first suggest that you begin with ONLY  a TEASPOON of sugar, and increase the amount of sugar based upon your own family's personal taste. Like some other reveiwers have mentioned, another really good addition is a bit of diced onion. One final addition that really seems to tie all of this together & really takes this dish 'over the top' is to add a splash or so of some apple cider vinegar. Again, the amount that you add should be done to taste & based upon the taste preferences of your own family. Don't worry, a splash or two of vinegar will NOT make your beans taste vinegary in the least, it only enhances & ties together all of the other flavors in your dish & makes it a much more vibrant & flavorful way of cooking traditional green beans. (Even if you do end up making a mistake and add too much vinegar for your taste you can always cut any sharpness by adding just a bit more sugar. Another way is to just increase your cooking time a little bit more. By doing that, you'll 'cook off' any of the unwanted excess vinegar, and your dish will 'mellow' itself right back out. Plus you'll get the added benefit of your beans becoming even more tender for you with any entended cooking time you might add.) Hope this helps!",

THEN I add the sugar--Brown Sugar! I let it cook and caramelize a bit, then I add the green beans, partially drained and the bacon that I've crumbled. I like it in still fairly large pieces. \nReally...these are awesome, and I make them very very often. My husband and I struggled to eat a jar before...often I would throw half out. Now, we eat it ALL!",
