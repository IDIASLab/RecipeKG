I started the sauce in the afternoon and left it covered on low then cooked the chicken a half hour before guests arrived and popped it in the oven. All I had to do was serve a prepped salad and cook the pasta! It was well received and was asked for the recipe (well being another AR Member she could find it! Lol!). I Used Italian diced tomatoes cutting back on the spices. I added more of all the veggies and used just a half a giant Vidalia. Perhaps because it simmered a while I used a lot more red wine and added some chicken broth as well. Easily adjusted as needed. Could have been because I used the diced instead of plum but the sauce tasted just a touch bitter to me so I added a half teaspoon of baking soda to cut the acidity. Loved it and I look forward to making this again! Thanks Pam!",

                "reviewBody": "Great flavors! This dish has the consistency of a traditional Cacciatore so it doesn't thicken up like a marinara (and we like that). The big change that we made was to add seasoning. First of all the chicken must be seasoned appropriately (either the meat or the breading). Plus the sauce needs more salt for the volume. That addition was enough to really bring out the flavors of the veggies and the meat... yum!",

                "reviewBody": "Not that I made it, I'm sure it tastes OK. It's just that this recipe is not at all the way Italians prepare this dish. The chicken is not boneless and skinless. It is dredged in flour and browned, then cooked as a fricassee. While their are many permutations of this dish among Italian chefs, baking is not a variation. Neither is using boneless and skinless chicken. Dry white wine is what is most commonly used. Celery, carrots, garlic and onion are the vegetables used in the tomato sauce. Sometimes a cored and seeded bell pepper is cut into julienne strips, always red or yellow pepper, never a green one. This dish often is made a generous amount of ground black pepper from the mill. The variants I have noticed while conversing with other Italian chefs, is whether or not to add basil or marjoram. Most recipes do not call for a green herb to be added, and when it does I guarantee you that it's not oregano. Believe it or not vegetable oil is used for the traditional recipe. This is a bastardized version of the recipe and not really authentic Italian cooking. To learn how to fricassee chicken, try Marcella Hazan's \"Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking\".",
