I used brown sugar in place of the white which underscored the peanut butter flavor even better added the chopped peanut butter cups at the end of the freezing and folded them in gently. This made them stay much chunkier. Also I swirled in some chocolate syrup in at the end just for additional chocolate flavor. We felt these measures made an already-great recipe even more decadent. Any way you choose to do it however this ice cream is extraordinary. Outrageously smooth with a velvety creaminess even when frozen for hours. Easy to scoop too. Maybe it's all the egg yolks. Maybe it's the peanut butter. Who knows? Who CARES? I make all the ice cream that comes into this house have been making sorbets gelato and ice cream for decades and it's no exaggeration to say that this recipe is a major standout.",
