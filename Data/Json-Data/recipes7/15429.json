(This allows for a little bump at the edges for a crust)\nWhen pushing out the dough, use cornmeal not flour.\nPreheat a cast-iron skillet in oven if you don't have a baking stone.\nOil skillet before adding dough, and build the pizza in the skillet.\nDrop the temp to 400-425F an cook for 15 minutes.",
