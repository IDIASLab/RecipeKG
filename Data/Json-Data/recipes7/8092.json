I would reduce to a tsp or totally eliminate sugar  in the future to suit our tastes.  Definitely made a vibrant and refreshing drink, so thanks Nolimit for posting your recipe.",

We also omitted the salt because we wanted to keep it low sodium, used low sodium tomato juice, and we blended about 1/4 C. real onion and one very large clove of garlic in place of the powders. It was fantastic but because of all the changes we made I gave it 4 stars. My favorite thing about the recipe is there was NO CELERY!! This is our new favorite recipe for this mix for sure.",

For my guests who wanted more spice we just added it to their glass.",
