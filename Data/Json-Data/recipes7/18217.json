I did have some issues with the baking times though--mine took 10-15 minutes longer to dry out in the oven on the second bake. And I wouldn't bake them until browned but rather dried out. And I also don't think it's necessary to use just 7 egg whites. I think 3 eggs plus an egg yolk in the recipe and then saving the egg white to brush on top would work just fine. Then you wouldn't need to find something to do with 7 egg yolks! I think these would taste great dipped in chocolate--just to gild the lily a bit! I got 36 biscotti out of this too. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
