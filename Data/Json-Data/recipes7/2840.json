I have to admit I did tweak it a bit as I didn't not want the cinnamon to overpower the taste of the yams - I only boiled them with 1 teaspoon and put only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the glaze. Next time I will do one or the other but not both - even that was a bit too much cinnamon for my personal tastes. But once that bacon hits your tastebuds - life as you know it has changed forever! I wanted to hold back on the cayenne but used the full amount and am SO glad I did. My daughter is right - this is (so cliche ) to die for. Fabulous recipe and now I intend to go look for more by the same contributer!! THANKS!!",

                "reviewBody": "This one I cant recommend as written. There needs to be some changes made in the way it's prepared I ended up with a big mess that doesnt work the way the recipe describes. Even if it did I cant imagine it being used as an appetizer with toothpicks. All that being said the flavors are wonderful together.. just wish the recipe had been better put together. I would completely change how the bacon and the \"sauce\" is prepared; as written the bacon takes at least twice as long to crisp with that much sugar DONT use paper towels when you drain the bacon unless you like the taste of paper in your food because it's impossible to remove sugar coated bacon from paper towels. The sauce/topping was the worst because it ends up carmelizing into a thick ooze that wont pour over anything while you're trying to crisp the bacon and hardens into cement when it cools. I ended up mixing what I could coax out of the pan into the mixture made to coat the potatoes & pineapple. There should also be a clue as to what degree of doneness the sweet potatoes should be after boiling.. I'd probably have cooked them a little less so they didnt turn into almost mush when I combined the ingredients. I ended up baking it at 425 for about 20 minutes. If you're willing to watch out for these issues and dont mind all the dirty dishes you're going to make go ahead and give it a shot as the flavors are lovely together.",
