This is usually the meal, but it may also be an appetizer salad as well. I offered it as both in my restaurants. The dressing and pecans keep for a few weeks unrefrigerated, and I often make these in bulk in advance for several meals. A simple dish, easily made by any level cook, it is a stylish, beautiful, and delectable entree salad fit for company.",

It looks like there are a lot of steps, but you can be doing more than one step at the same time.  I was a little concerned about the marinade ingredients not being enough to marinade 4 steaks, so I added an extra tablespoon of EVOO & porto, which was a good call. I also didn't have any radishes on hand, so I used 3 green onions instead.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe to a \"T\".  Just an awesome salad, and one that I won't forget!",
