This was perfect I had corn bread batter and potatoes that needed to be used and this recipe did the job. If you think it might taste/sounds bland then add some extra spices while your cooking your chicken or use chicken brother with your mashed potatoes. I added some onion powder pepper and salt to the chicken. This is a very filling meal but my kids still went back for seconds! I'm glad I made two pans it's just as easy ad making one and it will be nice to not have to cook tonight.",
