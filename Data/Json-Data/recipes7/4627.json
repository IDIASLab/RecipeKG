You definitely have to melt the peanut butter. I did add the optional vanilla extract as I always use that when making french toast. I also added a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. I just eyeballed the ingredients because I've been making french toast for years! Instead of veg. oil I used butter. I never use veg. oil when making french toast. Overall this was very good especially with some sliced bananas a little extra melted peanut butter and some maple syrup on top!",

We did not do so, using the natural peanut butter.  It was difficult to mix the peanut butter with the egg mixture, so our first two pieces had very little pb, but the others were coated.  By the last piece, there were globs of pb coating the toast.  Nothing to complain about if you like pb...Definitely stir batter prior to each dip.   Thanks for the recipe!",
