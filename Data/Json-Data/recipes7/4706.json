I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warmed milk and sugars for ten minutes until it \"bloomed\" added the remaining wet ingredients then all the dry. I kneaded the dough with my hook for about five minutes then set it to rise in a covered greased bowl on my warm oven for about an hour. Once it doubled I formed it into a loaf and let it double again in a covered greased loaf pan on my warm oven. Thirty minutes in a 350 oven and we were good to go. I made myself wait until the next morning and I made french toast with it. OFF THE HOOK. We used the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup over the top of it and it really sang. Super easy bread and way flavorful. Not difficult to make at all. I'd really like to try this with whole wheat flour and see how it is.....maybe even a cinnamon swirl in the middle?",

I only had light brown sugar so I used that instead of dark (though I do want to try it with the dark at some point!). I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. My vanilla extract is a double-strength one but I still used the full 1.5 teaspoons. I had fresh ground coriander from last year's garden so that was really nice. It smelled DIVINE as it was baking! I used bread flour and while it was kneading it seemed a bit on the sticky side so I threw in a little bit of whole wheat flour (probably about 1/8 cup at most). GREAT texture very slightly chewy (in a good way) rose and baked up nicely in the machine. We had it toasted for breakfast this morning. Will definitely be making this again and will try it with dark brown sugar!",

Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and was so happy with the outcome. We had it lightly toasted with a bit of Cinnamon Cocoa Spread from this site and I can't wait to try it as french toast.
