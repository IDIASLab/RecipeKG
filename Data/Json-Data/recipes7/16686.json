But nevertheless weirdly addictive and so good. Very easy to make if you know how to whip up stiff peaks with eggs whites (and not over-beat!) you can make these. I didn't have blocks of chocolate so I used Callebaut chocolate chunks and further cut them up with a knife. It makes for uneven bits of chocolate but in my opinion it makes the cookies even better because sometimes you get a surprise chunk of chocolate when you bite into the cookie. Next time I will add a bit of chili and cinnamon.",
