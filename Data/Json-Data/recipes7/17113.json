Unfortunately it s not a gifting or traveling cookie because Nutella never hardens so you have to lay them out flat or the chocolate will get on the other cookies. I m going to make these again and add hazelnut extract and melting chips to Nutella to see if it will harden the chocolate. Otherwise it s a make and serve cookie not one I can batch bake for the gift giving.",
