I m trying to watch my sugar intake these days so I did substitute Truvia which worked perfectly fine. I did put in the whole cloves but the potent vinegar overpowered that flavor so if you re interested in a subtle clove flavor definitely add more than the recipe indicates. I really didn t leave these in the jar seemed just as easy to put them in a bowl add the vinegar mixture & cloves and put a lid on them. I did add some sliced onions to the mixture after I took the photo which is something that my mother always did. Maybe there is a typo in this recipe but one can of beets will not yield 12 servings??? Pickled beets certainly are not rocket science but these were very good very easy and. perhaps just a little too sweet for my palate (personal taste preference) but I still enjoyed them.",

I added approximately small white onion thinly sliced. after 2 days I couldn't wait, had to try and was not disappointed.   \nI can easily add a couple secret  ingredients for these to taste just like gramma's.",
