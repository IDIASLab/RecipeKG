It formed a very rich chocolate mix to add to the batter. The taste was incredible but the next time I make these waffles I will add some oil to the batter the waffles crumble slightly and I want it all together. As toppings I treated the waffle like it was desert sliced strawberries whipped cream butterscotch topping and chopped pecans. It was for a girls night in and my friends loved them. We all ate too much! They pair well with a nice blush wine!",
