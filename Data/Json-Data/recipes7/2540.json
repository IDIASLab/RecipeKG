I also used two (small) red peppers and two (small) yellow peppers. Next time I will make sure to make it with only red peppers though the yellow peppers taste nice the soup turns out mostly yellow. I also didn t have garlic cloves so I used garlic powder in their stead. I also substituted chilli powder for the cayenne pepper and it doesn t overpower the soup either. Thanks!",
