I filled mine with a sweet coconut mixture to make chinese cocktail buns, very yummy:3 for anyone who is looking to cut down on a bit of work, i experimented and put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle and it rose beautifully! The order i did it in: warm milk, oil(i used canola), eggs, sugar, salt, bread flour, and lastly the yeast (i accidentally added in the 2 tsp of water to the dough that was meant for the egg wash:P it didn't hurt anything).. then i let my bread machine do its thing:) after it was done kneading i let it sit in the machine for about 2 hours. After i filled and placed my rolls on the baking sheet i let them sit in the oven for an hour (for the first 20 mins i put a bowl of boiling water under the bread then took it out and let the rolls sit in the oven for the remaining 40 mins). I used a honey wash for a bit of a sweet glaze:) Turned out sweet, soft, and so so yummy! Thank you for the recipe!!!",

We divide the recipe into 13 and is gives them a nice size for their lunches. I cheat a bit and add all the ingredients into my bread maker. I use instant yeast and mix with a third of the flour. Make sure the milk is quite warm mix in the sugar. Top with dry ingredients make a small hole and pour in the oil egg and water. You might have to add a bit of water while this mixing process my bread machine makes a loud clicking sound. I don't know how many rules I've broken by using the bread maker but it works for me. We will be making this recipe lots. Thanks for sharing.",

Follow this recipe and you'll have great pork (or beef or chicken or veggie) buns too! The only thing I recommend is in step 1 to add the eggs oil and salt BEFORE the flour (or at least at the same time by making a well in the flour) as it is difficult to mix otherwise. I find that two hours is usually plenty for the first rise and for my oven the final baking is usually only 20 minutes. These are so great and wonderfully non-messy to eat. Enjoy!",
