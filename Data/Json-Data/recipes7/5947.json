I recommend to shape your log more into a biscotti shape because the dough does not change its shape too much. Then I would reduce the intial baking time as the bottom was too dark even with parchment paper when cutting into indiv. cookie. The top cracked and sawing was difficult to keep any kind of shape. I would def. lightly chop pistachios the next time. I would try this again just to see if the tweaking made it easier. But I have tried much easier biscotti before.",

I substituted the cinnamon for fresh ground cardamom seeds and the cinnamon chips for butterscotch chips. I also replaced the pistachio with walnuts and afterwards I dipped the biscotti in semi sweet giradelli chocolate and then in more walnuts. I would say that they can out fantastic. The recipe works perfectly. The only downside is that it's much more complicated than most. There are a many more steps it seems for this biscotti than most other biscotti recipes.",
