My recommendations: - grate and chill the butter ahead of time. I think my scones spread out rather than up because the butter wasn't cold enough - cut the raspberries into halves or quarters. The raspberry chunks were a bit too big - bake slightly longer than directed - I think 17 minutes was about right for me",
