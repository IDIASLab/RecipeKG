When substituting applesauce for fat in a recipe I generally use equal parts fat / applesauce. One tip for success when baking with applesauce - beat the eggs and applesauce together then beat that with the fat and then add the sugar. This recipe does not call for salt so if you are using unsalted butter I would suggest adding 1/4 tsp salt.",

In going with my gut instinct I made a few \"tweaks\" that elevated this to a 4-5 star recipe (I liked it hubs loved it). I increased the butter to 1/2 cup and reduced the applesauce to 1/2 cup and add 1 more egg. I beat the eggs in with the applesauce as suggested by Baking Nana and added about 1/4 cup of milk to the batter to thin it out a bit before pouring over the apples/cranberries. With these changes baking time was right around 48 minutes in my oven. I served this with a dollop of whipped cream and it was a moist and delicious cake and one that I'd make again.",

I used 1/2 cup of softened butter & 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also thought my other Motts recipes were a little bland so I added a couple of pinches of salt. I made everything else according to the recipe. It took about 40 minutes for my cake to cook. The cake was ok but we weren't overwhelmed by the flavor. It was a little dry and I think it would taste better and be moister if some chunked apples were added to the batter and not just slices in the bottom of the pan. I probably would not make again.",

My other tweaks were too add 2t of baking powder 1/2t salt 1t vanilla and 1/2cup greek yogurt. I also upped the cinnamon to a full teaspoon and added a teaspoon to the brown sugar and apple mix.
