I suggest mixing the berries sugar etc in a large mixing bowl and mixing well by hand first before placing in the 9\"xs13' baking dish. 4 cups of berries amounts to about 24 ounces of packaged berries and to make three cups of chopped rhubarb you need three large stalks of rhubarb cut into small pieces. I increased the baking time to 45 minutes as I live at 6040 feet in Albuquerque.",
