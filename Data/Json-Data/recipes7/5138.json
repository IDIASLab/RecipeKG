Next time I would add vanilla extract because I thought it was missing a little something.  Also, despite squeezing the moisture from the zucchini, the baking time for me was inadequate and I needed to add about 10-15 minutes more.  With all zucchini breads, I always put parchment paper on the bottom, and grease and flour the bread pan for ease in removing it from the pan.   Overall, a nice bread and an excellent use of zucchini from your garden.",

I dropped my zucchini into the food processor and processed until it was in very small pieces. It was much faster than grating the zucchini.",
