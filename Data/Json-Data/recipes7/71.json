I did not put in the water at all, only a bit less than half a cup of soy milk, and 2 small lemons rather than one normal one. \n\nNOTE, please read!: To all my non-vegan friends, if you make this recipe for your vegan friends and family, DO NOT use normal margarine. It is NOT vegan. Please use 'Earth Balance' which will be in the natural section of your grocery store, or if you cannot find this one where you are, try to find a margarine that says 'lactose free' and read the ingredients to make sure there is no 'whey' or 'casien'.

So use half the liquid but keep all the lemon and lemon juice.. so try to cut down on the water and soy milk.I also found vanilla soy milk added more sweetness to it. remember that on more humid and wet days you will require LESS liquid and on dryer days more liquid. So only add small bits at a time. and once it form a giant ball stop mixing and do what needs to be done to prepare it for cooking. What ever liquid is left toss it same with what ever dry is left in the bowl.",
