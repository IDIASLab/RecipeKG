Whether you're going for a sweet or savory experience, just try this recipe and you'll see I'm not crazy! The first time I ever had something like this, it was piled over crispy rye breadcrumbs and used to garnish salmon gravlax. The combination of tastes, textures, and temperatures truly was incredible. This would also great with buffalo wings and blue cheese sauce.",

This sorbet is probably for foodie tasters and viewers to determine the level of what you can handle on such shows that may be close to the thoughts of weird food combinations involving competitors. In not wanting to waste all that fresh celery. I went for the outside the box celery sorbet, fresh and sweet, and you can, taste the celery. It's celery. I enjoyed, but unless you have adventure eaters as family and friends they may go to the corner store and get some ice cream. \nIn the realm of food culture it is in the high end category of what to with this in the kitchen of creative ideas. I finished it off about a week ago. I had forgotten it in the freezer for a moment. Now, remember sorbet has lots of sugar, which made this a sorbet and flavorful.\n\nTry it  yourself,\nFoodie Kim",

Maybe I got tired of all of the tasty sorbet flavors like mango, orange, and lemon.  Maybe I was trying to eat healthy since celery allegedly has detox properties.  \nWhatever the reason, I made this and it tastes like frozen sugar with a hint of grass.  I kid you not -- this tastes like grass doused with sugar water!\n\nI watched the video and read the reviews before I started.  I did think that there was a hit of sarcasm in Chef John's voice but I chalked it up as my own paranoia.  I now know that I was not wrong -- HE WAS BEING SARCASTIC!!!  I'm not going to tell you not to make this as it is the perfect punishment to give you your 5 year old when they misbehave.  On the other hand, if you're like me and are trying to see if the grass is greener off the beaten path, it is not.  Get back into your lane and stick with the traditional sorbet flavors.\n\nP.S.  If you do try this, at least cut down on the sugar or add more celery.  You'll want that grassy note to overcome the forwardness of the sugar.  Well played, Chef Jon.  You got me good.  LOL.",
