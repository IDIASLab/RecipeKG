The first cake batter the melted butter became chunky when I added the strawberry pur\u00e9e. I threw it out and decided to try again, but this time I warmed the pur\u00e9e to room temperature over warm water before adding it. I finished the batter and cooked the cake. The cake didn\u2019t rise at all! I looked at the dates of my ingredients and they were all in date. I figured I messed up somehow so I made the cake again exactly as the recipe says. This cake didn\u2019t rise at all either. I tasted it and it was bland. I found another strawberry cake recipe on this site and made that instead. It turned out perfect! I will never make this cake again.",
