                "reviewBody": "This recipe doesn't have enough detail to be successful which is probably why only three people (now four) have made it. For example it does not say what size pan to use. Also the amount that the cake expands is alarming but don't fret it will shrink down after cooling. Also in the second layer it does not say how long to whisk the cream marscapone cheese and sugar mixture so this layer can be somewhat dense. Lastly the folding in of the gelatin is very weird because it doesn't feel like it gets mixed well especially if the gelatin starts setting while you're in the mixing stage. The worst part of this recipe is that it is impossible for light cream to whisk until soft peaks form. I whisked it on low medium then high speed for a very long time and the peaks never formed in the last step. Super frustrating!",
