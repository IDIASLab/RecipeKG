Half of the bread slices didn't have enough batter to coat. I liked the coconut. It added a nice flavor. If I were to adjust this recipe and make it again I would suggest using almond milk coconut milk or soymilk. I would use half of a cup instead of a quarter cup. I would use 2-3 eggs or 2-4 egg whites and maybe 3tbs of chia sprinkled on the toast sticks after they are in the pan.",
