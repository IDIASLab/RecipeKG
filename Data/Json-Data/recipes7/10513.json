I got the recipe from \"Winter Fruit Salad with Poppyseed Dressing   \" here on AR. Over the months of making it I did some healthier changes for us. I now use FRESH squeezed lemons (takes time - but worth it) I split the oils between Olive & Canola - half sugar and half Stevia. You would think we'd get sick of eating this - but its the BEST!! In our salad we use: Romaine - spinach - kale - grapes - pumpkin seeds - broccoli - cauliflower - peppers - sometimes onions - for a protein we use chicken....but our latest and new favorite is using \"Red Sockeye Salmon\" from the can. I crave this salad if I go one night without it.....can't get much healthier.",

I used the juice and zest of 1 lemon, then added some cherry pit vinegar to make up the rest ( flavour a bit almondy and sweet, similar to white balsamic, but not quite the same).
