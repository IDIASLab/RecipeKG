                "reviewBody": "This recipe as printed in the magazine differs slightly. The magazine says 3-1/2 cups Rice Chex finely crushed. The recipe on the web site says 3-1/2 cups Chex \"squares\" finely crushed. When I made it from the magazine I wasn't sure which way to do it so I used 3-1/2 cups of the crushed Chex. Obviously way too much. The magazine also says 3 lemons juiced or about 1/2 cup. The web recipe says clearly 1/2 cup of lemon juice. You may or may not get 1/2 cup out of juice from 3 lemons depending on the size of the lemons. I made it in a 9\" pie plate as instructed and I think next time I will use an 8\" just so the filling crowns a little more. The filling is wonderful and I think this crust would make a fabulous sub for graham crackers for any pie especially when baking for someone who has to be gluten free as I was. The ground Chex could have a lot of other uses as a sub for bread crumbs. Kudos to SandyG",

I don't even know how to modify the crust to improve it so I probably won't make it again. Maybe it would make a better flourless dessert to just make it as a pudding. After reading another review I think the recipe wasn't clear about the measurement of the Rice Chex; 3 1/2 cups of crushed squares is very different from 3 1/2 cups of squares crushed.",
