Because of the \"or as needed\" listed with the berries I was leery and added another cup and a half which was perfect (total 6 1/2 cups). I've never used tapioca before so I used 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with the lemon juice and then I cooked the whole thing to thicken it. Once cooled I filled the pie. I omitted the butter and used a whole egg to brush the top (also sprinkled the sugar on right away) I baked it for 50 mins and it was perfect! Delicious. Jul/2016 Today I made this as tarts in muffin tins and it turned out delicious! Just cut large (4\") circles of dough and fit into buttered muffin tins. Didn't bother with a top. Delish!",
