                "reviewBody": "The other reviewer was right the proportions for this were WAY off! however with a few altercations if is FABULOUS!! I used an 8.5x11 inch pan and there's no way 1 cup of blackberries would be enough for even that. I used two medium tubs (12oz apiece) of blackberries which means I also doubled the sugar (it's still early in the season though so my berries were still pretty tart; it needed it) mixed with them. The bottom \"crust\" batter was very thick almost pastelike even though I added about 3/4 cup of milk. It was still delicious though just saying you WILL need more than 1/4 cup of milk. I also like a lot of crumble so I doubled the oats and brown sugar mixture. The bottom dough wasn't even close to done at 30 minutes so I had to put it back in for another 20 minutes. I think next time I'll try it at 375 or maybe even 400 as the top wasn't very crispy either. I shaved a cold stick of butter to lay on top of the crumble. Now that is a lot of altercations but it made a hearty cobbler and the taste was PHENOMENAL! I especially like the addition of oats which makes it more crumbly instead of cakey like some of the other recipes I'd looked at. We ate it with scoops of ice cream. It's pretty rich so I wouldn't serve yourself too much although it's tempting!:) Enjoy! I added a picture since there was none (white bowl with a scoop of ice cream added).",

I liked the tartness of the cranberries but I think blackberries or raspberries probably would be better. However no reason to dock this recipe as a result. I think it was a nice cobbler.
