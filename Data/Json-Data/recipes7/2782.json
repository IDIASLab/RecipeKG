To reduce the \"sharp\" onion taste (if you are concerned about the onions), a little more work is required: start roasting the onions in about 1 teaspoon of oil first in the pot, then, when the onions are light golden brown, add the white sugar and lightly caramelize. Then add the water and the other ingredients as the original recipe calls for. That way, the onions release their full sweetness, while the edge is taken off.  I also think, adding about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of ground coriander would spice it up a bit, but I have not tried that yet myself.",

I almost skipped over it because of the onions and celery but I am so glad I took a chance.The flavor and texture is wonderful. The only things I changed is that I didn't have fresh ginger and had to use powered and instead of water I used orange juice to add a bit more flavor and I love nuts so I threw in 3/4 c. of pecans. I will be making this as long as I can get my hands on fresh cranberries. Thank you for this flavorful chutney.",
