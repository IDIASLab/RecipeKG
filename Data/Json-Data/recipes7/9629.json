And a final thought, 450 for 20-30 minutes is probably a bit much. If you want to bake for 30 minutes, go for 350.",

I fried some strips of bacon and reserved a Tbs. of the fat to saut\u00e9 some diced yellow onion and some chopped spinach. I added the scrambled eggs to the same pan and seasoned with salt and pepper. Remember to slightly undercook your eggs since they will be going into the oven. I mixed some of the shredded cheese into the eggs, along with the crumbled bacon, like a scramble and toped off each stuffed pepper with more before putting in the oven.  I recommend peeling the skin off the pablanos after roasting in the oven. After it blisters it has a bitter flavor and tough texture. All in all a great breakfast recipe that can be easily modified and is really quick and easy. Beautiful presentation too!",

I also cooked the peppers ahead @ 375 for 20 minutes....that was plenty. Otherwise they would be mush! I might even cook them less for a bit more \"bite\".",

When roasting the peppers, only took about 10 minutes at 450 to blister /brown the skin.  20-30 minutes may be excessive but just watch for browning/blistering of skin, then they're done.  My wife and I (she doesn't like very spicy things, and it's not) give this recipe 2 enthusiastic THUMBS UP along with a salsa shake for the flavor!!",
