I made this as directed but I did use a yellow onion because that is all I had. I also added just a touch of butter to the chicken pan to help brown the chicken better. Sparky declared this five stars and wants it on a regular rotation. I concur! Try this....you'll LOVE it! Thanks for sharing Bibi!",
