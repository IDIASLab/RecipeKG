I had no celery, so each time I used chopped leeks, green and white parts. I added minced carrots once. I'm going to try adding white corn just at the end (to avoid overcooking, which toughens corn) next. Twice I used the heavy cream called for, and once I used the standard substitution of 3/4 cup milk, and 1/3 cup of butter, divided in half for 1/2 cup of cream. (Don't worry - you'll be making this soup again very soon, and use up the remaining 1/2 cup of \"cream\"!)Once I used Arborio rice, which is what's used for thick and creamy risotto, which was perfect for this recipe. A bit of cooked chorizo sausage on top might be tasty when serving, or Greek yogurt or sour cream or a sprinkling of feta cheese - you get the idea, this is incredibly versatile! Stick to the exact recipe for a straight, wonderful bisque, or go crazy with additions! And, you'll probably have all the ingredients in your pantry already, another plus. Keeper!",

It was by far the best recipe I had researched for tomato bisque, and I used it as my foundation recipe then built from there, I still use the exact same ingredients (except for one carrot, I chop up one carrot with the celery and it helps with sweetness and a deeper flavor profile) so other than that carrot, everything is the exact same but I played around with the amounts Until I reached the Umami perfection I craved. Every person I know thought I was crazy because the average person has only had canned tomato soup that you add a can of water to, so they all thought I was nuts, everyone claimed to HATE tomato soup, but after trying the bisque I made they were amazed and have talked me into making 50 gallons for a fundraiser next month. This is a great recipe and it's very forgiving if you mess up something. Your chicken broth is your best friend and so is paprika. There's nothing that one of them can't fix in this recipe.",

I have made it as is which is amazing as well as variations such as adding carrots or butternut squash which can lend a sweetness to the soup. I\u2019ve made it with dried basil as well as fresh basil (fresh is best if available). I\u2019ve used everything from whole milk, to half and half, to heavy cream whatever I\u2019ve had on hand and it has always turned out a winner.  The kids are always excited to hear I\u2019m making a batch of Tomato Bisque. Pairs well with grilled cheese.
