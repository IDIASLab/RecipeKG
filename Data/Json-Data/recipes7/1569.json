I was feeding four people so I doubled the whole recipe, but TRIPLED the sauce recipe and it came out perfect. I decreased the lime juice by 50% to account for tartness of tamarind, and didn't use as much fish sauce as the recipe called for. I omitted the oyster sauce (didn't have any) and used veggie bullion instead of chicken stock. I made other subs since I didn't have some of the veggies, and wanted to make it vegetarian: I used tofu in place of both the chicken and shrimp. I didn't have bean sprouts, but I DID have baby Bok Choy so I used that. And I used thinly sliced carrots. Other than that, I followed the recipe steps and amounts exactly and it made the best Pad Thai I've ever made (and I make Pad Thai often!). Excellent and very flexible recipe. Thanks!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is amazing. The v first time i made it all my family and friends raved that it was better than all the thai restaurants. I did however add a lil tamarind juice to get the real pad thai flavor. It is only about 2 dollars in most stores. Just ask someone who works at the store where it is because it is hard to find on your own. I also reduced the fish sauce down a couple tablespoons and same with the lime juice because the tamarind has a sweet and sour taste to it already. I definetly suggest that you try this recipe. REVISED: So I have made this about 20 times by now and i think i have it perfected. First of all if you are feeding a family of six like mine the recipe should be doubled. Also I know this seems like overkill but I add a packet of pad thai seasoning to the liquid mixture and it makes the sauce just perfect. I also think it helps the sauce thicken up a little. The sauce packet should be near the asian sauces at the store and is usually like 1 dollar. I also suggest that you do not omit any ingredients. For example the green onion cilantro and bean sprouts really make this pad thai worth making. I also add about 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the sauce and about triple the chili sauce because we love sweet and spicy food.",

Some changes I made: Instead of lime juice I now use \"True Lime\" packets. They work great. I also omitted the green onions since I didn't have any around. In stead I used what I had which included Asparagus Spinach Cabbage Carrots. YUM! I sauteed the some onion for a bit and then added the other veggies. No chicken on hand so I went with shrimp that I had already cooked and frozen when it was cheap in the market. One other change I made... My husband and I love the peanut taste. I added nearly twice the sauce like other readers and then threw in about 1/3 cup crunchy peanut butter for good measure. Try this recipe. It tastes like what you get in the Thai restaurants but 1/4 the price..and right now that's really important.",

It may have been because I used fresh limes and squeezed the juice in but it seemed extra limey compared the kind I've usually gotten in Thai restaurants. I also feel that the cilantro is perhaps not the right herb to top this with but I think restaurants perhaps use Thai basil of if you can't find Thai basil then regular basil. It's overall a decent dish maybe not quite exactly right to me though.",
