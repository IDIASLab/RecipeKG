The textural combination of squash and potatoes works well together and the spices make it very flavorful!  I didn't have any madras curry powder so I used yellow curry powder and some crushed maras (yes, maras) pepper; you may want to cut back on the hot pepper if you don't like things too spicy.  This is a delicious, flavorful soup and I will definitely make it again!",

But it had a mushy texture rather than smooth i guess from all the starches.  It was just eh didnt wow me with the flavors.  Will not be making again",
