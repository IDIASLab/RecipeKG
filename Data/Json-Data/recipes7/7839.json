The dried mint is not 'minty' at all but rather lends a sweetly herbal flavor to the sauce. You can leave out the lamb shank, but it is the secret ingredient that makes the sauce extra delicious. Many people prefer San Marzano&reg; tomatoes, but they are expensive and I think our own domestic tomatoes actually make a better sauce.",

I followed it exactly the first time and it was a winner.\n     The second time I opted to make a stock out of the ingredients which had bones..... not for me, but for family who may be a bit finicky about having a bone in their gravy/sauce.  \n     That is the only change that I made, but for #3, I want to return to the original recipe.\n     When I saw the words 'north end' ..... I  thought 'oh good, this is one from my hometown', but when I saw that the author was from another city, another country..... and after mentioning to my wife, she said.... 'hey - a lot of cities have a north end' - but make no mistake:\nThis is the best tomato based gravy/sauce on Allrecipes, if not THE best recipe.",
