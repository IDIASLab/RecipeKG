Two cups of sugar for the cake seemed excessive to me so I cut it to one and that was more than enough sweetness for us. I checked the cake at 30 minutes it was already very brown and slightly overcooked so watch your time. Although the cream cheese frosting is tasty the one thing that I didn't like is that it just never really set or hardened at all stayed very gooey.",

I had a feeling it would be so I added about 2 tbsp butter and 1/4 c brown sugar to the pecans to make a caramel like coating on the nuts then sprinkled them on top of the cake and half mixed them in before baking. The texture was OK nice an dense like a carrot cake. Add cinnamon and vanilla and I think it would be good. I also added an extra 4 oz cream cheese and cup of pwdr sugar to the frosting. I'm glad I did the extra cream cheese frosting made up for the bland cake!",
