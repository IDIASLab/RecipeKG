I cut the sugar by 75% because I don't like things that are sweet. It worked perfectly. I made a couple of changes, I didn't have any red bell peppers so I used fresh cayenne peppers cut into strips and I used sesame oil instead of olive.  This is a refreshing and light meal.

When I make a salad like this one all bets are off. I followed the directions for the dressing but after that I did my own thing. I wanted a little more Asian flare so I picked up some bamboo shoots and snow peas at the store. Secondly I thought the red pepper sounded a bit off so I left it out. And since I hate cilantro left that out too. But I made it twice and after the second time I'm thinking it needs red and maybe some yellow too so next time I'll add the pepper but the color remains unknown to me at this time. I loved this salad. It's beyond easy to make and it's so delish. I hope everyone who tries it enjoys it as much as I did. Have fun!!!!",
