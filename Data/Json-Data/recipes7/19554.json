I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings used a small cookie scoop and ended up with 24 delicious little mini tarts. For a variety of flavors I used orange marmalade strawberry and plum with star anise preserves for the filling. The tart shell almost melts in your mouth and using the food processor this is so very easy to make. I was thinking thumbprint cookies when I was filling with the preserves but they certainly don t taste like cookies definitely pastry. We really enjoyed the bite-size tarts and I ll use the mini-muffin tin for this recipe in the future. PaulaM11 thanks for sharing your recipe.",
