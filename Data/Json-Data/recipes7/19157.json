I prepped all my ingredients the night before and I had this assembled today by the time my oven preheated.  Easy and delicious.  I've already had 2 servings. I did however decide to put the bread cubes in a bowl and blend in the softened Nutella before adding it to my buttered pan.  At 40 minutes the toothpick test seemed moist with Nutella rather than egg and the top was brown, so I figured it was done.  After I cut into squares, it probably was ready 5 min sooner.",
