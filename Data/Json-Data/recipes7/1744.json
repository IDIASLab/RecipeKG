The apricot flavor really dominates and the sugar on the crystallized ginger doesn't melt or have the best texture. I would absolutely make this again with a few tweaks.",

Although I love candied ginger it did not appeal to me in this recipe so I left it out. I make sure to use roasted/salted pistachios to balance the sweetness of the fudge. I also use a mix of Turkish apricots (also called Mediterranean) which are sweet and California apricots which are tart.",
