Also didnot have Grand Marnier but used Orange Triple Sec liqueur. Baked in oven for 1 -1/2 hours at 275 in a taller cast iron pan. Other recipes mentioned boiling over but with the lower temp higher sided pan I did not have any issues. At the end I used a potato masher to create thickness. We used the cranberry sauce to mix with BBQ sauce over left over Turkey. It was very awesome!",
