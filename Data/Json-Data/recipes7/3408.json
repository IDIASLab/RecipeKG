The cooking time in this recipe is perfect the radishes get softened - but still have a crispness to them. Cooking also brings out the 'rootiness' of the radish but they are still peppery. I did end up adding more wine near the end for flavor but really if you 'salt & pepper to taste as the recipe suggests you should have no problem with blandness. Thanks for the recipe - we'll do it again!",

Pretty good and I'll most likely make again when I'm looking for something \"different\". Thanks!",
