I am not a big fan of green peppers but I followed the advice given and I am glad I did. Then you can adjust if you want to. I think that next time I might just add alittle more jalapeno just to spice it up a bit. Took a tally at the Super Bowl game and they thought it was great!! Thanks Redirg!! I will make this again.",

I've been told I have to bring this to every get together. The best way to describe the taste is a sweet-hot spaghetti sauce. I end up not taking it all to the party so the leftovers I just throw into spaghetti sauce or chili I have in the freezer. I partially agree that you should add all the ingredients the first time you make it. I ve made it twice and the only substitution I would suggest is instead of jalapenos use red pepper flakes. The first time I made this with jalapenos there was no heat so I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes. The second time I made it I skipped the hassle of chopping jalapenos and added 1.5- 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes. (I don t like things too hot and this was the perfect amount of slow-building heat.) Quick summary of my changes no jalapenos 1.5-2 tsp. red pepper flakes jar of roasted red peppers (instead of pimentos) and 1.5 TBSP sugar.",
