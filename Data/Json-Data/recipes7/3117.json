I didn't have caraway seeds or currants, so I only used raisins. I made one round with the raisins, and one without, because some of my family doesn't like raisins. I liked the one with the raisins better. They gave it a nice mildly sweet flavor. Maybe it was my oven, but I found that I needed to increase the baking time about 5-7 minutes and I had to drape foil over the bread for the last 10 minutes or so, to prevent over-browning. All in all, this was good.",

Round loaves: I like my Irish Soda Bread in round loaves, not in loaf pans.  This makes 2 round loaves, so we ate one and gave the other away!",

As far as traditional goes, because this recipe is one of the only ones to not have eggs in it, it is a bit closer to 'traditional' Irish Soda bread (which is just buttermilk, flour, soda, and salt). If you ask me, this variation is much more flavorful, but a lot closer to the right texture.  As far as dried fruit goes, I had a neighbor who immigrated from Ireland who made soda bread with currants in it all the time.",

I omitted the caraway seeds, and used all raisins since I didn't have currants. My husband doesn't like raisins, so I reserved them until I was kneading the dough, then added them to only one loaf, kneading them in right before I formed the loaf for baking.  I had to bake for an extra 15 minutes at 375 F, for a total of 45 minutes baking time. I took the loaves out of the oven when the tops were golden brown and a knife inserted into the middle came out clean.   I'll definitely make this again -- possibly tomorrow! :)",
