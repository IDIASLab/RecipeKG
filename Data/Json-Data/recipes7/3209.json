We did not have sour cream so we used vanilla yogurt instead if we had to do this again instead of doing the 3/4 cup of yogurt we would of tried 1/2 cup as yogurt is more runny then sour cream so then we would not of had to add more flour to make these cookies the right consistency. These are so moist and delicious and the cream cheese frosting is the bomb! Finally they were really red we got red food coloring from Micheal's and it worked 100 times better then the red you buy in most grocery stores",

The color was a beautiful red as well. The only adjustment we made was that we used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares of unsweetened baking chocolate. (My friend and I have a sweet tooth...) The cream cheese frosting goes perfectly with the cookie recipe. We stirred frozen raspberries into it which gave the frosting a pink color and a hint of tartness. Topped with some crushed walnuts and they were gone in NO TIME!",
