        "description": "I once worked a bike messenger in San Francisco (switching over to a scooter after 2 days). The money wasn't great, so for lunch I'd get a beef pirozhki from one of those sketchy delis in the back of big city corner stores. They only cost 2 bucks, delivered a ridiculously high number of calories, and even though I knew it wasn't the healthiest thing to eat, I grew to love the taste. So, for this recipe, I set out to recapture that experience.",

But in my 20s, I would often go to the local corner store, which SF has so many cute little corner stores, owned by some ethnic group or other.  Chicago has nothing like that.  And when I would go to the local corner store, I would buy one of their beef stuffed pirozhki. It was like heaven eating them.  Also I was a bike messenger in Chicago for a summer and tried it in SF, but lasted only a few weeks.  The hills were too much for me in SF. Anyway I made the recipe.  It was super easy, and came out perfect, exactly as I remember them in SF.  I had been thinking of making a puff pastry for the same purpose (vegetarian), but this is probably better than a puff pastry and 100X easier.  Also I try making Indian style stuffed pastries, but making the stuffing can be so complicated with all the spices required.  So thanks a million. Ann",
