Baked one pan and put the other two in the freezer uncooked in accordance with the recipe submitter\u2019s note.   I cooked for 50 minutes,  it didn\u2019t quite feel done in the center, so added another 10 minutes for a total of 1 hour.  The consistency was just about perfect, firm enough to slice but easy enough to spread.  Next time,  I\u2019ll increase the salt and nutmeg a little, but I\u2019ll also add a bit of dry sherry.  Made yesterday, and served for lunch today with a garnish of chopped red onion and hard boiled eggs.  This one\u2019s a keeper if you\u2019re a lover of chicken liver pate.  Thanks for submitting your recipe.",
