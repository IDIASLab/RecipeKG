        "description": "Watermelon pickle is made using the white part of the watermelon's rind. It is delicious by itself as a winter treat or as a condiment with turnip greens or turkey and cornbread dressing. Home canning is a delightful cooking experience, but  requires equipment such as a canner (very large pot), a rack for the jars to rest in, and the jars and lids. I recommend following the home canning guidance in the 'Ball Blue Book of Preserving' to obtain precise instructions on how to sterilize jars and guarantee results that are tasty and safe.",

I cut back by half the second time and ooh-la-la. I agree with an earlier poster - use fresh spices for the canning. I doubled the spices in the jars the second time & added some whole allspice. And I have experimented, adding some pineapple chunks and dried cranberries a few times. Nice. This is *really* is a great base recipe, I've enjoyed it and I can see doing a lot with it as time goes on. Thanks for sharing, Keryne.",

This produced about 20 cups of cut up cubes which filled 12 pint jars.   I find the easiest way to peel is the following: cut watermelon in half lengthwise.  Cut each half again lengthwise. Cut each of these sections into slices about 1 1/2\" thick.   I then peel each section with a vegetable peeler.  I leave a little of the pink on as I think it makes a prettier pickle.   I added about 1/2 t of red pepper flakes to 3 of the jars for my friends who like things spicy.\n\n.",
