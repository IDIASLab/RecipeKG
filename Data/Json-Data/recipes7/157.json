I was looking for a cookie made with oil to save on the cost of butter and I bake a lot with whole wheat so that was a plus though they taste great with white flour too. I've made a couple of variations of these cookies. One was to add 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon--this made them almost taste like snickerdoodles. Another time we substituted lemon extract for the vanilla--yummy!! Not sure what we'll try next. I did find that while the dough was easy to work with it was a little too sticky to roll into balls by hand. I ended up using a cookie scoop that I dipped into water occassionally to keep the dough from sticking. These were a real winner and will made in our home regularly. Thanks for the great recipe!! UPDATE--Our latest variation was to substitute 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder for 1/2 cup of the flour and adding 3 drops of peppermint oil. They were delicious!! Now what will we think of next...",

They weren't totally inedible but they tasted salty or like there was too much baking powder. We thought we made a mistake and tried again but it was still not good. We used small scoops and it was not nearly enough time to cook the cookie through. I'd keep looking for another recipe. Sorry!",
