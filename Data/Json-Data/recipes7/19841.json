Next time I'll make it exactly as specified but it was still great with modifications. I only had 1 c. strawberries so used 2 c. rhubarb. I was also out of lemons so I omitted the lemon juice; I think the fresh lemon juice would've brightened the flavor and made it even better. I was also in a rush so melted the butter rather than creaming it with the sugar; that may have affected the texture somewhat but the cake was still moist and light. Thanks for a great new recipe.",
