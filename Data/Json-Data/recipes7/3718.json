Other than adding a tbsp of baking powder (as I prefer fluffy pancakes) and an extra tbsp of sugar since I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, I followed the recipe to the letter and the batter was the perfect thickness for scooping and pouring. I lowered the heat on my frying pan to medium low and these pancakes cooked up fluffy and perfect very quickly (2-3 minutes on the first side; 1 minute after flipping). My kids loved them, comparing them to having chocolate cake for breakfast. I gave them 4 stars only because I had to add the baking powder. I will definitely make these again.",

In an attempt to bulk it up a bit I added a mashed over ripe banana added a couple scoops of flaxseed and omitted the butter. I think I also added some cinnamon. I also didn't have any chocolate chips and figured we could do without the added sugar anyway. I thought the batter was very thin but it cooked up nicely. Not a fluffy pancake by any means but tasty for sure! Not quite as thin as a crepe but not quite as fluffy as a traditional pancake. They were a hit with all the kids.",
