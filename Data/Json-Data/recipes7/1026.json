I had some fresh strawberries in the refridgerator that I didn't want to go bad and decided to use them for this dessert.  I am amazed at how great the cobbler presented itself and tasted.  I used a stoneware pie dish and melted the butter in the oven as suggested but scaled back on the amount -about 3 Tbsp.  I mixed the ingredients as it stated and sliced the fresh strawberries onto the top (didn't place them in whole as they were extra large) until the top of the dish was blanketed with them.  I let the cobbler bake for about 50 minutes and served it warm with a dollop of cool whip on top.  Fantastic.  My dinner guest was quite amazed and impressed.  This was the easiest and one of the best tasting cobblers I've made to date (and I bake A LOT).  Next time I'll try experimenting with different fruits.",

Five stars for straightforward instructions and easily available ingredients. And five stars for being delicious, heavenly comfort food. I made this as the recipe directed, only adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. I think I had this in the oven in under five minutes from walking into the kitchen! Buttery, cakey topping, crispy along the edges, with a nice balance of fruit and batter. I used all strawberries, and can only imagine how good this would be with any number of other fruits as well. My only criticism, and it is a small one, is that I would like to see this fuller in the pan - as written, the recipe fills an 8x8 pan about half full. Next time I may try adding half again as much of both the batter and fruit ingredients so that it fills the pan more. However, who really cares so much about how it looks in the pan - it's what it looks and tastes like once it gets on your plate that counts, and this was gooooooood.",

                "reviewBody": "Been making this for ~15 years and it's great. Kind of surprised that Pam Anderson got a copyright on this recipe (2004); it's essentially a recipe that appeared in Cook's Illustrated magazine in ~1994 and even they admit they borrowed heavily from another source. The only difference is that CI's recipe uses 6T butter, which is in my opinion a better amount (see below). First let's explain what you should expect. This is not a conventional cobbler recipe; what you're going to get is a layer of fruit on the bottom with a very soft not quite custard-like cake on top. The butter that's been melted in the pan will sort of deep fry the edges and that is totally the best part. I agree with most of the reviewers that 3C of fruit is better than 2C, it's too thin otherwise. Also after much experimenting over the past 15 years it's better to add the fruit to the pan first and then add the batter. The fruit will end up on the bottom anyways and adding the batter last will ensure it's more evenly distributed and not just pushed to the edges. When you add the batter the butter will ooze up and around the sides and essentially fry the edges, 4T butter just isn't enough to accomplish this feat that's why 6T is better. Also don't just melt the butter, let it brown slightly it will greatly improve flavor. One last note, if you're using berries, especially raspberries, add an additional 1T of flour to the batter, which will help it not to be quite so \"wet\".",
