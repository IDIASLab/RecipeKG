I loved it the way it is however my daughter wants to omit the basil and reduce the cayenne for the class bunch. We live in Tennessee and she doesn't think her classmates can handle that much spice. We used the three ounce paper bathroom cups and wooden cocktail forks (purchased at the dollar store) and were able to make 15 mini paletas. The paper can be torn off the frozen paletas when they are ready to be eaten.",
