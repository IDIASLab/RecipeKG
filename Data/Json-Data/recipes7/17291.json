The dough was thick and I didn't think I would be able to spread it out to the whole pan-- I was sure the pan size was a typo but eventually I did get it spread out and after it was baked the thickness was perfect. Also I had to add a lot more cream to the frosting to make it spreadable. The frosting was also delightful. I'll be making these a lot.",
