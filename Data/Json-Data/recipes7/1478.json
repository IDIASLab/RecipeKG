I let it sit for about 15 minutes and it firmed up a little. It was still not thick enough to roll. I didn't want to add more confectioners' sugar or powdered milk. I decided to add flaked coconut. After adding about a cup the dough was finally firm enough to roll. It was still sticky so I used a cookie scoop and dropped the balls into the sugar then rolled them. They do firm up in the refrigerator and make a very tasty treat.",
