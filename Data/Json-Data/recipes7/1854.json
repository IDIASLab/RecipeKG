Would use about half the suggested butternut amount next time. Before serving I added the juice of one lime (really brightened all the flavors) 1 tsp salt (also really brought out the flavors) and 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper which gave it just a little bit of a kick (the carribean seasoning we found wasn't spicy so taste before adding this in case yours is). Some reviewers mentioned that the flavors needed a bit more time to really meld so I opted to cook everything (except the chicken) in the crockpot on low all day. Then an hour before dinner I added the cubed chicken. The flavors and consistency were perfect!",

Instead of 28 oz. can of tomatoes added tomato juice I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes w/ onion & garlic; I increased the cubed butternut squash; and left my boneless chicken thighs whole. I let it all simmer together for 45 minutes on Low-Med heat after browning the thighs and following the rest of the addition/timing per the recipe. Delicious on plain steamed white rice - for me both adult-approved & kid-approved!",
