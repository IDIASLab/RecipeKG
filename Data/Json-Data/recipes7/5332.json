I took a previous reviewers advice and added in about a half cup (maybe more) of chopped pecans. I thought this was perfect. All the ingredient measurements were spot on which I really appreciate. I actually made muffins out of this recipe (we're more of a muffin family than a loaf family) and I got twelve muffins that were a little on the bigger side. Right before baking I pushed in a couple extra cranberries into the top of each muffin and sprinkled just a little extra chopped pecans on top. These baked up wonderfully and both kids and husband really enjoyed these.",

It must be that the banana sour cream and egg made up for that shortfall. So yes I will make this one again and be sure not to forget the butter as I'm sure it's even MORE flavorful and light with it. I used fresh cranberries that needed to be used up which increased the tartness and one thing I would add would be walnuts. Thanks for giving us a nice change from typical banana bread.",
