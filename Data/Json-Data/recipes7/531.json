I was making up a batch and realized I didn't have any molasses.  I used pure maple syrup instead and heaped the spices a little more than I usually do.  To my surprise they were quite good.  My youngest daughter wouldn't even try them because they were a golden color and not brown like \"gingernaks\" are supposed to be.  Eventually she gave in and loved them as much as the originals.",

But I'm SO happy to not have to give up gingersnaps which I LOVE! I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 cup butter. I switched around the ginger & cinnamon amounts because I love cinnamon! Baking time was 8 min. I might chill the dough before baking as the dough was kind of hard to roll into balls. Thanks for a keeper!",

But then the longer they sat out (I didn't even cover them they were so moist) the better they tasted. My ultra-picky boyfriend tried one and said \"It's sandy inside \" but my father LOVES them. They are very filling cookies and have a nice complex flavor. The sugar on top of the cracked surface is very pretty. I like how they're thick and chewy plus somewhat healthier with the whole wheat. The only modifications I made were adding one cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar plus a little less flour than called for. Check them early because my first batch burned.",

The spices are perfect and we devoured nearly two dozen in one evening.:) I took the advice of another reviewer & used apple sauce for half of the butter called for. It was the only change I made & it worked out great! I'm sure the full amount of butter would only make these more awesome I just wouldn't eat as many!:P I halved the recipe and my batch made 36 perfect sized cookies. Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe! Will make again & again!:)",
