                "reviewBody": "This recipe is flawed. The ingredients call for 1-1/2 cups of dark chocolate but the directions say to use that amount both in the cake and the granache. I didn't realize that until I started baking. So I used all of it in the cake. I didn't have more so I substituted cocoa powder plus butter for the amount in the granache. Also 1-1/2 cups is not how dark chocolate is sold... And does the recipe mean baking chocolate or a dark chocolate bar or chips which have less cacao? I used two baking chocolate bars. I was unable to find dried red chilies so I substituted 1 tsp cayenne pepper. The cake came out good tasting and the people who ate it said the flavor was great. But the recipe is confusing about how much chocolate to use (and the cake took 10 mins longer than it said for baking).",

Considering it had 1 cup butter 6 eggs and almost no flour it is very low gluten and really wanted to try this. What I ended up doing that worked out amazing was cutting it up in large cubes of cake in a big bowl and drizzling the granache over it. Served it with the yogurt (as indicated) or vanilla ice cream. If I make this again I will NOT use the toothpick test so carefully and follow the time on the recipe. I had baked it about 40min to get it to clean toothpick stage.",
