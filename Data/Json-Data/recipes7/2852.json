It doesn't need anything added to it but at the same time it's perfect because can be played with to suit everyone's taste. I prefer it as is and my boyfriend likes it with powdered sugar or cinnamon or with yogurt. Thank you for sharing your recipe Dasha!:D",

I followed the directions exactly as written but found the recipe to be slightly flawed. The directions state to mix the margarine and sugar in a large bowl but in a large bowl they can't blend effectively. The small amount of ingredients called for by this recipe would blend better in a smaller bowl. I would recommend the addition of some vanilla or almond extract for a little more flavor.",
