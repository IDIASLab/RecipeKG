                "reviewBody": "**Please read this review if you had trouble with this recipe or are new at baking! \nThis recipe is good but has flaws with the method. Heavy cream (or heavy whipping cream) CAN'T be beaten into the peak stage with any presence of fat or grease in the bowl or on the beaters- it won't whip. This is why many recipes will specifically say \"start with clean bowl and beaters\". So pouring the heavy cream into a big bowl of fat (cream cheese) will most likely end up with a broken mess.  \n\nThe cream needs to be beat to stiff peaks FIRST & separately. I also would suggest adding 1 tsp of cream of tartar to the cream to help stabilize it. Place cream, cream of tartar in CLEAN bowl (I always use stainless steel one when whipping cream) and clean beaters into the fridge to chill. After it's chilled whip it to stiff peaks then place back in fridge while you do the other part. \n\nBeat the cream cheese, extract, sugar (I used powdered sugar to again help with keeping it stiff) and I added orange zest, so its combined. Then I added about 1/3 of the whipped cream to the cream cheese and gently folded it together, then I added the remaining whipped cream.  Folding a smaller amount first lets things mix better and requires less folding/mixing in the end. \n\nThe taste was great! Still the great tang from the cream cheese (although subdued a tad) but not overly sweet as cream cheese frosting can be. It piped well for me using this method!",

This is frosting -- it's NOT meant to be piped like buttercream icing.  If you can get it to the consistency that will pipe -- great -- but my own experience is that it will probably \"break\" if beaten that much. Secondly, my comment about \"leaving it out\" doesn't mean to leave it out overnight or for a long period of time -- dairy shouldn't be left out long term, as many reviewers have noted.  The comment was meant to compare this frosting to standard whipped cream frosting which starts to \"fade\" very quickly and can be problematic.  If you're set on trying to use this as decoration instead of just the frosting I meant it as, you may want to try adding some Confectioners (XXX or 10X) sugar. That should help to stiffen it . Also, using chilled beaters and bowls is always a good idea when working with dairy. Hope you enjoy!  Happy baking!",
