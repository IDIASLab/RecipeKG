I used half extra sharp and half medium sharp cheddar. I could only find a 7oz plain yogurt so I just used that with a little milk added. I also added 3-5 dashes of tabasco to liven the batter up. Not too much, just to give a hint of it. They were for a club meeting brunch, but they tasted so good my husband wanted me to keep them for us and pick something else for the brunch at the store. I had 30 so I put them in the freezer. As of now, I have had heated them up for five more meals, and it's time to make some more. They freeze well and heat in 15 seconds...or less.",
