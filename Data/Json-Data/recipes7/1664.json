I just made these today, and so far the first three criteria are met!  These rolls are GORGEOUS; even the dough is beautiful when you're working with it.  They didn't taste bland to me at all, and usually I have to increase the salt or the sweetener in doughs.  They are soft and yummy.  I made 6 hamburger buns, 6 hot dog.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on the hamb. buns.  I just greased my cookie sheets - worked great!  I'll see how they hold up in terms of getting stale - homemade bread does dry out sooner, but that's because it's not full of all those preservatives anyway!  I have the leftovers in the freezer and will update on the \"freshness factor\" when I thaw them.  You could easily get 24 smaller rolls out of this recipe. Highly recommend!\n*** Next day... I pulled one of the hamb. buns out of the freezer & thawed it in the microwave.  Still very good texture & softness, although if you overheat it the bun can get a little tough.  Thawing on the counter might have been a better idea.  But this is good enough for me - I will look no further!  LOVE IT!   *** Even more updates - yes, thaw them on the counter, then heat in the microwave JUST until warm (for me, about 25 seconds for a hamb. bun).  Delish.",

                "reviewBody": "Lovely soft, ethereal, yeasty pillows that will elevate your burgers well beyond the ordinary. Perfect exactly as written. Just be mindful not to add too much flour. The dough should feel ever-so-slightly sticky to the touch, so go somewhat light on your first flour addition. If you squeeze some in your hand, it should adhere just for a second or two before falling when you release it. If using a bread machine, check it after the initial kneading, while it rests, before the long knead part of the cycle, and add flour if too sticky, add a few drops of water if the dough seems heavy or dry. Check again 2-4 minutes into the second knead and adjust again, as necessary. The complaint that these rolls are too \"dense\", providing sufficient rising time is allowed per the recipe, is because of 1) insufficient kneading 2) insufficient rising time or 3) too much flour in proportion to liquid. The amount of flour when baking breads is not a precise science. Think of it as an \"area\" and not a \"point.\" The amount can vary from one time to the next, depending on the humidity, altitude, barometric pressure, accuracy of measurement, if you've sifted, age of your flour, etc. Work by feel and don't consider any measurement to be carved in stone, if you want to produce perfect yeast breads of any kind. Use the minimum amount of flour necessary to achieve the above-described feel to the dough, and you'll make the most heavenly bread on earth, each and every time.",

The buns turned out perfect & I even made sandwich rolls (like hoagie). The consistency of this finished product made a perfect (not soggy or mushy) hamburger bun. It is important for all cooks to know when you work with yeast it is important to read on the jar/package the manufacturers recommendations for liquid temperatures. I learned that because I was adding liquid to the yeast/flour mixture I could put in the liquid when it registered 120-130 degrees. It probably wouldn't have risen had I not read the instructions on the yeast pkg first.",

                "reviewBody": "This a nice hamburger bun recipe. My family and I really enjoyed it. I have read many of the reviews and think I can offer some help to those who are stuggling. You will have a very dense bun if you add too much flour. When you are adding the last two cups of flour, add them in a little at a time. When the dough starts to pull away from the bowl and is not so sticky that you have a sticky \"pool\" of it at the base of your bowl, you have the right amount of flour. It will still be a little sticky, but you will have a very light dough.  If you find that your dough isn't rising well, there are a couple things you can do. First, check your yeast and make sure it is still good. You can do this by adding some yeast to warm water and adding a little flour or sugar. Leave it for about 10 minutes. At this point, it should be frothy or creamy looking. If it doesn't do anything, you need new yeast. Another thing you could do is switch flours to bread flour. It has a higher gluten content, and it should do better in the rising phase. If you wish to make the recipe with 100% whole wheat flour add a little gluten flour; a tablespoon for every cup of flour. I use this for making a 100% whole wheat breads with freshly ground wheat. It will help your dough rise. I hope this helps someone. :)",

                "reviewBody": "The taste was OK--it tasted a bit salty though. The recipe submitter said they are light and fluffy, but that's not how they turned out for me. They were kinda of hard from the outside and chewy from the inside like french bread. They were also too heavy for a hamburger or hot dog bun. The bread is thick and heavy that it steals the spotlight from the slice of meat or hot dog sausage you use. The bread fills you up before you reach the meat. Perhaps this recipe would be better to use for dinner rolls? Definitely not hamburger buns. Also, I wanted to add that you need way less flour than the recipe calls for. I almost used 4 cups. As soon as I mixed 3 cups of flour w/ the yeast mixture, the forming dough looked dry. The dough was easy to work with. Kneading the dough was the only light & fluffy thing in this recipe. Sorry. I may try again since I like to give some recipes a second chance. We'll see.",
