After pouring it into the pan, I let it set 2 days to make sure it was nice and set up. I did spray my chef's knife w/ cooking spray, just to make cutting a bit easier, and that worked great. These are nice and jelly-like, but also soft with a sweet/tart flavor that is just wonderful, and so simple to make too! I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
