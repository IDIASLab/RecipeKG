Mine turned out darker/\u201cbrowner\u201d than others (maybe because I used too much tomato paste, as I followed that tip and did tomato paste instead of sauce) but it\u2019s very good.  I also did 4 T. of curry powder, instead of 3.  Also, to make mine thicker and to have all the flavors blend more, I cooked the full can of coconut milk right in with the rest of the ingredients, rather than at the end.  I was a little concerned about under-cooking the chicken, especially since I had added the coconut milk, so I cooked longer-I used the POULTRY setting.   It turned out thick and perfectly cooked (meat thermometer tested over 165\u00b0).  Served over jasmine brown rice, made separately in the IP while my coconut chicken curry stayed warm on stovetop (extra IP stainless steel liner is key!), and with a side of steamed broccoli.  I added a little crushed red pepper (maybe 1/4 tsp.) before I put the lid on, because I think the recipe needed just a little kick.  I never experienced the \u201cburn\u201d or \u201cerror\u201d message on the IP (as others expressed concern about), and I think that\u2019s because I had plenty of liquid ingredients..  I would make again with less tomato paste (but still with paste instead of sauce).",

My only change might be to add a little more curry powder. Also the recipe does not specify whether the chicken breasts should be on-the-bone or boneless skinless. I went with on-the-bone breasts but trimmed off excess skin. When it came time to shred the meat it came off the bone with ease. I think cooking it that way made it all the more flavorful.
