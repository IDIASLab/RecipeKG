Although new to our menu, it has become a holiday favorite. My family requests I make my own turkey before Thanksgiving so I can serve this salad as an appetizer at our holiday feast. I hope you will find it as enjoyable as we do. Enjoy it on rolls, in wraps, or as a spread with crackers.",

I used mayo, but the sweetness and the orange really stood out making it taste like it was made with miracle whip (which I'm not fond of at all).  I will try this again, but will use my own cranberry sauce (Martha Stewart's cranberry grape compote!) and maybe add some chopped onion.",
