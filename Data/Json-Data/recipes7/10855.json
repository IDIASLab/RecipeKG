Really fantastic. I did omit 1/2 cup of the sugar (so just used 1 cup), and otherwise made with very fresh, high-quality ingredients... this always seems to help (fresh GF flour, organic sugar/evaporated cane, organic local farm egg, etc). I did use 1 cup of regular-size semi-sweet chocolate chips (totally fine) and added the optional 1 cup walnuts.  Also, I baked it in a bundt pan... The recipe made quite a bigger batch of batter than I anticipated, and reading the comments about the longer cooking time and gumminess a few experienced, this seemed like a great way to \"thin out\" the loaf for even cooking and browning, and still keep a nice presentation.  It worked! Only added about 7 minutes extra baking time (~52 mins total).  Thanks for the recipe... I will definitely keep this in my files as a staple dessert and breakfast cake!",
