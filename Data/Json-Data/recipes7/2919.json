I had to add a minimal amount of flour as I was rolling the cookies out and the they stuck to the glass I was using to cut out round cookies. With the last of the dough I tried rolling (about a spoonful) per cookie into small balls and then flattening them a bit with a spatula. These turned out great and were so much easier than trying to roll out the dough. The cookies were a little thicker and very good that way.",
