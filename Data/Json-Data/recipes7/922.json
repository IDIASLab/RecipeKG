I made it again and I cut the recipe in 1/4. Instead of using towels to strain the water out I used my salad spinner. From start to finish it only took me 3 hours to make. It was so much easier this way and it made 6 pints.\n Try this in tuna salad instead of relish. I love it on Lima Beans and rice too.",

Needless to say my out of town relatives swarm my home yearly for this event. Sad to say it was a rainy weekend this year ( 2010 ) but being true lovers of this yearly even we went. Natually we HAD to buy our fair share of these fantastic onions ( 50 pounds each - lol ) So can you imagine my concern as what to do with these lovely pearls once company departed??? This being my favorite recipe site I gave a lot of thought to each recipe I examined and THIS WAS THE ONE!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RELISH RECIPE!! It is heavenly!!!! Actually it took me back to my Grandma's kitchen in all aspects but mainly the relish it's self. If you are truely looking for a fantastic onion relish recipe of days gone by..STOP LOOKING...THIS IS IT. I would give it a 10 star if it were available... I ended up with 22 pints of the worlds BEST RELISH....I followed the recipe to the T...Again thank you so much for sharing this with me and all those who may be looking for a fantastic recipe. It's fantastic on everything..think hot dog!! It can't be beat along side a bowl of beans and rice with a chunk of hot corn bread slattered in butter...You go girl!!!!! Mary in Vidalia..",

It definately outshone the sweet green! I am making it again this summer too many requests for it! Here is a hint...chew gum when working with the onions helps with the tears!",

                "reviewBody": "This was a very good basic relish recipe. I found it a little on the sweet side but not much sweeter than a typical Bread and Butter pickle recipe. I did make a few changes but not substantial ones that would alter the flavor. First: I didn't want the texture of ground/grated onions so I diced them instead. Since they were less finely chopped I upped the volume to 50 cups instead of 40. Second: I used red and green peppers and only used 8 since mine were very large and heavy. And third: I put the spices into a cloth square since I didn't want the seeds to remain in the relish after it was completed. Fourth: I used regular yellow onions (given to me free). I did not bother trying to squeeze every drop of joice out the vegetables with towels instead draining them in batches in the colander. There was a little liquid left in the bottom of the onion bowl after I finished but not enough to dilute the brine. I did squeeze those handfuls before I tossed them into the pot. Final product yielded 10 quarts of an attractive and tasty moderately sweet relish. I'm getting ready to make another batch with purple cabbage and we will see how it turns out.",
