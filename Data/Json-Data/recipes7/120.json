If you think the lemon juice makes them too tart add a little sugar. With this crust I wouldn't add sugar to the peaches. Try the peaches mixed with raspberries and blueberries. For a different topping mix together one part vanilla yogurt (I use fat free) with two parts whipped topping (Cool Whip). Great summer dessert!",

I did however substitute uncooked oatmeal/oats for the nuts because I don't care much for the flavor or the fat in nuts...It was wonderful! I think I may try wheat germ the next time as I think the crunchy texture would go nicely with this \"crust\". Overall a great dessert and quite easy to make!",
