I will add all of the marinade for the salmon to bake in the next time. My daughter thought the sauce had a great kick and wanted more.",

Next time I'll add more honey to achieve that. I only marinated my salmon for 30 minutes and it came out pretty flavorful. Before putting the salmon in the marinade I reserved some for glazing while I grilled the salmon. I grilled it over medium heat without turning it skin side down. It turned out really great. A keeper for sure! My husband said a couple of times that this was the best salmon I've made and I have tried quite a few recipes over the years.",
