You'll love this dish if you're into big, bold flavors, since there's nothing subtle about the seasoning here. Delicious served with beans, rice, and plantain chips. Garnish with more cilantro.",

I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I used the pressure cooker then finished it simmering on the stovetop until the sauce had cooked down to a thick consistency. And I'm mildly allergic to peppers so I left them out and used a can of Ro-tel instead. It was really delicious and the meat turned out very tender. The leftovers were incredibly delicious over eggs the next day.",
