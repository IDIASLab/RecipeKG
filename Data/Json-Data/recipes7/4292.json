When I was making this my wife came from a back room in the house and wanted to know what smelled so good. It does take ever bit of an hour to thicken up on a simmer but who cares your home will smell happy happy. Thank you mimosa.",

I made sure to simmer the liquid part and reduce it down about an hour.. then added the cranberries after they popped I reduced heat again and simmered until nice and thick.. tried it and OMG I actually might eat this with my meal and maybe next day on toast and I'll look up more things to use cranberry sauce in or on because this is really Yummy and smells amazing. thank you.",
