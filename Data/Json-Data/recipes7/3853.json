I do this because I can sneak nutrients into my children's diet without them knowing. I let some bread remain in a semi-open container overnight and used this because it was a little \"old\". I also cut the bread thick since my kids like it better that way. One thing I did change is I used maple sugar which is something I get when I'm up in Canada. It adds a lovely nuance to this dish I believe. A definite make again. Maybe New Years morning when we have a crowd of people staying over. Thank you super dish!!!",
