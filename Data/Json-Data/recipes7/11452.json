We've also substituted iceberg lettuce leaves for the buns to lower the calories. Messier but so yummy! Serve any extra slaw on the side. You can serve these over rice or on a bed of salad, too. We've also turned them into lettuce wraps to save more calories!",

I really enjoyed this recipe however I only used half of the chicken called for but used the full amount of the sauce. I also took a cue from a previous reviewer and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to add a bit more spiciness. With these changes I would definitely make this recipe again and I'm certainly glad I didn't overlook it based on the title!!:) Thanks for sharing your recipe CINDYJAKE!",
