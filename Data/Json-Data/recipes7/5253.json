It IS a bit labor intensive, pressing the crust into all those little tins, but so worth it in the end.   Tip on making the crust easier - cube your cold butter up and put it in the freezer. Put all of the crust mixture except the oats into your food processor, then add the frozen butter. Pulse until resembles coarse crumbs. Transfer to a big bowl and then mix in the oats. MUCH faster than cutting it in and distributes beautifully.   I made these exactly as described but did add a little vanilla to the apples. Very delicious. Took longer than stated to cook, about 30 minutes. Ultimately I put the broiler on to brown the tops better. I will make these often in the fall. Thanks for the recipe!",

The thing that makes it so perfect is that you can make the crisp part and the filling part ahead of time and refrigerate it.  Put together the cups and filling just before you need them. Bake them as directed. However, the *best* thing is that you can actually make them, bake them and then freeze them. They are actually *perfect* this way and taste exactly the same as freshly baked and cooled.  Pop them out on the counter just a little while before a party or guests coming. I keep them in the freezer now because you can actually defrost them in the microwave, too, in just a few seconds. They are great to have on hand. I do cut down on the butter by about 1/3, but other than that these are the absolutely perfect little treat.  Thanks, Weeble!",

Quartered dough, left 3 portions in fridge while working first batch.  GOOD IDEA:  I used pestle (from mortar and pestle set) to press dough neatly to fit mini tin muffin pan.

I just could not get the crust to the proper consistency for pressing in the pans by hand, so I put it through my food processor and pulsed until it started to clump. If you don't have a processor, then I would recommend softening your butter to at least room temperature before cutting in. I might even try that next time, as it was a fiddle trying to get that much volume of crust through my processor (I did it in two batches ~ I also might reduce the crust mixture next time as I had one cup left over after the final topping). I ended up short of apple filling by one whole pan, so it might be helpful to know how many cups are needed for the recipe instead of number of apples. Chopped pecans would be a wonderful addition to the topping. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.",

I halved it thinking I don't have that many pans. Not realizing it was mini muffins. So I made big ones! I am trying to use apples out of the freezer so I had already cooked them in the microwave. I just add butter sugar brown sugar apple pie spice and cinnamon after draining some of the water off. That was when I remembered your recipe so I used the crust part. I realized they were supposed to be mini's when I tried to take them out of the pan LOL! That would work much better holding together but I got them cooled enough put a cookie sheet over the pan flipped them out and they held together. Tastes so good!I'll do the mini crisps next time I still have more apples! Thanks.",

I think I'll try a food processor next time to save time. I ran out of the apple mix after filling about 40. I filled the rest with some canned peaches and they were also very tasty. My 13yo daughter liked the ones filled with peaches better then the apple. So if you run out of the apple mix try the peaches or what ever else you might have in the cabinets.
