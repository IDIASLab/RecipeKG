I had to make a few slight changes due to availability of ingredients at the supermarket I used celery hearts in place of celeriac and because I could not get squash I used a yam in place of that and the potato peelings. I left the skin on and chopped it into small cubes and it seemed to work out just fine. I also had some leftover bell pepper in the fridge that I threw in as well nearly a whole green one & a 1/2 of a red one seemed a perfect opportunity to keep them from going to waste! I followed the cooking instructions just as written and it came out perfectly resulting in a wonderful and very tasty broth. I searched for a way to use the leftover veggies as I hate and can't afford to waste and found a quite clever one. She suggested blending the veggies with some olive oil salt and other seasonings you like and a bit of acid such as lemon vinegar or wine. I haven't tried this yet but fully intend to. She did say that it comes out more tasty if your vegetables were roasted before-hand but still comes out ok if they weren't. Worth a shot! Could also make a good sauce if added to tomatoes perhaps.",

The next day I used it in a chicken stew and it ended up a most un-hearty smelling chicken stew...I may as well have put Earl Grey in my stew. But I LOVE this idea and will keep all my veggie extras in the freezer to experiment from now onwards..thank you so much:))",
