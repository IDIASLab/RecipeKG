I cut the chocolate by 1/4 of a cup and used another reviewer's tip on baking at 425 on the top rack for 35 minutes then at 350 for 15 minutes. I suggest putting the pie in the refridgerator after baking to allow the filling to set a bit because it seemed to be a bit runny without putting it in the fridge. Otherwise delicious! I will definetley make this pie again!",

I cut the chocolate by about 1/4 cup and it seemed just right maybe even less would be ok. The point is for the chocolate to act as a sweet counterpoint to the strong tartness of the berries. I made two pies in a row and they were all eaten within hours. Too bad blackberries are so seasonal I could get addicted to this stuff.",

I took others' recommendation of cutting back on the chocolate chips so I did by half (to 3/8 of a cup) and am glad I did. It was a nice fruit pie with just a hint of chocolate - not overbearing or overly sweet at all. It was also a perfect blend of all ingredients which made a pie that had a little \"sauce\" to it but didn't ooze out when cut. I also did an egg wash on the crust before baking. Delicious!",
