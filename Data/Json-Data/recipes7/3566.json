They turn out SO MUCH BETTER when you use eggs AND butter that are at room temperature.  I always increase the vanilla, and you'll notice almost all other chocolate chip recipes on here have more as well because it tastes better! :)  I also blend half chocolate chip&half semisweet chocolate chips.  Makes a huge difference in the blend of flavors! MY SECRET: Add 1/8-1/4C andes mint chips in place of some of the cc, and everyone will beg for more!! Always hand mix recipes like this! No mixers or your cookie will be flat!  My husband likes to microwave the cookies a tad & then of course eat w/a glass of milk.  Now my son copies him. :)  Though this is the recipe I've turned to for years, when I tried \"Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie\" on here & followed the advice of some reviews ...I switched.  They found the secret to the biggest, chewiest cookie with the right mixture of sweetness!",

Adding extra flour made them dry, combining crisco and butter didn't help and even baking chilled dough didn't make much difference.  Then...I saw an article in the Sunday paper about why I was having trouble.  This recipe was developed in the 1930s and flour was milled differently back then.  If you use a heavier bread flour and chill the dough for at least 24 hours you'll have the best cookies ever!  My husband raves about my chocolate chip cookies and so does everyone else who has them.  It'll be our little secret---ssshhhh!",

The only problem I ever had was the cookies used to come out flat. I eliminated this problem by making the dough the night before and leaving it in the refrigerator. I also recently started using parchment paper on my aluminum baking pans instead of baking spray or butter. The cookies come out perfect now and cleaning the pans is a snap. Since parchment paper comes in rolls and tends to curl up it can be a little tricky getting that first batch on the paper (an extra set of hands is very helpful). Once the pan has been in the oven the paper flattens out and is very easy to work with.",
