I had to increase the cocoa to about 1/2 cup instead of 1/4, and I had to add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt to give it some flavor.  I was surprised to find this recipe didn't have any salt listed.  It was good after those two things.",

We've never had it written down, so there's always too much inconsistency and variation.  Thanks for putting measurements to this!    I do always add a dash of salt and a bit more butter to mine than is called for here.   When I was a little girl, all my friends wanted to spend the night so they could have Chocolate Gravy for breakfast.  My kids have introduced several of their friends to it as well....looks like the tradition is in no danger of dying out anytime soon!",
