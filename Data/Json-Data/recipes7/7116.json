Stove top space was at a premium so I roasted them already cut for about 30 minutes at 400F and when cooked I added the butter and sugar to the hot pan, coating each piece, then added the teriyaki and stirred.  I put it back in the oven for another 5 or 10 minutes, stirred again to be sure I got all the glaze I could and served.  Very good!  Thank you, Lett101",

The only thing I did differently was I cut up the parsnips prior to boiling. The reason I did this is because parsnips are much larger at one end than the other and I wanted the pieces to cook more evenly. They are not hard so it is not difficult to cut raw. thanks for sharing!",

Next time I make it I will likely cut them and boil in two batches so the thin top parts do not get over cooked and mushy.",
