I did not include the chocolate chips. It took 3 oranges, 1 tablespoon of zest is produced per each (only 2 tsp. were needed from the last one). I've zested so many oranges now that I don't measure any more. One thing I'd like to try is making the 1/2 cup of flour from pistachios so that my friend that  has gluten intolerance can eat them. It was fun telling people that I had made \"greenies\", some expected them to be laced with pot.",
