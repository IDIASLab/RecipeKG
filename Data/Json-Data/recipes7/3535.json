My oldest son and I split this smoothie for breakfast this morning. Both he and I thought that this is a great flavored smoothie--adding the banana made it even better imo. The issue we had was the flax seed. It gave it a weird texture that made it.......unappealing putting it nicely. I'd like to try this again and possibly omit the flax seed. I think that's really the only thing we didn't like about it everything else about this smoothie was great.",

I only had about a cup of ice on hand but I'm sure that didn't affect the recipe that much. I used freshly ground nutmeg maybe about 1/4 teaspoon and it was just right. I think the cinnamon could be reduced to half a teaspoon too. I'm thinking that 2 tablespoons of honey and omitting the sugar would be better. Make sure to finely ground your flax or it will be gritty. I don't mind the texture though. This might be good with some fruit... While writing this review I remembered that I had some bananas in the freezer. Poured the remainder of my glass back in the blender with the rest and added a banana. With this addition you could cut out the sugar and leave the honey as is depending on how ripe the banana is. Also the coconut flavour weakens this way... The coconut milk should be increased to 3/4 cup to a cup and the milk decreased to 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup. Next time I will make sure to use the full amount of ice and test out my tweaks then it will be a 4 or 5 for sure.",
