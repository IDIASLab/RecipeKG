You can adapt the recipe to fit your pan merely by increasing in equal amts. , but we do not ever use more than 1 stick of butter or margarine . you can use any fruit you choose , but if using canned , drain some of the liquid if there's a lot . My favorite is peach ....I sometimes sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top of that one . This cobbler bakes up into a great cake-like dessert that's wonderful served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top !",
