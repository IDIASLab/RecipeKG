I love the stuff, but this is comparable to swallowing a spoonful of sugar :P It got the extra star from the vanilla & brown rice together, otherwise I would've given it a 1.

My husband has diabetes so I used a bit less than 1/2 cup of Splenda and 1 T packed brown sugar in place of the sugar. Still not really good for a diabetic but he can have a few bites. I only had regular raisins and they were pretty packed together so I added them in early. This gave them a bit of time to plump up. I make a homemade version of pumpkin pie spice so I used that in place of the cinnamon & used more because I love it:) Thanks for sharing!",
