Hubs gave a big thumbs up but in the end said it was a tad too sweet for his liking. Take that for what it is worth. I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup next time but that is the only change I will make.",

Whip 1 tsp of this slime into the milk and then you're on your way with the rest of the ingredients! My girls fought over this cornbread even though they don't eat dairy/gluten free!",

My GF adult twins told me that.  Used a 9 x 13 pan, and in my oven it needed ten additional minutes to be cooked high and very pretty.  Which I expected, given the pan size wasn't quite double the square inches in size.  It fed a party of ten adults generously, with about 1/3 leftover.  One 8 x 8 pan would not have been quite enough for the guests I had, though it said it was 12 servings.  Made honey butter to serve with it - a great idea!  And for being GF?  No one realized it (except the GF guests of honor at their family birthday party!) It is a little sweeter than traditional Southern cornbread, but not nearly as sweet as a Jiffy mix....and to me?  That makes it perfect!  It also was moister than Southern cornbread, and a bit less dense.  Two more things I really loved about it! I cut it into big tall 3 x 3 cubes, and piled them high in a big serving bowl.  People kept taking \"one more\" til the whole bowl was gone.  Thanks for the superb recipe!",
