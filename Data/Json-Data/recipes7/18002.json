        "description": "When the fruit in your house turns too overripe to enjoy on its own, this recipe will take that forgotten fruit and turn it into a masterpiece dessert. Forget cake, pudding, or cookie, it's all 3 combined if cooked properly! Sticking to one fruit really makes it a star in this dish. I've recently played with raisins as a main fruit, and 'very berry' with a combination of raspberries, boysenberries, blackberries, and strawberries. Serve a la mode. Delectable!",
