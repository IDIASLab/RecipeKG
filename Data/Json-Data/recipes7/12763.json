I made two changes to the recipe: I added 1/2 bag of mini chocolate chips to the cookie dough (it just felt right) and I added an egg to the brownie mix because when I mixed it as written it was way too dry and wouldn't blend. I used my large ice cream scoop to make large cookies and as such needed to increase the bake time to about 15 minutes. THANKS for the recipe!",

After making 3 pans I decided to spray cupcake liners and put the batter in those. Slightly better but still not great. Taste was decent, definitely better in the cupcake liners. Will keep looking.",

It was just powder with a couple wet spots on it; I wonder if there is a typo in the recipe? We added 2 more tablespoons of oil and 2 more tablespoons of water to get it to a batter consistency. I really recommend these cookies just make sure you add more liquid to the brownie mixture!:)",
