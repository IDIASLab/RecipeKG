The only problem is that it goes fast even when you triple and quadruple the batch! My kids like to top with sliced bananas, sprinkle with sugar and then caramelize with the torch. To finish it off, they drizzle it with homemade chocolate sauce to make a banana split creme brulee.",

Only change i made was using 1 3/4c heavy cream and 1/4c of skim, bc thats what i have normally in the fridge. And i didn't strain the cream, so i could keep the vanilla bean particles in the cream mixture. Otherwise followed everything exactly. For me, it only filled 6 ramikins about 1/4\" to the top. Will definitely be making this again!!",
