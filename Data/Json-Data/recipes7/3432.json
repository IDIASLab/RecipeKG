It's the perfect recipe if you're in a hurry or you need to make a lot of pies. I baked mine in a glass dish with a baking sheet underneath to catch the excess drippings. It baked up nice and tasted great - especially with vanilla ice cream! Thanks for a great recipe Lisawas! And thanks to everyone at AR for letting my niece Kailey and I participate in the President's Pie Challenge for the Thanksgiving webcast! We had a great time! As my niece put it one of the best parts was getting to eat the pie at the end!!!",

Instead of all sugar used 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 c Splenda granular (this is the Splenda that is cup for cup equivalent of sugar). No need to add extra water or liquid. Suggestion: If you have time mix all pie ingredients together in a bowl and leave on the counter for about 10 minutes to let the cherries thaw slightly and absorb tapioca before you bake. I always do this when baking any type of fruit pie and using tapioca and it seems to produce better/tastier pies. If you don't have time charge ahead and get baking! My husband called for his mother and rolled his eyes back in his head over this one!:)",
