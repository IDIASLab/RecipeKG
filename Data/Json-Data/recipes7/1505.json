Many would-be tapioca cooks shy away from cooking tapioca for that very reason. I would also recommend cooking on medium rather than medium high to avoid scalding which is very easy to do. Slow cooking is always better than scalded. I love this with a spoonful of fruit preserves on top or fresh fruits of the season even better. The tartness of fresh fruit makes the tapioca seem sweeter by contrast. I also advise being sure the tapioca balls are soft taste test before removing from heat but try to remove from cooking before it is fully thick. It will thicken a great deal more in the refrigerator. Tapioca Pudding is a great comfort food treat and this shines so far more than the fake stuff sold in little plastic cups no contest! It is not difficult at all but like good cooking always does it requires the attention of a loving cook. I have made this 5 times always with non-instant tapioca.",
