I did make some changes: I substituted the buttermilk with plain yogurt, the white sugar for brown, and shortening for margarine (trying to make them even more healthy). I also opted for blueberries rather than the raisins.  I loved how moist they were inside, with a nice crust on top, and they expanded really nicely.  I did think that the molasses taste was a little strong for me, and I like molasses, but after serving them at my 2 \u00bd year old\u2019s play date, both the kids and moms really liked the flavour.  I think next time I will half the molasses and put some applesauce in and see how it works.  Definitely a great, high-fiber snack for kids and adults alike!",

I used spelt bran; let any bran soak for a few minutes in the bowl of wet ingredients so it's nice and moist coming out of the oven. I also used a buttermilk/yogurt combo, and a healthy oil because I hate measuring solid shortening. If you are not a bran muffin purist (mine is in a loaf), I recommend adding an additional cup of dried fruit (apricots, prunes) and nuts. Oh, and I like molasses so I increased to 1/3 cup. Good!",

I increased the baking soda to 2 teaspoons and the buttermilk to 1 3/4 cups. I also added 1t of vanilla 1t of cinnamon 1/2t ginger clove nutmeg. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

Being on the healthy and frugal side here is the substitution I made instead of using white sugar and molases: I had in the fridge some \"fiber bomb\" (I'll post recipe right away) which is dried fruit simmered in plain water until they turn syrupy. I measured the fruit syrup to 3/4 cup and chopped 1/2 cup of the fruit right on the dry ingredients and tossed (or they would drop to the bottoms of the muffins during baking).
