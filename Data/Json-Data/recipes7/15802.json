I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the oats with 3/4 of a cup of steel cut and used smart balance instead of butter to stay away from cholesterol, and one gram of stevia instead of the sugar. I used a processor for the dry ingredients for sake of ease, then put into a bowl and cut the smart balance in with a shortening cutter. I used 3/4 a cup of hot water (steel cut oats are not processed with steam) then rolled out with a rolling pin and used a biscuit cutter. I did use modern technology but most have been in the family for 100 years (not the processor though).",
