I used 2 cups of sugar free frozen berries (defrosted) and followed the recipe as written. No need to change anything! I don't have an ice cream maker but I knew my Ninja Pro could make ice cream. I probably should have checked out their site first as it would have saved me some time perhaps. After letting the mixture cool in the fridge I poured it into ice cube trays and put them in the freezer. Once frozen popped the cubes in the Ninja and pulsed away. Poured/spread it into a cold bread pan and popped it in the freezer. Glad I did make it this way though to get the seeds out. This is going to be even better for a nice treat in the coming weeks when my fruit loving hubs gets 5 teeth removed! Thank you for the recipe Shorecook!",
