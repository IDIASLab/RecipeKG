I baked them 13 minutes and they were perfectly done. Despite having no oil or butter they were very moist and had a very nice texture. I'm sure no one would be able to tell they were gluten free. The only thing I would do differently is to spray the paper cupcake liners with Pam because they did stick a little. I'm sure I'll make these again.",
