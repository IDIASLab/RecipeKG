I would use 350 degree oven as it was near burning after 50 minutes.\nThe topping is good, but falls off when you cut the cake.  I would recommend stirring the coconut and pecans from the topping into the batter itself, then preparing the glaze part of the topping only.  Skewer the cake before you apply the glaze so it sinks in.  This way you still have all the \"jamaican\" elements, and the glaze really is quite tasty.\nThe cake itself was moist and had a nice texture, so I may refer to this idea of using cream cheese in the future on other banana bread recipes.",

Also, I recommend baking at 350 degrees.  At 375 it got too brown and the baking time was too long.  I pulled out of the oven after 50 minutes when I noticed how brown it was and it probably would have been better if I'd caught it 5 minutes earlier.  Next time I'll bake it at 350 and watch it close towards the end.  I didn't bother to toast the pecans and I don't think it made much of a difference and it was easier.  I will definitely make again with these changes.",

She had most of the ingredients on hand so I gave it a try! I had to substitute walnuts for the pecans and I had to double the brown sugar and butter for the topping to make enough to cover both of the loaves. She was so impressed as we all were! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",

I then thought why not pinapple and make it more like a pina colada bread it was mine and my dad's favorite of the two. I then mixed the left over banana and the left over pinapple recipe and made what I called a Hawaiian bread. I will make all versions again. I used the regular coconut on the inside and the large flake on the topping it made for a nice appearance.",
