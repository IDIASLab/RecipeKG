The sauce ingredients seemed kind of odd to me at first but they made a nice flavored sweet and sour ketchup sauce. I used lean ground beef and low-fat milk and it didn't seem to be a problem. The meatballs ended up being giant! The 12 meatballs equalled 4 scoops with a standard cookie scoop. Clean-up was fairly easy to. I ended up using a 13x9 disposable pan leftover from the last holiday and putting it on a sheet pan. The recipe makes lots of sauce. I ate it with some litely buttered rice from the rice cooker and a small salad. One meatball with sides easily filled me up. TY",

I also used cornstarch to thicken it since I took the stove-top shortcut. I was very skeptical of the sauce but it turned out fantastic. It was absolutely perfect with the meatballs and served over rice. I've done different recipes before and they were too sweet that even my kids wouldn't eat it. The tomato sauce really mellowed it out.",
