Also when stirring toward the end the whisk will start to make lines in the custard showing it\u2019s thicker, that is when to take it off the heat. I left mine on a little too long and it got sorta curdled looking as if the eggs were cooking. To keep it smooth looking he sure to take it off before this happens. I added some pumpkin pie and nutmeg spices as well as good vanilla. Pretty tasty.",

I had a bunch of tapioca pearls and needed something to put them in so I started researching custard recipes (which by the way tapioca pearls in custard is delicious). Chai custard is genius! What I had was powdered instant chai mix from Costco so I used that and added it as the sugar into the egg yolks instead of steeping bags in the milk. The only tricky thing about this recipe is the actual custard-making which is just finicky so if you can manage making a good custard you should absolutely try making a chai one!!",
