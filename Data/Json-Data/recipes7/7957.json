I showed this recipe to a pastry chef to get some extra tips. She said to make it the day before let the dough rise, or cinnamon rolls rise for as long as I wanted, longer then 90 min to get big. Then put in freezer to freeze overnight and then take out in the morning and put into the oven frozen to bake. She said baking frozen pastries makes all the difference. It sure did... so good even my picky mother-in-law who\u2019s a professional baker loved them. There were no leftovers",

I Only did so because the bread recipe I was making from this site said it made 3 loafs (Grandma VanDoren's) and it is just DH & myself. WOW!!! In the beginning I THOUGHT I had everything but way too late realized I did not have cream...so...I mixed some liquid French Vanilla coffee creamer with some 1/2 & 1/2 (and still added the vanilla extract) up at the last minute. Hey, what can I say? They were freaking awesome! On a personal note just for myself, I won't worry about nuts next time... even though I loved this with them... it is still an extra expense  that could be left out without compromising the flavor. AND even though I thought pouring the creamy mixture over them before baking sounded strange it was spot on!! I will try making another cinnamon roll recipe on this site but have a feeling nothing could be as good as this one. I feel as if I have to try baking another one just so I know for certain that this is THE ONE to use. I will of course post an update later. That being said, I won't use baking bread as an excuse to try my hand at cinnamon rolls ever again. SO 4.75 Big gold stars from me!",

I also do not drizzle the rolls with frosting. They are sweet and YUMMY just as they are out of the oven.",
