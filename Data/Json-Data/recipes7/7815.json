I followed the sauce recipe exactly except used chicken broth instead of mirin (not a staple in my kitchen).  And the only other changes I made were using one less breast and adding shrooms and onions.  One tip, which others have also suggested, use low-sodium soy sauce.  It was pretty salty and I added no salt to the meat or veg when sauteeing.  I also did this on the stovetop instead of in the oven.  I will definitely make this one again!",

To us, and we're ginger lovers, and it turned out to be a perfect amount.  Didn't have the sweet wine but used Rice wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp. sugar. We loved it, grandkids have asked for it since and their mom asked for the recipe because the kids were asking for her to make it at home.  Very tasty, served with Asian style sticky rice, steamed broccoli and the end result was perfect!!  MANY thanks!!",
