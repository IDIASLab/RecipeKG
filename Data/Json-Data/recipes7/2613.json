I also used  1/2 C milk chocolate chips and 1 C. semi sweet chips, and dusted the pan with unsweetened coco pwdr.  I have a gluten intolerance and only use Ghiradelli as Hershey's is difficult to get an answer about allergies.  Hope this is helpful.",

For all those reviewers who are giving this recipe 1/5 stars, you must NOT be following the recipe correctly.  It actually upsets me reading the negative reviews.  How is possible to be biting into a bean? You are supposed to be blending the beans into a smooth mixture via a food processor! How is it dry? The recipe calls for 4 eggs! Grainy? Again, mix via food processor to a smooth consistency and wash the beans thoroughly beforehand.  Not sweet enough or chocolately enough? Are you using the correct measuring spoons?! Anyone who follows this recipe to the exact T should be successful in making a delicious cake.  If you have a good quality food processor, a non stick baking pan, and you know how to read and follow instructions, this cake will turn out fantastic.  Good luck!",

To make a coconut version: 1)Omit the chocolate chips. 2)Add one can of coconut milk. 3) Add a bag of dried coconut. 3) Increase the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups. 4) Add 1/4 tsp of salt. 6) 1 tsp of vanilla. 5)I like to top it with coconut frosting from the baking aisle of the store.

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe.  Served it to 7 people & they all liked it.  My 12 year old daughter had 2 pieces.    I processed the beans ALOT & it was pretty smooth.  No one could taste the beans @ all but felt good about the fact that they were eating a dessert that was actually good for them.  We thought it was sweet enough, my sister in Law who is a health nut thought it was too sweet but she hates sweets altogether but it was fun to see her enjoying her cake & not feel guilty about it.  The only change I made was to put in more baking powder, added 1 tsp. vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white.  I will only add the stated amount of baking powder next time as I feel it will be better not being so airy.    The cake does look dry but then when eating it surprisingly it doesn't taste dry.  Kinda crumbly (but no one minded) so next time I will try adding some applesauce or butter or maybe even some Peanut butter.  Chocolate chips or chunks, nuts would also be good in it.    Really make sure by poking in the center as to when the cake is truly done.  Mine took longer to cook than stated.  This Recipe will be used over & over again, with variations as to additions and toppings, as a cake & as cupcakes. \n\nUPDATE Made it again, this time added toasted whole almonds as the food processor will chop them.  Added 1/3 cup applesauce  & a 1/4 cup coconut oil.  Wow it was perfect.  More fudgy tasting, less crumbly & the nutty bits were a nice treat.  Raspberries & dollop of cream on top perfect!",

I didn't have very high hopes for baked goods without gluten, but when I read all the great reviews for this recipe, I thought I should try it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I felt like it was lacking something; the texture was fine, but it wasn't sweet enough or rich enough or...something.  I won't make this one again, and I'll keep looking for other recipes for gluten-free deserts.",
