Like the previous reviewer I didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla extract. The next time I make this recipe (and you better believe there will be a next time) I will sprinkle the almonds over the filling instead of mixing them in - cutting down on some of the crunch. HAPPY PI DAY! Thanks for the recipe this one is a keeper!",
