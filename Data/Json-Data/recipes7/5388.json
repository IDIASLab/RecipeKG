I don't make waffles that much so I don't worry about it! Add couple drops of food coloring to the batter. Red and green food colors for the holidays. Orange for Halloween, pink and red for Valentine's Day, green for St. Patrick's Day, red and blue for Fourth of July, Memorial Day and Labor day! Optional, dust with confectioners powdered sugar.",

Failed to look 'cute' though.\" I will describe the appearance of my waffles as \"Goblin-with-a-Suntan\" as the slight amount of the food coloring called for (which incidentally I doubled) coupled with the natural browning of the waffle batter turned my breakfast a well sickly shade of celadon. (I'll stick w/ a 4-star rating based on it being a tasty waffle.) After a good chuckle and some syrup I ate the waffles but decided that a holiday-themed breakfast might be better suited for something other than the addition of food coloring to batter - maybe green M&M's in regular waffles.",

I made the batter without the coloring removed a small amount and added about 5 drops of red coloring. This resulted in pink waffles.
