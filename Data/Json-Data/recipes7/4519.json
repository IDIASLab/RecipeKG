I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would change is add nuts next time.  It did take more cooking time (about 30 minutes) but that could have been because my butter was cold from the fridg.  I'll warn you...this makes a lot.  I poured it into two 9x13 cookie sheets.  The peanut butter addition really made this special.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I'm a first time fudge maker and a few things happened that I'm not sure were supposed to: 1) Because of the large quantities of ingredients in this recipe I used my cheapo stock pot so I would have room to accomodate everything. Even though I turned the heat down to medium low and stirred constantly my butter/milk kept scortching. 2) There was no way that after I had squished the fudge into the 13x9 pan room temp peanut butter was going to incorporate itself into the fudge no matter how much knife swirling I did. I melted the peanut butter in the microwave poured it over the top and then swirled it in. It tastes delightful upon initial sampling and once I cut it up a little more I'll let you know how it holds together",

It is so easy to make compared to other candy recipes I've tried it feels almost like cheating - I just made a half-batch in about 10 minutes yesterday while entertaining my 7 month old. I'm a bit of a fudge snob so I was surprised how good it is - really creamy. I made it without the peanut butter and it's still good - I used Hershey's and am going to try it with Ghirardelli next time since I'm guessing it might be even better - but awesome either way.

Since you need to work quickly I recommend mixing your chocolate chips candy marshmallow etc. together in a large bowl while your butter sugar and evaporated milk is heating. Then just add the entire bowl of ingredients to the pot in one shot.",
