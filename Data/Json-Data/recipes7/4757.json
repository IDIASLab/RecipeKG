SO EASY and very tasty. Couldn't even taste the twinkie. I will certainly make a large pan for a party. As you can see in the photos I put it in a small glass pan so it looked like a traditional tiramisu. This is a real winner. Taste just like tiramisu. I made it last night and had a piece for breakfast by the pool. MMMMM breakfast of champions. This could be one more reason that I am not bikini ready LOL Thanks Witchywoman. YUMMY!",

I didn't have any mascarpone so I used the 'Mascarpone Substitute' recipe from here. Also I am afraid of raw eggs so I omitted the egg yolk. Just to make it look more 'classy' I dusted the top with cocoa powder. Tiramisu is one of my all-time favorite desserts and I really enjoyed this fun twist on it! Thanks WW for such a fun and delicious recipe that I know I'll be making again!:)",

                "reviewBody": "Mmmm! SO yummy.:) Since my main entree was quite labor-intensive I opted for an easy dessert. Not wanting anything too basic (and needing a dessert I could serve with an Italian-themed holiday meal) I decided on Witchywoman's tiramisu. Not only was this delicious it took no time flat to prepare (unlike traditional tiramisu). To boot my ingredient list was short AND inexpensive and the ingredients were easy to find! As with any recipe I think there is room for improvision. Here are my two suggestions: a) Use pasteurized eggs. They are safe to eat raw (I just can't bring myself to eat raw eggs!) and b) Serve at room temperature. This is my opinion but if you think about it tiramisu is never served cold from the fridge (at least not any tiramisu I've had). For a pretty presentation I served my tiramisu \"parfait-style\" in pretty wine glasses sprinkled with cocoa and garnished with fresh mint. I think next time (there WILL be a next time!) I'm going to use ladyfingers instead of Twinkies tho.... I want to see if I like them better (the Twinkies are a neat idea but I think I'd prefer to subsitute them next time). Thanks for sharing your creative recipe withcywoman! My dinner guests (parents) give this a thumbs-up. I have yet to convince my hubby he MUST try this again (my way) but that doesn't mean I won't make another attempt to change his mind lol!:-)",
