This definitely helped my craving! I substituted almond milk in place of cows and agave for the sugar. I added a pinch of salt cinnamon and vanilla. The texture is still very different from regular pancakes but I was able to get used to it after a couple of bites. Thanks for the recipe. Update: When I made this the second time I mixed the ingredients slightly different and the outcome was a very fluffy pancake! I used the same substitutions as stated above but made these changes: heated my skillet first mixed dry and wet ingredients separately then added the wet ingredients on top of the dry only mixed about 10 times with a whisk til it was just barely combined then immediately scooped onto my skillet. This texture was more like regular pancakes than when I tried to mix it with the electric mixer.",
