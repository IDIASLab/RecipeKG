I was out of scallions which would have helped a lot and I chose not to bother with the almonds. I added two shredded carrots did use the garlic and used only 1/2 tsp pepper. Not bad but the sesame oil was too overpowering. I ended up using another Tbsp each of sugar and vinegar to try to counteract the oil. If I make it again will use 1 T. sesame oil and 1 T. canola with the same amt. of other ingredients.",

I personally like using red cabbage because it makes a really pretty salad and I have added julienned carrots and it looked and tasted great. I've also added cucumber which is also tasty. I followed some other reviews and used honey as opposed to sugar and it tasted really nice. Don't skip out on toasting the sesame seeds - it really gives it that nutty flavour. The dressing is really versatile too I've contemplated using it for other salads and it would probably be tasty with shrimp. This is my favourite cabbage recipe thank you for posting!",
