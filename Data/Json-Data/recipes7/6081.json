I recommend this with the silken tofu instead of milk - it adds protein to a fiber-rich soup, and no one will know it's there if you don't tell them!

Maybe that is a cup; I don't know. I doubled all the spices and used some hot sauce instead of a chili. The essential recipe was the same and it was delicious.",

Instead of tumeric\\coriander\\black pepper I used curry powder which has all of these ingredients. Instead of butter I used Smart Balance spread. I ended up using 8 cups of vegetable broth made with vegetable bullion. At the time I searched in vein for fresh thyme but ended up using 1 1/2 teaspoons of powdered thyme. I ended up using a \"stick\" blender which saved on clean-up up! Now to the result: a roomate who works as a cook was surprised how tasty it was! I just had a few bowlfuls of it: it's VERY tasty! Goes great with some crusty bread like French or Italian. VERY VERY VERY Addicting!! 5 stars it needs to have more!",
