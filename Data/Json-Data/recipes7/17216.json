We used 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper, added 2 extra cloves of garlic (3 cloves total), 1/4 tsp thyme, and 1/2 tsp sage but it was still more sweet than savory.  The coconut flavor was strong and the soup was sweet.  We substituted 1 hubbard squash in place of the 3 butternut squash because that's what we had on hand.  This made 12 bowls of soup - TWICE what was expected based on the \"6 servings\" listed.",
