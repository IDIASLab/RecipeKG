This is a very flexible recipe. You can substitute any fresh herbs you have on hand for the chives and tarragon, vary the nuts used, use golden raisins or dark. We've made this recipe many different ways and I've yet to discover a variation we didn't like!",

I used my lemon olive oil for the oil but then later I was thinking that my blood orange olive oil would have made it even better---so next time.
