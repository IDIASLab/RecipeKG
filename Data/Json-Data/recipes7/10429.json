I made it exactly as written (except for using parchment paper instead of wax paper to line the cookie sheet - it works great).  I only had slivered almonds, I think it would be even better with whole almonds, and I think I will try it with cashews and macadamias too!  It is fairly greasy on your hands, but that doesn't bother me.  The directions are good (I didn't time the minutes, just stirred constantly until it was a good color.  Be prepared - once it is done you must pour it out immediately.  It cools and hardens very quickly (less than 30 minutes on a cold November afternoon in New York).  The biggest plus is not having to deal with massive amounts of corn syrup and candy thermometers!",

This can also be made with chocolate chips - just let the brittle set up and then scatter the chips over the top of the still hot brittle and spread them out with a spatula. \n\nFor the people whose recipe separated - two possible causes are that the heat was too low or that there was too much butter added and it prevented the sugar from caramelizing. (I know this last one because I did it once myself - delicious crumbly results, but not brittle.)",
