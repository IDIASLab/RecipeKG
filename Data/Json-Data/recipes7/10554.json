It's a very dense cake, like a brownie and small pieces are very filling.  I didn't tell them until after dinner that it was made from a can of beans. :-)\n\nNext time I think I\"ll double the recipe and bake it in a springform pan so that I can more easily remove it from the pan and also so that it will bake more evenly.  Baking it in the square pan did result in more hardened corners which can be great for brownies but not so great for cakes.  Baking it in the springform pan will also allow it to more easily be removed to frost it on all sides.  It did kind of crumble while trying to remove the first pieces from the square pan.",
