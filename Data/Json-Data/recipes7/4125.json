At least one of the reviews was saying it was hard to blend and they had a good blender. I looked at the ingredient list and did not see a liquid and knew I would have the same trouble so I added 3/4 of a cup of orange juice and then had no problem. I left out the kiwi because I don't care for it. The ingredient I accidentally forgot was the pineapple and it still tasted good. I used store bought shredded carrots per that reviewers suggestions also. I had to use a frozen banana cut up because it was what I had. I ended up adding a packet of Truvia because it seemed like it needed a little sweetening and I don't say that often. Overall even though I tweaked it the final result was good and like another reviewer said it was a great way to hide in a vegetable!",

For those that would be using a standard blender perhaps grating the carrot will help. The tartness of the kiwi helps to balance the sweetness from the apple. I like that this does not include added sugar the fruits make it sweet enough.",
