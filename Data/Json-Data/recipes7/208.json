The instructions missed the bacon fat which was in the ingredient list (I remembered to include it).  It was very good - a thick, melt-in-your mouth, hot dog \"tempura!\"  In my second batch, I replaced the corn meal with crushed Onion Flavored Sun Chips, reduced the salt by half, and added 1 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp onion powder.  The sugar in the recipe cooks the batter very fast, so I used room-temperature hot dogs before dipping it into the batter.  An A.B. TIP: Put batter into a glass for easier dipping.  The resulting flavors were exciting and surprising!  When deep frying, they didn't want to flip to cook the other side, so I weighed them down with a perforated disk.  So wonderful!  Perfect shape, texture and taste.  TRY THIS, FOLKS!",

The best tasting batter I have EVER made.  It has to be the buttermilk and baking soda that makes the difference.  Roby, all you need are a few helpful hints and you will be ready for the county fair. :)  1.  To keep the batter from sliding off the wieners, dust them with flour before putting them in the batter.  The flour acts as a glue for the batter. 2.  Put the batter in a tall glass...you can dip the wiener down into it.  3. As you are pulling the wiener from the batter, gently twirl the stick. This helps keep the batter on, too.  It's all about keeping the batter neatly coating the wiener!!  4.  The last trick is...(and you have to work sort of fast...) When you take the corndog out of the batter and put it in the hot grease, hold it upright, put it about 2 inches down in the grease and hold it about 3 seconds, then carefully drop it in the grease.  I'm not sure what this does but it works like a charm and my corn dogs never split open.  Okay!  That's it.  Time to eat the corn dogs I just made.  I already had the best looking corn dogs in the state...now I have the best tasting, too!!!  Thanks.",

We used veggie dogs and omitted the bacon drippings and made sure the dogs were at room temperature before dusting with corn starch and dipping in the batter. Pulling them out of the batter with a twisting motion worked beautifully to keep the batter on the dog. As soon as I put one in the deep fryer my husband dove in with tongs and pulled them up from the bottom of the fryer by the stick so they wouldn't adhere to the fryer basket. We drained these on a rack over a paper towel lined pan and kept them warm in a 200 degree oven until all were finished. We ate these with traditional yellow mustard slathered on with a brush just like they did it at the local corn dog stand when I was a child. Hot diggedy corn dogs! These are just the BEST.",
