I added thin sliced grilled pork meat because that's my favorite combination but of course you can just put shrimp by itself. the dipping sauce is not quite the same as the one in my favorite Vietnamese restaurant but it is good. My advice is to adjust the herbs to your preference don't use something you don't like because their flavor will come up quite clear in your palate (not subtle like when they are cooked into something).",

So much that the last one got eaten at 8am for breakfast as we were going away and couldnt stand the thought of wasting it!  I subbed oyster sauce for fish sauce, and scallops for shrimp, that's what I had on hand.  YUM.  Also made it  again with matchstick carrots and diced red pepper instead of the shrimp, very good.
