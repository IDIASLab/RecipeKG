I am giving it four stars because both times I baked it, it was not done at one hour.  The first one fooled me with the toothpick test and when I removed it from the pan, it was like a lava cake!  Hence my making it a second time . And yes, the second time was baked through, and took 1 hour 15 at 350. It is a delightful cake!\nThank you for sharing the recipe!",
