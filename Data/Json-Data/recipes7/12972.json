I couldn't resist so I added in some vanilla extract for flavor. The batter is pretty thick but these bake up beautifully. A little dry but I may have over-baked by a minute or 2 (they weren't done @ 12 minutes so I baked them about 3-4 mins. more but will check sooner next time). I frosted these w/ a vanilla buttercream...the family is happy so that's good enough for me! Thanks for sharing.:)",

                "reviewBody": "There is something hugely wrong in the suggested number of cupcakes this recipe is supposed to make. I wanted to make only 6 to try it out. The reduced batter filled the muffin cups barely even 1/4 full. I had to make more batter to get 6 decent sized cupcakes. Also a the batter was so thick I added a little coconut milk maybe a 1/3 c all told. They also took almost double the time to cook. Working with such small amount of batter I didn't bother separating the ingredients as per directions - just put it all together in the bowl and beat it up. Bottom line it's a really nice recipe with a lovely crispy crunchy top nice fluffy interior quite tasty. I don't think they really need icing but without icing they look like cornmeal muffins. I would make these again and repeat the single step method. Couldn't be easier - or tastier. Update: next day the crispy topping is gone but it's still a really nice cupcake. I might add a 1/4 tsp vanilla next time. This may become my go-to cupcake recipe.",
