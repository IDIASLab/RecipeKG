So, I would always ask her to make her cookies, and when she refused, I would take out the vanilla and sit it next to me with the cap open, so that I could breathe the aroma. My mother get a kick out of this, and said, well, if it's that important, we'll add a little vanilla kick, just for you. After the first time she put the vanilla in, there was never a last...it became a tradition.",

                "reviewBody": "Perfect! I make this every weekend! I use 3 whole eggs. Tips: Sift your flour or use a sieve when the batter is done. This will take out the flour chunks for a smoother consistency. Also measure the flour by using a spoon to pour it into the cup. If you scoop a measuring cup, it packs the flour and you get a doughy crepe.  Find the right temp! When you first pour the batter, it shouldn't wrinkle too much when spreading, or your pan is too hot. No dalmation spotted crepes!   Technique! Pour your batter on a very lightly greased pan (short spray of Pam is fine) You know you're ready to flip it when the edges begin to curl, the middle batter isn't glossy and wet looking, and you can shake the pan to move the crepe.  Use a large thin spatula, flip, and cook another 15 seconds. Pick up the pan and slide the crepe onto a plate. When you're ready to make another crepe, don't set your pan on the burner for more than a few seconds, or it gets too hot. 1/3 c. for a 9\" skillet is perfect.  I serve mine with strawberry compote and cottage cheese. Yum!  LOW FAT: You can sub the butter for margarine, the sugar for a zero calorie sweetener (Truvia or Splenda taste best), and even replace yolks with egg whites or Egg Beaters. ",

Some pecans added to the crepes with this filling give it a good texture and a little bit nuttier flavor.  \n\nBest crepes I've ever had with the small changes.",
