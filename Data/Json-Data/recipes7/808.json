I found that if the fritters were fried to just a golden brown they were a little soft so I let them fry a little longer to a medium brown. This made them crispier when they cooled down and they were just as tasty. Thanks for this great recipe!",

When frying I recommend only a medium flame so that the outside slowly browns while the inside has time to cook. The center should still be soft but not mushy. Also I like eating these with some powedered sugar sprinkled on top. Overall I recommend this recipe!",

I was looking for another way to use them without the usual banana bread. I'm not a big fan of frying because of all the grease but this recipe was WONDERFUL! Ok I found that I was out of Baking Powder and I added a few drops of vanilla extract and fried a little longer because I wanted them not as soggy. They came out wonderful! I added some powered sugar on the top to garnish also. It was a BIG hit at our house!",
