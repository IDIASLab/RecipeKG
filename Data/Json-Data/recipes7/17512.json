Suspect even those who don't enjoy liver might change their minds after tasting this on homemade crackers, toast, or bagels. I like it for light summer lunches or as an appetizer. The reduced bourbon/vermouth deglazing step adds an adult zing that rocks my world. Garnish with fresh herb sprigs or cucumber slices.",
