The only thing I wasn't sure of was when I creamed the coconut oil and the sugar some of the coconut oil was globby. Just here and there; mixed it for a long time but finally just gave up with some globs here and there. It didn't seem to affect the cookie. I also used an all purpose gluten free flour and with the strong sweet flavors of the cookie the weird after taste in GF flour was completely gone. Thanks for a nice easy recipe to satisfy my sweet craving.",

Instead of white sugar I used Splenda which I use instead of white sugar. Used butterscotch and peanut butter chips had no chocolate chips (bad as I'm a chocolate fiend). Found the the batter very thick hard on beater so tried by spatula but scooped with cookie scoop. They were too dry to stay together but cooked anyway. They were same colour and tasty but looked nasty as they wouldn't stay together. If I makes these again I am going to put them in mini cupcake pans.",
