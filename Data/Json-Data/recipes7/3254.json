Kernel corn really dresses up the salad in addition to the red pimentos - yummy AND pretty. Instead of worchestershire sauce I add a 'shot' of balsamic vinegar and give the salad some zing with finely sliced/chopped red onion that I soak first in cold water and then squeeze out liquid. This technique is great for sweeting the red onion. Thanks for the recipe!!",
