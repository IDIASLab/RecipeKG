This last time I added about 1/4 c more flour and stuck the sheets in the freezer before baking but to no avail. I even stuck them all back in the oven to hopefully crispen them up but that didn't work either. That being said these taste so wonderful even though they were wimpy I ended up just folding them in half so they weren't so messy. Taste gets at least 5 stars because they are delicious but there is something wrong that they just totally flatten out but yet don't get crispy at all...",
