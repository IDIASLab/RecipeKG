I whipped up the whole lot in the cuisinart to break down the oats (hubby doesn't like any hint of \"nutrition\" in his food) and added a little more flour to compensate. I stirred in the berries by hand. Next time I will substitute cucumber puree for the applesauce to add a little hidden green to his diet.",
