The key to Korean fried rice is to use one-day-old, leftover rice; freshly cooked rice causes the fried rice to be sticky and soggy in texture. I usually present this dish on a square plate. Garnish with green onions, cherry tomatoes, sesame seeds, and cilantro to bring color and provide an extra visual of texture and crunch.",
