I skipped the olives and artichokes per personal preference and the eggs because I'm lazy;) I thought it might pack a bit more of a punch given the dressing ingredients but nothing really made it stand out from the usual pasta salad fare. It's a nice pasta salad for sure but not one I can say for sure I'd make again (though it's certainly worth YOU giving it a try; it's good stuff!). THANKS for the recipe!",
