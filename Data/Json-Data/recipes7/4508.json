I had an extra cup of sauce left because I only made two pizzas. The dough ended up taking 7 cups flour plus extra to knead to keep from getting sticky. Alternate the toppings to fresh zucchini and mushrooms from the farm. And BBQ chicken yum!!!",

We use \"Irish garlic sausage\" that we feel tastes much better on pizza. We get this in the sausage section of our local grocery store that is a nationwide store.",
