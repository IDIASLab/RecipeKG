But I think it helped out the flavor so would suggest it.\n\nI had trouble rolling the dough into one large log as it was cracking. Not sure if I should have let the dough absorb the flour more before rolling or I had the ratios slightly off, so I cut the log in half and had one good log and one disaster log that I had to remix and reroll. (But both still tasted great!)\n\nAfter chilling the dough for a bit over 2 hours I cut and placed on a parchment lined sheet. 12 minutes was perfect and as the cookies cooled I mixed confectioner's sugar with a bit of milk to make the glaze. The glaze really made the cookies more special and added a bit more sweetness to the intensity of the cinnamon layers. I would absolutely make these again since my family loved them!",

Like another reviewer, I added vanilla extract to the dough (1 1/2 tsps), but kept everything else the same. They are a simple, buttery, cinnamony-sugar flavor with a nice chewy texture. I could see where adding a glaze would take them over the top! Thank you for the recipe!",

I do suggest refrigerating for a bit before making the rectangle to make it easier to roll up. I didn't refrigerate before rolling and the dough did not roll tightly which was worrisome. After chilling and cutting the sliced rolled dough was loose. However, they baked up beautifully. 10 minutes was plenty for my oven. Next time I would follow the suggestions of other reviewers and add a confectioners sugar glaze. While being nice looking cookies the flavor and texture didn't wow me.",
