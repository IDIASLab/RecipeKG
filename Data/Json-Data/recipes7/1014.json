First of all, I used the \"Basic Flaky Crust\" recipe on this site for the crust, but I used 1 1/2 of the recipe for the bottom crust. I used 6 oz. of fresh blackberries instead of raspberries, and I mashed about 1/3 of the blackberries in a separate bowl. Then I added the sugar, cinnamon, and 1 TB of cornstarch (instead of flour) to the mash, and whisked the mixture until incorporated. After filling the pie crust with the rest of the peaches and blackberries, I drizzled the blackberry mash/cornstarch/sugar/cinnamon mixture over the top, put 4 1-TB pats of butter on top before covering with the top crust. Finally, I used an egg wash over the top of the crust, and sprinkled some sugar on top as well, baking as directed. The result was a decadent, delicious pie that was half eaten almost before it cooled! Great recipe that I will use again and again...",

Everyone at the party absolutely adored them and I got tons of requests for the recipe. I mixed the filling ingredients together and let them soak while rolling out the pie crusts. Then I scooped the filling into the crusts leaving a lot of the juices behind which I saved for topping ice cream. The pie wasn't soggy at all. It was gone before anyone could get seconds and I can't wait to hit the farmer's market again so I can make another pie! Thank you so much for this great recipe!",

I used dried cranberries that I added a little water to reconstitute, simmered them on the stove for about 10 minutes until they plumped up nicely, and added an extra tablespoon of sugar to sweeten them up a bit.  I added the plumped cranberries to the peaches, drained it since my peaches were VERY ripe, and I didn't want a soggy pie.  I added 2 tsp cornstarch to avoid any mushy filling.  The pie was superb!  The cranberries' tartness was a nice compliment to my super sweet peaches.  My husband (who doesn't like peaches) LOVED this pie, and so did I.  This recipe is really worth a try!",

Instead of sprinkling the top crust with sugar we used an egg wash. We didn't have plain frozen raspberries we used a strawberry/raspberry/blackberry frozen berry blend. Instead of cutting a vent in the top we cut a medium sized heart in the top crust before placing it over the pie. The baking time was a little off for us (we needed an extra 20 minutes) and I also tented our pie with foil so it wouldn't burn on the top. We haven't tried it yet it's cooling but I do have one thing to say about the pie--it's REALLY juicy. Like REALLY juicy. I don't know if it's because we used frozen berries/peaches but wow I was really surprized. I don't know that we'll use frozen fruit again. I did sneak a little of the juice from the pie and it seemed perfectly sweetened to me. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to cut into it. UPDATE: We really liked this pie but it was very wet. If I make this again I'll make sure to thaw the fruit out better before using it or add more flour OR I'll use fresh fruit. I want to try this again. Even with it's extra \"juice\" this was a hit with my family and my oldest boy called this one a win for the third pie he's made.",
