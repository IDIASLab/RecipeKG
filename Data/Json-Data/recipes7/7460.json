I have made muffins using bran cereal before--what I did was mix all the wet ingredients together and add the bran cereal to that and let it sit for 20 minutes. After that I folded in all the dry ingredients and the blueberries to be sure that the mixture would not be overmixed or the blueberries smashed. I baked my muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. This muffin was VERY moist with a nice chewy texture.",

Maybe I can modify this a little to correct that. I might try to find a way to add more blueberry juice for flavor without having the batter become too thin. I'm an amateur baker so maybe someone else will perfect this before I do! I would have given these a 2 but my husband really enjoyed them.",

When I added the cereal I simply let it sog for 10-15 minutes before continuing with the recipe. The kids loved it! (I'm sure the extra sugar from the cereal helped!) I also didn't have any juice so I just used the juice from the frozen berries I had put up. BTW this works great with cherries too! I made as mini muffins baked for 10-12 minutes. I will be making it again and again. Great way to use up the dregs! Waste not want not!",
