(wondering if some who had issues with this setting used regular pectin with only 3 cups of sugar?) At any rate, a few other changes I made was using fresh grated ginger instead of powdered and not marinating the peaches with the sugar. I followed the order on the box of pectin. Peaches, pectin, ginger, lemon juice combined and brought to full boil, add the sugar, bring to full boil again and boil for one minute stirring constantly. Added the Amaretto off heat. 1/3 cup was perfect for me. Ladel into jars and then follow this recipe the rest of the way. Cant wait to enjoy this over ice cream and on toast.",
