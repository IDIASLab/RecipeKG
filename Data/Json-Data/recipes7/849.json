Oh my, was this pie GOOOOOD!\nThe only changes that I made was that I thawed my blueberries in a saucepan and added two extra tablespoons of flour, since the reviewers were saying it was a little runny. I made the crust using the Butter Flake Pie Crust recipe on this site....(which I highly recommend).This pie was picture perfect! The next time I make it, we will refrain from woofing it down until my shutterbug daughter takes a photo to submit! Thank you so much! Yummm-OOOO!",

I added 2 tbs. of cornstarch to the mixture of dry ingredients for the filling. I think the consistency will be fine, once it cools. Since I had no lemon juice, I added a pinch of salt to the filling. \nNext time I'll probably try adding a little lemon juice , if I have some. \n\nI used 2 pints of fresh berries, which amounted to about 4 and 1/2 cups. This filled a deep pie plate. This is definitely a keeper.   Not only is it excellent, it's easy!",
