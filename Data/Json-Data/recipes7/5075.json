I changed the servings to 2 or half the recipe with the calculate button. The only change I made was subbing reduced fat milk and evaporated milk and 1 packet of Truvia for the sugar. My ice is not crushed so I went with 6 ice cubes for the 1 cup I needed. The only downside is I just wish evaporated milk came in smaller cans. I really dislike opening a can unless I am going to use it all. However I think it added some kind of a slight creaminess to the texture I don't normally get from just using milk in similar banana milk drinks. I also didn't add the cinnamon on top because I forgot. I thought it tasted fine without it.",
