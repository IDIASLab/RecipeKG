                "reviewBody": "The \"Cook's Notes\" states any sugar cookie base can be used so I used my favorite Holiday Butter Cookie recipe. These cookies are adorable and everyone loves them. Transferring the melted marshmallow is problematic. I experimented and discovered a better way to deal with the marshmallows. Bake and FREEZE your cookies. Take the frozen cookie and place the marshmallow near the edge and microwave until the marshmallow has puffed up. Do one at a time and watch closely. Occasionally one will fall and you will need to stop the microwave and place it back on. It may seem time consuming but it is actually MUCH faster than microwaving and transferring hot sticky marshmallows. Be sure to use FROZEN cookies as it ensures the cookies texture integrity is maintained. I also found I could make these ahead and freeze them. If any of the marshmallow heads have a sticky spot simply rub a touch of cornstarch on it problem solved. The marshmallow heads came out just as fresh from the freezer as they went in. Please note I used a freezer that is not self defrosting so it maintains a cold temperature rather than the self defrosting that has temps that fluctuate. Thanks for sharing this fun cookie.",
