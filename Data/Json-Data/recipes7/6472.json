For the glaze I used more than 1/2 a cup of strawberries and only about a cup of sugar. I usually don't make recipes from this site that have low ratings but I am glad I made these. Just a note - if you are using a regular cupcake pan this recipe will make 18-24 cupcakes not 12 like it states. I filled my cupcakes up to the top and ended up with a major muffin top. These store well unglazed. I kept them covered on the counter for a few days and felt they got better a day or two after they were baked. I just kept the glaze in the fridge and used it as needed (which I also felt got better a day or two after it was made). I will definitely make these again and experiment with different fruit glazes for the topping. Excellent - Five stars!!",

I chilled my glaze while the cupcakes cooled in order to make it a little bit easier to work with. I also added a little strawberry slice to the top of each cupcake for a little decoration.

A nice idea in theory but didn't execute well. I will DEFINTELY be using this cupcake recipe again perhaps with a strawberry frosting. A chocolate hazelnut frosting would also pair nicely with this cupcake.",
