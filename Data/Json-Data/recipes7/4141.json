I did NOT use high heat - kind of mediumish. About 15 minutes before dinner time, I put the crusts back on the grill, brownest side down for a couple of minutes, flipped 'em, and dressed them, closed the lid. Let 'em cook till cheese melted. Since a large crust would not manage easily (flipping, etc.), I made four small pizzas, about 10-12 inches out of a bread machine recipe that used 4 !/2 cups flour. That allowed me to make four different kinds of pizza (regular; meat lovers; vegetarian; and best of all, salsa, jalepeno, black olives, cheese). Cut them in 6 or 8 pieces so folks can try them all. Next on my list - Reuben pizza - recipe on this site. And dessert pizza. Don't be afraid of the grill. I even bake cakes, homemade mac and cheese, etc. on the grill (place long cooks and fragile stuff on pizza stone to break the direct heat). Maybe the best part of the grill is the cleanup (no dishes!)",

Just make it as you would normally and as a meat pocket flatten it out stuff it a bit seal and bake at 350. Takes about 20 or so minutes. But if you like the bread soft about 15. The crisper and harder longer. Rolls just into desired shape and size and bake. 15 min or longer depending how you like it. A little out there but I haven't bought bread for 2 weeks because of this. It's way cheaper and tastier for me to just make rolls or loaves out of this. Just throw in seeds or other things into it. It's great to not have to wait for it to rise. But I still make bread the old fashion way sometimes. It tastes way better. But if I don't have time this is a great replacement.",

I did make my dough ahead of time and left it in the fridge. About 20 minutes before I began grilling I took out the dough and let it thaw/rise a bit. I grilled this on my George Foreman (the panini press type) I just left the top up and then put it down during the last minute of cooking. It worked perfectly! I used this dough as the base for Chicken Fajita Grilled Pizzas (recipe also on this site) and it was such a perfect combination. I'll definitely be using this dough often.",
