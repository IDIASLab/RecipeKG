To change it a little since it's eaten so often I like to add slivered almonds or glazed walnuts or sunflower seeds. Also to add a little more veggie crunch I add thinly sliced cabbage...and it's oh so good! I've only added bacon a few times but we prefer it without. And for the dressing I found that an inexpensive light mayo is good but the red wine vinegar should be of good quality; makes a difference!:",
