                "reviewBody": "I've made kumquat marmalade for the past 3 years, but couldn't find my recipe.  This one was much easier than the others I've seen.  Most jellies/jams say to stay with the recipe's measurements, but because this has no added pectin I doubled the recipe.  It turned out great, but only produced 3 small jelly jars.  Next time I will quadruple.  I use the entire kumquat (except the seeds).  Your kumquats need to be fresh picked or can be kept in the refrigerator for probably up to a week.  They dry out quickly if left at room temperature.  This was the first year both my kumquat and my Meyer lemon tree produced, so I used them.  They are not as tart and substantially larger and juicier than storebought lemons which offset the tartness of my kumquats.  Some kumquats are sweeter, so you would want to use regular lemons with those.   I left out the spices, as I've tried spiced recipes in the past and didn't care for it.  It was so good, I'm ashamed and yet proud to say that my husband and I ate 2/3 of a jar the day I made this recipe.   Also, this recipe doesn't mention it, but if you want to store them in the cabinet, cover the filled jars with hot water, bring to a boil, and boil for 5-10 minutes.  Then remove.  After they cool, check to ensure they sealed by pressing in the center of the lid.  If it pops, it's not sealed and you would need to store that one in the refrigerator.",
