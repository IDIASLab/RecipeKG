Both my husband and I also felt that the white chocolate chips just didn't add anything to this--in fact, it detracted from the overall flavor. I think reducing the sugar amount drastically, leaving out the white chocolate chips, and maybe adding some lemon zest/juice to the fruit would make this more to our tastes. I also made the cobbler in 4 small ramekins instead of an 8x8\" pan, and they only needed to bake for 25 minutes. Doing it this way made for nice individual desserts to serve. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
