And I replaced the white and brown sugar with 2 cups of  stevia sugar baking blend. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla extract for extra flavor. The baking time was about 10 minutes longer. If you bake with gluten free flour, it's very important not to overbake, so put your muffins in the freezer for a quick cool-down after you have taken them out of the oven. If you just put them on the kitchen counter, they'll keep baking till they're cool, thus might dry out.",
