I found that the recipe doesn't actually give a size pan, so mine was a small bundt pan. I added more apricots too that when unmolded, showed the apricots up the sides as well as on top. The cake itself is very moist & I had more than enough for the size pan I used.  Easy enough to follow for my 12 yr old granddaughter. Everyone loved it for several days. I'd keep it refrigerated, then warm in micro for a short burst w/some vanilla ice cream to enjoy!",
