The egg prep really depends on the eggs you use.... We use nest fresh eggs and the trick is to place eggs in cold water with1/8 cup salt per qt. Of water.... Bring to full boil...remove from heat... Cover and let set for 17 minutes....place eggs in to ice cold water until chilled. This way the eggs are cooked through and pop right out of the shell. Yummy thank for sharing the recipe!",
