I used tapioca starch instead of corn starch, the eggs I added appeared to have cooked into little egg bits (I was a bit grossed out at the thought), then the pudding's consistency was a little too thick. Luckily, pouring in a little more water to the final product made normal and absolutely delicious!\n\nIf you experience the problems I did, perhaps mixing the sugar with the egg first could help as done in other puddings. Maybe letting the pot cool a bit first before adding the egg?\n\nBut overall, this pudding is completely worth making!",
