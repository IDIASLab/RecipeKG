The preparation method though let the taste down a lot. Instead of sauteing the onion and cauliflower next time i'll boil it in water. Then use the bullion for the soup instead of adding water or chicken broth. This way you preserve the flavour of the veggies the soup has a much better punch to it and the spices aren't that sharp. Not to mention it's healthier:)",
