The combination of chicken pineapple and rice (I used brown rice) seemed to be lacking in vegetables so after I made the soup I took out some of the broth put it in a small pan and simmered parsnips and celeric (cut into small cubes)in the covered pan until tender. I then added all into the soup and...voila! My husband pronounced it one of the best soups he's ever had. I think snow peas and bamboo shoots would be equally good but I didn't have those on hand.

I also diced and sauteed a yellow bell pepper and added it to the mix. Such a good addition! I let it sit on the stove for a couple hours which thickened it up like a stew and then added a little bit more chicken broth. I served it with pan-fried naan bread. Delicious!

For the chicken I threw in 2 chicken breast whole. When I got home I pulled out the chicken and shredded coursley w/a knife and returned it to the cooker; lastly I added the can of coconut milk and a can of sweet corn and served it immediately. It was the perfect consistency. My family raved about it and demanded it go in the \"keeper\" recipe book.",
