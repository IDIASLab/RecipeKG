I guess back in the day it was easier to say 1 egg to 1tbsp sugar to 1 cup milk to 1 cup flour. never heard of salt going in. And one major Norwegian recipe not included here was Cardamom.  All Norske's as far as I know put a heavy sprinkling of cardamom in the mix.  And all norskes roll this with strawberry jelly. Jordbear.  Oh yeah, they call it tinnepannekakke (thin pancake).  Here in the US we add some cinnamon and vanilla, but it's not neccessary.",

He thinks they are very excellent and can't wait for me to make these again.  I, too, thought them to be very tasty.  They were very easy to make(of course, you needed to overlook my inexperience at the flipping of them).  I added a dash of vanilla to the mix and then we smothered them with whipped brown sugar and cinnamon cream cheese, drizzled some maple syrup on the top, and sprinkled with powder sugar.  Great!

We've had these for breakfast two days in a row. :)\n\nCooking technique is important: We don't have a crepe pan so used a regular frying pan instead. The batter needs to be thinly spread or it doesn't cook through. \n\nWe made a side relish of peeled and diced apples and pears mixed with a little brown sugar and apple butter, then sauteed until soft. This was excellent with the pancakes and even better the second day. \n\n(Also used real maple syrup. Yum.) :)",
