I used a Fuji apple because that's what I always have around the house and regular raisins and plain Mott's applesauce (again, what I had.)  This turned out moist and delicious, plus it made my house smell heavenly.  It would be good with some nuts in it, too and I might try that next time.  My only issue was that I should have doubled it because we ate most of it while watching Sunday night football!  \nThis recipe rocks - I almost always have the ingredients in the house and it's super simple.  Will definitely make again!",
