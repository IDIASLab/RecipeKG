There is a lot of moisture in the batter so they continue to emit steam even when ready to come off the waffle maker which requires gently lifting the lid to test whether they will come out or need more time. Mine take considerably longer than the suggested time. I have made them as written but now I do it with a few tweaks. As written they are perfect but to keep things simple I use all olive oil and two whole eggs. I also like to use buttermilk. Tender crisp and full of delicious flavor. We leave out the nuts and serve with whipped cream and syrup. Heaven!",

I did make a few changes - replaced half of the flour with all-purpose flour used all canola oil instead of butter and olive oil and 2 whole eggs. Instead of adding the applesauce I just added another 1/2 cup pumpkin (using 1 cup pumpkin total and giving it more pumpkin oomph!). Loved the flavor and texture inside but they didn't turn out very crisp on the outside (no doubt because of my changes so I'm not faulting the recipe for that!). I enjoyed mine with whipped cream and a sprinkling of nutmeg while hubby loved maple syrup on his. Just a note: to avoid an aftertaste with your waffles and pancakes use an aluminum-free baking powder.",

I put pumpkin in everything burgers meatloaf soups it is very healthy and my picky kid doesn't even notice. My family loved these! I had two remaining and froze them but we ate the next morning.
