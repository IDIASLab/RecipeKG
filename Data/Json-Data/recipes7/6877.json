Avocado and lime-marinated shrimp come to mind. Or grilled and chilled chicken breast. Of course if you do that it stops being a side dish and becomes a main course, but why not? The longer it's chilled the better.",

I grabbed a can of chopped instead of sliced. Same flavor just not as appealing to the eyes. Don't skip the jimaca... it is a real treat in this. I also think all cilantro instead of part parsley would be better. Whichever way you choose, this is excellent!",
