However, the jam was still acceptable. A little soft, but that's the way we like our jam. I also should have chopped the apples smaller, so I used a stick blender briefly while it was cooking.",

I didn't have enough granny smiths so I used a combination of granny smith rome and golden delicious (all great baking apples that retain their shape). I used the called for amount of pectin and increased the butter flavor (however it tasted just fine without it - so don't let this stop you from trying the recipe). I also added some salt to cut down on the sweetness and because I like salted caramel. Very very yummy.. It made 8 half pints.",
