But it really was delectable, sweet, sour, slightly spicy, with a nice little crunch.  I was looking for a recipe to use one of those rogue cucumbers from the garden that grew about 20 inches long.  This filled the bill nicely.  Can't wait to slap some on a burger, hot dog, or grilled chicken breast.  I think it would go very nicely with ribs or roasted anything too.  I put some on a leftover baked potato and it really was nice.  Thank you for the recipe!",
