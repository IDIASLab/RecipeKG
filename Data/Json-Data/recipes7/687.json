The second time it turned out much creamier. Word of advice - get the lemon rind as finely ground as possible and try to make sure it doesn't clump together in the panna cotta. I liked the sauce made with Grand Marnier. I had to subsitute raspberries for strawberries and the sauce still turned out delicious though a bit sweeter than with raspberry. I would not recommend trying to make this days in advance of when you'll be serving it - it gets tried out and icky - it's much better if you make it only the day before or the morning before your event.",
