The recipe does not state to crush the fennel seeds - I don't like whole fennel seed so I crushed mine and then watched the video to see Chef John crushing the fennel.  As for the cooking method, it left the ribs a little drier than we like.  Next time I would season them and double wrap in foil and cook low and slow as directed - then glaze and finish in the oven or on the grill.  Overall, very good flavor, a little on the spicy side.  Watch the amount of chili paste if you don't want them too spicy.",

I used Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce which is HOT but the heat balanced out nicely with the sweetness of the sugar and orange juice. Everyone loved these and they didn't last long!",

I was only making one rack of ribs but I made enough glaze for 2 racks and I am glad I did. I never would have had enough if I had cut that in half. The rub being cut in half for the 1 rack was fine. This is a keeper. Can't wait to try it on friends to see the expression on their faces when they taste it. Thank you submitter.",
