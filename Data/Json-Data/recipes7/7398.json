First, I live at high altitude, so I added 1 heaping tablespoon of flour. Also I substituted 3/4C  whole wheat flour for white flour.  After mixing all the ingredients, the batter was very thick, so I added 1/2 cup of apple cider, since I had some.  The thick batter really had to be addressed, so that's why 3 stars.  I made muffins, which took 26 minutes to bake.   The spice taste is stronger than the pumpkin.  A good muffin.  I don't know if I will make these again or not, but it was fun to try something new.",

I made 3 different pumpkin breads in the same day and did a taste test with a few different people without telling them anything about any of the breads.

I felt there was far more sugar than we would enjoy so I cut back to 3/4 cup each white and brown and it is plenty but something seems to be missing maybe ginger. I made 12 muffins and 1 8\" loaf. The muffins tested done at 20 minutes but could have baked for another 5 or so. The loaf tested done at 35 minutes and started smelling burnt at 40 so I removed it from the oven cooled it and wrapped for freezing so we'll see. I thought eliminating the oil would make this lighter than my usual recipe but this seems much denser. Thanks for something new to try.",
