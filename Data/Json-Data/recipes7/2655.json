                "reviewBody": "I believe between the three of us, Aunt Norma, charliebabe (the submitter) and me, these muffins made rhubarb lovers out of a number of Floridians who had never tasted the stuff before! I deliberately brought some of my garden rhubarb in Wisconsin down to our place in Naples, FL as I wanted to treat the folks here. I am so pleased that these muffins showcased this \u201cpie plant\u201d so well!  I had no fresh buttermilk on hand, but buttermilk powder proved to be a worthy substitute. Because of the brown sugar, they are a rich, caramel color. And because I mixed the batter only till combined, leaving behind some lumps, they were light, tender and fluffy.  The amount of rhubarb was just right \u2013 sometimes I find rhubarb baked goods (apple too, for that matter) that are too heavy with the fruit, with very little \u201ccake.\u201d  It probably is just a subjective thing, but my preference would be to make these without the walnuts \u2013 I found the flavor of them a little distracting. As for the topping, it is buttery, cinnamon sweetness, but it\u2019s a good thing I got 18 muffins with my muffin tins rather than 24, as I don\u2019t think there would have been enough topping for another six!  Just excellent, with old-fashioned homemade appeal and I believe these would be just as good using other fruits if rhubarb is not available.",

I can tell you 2 bowls are NOT necessary.  Add all your dry ingredients into a large bowl to start.  Stir to ensure baking powder and soda are completely mixed into the flour.  Then drop in wet ingredients on top.  Stir JUST UNTIL MOIST!  Using a fork, continue to fold in dry ingredients into the wet in the centre of the bowl.  When you don't see any more dry ingredients STOP!  Batter will be thick.  If your muffins are always tough, you are stiring them too long and with too much \"stir\".  Be gentle.  Don't stir the air out of them.\n\n(if you don't have butter milk, just add 1 tbsp of white vinegar or lemon juice into your milk and let sit while you add all the other ingredients). \n\nthank you so much for sharing!",
