Regardless my daughter and I enjoyed the flavor. Be sure the brewed green tea is completely chilled so you don't melt the other ingredients and we didn't use all of the sugar listed. This is a nice change from heavier milkshakes! Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I have seen numerous green tea flavored recipes calling for matcha which is nearly impossible to find. It would probably be quite expensive just for that reason. I was glad to find a green tea recipe that use brewed green tea so I could try it. I followed the recipe exactly and just brewed a tea bag in some warm tap water for about 5 minutes. It did taste like green tea. I used 1/2 fat ice cream but probably could have just used a couple packs of Truvia in place of the sugar. The only thing I would change is too start with one small drop of green food coloring and blend it. I did the 2 suggested and it looked like a shamrock shake.",

Thank you chripuri91; I'll be making this in my rotation of morning drinks. Especially once it is summer. I used vanilla frozen yogurt since that is what I had let a green tea bag steep for a long time so it was strong 1 drop of food coloring and the ice cubes. The only thing I changed is the sugar. I tasted after 1 TBL and it was plenty sweet. Thank you thank you!",
