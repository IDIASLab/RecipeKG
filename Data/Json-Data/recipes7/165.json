Very easy dough to work with and like I said, my dogs really enjoyed them! Thank you :)",

I used 4 beef and 4 chicken bouillon cubes in 2 cups of boiling water instead of milk. I used parsley (about 1/4 cup) instead of paprika (I read a review where someone said parsley helps with dog's breath). I didn't use any poultry seasonings, butter, or milk. Again I don't think it's needed in a dog treat. Next time I think I will put more eggs and add garlic. But with the changes I made the first time, my dogs loved them! And they actually picked them over store bought!! That's a success in my book!",
