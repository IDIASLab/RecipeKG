These are delicious even without frosting--as you see them in my photo. They kept their shape pretty well and were very easy to handle. I rolled them between two sheets of parchment and had no problem at all with them being too sticky. Start with half the amount of sugar and add as necessary. I got 20 cookies from half a recipe and the cooking time of 10 minutes was perfect. They are flaky and light and have a very subtle taste! My granddaughters will definitely want them frosted and that will leave you with many options! Thanks for the recipe Cindy.",
