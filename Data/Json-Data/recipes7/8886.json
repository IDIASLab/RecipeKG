I used one for half of this recipe, and there were parts that had the consistency of an omelet. I would say you can probably get away with one egg for the entire recipe. I didn't have vanilla (apparently I have been baking up a storm), but this dish was good without it.",

I took the other reviewer's advice and only used 1 egg and that worked out really well (thanks). I also used coconut oil and 1/2 butter and a little less sugar. I'd say 1/4 cup would work just fine. I didn't have vanilla either but it still tasted great. I'll definitely make this again soon.",
