I ended up making these for Easter weekend to give out as gifts. So far the cookies haven't made it past the 2 hour mark after being opened and left up on a table for consumption. Hope you love these as much as my friends and family do! Enjoy!",

Instead of dipping the bottom of each bar into chocolate I decided to pour the chocolate chips onto the shortbread crust as soon as it came out of the oven. I covered it with a sheet tray for a minute allowing the chips to melt. Then I spread the melted chocolate chips with an offset spatula and put the pan into the fridge to set the chocolate. When I was ready with the caramel/coconut mixture I spread that on the bottom crust of the shortbread after inverting the pan. The whole process was much easier than making cookies and the yummy outcome was the same.",

I say thankfully because I was so tired of putting them together I just gave up and left over 1 dozen of them plain. These are a lot of work and have many steps. If I do ever attempt them again I will try store bought dough and at least cut one step out. I do as much as I can from scratch because we have food allergies in my home. I rated them 4 stars because the flavor is very good. The one thing I would definitely suggest is to have extra melted caramel on hand and spread it on the cookie before you attempt to stick the topping. You need it to act as the glue or else the topping will just fall off. Super frustrating after all of that work. They are so filling you can only eat 2 anyway so 24 was plenty for us.",
