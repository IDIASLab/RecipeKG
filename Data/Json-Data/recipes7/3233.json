(i had NO IDEA what i was thinking) this made it more soup like however it was perfect. i did not add the parsley as i did not have any. if you do not like spicy i would recommend a pinch of the red pepper flakes. with the 1 tsp it is a bit spicy but not overbearing. i love it. i also added 1 cup of chopped carrots. i had them on hand so why not. i assume this would have been a stew had i not added 2 1/2 times as much liquid as called for but suprisingly it seemed correct and it worked out. lucky for me i had all the spices. i cannot imagine this tasting the same without them so i would strongly recommend that you indeed have these spices on hand.",

I tailored it to my taste- substituted fresh cilantro in place of the Thyme and parsley because I had it on hand and prefer the taste (and because I love cumin and cilantro together!) and subbed chicken stock for the vegetable stock.(I'm obviously not a vegetarian...) I subbed a little allspice for the coriander because I didn't have the coriander. I also added cubes of potato to the boiling water with lentils and boiled until tender to add to the dish and I added shredded carrot to the sautee of vegetables. Lastly I added a can of black beans. I think it turned out like an amazing vegetarian chili! Mmmm... I had a ton leftover so I added shredded chicken to it and it was delicious! A new favorite for me:-)",
