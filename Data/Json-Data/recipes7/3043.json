However, the topping didn't have enough liquid in it, so I added more sour cream and a bit of water; otherwise it didn't even have enough liquid to mix the flour properly.  Next time, I would probably add some brown sugar crunch topping of some sort to add a bit of interest.  It was very easy to make, though, and everyone scoffed it up with whipped cream on top.",

I had to add some milk to the batter not only to mix it but even more to make it \"spreadable\" as the recipe directed. The finished topping part was how shall I call it almost rubbery. Also the ratio of topping to fruit was off - too much topping not enough fruit. Hate to rate it like this but it just wasn't to our liking.",

The first modification is that I used vanilla bean Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and I also didn't have enough white sugar so I used brown sugar in the cake part. I also added about 1/3 cup of water to the batter because it was too dry. I also used two bags of frozen rhubarb rather than fresh. It turned out very well and even the kids who were skeptical at first ended up loving it. Thanks for sharing the recipe! We'll definitely make it again.",
