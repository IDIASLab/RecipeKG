        "description": "Made from the famous Pueblo, Colorado chiles grown on farms in the fertile and sun-kissed Saint Charles Mesa, this pork chili can be made from medium-hot to con fuego! These chiles are comparable to mild jalapenos or can be much hotter than cayenne peppers. Choose your peppers carefully for the heat you can handle! Our family's favorite ways to eat this include: with warmed tortillas, over rice, topped with tomatoes, sour cream and avocado, or smothered tamales (steam any type of tamales separately, unwrap, and pour chili on top).",
