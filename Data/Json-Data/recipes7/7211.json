For the shortbread crust I mixed 1/2 cup of softened butter with 1 Cup flour and 1/4 powdered sugar until it was crumbly then patted it into a tart pan.  Bake for about 25 minutes at 350.  The cream cheese layer needed a little sweetening - I would add a couple of tablespoons of powdered sugar to it.  As for the glaze, I didn't want it chunky so a used a hand held blender to puree the strawberries in the pan - it was still to chunky so I ran the sauce through a fine mesh sieve and the glaze was perfect and glossy.  I will make this again - it is beautiful.",

This is different from the packaged strawberry glazes that you can buy.  A little more rustic I guess.  After the glaze is cooked, it will look like strawberry jam.  Hope everyone enjoys this pie because I sure do!",

I live in Canada I couldn't find a premade shortbread crust I used the Joy of Baking's recipe for it. I don't have a tart pan I used my 9 inch springform instead. My son doesn't eat cream cheese I used President's Choice Dark Chocolate sauce instead. I had to add about 3/4 cup of water to the strawberry sauce it was way too thick I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup which was good for us I used my immersion blender to puree. Next time I will use 1 tbsp cornstarch and sieve the sauce as Baking Nana did for a nicer presentation. It was enjoyed by all but I didn't like the cloudiness of the sauce.",

One thing we love about this pie is the chunky glaze- (make sure to boil it until it turns from cloudy to clear and add water if it s too thick) and the plain unsweetened cream cheese base which keeps this a mildly sweet dessert! Another variation that s even better than the strawberry version is made exactly the same way but with blueberries. (Pur\u00e9e the sauce with an immersion blender). And I just make a regular tender flake pie crust.",
