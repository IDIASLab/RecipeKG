One thing you can do is instead of using lime juice you can use 2-3 tablespoons white vinegar to create milk solids and that way you wont have to worry about rinsing the milk solids. And also you don't really have to make the simple syrup in a pressure cooker. You can actually make it in a large pot. But either way it will be an awesome authentic Rusgullahs.",
