I didn't have enough poppy seeds, so used about half the amount, and then I increased the lemon flavor by subbing about 1/4 cup of the milk with lemon juice in the frosting and doubling the lemon zest in the cake. It was super good! Much more lemon flavor. I like the cake both ways, but if you're a lemon fan you might want to try it that way!",
