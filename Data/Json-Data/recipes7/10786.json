I normally don't use gravy or seasoning packets (personal preference) but decided to try this because of the ease and convenience. I made it exactly as written (well, I added in an extra celery stalk and used 1/2 onion instead of 1/4 -whatever) and this came out perfectly tender at 6 hrs. I imagine if you're working a longer day you could put in on low for 8-10hrs and it would be equally tasty.  I was so mad today when I left for work and forgot my leftovers at home! Thanks for sharing your recipe Megan!",

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers saying how could you rate a given recipe if you modify it to the point of something that does not come close to what the person wrote. As given this is a great and very easy recipe. The end result is excellent and the best part is that you don't have to be a culinary chef to have an easy meal that you can be proud of serving to family or guests. A crusty bread would be all that you need to complete this as written. On my second time I modified the recipe just a bit. Because the gravy was a bit thin for my liking I made a roux from 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup flour and 2 cups of the stew liquid added that mixture to thicken it along with 1/2 small bag each of frozen corn and peas about an hour before finish. Thank you for your excellent recipe that I can use as is and as a base for some modifications!!",
