I did use a bain marie to make the custard. I think I will just use a saucepan next time. I used almond meal instead of chopped almonds. It gave the cake a smoother texture. I sifted the meal once and as well the confectioners' sugar. I also lowered the temp of my oven to 375 degrees F; 400 degrees F in my opinion is too hot.",
