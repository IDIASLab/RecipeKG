I used all white sugar instead of brown and white I used half clove and half all spice I doubled the rhubarb (4 cups) and I used half all purpose flour and half whole grain. Also instead of nuts or other fruit (which I didn't have) I used coconut. They turned out great but they are definatly more muffin consistancy than cookie but thats ok because they are tangy sweet moist and semi-healthy. I'll probably eat the whole batch tonight! lol",
