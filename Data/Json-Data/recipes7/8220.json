We sliced peeled and cored the 5 1/2 lbs. of Golden Delicious apples (which completely filled my 6-quart crock pot)and then mixed the honey sugars and spices exactly as listed in the recipe and put them on top. Cooked on high 1 hour as directed then cooked on low for 10 hours. When it was done I used a wire whisk for a couple of minutes to achieve a smooth consistency. It tastes amazing and was a hit with everyone in our family adults and kids alike! Notes: We live at almost 6 000 ft. elevation so it may take less time at lower elevations. Also I took the lid off the crock pot as it cooled to prevent condensation from watering down the apple butter. We will definitely be making this again and again.",

After peeling and coring the apples I put the apples in my Vitamix and did a course chop so the apples would fit in my 6 quart crock pot. I had about 2 inches left to spare in the pot. I used about 3 teaspoons of apple pie seasoning since it had cinnamon nutmeg and allspice. Used the same amount of sugars and honey. My son and I could of eaten all of it before it was cooked. Followed the cooking instructions and let it cooked overnight. Boy did the house smell wonderful! Used a stick blender to make it a smooth texture. I took the lid off after 10 hours and it thickened just a little bit. It was more like an applesauce consistency and is really sweet. May lessen the sugar next time. I ended up filling 11 1/2 pint size jars. Plan to give them out as gifts. Thanks!",

My husband and son spooned the warm chunky apple mixture right out of the crock pot and put it over vanilla ice cream. They raved about it and insisted I leave it exactly the way it was - no mashing. It was a little sweet and the honey gave it a distinct honey taste. If you don't like the taste of honey I would decrease or eliminate it. Great recipe. Will definitely use again.",
