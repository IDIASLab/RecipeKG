I halved the baking powder right away doubled the banana and added a touch of vanilla extract and a couple sprinkles of ground allspice. I also used regular all-purpose flour. They turned out super fluffy the amount of banana was perfect for me and the texture is very nice. Definitely one of my new favorite recipes!",
