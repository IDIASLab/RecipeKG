It's terrific! I didn't have swiss cheese, but I did have shredded Italian Blend cheese, so I used it instead. And because I had 2 shallow pie crusts, I added an extra egg and dollup of sour cream to the mix so I could fill both pie pans. Well, it was absolutely delish! Even my husband, who doesn't like quiche much, loved it! Definitely a keeper... the recipe AND the husband! LOL",

I followed the recipe and instructions exactly with one addition of a half cup of cheddar (for my hubby) - it came out fluffy, perfectly browned on top with the crust cooked through.  (It filled my deep dish pie plate right to the top.). The texture was incredible - the pieces held their shape but each bite tasted like soft scrambled eggs melting in your mouth. I found it a nice balance of onion, bacon and chess flavours.  The egg, milk, sour cream ratio makes a really great deep dish quiche. Thank you again for your work on making a great recipe!!",
