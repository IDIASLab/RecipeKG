To get a crispy biscotti I had to bake them 7-8 minutes on both sides. Depending on how crisp you like your biscotti the second baking time will need to be longer. The dough was so easy to roll out. Some biscotti recipes have sticky dough. This dough was not sticky. I loved the orange zest along with the orange extract and cranberries. I cut off the ends and of course I had to taste the biscotti. Delicious!",

I have a two year old oven and have a thermometer in the oven (although I'm not a baker or chef, but my wife is...). Lol!\n\nI made two batches one following the recipe to the letter and I had to bake that batch about 8 extra minutes and then after slicing and placing them back in the oven to finish them, that also took about 8 minutes longer...\n\nThe second batch I bumped the temp up to 375 and that one was perfect at the recipe times.\n\nAll in all, a great recipe!",

Information on length of logs would be helpful after dividing the dough the cook is left to guess on how long/thick to make the logs. My oven is accurate but after baking the maximum recommended time they were still very underdone. Added 10 minutes and they were beginning to brown but still underdone in the middle. Added 10 MORE minutes and let cool then sliced - still somewhat dense and doughy in centers. the slices were normal biscotti sized so the logs weren't unduly thick when first baked. the second bake took a long time because the slices had to be turned and re-baked several times. When they were finally crisp enough and cooled a bit I was very disappointed at the blandness of the taste - the orange flavor was barely there even with the extracts AND the zest. Boring and ho-hum. I suppose with a ton of tinkering this recipe might be okay but why bother with a total makeover? I'll glaze these with a strong orange glaze so they're edible but I won't make these again.",
