I think I figured out the correct amount see below In the ingredients list it says 1/2 ounce Cross & Blackwell Mint sauce Divided. It should be 1/2 cup divided on step two it says \"remaining 1/4 cup olive oil\" this should be 4 tablespoons of olive oil and then in step 3 you use the remaining 2 tablespoons in the skillet. other than that this is a great recipes thanks for sharing",
