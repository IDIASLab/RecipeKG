For our taste preference, I'll probably cut back a little on the sugar the next time, just a bit sweet for us.  I always have tomato paste on hand, so I doubt that I'll buy V-8 again, as this was a pretty good substitute.  We like spicy tomato juice, so today I added some Tabasco and a sprinkle of celery salt, and we had something equivalent to Spicy V-8 Juice Cocktail (just add vodka for a Bloody Mary).  It's tasty, super easy to make, and cost-effective.  For us, this one's a keeper.",
