The sauce and onions tasted amazing with the rice I served it on it really reminded me of a chinese dish of some sort. I am very picky about any gamey taste and you really truely could not tell this was venison and I wasn't even using the backstrap. We will make this many more times. I don't like store bought dressings so I used my fav. balsamic vinaigrette: In a jar w/ lid mix 1/2 c. balsamic vinegar (I like cosco brand) 2 tsp. sugar 1 tsp minced garlic 1 tsp. dijon mustard. shake vigorously..add 1/2 c. E. V. Olive oil..shake like crazy. then I added 1/2 c. raspberry jelly for this recipe. I did not \"boil\" my meat like the recipe implies but instead seared it in an extremely hot pan which carmelized it nicely. I also added 1 tbsp. chicken bullion to the onion water. yummy!",
