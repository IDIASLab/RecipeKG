I added used brown sugar instead of regular sugar, and added about 1 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce, which I heated over low heat until the peanut butter melted. Instead of broccoli, I added shredded cabbage, shredded carrots and green onion. I also used extra chunky peanut butter, which added a nice crunch. I used pork instead of shrimp, as I already had some ready for use. Thanks so much for the post! I'll be making ths one often.",

I did substitute whole wheat fettucini for the whole grain aspect. The sauce is very good. The only addition I made was one teaspoon of chile garlic sauce to add some spice. I have tried many peanut sauce recipes, because I love it. This was by far the easiest and quite good. This dish was fast, easy and healthy. Definitly a keeper!",

I took a few liberties not the least of which was using thin spaghetti (we've got a ton of that and no Japanese udon noodles in sight) using 1/2 balsamic vinegar and half cider vinegar to sub for the Chinese black vinegar and doubling the sauce. I had already cooked shrimped so I chose to cook the spaghetti and broccoli together then add to a wok that had oil peanuts and garlic in it. Then I added the sauce and shrimp until everything was warmed through. I added garlic and onion powder plus a sprinkle of dried red pepper to the sauce. Very nice little recipe and easy. I'd be willing to buy the Chinese black vinegar and udon noodles to try this and make it (a little!) more authentic. Thanks for the recipe!",
