The recipe doesn\u2019t indicate this, but since you\u2019re directed to bake the corn for an hour, and since corn is generally soaked in its husks, I assumed the husks were meant to be left on.  Two ears fit perfectly in a 2-quart beverage pitcher.  This corn was, in a word, simply excellent - sweet, juicy, delightfully \u201cseasoned\u201d because of the salt/sugar brine.  Time and temperature were both spot on.  Hubs and I couldn\u2019t stop commenting all through dinner on how good this was!",

                "reviewBody": "I had to try this recipe because of the cooking method! Since I had the oven on already anyway and since I had one cob of corn I figured I'd give it a whirl. I halved the ingredients and left it to brine for about two hours before placing it in the oven. I am sorry not to have taken a photo of the cob before cutting it away! It was a little dried-out looking like corn gets when you leave it on the counter too long after taking it from boiling water. The taste was good and didn't need to have any extra seasoning. I probably won't make it again this way but I'm anxious to have someone else make it and see if it was just something I did wrong. I really wanted to like this! EDIT: Talking to the author of this recipe on the Buzz I discovered that the directions to his recipe were supposed to inform us to LEAVE THE HUSKS ON! I'm so glad to see that Naples did that and so now I really need to try this again so I can change my rating! EDIT AGAIN! I felt the need to try this method again! And I did another photo too! We did like this method and the corn was good and it was sweet---not quite like back in the old days when my dad raised his own corn and you could taste the natural sugar crystals in the corn. This does in a pinch. I still like when I put my corn in boiling water for just a very few minutes--just enough to warm it up. That's how I like mine! Thanks Ed. I am done with corn for this season now!",

Yes, brine and bake with the husks; don't bother to clean the silk because once cooked the silk comes off easier than when raw.  One thing that hasn't been mentioned is how your kitchen has this wondrous corn smell while baking.  The end result was awesome using corn from my local farmer's market.  You do want to consider having the oven on for an hour; what does that do regarding costs in fuel and heating your kitchen. If grilling is not available I like this result better than boiling, but having a choice I would still plop soaked cobs in the husks on a grill over this method.  Regardless, this method results in delicious corn.",
