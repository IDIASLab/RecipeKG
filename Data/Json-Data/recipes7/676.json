I recommend pressing the entire tofu block for at least 20 minutes before to remove excess water in the tofu (I place the tofu on a plate and put some weight on top -- like another plate with a bag of beans on top -- and then pour off the liquid once it builds up). I think the pressed tofu is able to capture the marinade better and just tastes nicer. Great recipe!",

I agree but went one step further.  Since the tofu is not to be cooked and there's a raw, beany taste to uncooked tofu, I microwaved the tofu on LOW for a few minutes until it was very hot throughout before pressing and draining.  I also subbed garlic powder for the crushed garlic b/c I'm not crazy about a strong raw garlic taste, and I put the shredded cabbage aside to be used as a bed under the marinated ingredients.  Really enjoyed the resulting almost no-cook summer dish.",

Absolutely amazed that this turned out so well as I usually shy away from using tofu...impressed at how easy and quick it was to prepare; for something so quick the outcome was incredible- stunning colours /a fresh and fruity taste(with a kick due to my peanuts!!).  I could not get sweet chili sauce so used a chinese plum sauce.  I substituted green beans for snowpeas and also added 3 colours of peppers (capsicums) for their sweet taste, great colours and crunchy texture.  Finally, instead of regular peanuts I used a \"mexican botana\" flavoured variety, which added an amazing kick of lime and chile (I suggest adding lime if you are using regular peanuts).  The best accolade was that my husband couldnt get enough of it and insists I make it again!",

As written, I find it heavy on tofu, and a bit short on marinade and snow-peas. I'd recommend doubling the snow-peas, and (for me) halving the tofu. If you keep the tofu quantity as written, I'd recommend doing perhaps an extra 50% marinade - depends a bit on how finely you cube the tofu, and whether you'd like a little extra marinade to get anywhere near the veggies, or not.  Anyway, in principle, it's great!  I shall keep experimenting!",

Important to note is that I pressed the tofu between a towel to get excess water off (for about 30 minutes).... it helps the tofu absorb more flavor. Also important is that I doubled the sauce because otherwise there simply is NOT enough sauce for the salad. I didn't have peanuts I used chopped cashews. Next time I might try to reduce the amount of sesame oil a little for health reasons. Overall a yummy recipe that deserves 5 stars for taste.",
