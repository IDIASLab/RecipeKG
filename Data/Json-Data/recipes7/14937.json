I will be incorporating this step into other apple recipes like apple blondies.\n\nAs for the rest of the fritter, well, it was an utter disaster.  they were too airy so that I could barely flip them without them falling apart.  So, I added more flour which helped a little but they were still too airy and the flavor was dulled a bit because of it.  \n\nI have to blame that on the baking powder.  For some reason the listed amount was too much.  Does it have to do with altitude?  (I'm in a high altitude area) I don't know, but it never effected any of my other recipes this way.  Regardless, I love apple fritters so, I will try again with less baking powder next time.\n\nMy husband, the guinea pig,  said the flavor was good and we will salvage the crispy bits to eat with vanilla ice cream.  :0)",

Since frying isn't one of my favorite things, I fried the  all the fritters on both sides (but not fully), drained them and then put them in a 350 F oven for about 10 minutes to finish the dough in the center.

I didn't want to change the recipe but I had to make some substitutions out of necessity.  I didn't have baking powder  so I used baking soda and yogurt as a rising agent instead. Because I used the yogurt, I didn't need as much liquid so I only used about 1/2 c. of liquid. I didn't have sparkling apple cider so I used a combination of the juice drained off of the cooked apples and some sparkling spiced pumpkin cider. I also covered them with cinnamon sugar in lieu of the frosting because was out of confectioners sugar. I fried them in peanut oil because that's what I had on hand. (I definitely need to go shopping!) I used more batter than Chef John but still ended up with 17 apple fritters approximately 3-4\" in diameter. They're awesome!",
