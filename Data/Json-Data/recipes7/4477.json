Used 1/4 c 1/4 teaspoon Amaretto to soak the raisins in adding the liquid to the first mix. Reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon so maybe it would rise better. To cut fat I replaced the milk and cream with nonfat 1/2 and 1/2. It needed more than 3 cups of flour to keep it from being too sticky so I added another 1/2 cup. I also stuck tiny marzipan clumps in when folding the dough into the pans for rising. Turned out delicious!",
