Its very hard to find any recipe for a cake that fits into her needs. This cake was just okay in my opinion. The flavor was good but the almond flour made it very grainy which was not very pleasant to eat. It was rather heavy and dense as well. The orange sauce was very tasty but it seperates fairly quickly so you really do have to make and serve it immediately. After much more testing I ended up making a lemon sponge cake roll using rice flour and filled with homemade whipped cream/lemon curd for her that was really nice. This recipe had good flavor just really bad texture that no one I tried it on liked.",

This might be due to the fact that I used homemade almond meal--regular almonds chopped in the food processor. The sauce is good but I think next time I'll just leave out the egg whites and use the sugar/orange/buttery syrup instead. Like someone else said the sauce separates quickly. In addition I followed the recipe exactly and had waaaaaaaay too much sauce. I used about a quarter of the sauce and the cake was soaked. The cake reminded me of a nutty pancake drenched in syrup which was very delicious. I will halve the syrup recipe next time and leave out the egg white.",

Having said that I did make it with a few minor modifications. I didn't have a spring form pan so I just used a regular cake pan and greased it with crisco then dusted with rice flour. I had no problems removing it from the pan. I made my own almond meal which may have made the cake a little moister. For the sauce I cut the recipe in half and it was still more than enough. I also made it without the egg whites and put the ingredients in a small saucepan to heat it up. I would absolutely make this again and gave it 4 stars only because of the amount of work it took to make it. The cake alone is delicious and if someone has a sweet tooth they can add the sauce on top.",
