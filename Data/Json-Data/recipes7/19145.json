The recipe calls for already-cooked short-grain rice (likely from a rice cooker) and is a great way to use leftover rice. Make it for breakfast, as a snack, or serve it for dessert! Add additional milk or cream to each bowl when serving, if you like.",

The way the recipe is written the texture leaves much to be desired. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg to each serving along with the cinnamon and it was great.",

I LOVE cinnamon in my rice pudding so I added about 1/2 teaspoon when I added the milk sugar and salt. I was not disappointed. Since my sons and I prefer our rice pudding to be very creamy I added an additional 1/2 c. of whole milk and and additional 1/2 c. of heavy whipping cream. Wow is that decadent! I think that the recipe as written has great flavor I just like mine creamier. Thank you so much for taking the time to submit this recipe!!!",

It's ok but I added more vanilla, more sugar, raisins, more cinnamon, and extra cream so basically I doubled the ingredients for just 2 cups of cooked rice.  I did not like the yellow colour the yolks gave to it. Sorry I am used to a creamy cinnamon flavoured rice pudding that can be eaten  warm or cold.",
