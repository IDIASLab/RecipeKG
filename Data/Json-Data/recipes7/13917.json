The recipe I followed was 3Tb cream cheese, 3 eggs, 1/4 tp distilled white vinegar (instead of cream of tartar) and Splenda. I mixed, I whipped, I folded, I scooped and I baked!!!! 300 for 30 mins. Came out PERFECT!!!! Reviews had suggested that I store it in a bag overnight but I was so excited to make and try it we are about half of them!!!! Now is the fun part to make again and find variations. I want to try garlic bread, make breadsticks or something. It should be fun!!!",

Replace the sugar with truvia and bake it for about half as long as called for (15 min).  Don't worry if the cream cheese doesn't completely incorporate,  it will be fine once baked. Don't make this if you think it is going to taste like conventional bread, it just replaces if you need something to \"hold\" sloppy Joe or make a pp&j and can't have bread. Works great. Will mold if not used with a  few days or so.  Keep in the refrigerator.  You can place in toaster if you want it to crisp up.",

Left cream cheese out of fridge all day and it still wouldn't incorporate completely with eggs. That's after beating it with the mixer for 15 minutes. Hardly worth the work. Had to cut bake time by 10 minutes because tops were becoming DARK. (All other times and temperatures in recipes work just fine). If not eaten right after baking they become a soggy mess. As far as taste slight eggy taste but nothing great. I don't know why I keep trying these recipes - I have never found one worth repeating.",

I've been seeing this floating around the internet a lot, so I was glad to finally try it. It is definitely easy to make and the flavor is great, as well as being super light and fluffy. Do keep check on this, as it didn't quite take as long to brown as the directions say, but that could be a difference in my oven. All in all, I really liked this and I would def make this again~YUM!

I make mine with Splenda instead of sugar, as my daughter & husband are diabetics. Roll up some fruit slices in it & you have a nice desert or snack, any time. Very versatile & easy to make.
