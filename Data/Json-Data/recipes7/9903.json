I don't have measuring utensils; so I eyeballed the ingredients and ended up with something pretty runny (at least for something that was supposed to be cut). Since I don't have a biscuit cutter or even a round cookie cutter I didn't worry too much about the consistency and just plopped it in mounds on a cookie tray. I regularly bake bread and everyone who has tried these thinks I should switch to biscuits. (Not going to happen but they are now the title-holding champion of \"most delicious 'bread' to exit my oven.\") I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't that impressed personally.",
