It had too much molasses and turned out very brown.  It also burned in my oven after being in there for only 8 minutes.  Lastly, my husband and I had sick tummies after eating some of it.  If you can stomach a lot of molasses and are a dedicated vegan, go ahead and try it!  The ingredients are particularly nutritious for expecting mothers (much folic acid and iron).",

Perhaps a little more spice and just a little more sweetener would be good. Word to the wise: better to take out of the oven sooner than later. I kept thinking it didn't quite look toasted enough after stirring it two or three times... so I left it in... and got some burnt pieces on the edge.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe gets 4 stars for not using oil to make granola. This recipe is also good as a basic granola that you can add whatever you want to after it is baked. I baked it first as written and then baked it again with modifications. \n\nI agree with other reviewers that felt that cooking this granola at 350 degrees F is too long and too hot.  It was also not sweet enough for our tastes.\n\nFirst I made this with the suggested ingredients and baked for the 30 minutes at 350 degrees F, stirring and checking it at 10 minute intervals.  I used parchment paper in my two pans.  It browned up nicely.  Unfortunately, it was burnt tasting.  \n\nNext the modifications: I made my second (and third!) batch with more liquid ingredients; I mixed up 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup apple juice and 1 tsp vanilla.  This time I cooked it, as other reviewers have suggested, at 325 degrees F for 20 minutes mixing it up and switching my pans after 10 minutes.  I pulled it out before it got brown or hard/dried out.  There was even some moisture remaining when I stirred it up after I removed it from the oven.  It dried as it cooled.  This combination made the perfect crunchy, sweet-tasting granola. \n\nI will use this recipe again as modified.",
