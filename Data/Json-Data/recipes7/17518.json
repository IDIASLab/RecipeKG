You barely notice the pork; however, you get that incomparable taste of the yolks, wrapped with notes of Porto wine. It is velvety and melts in your mouth, vanishing. It's divine! This is a typical pudding from Braga, Portugal, and it was one of the finalists at the 7 Wonders of Portuguese Gastronomy.",

We are so sorry for the problems this caused! I had this flan (pudim) in Portugal last year from Do\u00e7aria Cruz de Pedra and was blown away! It was AMAZING! As I spoke to one of the bakers there about the recipe I knew it contained port wine and bacon though he told us it was important that it was NOT smoked but rather just cured. But I was anxious to try this recipe as is and made it last night. I typically use recipes as more of a general guide but as I was hoping this would be the recipe of the flan I had in Portugal I followed it to the letter... or thought I did. Unfortunately something went wrong somewhere as it wasn't even thinking about setting up after an hour at 250 F... or two hours at 250.. or another hour at 350. I have a pot of awful looking egg soup that smells like bacon. I hate to give it one star but it is truly inedible. I will try again because it will so be worth it if it's anywhere close to being as good as the one I had in Portugal!",
