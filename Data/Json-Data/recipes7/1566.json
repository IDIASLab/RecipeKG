My apricots were fully ripe and to reduce the liquid (trying to preventing complained-about sogginess) I oven roasted them in a buttered 13x9 pan for 20 min at 425\u00ba. YUM. I used the full amount of sugar in the egg whites and my cake has a definite chiffon cake texture although a little gummy. When making a chiffon cake the leavening action comes from fully developed stiff-beaten egg whites and you cannot reduce the sugar in this step or they can't do their thing properly. I will try this again with the full sweeteners to see if I can get the cake itself to be successful. I suspect most of our commercially grown apricots are much larger and sweeter than the recipe was originally written for.",
