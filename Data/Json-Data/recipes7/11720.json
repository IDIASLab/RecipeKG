I will be making this again - might try cherries next time. Thank you for the recipe!!",

I had biscuick and should've used that instead and it has baking powder in it.  I used canned peaches so I didn't add a lot of sugar to the peachy but did add some and about a tablespoon of butter. Peaches had a good flavor. It's my fault for the cobbler not coming out great because I didn't have white flour and cooked it 5 min to long. Will definitely try again with correct ingredients.",

I needed to make this dairy free so instead of butter I used 1/2 butter flavored Earth Balance spread and 1/2 coconut oil (only because I didn't have enough Earth Balance). I also used sweetened vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk. I wanted to make a big pan of it because I had peaches I needed to use. I peeled and sliced 6 large peaches and mixed with 1 cup of sugar. I doubled the ingredients needed to make the dough. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it took maybe 5-10 extra minutes to bake. My family LOVED it! My husband even took a little to work and shared with a guy who now wants his wife to make some.

I used brown sugar on the peaches instead of white, but I did use white sugar in the batter. I also put 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon on the peaches. The peaches wound up sitting in the brown sugar mixture for several hours, as I was trying to prep ahead. By the time I was ready to put this together, the peaches had juiced themselves because of the sugar. Therefore, I was nervous to put them on top of the batter as the recipe suggested. So I put the peaches on the bottom and added the melted butter (and 2 teaspoons vanilla) to the batter and put it on top. Baked at 375 for about 50 minutes. It was absolutely amazing, my family and dinner guests raved about it. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was simple and wonderful - I will definitely make this again.",
