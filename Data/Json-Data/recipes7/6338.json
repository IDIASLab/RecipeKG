We always called them Texas Ranger Cookies, although no one from my family has ever lived in TX.  Instead of butter my family recipe calls for 1 cup shortening (either plain or butter flavor).  The corn flakes (2 full cups) need to be coarsely crushed (put in plastic bag & roll a can, bottle or rolling pin over the bag). We typically add a full cup of coconut & 1 cup raisins as well.  The recipe doubles easily when making for the holidays & giving to a lot of friends.  These cookies don't have to be soft if you prefer a crisper cookie; we've done both to satisfy different palates in the family.",

There is NO WAY these could have gotten a bad review - not to be offensive, but they do not taste like baking soda & are not dry at all. I respectfully feel that it's a possibility there was a mismeasurement & some over-cooking going on. Tasty tasty tasty! I will make these again & again. The add in of the chocolate chips was genious & I will definitely try the Craisins add-in next. These little honies are magicians with a good disappearing act around my house! P.S. That's my photo featured on this recipe ;)",
