                "reviewBody": "This is exactly what I was looking for, a rhubarb-strawberry crisp and an oat topping with brown sugar! I appreciate that this uses a little less sugar than most rhubarb recipes too. I let the rhubarb sit like instructed with the sugar, except I used only a pinch of salt than the 1/2 tsp. called for. And I left out the tapioca as I was using flour instead. I like to see how much liquid comes out of the rhubarb before I add a thickener, in this case I used 3 Tablespoons of flour as there was quite a lot of liquid. I used a 7x11\" glass casserole dish, the amount of topping was spot on for this!! A 9-10\" square or round cake pan would work too. Any bigger and you'll want to make more topping. I also used semi-cold butter and worked the topping with my hands instead of melting the butter. This was not too sweet, the rhubarb still retains it's tartness. I used one cup of fresh strawberries which adds just a little natural sweetness. If you want more of a strawberry taste you might want to up it to two cups of slice strawberries, but I like it the way it is! This is a good basic recipe and one can add their own flavourings or spice to suit their taste. I used a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg in the oat topping and a splash of vanilla in the fruit. This is perfect! Thanks for your recipe Karen!",
