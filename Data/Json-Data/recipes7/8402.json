By the time I added everything I found the dough to be so sticky I began adding hand fulls of flour till I was able to roll it into log form without the use of grease. That's just my preference. As for baking time I left it in a bit longer till golden in color, again preference. \n\nThe second time, the same flour amounts but added a pinch of cardamom and used Himalayan rock salt, the nuts I did half almonds and half pecans, the rest the same as first time. \n\nThird time, used all bread flour, same nut combo and same salt.  \n\nI also added a cup of chocolate chips in each batch. I like the consistency of the half and half dough the best but wouldn't go out of my way to buy bread flour for just this.  My favorite is the second one with the cardamom.",

I followed the recipe, except for adding 1 tsp cardamom (as per the other reviewer's fantastic suggestion) and used 1 full tsp of vanilla. My only issue with the mandelbrot was with the bake time. 25 minutes for the first bake was not nearly long enough. I baked them 30 minutes, and they were still not quite done--I should have probably baked them at least 35-40 mins. Then after slicing them (which was a bit difficult due to them not being fully baked), I ended up baking them about 15 minutes per side to get them nice and golden. Baking time adjustment aside these are sooo incredibly delicious, and a 5 star flavor all the way! Thank you for the recipe!",
