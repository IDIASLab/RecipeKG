I bought a pkg of mini gourmet cukes (unwaxed so I didn't have to peel them) which turned out to be the perfect size for my jar.  As far as the amount of the fresh dill to use, I just loaded up the jar with the the dill stems and cuke spears, and poured in the vinegar mixture.  White vinegar is milder in taste, so these pickles won't make you pucker, and as others mentioned, I'm not sure you even need the small amount of sugar.  They are crunchy and simply fresh tasting, and that works for me.   I can see this on the Christmas Gift List this year.",
