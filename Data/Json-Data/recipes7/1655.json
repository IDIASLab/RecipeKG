One of the best uses for Matcha (powdered green tea) that I've ever seen.\n\nI did everything the recipe called for, mixed everything by hand, and added raspberry filling on top after it cooled.\n\nNotes:\n- Probably needed more than an hour to cool. I was in no hurry so I let it cool for about 4 hours after making it, so I don't know for sure. But it didn't look firm enough after just an hour.\n\n- Raspberry and Green Tea combination is delicious! Also prevents any naysayers from turning it down on the green color alone.\n\n- Would probably use a different crust next time. Graham cracker texture was wrong and was generally too sweet for the filling. Maybe shortbread like the other reviewer, but will have to experiment.\n\nIn general, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Wonderfully delectable!",

Otherwise, perfect taste, perfect texture and consistency ... the only thing I'm sad about is how much weight I'll be gaining scarfing out on this cheesecake!",

The fat-free cream cheese gives this a rubbery texture. So if I did this again I would just adapt it to my favorite cheesecake recipe.  I used splenda, and did not like the after-taste of it. I used a shortbread crust. The recipe suggest chilling for one hour but it needs much more time than that to chill up. Green tea varies by color and strength depending on the quality of it.

It's very simple and that's a good thing:) I agree with using a shortbread crust (the one on this site is really good!). The taste of the filling was kind of off and the rubbery top functioned as a... \"membrane?!\" The top \"membrane/skin\" kind of held the inside filling in which was... interesting. I did add some raspberries as suggested to mask the strange rubbery look and taste (as I had almost-powder green tea it was a little bitter and unsmooth). But despite that I was still grossed out. I really thought this recipe had potential. I want to try it again and get it RIGHT but I would have to BUY the powder and not attempt to grind up the leaves (as suggested in another recipe). I would try again if I don't mind risking more ingredients though! Thanks for the recipe even though I might not use fat free cream cheese as written because that might be what caused the rubbery top!",
