I took a star off because the recipe was a little confusing to follow (and unnecessarily complicted in the mixing instructions) and also because it calls for 4 t. cinnamon (divided) but only tells you where to add one of the teaspoons. I added the additional cinnamon to the Pop-Tart crust (2 t.) and to the batter (1 t.). Also, the picture shows a cupcake, but the recipe makes a cake. I actually made mini cupcakes, which will be perfect for our shower, so I am excited to serve these at that time. If you do this, as well, reduce the baking time to about 22 minutes. I took these to a driveway happy hour to test them out on my friends as guinea pigs, and they LOVED them! Overall, a home run and will be a fun surprise for my attorney niece, who still doesn't eat like a grown-up!",
