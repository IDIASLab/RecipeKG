My kids love to help me make them and it isn't too difficult for them to join in on the baking. At first I thought it was a bit tedious, but it was more fun than expected! They are best eaten when just cool enough to handle. Enjoy!",

I agree with the other person in the comments who said they spread too much and had to continuously add more flour. With the amount of flour after the first 8 minutes they were already slighty burnt. 'A few more minutes at golden brown.' Didn't work just want you to know. Great idea but a few small things didn't let it work. If you add half cup of flour and only 3 minutes after putting the marshmallows in they turn out amazing.",

The second sheet still spread too much so I added 1/4 cup more flour. I also chilled the dough. This helped. I think taking them out of the oven to put on the Hershey bar and marshmallows does something to the baking process as my cookies weren t fully done all the way thru. I kept putting less and less on the sheet (to minimize time out of the oven). I only had 5 on the sheet for the last batch that seemed to work well. Knowing what I know now I would probably make this again. First I want to see how the cookies taste the day after; fresh out of the oven the marshmallow really is awesome.",
