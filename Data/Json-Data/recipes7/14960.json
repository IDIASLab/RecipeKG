For the second pie I made I added more melted butter to the topping before stirring it and adding the topping onto the apple mixture in the pie. It seemed to need more butter to crumble the amount of topping in the recipe. I also found the recipe makes more topping than is needed for the pie so I ended up with a lot of left over topping which is why I ended up making 2 pies instead of 1. It tasted great though.",
