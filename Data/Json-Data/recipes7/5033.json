Different variations of it are also being eaten during Christmas and Easter. This is the first ever cake I managed to successfully bake (at the age of 13) and since then I have been baking it for my friends in various spots around the world, including Negev Desert in Israel where I used solar oven (6 hours baking time).",

My Babci recently passed away and this was our first family holiday without her so I decided to give this a shot in her honour. It was a long process but a lot of fun! The only complaints I had: a) the yeast cakes were IMPOSSIBLE to find! and b) The dough rose WAY too much. I had to poke holes through the middle of the cake while it was baking because it was getting so tall the plums were falling off the sides. It ended up tasting amazing though and my family loved it...they said it tasted just like something Babci would've made herself:) Next time I think I'll split the dough into 2 pans though. It was just a little too much for a 9x13.",

I was so excited when I found this one but alas this came out more like a heavy bread than a cake. I think I'll try it again someday using half the flour and double the milk. Also the instructions say to \"knead in as much air as possible \" but as a cooking technique kneading is about pushing air out not incorporating it in. So I'm not sure what the author means by that. I think if this were more of a batter it might be a good recipe.",

As it is in the recipe it would overflow the tray and shed plums to the sides. Also: is it absolutely vital that an amount of milk/water is more precisely specified for the kneading phase. For a non-expert \"as needed\" doesn't make any sense and the level of moisture achieved is critical for a good drozdz\u00f3wka because if too dry it's miserable. Ciao!",
