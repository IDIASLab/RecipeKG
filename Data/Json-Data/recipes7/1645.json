Our recipie is basically the same but doubled - except fot the cream (Grandma mentioned she often halved the reciped though so would be very similar!) Instead of sherry we used 1/2 cup boiling water to dissolve the gelatin and instead of vanilla we use almond extract. We also add 1/2 cup slivered almonds and 1 whole almond (the one who gets it gets the prize - usally a small box of chocolates or a christmas ornament). Instead of raspberries we use a strawberry sauce. One package of frozen sweetened berries thawed cooked with 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and 1/2 c water until thickened. I always tried to get the prize as a kid eating 2 or 3 bowls until I was ready to burst. I still get teased by family every Christmas Eve when the pudding comes out after supper.
