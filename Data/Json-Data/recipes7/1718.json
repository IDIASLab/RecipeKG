I have been using these to perk up my veggie sandwiches and they are great. I love the new twist. The temp is below zero here in Minnesota and there was no way I was going to get out the grill, so I just simmered the onions in the vinegar solution on the stove until they were soft (about 5-10 min).  I cut down the sugar and salt a bit due to personal preference, and added a bit of pickling spice.",

I picked a BLT on Ciabatta with pesto mayonnaise but these were also on the sandwich and they MADE the sandwich! I was so happy to come across this recipe - made them the othe rnight as I was grilling veggies for another recipe and had some for lunch today on my turkey sandwich. Great sweet onion/slightly tart flavor that is a great addition to sandwiches! Thank you CookBrooke for sharing!:)",
