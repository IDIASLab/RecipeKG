It is very easy, a little time-consuming, delicious, and makes a lot of pickles. The recipe says to put them in jars, but I just store them in a clean gallon-sized ice cream bucket. Will keep in the refrigerator for up to a year.",

For our tastes, I reduced that amount to 2 cups sugar, and that amount was PLENTY sweet enough for us.  I\u2019d probably cut it back to 1-3/4 cups sugar next time, but this just could be personal taste preference.  I used unwaxed mini cucumbers and mini red bell peppers, and my mandolin made this a very easy recipe to make. They definitely are sweet, but they definitely are GOOD.",
