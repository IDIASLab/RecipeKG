It tastes better to me when I don't mix the sugar with the oil right away.",

I used 1/2 head green cabbage, 1/4 head red, 1 medium onion, 2 carrots - all shredded in my food processor. For 'sauce' - seasoning packet from noodles (oriental flavor works best, but I only had chicken), 1/4 cup light olive oil, 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, 1/8 cup soy sauce, 1/8 cup water, 2 Tb white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix it all together. I tossed in some 'zingy currants' I had on hand from Nature Box - could use raisins, was looking for sunflower seeds, but all I could find was sesame seeds, so I toasted them and added that with the crunched up noodles to the rest of the salad. If you add a grilled, boneless skinless chicken breast, diced, you've got a one dish summer meal that's great - and leftovers are so yum.",

My only one complaint is that it was a little bit too sweet for me but I tend to be more sensitive to sweet than most. I'll scale the sugar back next time but that is the only change I will make. I found it easiest to mix all of the dressing ingredients together in a separate bowl until well combined and then just before serving I poured it over the cabbage mixture and gave it a few stirs. It makes for a beautiful presentation this way. On the ingredient list the \"dressing\" ingredients start at the sugar and down and then your seasoning packet from the ramen. Adjust the sugar if you feel the need but other than that I promise you will not be disappointed!",
