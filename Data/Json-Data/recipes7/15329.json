The only changes I made were to up the fruit amount to 9 cups (our freezer broke and we had to get rid of stuff) so I also upped the zest amount to 1 Tbs to use the entire orange but kept the juice to 1/4 cup. I loved every bite and it goes so well on vanilla ice cream! I look forward to using it on oatmeal!",
