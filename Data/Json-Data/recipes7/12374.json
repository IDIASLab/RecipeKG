I looked at the recipe and decided that it called for way more sugar than anything I wanted to serve but because I enjoy the combination of pineapple/coconut and pecans decided to make it with 7/8 of a cup of sugar instead of the 2 cups called for. First bite was overwhelming with it's sweetness! Way too much with less than half the sugar called for! Will not make it again",
