I topped them with grass-fed butter and homemade chocolate syrup - cocoa powder maple syrup and vanilla extract to taste. After tinkering with the recipe me and my daughter enjoyed them. I look forward to trying them again with chocolate chips for total chocolate insanity. Note - I did use coconut palm sugar instead of white or brown. I sub it in all of my baked goods as it enhances the flavor.",
