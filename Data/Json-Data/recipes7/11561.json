I had a small portion of cauliflower and broccoli left so I adjusted the other ingredients. Because I knew we would have leftovers I added the croutons to the individual salads before serving. By doing so the salad was still fresh the next day and additional croutons were added. I love how much this taste like 24-hr layered lettuce salad but made and eaten the same day. I will definitely be using this recipe again. We had this salad with 'Buffalo Chicken Calzone' another AR recipe. Thanks for sharing SFORD1024",
