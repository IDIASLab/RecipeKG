I reduced salt to 1 tbsp because I also use a bbq sauce to finish at the end. I also added a bit of cumin just because. I marinate ribs overnight with the rub, applied freely. I fully cook the ribs slowly in the oven (I have a steam/convection combination). At the end, I remove ribs and brush on bbq sauce and put back in oven on high heat for just 10 minutes, or throw on grill. I have been told these are the best ribs someone has ever tasted, including restaurants.\n\nThank you for this recipe. I made it my own, but I started with this.",

I rubbed ribs, refrigerated for 18 hours, slow cooked 225\u00b0 for 6 hours....due to the low temp, the brown sugar didn\u2019t fully crystallize, so they turned out with a little crunch and very sweet bite to start. Finer ground brown sugar would fix that! The recipe is enough for at least two full racks, maybe three, so save the extra in a container.",
