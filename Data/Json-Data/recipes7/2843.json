I discovered when I got home that I had purchased my cereals a size too small.  So maybe that affected how it turned out.   Anyway it is very nice.  I can't eat very much of it because it is very sweet.  I must say this recipe is a lot of fun for kids to help with and it is ready to eat very quickly.  My grandkids like to measure and pour and it is easy because it took whole packages of cereal and whole packages of almonds and whole sticks of butter.  So everyone had a turn putting ingredients in.  Also the grandkids liked bagging this in pretty bags to give to other people for Christmas gifts.",
