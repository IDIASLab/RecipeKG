I halved the recipe as I was using a roast that weighed 3.5 lbs. We used a pork loin roast as opposed to the Boston butt listed in the recipe as that is what we had on hand. In addition to the fennel and onions we sliced up some cabbage we had in the fridge as I thought it would be add a great flavour. Next time I will add potatoes and make more of the rub to mix with the vegetables as they aren't flavourful on their own (water doesn't add flavour). The toasted spices were ground in our coffee grinder and then added to a food processor with the ouzo and garlic. This rub is amazing! Our roast was done after about 2.5 to 3 hours. Making this again for sure!",

My roast was 8 lbs. \nI did not have ouzo, but I did have a pod of star anise, which I broke up into the pot. \nMy mortar and pestle were broken, so I used a VitaMix blender on the spices, and then toasted them. The house had a strong smell of roasted fennel thereafter. The dried thyme wants to burn. \nI added no water, and cut up a couple of carrots which I threw into the pot for the heck of it, along with the two thick-sliced onions. \nIt came out very, very well. The dark flavors of the fennel and the anise go so well with the pork, and the veggies help baste the meat. \nThis is company-good. \nFor what it's worth, I'm not one of those people who normally likes a lot of anise (I can't stand licorice).
