The brioche that I had was very moist so I put it on a cookie sheet and dried it in the oven for about five minutes on each side 170. I probably could ve done this a little longer. We did six slices of Brioche and had about half of the mixture left over so next time will cut that in half. I also did not have nut Meg on hand as we were traveling so I use cinnamon instead. My French toast also did not perfect but it didn t make a difference to us. The brown better with the syrup combination was over-the-top. Thank you so much for posting a wonderful recipe that my family will enjoy for years to come.",

This was the perfect amount of custard for 6 - 1\" slices of Brioche. I sliced the bread & left it out overnight & also made the custard the night before & put it in the fridge so the flavors could meld together - the flavor was outstanding!\nWhat a wonderful recipe! We almost always choose pancakes or Belgium waffles for  our once a month indulgent breakfast, but saw this recipe & decided to give it a try. My husband, who is not a French Toast guy thought this was \"wonderful & spectacular\"! \nThe browned butter was such a great layer of flavor which perfectly complimented the sweetness of the syrup. We will be making this in 2 weeks for visiting family.  As to the bread puffing up, some did, some did not - who cares! All was absolutely delicious!",
