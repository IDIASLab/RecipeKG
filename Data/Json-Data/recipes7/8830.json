It came out of the pan beautifully.  The glaze pools around the cake, so I kept spooning it back on until the whole cake was covered.  Because of this, I'll pour the glaze on a separate pan next time and tansfer it to the serving dish when it has hardened a bit (just to make it a little neater).  I made it for Valentine's Day, so after adding the glaze, I added some pink and white heart-shaped sprinkles while it was still warm, and they set into the glaze.  It looked beautiful!  The glaze soaked into the cake at the bottom and made a crust all around and the taste was just perfect.  I will be making this many times!",

My husband (who doesn't generally like cakes) really enjoyed this, as did all who had a slice at the BBQ we brought it to. Thanks for the recipe!",

I wanted to do half applesauce, half oil but realized I didn't have applesauce. Despite these changes it still worked out well. It was plenty sweet enough especially with the glaze. I didnt have lemon extract but substituted lemon zest, about 2 Tbsp. The texture seemed a little dense , probably due to these changes, but it was still worth serving to company.",

I was surprised I expected the taste to be more overpowering with all the lemon juice and extract in it. I absolutely loved this. The only issue I had and that's probably on me was that the glaze did not stay on top of the cake it soaked into the cake. I reapplied every so often and only used about half of the glaze but I ended up with no glaze on top and a sugary grainy sticky layer on the bottom. I think I didn't bake the cake long enough it was done but still quite pale on top and extremely moist and dense inside. Definitely not crumbly. I will make this again it just tastes too good and that time I will bake it longer and see if that helps.",
