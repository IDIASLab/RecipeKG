This is a slightly sweet and savory version compared to the tomato-based versions out there - it reminds me more of what you would get in a restaurant. I use sugar, cinnamon, and more butter than other offerings in my version. I always make my version of Coconut Chicken Curry when I make this recipe. This dish pairs well with a rice side; I prefer basmati rice, particularly as a pilaf. It also pairs well with naan bread.",
