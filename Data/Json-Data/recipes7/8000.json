The end result was it was just kind of watered down tasting. I think pumpkin latte made with espresso and steamed milk and then topped with whipped cream is just so much better. Also unless your microwave is super powerful or you use blazing hot coffee there is no way this will be a hot cup of coffee in 15 seconds. It should take closer to a minute with my microwave anyhow.",

I love anything pumpkin and am always looking for the next pumpkin recipe. However I am do not like coffee so this recipe for me was kind of a disappointment. I followed the measurements that were listed for the half and half sugar and pumpkin pie spice; however it was hard to taste anything over the strong coffee taste. I would suggest doubling the measurements just to have it taste more like pumpkin and to be sweeter. I used my keurig coffee brewer for this recipe. I believe that it was way easier. I just mixed the ingredients in one cup and then brewed the coffee right into that cup. Also I used regular whipped cream in a tub than in a can. I have always that whipped cream from a can tastes funny. To me the best part was to add a huge heaping spoon full of whipped cream to my latte. My fianc\u00e9e gave his approval for this recipe and thought that it was absolutely delicious. I guess it just depends on how much you like coffee.",
