He made it to the next round, but sadly I did not. This is my rendition of his soup. I made it my own by using butternut squash and sweet potato and made it richer by turning this into a bisque.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Please share your comments. For less-fat option substitute half-and-half with milk or nonfat half-and-half.",

We followed the recipe as written except that we used an immersion blender and added a dash of cinnamon at the end. Unless we missed it the recipe did not mention when to add the garlic, we did after the onion was translucent. 15 minutes of prep is a little misleading; it took my husband and I at least 30 minutes (but we are not master chefs).  Thanks for the recipe Donald.",

One no nutmeg instead I use cinnamon like everyone else suggested. two I didn't use the bacon. ultimately taste better without the bacon because it's too salty for something that comes out decently sweet. Also I roasted the sweet potatoes after tossing it in brown sugar coarse salt a little paprika and olive oil. I tossed the squash in paprika and coarse salt and olive oil instead of just pepper which got rid of that bland taste. Less milk (1cup) less stock (5 cups) makes it a little better so it's a nice solid bisque.",

I didn't have any wine so I omitted it and added a tablespoon each of butter and balsamic vinegar to compensate. I also only had heavy whipping cream on hand so I mixed 3/4 c of heavy whipping cream with 3/4 c of water and added it to the soup at the end. I also used an immersion stick blender instead of a standard blender it was silky smooth and way less messy. My husband isn't a fan of nutmeg so I served it with a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and the turkey bacon. We LOVED it and will definitely make it again. Next time I may add in a tart apple just for funsies because I think it could use the tartness (although the wine I didn't have may have added that acid).",
