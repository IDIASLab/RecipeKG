This is just heaven! \nI deviated somewhat from the original recipe by crushing onion & garlic croutons instead of the bland saltine crackers.

First mix the dry ingredients then mix in the oil; mix well. You will have some extra baking mix).",

The second time, I omitted the baking mix and added some basil and oregano.  Even better!  The third time, I used Panko bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese for the topping, left out the baking mix again(it really doesn't seem to add much or to affect recipe when omitted), and increased herbs slightly.  I think this is the variation I will stick with.  Thank you very much for a solid recipe using the ubiquitous squash of summer!",

I steamed the veggies in a microwave steamer for 7 minutes. No excess water that way and the veggies were nice and tender. The only other thing I did was to take some seasoned croutons and made crouton crumbs in the blender. I used those instead of the saltine cracker crumbs and bread crumbs. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Served it with our meal with our friends last night. EVERYONE (including me)loved it. There was none leftover! Only problem with that is that it would have been nice to have had some leftovers for today.",

I didn't have a lot of the ingredients it called for so I used what I had on hand, now I have a new easy and amazing recipe!   I used all squash, (didn't have zucchini) So 2lb cut squash, I  used 2cups,(the whole bag) of shredded cheddar cheese ,a box of cornbread dressing mix, 4 tsp sugar, a stick of melted butter, the 2 eggs,1tsp salt, and 1/2 onion-chopped, 1/2 cup half and half, i then mixed all this together in the casserole dish itself then covered with foil and baked it!  Oh, I did sprinkle with bread crumbs before I baked it, but that probably isn't even needed! It turned out awesome!  Bake  at 325 for  about 35 minutes.  So so so good! And......also very important it is quick and easy!",
