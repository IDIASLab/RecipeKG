So this is going to be my go to recipe when ever a last minute dessert is needed..\nI have made this dessert few times already, using peaches, plums and lately blackberries. The 1st couple of time making it, the jam leaked an made the pastry little bit soggy. Then I reduced the amount of jam, underneath the fruit, using less than half a teaspoon,  and that was perfect. The tartelettes were crispy and had plenty of taste and shine from the jam.",
