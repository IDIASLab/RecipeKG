Prior to adding in the cornstarch, water, vanilla extract, and lemon juice the raspberries had already reduced which thickened it enough. I chose to follow the recipe, and I added in the cornstarch mixture. I immediately regretted doing so because it thickened it so much I could no longer pour the compote on top of my waffles.",
