It took me two tries.  The first time, they rose nicely and were perfectly shaped.  But they were waaay too overdone, even at the shorter baking time of 10 minutes.  Into the trash they went.  Not to be defeated by a simple biscuit mix recipe, I immediately hauled everything back out to make them again.  This time I set the oven temperature 25 degrees lower and the timer to just nine minutes.  They were better, but still more brown and crispy on the bottom than they should have been.  They were tasty enough, but somewhat on the tough side.  I was curious at this outcome, and even more so after a simple Google search revealed this is a common cinnamon biscuit recipe (think woman with the initials \u201cBC\u201d among the host of them).  I found mixed reviews all over which surprised me since this recipe is supposedly \u201ctried and true\u201d and has been around a long time.  (I found the only difference in submitter\u2019s recipe was she calls for 1 tsp. of milk in the glaze, which wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway, rather than BC\u2019s recipe which calls for 1 T.)  Further, I found shortly after eating one, that it left a somewhat floury aftertaste.  These were average at best, and because I had to make biscuits twice just to have them result as only average, I\u2019d merely call this an experiment.",

If I were to make again I'd also add a little salt to the biscuit mixture. They hardly rise at all so be sure to not roll out the dough too thinly or you'll have something that looks more like a cookie rather than a biscuit. Sorry kzastrow for the unfavorable review but these were a bit of a disappointment in this house.",

First, I don't typically have baking mix on hand, so I used my tried and true biscuit recipe: 2 c. all purpose flour, 4 tsp. baking powder, 2 tsp. sugar, 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 c. shortening, 2/3 c. milk. I combined my dry biscuit ingredients along with the cinnamon/sugar mixture noted in  the raisin recipe. I cut in shortening, added milk and raisins, then kneaded 7 or 8 strokes. I rolled out to 1/2 inch thickness then cut with my cookie cutter. I baked in a 450 degree oven for 7 minutes, then adjusted the heat to 425 for an additional 4 minutes (on a baking stone).
