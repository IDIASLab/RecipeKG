If you are using frozen chicken just throw it into a pot and boil the breasts until done - you can even over-cook them at this process to tender them up. Once cooked drain the water and remove chicken. Shred or dice chicken then return to the same pot with onions and continue recipe from there (no need to add olive oil if you do it this way). By the way I was bummed I wasted the chipotles so many times so I discovered you can used dried chipotle powder instead and it is just as good!",

I usually add frozen corn and chicken breasts and add whole garlic cloves and rough chop my onion. I add a whole can of chipotle in adobe sauce but remove the chilies garlic clove and onion chucks at the end of cooking time. I place the chipotle garlic and onion in the blender and blend it into a sause. I love the soup as is but my husband loves to add my chipotle sauce in order to increase the heat. When serving this meal I always have bowls of extras at the table - home made chipotle sauce tortillas strips (for hearty tortilla soup) sour cream (for those like it creamier) and limes. A winner for busy moms and warms your body and soul on a cold day.",

Used a can of Rotel for more flavor; also added 1/4 crushed red pepper flakes 1/4 tsp. dried basil 1/2 tsp. ground cumin 1 tsp salt and one 4 oz. can chopped green chilies. Added a sprinkling of cornstarch to thicken it up a little. It was only after all of these additions did it seem like it would be enjoyable; before the changes it was bland and flavorless.",

I buy these cubes at my local \"natural organic market\". They are imported from Israel and come in a little tray that looks like a mini ice cube tray. It's kept in the freezer & easy to pop out a cube which is equal to one tsp of cilantro. Just add it to the broth. Yummy recipe and I serve it with refried bean & cheese quesadilla's.",
