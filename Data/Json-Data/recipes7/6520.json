My family members aren t buttercream fans so I made the frosting by whipping heavy cream with about 1/4 cup confectioner s sugar and a tsp of rum extract.. I placed a layer the whipped cream on the first layer the flaky coconut then piled on the second layer of cake Frosted all around the op and sides with the whipped cream and pressed more flaked coconut on top and all around the sides. Loved the idea of the green coconut nest. Filled that with jelly beans and placed some yellow and pink marshmallow peeps around the nest. It was a big hit. Made it twice during Easter week",
