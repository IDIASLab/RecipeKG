We used 3 cups rhubarb and 2 1/2 cups of strawberries.  The graham crax browned too easily before pie was done. We baked the crust first as well.  3min at 400 for the crust.  The pie tasted great with tastes blending well.  It was only slightly moist, falling apart but crust kept all together.  We will be doing this again- loved by all!  Thanks for a decent pie.",
