I used miracle whip instead of mayo, apple cider vinegar instead of white and half the sugar called for.  I used white onion (I didn't have any red ones, although I would have preferred that!!) and some cold left over frozen sweet peas as the ones in the can would be too mushy.  I used cucumber, and chopped boiled egg.  I made this at the last minute, as we decided to grill burgers on our grill, even though we are thigh deep in snow! Hahah!!  It was great even after 45 minutes in the fridge, but it was creamy.  We ate leftovers for lunch today and loved it even more!  Will definitely make again.  I have a family of 5 and by cutting the recipe in half, we didn't have too much leftover!",

I used lite mayo and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I used 2 Tbsp. of mustard, one yellow and one dijon and next time I might cut back on that just a bit.  I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 4 hard boiled eggs.  I left out the green pepper and used a bunch of chopped green onions.  I did add the carrots and a 5 oz. jar of drained and chopped green olives with pimento peppers.  This reminds me a lot of what my Grandma used to make every summer.",

                "reviewBody": "Classic is the key word here ... nothing to pretty it up, nothing to add additional flavors, nothing to create a \"change\" ... just a perfect, classic recipe everyone will love!  I not only think its perfect as is, but is also the best base for getting crazy with your own preferences.  Here are a few suggestions/hints I have found to be helpful ... some reviews have mentioned it too runny, too sweet, too much onion, or needing some chopped egg, I personally found the \"runny\" dressing to substancially thicken up overnight in the fridge, but if you are serving within an hour or two of making, I'd suggest tossing with partial dressing and saving the rest to add if necessary just prior to serving that way you control the wetness.  I actually prefer adding a bit of dressing to give it a little fresh kick just before the serve.  As for the sugar, I have found a little less is needed if you use white vinegar and mayo, but all is needed if using apple cider and miracle whip. It also aids in the consistency of the dressing.  To somewhat counter the bite of the onion I chop it a bit fine to blend in better as I'm not a fan of chunky onion bites, but certainly using less is an easy fix. As for the chopped egg, its one of those preference things but often a \"must\" for some so throw it in there. Same with adding cheese, or mini shrimp, or other veggies, there is no limit to personalizing this perfect start.  But, for a fresh, classic macaroni salad, you won't go wrong with \"as is\" either!",
