Whereas the previous biscuits were too heavy on the garlic and cheese these gratefully had neither of those issues. I did however skip the \"Italian\" seasoning which I am not a fan of. In its place I substituted fresh chopped dill. These baked up fluffy and plump nice flavors none overbearing.",

Today was gloomy and cold so we cooked up some ham and potato soup and baked these biscuits per recipe but with slightly different seasoning. Fresh rosemary was used in place of the Italian seasoning. The biscuits were fluffy full of flavor and a delicious compliment to soup. We will be making these again soon!",
