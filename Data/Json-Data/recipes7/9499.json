My husband and I thought the salad was delicious. It is good with or without the sesame seeds. I tasted the salad before I added them, and I think I liked it better. My husband likes it with them--it adds an Asian zing--so you can't go wrong either way. I will be making this salad often.",

I liked this because it was not sweet, and the tang of the lemon and vinegar came out!  I didn't have parsley, so used a bit of green pepper for an accent color.  When pumpkins are in season, this will be wonderful to replace the carrots with pumpkin!  This is a great recipe!  Thanks!",

Next time I'll try some sweet apple and half the lemon or vinegar to see how I like it. The recipe is well worth trying just to be amazed of how much punch the tiny tiny sesame seeds contributes tho;D I was very surprised and pleasantly so. Remember to roast them for the full experience!",

I also used olive oil instead of safflower and a regular apple (I think a Braeburn) instead of a Granny Smith.  I didn't shred the apple or carrots--instead I used a vegetable peeler and made \"ribbons.\"  The dressing completely overwhelmed the apples and carrots.  I think the concept is good but it would be better if the apples were finely diced; maybe do the same with the carrots; cut the dressing in half; maybe add some craisins, raisins, or other dried fruit.",

Not all that complicated uses ingredients that just from reading the list you KNOW will be fabulous together but you'd never tried it till you saw it somewhere. THANK YOU for being the one to think of it! I didn't have Granny Smiths which tend to be huge so I used two Pink Lady apples instead. And I pretty much use olive oil for everything so of course used that instead of safflower along with the dried parsley I go through by the bushel. I loved it so much that when I moved it from the tossing bowl to the serving bowl I grabbed a spoon to snarf up the last of the shredded goodness and the juices that had mixed with the dressing. Served with saut\u00e9ed shrimp and quinoa with a little EVOO and balsamic vinegar with chopped almonds and dried cranberries. SUCH a lovely easy dinner!",
