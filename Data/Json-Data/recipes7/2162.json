I had an 8\" pie crust so I ended up getting rid of all the excess liquid that was left with the cooked mango and strawberries. I also omitted the nutmeg. I thought there was way too much crumb mixture (even though I didn't use all of it). If I was to do this pie again I would probably not do the crumb mixture and just use a regular pie crust on top.",
