I used this recipe for my mom's 70th birthday as a surprise. I thought I could adjust the recipe based on the suggestions of previous reviews but the cake was terrible to hard to cut. The only thing that I improved was the lemon flavor but the cake itself was not moist and fluffy and just too stiff. Too much work for such a great disappointment! It took me 3 hours to complete. Unless you are a pretty confident baker and know how to adjust the recipe for your benefit I suggest just using an entirely different recipe.

The cake itself came out somewhat dry I don't think I overworked it but I could have done so. They show frosting in the picture but there is no frosting recipe with this cake.
