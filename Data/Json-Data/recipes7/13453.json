I think the rum is an important ingredient in this recipe but if you don t want to add the alcohol I d recommend adding rum extract. And if you re watching your calories I think sugar substitutes would work well in this recipe. Do give it time to chill because the flavor improves. Sam Nemati thanks for sharing your recipe.",

But it lacks the creaminess I'm used to, however this can easily be created by playing with your milk ingredients replacing part of the milk with cream and or condensed milk. As is it's a great lower fat recipe my family loved it!",
