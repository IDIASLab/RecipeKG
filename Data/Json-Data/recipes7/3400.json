I did tweak it a bit, but I do not recommend omitting any of the flavors in this recipe, they are all vital for it to taste good.  I used frozen strawberries and omitted the ice cubes. I doubled the amount of the fresh basil because I love the flavor so much I wanted more. I used Cuervo Gold tequila and orange flavored triple sec. I did up the alcohol amount, but I don't know by how mush because I tripled the recipe and then just kept adding to taste. VERY flavorful and refreshing, not to mention a serving of berries :D  I will be making this again and as often as I can get away with it. It deserves 10 stars.",

One thing I added that really blends well with all margaritas is some simple syrup and one squeezed lime.  Simple syrup is just like it sounds, simple.  Add one part water and one part sugar (I cut the sugar in half with splenda).  Bring to a boil, stir, and then let cool.  With this recipe, about 1/4 cup worked very well.  It also keeps in the fridge for a long time, so better to make about a cup at a time.",

I used fresh basil picked directly from our garden - and wasn't real sure how big \"large\" leaves are. Some of our basil gets pretty big! I used what I would consider to be medium sized leaves and it was still overpowering. I also used strawberries from our garden that had been frozen first. The flavor of the strawberries with the basil is good but I don't want to taste the basil that much. I'm going to try this again next weekend but only add a couple of small basil leaves (to \"complement\" the strawberry flavor) and I'll add more ice so I can enjoy this drink longer and the alcohol won't be so strong.",
