The flavors all come together but it reminds me more of a bbq dip for chicken nuggets or fries then a grilling bbq type sauce. It is kind of like a spicy orange mustard sauce. I liked how quick it is to mix up though with only using one bowl. It is with such common cupbard staples also. A kid might find this a little too tart or hot I think with the seasonings. However us adults I am sure will find it fine for dipping chicken etc.",
