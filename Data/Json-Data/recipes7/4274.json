This dish reminds me of the delicious potato dish or curry I ve tried in my local Indian restaurant. But this was even better. I didn t have fennel seeds and asafoetida so I omitted them. Very delicious. UPDATE 26/04/2011 I just want to add that this dish is a staple in my house I make it almost every two weeks. I think this is the best way to prepare potatoes so far.",

I happened upon this one and noting it originated with a Gujarati mama I decided to give it a whirl. Wow! I made this for dinner tonight and boy am I glad I did. Curry is one of my favorite smells and just sauteing the herbs and spices for this made me hungry! The recipe was very straight forward--I didn't have a few of the spices I'd run out--and the dish still came out excellently. The potatoes are perfectly cooked the gravy is warm spicy and earthy and served over fragrant rice it is to die for. My kids ate every last bite (even the picky one) and even the dog wanted some. (I didn't give him any as I hadn't checked the spice list fully). What's the best part? It took just a few minutes to prep and while it cooked the rice steamed in our rice cooker. Everything was done at the exact same time to perfection. I will definitely be making this again for many many years to come--especially on rainy or cold evenings when a quick warm filling meal is in order.",
