First the ingredients call for 9\" crust, but directions say 8\" - I used 8\". The recipe states 1/2 cup butter - this turned out to be too much! You use just as much butter as strawberries. Needless to say, it did not turn out right. It cooked fine, looked beautiful on the outside, but very little taste on the inside. I also used fresh rhubarb, cut up, and 10 minutes was too long to cook it for.",

Smelled Good, crunch crust, smooth taste and nice mix sweet/sour.  When other recipes complained of too much filling, could have been 3 eggs instead of 2 and too much sugar like 1 1/2 cups.
