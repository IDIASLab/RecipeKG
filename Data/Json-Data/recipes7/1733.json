The only change I made was to add a little water to the beaten egg. I'm not sure it would coat an entire pound of frog legs otherwise. One part of this recipe puzzled me: it calls for chili paste or chili sauce. After getting some guidance on the Recipe Exchange I went shopping for some Asian Chili Sauce. I bought two types sweet and hot divided the sauce and made some of each. Both were delicious. I will make this recipe again even though I couldn't convince any one else to try it. Maybe next time!",
