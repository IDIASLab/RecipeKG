Wanted to let you know that if you have leftover hamburger, hotdog buns or rolls for sub sandwiches, you can split them and toast on a tray in the oven and use up that extra bread in making this bread pudding.  Works just as well and a good way to use up bread before you have to feed it to the birds or toss it.  1/2 of a burger, hotdog or sub roll will equasl one slice of farmhouse-style bread.",

My fault tho, not the recipe's. If I use reg bread again, I think I would use at least 6 extras, possibly even more. The vanilla sauce is totally different than other vanilla sauce I've had/made before. It's thicker, like a thinned out pudding, so it kind of spreads over the bread pudding, instead of soaking down into the bread. It threw me at first but I really liked it! 1 more note, I put mine into a 3 qt dish because that's what I had availble. It baked perfectly in that size, puffing up over the top, but not spilling over & I didn't have to cover it at all, it was perfectly golden. Of course, it deflated while cooling(normal). I'm not sure mine would've fit into a 2 qt dish, as called for in the recipe.",

I didn't have farm house bread, but the recipe said to use a \"hearty\" style bread, so I used bread from a homemade loaf I made the other day. I only had a small 1.5 oz box of raisins, and just used that. I don't care for raisins that much anyway. After 1 hour of baking I noticed the bread had risen to the top and the sauce was on the bottom. I stirred it lightly and then put it back in the oven for 10 minutes, and it thickened up fine. The bread pudding was very sweet, like I had said, so I do wish I would have cut back the sugar some. The sauce did have a nice brown sugar and vanilla taste. However, it is also really sweet and does thicken up almost immedietely after it cools just slightly. It might have to be thinned out a little, with some milk or cream, especially if using it the next day.",

I used a large loaf of Italian bread cut into 1 1/2\" cubes, well toasted in the preheating oven for about 10 minutes.  I think that's the secret to it not being overly soggy.  Used 2 1/2 C skim milk plus 1/2 C half & half in the pudding part, and in the sauce 1 C skim milk and 1/4 C half & half.  Plenty rich.  Will make this often!",
