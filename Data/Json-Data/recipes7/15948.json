The dough is easy to work with even though it is on the softer side I used the size small pampered chef cookie scoop and they dispensed with ease. These are definitely better the next day. 1/2 tsp lemon extract seemed like a small amt. for the size batch. I added the zest of one lemon and I'm glad I did. When I tasted them after they cooled they were nothing special in taste; very mild even with the zest. The texture is wonderful though as others have stated. They are pillowy soft and delicate. They are not overly sweet even with the sugar sprinkled on top. The next morning I tasted them again and they did taste a bit more lemony. these could easily withstand a light lemon glaze without being overpowering. I used fresh grated nutmeg which I prefer for better nutmeg flavor. It is slight but there. I would make these again using a light lemon glaze and some non-pareil sprinkles for presentation. On a cookie tray they are a bit bland looking.",

I already had the rest of the dry ingredients sifted together so I decided to go ahead with the amount of sugar that I had. Boy am I glad I did!!!! This is my new all-time favorite cookie recipe. I was about half a cup short of sugar to put in the dough and then didn't have any to sprinkle on top. These wonderful cookies do not need the extra sugar. Thanks so much for this recipe. It will be my go-to cookie recipe from now on!",
