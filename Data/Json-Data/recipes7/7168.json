So I'll expand and say that not only were these made in no time they were soft and tender with that characteristic sandy texture so familiar in cookies where cream of tartar is one of the ingredients. I HATE rolling out sugar cookies and these had the advantage of turning out perfectly round perfect for decorating. I glazed them with \"Shiny Cookie Icing \" also from this site before decorating them for Halloween. I'm very pleased.",

I was looking for the perfect soft cookie recipe and I found it. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very tasty but the texture was a little off. There were a lot of holes in them so the second time I made them I mixed the vanilla extract in with the wet ingredients and then sifted all of the dry ingredients together well in a separate bowl and then blended it all together with an electric mixer. They turned out perfect! Sugary sweet and soft. Make sure you take them out of the oven before they brown so you get a soft cookie! This is my go to sugar cookie recipe now.",

Also with my convection oven (which I'm still learning how to use) 2 batches at 300 (automatically switched down to 275 on convection setting) it took about 22 minutes for them to puff up nicely still before browning.
