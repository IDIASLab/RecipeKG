I think this would also be good with the addition of some cinnamon nutmeg and either walnuts or almonds. Really good bread though and not overly sweet. Definitely would make this again! I made mine in a 9x5\" loaf pan and it was perfectly done in 60 minutes at 350.",

Used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, used 1/2 cup whole flour with 1 1/2 cups white four, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to enhance the flavor a bit.  Tasty",
