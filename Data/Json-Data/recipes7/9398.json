The second one I made exactly as written with one substitution: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter. It too was absolutely delicious and the butter (and all those extra calories) was not missed one little bit. So I give this two thumbs up whichever way you choose to make it, but I will be making it with the apple sauce to keep it healthy and light but just as delicious!! If you want to take this recipe uptown just a bit, add some chopped walnuts - yum!!",

Also, this definitely needed the 1/4 tsp. of salt I added that was glaringly absent in the ingredients list.  In addition, this needed closer to an hour to bake thoroughly, so I'd call the instruction to bake 30-40 minutes way off. I think this would benefit with the addition of one more apple and 2 T. of vegetable oil.",

I used the pink lady apples and the cake is very apple-y and delicious! I added a full teaspoon salt to the batter which really helped to intensify the flavors, and it took 1 hour in my oven. For those who had problems with this, remember all ovens are different and cook times will vary. I recommend setting for 40 minutes and checking. If it is at all jiggly or squishy on top you want to keep baking. Add another 5 or 10 minutes and keep checking until top is firm-ish. For those who found it dry be sure you are measuring your flour properly. Spoon it into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife. You might be packing it too much. This cake would be hard to dry out with all the delicious apple in it! Thanks for a great recipe Jinglebells! It's a keeper!",

Since all my loaf recipes call for an hour of baking, mine was in the oven for an hour and came out exactly like the picture - it raised to the top of the pan and didn't deflate.  I chopped up the apples in my Pampered Chef chopper so my apple pieces were very small/tiny. I also folded the flour mixture into the creamed mixture with a spatula (not the electric mixture), added the milk as instructed and folded that in. As best as I can describe its doneness is when the cake part that seeps through the top is tan and has a dry look to it. \n I also learned that I should have left a margin of cake batter between the brown sugar mix and the cake pan, otherwise, if the brown sugar seeps out on the sides, it turns very hard.
