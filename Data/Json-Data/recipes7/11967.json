You can substitute butter for the shortening and skip the tartar (which can produce a \"tinny\" taste) but it might also alter the shape of the cookie.  If you like a little more spice, add a little more cinnamon or some pumpkin pie spice.  **I wasn't intending to rate this recipe, just wanted to make this note.**",
