The egg/rice balance is really important - we generally mix the egg and milk then add rice a bit at a time to be sure we keep things from getting too dry. It needs to be a little soupy for the egg to hold it all together when cooked up. I think day-old rice is better here (just like with fried rice) because of the change in consistency. Also try leaving out the onion putting a bit of salt on them when frying then top them with syrup. We've always done this as a sweet breakfast and not a savory snack. mmmm (either way)",
