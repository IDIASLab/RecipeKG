She thought and went right and got the muffin pan; I told her we're in business! Top with syrup of your choice and some of the whipped  topping, sprinkle some powder sugar, and serve. You can add anything you want. This is a great recipe for children when trying to make pancakes for everybody in the house. You can have your muffin and eat it too.",
