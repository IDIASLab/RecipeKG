I waited 40 minutes (instead of 45) to check with the \"freezer\" method and it was done.  Did not use pectin either.  Made 3 x 8 oz. jars and 1 x 12 oz. jar.  Will be making more, Thank you Art for a great jam recipe\nUpdate:  After giving the jam time to \"breathe\" tried it and will be making a couple of changes:  1.  use 3 1/2 cups of white sugar (instead of 4) 2.  \"boil\" 35 minutes.  Reason is too sweet and too tough (will make it again )",
