I chose to add the full amount of margerine called for in this recipe in the actual cornbread and make muffins out of them--I just sprayed each muffin cup lightly with non-stick cooking spray. I got 10 cornbread muffins out of one recipe. They looked beautiful but did not rise as much as I would have liked. My family liked this cornbread recipe but they did spread a small amount of margerine and drizzled a little organic honey over their cut muffins before digging in. I'd make these again.",

Here is the deal - if you are going to break up this cornbread in your chili soup etc. - it's great! But I didn't necessarily like this by itself. But I didn't hate it. Just like the original much better - like I want to eat that all alone! Will make this again though if we are eating with something where we are going to crumble the cornbread into our meal.:-)",
