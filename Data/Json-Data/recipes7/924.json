If you want to use Splenda to make it sugar free that would work as well.  I will probably try that next time.  I also used olive oil instead of  vegetable oil.  Instead of the Chicken Ramen Noodles, I used Oriental.  This flavor seems to compliment this recipe more so.  One last change I made to the dressing was adding the packet of orienal seasoning mix to the actual dressing and not the nut mix.  This makes it much more flavorful.  When I sauteed the nut mix I only used 1/4 cup butter.  Just trying to cut back on the fat and it works!  My kids love this! \n",

I do have some tips that I hope will help-break the noodles up into small pieces so they toast evenly make sure the sugar is well blended into the dressing ingredients add the dressing a little at a time to the salad mixing well after each addition and make this in a very large bowl. I did toast the nuts separately and advise that you wait until the nuts and noodles are cool before adding them to the slaw.",

I had to double the recipe for the amount of people at the cookout, so instead of broccoli I used 2 bags of Broccoli Slaw and 1 bag of cole slaw. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing for a little kick. I will be making this for years!!!",

After reading all the reviews this is what I did:I used the oriental flavored noodles and also only put 1/2 of 1 flavor packet on the noodles and almonds as they cooked; the rest I put into the dressing. I also used a little less than 1/3 cup of sugar and I thought it was just sweet enough. Couldn't find unsalted sunflower seeds so I used about 1/2 cup of seasame seeds instead. I substituted about 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar in the 1/4 cup of cider vinegar and I used less than half of a small head of red and green cabbage and maybe less than half a cup of shredded carrots instead of bagged coleslaw. Everyone loved it and have already requested that I make it for future get togethers.",

And the ramen noodle people try to tell us that there are 2 servings in each package. Now I don't know about anyone else but I can put away one whole package with no trouble at all. So even though this salad appears to be healthy is isn't not really. But this salad is so darned delicious that it's worth it! I did try to cut calories and fat a little by toasting the nut/noodle mixture in 2 tablespoons of butter instead half a cup. I used 1/4 cup of splenda instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar and I only put about a third of a cup of oil in the dressing I made up the difference with water. I don't know how these changes affected the outcome of the salad but they made me feel better. The salad was still delicious and we enjoyed it immensely. Thanks for the post Busy Mom of 3.
