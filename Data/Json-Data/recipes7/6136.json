        "description": "Whoopie Pies are one of those comfort foods that make you want more than one. They just don't get any better. Though Whoopie Pies can be delicious any old way...the preferred way to have them is about 5-10 minutes out of the freezer. Tall glass of milk and one of these Whoopies...you will not have a care in the world!  The frosting is phenomenal, but make sure you remember that when making it, it will look like a real mess until you've beaten it on high for at least five minutes.  Sometime after that it will become like nothing you've seen or eaten. This makes a big batch and is easily halved.",

It does take some time to bake all the cookies but then just have the kids or grandkids match sizes together. The filling was a cinch...just make sure you don't start it at high right away or you'll have milk flying everywhere! You'll notice it's runny in the beginning but as it mixes just speed it up and after a few minutes it turns into a beautiful white fluff!!! I've grown up around Whoopie Pies and Shoofly pie living here in the PA Dutch area and I'm very picky and this recipe ranks up there with Mom's whoopie pie recipe. I had always wanted to try a filling made with marshmallow creme. I skipped the wrapping and freezing part as these will all be eaten this week. Thanks Teresa! Until finding your recipe I didn't know whoopie pies were even made in Maine. Thought only us in PA ate them!",

The cake had a nice chocolate flavor and was very moist which was nice because a lot of whoopie pies come out dry. They didn't rise very much but they were very good and I would make them again. Make sure you butter your pan well or use parchment paper because they do stick. The frosting was a mess! It was very runny. I followed the directions exactly and even took the suggestion of other reviewers to beat longer because it would thicken. I beat the filling for ten minutes and it never thickened. I even put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and it still stayed runny. I also thought the use of white sugar left a terrible grainy texture that did not go away. I ended up throwing out the filling and using a marshmallow filling from a different recipe. The cake part I would easily give a 4 but the frosting would be a zero.",
