The store had it labeled as sweet purple potatoes and the produce person said that it was the same thing, called differently in other countries. They are smaller than a sweet potato and ended buying about 6 of them. I had enough to double the recipe and used the full 13.66 oz can of coconut milk , 1% milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 packet of gelatin. After making it, I placed it in a big bowl and left it in the fridge for 4 hours. I wanted a thicker consistency so I placed it in the freezer for over a hour before eating. It's so good and creamy. However, the coconut milk over powered the taste. The next time I make this, I will just use 1/2 a can of coconut milk. otherwise, this is a winner. Thanks!",
