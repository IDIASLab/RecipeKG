It did not turn out very liquid; more like a dressing than a vinaigrette, but man was it delicious.  It got 12 thumbs up among our party of 6.  Five stars with the corrected ratios.",

Strawberries make this vinaigrette thick and creamy, with just a delicate flavor of the strawberry. There is not enough vinegar for this to be a classic vinaigrette dressing. That being my desire, I added 3 Tbsp tarragon white wine vinegar since I didn't want it to be overpowered by so much balsamic. Other than that, the only other change I made was to use 1/2 as much salt. Make certain you use extra virgin olive oil or else the result may end to oily.  In the end it was a lightly flavored dressing that went very well on a tossed Spring salad, everyone at the adult table was very pleased.",
