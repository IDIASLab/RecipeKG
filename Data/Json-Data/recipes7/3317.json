After trial and error, I think mine comes very close to his. This haute cuisine sauce makes everyday steaks or roasts into something a little more elegant. Serve atop grilled steaks, hamburger steaks, roasted beef or venison. Bon Appetite!",

Hubs and I enjoyed this to accompany our steaks tonight and it was as if the two were meant to be together! (And we don't like sauces of ANY kind with our steaks!)  Rich, dark and hearty, with full, robust flavor. My only criticism is with the addition of the cornstarch, which is neither traditional nor necessary. In hindsight I'd eliminate it altogether, simply reducing the sauce further until the desired thickness.  Also in hindsight, I would skip the salt - there is obviously plenty in the beef broth.  The thyme is the perfect seasoning, much better, in my view, on its own than with the rosemary I expected to be with it.  Great sauce - the two of us cleaned it up!",

I'd been on a \"eh, it tastes okay\" cooking streak, and I wanted to impress my boyfriend with a really great meal. THIS IS IT. I followed the recipe exactly, and was liberal with the salt and pepper where they say \"to taste.\" The sauce was robust with flavor; the texture was satiny smooth; I licked the gravy boat and wished I had made more. My boyfriend proclaimed this \"fantastic\" and was still talking about it the day afterward. And, the best part was, this recipe was incredibly easy. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to make a WOW meal. One suggestion--the recipe, as it's written, makes enough gravy for two, maybe three people; I would double it for 4+ dinner guests.",
