I recommend that you take your time to press the fruit through the strainer when straining out the seeds.  I used a spatula and pressed on the mixture and dragged the spatula.  It's very thick, so you'll need to scrape the fruit off the underside of the strainer (I used a regular soup spoon).  It was a bit time consuming (took a few extra minutes), but I think the result was excellent.   Very easy recipe and it made enough to fill the inside of my 9-inch chocolate cake layers.  The flavor combination was incredible and everyone raved about how delicious it was.  Thank you so much!",

When it was time to go on cake it was clearly far too runny and watery. Perhaps I didn't let it reduce enough? At least it is delicious and goes really well on top of vanilla ice cream waffles etc.",

I used frozen raspberries so I also reduced the water to 1/3 cup.  While changes were made, the spirit of the recipe was maintained. This is sublime. Not only did I use this in a cake, I have used it on PB&J sandwiches, and filled thumbprint cookies with the last bit of it.

The  ration  of cornstarch to water to make a gravy is 2 T cornstarch  to 2 cups liquid....so.....you can see that more constarch  is  needed here.  Otherwise...it's fine as a sauce.",
