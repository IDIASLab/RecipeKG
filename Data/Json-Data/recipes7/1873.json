I was suspicious of a couple of things when I started but my brulee experience is limited - so I wasn't sure I knew enough to start questioning the recipe. I should have anyway. I think there is an error in the amount of cream. Even scaling this recipe down to 4 servings I ended up with 6 - and my ramekins are larger than 6oz (I also think if the cream amount was corrected that there may be a better chocolate ratio to this). The cooking time is either too long or the oven temp is too high. I pulled mine out of the oven after 15 minutes because it started to bubble(!). There isn't quite enough chocolate in this which was okay when I garnished it with more - but not really okay on its own. I think adding a block or two of chocolate to the Creme Brulee recipe on this site is the route I'll go next time if I want a chocolate brulee. Thanks for the recipe anyway! We ended up enjoying it.:)",
