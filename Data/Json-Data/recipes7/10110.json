I must say that I think 400 degrees is too high to bake such a delicate cookie.  I baked mine at 350 for 9 minutes, and they were perfect.  They were light on the bottom and perfectly set.  I don't like the taste of glaze made with lemon juice (too tart), so I made my glaze with powdered sugar, water, and added lemon extract (and tinted it yellow), so it made a very pretty cookie (glaze had a nice lemon flavor without being so sour).

Did not have lemon extract, so used vanilla extract, and about twice as much of (real) lemon juice.  Added about a tablespoon of minced lemon zest.  Made the glaze with just lemon juice and powdered sugar, and added the glaze while cookies were warm -- this makes the glaze seep into the cookie.  Very delicate flavor and texture.  Plus, I won an awesome Santa dishtowel!!!  Thanks to the nice lady who posted this recipe!  =)",

I did make a lemon glaze and drizzle on top, and it was very tasty. The cookies turned out moist and had a great texture, however the bottoms got very brown, very quickly - and I baked on parchment lined cookie sheets. I even cut the time down to 8 minutes of baking but the bottoms just got really dark, almost burnt. I used a tablespoon size cookie scoop and I got exactly 30, uniform cookies. They still get four stars though because my kids really liked them.",

I didn't have any lemon extract so I used 1 fresh lemon. Using the zest of a whole lemon and put that in the dough along with the juice of half the lemon in place of the extract. That made the dough too wet, so I just added a little extra flour until it looked right....about 2-3 Tbls. I also made a lemon drizzle: juice of half of lemon, 1/4 C. powdered sugar,    1/4 C. Heavy whipping cream and 1 Tsp. butter (softened) mixed with electric mixer on high speed to desired consistency. Cake like cookie, melts in your mouth!! Thanks for such a great recipe ;)",
