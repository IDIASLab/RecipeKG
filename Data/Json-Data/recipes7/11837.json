I added the following :  one  14.5 oz. can of Hunt's Stewed Tomatoes (large chop) and 1/2 lb. container of fresh sliced mushrooms.  Instead of using 2 cups of water, I used one cup of chicken stock and one cup of water.  I also added more fresh garlic.  Finally, the recipe stated to add the cut potatoes and cook for the last 40 minutes.  There is not any cut potatoes on the planet that takes 40 minutes to cook.  Cook the stew for 15 minutes more and then add the potatoes for the last 25 mins.",
