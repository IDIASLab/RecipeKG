I scaled this recipe down to 12 servings and since I wanted portion control I baked in my mini bundt muffin pan for 18 minutes at 350\u00ba. Garnished with a dollop of chocolate whipped cream and Fragola Pazzo strawberries a recipe from this site. They baked up beautifully and they do have a bit of brownie flavor to them. dutchgirl some times good things happen even when you realize you ve screwed up the recipe and this is one of them.",
