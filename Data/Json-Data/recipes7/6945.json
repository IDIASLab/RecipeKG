I substituted soured milk for the buttermilk and sunflower oil for the bacon drippings. Instead of cornmeal I used maize meal which is a staple food in South Africa and can be cooked in a variety of ways and served for breakfast with milk and sugar or with a tomato& onion sauce as a side dish with meat. The batter was a bit thick and I dabbed it on with a spoon twirling the stick as I went along. I also twirled the dog in the hot oil for a bit before letting it go to fry on one side til golden and turned it to the other side. They came out really yummy and were polished off before I could take a photo??",
