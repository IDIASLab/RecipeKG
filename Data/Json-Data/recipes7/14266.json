I bought the ingredients and didn't get around to making the jam as planned, so when I decided to make it, I realized I did not have fresh pears. I substituted one cup of smooth, unsweetened applesauce. I didn't cook it for the initial 15-20 minutes because I didn't want to over cook the apples. I simply cooked it with the lid on until a lot of liquid was released. I also only used four cups of sugar and it is plenty sweet. Thank you!",

I used regular raisins, but wish I'd used the golden ones (these look like little bugs in my jam!)   With those modifications, I got about 8 half pints.  So tasty!  Will absolutely make this again.  **Added a year later**  I just made the recipe as written.  It was just as good, but a lot more work.  I will continue making it - just with the applesauce as opposed to the pears.",
