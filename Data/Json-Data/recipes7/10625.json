Next time I think I will add a bit of rum for a little extra kick. Thanks so much for this keeper of a recipe!!",

I liked the flavor but I do think I would skip the apple next time for a more pure eggnog flavor. Flavor did develop further as the custard chilled. and we preferred it cold. Will def make this next eggnog season. Thanks for sharing!",

My grandmother who is quite the bread pudding snob even said it was the best she ever tasted. I now have to make it for her every year when I visit for Christmas. I have made it several times now and I have tweaked it a bit. I now add a shot or two of Bourbon to the egg and eggnog mixture. I also sprinkle the top with cinnamon. My mom likes to add soaked raisins when she makes it. Also great with a handful of walnuts or chocolate chips or both. Have fun exploring and I hope you enjoy making this for your family as much as I do. So glad I came across this recipe years ago it has now become a family holidays staple!",
