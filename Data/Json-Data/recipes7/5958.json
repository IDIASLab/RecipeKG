I have baked it in a 9 x13 inch pan when that was what was available and it is still good. I have added cinnamon to the cake or icing for a little different flavor.  I have made it without nuts in the icing for people who don't like nuts and have made it half with nuts in the icing and half without ( just pour some icing on half the cake and add nuts to the remaining icing and spread on the other half).  I have a friend who makes it with regular milk not buttermilk.  It is a very forgiving cake.  Since the cake is very moist I have never tried layers.  I use the same saucepan for the icing I use for the cake.  I have seen this named Sheath Cake, Texas Sheet Cake and 22 minute cake. Happy cooking!",

I add extra cocoa, usually about a half cup total, and have even used the dark cocoa, that is really good.  On my birthday I always want the \"Mississippi Mud\" version-(my mom's)  when the cake comes out of the oven, (baked in 9x13 pan) spread a jar of marshmallow cream over it while it is still very warm.  Then make the frosting with the nuts, and once the marshmallow has cooled very carefully spread the frosting over the marshmallow.  Yes, very decadent- thats why I want it for my birthday!  I have shared this recipe more than any other over the years- everyone enjoy!",

I used a 10x15 sheet pan and it fit perfectly. Once you pour the batter into the pan be sure to pick pan up about and inch from the counter and drop to the counter a few times to pop the air bubbles. I forgot to do that and ended up with a very unevenly baked cake. I always pour the warm frosting over a warm cake. It's just the way I learned to make a cake like this. I left the pecans out of the frosting and toasted them in a dry non-stick skillet before adding them to the top of the cake.",

I used cake flour (if you do this be sure to add an extra 2 T. for every cup of flour) I also warmed the butter and water in the microwave and then added the cocoa powder (used and extra T of cocoa too). Lastly I turned them into cupcakes instead of using a jellyroll pan. If you do this be sure not to overfill the cupcake molds because I overfilled a couple and although it wasn't disastrous batter was overflowing out the middle of a couple of them. All in all the cupcakes turned out fine but I didn't find the cake itself to be all that chocolaty. I think next time I'd add even more cocoa powder or even some chocolate chips might add a lot to this recipe. Granted I did not use the frosting recipe on here instead I used a vanilla frosting so I'm sure using a chocolate frosting would help too. I used vanilla because I decorated them with Christmas sprinkles and I thought the sprinkles would pop more on the vanilla instead of the chocolate. Also this recipe yielded about 20 cupcakes and they cooked for about 20-25 minutes.",
