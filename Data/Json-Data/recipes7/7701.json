I do have my criticisms of this recipe, but they\u2019re no biggies and don\u2019t detract from the resulting muffin at all.  First, don\u2019t bother measuring out 1-1/2 c. of the pumpkin. After doing so there was so little left in the 15 oz. can that I just used all of it.  Second, I found that just 1/4 c. of raisins was skimpy \u2013 so I added another 1/4 cup.  My remaining criticisms are slightly more important.  As I looked over the ingredients and then the batter itself, I could see this was going to make way more than 18 muffins; and so it did.  I got 24 perfectly sized and rounded muffins.  The instructions to make the streusel are unconventional, so I chose to prepare it in the standard manner of mixing the flour and sugar, adding the butter until crumbly (I use a fork) and finally the oats.  Because there were 24 muffins, not 18, I was short of topping and had no motivation to drag things out again to make another batch.  I had enough to top 12 muffins very nicely and chose to leave the other 12 without. With or without topping, they\u2019re lovely.  They\u2019re light and fluffy, not heavy and dense.  Without streusel they\u2019d be great with cream cheese frosting, but they\u2019re just perfect as is.  They\u2019re gorgeous too, and just as delicious as they are pretty, not overly sweet and lightly spiced, so the pumpkin unmistakably takes center stage.  Bonus:  the topping actually stays put!",

So moist and great flavor, the only thing I would do differently is add some chopped pecans to the streusel...other than that perfect!\r\nUpdate: I added a cream cheese filling to these muffins and it worked out perfectly! I made the filling out of: 8 ounces cream cheese, softened, 1 cup powdered sugar & 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I then placed the mixture on plastic wrap and made a log out of it, wrapped it up and put in the freezer for a few hours and then just sliced it when I needed it to put in the center of the muffin batter. So good!",

Make sure to double the streusel mixture. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans to the streusel; so glad I did! I found that the minis had the perfect balance of streusel-to muffin for optimal flavor; de-friggin'-liscious! I've Pinned the recipe and will be making these numerous times this fall. Great to make, store half to eat within a few days and freeze the rest. Then, as you want a muffin or two, remove from freezer and heat in microwave. Thanks for sharing!",

Just a few things, as noted in the other reviews and I feel the same way...double the raisins,  use the whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and you MUST double the streusel topping!  I ended up with 24 muffins, but I suppose it depends on the size of your muffin cups.  I filled my cups almost to the top, leaving only enough room for the topping and they came out looking great.

You can't go wrong making theses muffins. Only thing different I did was to add a little more pumpkin spice, oatmeal and double the streusel topping( a must have).

I wanted to update it to mention (since I am not a huge fan of cleaning my muffin tin and I don't like wasting paper & aluminum for the cups) that a single recipe makes two perfect loaves (my Pyrex dishes are 8.5\"x4.5\").  When I bake this recipe I use cream cheese filling (8 oz. cream cheese + 1 c. confectioner's sugar + 1 tsp vanilla) and add pecans to the streusel.  Plus, I really like the flavor of the raisins with the pumpkin so I increase them to 1/2 cup.  I still bake the loaves at 350 but it takes at least an hour in my oven to set up.
