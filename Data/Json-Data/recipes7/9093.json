I located this 5 Minute Slaw in my recipe box and whipped it up. Then as I finished reading the recipe I realized I was supposed to let it marinate 4-6 hours. Hmmm not 5 minutes after all! No time for refrigerating! And that was my fault for not reading the recipe. Now for what I thought of it. I didn't like it at all when I tasted it by itself. I think I prefer regular vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. But I thought it was ok when put on the BBQ sandwich. Somehow the BBQ sauce and chicken tempered the flavor of the red wine vinegar in the coleslaw. So not a total loss but I won't fix it again.",

This is a fantastic recipe for anybody watching calories fat and carbs; there's no oil or mayo. The only change I made was using Truvia instead of sugar. I've always used celery seed in cole slaw (either vinegar or mayo-based) but I've not used red wine vinegar before. It was much mellower (is that a word?) than cider vinegar and this was a success.",
