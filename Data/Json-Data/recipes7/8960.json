I used one package of dry onion soup mix, 4 oz of Chardonnay and one full can of cream of mushroom soup.  I cut the meat into pieces that wouldn't require a knife later, mixed all the ingredients with the meat and everything into a slow cooker and left for work. 10 hours later it was done and worked great with mashed or scalloped potatoes.  It was a little salty but we liked it that way. Definitely making again!",

Also I am not sure what MichelePM was looking at. I could not find any reference to yogurt. Lastly to the person who said it wasn't quite tender enough this is because you only cooked it 4 hours instead of the 8 the recipe called for. The longer you slow cook this the more tender it will become. GL Chef Cosmo",
