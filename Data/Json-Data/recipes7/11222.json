It is very very delicious and filling. I served it over baked potatoes topped with a little sharp cheddar and a side of cornbread muffins. The only thing I did differently was to decrease the cayenne by half because I was concerned too much heat would bother my toddlers. I really recommend trying this yummy recipe!!",
