The recipe says to start with 1 cup of eggnog and then add more if you need it. I added ad additional 1 Tbsp at a time and probably put in another 1/4 cup total to get the consistency I wanted. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I'd leave the cinnamon out next time. I probably won't make this again because it was just too rich with the eggnog and raspberry jelly but it's always fun to try new things!",
