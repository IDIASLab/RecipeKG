The cream cheese filling is what this cake is all about. Not too sweet but satisfying and perfect with a cup of coffee. I made half the recipe in a round deep dish pie pan and cooked for almost 40 minutes. I wish though I had taken it out 5 minutes sooner because my sides and bottom were just a smidge too done. The toothpick test for this cake is \"ify\" because the filling is wet and if you cook it till the toothpick comes out clean in my opinion that is just a little too long. Next time I will take it out when I feel the top set in the center, the filling should still set up fine because the heat of the cake will continue to cook it. The dough is very sticky and I found if I layed the dough in blobs and then pushed the blobs into place and into each other that worked best. Hubby gave it 5 stars too! I did add more nuts just because I like them.",

Only made a minor change: a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in the cream cheese layer. It is an extremely sticky dough, so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out. I think it's best room temperature. I found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container it gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day! Thanks so much! (I noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-I was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking...this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product.)",

I've had some epic failures but not with this coffee cake. The only sub was I used almonds instead of pecans. This cake baked up so fluffy and moist, which baffles me because of how sticky and flat it looked in the pan. And the stickiness would be my only complaint. It was hard to work the first layer of batter into the bottom of the pan. So, I knew there was no way I could spoon drop method top layer of batter. Luckily, I read that one of the other reviewer's hubby suggested using wax paper. I did and it worked, for the most part. Next time, I'll spray a little cooking spray on the paper first, so it can peel off easier. Definitely a keeper.",

I thought the calories were crazy high at 575 a serving. I used reduced fat cream cheese cut the recipe in half and baked it in my square 8x8 Fat Daddio pan. I greased the pan with PAM wiped out the excess and had absolutely no sticking. After it cooled I cut the cakes into 16 servings about 2x2 inch square easily with a plastic knife. Recalculated with the reduced recipe and serving cuts it came to 187 calories per serving. It was plenty enough and great with coffee. Due to having less batter I just did all of the cake mixture as 1 layer followed by the cream cheese mixture and then the topping which I did sub walnuts in as my only real change for the pecans.",
