I did have to cook it longer than stated to get a nice syrup consistancy but other than that it was great. I poured it over my baked chicken and my green beans and MY HUSBAND LOVED IT!!!

I searched \"asian sauce\" and this was one of many that came up and it sounded interesting. I doubled the recipe but cut back on the sugar about 1/3. It was incredibly easy and the ingredients were things that I always have on hand. My husband asked for a taste as the sauce was thickening and absolutely swooned! Honestly he went on and on about how amazing it was! I made the noodles and wings and when everything was cooked I tossed the noodles with the sauce and arranged each plate with a pile of sauced noodles two of the cooked pineapple slices (which cook up beautiful and tender BTW). Then I arranged 4 chicken wings around the pineapple (like a star) on each plate then spooned more sauce over the wings and served it with Green Giant green beans w/slivered almonds. It made a gorgeous presentation and my family could not get enough! I got high praises (for what was such a simple meal)! FYI also I had only used 6 pineapple slices when doubleing the recipe instead of 8 because I thought my family wouldn't really want to eat the pineapple. Wrong! Next time I'll make more than the recipe calls for because everyone wanted more of them! I will without a doubt make this sauce again. Next time I'm going to quadruple it so we have extra and/or for leftovers! Very highly recommend!",
