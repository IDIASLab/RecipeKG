It probably sat for about 1/2 hour to an hour and when we ate it was falling off the bone.  My guests raved about it the entire meal. This is not necessary of course but will make the dish even better.  I also noticed that one important part of the recipe was left out....you need to leave the skin on the chicken. I just realized it's not specified in the recipe.  That may be while some reviews say it is lacking flavor. Sorry.",

To get a really good flavor my husband and I normally add whole garlic cloves, by the time it has cooked an 1 1/2 hrs. the cloves are soft and so sweet they don't even taste like garlic anymore.  I alway add a lot of onions and season the chicken with garlic salt and pepper.  Parsley is a must.  The longer it can cook the better - if you are going to cook over the 1 1/2 hrs. you may want to add a little more water. Take the cover off the last 15 min. to brown the legs and crisp the onion slices a little. Enjoy we alway do.",

We used leg quarters instead of just the legs and used red potatoes instead of white.  Leaving the skin on the chicken and potatoes saves a lot of time.  I didn't use baby carrots since we didn't have them and just used regular carrots, cutting them lengthwise and in about 1 inch pieces.  We just used the potatoes, carrots and onions.   Everything came out very good and the broth from the chicken was delish...it is perfect to dip bread into.",

It makes its own juice.  I put a small pat of margarine on each piece of chicken.  I also sprinkle creole seasoning or some sort of rub on the entire dish.  This gives it a TON of flavor.  I put the broth from this dish into freezer bags and use it when a recipe calls for broth.  \n\nOne last thing, use any and all veggies on hand.  Some great additions to this are celery, tomatoes, and mushrooms.",

                "reviewBody": "I think the gist of this recipe is the method used to bake the chicken, which I've done for years.  Chicken and vegetables are \"steam\" baked using liquid, covering the pan with foil.  The proportions are too much to fit in a 9 x 13 pan, and 2 cups of liquid and butter suggested is way too much to use.  By the time the fat renders off the chicken the dish will be swimming.  I used 1/2 cup and it was just right.   It also lacked seasoning, so I gave it a good dose of herbs de Provence and a sprig of thyme to infuse some savory flavors.  Since I don't like soft skin, I increased the oven temp to 375, uncovered, and baked an additional 15 minutes to to crisp it up a bit.  For the basic cook, this recipe is okay.  Just be careful you either cut down on ingredients or use a larger pan.",
