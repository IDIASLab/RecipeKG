The fall weather always serves as inspiration for soup, especially butternut squash soups. I really wanted to put a spin on the typical squash soup this time, though. Optional garnishes include sliced scallions, toasted squash seeds, or shrimp. I highly suggest the toasted squash seeds as a garnish. They really add a lot!",

I realize the size of my squash may have been a factor but it was medium sized for the options I had. Would be wonderful as a sauce with rice veggies & chicken. I will add some broth before I eat it again. I liked the flavor though...nice to have a different take on butternut squash soup!",

In any event I made a half recipe as is my standard procedure for new recipes. This sounded like it would be good. I love red curry and had high hopes. Actually the recipe was quite good even though my husband did not like it. However a few cautions: I used one green pepper because I did not have any red peppers. The overwhelming flavor of the soup was green pepper. I would definitely cut back. I used half a can of coconut milk and ended up adding the rest because the soup was so thick it could almost not be stirred. All said and done this tasted like red curry sauce overwhelmed with green pepper with a hint of squash. IF I make it again I will definitely cut down on the pepper and have extra coconut milk on hand!",
