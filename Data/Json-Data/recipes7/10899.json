It was the perfect amount with a couple of tablespoons left over to top 2 yr old Grand Daughters vanilla ice cream. Grand Daughter loved it. Mom and dad thought the pie was awesome and I can apparently make another one sooner than latter. I enjoyed it on toast and aged cheddar cheese. I would definitely make this again and pass the recipe along. Thanks so much as Saskatoon recipes are hard to come by just like the berries.",
