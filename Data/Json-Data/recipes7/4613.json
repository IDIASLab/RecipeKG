I also left out the chocolate chips because I am not a fan of crunchy things in my brownies I never put walnuts in them either. Also as it wasn't passover I put 1 cup regular flour. They made the house smell really nice and tasted really good. I did make a double recipe and cooked it in one large pan and they came out all right but needed to cook for an hour instead of 45 minutes",
