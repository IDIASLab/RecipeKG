I used butter instead of shortening because that was what I had. It came out softer than I expected - more like fruit leather consistency I was expecting something closer to a brittle. Maybe that's because of the butter? Either way I'm sure they will work fine in the recipe I will be making. Next time I may try bringing the ingredients to a boil on the stovetop and see if that results in a firmer texture.",

None of the grocery stores in the neighborhood had them in stock, and the King Arthur Baking online store sold them for $15 a bag plus shipping.\n\nI had never tried or heard of Cinnamon bits (chips) before seeing them as a listed ingredient in a Thanksgiving muffin recipe I want to make. Now that I know they exist and how to make them, my head is buzzing with the possibilities these flavor bombs enable.  \n\nThese were not difficult by any means, but it\u2019s not exactly familiar or intuitive either, so here are some notes from my experience.\n\nI don\u2019t use shortening very often and unfortunately discovered mine to be slightly rancid smelling when I went to make these. It was too late to go to the store and I needed to get these made so I substituted ghee, which I always keep in the fridge. This seems to have worked out fine, and who knows, maybe it will impart an extra buttery flavor in my muffins.\n\nI rolled over the mix with a rolling pin to maybe 1/8 inch because that seemed like a good end-result size to me. I used my fingers to smooth the edges and make a rectangle so every chip could have a nice edge.\n\nI had to fiddle with the oven temp and timing at the end to get it to go from oily to bubbly at the end (watching it closely)\n\nThese start out dark cinnamon color and remain a dark cinnamon color. Nothing \u201cgolden\u201d happens \u2013 the trick seems to be to get these just to the bubbly state and don\u2019t burn them\n\nI used Tung Hing cinnamon from Penze",
