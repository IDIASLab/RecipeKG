This in turn lead to playing with different ingredients and alas, the Zesty Celery Sour was born! Don't be fooled by the celery - it might sound weird, but it surprises everyone that tries it! I developed the recipe using pickled jalapenos, however I have since made it with fresh and it's equally as tasty. This will make enough simple syrup for several drinks.",

The first was on the rocks and then for the second I went with sparkling version and used club soda. Both were equally good so it really just depends on what you are in the mood for. My husband and I both loved the flavor combo and this is one I will make often this summer. Thanks for sharing!",
