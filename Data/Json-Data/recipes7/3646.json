I'd never had anything like that before. The cheesecake is definitely a semi-sweet flavor. For those who would prefer more of a milk chocolate flavor try using fewer bakers chocolate squares or melt a milk chocolate to mix in the cheesecake. I thought that many would be too much but it tastes great to me and wasn't at all grainy.",

Once I poured my caramel mixture over the base I sprinkled the top caramel layer with 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I prepared everything else as directed and baked with a casserole dish on the bottom rack filled with water to prevent the top of my cheesecake from cracking. Once baked and cooled and the rim had been removed I drizzled on some store bought caramel sauce and hot fudge sauce in a decorative fashion the sprinkled on another 1/2 cup of crushed pecans. It was a HUGE HUGE hit!",
