I have a very small kitchen, and I do not have all of the kitchen implements that are normally found in everyday kitchens.  I used a wooden cutting board to divide the dough.  As mentioned previously, I dipped the dough chunks into melted butter followed by a bowl of sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon.\n\nI used peaches in heavy syrup, and I drained one of the cans thoroughly, thinking that there would be too much liquid otherwise.  This turned out to be a wise move, since there was plenty of liquid, even after adding a bit more corn starch to the mixture.",
