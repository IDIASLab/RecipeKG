It is very sweet but I serve it (because it had been served 1 time in Chile this way) with fresh rasberries. I find that the tartness of the rasberries really balances out the sweetness. It tasted just like the one I had there made at a friends house. Thank you so much I had been unable to find the recipe in English!!",
