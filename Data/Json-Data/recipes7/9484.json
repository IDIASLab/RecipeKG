I made some changes based on preference (way less sugar- 1/2 cup turbinado is the only sweetener I used, whole wheat flour in place of the white, extra baking powder in place of the baking soda).  Then I made some changes based on what I had on hand (grapeseed oil in place of canola, almond milk in place of the coconut milk, and ginger in place of the nutmeg.\nThey turned out just lovely and my family was very pleased.

I also substituted 1/2 the amount of oil for applesauce (so 1/2 cup oil; 1/2 cup applesauce (which also adds an element of sweetness)). I will do the same method next time or possibly use coconut oil instead of canola oil as I see another user has done. Yum!",
