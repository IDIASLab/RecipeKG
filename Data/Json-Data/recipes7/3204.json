I added 1 cup of pecans 1 tsp. cinnamon used only 1 tsp. vanilla and substituted 1 cup of Splenda for one of the cups of sugar. I baked the cake in an angel food pan for 1 hr. and 15 min. It came out very moist almost gooey at the bottom but I'm sure cooking it longer would have had no effect on the gooeyness. I'll make it again. I do wish I could find a recipe that would produce a more cake like effect. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewBody": "this persimmon cake recipe cooks very well in an 8x8 baking dish for 50 minutes at 300 degrees. In contrast the instructions for this recipe as of November 2011 call for 1 hour & 15 minutes cook time in a \"9x13 loaf pan\". This could lead to disaster! Now that the FYIs out of the way I must say this cake is very good. Like others I made modifications. I used self rising flour. I used 1.5 cup white sugar and 1/4 golden brown sugar instead of the 2 cups white sugar. I pared down the vanilla from 2 tsp to 1.5 tsp. I added 1 tsp pumpkin spice and 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon. The recipe refers to a cream cheese icing but without a corresponding recipe. IMHO the cake didn't need it. It has a super moist but mild flavor that could have been overpowered with icing. I preferred the cake with some melted butter and a dash of confectioner's sugar served warm. Alternately it works well when served with a dollop of whipped cream. I chose not to remove it from the pan because I didn't frost it. The sides of the cake in the dish were especially yummy because they took on a chewy moist texture. Had I put 2 cups white sugar I think it would have been over-sweet because my persimmons were extremely ripe. Had I put in a larger quantity of vanilla extract but no spices I think it would have been good but not \"as good\". The way I made it suited the tastes of the four people who enjoyed it. I would give it a \"5\". The way the instructions read I would rate it a \"3\".",
