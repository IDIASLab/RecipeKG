I found the majority of the salt went down the drain with the excess water, I notices one user was afraid of all the salt use, however the salt draws the excess liquid out. I too like another user, used less sugar. The calculation for 130 servings made exactly 7 and 1/2 pints and calls for 4 and 3/4 cups of sugar, so I reduced it to 3 cups. The relish is so amazing!!! Zesty, delicious and the majority of it came from our own garden. Thank you Suzy!!! Its a keeper for future green tomatoes that don't turn by mid-fall.",

Most recipes this size call for 4 or 5 tablespoons of salt not a cup. One tablespoon of relish following the recipe would contain as much salt as a human needs in a day. Also this is an awful lot of vinegar. The quantity and mix of vegies is perfect but it needs to be modified to be edible.",
