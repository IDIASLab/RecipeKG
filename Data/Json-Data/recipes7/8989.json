Also because the recipe makes so many I froze a dozen of them to enjoy another day! I love butternut squash any way you can make it so this really hit the spot for me and this was the first time my six-year old actually enjoyed his squash. He said \"Good job Mommy! You served me squash and I liked it!\" My only change was to substitute real brown sugar for the brown sugar replacement in which case you need to double to amount of brown sugar to 1.5 cups. Happy baking! Thanks a lot for a great recipe!",
