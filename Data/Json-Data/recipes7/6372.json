I baked it in a 9\" round pan sprayed with cooking spray and it just slipped right out with no problem. I like the additional sweetness and it doesn't include eggs. I used the dry buttermilk and it worked great here. My oven runs warm so I checked it at 40 min and it was already done (probably would have to toss it I went by the time specified). The butter compliments the bread nicely. I ended up using the full amount of whiskey in it; every time I added a tsp I didn't notice much difference. Happy St Patrick's Day!",
