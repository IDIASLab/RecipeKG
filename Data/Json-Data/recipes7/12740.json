Instead of using lemon extract i used the juice from 1/2 lemon (6 teaspoons), and the zest from the entire lemon. I added the juice to the milk, to make butter milk, while i got out my ingredients. Also I didn't bother sprinkling sugar over the strawberries, but did decide to toss them with a teaspoon of flour(to prevent them from sinking)I used a darker pan, so cooked mine at 350 , and they were perfect at the 20 minute mark! Next time i will substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil.",
