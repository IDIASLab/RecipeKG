With the reduction of lemon juice, these can not be called lemon cupcakes, there will be very very little if any lemon flavoring. I spent weeks tweaking this recipe and made many less-than-mediocre cupcakes until I came up with the one I originally submitted. I've tried this cupcake with store bought gluten free blend and they were awful! The GF blend recipe you want to use is also in my recipe box. I can almost guarantee that this particular published recipe will not turn out good with many of the store bought GF flour mixes.",

I originally made a batch of these exactly as written, using the flour mix by the submitter, but the texture was off as well as there seemed to be too much baking powder. The second batch was much better. I only used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of the original flour mix + 1/8 cup of sorghum flour to give it a bit of density. This proved to be the right mixture rendering a cupcake to sink your teeth into. I used a lemon-lime glaze on top. Thank you for the recipe.",
