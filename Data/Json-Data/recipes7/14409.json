That being said, I diagonally cut my carrots into chunks and with the small amount of liquid called for in this recipe, I had concerns about whether or not the carrots would cook before the vegetable stock cooked out.  So I did give them a bit of a head start by steaming them in the microwave for a couple minutes.  I did not have fresh sage (that\u2019s  one herb I don\u2019t grow), so I used dried and stirred it into the carrots along with the salt and a fresh grind of pepper,  rather than using those three ingredients as a garnish.  Very flavorful and savory side dish to pork roast, mashed potatoes and gravy.",
