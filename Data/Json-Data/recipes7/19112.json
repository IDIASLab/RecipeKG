I followed the recipe exactly (only substitution was using vanilla extract instead of paste) and the cakes turned out very tasty & moist.  The only issue I had was even after doubling the recipe, it was a struggle to fill all 24 liners - I scraped every last drop but a few cupcakes were still kind of small.  The lemon cream cheese frosting was quite delicious, but it seemed to overpower the nutmeg in the cake as I wasn't able to taste it.  If I do these again, I think I will add more nutmeg for more of the flavor to shine through.   Also, after doubling the frosting, I had enough to do at least another dozen cupcakes.  So overall, not enough batter, but way too much frosting - I guess it would be good for those that like very heavily frosted cupcakes, but I try to be more balanced with the cake to frosting ratio.",
