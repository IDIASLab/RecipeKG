                "reviewBody": "Just finished eating this - made it for my first time with some modifications, thanks to the other reviewers for the heads-up on the flavor.  Here's what I did:\n\nI sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in a pat of butter, then threw in some premade carmelized onions.  I chopped up some orange bell pepper and added that.  I had less than 3/4 cup quinoa on hand, so I added that dry to the sautee, after a few min put the ingredients to the side in a bowl.  I browned about 2 Tbs. of pine nuts in a frying pan, then set to the side.  I brought 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth to a boil.  Meanwhile, I chopped up less than half of the butternut squash along with less than one of the zucchini's (due to my quinoa shortage, I cut the ingredients by more than half) and fried them on low in a bit of butter and oil.  That took about 15 min or so to cook.  I added the quinoa sautee to the broth, then the cranberries and let it simmer for a while.  I feel like the cooking time from that point was another 1/2 an hour. After maybe 20 min of cooking and adding dashes of pepper and cumin, I added the squash and zucchini.  I noticed that the quinoa was still very wet towards the end, so I sprinkled in couscous very carefully, mixed well, covered, and eventually turned off the heat and put a paper towel over the pot, under the lid to absorb additional moisture. Finally, added green onions, pine nuts and chopped cilantro instead of parsley. Ate with a squirt of lime and topped with chopped avocado.",
