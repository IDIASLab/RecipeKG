I had to make a couple of changes - I had no white sugar so I had to substitute Splenda. Good to know I can make this for my father in law who is diabetic. Also I only used 1/2 the splenda on the blueberries as a whole cup seemed too much and I was right on - it was a lovely combination of sweet/tart. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. The grunt was so delicious served with homemade vanilla ice cream out on our front porch looking at the tide going out. Perfection.",

I had no idea what a grunt is, but it seemed like a fun idea to tell my husband that he was having \"grunt\" for dessert after I found this when looking for something to do with some blueberries I had bought.  This was very quick and easy to make and tasted so good.  Only thing I did different was to reduce the amount of sugar to about 2/3 cup after I tasted my blueberries to see how sweet they were.
