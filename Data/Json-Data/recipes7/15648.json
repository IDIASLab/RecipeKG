I also used a full bottle of French Grenache (less the glass I drank while cooking) and added 1/4 cup of Cognac for richer flavor. I added frozen carrots at the end. Only part that was time consuming was the pearl onion prep. My local grocery stores do not carry frozen any more. This was truely delicious and I will definitely make it again.",
