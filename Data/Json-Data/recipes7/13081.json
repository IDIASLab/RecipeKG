The main addition/substitution I would suggest, and we made, was instead of using butter and sugar to cement the apple slices into place, use blackberry jam.

I used jam instead of butter and I sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar. I also used the smaller and thinner apple slices to roll in the middle (cause those ones are being bent the most) then gradually placed the bigger slices outside. Then dusted with powdered surgar mixed with a bit of cinnamon ^^",

A word of caution: I have made them in a muffin tin and to make sure they fit, I might have rolled the roses a bit to tight, because when they were done, the inside was a bit underdone to my taste. Next time I will try ramekins and will make sure to make the rolls a bit more lose so the hit can cook them more evenly. I would also try to make them sweeter  next time, may be will use jam as other reviewer recommended. Thank you,  Chief John for yet another great recipe. I will definitely make them again and again!",

My recipe actually came from someone else...who used no eggs. Added lemon to the apples so they don't turn color and used apricot jam on top of the dough then sprinkled with cinnamon and lay the apples on top. They are rolled the same and everything else is done the same. My only problem is that I scrimped on the jam but I will use my own recipe...Its nice to see that others make it too. I used Maple Leaf Puff Pastry on my first batch but will use PC All-Butter Puff Pastry with the second...and see if it comes out less heavy.",

Would say they are just as (or more) tasty than apple pie yet more beautiful and easier to make. Even bigger bonus - they're easy to make just the right amount when you're preparing for only two or three people. Will definitely make them again and keep them in mind for guests and parties. They were a little difficult to eat with just a dessert fork - perhaps because the apples are a little more firm than in pie which makes them more flavorful but not as easy to cut through. Changes: o Maybe our apples were too large or sliced too thin; used an average of 1/2 apple per rosette. o Tried different levels of layering the apples and different size ramekins. When baked even heavy layering looked good. For ramekin size however if you want to easily remove an attractive rosette after baking be sure it's tall enough to hold all of the rosette. o They were starting to look pretty dark by 30 minutes of baking so turned the oven down 10 degrees for the last ten minutes. Perfect! o Took the advice of the video and went lighter on the sugar with most of this test batch. We liked those with lighter sugar better. Thanks for a wonderfully easy and impressive recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I made two sets of these for the first time on 9/26/16. In both cases I used non-stick baking pans - one was a muffin pan; the other one had a ruffled shape to it. I cooked one pan at a time for the alloted 45 minutes at 375 degrees and all of the bottoms and part of the sides got extra dark (just short of burning). I had to actually scrape a few off before putting them on a presentation plate. I was disappointed that apples done this way hardly retain any of their bright vibrant red skin color...they basically all just turn very dark. On the second set I had the good sense to put a tent of foil loosely over the top of the pan to help prevent over-browning but this did nothing to help the BOTTOMS of the pastries which still pretty much got burned a bit. I definitely don't suggest putting any sugar on the top before baking them. Any suggestions on how to keep the bottom of the pastries from burning or over-caramelizing would be appreciated! Perhaps putting a cookie sheet under my muffin pan? I don't know. Help. LOL M.",
