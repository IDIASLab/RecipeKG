I combined all the spices to make my donair spice blend. for the meat portion I used a box of steak-umms! take your time cooking these. slice in three; pan fry don't flip or stir as the strips will fall apart and turn into cheesestake meat. While cooking the meat add the spice. This recipe is for 5lbs of meat. using the spice blend I used 4.5 tsps for the one pound box of steak umms. AMAZING! Just like home Listuguj QC The sauce is good however next time I would use about 1/2 tsp less of garlic powder. Thanks for sharing!",
