I had a bunch of fresh peaches we brought home from Kentucky that I wanted to top the cake with. It was wonderfully dense and moist at the same time. It baked with a nice crust and sliced like a dream. A great recipe that I will be using again.",

It sagged a bit when I touched with finger for done-ness so grabbed a toothpick which came out clean so I pulled it out then. Nice and buttery ( I used only butter) and in place of milk I used half 'n half. No problem getting out of pan. I added a bit of almond extract - about 1/2 tsp or so; left out lemon. Conclusion - either I'm getting a lot quicker at making pound cakes or this one was just plain easy/ straightforward. It was used as a base for \"Raspberry Trifle\" from this site.",
