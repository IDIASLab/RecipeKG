If you add just a small amount of extra flour, the dough holds together enough to shape without having to wait for it to chill.  It does not affect the taste or texture at all.  Also, I didn't use baking sheets.  I rolled them into balls, dipped in sugar, and put in mini muffin tins with cupcake liners.  Then, you don't have to worry about cracking or spreading.  I baked in a pre-heated oven for 6 minutes, removed, added the kisses, and baked for an additional 3 minutes.  No need to rotate the pans.  There is just no need to keep opening the oven. Keep it closed and let them bake.   I shaved three minutes off the time as written.  Perfection and much easier than the way it's written!",

                "reviewBody": "Caliboo - I like your tip on using mini muffin tins :)  In my oven, i need to rotate pans since i bake 4 dozen cookies on 2 large cookie sheets per bake cycle. Each baker knows their oven (or should!) and will decide whether rotating is needed or not, but I get a more consistent color/even bake when rotating. Adding flour will affect the texture and flavor. Flour stiffens the dough, which may help hold the form of the cookie/prevent spread, but makes it more dry and crumbly when baked. Chilling instead will preserve shape without impairing flavor or texture. \n\nThe the couple folks with negative reviews stating they were dry/crumbly, all i can say is you did it wrong somehow. You skipped an ingredient or changed the batch yield perhaps, but as i previously commented, i forgot the milk once and knew immediately it was a MAJOR problem. the dough was crumbly before baking without milk, but even adding it after dough was mixed still saved the batch. \n\nRegarding batch yield. Allrecipes changed my title from which had said DOUBLE BATCH. They left my ingredient list as written, but the yield shown on the published version is 4 doz, which is incorrect. This recipe yeilds about 8-10 doz, depending how small you roll the balls. (I aim for no bigger than 1.25\" diameter cookies when baked, or about 2+ tsp of dough)",

                "reviewBody": "I agree with the original poster. You must chill the dough. Simply adding more flour alters the overall taste. I've tried making them both ways, and the chilled dough is by far the best.  Please follow the directions and use shortening. I used Crisco Butter Flavored Shortening and the cookies were fantastic. I've used butter in the past when I didn't have shortening on hand, and the cookies aren't as fluffy. Also, for those who say you don't need to bake the Hershey Kiss - you're missing out on what makes this cookie great!  If you don't bake the Kiss, it's a hard piece of chocolate in a soft cookie. Baking the Kiss changes the density. It sits back up, but loses the harsh firmness and melts in your mouth. Yes, if you let the cookies cool you can stack the baked Kisses. :)\n\nThank you for sharing your recipe.",

I've had others that are more along the lines of a traditional peanut butter cookie on the bottom, crunchier texture, flat, greasy tasting... Not this one.  I prefer when the cookie holds it's  shape and comes out thicker and soft, and this recipe fit the bill. Made them yesterday with my 4 year old son and we had a blast doing it together.  Ate one his morning and they are yummy!  The baking times were spot on for me.  The only issue I had was that my kisses seem to want to pop off the cookie... But really, who cares?!",

I think they need more shortening, butter, milk -- something!  Also, mine were not very sweet -- I think the recipe translated incorrectly when I increased from 4 dozen to 6 dozen.  Be careful when using that tool here on this site.  Time-consuming cookies to make; expensive (nearly $10 for Hershey's Kisses) and ultimately quite disappointing. Look elsewhere to make delicious Peanut Butter Blossoms.",
