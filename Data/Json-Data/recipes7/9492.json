Since the broth consisted of beef drippings and apple cider this seemed the perfect recipe to utilize the broth. I halved the recipe which meant I needed 5.75 C of liquid. I felt like the leftover broth had a strong enough apple flavor so I added 1.75 C of beef stock instead of chicken stock or apple cider. I didn't add the cinnamon or cloves since the leftover broth already had both in it. I also forgot to put the garnish on when I served it. This was really different. 7 people tried it: 4 really liked it 2 thought it was okay and 1 didn't care for it. I'm giving it 4 stars since most liked it (including me!).",
