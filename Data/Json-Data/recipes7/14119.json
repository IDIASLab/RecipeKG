So I added the 2 tablespoons to the streusel mixture instead. This helped the streusel retain its crumbled texture without melting entirely into the cake. I used the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour in the cake mixture, and it didn't adversely affect the crumb of the cake at all. It was deliciously moist!",

We are huge nut, cinnamon and brown sugar lovers!!!\n\nI tweaked the recipe only a bit: \n1) I doubled the amount of nuts (used walnuts instead of pecans) and chopped them with a knife, not too fine; \n2) I used only brown sugar for the crumb and doubled the cinnamon (we love cinnamon); \n3) I used organic sugar instead of white for the batter and put 3 eggs instead of 2, which made it easier to spread in the pan before baking. \n\nI have now made this cake 4 times (in 1 month) due to requests and that is the ultimate recipe for my family. Both husband's and my families absolutely love it!!! Thank you so much!\n\nUPDATE July 2019 - I cannot express how loved this cake is. My husband took a bunch to work and it was gone within 3 minutes, with people asking for recipes or begging him to have me make it again. I have been making it at least once a month. Over time, I have mastered it. The change is to put a whole large container of sour cream- about 500ml. It makes the cake even more fluffy! I have now made it so many times that I eyeball all the ingredients and measure nothing! It turns out great every time!",

To get that great layer of yummy goodness in the middle make sure to chop the pecans first, then measure out the 1 1/2 cups. I've made this twice this week. The first time I doubled the recipe, and used a total of 3 cups of whole pecans that I coarsely chopped.  It filled two 8x8x2 pans and a 6 large muffin tin.  My husband and I loved it, but thought it needed more filling, and  I realized after looking at  Chef John's photo, my filling seemed lost (didn't chop the pecans up enough) but everyone still LOVED it and asked for the recipe). The second time I made a triple batch, decided to chop the pecans with my food processor, then measured them out (4 1/2 cups total). PERFECTION!  This time I filled both a  9x13x2, and an 8x8x2 pan with a beautiful layer in the middle and topping. I ate one piece right out of the oven, and of course it wasn't set yet, buy YUMMY!  Served it at a party the next day, everyone loved it!  I camp monthly as an assistant scout master with a boy scout troop. I'll for sure be making this on a future campout in a Dutch oven over charcoals, for the \"old goat (adult leaders) patrol\". pretty sure this will be one the scouts will want to learn to make after they try it.
