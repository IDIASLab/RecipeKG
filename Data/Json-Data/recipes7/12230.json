The dough was too gooey to be rolled out like traditional sugar cookies so I rolled the dough into balls and pressed them with a cup so they looked like discs. Not a super sweet cookie so definitely benefitted from frosting! But they are fluffy and soft and very tasty. Will make again!",

I ran out of white flour but had some whole wheat flour. so I did half white and half whole wheat. I refrigerated the cookies for 2 hours and they rolled out perfectly. I did work fast bc the dough does warm up and gets soft. The cookies aren't overly sweet which is great for a cookie that should have frosting on it! I made home made cream cheese frosting. Overall I was really happy with this recipe.",
