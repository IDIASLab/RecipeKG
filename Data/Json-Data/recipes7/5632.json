I also used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour instead of millet and rice flour. I love that the cornbread came out nice and fluffly but still holds its shape. Gluten free breads and cornbread tend to fall apart but not this one. I plan on making again and adding applesauce and cinnamon for more of a breakfast type bread. Thanks! Great recipe!",

I made this thinner than the recipe by putting it into a 9x13 pan and it was done in 20 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!",

It turns out that I didn't need to, but regardless, this is now my go-to cornbread recipe!  I love this cornbread!!!  The only thing I didn't like was that it often turned out a little too dry and crumbly, but I finally figured out how to fix that thanks to another reviewer - add xanthan gum.  I had never used it before and was a little hesitant to add too much. I used 2 1/2 t. baking powder and about 3/4 t. of xanthan gum (which I stirred into the dry ingredients) and voila!  Problem solved!  It was fluffy but moist and stayed together.  Perfect!!  Thank you for the recipe and the great suggestions!",
