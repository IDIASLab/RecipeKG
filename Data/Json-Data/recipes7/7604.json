It really makes something quite healthy into not so healthy with all that sugar.  No need for any sugar, the blueberries cranberries and carrots add enough sweetness!

I accidentally used up my last red onion before I made this so I omitted it but it is still fantastic! I made it before be the other night and brought it out in the morning just to taste in and ended up having a big bowl of it for breakfast! Just had another big bowl today...YUM. the textures and flavors are awesome. I put 1/2 the dressing on the salad and reserved the rest but it doesn't need the rest. its really great as is. WILL make again and definitely sharing this recipe!",

DH and DS are still working on the bitterness of the leaves, but not ready to give up on it.   I made this for a birthday carry-in at work, and it was well received.  I did cut the sugar back to \u00bc cup and it worked well.  It is a very pretty salad with all the colors going on.  Making the salad 4 \u2013 6 hours ahead of time is a must.  The kale needs time to soften up.  The next time I make it, I will make it the night before and add the cashew pieces and sunflower seeds right before serving.  This is very good, pretty and by cutting the sugar back pretty healthy for you.  Thank you, Susan, for sharing your recipe.",
