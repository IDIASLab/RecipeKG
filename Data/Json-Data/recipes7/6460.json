I like a little kick so I added just a touch of adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers. Not only is this a refreshing cool side dish but I brought it to a cocktail party where we ate it on crackers and it was a real hit. Nice addition to the summer recipe rotation - Thanks!",

I had it with crackers but tortilla chips would be good too for dipping into it. It's perfect as is I'd like to try adding other flavor enhancers next time such as Adobo cumin or smoked paprika. Good for a New Year's Day bean dish as the author suggested. Delicious and healthy too!",

After everything had marinated for a few hours it didn't taste as sweet as I thought it would so next time I'll put in all the sugar.",
