This may be why some are reporting longer cook times. \nI only use 1cup of sugar, and for me the end result is sweet enough. I also like to add a small splash of vanilla and a tablespoon of butter to enhance the flavor and creaminess. \nLast, depending on the texture you want, mashing, blending, or food processing the cooked beans  is necessary. Otherwise all you get is lumpy sweetened beans.  Do this once the beans are fully cooked. If your blended mixture is too runny, just cook it down a bit longer. I like to set aside about a \u00bc cup of the whole cooked beans and stir them in at the very end to add a little texture.  Texture is up to your individual preference, however.. \nThese are some tips that work well for me.",

Definitely took more than two hours to get the beans to soften, and that was w/ med-high heat. I do not suggest lowering the sugar/honey content than what the recipe suggested because the high level of sweetness is a large part of what removes the after-flavor of bean.  Ultimately I was satisfied with this recipe, though, as mentioned, took longer than anticipated and the beans were a bit difficult to crush (though they were fully soft). Next time, I think I will half the recipe. :)",
