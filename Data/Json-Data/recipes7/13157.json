I had plenty of sugar mixture left over so that can easily be reduced. This was surprisingly tasty the smell of the bananas browning in the butter was just heavenly. DO make sure you use very firm bananas as they will soften and sweeten.. I can see this being a disaster if you use a ripe bananas (they will turn to mush). Mine cooked up in 10 minutes (5 on each side). I served mine as a trio on a plate to make it look more appealing. Placed some on top of melted dark chocolate and served alongside some fresh whipped cream. This would be fantastic like suggested on vanilla ice cream and you could even use the leftover butter in the pan to make a quick caramel. Would love to try this as a topping to some pancakes for a special breakfast.",
