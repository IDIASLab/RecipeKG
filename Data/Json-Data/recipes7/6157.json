The colorful veggies really make a very nice presentation and the apples give you a little pop of sweetness.

Add to that the fact Mr. LTH said he \"liked the slaw\" and he HATES vinegar and it'll definately get repeat action at the LTH house. I did double the vinegar but leave the sugar the same as I wasn't sure 2T would coat. I messed up and bought broccoli slaw mix instead of the bagged cabbage and it worked out well. I think next time I'll sub a Granny Smith for the Golden Delicious. THANKS for such a good for us recipe sandra!",
