Also, as the submitter suggested, I cut the flour in half as well. I usually make a big batch so I don't have to start from scratch every time and this one lends itself well for that. I used a cup of water mixed into the beef and seasoning mix and it turned out just right. Not too runny and not too thick. Will definately make this my usual mix! Thank you for submitting it!",

I did have some changes, but the basic recipe was followed.\n1 tbsp flour\n1 tsp chili powder\n1 1/2 tsp dried minced onion\n(no paprika, not on my shelf)  :(\n1 beef bouillon cube\n1/4 tsp sugar\n1/4 tsp cayenne\n1/2 tsp jarred minced garlic (no powder on my shelf)\n(no onion powder, again didn't have any)\n***ordinarily I may have ensured I had those items but I also thought I had taco seasoning on hand.
