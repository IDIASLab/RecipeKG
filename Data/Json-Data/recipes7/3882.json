Rolled the circles between two sheet or wax paper and used GF preserves as the filling.  SO YUMMY!!!",

I also used store-bought jam, with no other issues. Yum!",

Amazing flavor & I love cooking w my oils (I sell them as well). The dough rolled out so nicely. Didn't have time to make the filling so I used a combo of cherry & apricot Bon Maman preserves. I made the cookies thin so I baked them only 14-16 min per batch. Crunchy edges & soft inside. Wonderful!",
