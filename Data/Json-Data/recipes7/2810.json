The combination of dried cranberries almonds and chocolate is wonderful! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I found I needed to tweak it. The dough was too dry & crumbly so I added a splash of milk so I could manage the dough. Also I couldn't taste the coffee so I would increase that. I do think the chocolate brings out the coffee flavor a bit. This is a real keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "Made this again recently this is still one of my favorite biscotti recipes. Instead of \"stirring\" in the toppings (chocolate almonds etc) I put the dough on a cutting board/clean surface and knead the toppings in slowly to help control where everything is going. 12/24/2012 Perfection! I always get rave reviews when I make these biscotti. They are very easy to make and the dough isn't as sticky as some other biscotti recipes I've tried -- makes it easier to knead the dough. The only tweaks I make is to double up on the espresso skip the dried apricots and add a 1/4 cup more of each of the chocolate almonds and cranberries (personal preference). When forming the logs I like to angle the top and bottom edges of the dough so that when you cut them diagonally you don't waste too much of the cookie. After it is twice baked and cooled I like to dip some of the cookies in ganache chocolate (See Chocolate Ganache Recipe).",

The orange zest flavor is pretty dominant and I liked that. The colors arent so vibrant like on the marichino cherry ones. I actually labeled what was in them on the gift packages because its hard to tell. Only change I made was halving the fruit and chopping it up. I also just chopped whole almonds. For the coffee I used starbucks instant Christmas blend grind. Lastly I used cake flour and salted butter. The 2\" width on the shaping seemed small. I went with approximately 2.5.\" I suggest that because they dont puff up much larger after the first bake. They still are a smaller biscotti. I had no issues with cutting them which was nice. I hope the food gift is liked.",

Espresso flavor is good. Orange undetectable. Product is extremely dry and very crumbly when cut. Would strongly advise just following your own favorite biscotti recipe adding expresso flavoring.",
