                "reviewBody": "2-17-2017 My mission was to find a cucumber salad that was something different from the same old cucumbers with sour cream or tomato-cucumber salad. What a happy delicious find this was! I made a few minor tweaks but nothing that really changed the recipe. For instance because of Hubs sensitive innards I had to take the heat level down to coward level by eliminating the chili oil altogether (and replacing it with an equal measure of vegetable oil) and using just a wee pinch of the crushed red pepper flakes. Hubs said he didn t even notice the red pepper flakes were in there so I guess I ll kick it up a notch next time! Other than that I stuck with the recipe exactly as directed and would only change one thing. It was a little salty for us. Next time I ll either reduce the salt by maybe half or rinse the salted cucumbers contrary to the recipe s instructions. For the sugar I used a sugar substitute which if nothing else simply made me feel good. I think some toasted sesame seeds or black sesame seeds would have been a worthy addition tho this was pretty much flawless as is. As with some other 5-star recipes I ve tried the biggest error I made was in not making more than I did. We scarfed up every last bit.",

I did find that if I were to follow the recipe it would be too salty for me so I basically only put in half of the called for salt. I also found that it is not a good idea to soak the cucumbers in the dressing over night as they get very soggy and the whole thing gets very watery. I don't sprinkle salt on the cucumbers either as I found that makes them give off water even more causing them to become soggy. When I make it with cucumbers I basically dip the cucumbers in the dressing or I pour the dressing over them right before I eat them.",
