I cut the white sugar back using 1/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, added 1/4 cup of honey, used applesauce in place of oil and used Greek yogurt in place of milk.  Lastly, I did squeeze the shredded zucchini between paper towels to get rid of the water so that the muffins would not be too wet.",

Moist and juicy; an excellent way to use the last half zucchini I had left over from another recipe, plus the last of the blueberries from this year's tiny crop. I didn't measure the zucchini, but I figured it was a little over a cup, but it worked out fine. Only thing I did differently was use 1/2c. whole wheat flour instead of all white, but that's one of my standard baking secrets. Made a dozen big, gorgeous, plump muffins just right for breakfast or anytime. Couldn't eat just one, no way, and I don't plan to share these beauties with anyone!",

Very moist and delicious  and an excellent way to use up what I had on hand. I used applesauce to replace the oil and plain yogurt to replace the milk (for my toddler).  Thanks for submitting. UPDATE:  I would like to add that since I replaced the oil with applesauce & used frozen blueberries, this did not keep long at all.  It turned into a slimy consistency within 3 days.  If you aren't going to eat all of the muffins in 2 days,  1/2 the recipe or go with the original ingredients (oil) it will keep longer.",

                "reviewBody": "7-31-2017  ~While looking for a recipe for muffins calling for zucchini, this one had me at olive oil. The olive oil, along with the zucchini of course, made these incredibly moist.  The zucchini is undetectable and the amount of cinnamon makes these delicately and pleasantly spiced.  A happy mistake was that I inadvertently reversed the amounts of brown sugar and granulated sugar which I believe contributed a little extra flavor.  I did not add the pecans, choosing to add an extra handful of blueberries instead.  A happy surprise was accidently finding some extra streusel I had stashed in the freezer, perfectly suited for these muffins, an addition that took them over the top.  The bottom line?  Hubs remarked, \u201cThese are the best  \"D\" things (muffins) I ever ate.  Ten stars!\u201d",

I used 1\\2 cup of honey for the sweetener, added 1\\2 tsp. nutmeg as others suggested. I also used 1\\2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. For the milk I had buttermilk so I used that, I am thinking other milk would work just fine. No nuts because of a nut allergy and I added dried cranberries instead of the blueberries.

Yikes!  \nI read a few of the reviews and decided I would try this recipe as close to the original recipe as possible.  The only substitution I made was the oil. I just couldn't put olive oil in my blueberry muffins!  Instead I used a 1/2 cup of homemade apple butter which turned out amazing!  The apple butter added a deep and flavorful complexity to the blueberry/zucchini mix! Plus the moisture and texture were perfect.  The AB did make the muffins a little darker in color FYI.  \nThe only other thing I did purposely for this recipe was to squeeze out my previously shredded and frozen zucchini.  When it thaws from the freezer, it's extra watery, so I stuck it in the colander and squeezed much of the extra liquid out.  I freeze my shredded zucchini in bags of 2cup amounts.  When I was done squeezing the 2cups, I actually ended up with a total of 1cup in the end.  It was the perfect amount and texture for the recipe apparently.  The muffins were amazing!  \nOh, one more thing, I didnt add nuts.  My family doesn't like them.\nThis recipe will stay on my counter for awhile because I know my family will be requesting them frequently!!!!",
