They were soft and cakey, a little crumbly, and very delicious. I added white chocolate chips, which I felt really added to the delicious flavour combo. We used a food processor to grind up the tea, and it worked perfectly. They were really chocolaty, which I personally loved, but someone who isn't such a big fan of chocolate might want to use less chocolate or a semi-sweet cocoa powder. A great recipe, if you are a tea lover you MUST try it, and I can't wait to try it with other varieties of tea.",
