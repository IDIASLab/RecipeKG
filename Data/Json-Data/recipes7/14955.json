I left the cilantro off of my husband\u2019s, and after tasting it, I added a sprinkle of fresh ground black pepper to mine. Otherwise no changes and we thought it had just the right combination and amounts of spices. It would also be good with some shredded chicken added. 10/9/19: Found myself making this again, but this time I didn't have coconut milk or cannellini beans so made the following changes: I measured 1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes in a glass liquid measuring cup, then added 2% milk up to the 1 cup mark and substituted that for the coconut milk, I added 1/3 cup Jasmine rice, added right away so it would cook the entire time, I used Great Northern beans and added 1/4 cup peanuts during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I cut the salt in half and added 1/4 tsp of pepper. I did use the olive oil, but I'm thinking it's not really necessary, so next time I will leave that out to cut the calories a little. The stew was still great with these changes. I had about 1.5 cups of the stew left after lunch, and I pureed this with 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 cup 2% milk, then added the corn from 1 large ear of leftover corn on the cob and heated to make a lovely coconut-butternut-curry corn chowder for lunch the next day.",
