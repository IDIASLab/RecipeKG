The problem is getting there by way of the recipe instructions. I maintain a substantial garden and the ingredients all came from there. I do a lot of canning. I would love to see someone from AllRecipes prep 12 tomatoes 6 green peppers 6 red peppers and 10 onions through a food processor in 30 minutes. Good luck. Further the stated quantity or yield is 6 pints. Ha! It is more like 6 quarts. A recipe of that size exceeds the capability of most home kitchens we just don't have pots etc. of that size. Well at 11 pints I ran out of jars and had to throw a small bit away. This process took me one-half a day. Again looking at the times offered in the recipe when I add them up this should be over and done in 55 minutes although the \"ready in\" time is 3 hours 15 minutes. Huh? Feel free to contact me if I can help!",
