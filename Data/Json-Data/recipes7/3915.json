This is actually a recipe from Indonesia, and they use a different type of cooking tool, which is heavy steel and the dough cooked on the stove. Since I don't have that equipment, I am using the muffin baking tray and baking them instead, but they still come out very good and tasty. You can freeze some of them; also reheat with microwave, or serve in a party for snacks.",

Given that background we love these they are soft inside crunchy outside and a good snack size when mini. I think they're just sweet enough but this is what I did: I used brown rice flower instead of white and my coconut was sweetened because that's what I had on hand.",

We have cut out processed wheat in our diet as it packs on the pounds and try to limit our sugar intake, so baking a treat becomes a challenge.  Coconut oil (in coconut milk) is a good fat that burns bad fat, so this makes this a bonus for baking!  We did use sweetened coconut (on hand and needed to be used up), decreased salt to 1/2 tsp of salt and sprinkled on \"whey low\" - a natural sugar alternative that tastes like sugar,  but low on glycemic index.  Added 3 chocolate chips in about 1/4 of the mini muffin cups (YUM!) for an extra special treat.   They slid right out of the silicone cups.  I forgot they wouldn't rise, so I filled the cups 2/3 and they came out short, and may have even fallen.  Next time I will fill the cups all the way.  This recipe is a great base to start with, though good on its own.  We will be making these again!",
