The only changes made were because of not having some of the ingredients - I used 1 box of couscous (about half of what was called for) with 1/3/4 cup water 1 T powdered ginger instead of fresh and feta cheese instead of bleu cheese. Since I live alone I've eaten it about 8 times in the last two weeks and STILL want more! Healthy and delicious.",
