It tasted sour in spite of the ingredients but I do have to say that I did not have all the ingredients on hand and had to substitute or eliminate. I used whole wheat bread because I had that on hand. I had no almond extract but substituted vanilla in place of it. Perhaps it would have made a difference in the taste. I don't feel that having the ingredients listed though would make a difference. It is the buttermilk that came through as sour and yet it was fresh buttermilk not expired. Funny that buttermilk pancakes and waffles have always been fine for me. Nonetheless I would not care to try it again.",
