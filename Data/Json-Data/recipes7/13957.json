But I modified from what I saw on the video when making this recipe. Recipe states to chop up the strawberries or use frozen, well the strawberries in the video seemed to be mashed, so I mashed my strawberries as well. I ended up using only 4 large croissants and my muffin wells were standard size and the amount of croissant pieces made actually 16 muffins and the cream cheese sauce managed to extend to all 16, I just had to add a little more strawberries to match. Overall, very nice. We really liked them.",

Hubby and I loved them!\nMine didn't  look quite as pretty, but after powder sugar looked good.   \nI used all 8oz. of cream cheese by error......still wonderful.\nCut back sugar to 1/4 c and 6 small croissants instead...... all worked out.  \nWill make for brunch soon.......sure my company will love these different little treats.    Adjusted sugar was perfect!   So glad I tried, thanks!",

It's not too sweet and the powder sugar on top makes a big difference in the taste. The leftovers (which weren't many) we toasted up in the toaster oven and then added the powder sugar were also great! Will make again thanks for the recipe!",
