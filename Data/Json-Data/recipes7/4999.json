I used one 16 ounce bag of cole slaw mix; two bags would have been one too many. I also used lite mayo, which was just fine. I used four stalks of celery; I didn't want this to be a celery salad.

I also add about 1/4 cup vinegar to the mayo/sugar mix to help soften the cabbage. Serve as is or in Pita bread pockets.",

The fourth liked them both but preferred the slight taste of dill in the Kroger's brand. They were all thrilled when I told them the one they liked was homemade and EASY to make! I used a bag of coleslaw instead of dicing it myself making it even easier. Thanks!",

I used a 1 lb package of imitation crab (chunk style) a bag of coleslaw with carrots and red cabbage 3 diced green onions some diced celery a handful of shredded carrots and a tbl of dill. I mixed mayo with sugar as written. Basically I used as much of the Ingredients as filled up my serving bowl. I prepared the dish the night before and served it with pocket bread. After it sat there was some liquid in the bottom of the bowl that needed to be drained. It was a tasty hit. I think next time I might add additional dill for a little more flavor.

I tablespoon of sugar and left out the onions (Not an onion eater) I added Old Bay Seasoning few dashes of pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Next time I will cut up a few chunks of pineapple and add a tablespoon of pineapple juice instead of the lemon juice. I LOVED this salad. Goes will with grilled salmon and grilled chicken.
