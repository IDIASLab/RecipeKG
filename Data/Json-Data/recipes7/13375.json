I was expecting a toffee taste but I think brown sugar would need to be added. My grandson loved the popcorn because he didn't have to bite into a big popcorn ball. I added the syrup to a large bowl to mix the syrup and quickly mixed the popcorn. Then I poured the popcorn on a parchment lined baking pan and broke apart into chunks. I think next time I would add some peanuts and maybe some food coloring to make the popcorn more festive.",
