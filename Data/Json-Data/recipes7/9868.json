Serve topped with diced raw onion, sour cream, and shredded Cheddar cheese for a mouth-watering delight! Believe it or not, the secret is the ketchup (NOT catsup) that adds just the right flavor to the sauce; use more or less as desired. Use sauteed fresh mushrooms for a special treat! Seasonings may be added to taste. If you want it really hot, use hot chili beans and add more chili powder and cayenne pepper or include hot peppers!",

But I liked thickness.\" The consistency of this chili was perfect but the taste didn't really wow us. Between the 15 oz. tomato sauce and the 1 c. of ketchup it was heavy on the tomato taste and that coupled w/ the overall sweetness just put it into a no-repeat-stack. I love trying out different chili recipes and I can only imagine that this one would definitely appeal to many people who prefer that touch of sweetness but for us it just wasn't a success.",
