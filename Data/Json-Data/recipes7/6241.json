I thought I did something wrong but I read the recipe over and over and didn't see any error on my part.  We ended up throwing them out.  I tried making them a second time and they came out REALLY GOOD! This is what I did for 2 servings:  Whipped a batter of 4 oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 CUP FLOUR, 1 teaspoon BAKING POWDER, 2 teaspoons confectioners sugar, , TWO EGGS, 2 teaspoons softened butter, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 teaspoons fine fresh lemon zest, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  They had more of a pancake consistency and the flavor was way better too!",

I misread the instructions  and added fresh squeezed lemon juice into the actual batter and as a result, the cream cheese batter had a nice lemon zing to it very much like lemon cheesecake.  I made these into silver-dollar sized pancakes and the only problem I had with using butter on the griddle was they browned really quickly around the outer edges. I did not dust with confectioner's sugar instead I added 3 teaspoons of granulated sugar to the batter. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will defintely make again to serve at brunch.",

I think these would benefit from having some lemon zest and juice added to them and not just some juice squirted on top. I had no problem w/ the cream cheese flavor (I LOVE cream cheese) but these hardly even tasted like that. These fell very flat for us...I did end up topping them w/ 'Microwave Lemon Curd' which I used a mix of lemons and limes and that along w/ some whipped cream livened these up for me (hubby still wasn't a fan). I most likely will not be make these again sorry but they were interesting enough to try.",
