Due to allergies, substituted a safe-for-me gluten free flour blend for all 2.5 cups of flours and some ground vanilla bean (whisked into the dry stuff) for the vanilla extract. I noticed the recipe has baking soda but no liquid acidic ingredient to start the rising action. So I substituted 2.5 teaspoons of corn-free baking powder for the baking soda. It made a terrific difference in texture! They are lighter now and stay tender, as long as you don't overbake them, which I'm prone to do. I broke with tradition and added the raisins to the creamed ingredients to hydrate them a bit before added the flours and oats. Easier on my mixing arm and plumper raisins in the end.\nMy friends don't realize these are GF!",
