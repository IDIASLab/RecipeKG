Here are my changes:  1)  3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans in mild sauce, NOT drained.  2)  1 (15 oz) can chili beans in medium sauce, 3) I omitted the celery and tabasco sauce, 4)1 jalapeno instead of chile peppers, 5) 3 tablespoons of bacon bits, 6) 1 cup of beer 7) Instead of using 2 (28oz) cans of diced tomatoes with juice, I used 3 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes and 1 (14 1/2 oz) can of diced tomatoes with basil/oregano/garlic. 8) I cooked this in a slow cooker for 8 hours the day before, let it sit overnight and heated it up and served it the next day with cheese on top.  I also froze the left overs and it taste even better!!",

I just won a chili cookoff with it so that might be a large part of the reason.  The judges and the crowd loved it.  I ran out within 30 minutes of it being opened to the public to taste. I did make a few changes: I used 3 lbs of cubed chuck steak in place of the ground chuck because I really like a meaty chili (obvisously so did the judges), I cooked 4 slices of bacon, then crumbled for the bacon bits and sauted the celery, onion and garlic in the drippings.  My biggest piece of advice is prepare it the day before, let cool overnight, degrease really well and then reheat; the chili really developes a great flavor by doing this. I used my crockpot on low to keep it warm the day I served it.",

Used chicken broth enstead of beer.  At first it was too spicy(not for me but for my husband and kids) so I went online for a quick fix.  Turns out you just need to puree a can of pineapple to tone down the spice.  I was pretty leary about this so I added it slowly, tasting it each time.  I did end up using the whole can and it was perfect.  All the flavors without the burn.  Thanks for the great recipe.",

Most of the ingredients are from a can and taste like it.  If you want it truly hot, better add more \"hot sauce\" as he puts it.  Not trying to be critical, but this isn't authentic chile.  Pass on this and try another chile recipe that has the word \"Texas\" in it.",

I've had as good or better chili with half the time, work, and cost! Overall, this was decent but it didn't knock our socks off. The list of ingredients was just too long, I was tired just getting to the end of it...(my thought was, whew! did I forget anything?!!!) Nothing special, I won't make this again. I even had to throw out the leftovers. I didn't even bother to add the cost of all the ingredients!!! Overall, this was very disappointing. Thanks for posting so we could try anyway.",

                "reviewBody": "My husband loved this chili.  I will definitely make again.  I used 1 lb ground HOT italian turkey sausage, 1 lb HOT italian pork sausage and 1 lb ground round.  It turned out to be a wonderful flavor combination and much more healthy than 3 lbs of beef.  Since there were so many spices already in my HOT sausage blends I omitted the extra peppers and tabasco.  It was still quite spicy. I cut the chili powder down to 3 Tablespoons.  I was worried the full 4 T (=1/4 cup) would be too overpowering and mask the other flavors.  I also used a whole can of beer.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce. For the diced tomatoes I used 4 of the regular 14 oz cans - 1 petite diced and 3 regular size diced with chili spices included.  I also added a fifth can of petite diced which had lime juice and cilantro in it. I did not drain any of them.  Turned out wonderfully.  The flavors were great and the tomatoes of different sizes cooked up for great texture.  You can cetainly modify this recipe for your own tastes as far as spiceyness and heat.  We like spicey chili but for my 5 year to eat it I have to go a little lighter on the spice.  This recipe is difinitely worth the time and trouble.  Will make again....and again!  Thanks for sharing.",
