The most important thing is that it needs spices cinnamon nutmeg all spice and or traditional pumpkin pie spice depending on your preferences. It is some what dry and a spicy glaze adds a lot to the scones. Last night I tried something new I added one and one half table spoons of fancy molasses to the to the pumpkin puree along with a half tspn of vanilla. It made a subtle but greatly enjoyed difference. It becomes a scone with complex flavours. I rated this at four because it is a good starting point but as it is written it is bland and unexciting. My sweetie prefers these to the ones down stairs at Starbucks.",

The ratios are great for a proper scone texture magically without a lot of sugar or fat. If you don't change the ratio but add spices for flavor I think you have a perfect almost healthy scone with great pumpkin spice flavor. What a miracle. Here are my changes: I cut in 2T of butter instead of 1. I added 1 heaping teaspoon of cinnamon 1 heaping teaspoon of all pumpkin spice 1/2 T vanilla extract. I also always use a heaping teaspoon of baking powder. I did half whole wheat flour/half white flour. I also did 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 c light brown sugar. If I was baking them again I would add a little more sugar or use all a dark brown sugar...or I'd add some molasses or maple syrup. I felt like I wanted them a little sweeter. Of course a topping or sprinkle of sugar on top also would round out that flavor brighten up the sweetness a bit. They really are great. Use the recipe as a base and add flavor with cinnamon nutmeg ginger or vanilla etc. The pumpkin puree gives it plenty of moisture with almost no added fat with the little butter you add.",
