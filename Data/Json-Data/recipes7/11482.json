There's no need to peel them as the skins aren't bitter like the larger cukes also most of your nutrients are in the skin so it makes it a bit healthier for you. To remove some liquid from your cukes put a paper towel on the bottom of your bowl then slice your cukes and salt them. After they sit for a while remove the wet paper towel and use another dry one to pat the cukes if there's any moisture left. Now you have a healthier cuke that the sauce will stick to better. I don't use sugar in my recipe but that's a matter of preferance I guess also if I have cider vinegar I'll use that. Overall it's a good recipe. --Bear--",
