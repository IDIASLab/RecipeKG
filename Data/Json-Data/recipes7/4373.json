I had never made crepes before and it took a little practice to get them to come out right. The trick I found was to use a VERY lightly buttered / oiled pan. I couldn t find farmers cheese so I used unripened goats milk cheese. It has the same consistency as farmers cheese but as it turns out it is a little more tart. If using this cheese again I d add a little more sugar to compensate. With everything made I was now ready to roll up some blintzes! I had a tough time getting them to stay together. I googled some blintz images and saw that a lot were made into square pockets instead of rolls. I put a dab of filling in the middle of the crepe folded the sides in and then folded in the top and bottom. I found it much easier than rolling and it stayed together a lot better plus I could get a lot more filling in them this way! I tried frying a couple up right away but this was a mistake. They flopped open in the pan. I let the others sit for a bit and they firmed up nicely and were much easier to fry. All in all a great recipe and the end product was delicious. I ll definitely be making this again!",
