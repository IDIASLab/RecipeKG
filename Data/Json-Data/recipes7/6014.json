Unfortunately, most honey cakes turn out to be dry, brick-like things, inedible except with a hot beverage. Some call honey cake the fruitcake of the Jewish people. BUT NOT THIS ONE! This cake is genuinely moist and yummy. It will serve about 12 guests at a holiday meal, but I promise that your family will chisel away at it until it's gone before the morning comes.",

This is Marcy Goldman's \"Majestic and Moist New Yesr's Honey Cake\" recipe out of her cookbook, A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking. The only variation is nutmeg instead of allspice, canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and the sliced or slivered almonds on top. None the less the very best Honey cake ever. I've been making it for years for holiday's and all year round and would never think of using a different recipe. Two notes, almonds are sprinkled on top prior to baking and you should let it cool in the pan for about 15 - 20 min and then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before placing it on a serving platter.",

I followed the recipe except for the cloves (I didn't have it on hand) so I used allspice. Thank you for this recipe. It's the best honey cake recipe I have tried. Very most and had a great flavor.",
