Not cakey  at all.  I live at elevation (5000 ft) so I took it out after 30 minutes.  I also cut the sugar to 1 c white and 1/3 c Splenda brown sugar blend, added two tsp. of brown sugar to the butter for the glaze and melted it in the microwave until it was like a caramel sauce then added to the confectioners sugar.  It was plenty sweet enough and will cut the white sugar back to 2/3 c next time and toast the pecans.  SO GOOD!!",
