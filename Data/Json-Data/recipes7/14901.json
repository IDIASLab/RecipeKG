Every now and then you find a recipe that just catches you totally by surprise, and this is one of them.  Never, EVER would I think this cobbler was made with zucchini because, yes, it really does taste like an apple cobbler, and a good one, too!  The recipe doesn\u2019t tell you how large the zucchini should be cut, mine was small, probably about 1/2 inch dice., and I didn\u2019t remove the seeds.   Next time I will cut a little larger.  The components that bring this together so successfully are the apple pie spice itself (used Apple Spice Pie Mix from this site) and the fact that the zucchini texture is very similar to cooked apples.  We\u2019re not into super sweet food these days, so I did cut the amount of sugar about in half (personal taste here).  It has a warm, delicate flavor, and this one is memorable.  Well done, this one\u2019s a keeper!",
