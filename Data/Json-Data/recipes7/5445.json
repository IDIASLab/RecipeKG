I generally add a shake of salt to my rice while cooking.  \n\nAdditionally, I tasted while cooking the sauce and had to make a few slight changes.  I doubled the curry powder, added a good shake of red pepper and an additional dash of salt.  I grated too much cheese, so I added it to the sauce (about an additional 1/2 cup). I also added some salt and curry powder to the shrimp while cooking it (but did not put the liquid from the shrimp pan into the casserole).  Lastly, next time I will add the rice, shrimp and sauce in layers.  I almost stirred the sauce (as opposed to inserting with the tines of the fork) and it still did not get to the bottom of the rice.  This would also be good with some steamed brocolli or sweet peas added prior to baking.\n\nLove it!",

In my opinion, it is one of those that absolutely tastes better on the second day. Glad you all enjoy!",

All in all it was tasty! *Update* Was making this dish tonight for the third time and decided to sub quinoa for the rice. We really liked it, and I will use the quinoa in place of the rice from now on-so much more nutritious for you! I also have upped the curry to a rounded TBS.",
