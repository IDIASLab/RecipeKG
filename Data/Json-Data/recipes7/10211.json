                "reviewBody": "Made this for fun this weekend and although it tasted pretty good some adjustments need to be made. The recipe as written needs to be used with a 10\" Bundt pan or two smaller pans. Using a non-stick spray is not usually a good idea for a pan and cake like this so I suggest butter and flour instead. Cook time will be between 75 and 90 minutes. Stand mixer is nice but not necessary though I do suggest using a hand mixer to thoroughly combine the ingredients. The Kit Kats should be doubled or they get lost in the batter. This really isn't a Kit Kat cake more like a vanilla cake with Kit Kats. The frosting is okay and does pour nice over the cake. Over all the flavor was pretty good and making it was pretty fun.",

                "reviewBody": "We all enjoyed this cake. It is very dense and like the other reviews it is basically a vanilla cake with crushed candy inside. I agree that you can double the candy if desired. The candies do take a back seat to the dense cake. I used Kit Kats Whoppers and Twix- basically a bunch of leftover Halloween candy which is what I wanted to use up. You can mix and match with any chocolate candy to your tastes and it won't ruin the cake. This is not a recipe that I would go out and buy Kit Kats for to make over and over again throughout the year but I think this will be a yearly tradition for us to make out of Halloween candy. Thanks for the recipe! Very tasty!",
