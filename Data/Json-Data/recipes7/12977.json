Some reviewers reduced the sugar but for me, I felt like it needed every bit of the sugar. I did, however, use 1/2 white, 1/2 dark brown sugar. I liked the idea of adding heat so I added 1T Sweet Chili Sauce. I also added some freshly grated ginger along with the ground ginger and used pineapple juice instead of water. I loved this dish. I used chicken legs and I cut up the leftovers and saved them in the sauce for noodle bowls the next day. They were fabulous. The sauce would also be great as a salad dressing if you added a little rice wine vinegar. It would also make a great marinade. This recipe is awesome and I will be making it in some form on a regular basis. The possibilities are endless!",
