I found these perfectly sweet - not too much so. I used 8 1-inch slices of Como bread and had quite a bit of egg mixture left, so I'm thinking this recipe can stretch almost double without making more batter, FYI. We had ours with fresh raspberries and blackberries and it was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!",
