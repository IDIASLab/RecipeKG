I made this vegan for my daughter and doubted it's success because I really don't like many of the vegan substitutes, but I was wrong.  I used half  reduced sugar vanilla almond milk and half nondairy creamer for the milk (and then omitted honey), mozzarella shreds (P$$t brand by Kroger or GOVEGGIE cheesy bliss are good, some are awful), and homemade vegan parmesan \"cheese\" for the original (recipe follows), which gave it a nutty taste. I also added a few \"sausage\" crumbles to sub for the sage that I did not have. Rubbed sage is so strong and my crumbles have a sage flavor.  I misread the instructions and mixed the spinach and mushroom fillings into one, but it was fine. It  just meant one thicker layer and one thinner and totally unnoticeable. I also left squash chunky for texture. So Good!  Will definitely make again.\nVegan Parmesan \"cheese\" topping:\n3/4 c raw cashews,\n3 Tbs nutritional yeast flakes (NOT brewers yeast),\n3/4 tsp salt,\n1/4 tsp garlic powder.\nProcess all until resembles grated parmesan.

Second I simply cut up the butternut squash into half moons and sauteed them on the stovetop until soft alongside some onions. Third I only used about 3 cups of unsweetened almond milk and 1 cup of Greek yogurt alongside 3 tbsps of flour in place of corn starch---this still gave me plenty of sauce for the lasagna. Lastly I used fresh spinach and just rinsed and drained it and added it all in a single layer over the first layer of noodles. It worked out pretty well and made for a nice lasagna. Oh I left out the honey too--didn't think it was necessary at all. I would make it again and definitely put mushrooms in next time!",
