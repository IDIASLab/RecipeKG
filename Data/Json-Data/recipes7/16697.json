        "description": "I created this recipe after having a similar cake in the cafe of a local bookstore I worked at years ago. I never forgot how delicious the dessert was, with the tartness of berries and citrus that complemented perfectly with the sweetness of the cake, the cheesecake layer, and white chocolate, so I decided to recreate it myself. The dessert from the cafe was actually mass-produced and shipped in frozen, so this is a fresh, homemade version that tastes even better than the original, if I do say so myself (haha).This elegant cake mix cheesecake stacks tart summer berries and lemon curd against creamy lime whip.",

                "reviewBody": "It was pretty straightforward to make. There were only a few problems throughout making it. In the curd it says to have 3 tablespoons of lemon zest but you only use 1 and it doesn't tell you where to put the remaining 2 tablespoons. I mixed it into the cake batter and it turned out fine. The only other thing is that the cake gets so wet because of the berries that burst during cooking. My uncrusted cake crumbled when turned out of the pan. I recommend reducing the amount of water to 3/4 cup and take 3 tablespoons of oil out. It turned out fine doing that. Also break up the blackberries if they are too big they are very strong in the cake. Make sure you refrigerate your lemon curd and place some cling wrap on it while its warm so it doesn't form a skin. Keep everything in the fridge to keep cool though it helps it all spread smoothly.",
