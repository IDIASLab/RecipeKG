I added chopped almonds to mine and used coconut oil instead of olive. BTW olive oil should not be used in sweets or in much baking because 1. The taste and 2. It can't hold the temperature for most baking and gives off a toxic when it hits its smoking point. Coconut oil on the other hand gave these brownies an awesome smell and it has a fairly high smoking point. Also I double boiled the chocolate and the oil together and then added them to the sugar and tofu. So I say this is a good starter recipe with some minor changes.",
