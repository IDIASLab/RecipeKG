The dressing was just a little sweet for us (personal taste preference) and I did add a little bit of sesame oil to the dressing (I would do that again). A garnish of some chopped peanuts would be nice and I'll do that in the future. I thought the amount of cucumbers was disproportionate to the pasta so I stopped at 1 cuke and that was more than enough for us. We love Asian noodle salads this is a good one and I definitely would make again. Nice side dish to Mandarin Orange Chicken.",
