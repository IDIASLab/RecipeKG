The subtle sweetness of the sugar meshed with the tangy lemon juice was superb.  Thank you so much for recipe!",

I grew up in NW PA on a Dairy Farm where we grew a lot of COB; I've always cooked it the same way salted boiling water, add the corn, cover and remove from heat.i don't know what compelled me to check out ideas but I found 2 yours with lemon juice and sugar and another with vinegar and sugar..used 2 pots and lemon juice won hands down. The vinegar and sugar was better than my original method but after 30 years will ever use anything but sugar and lemon juice again. The leftover corn that I butter and wrap for easy microwave reheating stayed crisper and didn't have the mushy spots. Thanks for a great recipe !",

When I read the recipe and reviews I thought this is crazy, it can't make a difference to add sugar and lemon juice but it honestly did.  It really brought out the flavor of the corn.  And I also didn't believe that letting it sit for 10 minutes would thoroughly cook the corn but it did, perfectly.  I would recommend when putting the corn in making sure the water comes back to a boil for a few seconds before turning it off to let it sit or you can keep it on the lowest lowest setting for the 10 min.  I will be making corn this way from now on!!",
