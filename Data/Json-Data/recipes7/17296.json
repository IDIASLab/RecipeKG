In Germany there are special poppy seed grinders, but you can use a mortar and pestle. Don't use a regular spice grinder, as poppy seeds contain a lot of oil and your grinder will get clogged up.",

The poppy seed seemed to be to thin to spread on the dough,  I have to say it was one of the best coffee cakes  I ever made. I used fresh ground poppy seed. I would put a little less milk to thicken the poppy seed and roll the dough thin, the length and width of a cookie sheet .  Really a keeper!!!",
