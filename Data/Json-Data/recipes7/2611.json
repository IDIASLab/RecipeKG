It can get very floury...only 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 and a 1/2 and I add a few drops of vanilla essence to make up for the difference. I like to bake it in two 8 inch round cake pans and poke each layer as a separate cake with a separate topping for layering afterwards. THE KEY IS IN THE MILK MIXTURE: Do not use any regular milk at all! Instead go to a store and buy \"condensed milk\" or \"leite condensado\" in the international section of the grocery store. It is much thicker and stickier and will not make your cake so soggy!!!! Mix this with 1/2 the can of coconut milk and it will be enough for two 8 inch rounds for sure. Lastly be sure to use either fresh coconut shavings or sweetened shavings. The smushier the flakes the better. My husband and all of his Brazilian friends say I make this cake just like it's made by the Brazilian Bakeries and their own Mom's- Give it a shot!!!",

When the cake was done it has too heavy texture. I used only 1/2 milk mixture because the cake wasn t be able to absorb all the mixture. Finally the cake wasn t moist at the bottom and in the middle. I will definitely make this cake again but with other amount of flour. UPDATE I have made this cake for 2 times now with modifications and it turned out fantastic. I used only 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 cup flour and 1 5 cup sugar. The texture was great and fluffy and absorbed the liquid perfectly. As to the milk mixture I followed Tara s recommendations and used can of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 can coconut milk. Very good and very delicious cake.",

Seems that everybody agrees that it has almost twice as much flour as you really need (minus one star) twice as much sugar (minus another star) and the regular milk is totally not necessary (knock off another star). That might make it a two star recipe but in my personal opinion if you don't add at least a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter the cake will basically smell and taste like scrambled eggs with sugar and orange juice in them. You need the vanilla to get rid of the overly eggy smell.",

But after making it my baking instincts kicked in and I knew what changes it still needed. The 2nd time I made it this is what I changed: I continued with the already mentioned changes but I added 1/2 tsp table salt to the flour/baking powder mixture (without any salt all baked goods lack a certain \"zing\" that makes all the other ingredients come to life). I also used 2 fresh oranges to make the juice and I added the zest of 1/2 an orange to the coconut milk/sweetened condensed milk mixture. That was a great but not overwhelming addition of orange flavor. I baked the cake in a 10 inch angel food pan for 35 minutes and after it cooled I cut it in half along its \"equator\" with a serrated bread knife so I could soak the bottom layer with the milk mixture and then replaced the top half and soaked again (as someone else had mentioned). I used a pastry brush to \"lather\" the sides with the milk mixture as well. I also lightly toasted the coconut which was the typical sweetened shredded coconut not flaked but that was just because it was what I had on hand. Toasted coconut is always better than untoasted. This second time was absolutely perfect! I posted photos of the cake whole as well as cut open. The original photo is not this recipe.",
