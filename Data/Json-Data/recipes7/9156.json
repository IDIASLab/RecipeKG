I knew in looking at the ingredients that if I followed this recipe exactly, it would be too hot for us.  We like things spicy, but not \"fiery\" as the recipe author describes this chili.  I cut back the black pepper and the red pepper flakes, and it was still spicy good (and just about perfect for us).  Unless you really like it HOT, I'd suggest you start out modestly on the heat ingredients and then add more to suit your taste.  This is my first effort at turkey chili, and we enjoyed this recipe.  It will be made again.",
