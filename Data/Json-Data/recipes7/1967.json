In my case the personal touches included using my own tomato sauce I put up from my garden and only because fresh herbs are happily in my garden right now using just a little (not too much!) fresh basil parsley and the slightest bit of oregano. I needed no water and no sugar. For a little more substantial dinner I saut\u00e9ed multi-colored bell peppers and mushrooms in addition to the onion and garlic. Oh and as I always do when I cook I sipped some wine in this case an appropriate Montepulciano d Abruzzo. As I was simmering all the ingredients together (including the sausage) I mindlessly tossed in half of my glass of wine into the pot which I promptly refilled. As for the cheese just as my grandmother and mother did I used a blend of imported Pecorino-Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Hubs was out of town tonight so I got to make whatever I felt for and this hit the spot.",
