It is really a sauce (because there is no flour in it) but you can eat it for breakfast over biscuits, eat it at room temperature like a soup at lunch or the way we ate it at his house over rice with hoe cakes for dinner.  It is simple to make but tastes so good. It keeps in the refrigerator for several days and I think it tastes better the next day.",

My father in law actually made this for me when my husband and I started dating (and he made it for my husband growing up) and I didn't ask him how he made it before he passed. My husband asks about this quite often but I didn't know how to make it. This is EXACTLY how he made it, only he added a little \"green\" spice I didn't catch. I did add a half tsp. each of basil and oregano and that was it exactly. I only had a small taste but my husband and kids ate almost all of it over parmesan noodles. You made our day. And sometimes, it's really the simplest things that get you every time. Thank you.",
