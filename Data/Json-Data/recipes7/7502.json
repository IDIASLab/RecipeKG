I did use the optional walnuts and added a heaping handful of raisins. I used a Texas sized muffin tin and got half a dozen huge muffins. Before popping them in the oven I topped them with a little turbinado sugar for that nice added little crunch. These baked up beautifully at 400 for a little over 20 minutes. Perfect with a cup of hot tea!",

They are excellent as is but even when I make modifications (substitute milk with 1 Tbsp vinegar for buttermilk increase or decrease sugar replace some of the flour with WW flour) they turn out very well. They are moist for the first 2 or 3 days in a bag at room temp but then get stale so I freeze half to pull out later. Definitely worth a try if you want a yummy healthy muffin recipe.",
