I took a few liberties: Because I didn't have ginger I sprinkled a little rum maybe 1 tablespoon over the chopped apples. I didn't peel the apples I liked the rustic texture. To the flour topping I added 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup of rolled oats to give it more crunch. I baked it sheet pan-style for about 35 minutes and it made for an easy way to serve it to a crowd for a morning birthday gathering. With a strong cup of coffee naturally!",
