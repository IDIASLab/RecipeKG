My kids and I are licking the spoons, and pots as I write this :)  I followed the recipe exactly, except I decreased the sugar to 4 1/2 Cups.  I used very ripe pears and the jam is REALLY sweet. I could have almost used even less sugar and it would have been sweet enough.  But it is still very, very good.  Thank you for this keeper!!  Now I am hoping our pear tree will produce as well next summer so I can make this again!!! :)",
