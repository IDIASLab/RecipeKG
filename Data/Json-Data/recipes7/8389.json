                "reviewBody": "well...I'm not a fan. Sorry I was excited about this recipe and since 4% cottage cheese is all I buy I thought the ingredients would work well. Obviously it didn't. While easy to follow the raw mix tasted rather nice. Yes I'm one to taste something with raw eggs in it I don't apologize for that I totally need to know if the flavor seems to be good. And it was. As I followed to a T placed in the dish and put in the oven I looked eagerly in the window of the oven pacing back and forth the smell seemed suttled and looked like it was right on track but the baking took longer to get completely brown on top over an hour and a half so I pulled it out waited until it cooled. Used a cutting circle for the center(for presentation) and proceeded to scoop out a corner for tasting but to see all this water like substance pouring out into the spot I scooped out & defungled over my dismay it was just gushing with fluids. I thought ok?! tasted the portion I scooped it was a bit odd in flavor & texture. Hubby also tried it and said tastes like weird cheese. Yes okay that's the thought as well just not out loud. Each one of my kids said \"we don't like it. What is it?\" Needless to say I went back and looked & looked over the recipe a dozen times thinking what is wrong with this recipe there is no water in it other then in the cottage cheese..possibly should have strained the cottage cheese with cheese cloth 1st? Not sure won't make again. Sorry.",
