Usually, when I cook, I like to play around with the ingredients and so I rarely make something the same way twice. But this meatloaf was as close to perfect as I could imagine. I tried to be specific in my directions but there is no way to determine ahead of time how wet the mixture will be after adding the vegetables. How wet is too wet is hard to describe, but it is better to err on the side of moisture, I'd think.",

I used a package of Costco's organic ground beef (1 lb 3 oz) red bell rather than green and only half the recipe. I did use 1/4 cup of oats and 1/4 cup of Progresso Italian bread crumbs. That particular meat tends to be a little dry in my opinion and so the mix of oats and crumbs made it just a tad dry. I did think it could have used a little more seasoning but next time I'll take care of that by using a little more salt and maybe Italian seasoning mix--or maybe make a little more of the topping and put that inside the loaf mix. I could have used a little more Tabasco in the topping but that's a personal issue. This will make a very good sandwich tomorrow for lunch so we thank you for our dinner and our future lunch!",
