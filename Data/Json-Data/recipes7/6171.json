The sugar on the top did look like it started to burn a little even after around 50 mins so I took it out thinking it might not be ready yet inside but it was fine tasted great. I guess I need to just learn how to spot when it's ready. I am now however amazed at how much sugar goes into cakes! are they all like this?? very tasty and easy to understand instructions. nice one.",
