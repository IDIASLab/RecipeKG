This is a delicious and unusual variation on plain old French Toast.  Try it, I guarantee you'll love it!  Thanks to the Blue Moon Cafe in Baltimore for the inspiration. Not for the diet conscious, but it tastes so good you won't care! Put bread in a warm oven to keep heated until the rest of the bread is done, if needed. Serve with a dollop of butter and warmed pure maple syrup, if desired.",

I only used 2 eggs omitted the heavy cream used 3/4 cup of soymilk instead of 1/2 cup 2% milk used vegetable oil instead of butter and Life cereal instead of Cap'n Crunch (far less than the 1/2 package suggested by the recipe). Also maybe it's just my stove but I partiallly burned the first slice at 3 minutes on medium-high heat. I cooked the rest of them for 1 minute on medium heat and they cooked perfectly. With these changes it was great! My family loved it. I will probably make again next time we need to use up some challah.",
