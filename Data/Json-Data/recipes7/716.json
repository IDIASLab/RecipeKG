The bok choy and peppers add crunch and the soy sauce adds just the right amount of saltiness. I used maple cured bacon which is a little less salty then regular smoked bacon and it turned out great! I'm a cilantro lover so I added cilantro according to the recipe however I think that those who don't care for the strong flavor of cilantro could easily substitute parsley and not miss a beat. This is a great recipe and I will be making it again and again. Yum!",

This recipe melded all the ingredients perfectly. You have the traditional asian ingredients soy sauce sesame oil and green onion which really liven up the traditional old potato salad. The bacon adds a nice crunchy texture the cilantro adds the cool crispiness and the sugar mellows out the saltiness nicely. The only thing I did differently was to had less mayo.

This recipe made great use of the choi as well as the green onions and cilantro also in the box and my girls LOVE potato salad so this seemed like a good recipe to try. The only change that I made was to skip the dry hot mustard because I don't have any. Nevertheless it was a big hit with the whole family. The Asian flavors are really clear and it is such a fun and different approach to potato salad than the norm. I just made a double batch again today to bring to a neighborhood potluck and hope that it is widely enjoyed. I know we'll be making it again as a family in any case. Yum!",

My bacon was on it's way out too so I doubled up on the bok choy and onions and omitted the salt since the soy sauce was included.
