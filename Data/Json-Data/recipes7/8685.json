I didn't do anything with the \"basics\" meaning the flour sugar baking powder...however I didn't have tangerines but had a few blood oranges left that I wanted to use up. I microwaved the cranberries and juice for about 90 seconds instead of simmering on the stove and then let them cool. After everything was mixed in I on a whim threw in about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips and omitted the sugar sprinkle on top. Theses are amazing just a little sweet and probably because I added the chocolate. Next time I would go with 3/4 cup sugar. Just as an afterthought...I might also reduce the temp to 350 for myself. 375 browned them quite quickly and the inside wasn't quite ready.",

Use only the berries in the batter & keep the reduce juice as a syrup when serving instead of sugaring the muffin top. added some crushed pecan nuts - optional. Great basic recipe. simple & delicious. I especially liked boiling down the dried berries with the juice. Nice touch - a big thanks of appreciation for sharing!",
