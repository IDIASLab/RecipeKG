First there is no way to simmer that many vegetables in that much milk and have everything cook evenly. I left out the parsnips and turnips and still had more than 12 cups of cubed veggies. I ended up simmering the veggies in two batches and then straining off the liquid to mix in the cream cheese so I didn't pulverize the veggies trying to get a smooth sauce. Then carefully folded the cheese sauce back into the veggie mix. If it hadn't tasted SO good I would never bother trying to work out the kinks but I'm sure I'll be attempting this again.",
