This recipe has a lot going on but very little going for it. I decided to give it a shot to see if something interesting might play out from the extensive ingredient list. I agree with the previous reviewer that the prep-time is much more than the recipe indicates. Sweetheart is Hawaiian and after the first bowl he did not care for it.",

The instructions are definitely way too complicated the point of a slow cooker is to minimize the work. I just mixed the chicken and bbq sauce together first and then threw everything else in (except the pineapple) and cooked on low all day. Used minced onion and garlic puree crushed tomatoes 2 tbsp reg chili powder and 1tbsp chipotle chili powder raspberry chipotle salsa (all I could find). Definitely cut up the pineapple chunks they are too big right out of the can. The only thing I would try and fix is the sauce ratio. There seemed to be too much sauce and not enough chicken and beans.",
