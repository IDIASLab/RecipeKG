Rolled pancakes filled with cheese, fruit or both, they make a delicious dessert. Sweet blintzes carry on the tradition of cheese and fruit fillings. Serve either with sour cream and powdered sugar, or maple or chocolate syrup. We like to serve them with fruit pie fillings, like apples, blueberries, or cherries, and then put a dollop of sour cream and powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar on them.",
