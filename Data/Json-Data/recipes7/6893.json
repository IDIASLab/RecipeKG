To cut back on the amount of chopping I did as others as well as the submitter suggested and bought a bag of coleslaw mix.  I also opted to lighten this up a bit by using Hellman's light mayo, reduced fat buttermilk, and 1% milk.  I poured everything into a large tupperware container and refrigerated for a few hours - definitely the longer the better!  Great side dish for bbq ribs!",
