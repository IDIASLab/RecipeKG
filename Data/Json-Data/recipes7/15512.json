I\u2019m on an elimination diet for BF, so dairy-free and gluten-free at the moment...used coconut oil (plus a little extra) in place of butter, and used almond milk. Also, used 1.5 tsp coffee grounds instead of cinnamon and cayenne because I wasn\u2019t looking for heat, just chocolate. They are a little dry, especially second day (stored in fridge). But frosting on top helps, and warming for 30 sec in the microwave makes a big difference. Will make again, thank you!!",

Exactly three Tbsp of batter per muffin (I used an ice cream scooper) and exactly 18 minutes in the oven. I followed the ingredients perfectly. I sifted the dry ingredients twice before adding to the butter/sugar mixture. Next time I'll add an extra egg. My husband thought they were too spicy but I thought they were fine. I'm even considering adding a pinch more cayenne next time. If you don't care for things too spicy I suggest you reduce the amount written. Thank you for the recipe.",
