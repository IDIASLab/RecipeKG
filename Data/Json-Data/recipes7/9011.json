I used to go to a Brazilian restaurant that sold a very similar cake with ice cream. It is to die for. The only change I made was omitting the coffee the second time I made it, as it is a little strong for my children.  I received so many compliments about how good this cake taste. They are very susceptible to breaking when unmolding, so I now make it in souffl\u00e9 cups and they look and taste great",

That will make the difference between eggy/rubbery results vs the divine cake that whipped eggs makes.  Yes, using high quality chocolate is preferred but I usually don't have that on hand. I used about 6 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips, melted in the microwave with the butter for two 20 second intervals.  I have tried other \"molten lava cakes\" from this site and this is by far the best one, in my opinion.",
