My thought was EWWWW) and finding that I love it in ice cream as much as I do on nachos or in burritos, I was excited to see a recipe that seemed like it would simulate the taste I loved there.\n\nThis recipe, alas, is not it. The taste is similar, nice and smooth and decent avocado taste, but it is WAY too sweet for my taste. The version I had at the restaurant is very mildly sweet, which I much preferred. It seemed as if the taste of the avocados came through more at the restaurant too, which makes me think it was even a bit too sweet to allow the full flavor of the avocados to show through. It was good enough that I will try it again, with much less sweetener next time. I'm thinking probably 1/2-3/4 cup sweetener instead of the 1 cup this recipe suggests. But other than that, it was very good. And if you prefer very sweet ice cream, it may be perfect for you as is. But not for me.",
