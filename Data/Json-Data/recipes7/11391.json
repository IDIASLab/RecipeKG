I followed the recipe but exchanged the margarine for butter for both the cake and topping. I eliminated the apples and just used the rhubarb. As others suggested I used a 9 x 12 pan and it came out perfectly. It was really good. I was somewhat hesitant about using the oats in the topping but it added a wonderful texture as well as flavour.

The photo looks like more of a bar type dessert than a cake which I believe you would get in the larger pan.
