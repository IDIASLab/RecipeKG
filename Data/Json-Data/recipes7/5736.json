I mix over a slow heat untilthe sugar is dissolved then bring it to a boil then IMMEDIATELY remove it as soon as it starts boiling... from the heat and spoon out on wax paper. We have been using this recipe for years and it is great. I also use 1 cup of pecan pieces too.",

Place sugar cocoa powder butter peanut butter and milk(I like evap milk) into saucepan. Over medium heat cook and stir until smooth and liquid. Let it come to a boil now here is the trick let boil without stirring for 2 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla and oat mixture then continue with recipe. Hope this helps those who have problems with this recipe setting up.",

The flavor is good but follwing these directions you would never be able to roll them into a ball. The \"dough\" is much too wet for that. I think the sugar mixture should have cooked longer to stiffen these up a bit. Next time I will leave the peanut butter out of the coconut/oat mixture and add it along with the vanilla to the cooked sugar/cocoa mixture (after letting it boil for a few minutes) then add that mixture to the oats. I think this will yield a firmer cookie that will set up better. I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.",
