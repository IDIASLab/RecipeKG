The ingredients are so simple that the only thing that could give the loaf an off taste would be the graham crackers themselves; maybe hers were old or she used a sausage instead of ground pork..",

The reason I gave only four stars is because the sauce was very runny and I think the loaf itself could use some more seasoning. It had good flavor and my 4-year-old loved it. There are 2 things that I will do differently next time. First I formed the loaf into a sourdough-type shape and next time I will make it more of a bread-loaf shape to hold in some moisture. The edges just got a little dry. Second I will not add as much water & vinegar to the sauce; maybe only half the amount. That way the sauce will not run off of my loaf and burn onto the parchment which is what happened this time. I prefer more of a thick-gravy one that would stick on the loaf and get nice and gooey. Overall I will definitely make this again but maybe add some additional herbs or fine-cut veggies to the loaf to suit our tastes. Thank you for the recipe!",
