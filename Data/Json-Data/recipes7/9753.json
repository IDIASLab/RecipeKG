I used vanilla flavored dairy free cashew ice cream I made in my Vitamix the day before unsweetened almond milk for the dairy milk and a packet of raw Truvia for the granulated sugar. I kept all ingredient amounts exactly the same for 1 serving of the recipe. Also I only had frozen blueberries and bananas so that is what I used. My Vitamix blender blends frozen fruit no problem so I always have a ton on hand. It probably just made a it a little thicker until it melted some. I wish I could have taken a picture but I drank it too fast! Nice flavor.",
