They were solid balls of dough not the fluffy donut-like consistency I associate with aebskivers. Using whole wheat flour sounds like a great idea because it will make it healthy but I don't think it's worth it... These have lots of butter and sugar in them anyways so they're not going to be a health food... Perhaps a Better and much tastier option is being sure to serve them with lots of fruit on the side. I don't recommend this recipe at least not with whole wheat flour.",
