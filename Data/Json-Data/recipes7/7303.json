I used Turkey Kielbasa, and added quartered red potatoes (so I only used 3 white potatoes), one and a half large onions in wedges, and because my garden is full right now, I added a red pepper, a green pepper, rosemary, basil, thyme, and large chunks of zucchini. I followed another reviewer's recommendation and tossed it all in a bowl with some olive oil, kosher salt, and cracked pepper first. I roasted it all covered at 375 for 30 minutes, and then at 400 for 10 minutes just to reduce all the juices a bit. My whole (picky!) family loved it!",

The potatos used are pretty important. I strongly recommend using Yukon potatos. I also chopped up a huge Spanish onion, 5 cloves of garlic (instead of 4), and added parsely. I love Kielbasa but sometimes I use a family-pack size ring of fresh sausage from a local supermaket. I was too lazy to put in carrots (don't like them anyway). Bakes fabulously at suggested settings in the recipe. I bake this every two weeks since it makes enough food for me to take to work for 3 days.",

                "reviewBody": "After reading all of the reviews I decided to put my own little twist on this. I adjusted the recipe to feed 3 people. If you love onions chop them into nice larger pieces and use a little more than 1/2 of one. Also I sliced the Kielbasa in 1/2 before cutting the 2-in. pieces. I threw everything in a mixing bowl first to make sure I could stir all of the seasoning as evenly as possible. I chopped a bit of fresh parsley and added paprika with the salt and pepper. After I poured the ingredients into the 9x13 baking dish I measured out the olive oil into a small bowl and added honey and balsamic vinegar. Obviously that makes for more sauce so I don't suggest initially coating the bottom of the dish with olive oil because ours was a bit too saturated at the end. That said this came out so delicious and I'm not even that big of a fan of sausage!",
