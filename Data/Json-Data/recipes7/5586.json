The fish/veggie mixture is loose and wet and I was not able to form cakes with it. I ended up throwing in the cornflake/bread crumb  mixture into it and that worked like a charm. After frying the first batch I felt they lacked a little something so I added some Old Bay to the 2nd batch before frying and that really added some depth.",
