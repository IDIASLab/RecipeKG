I didn't really measure / weigh the berries, but had them cover the bottom of the pan. The family, young and old, all loved this as a dessert, still warm, along with ice cream. We will be making this again, trying other fresh, soft seasonal fruit.",

Asked to pick blackberries and \"make something.\" Followed the directions exactly and turned out great. Not too sweet, which means whipped cream or ice cream works well. My husband thought it was a bit chewy but that is the texture and found the seeds annoying but that's blackberries for you. My oven runs hot so check 5 minutes or so before recommended times. Good lesson too in reading through the instructions, assembling all your ingredients and tools.",
