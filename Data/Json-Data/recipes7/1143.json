Secondly I don\u2019t know where others get their cube steak but the cube steak I get is slashed up with the mechanical tenderizer but NEVER seems to be that tender. Recipes that call only for breading it, browning it, then pour gravy over it, always leave me with nothing but a tough, breaded piece of meat with gravy on top. (Our cube steak isn\u2019t that cheap to waste on poor cooking either.) I live in the South where people make Country Fried Steak all the time. The best, most tender, (homemade) versions of the dish that I\u2019ve had are ALWAYS simmered in the gravy like this recipe. I\u2019ve simmered before too but still it was not \u201cmelt in your mouth\u201d tender and kind of bland. I was intrigued to try this recipe with the smaller pieces of steak trick to see if it helped. It does immensely! I pretty much went by the recipe. I cut my steak into strips. Also the onion soup is a nice rich starter flavor instead of just plain meat gravy from drippings only. The smaller pieces tend to soak up more of the gravy flavor than the big steak size pieces too. I saut\u00e9ed some fresh onions and some canned mushrooms to add to the gravy and give it a little more home cookin\u2019 restaurant quality depth. I simmered this for closer to two hours on very low heat, stirring and adding water as needed. Very tasty and tender. From now on this is MY Country Style Steak too.",

This recipe did an excellent job of rendering my elderly cube steaks palatable.  I just chopped off the freezer burned part and gave it to the neighbor's dog. (He's still alive so far.) The only thing I did different was to deglaze the pan with a little two-buck chuck Cabernet Savignon before adding the onion soup mix.  And I threw in a blob of minced garlic.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and substituted one cup of milk (I only had fat-free) for one cup of the water.  This was absolutely delicious served with garlic mashed potatoes and Smothered Green Beans from this site.",

I also left the cube steaks whole since I had some extra time to let them simmer longer.  After reading other's reviewers comments I decided to make a little extra gravy for the potatoes, so, I used 1-1/2 tbs of flour and 1-1/2 packs of onion soup mix.   After browning I used just a little red wine to deglaze the pan and add a little richness.  We like our gravy a little creamier - so I used about 1-1/2 cups of water and 1 cup of 2% milk (what we had). If you like a brown gravy - stick with the water.   I did not add any additional salt or garlic salt since I knew the onion soup mix was very salty on its own.  After whisking together to make the gravy I added the steaks back, covered them and let them simmer for about 1-1/2 hours.  I then took the lid off and let them simmer for another 1/2 hour to help thicken the sauce.  If the gravy is too thin you can remove the steaks, turn the heat up and add a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken.  Mine was a good consistancy though so I didn't need it this time.  The meat was fork tender and had good flavor. The gravy was still a little salty to me, but, my husband really liked it.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and baby peas.  It was good comfort food on a chilly night and different way to make cube steak other than country fried steak with white gravy that has a lot more fat.",
