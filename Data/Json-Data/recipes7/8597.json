This turned out OK when I followed the recipe but after one bite it didn't taste like apples to me at all. I felt like the lemon juice needed to be increased as it's what really makes it have that \"apple\" taste. The spices and topping were right on though. The main problem was I used a large garden zucchini (like the recipe submitter described) and they can have some softer middles with larger seeds. The seeds were a bit of a turn off for me. I tried it again and cut out the soft middle with the seeds sliced the pieces thinly this time and increased the lemon juice by an overflowing tablespoon. I still knew it wasn't apples but it was more enjoyable for me this way. It was good especially with some Cool Whip on it and I'll probably make it again next year with my changes.",

I also increased the lemon juice to 2/3 C and the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I used the food processor to make the topping, just pulsing it all until it got crumbly.  I needed to bake it a little longer as well - an hour did the trick.\nUPDATE:  I made 1/2 the recipe and baked in a 9X9 baking pan.  I also  added flour to the zucchini along with more sugar and lemon juice.  I may not have cooked it long enough, although It was in the oven for 1 hr 10 minutes, as the zucchini was still crunchy.  Not a fan.",
