Just a tip if you don't have a candy thermometer: Take a small bowl and fill with cold water. Drop tiny bits of the fudgey liquid into the bowl. When it balls up and stays together it is done cooking. If it becomes brittle and breaks apart it is overdone. If it just stays the same consistency it is NOT done and needs to be cooked longer.",
