Also, I sliced the meat considerably thinner than the 1/2\u201d the recipe directed. (Freezing the meat briefly, 20-30 minutes, makes this much easier. As for the preparation, I did that a little differently.  I cooked the meat first, set it aside, and then cooked the onions and red, yellow and green peppers, combining it all at the end.  I certainly didn\u2019t want to take a chance of overcooking the meat.  We did enjoy this, but I think it would benefit by the addition of garlic and, in my opinion, by the omission of the tomatoes.  What I particularly liked about this dish was its flexibility (add or use any meat and stir-fry appropriate vegetables you like), the fact that  we generally have the ingredients readily at hand to prepare it, and that it\u2019s nutritionally sound.",
