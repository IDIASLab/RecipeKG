Lepinja is a traditional \"bread\" served with chevapcici, which is a minced sheep meat or beef meat (never pork) and it's origin is in Bosnia.  Submitter has the ingredients right and has described the making process very well. However, you need to preheat your oven to as high as it will go prior to putting lepinja's in. Also, separate dough into flat rounds. You can make a ball and flatten it... Very hot oven will make the lepinja \"split\" and puff in the middle, making it easy to cut it open.",

I let it rise about 45 minutes & baked as directed. When it cooled we were able to cut it into 4 inch squares & carefully split it apart. It makes great pita like pockets or sandwich thins. Today we are splitting the whole thing for a pizza crust. Thank you for the great idea. =.. =",

Hope where you live there are Croatian food stores, because here in Canada they carry seasonigs for chevapi and recipe is on the back. It's for 2 1/3 lb of pork or beef, sometimes I mix both kinds together add 1egg, some 1/2 and 1/2 cream, 1/4 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs and mix it  all together by hand by kneading it gently until it forms a not to firm ball. Let it reast for about 1h in a fridge, take it out and take a handfull of mixture and form littel sausage roll, continue till all mixture is used up, BBQ. If you can't get seasoning mix; buy fine garlic powder, sea salt and finely ground black pepper and mix it, aproximatly 1/3 of each. Use 1 oz of mix for as above. Good luck.",
