I was looking for a recipe that did not require me to run to the store for MORE ingredients. Luckily I found this - the only thing was I had only STRAWBERRY Preserves... which ended up being PERFECT! My husband and Santa have put in a request for guava paste next time... They were perfect and I chose to use my cookie cutters so we had stars candy canes snowflakes and tree shaped cookies and it was just perfect... GREAT recipe! (oh and since I didn't have a rolling pin - I used a wine bottle) - SO ANYONE can make this!",

                "reviewBody": "This was not an easy recipe to make. I had calculator figure ingredients for 24 cookies. Had trouble figuring how many TBSP of butter equaled 2/3 cup. Finally settled on 12 TBSP. Measurement for cream cheese was a bit confusing. In original recipe of 18 cookies ellenz used \"1/2 (8 oz) pkg. Twenty-four cookies called for 2/3 (8 oz) pkg. I used 10 oz which may have been more than called for. Had a lot of cream cheese and butter with 1-1/3 cups flour. Took a long time to work into pea size. Rolling dough was a good exercise workout trust me. Was going to use 2-1/2 inch wide heart cutout but knew there would not be enough 1/8 inch thick dough so settled on 2 inch wide. Near impossible to put 1 tsp preserves on cookie so ended up using about 1/4 tsp. Dough was so small sealing cookie with fork almost destroyed heart-shapes. After brushing with beaten egg I sprinkled 17 cookies with brown sugar/sugar mixture. Baked light brown after 13 minutes. Watching a video to make this recipe would be a deciding factor to try making these again. Without it I will chalk this experience up as a challenge that didn't work. Sorry I couldn't rate this with a higher score.",

I scaled to 23 servings as I only had 5 oz butter. I weigh my dry ingredients after making the cookie dough it was so soft I had to add 8 tbsps of additional flour. I also added 2 tbsps sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. When I cut out the first tray of hearts I put them in the freezer with the dough scraps for about 10 minutes then I rolled the second batch of hearts and placed them in the freezer while I was filling/crimping the first tray. I cooked down my homemade apricot jam the night before to thicken it so it would not be so runny. I used my medium heart cutter which yielded 15 sandwiches that baked in 17 minutes on parchment lined sheets. I thought I had some coarse sugar but was mistaken so I just made a fast vanilla glaze to smear over the tops once cool. The pastry was light and flaky a favourite with my family!",
