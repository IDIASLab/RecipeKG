I seared both sides of the pork in a hot skillet then finished cooking them in the oven (at 400) for about 15 minutes. I find this leaves them very moist. Also I breaded them and refrigerated for an hour before I cooked them I think this helps the coating to stay on better. My kids loved the chops too.",

I didn't add the traditional breading method of flouring and dipping in egg wash for two reasons. The first of which is that I wanted the cleanest flavors possible and to not have the breading be to heavy (adding eggs and flour not only makes the breading thicker but they also add flavor) Secondly the meat itself is sufficiently moist enough to hold the coating if pressed into the meat. Also please note that the pan MUST be hot. If the pan and oil are not hot then the coating will absorb the oil helping for the breading to separate and the breading is likely to stick to the pan. I hope this information is helpful for future people making the recipe. Drew",

My kids are squabbling about who is taking the leftovers for lunch to work (I hit a sale on pork chops so I made nine). I could not find pumpkin puree at the grocery (apparently it's seasonal or else no one cooks with it anymore) so I used pumpkin pie filling omitted all the spices and sugar and just used the apple juice. Also because I wanted the breading to really stick I dipped the chops in beaten egg. Yum lots of thumbs up at my house. Thanks for making me look good!",
