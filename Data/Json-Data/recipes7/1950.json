The secret is to follow the instructions carefully-let the rice sit/dry completely etc. (do not mess with it too much)  ALSO: When adding the rice vinegar mixture do not mix it in but kneed with very few strokes just until combined so the rice grains keep their integrity and do not become soft and paste like. I highly recommend this recipe...thank you for posting!",

It doesn't say in the written instructions how much water to add to the rice, and because I knew it would be 5 cups yield, I filled my regular saucepan up to the top with water. Well, I wasted nearly half a bag of rice. It's is so gluggy and disgusting. Too much water. It would be great if the recipe could be altered to say, \"then place into a saucepan along with the konbu and 3 CUPS of water\" if this is the case and you only need 3 cups. As someone who has never made sushi rice before, I have absolutely no idea if this is what you do so any help would be very much appreciated.",

As with all sushi rice, make sure you have a bit of vinegar/water mix to wet your fingers so the rice doesn't stick and make a mess!  This mix is also great to wet your knife before slicing your sushi so it cuts through nice and clean.  Overall great recipe!",
