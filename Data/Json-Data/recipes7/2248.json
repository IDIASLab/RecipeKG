The triple sec can overwhelm the drink but the rhubarb flavor really shined through when we traded the triple sec for another tablespoon of rhubarb syrup and garnished with an orange peel twist. If you like it a little less sweet try adding a dash or two of Angostura orange bitters. The syrup is great over ice cream and pancakes as well.",
