If you find your tomatoes to be juicy drain the juice off before adding the tomatoes to the pot. The more juice you add to the jam the more watery the result will be. The first time I made this recipe my jam was a bit more like a sweet spicy sauce - never watery but just more saucy. So don't give up. If you liked the flavor try again with firm meaty tomatoes.",
