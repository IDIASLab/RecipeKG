Instead of buying strawberry extract I used 1 tsp. vanilla in the bread batter and in the glaze I used about 1/2 tsp. vanilla plus a few drops of orange extract. I also use granulated sugar instead of flour whenever greasing the pans for quick breads. It makes a sweet little crust on the underside that is much more appealing than flour residue. Loved the recipe - will definitely make it again.",

I found that it made the bread have a clammy texture because we didn't eat the two loaves right away.",

We started out baking 4 loaves and had a real problem. We took them out of the oven after 45 minutes and the toothpick came out clean. However within 5 minutes all 4 loaves had fallen. They weren't done. The toothpick came out clean because there was a space under the crust. I talked with my father-in-law who was a baker for 60 years and he told me to bake it for 55 minutes at 375 degrees. We made two more loaves and this was much closer to the cook time. He said it was because the strawberries while thawed were still cold and made the batter cold increasing the bake time. After all the work the bread was good but just 3 stars in our book.",
