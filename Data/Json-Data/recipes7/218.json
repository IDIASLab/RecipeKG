I took tips from other users and floured the meat before browning it and also added extra corn starch. I don't think it has too much wine but I do think it should cook longer than 4-6 hours for maximum flavor. Be sure to use a good meat too! Also I couldn't find consomme so to get that intense flavor I added an extra can of beef stock (using a bit less water) and then threw in a boullion cube. Next time I will use more carrots and more potatoes and add a little Worchesthire sauce which I didn't have on hand though I did use some balsamic vinegar. On the whole though this is a good classic stew and very very easy.",

I cooked the stew in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours but thought it could have stood another hour or two to further tenderize the meat. After it was done cooking last night I didn't think that the flavors married that well and all I could taste was wine and thyme. But a night in the frig mingled the flavors and evened out the thyme and wine flavors. Heated the whole thing up on the stove when I got home and added in the corn starch...yep it needed more than what the recipe calls for. Always nice to have dinner ready (or almost so) right after work! One last comment...We ate half of the stew (froze the rest) and it fed 3 of us which included 2 adults and a 3 year old. So I think that the serving size is off or at least for how much this family eats. Anyway thanks for the nice recipe; it'll probably be a winter staple for us.",
