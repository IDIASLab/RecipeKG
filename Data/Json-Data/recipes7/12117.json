I doubled the recipe added an extra banana substituted half of the flour with almond flour reduced the sugar by a third and substituted half the coconut oil with butter. All in all the recipe is very similar and I am sure would be great as written as well. I cannot wait to make another batch when my next set of persimmons ripen!",

I Would have love to double the recipe if I would have had extra ingredients. The reason for making this recipe for me was to try persimmon I had never used persimmon or had ever tasted one I wanted to learn about them. I let the persimmon ripe for about a week and when I went to peel the persimmon I noticed it had a feel black spots and then the rest was hard not easy to mash I was not sure if the Persimmon was good or not but I carried on making the muffins. I didn't read all the steps first before making the muffins and I add all the ingredients in the first step together without mixing before adding the next ingredient. The first thing I noticed was the big chunks of persimmon and the coconut oil hardening. but I left them like that I thought maybe the would taste good like that..After mixing all the ingredients and pouring into prepared muffins cups the batter ended up making 9 muffins I don't know whether this was because of the chunks persimmons but i had to use a turkey baster to get all the water out of each extra muffin cup until I used up all the batter. Into the oven they went. I will let you know how they taste as soon as they cool",
