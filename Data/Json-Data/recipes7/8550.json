I actually made a second batch wondering if the first great batch had been a lucky \"fluke\"..but Nope! the second batch was just as good and with very little time involved! Be sure to spray your mixing spoon or else the candy kinda clumps on the spoon while stirringThe candy also gets rock hard in the glass mixing bowl once it dries (which is IMMEDIATELY!)..But just soak the dish and spoons in GOT soapy water and it'll soften and wash right offs. Speaking as an amateur..this reciepe is really EASY! Good luck!",

Put butter on the cookie sheet and warm it in the oven until ready.  spread the butter all over the cookie sheet before you pour the brittle.

This is almost the same recipe.\n Follow another persons idea and butter the trays, keep warm in oven at 200 til you need it.\nAlso the corn syrup and sugar mix better if that bowl is warm too... Just wash it and have  it warm that way.\nI check it after the 3-4 mins, still and add another 1-2  mins so it WILL harden. Dont, if yours is getting too dark. \nAlso use good butter, a name brand... Others tend to scorch easier.\n Yumm... Making mine now!!",
