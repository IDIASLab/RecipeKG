If you like a sweeter salad - you would probably enjoy this recipe.",

I agree with the posters; the flavor was bland. I added garlic powder. Boom! that's all it needed. It is now a tasty salad. I will add green beans tonight. Before we finish it off I will add a lesser amount of corn to see if I like the addition. Enjoy!",
