I did replace the 6 TB of sugar with 4 TB of Stevia and it worked well for our tastes.  This could easily become a main dish meal by adding grilled chicken or shrimp.  I served this with 'Sweet and Spicy Grilled Shrimp' and 'Stuffed Pea Pods', both from AR.  Thanks, Shalvie for sharing your recipe.",
