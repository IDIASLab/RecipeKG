The main difference in the way it was written was that it was not chilled but only allowed to come to room temperature. I have found by experimenting that you can speed up the first step a great deal by including part of the butter right away following the procedure you'd use for a basic white sauce. The outcome is the same and you don't have to stand and stir nearly as long. Look up basic white sauce recipes to see what I mean. This is an amazing frosting almost like whipped cream but gets hard in the refrigerator. Bring to room temp to serve.",
