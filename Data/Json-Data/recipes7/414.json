I made this in a 2.5 qt casserole dish, with approximately 2x the ingredients. The only reason I adjusted anything was because I had a 12oz can of pumpkin, which is 2 cups, and wanted to use it all. Therefore, I used \"about\" 2x everything, making it a little more pumpkiny, and with slightly less sugar and milk, and 1 less egg yolk. Finally, I tried raisins instead of chocolate chips, and mixed them into the batter. It was truly fantastic. I look forward to further adjusting this to suit my family's taste in the future, and I plan on making it for the holidays this year. Note: I'm at a high altitude, and I didn't have any problems with this at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.",

I also took a frosting recipe from a cinnamon roll recipe and spread it over the pudding fresh out of the oven and sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top. I omitted the chocolate chips.

I am hosting Thanksgiving for about 20 people this year so since it's the end of September my husband & I thought we should start thinking about what we will serve and test out some recipes before we serve anything new. I made a few adjustments...I used a regular casserole dish instead of individual ramekins. Also did not use cloves at all and instead of whole milk I had a container of half and half to use up. Very good! When I make it in a casserole dish again I will double the recipe. Also instead of chocolate chips I added some of the little Heath bar toffee bits to the top. Hubby ate almost half the dish last night with some Reddi-whip on top. Neither of us is a huge pumpkin lover but this was very good.",
