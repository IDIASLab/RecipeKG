The recipe was well received and the cookies disappeared fast...but a few things of note of the recipe as written... the glaze is not a glaze it's icing. it is way way to thick to drizzle on anything nor did it harden. I didn't do any of the fancy decorating just good cookies and tasty icing was fine with us",
