It\u2019s been outrageously hot so the topping turned into more of a mushy texture even when browned, and the flavor of the topping was too strong. I think I\u2019d definitely do a different kind of topping and add the cinnamon and ginger to the fruit which I\u2019ll precook on the stove to make a more cohesive filling. The flavors are amazing, I think next time I\u2019ll try it with plums, more raspberries, cherries, and maybe blackberries or another tart fruit. I also sprinkled the fruit with a little cornstarch to thicken the juices into a sauce, which I definitely recommend if you don\u2019t want to wait an extra 30 min of cooking for it to thicken on its own. \nAll in all not a bad recipe, just needs personal adjustments.",

                "reviewBody": "This has great fruit flavor but the topping was too much in my opinion. A good portion of it sank and mixed into the fruit juices which gave everything a weird texture. I think halving the amount of topping might help that part. I also had to bake mine at least an extra 25-30 minutes to get the fruit cooked down and not be soupy and to get the top browned. Part of that was my fault as I realized too late that I used a Pyrex baking dish which is not broiler safe. So make sure you use a broiler safe pan so you can properly brown the topping. I also felt it could use less sugar and more raspberries but that's personal preference. I would make again as I really enjoy the plum/nectarine/raspberry flavor combination but I would definitely make a few adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!",
