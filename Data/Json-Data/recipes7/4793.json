I was a little skeptical because of the simplicity of the ingredients and becuase the dough turned out very soft and buttery. I baked them until golden around the edges and they turned out really good. Just a delicious simple cookie nothing extravagant. Just a note the dough doesn't seem to spread much during baking so you want to flatten them before baking. Also I used a little more than 1.5 cups of potatoe chips and it turned out fine (I didnt want to throw away any leftovers from the bags).",
