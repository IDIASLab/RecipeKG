We froze it to get it harder, but it never went rock hard, like most homemade ice creams get in the freezer, which is a huge plus. And I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it!",

I added a dash (1/4 teaspoon) of salt to bring out the flavors.  Used organic whipping cream and used organic half & half instead of plain milk along with farm eggs.  The final texture and flavor was so close to store bought without the chemicals and preservatives.  This ice cream base is the best one I've ever used.  I plan on using this base from now on for any homemade ice cream.  It's one that never got \"crunchy-hard\" in the freeze the way other homemade ice cream can get.",
