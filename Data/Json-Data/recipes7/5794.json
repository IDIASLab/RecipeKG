Might have something to do with me not really liking Green Beans. I thought the texture from roasting them was off and if I must have green beans I prefer them with a lot of crunch. These seems more tough then crunchy to me.... but again like I said my wife daughter and son in law said they really liked them. The dill Vinaigrette was good and I might try that again on fresh quick blanched beans just for kicks.",
