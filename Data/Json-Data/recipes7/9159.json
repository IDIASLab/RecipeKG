And it's easy to change a little bit to accommodate your favorite flavors, like by using flavored coffee creamers, or different types of coffee. I like it because, unlike other recipes, it's dairy-free. It may have some unusual ingredients, but trust me, they're necessary to make it all bond together and have the great cooler texture.",

The oil did emulsify this amd give it a oooler texture. I am not sure what the point of the cooking spray vs more oil. Anyway I am glad I tried this as an experiement but this is not for me. The coffee creamer gave this a fake unnatural taste and I prefer the taste of real milk or almond milk in mine and the oil? While an interesting idea the idea I was drinking oil - well just didn't sit well with my morning coffee",
