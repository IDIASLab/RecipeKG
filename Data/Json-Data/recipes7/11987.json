                "reviewBody": "This is a nice recipe for \"canning\" apple butter, but, I feel additional information is needed.  If you are actually canning, the apple butter should be spooned into sterilized 1/2 pint or pint jars, leaving 1/2\" space from the top. Wipe the top and rim edge with a clean damp cloth and place sterilized lids and rings hand tightened on the jars.  Place these jars onto a rack in a boiling water bath. DO NOT PLACE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. There should be at least 1\" of boiling water covering the jars. If the water cools a bit when you add the jars, bring back to a slow rolling boil and process for 5 minutes below 6000 ft and 10 minutes above 6000 feet.  When removing from the water bath, the jar lids should suck down with a pop/ping sound when sealed.  Leave set on a clean towel away from drafts over night. The sealing process may not be immediate.  Press the center of the lids the next day to insure they sealed.  They should be solid.  If not, refrigerate the unsealed jar and use within a week.  If sealed, remove the ring, and wash the jars in hot soapy water, to insure any food that seeped out is removed and no bacteria will grow contaminating the sealed jar.  NOTE:  If the ring will not remove easily, place the jar upside down in the soapy water.  It will loosen and remove easily in a few minutes usually, if not...use this jar first.  Be sure to date the lid with a permanent marker.  HAPPY CANNING!",

I cooked the apples in a small slow cooker for 4 hours at low and then switched it to high for another 3.5 hours. I then pureed it with a hand held mixer and added the vanilla. Continued at low with lid off for another 1.5 hours. Totaling 9 hours. This was very easy and fun to make. The entire house smells delicious!",
