As I prefer less sweet I omitted the sugar triple sec and almond syrup. I put the grilled pineapple rum ice cubes and squeezed lime juice into a blender. Had this as a slushy and also tried it as a tall drink by adding lime sparkling water and quartered limes to the slushy mix. Loved the flavor and will make this again. As the rum is already mixed in any leftovers can be put in the freezer and it will remain in slushy form.",
