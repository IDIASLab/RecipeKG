I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for 1/4 cup of shortening but had problems with the bottom of the dessert being underbaked. It needed to be baked at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Also the meringue looked beautiful and puffy as it baked but when I took them out it shrunk down and pulled away from the side creating a rather ugly appearance. The one redeeming thing about this recipe is that it is tasty; like a giant chocolate chip cookie topped with meringue. With a few alterations this could be outstanding!",

A couple of tips: instead of stirring in the chocolate chips press them into the cookie dough before spreading on the meringue. After spreading on the meringue press parchment paper lightly onto the fluff so that it doesn't brown too quickly. Carefully peel it off 2/3 of the way through baking and continue baking to allow the meringue to crisp and brown. Allow to set overnight so that the meringue softens slightly and becomes chewy and splendid. YUMMMMM",
