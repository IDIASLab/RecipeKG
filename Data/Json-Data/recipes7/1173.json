So, I had to get my own measurements. These are pretty close, except I use about 3/4 cup of white sugar, or sometimes 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown. Also I use evaporated milk for a creamier pudding. Flour works fine if you are out of cornstarch. Also a few flaor enhancing spices....1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Best thing about this is that it's a \"dump\" recipe - mix in one bowl and bake slowly. Enjoy with a cup of coffee for breakfast too!!!",

I drained the corn and baked it all for 90 mins. but still watery. I drained the casserole and baked it a bit more and it was great. I also added a little bit of black pepper. Very good!",

I'd really like to give this 4 1/2 stars because it tastes delicious but I think it would be better in a round casserole dish (like in the picture) as opposed to the 9x13 mentioned in the recipe. The 9x13 made it too thin although it still took the same amount of time to bake. One other thing - it doesn't puff up like it says in the instructions. Overall very tasty!",
