I did as Linda (LMT) suggested and made a scaled back Apple Pie Filling by Terri to use in this recipe. It worked perfectly. The house smelled amazing while baking. We enjoyed it the first serving - warm. The second serving my family actually enjoyed this the next day for breakfast toasted. They cut it thin and popped it in the toaster. We enjoy banana bread orange bread plum bread etc. toasted and we all enjoyed this apple cake the same way. Tonight they ate it at room temp and they informed me that it is very good that way also. Thanks Allie for a delicious recipe. It works 2 ways in our house as a dessert and as a breakfast treat. It will be made again.",

I usually get a box of cake mix, but I thought I'd try to make a spice cake from scratch for her big day.\nSo, I tried this recipe: it was a huge hit!\nI varied a little from the recipe, however.  I used a can of organic apple pie filling that was just apples and water (I was a bit leery of using canned apple pie filling because of the additives), so I added some extra spice to the mixture to make up for the un-spiced apple filling:  allspice & ginger.\nIt turned out fantastic.  Don't be alarmed if the cake is a bit dark though. I really thought I had burned it but it tasted great. \nI also added a bit of cream cheese glaze (4 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla & 2 tblsp. of milk).\nThanks for the great recipe!\n\nNew notes:\nMy mom will be 84 this year & this is her favorite, so I have made this cake many times since her 80th birthday.  Over-baking this cake will make this cake very dark & kind of tough. So, only bake it until a toothpick comes out clean:  it's a light golden brown.\nSince I use apples packed in water, I am careful to drain the apples & chop them into smaller pieces before adding to the batter.  Once I used fresh apples that I cooked with a bit of butter & brown sugar.\nI cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups: 2 cups of sugar is too sweet.\nI top it with lemon cream frosting when I make cup cakes, or I thin the frosting into a glaze when I make it in a tube pan.
