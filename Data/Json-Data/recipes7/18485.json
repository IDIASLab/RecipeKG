                "reviewBody": "Update: I made this a second time, but blanched and peeled the tomatoes first. The jam looks better without tomato skins so peel them or chop your tomatoes to make smaller bits of skin in the final product. Also, I cooked mine in a large saucier pan. It cooks in less than 30 minutes, but don't walk away from it.  I think the flavor would benefit most by using expensive balsamic that is thick and syrupy. Mine wasn't and when combined with the lemon juice was a little too acidic. The fix was a squeeze of balsamic glaze. That took the edge off because it's a another hit of sugar. Also, I tend to use too much black pepper and did that on this second batch. I'm hoping the cheese will absorb the pepper bite.  This is delicious.   You will not be disappointed.  I have cherry tomatoes in the freezer and plan to make more jam this winter.",
