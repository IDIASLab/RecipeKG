You can add raisins, cranberries, nuts, cinnamon, chopped apples, flaxseed, wheat germ, etc. You can't mess up this recipe. Kids love it with the cup of sugar, but by adding less sugar and other ingredients you can make it healthy and also delicious by serving it with blueberries, strawberries, or peaches.",

To make it more healthy I used the flaxseed and applesauce, combined to make 1/2 cup, to substitute for the 1/2 cup oil.  Sugar was one cup.  This was much too sweet.  I changed it to 1/4 cup brown sugar with no white sugar.  The baking powder was 3/4 Tbsp. baking powder.  I always add the cinnamon to the batter as we like cinnamon.  Changing the ingredients made it heavier than the original, but this way it is full of healthy ingredients. Hope this clears up some of the ingredients written.  I never have trouble getting it out of the pan.  Just wondering why several did.  Adding chopped apple, raisins, nuts cranberries etc.  make it extra special.  So glad so many have enjoyed it.  If you make it in a 9x13 pan, freeze some and you can have a quick breakfast using your microwave.\n\n\n\nYou definitely need cinnamon.  Sorry I forgot to add it. \nOn my review I mentioned that I did not use any white sugar , only 1/4 cup brown sugar.   That should help as the fruit makes it sweet enough.",

They serve it at restaurants here, and it is always a dry block of flavorless oats that you have to put milk on. This recipe is moist - revelation! Baked oatmeal can be moist?! It tastes like banana bread, and while I did prefer it hot with milk, I ate it right out of the oven without milk and cold out of the fridge, too. It is delicious every way. I did use grape seed oil rather than flax seed as it is what I had on hand. I recommend cutting the brown sugar and baking powder together first so the powder isn't clumpy in the batter, but that's it! Excellent recipe!",

This was like banana bread meets dense, soft, moist sweetened oatmeal. It is really sweet, I will not deny that. As such, I would probably save this as a breakfast treat to make in the fall. I would at least try the recipe just as is, though, before altering it to ones diet. I tried it because it was recommended by an Allrecipes member. I did use safflower oil instead of flax oil and rolled oats as it did not say what type. Both worked well. For easy clean up I lined an 8x8 pan with 2 layers of foil sprayed with pan spray. When done, and almost cooled, I cut it in half and each half into 4 2\" pieces. I have no idea how this makes 9 servings. The pieces are very filling, served warm in a bowl, with milk. ty",

I served the kids theirs with milk since it was hot out of the oven but I packed some for work and it was fantastic on its own at room temperature. I imagine I'll be making this often. The changes I made were using I/4 cup less white sugar and coconut oil instead of flaxseed oil. I added a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.

I will keep decreasing the amount of white sugar I use until I find the least amount I can get by with and still get the kids to eat it.",

Next time I want to try canned pears or peaches (which I will blend before adding) but you can probably experiment with this. I didn't have flaxseed oil so I used canola. The second time I made it I left out the white sugar just added the brown thinking that if I wanted to I could sprinkle some sugar on it before eating. The addition of the 3/4 cup of white sugar makes it more cake-like IMO. One thing I would stress is spraying the pan before adding your mixture. I didn't do that the first time and it stuck to my non-stick pan. I don't get 9 servings out of it though I get 6 using an 8 x 8 pan. I also sprinkled some cinnamon on top before baking. When done I cut it into 6 portions and refrigerated it. I like it in the morning - just nuke it for a minute on 3/4 power. P.S. You can probably top it with some vanilla yogurt. Yum!",
