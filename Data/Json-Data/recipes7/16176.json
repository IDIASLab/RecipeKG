But who can have a cake without frosting? Not me! A creamy peanut butter cream cheese frosting tops this off and makes it my one-of-a-kind cake filled with four favorite flavors. I think Elvis would be proud!",

                "reviewBody": "I had several concerns about this recipe, number one being the method.  This recipe uses more of a quick bread method, than a cake method. I also questioned adding whole wheat flour to a cake, and using applesauce, instead of oil or butter.  However, I put my concerns aside and followed the instructions and ingredients, to a \"T\".  My only change was to cool the layers in the pans on a rack about 10 minutes, then turn the layers out onto the rack to cool completely.  Next, on to the frosting:  I used a traditional method for frosting, placing one layer on the cake stand, frost the layer, stack the next layer, then frost the top and sides.  However, when I looked at the proportions of ingredients for the frosting, I had to part company with the submitter, because I knew the recommended amounts would never stretch to cover a 2 layer cake.  So, I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 pound of confectioner's sugar, and 2 Tablespoons milk, and a pinch of salt, creamed together with an electric mixer.  This yielded enough frosting to do the cake.  The finished results were not really pleasing, and for the time and trouble of baking from scratch, I want a stellar recipe.  I could barely detect any chocolate flavor, and the cake was heavy and dense.  In a household of 3, I would expect to have cake leftover, so I did not use the sliced bananas on the top, choosing instead to garnish the plates.",
