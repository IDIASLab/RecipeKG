Here is a recipe for Irish soda bread that I have adapted over time for St. Patrick's Day.  The recipe calls for rice and tapioca flour instead of wheat and it still tastes yummy!  Good if wrapped and left overnight, but I think it tastes great right out of the oven. Serve with butter or jam.",

Also I had left over half-and-half so I added a tablespoon of vinegar to that and a little sour cream to make up the difference in the cup of buttermilk. This recipe did take 20 minutes less to bake but I don't think that is a negative. The outcome was delicious it was bread! The brown rice gave it a fun darker color.",

It is not the soft bread for making sandwiches so many of us long for. Next I will try some of the other gluten-free bread recipes on this site.",

I didn't have any buttermilk (or any kind of milk for that matter -- I'm dairy intolerant as well as gluten) so I added 2 tbs vinegar to some water to equal a cup. I also subbed out a half cup of rice flour for buckwheat flour and added 2 tbs milled flaxseed (10g) and probably about 1/4 c (10g) nutritional yeast to add some health to it. It is light airy and delicious -- thank you SO MUCH for this recipe! I almost cried. x)",
