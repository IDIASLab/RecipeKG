If it were a good recipe it would need to be refrigerated before separating into 3 logs. No matter, I did refrigerate it to firm it up, but the end result was throwing it away.\nThe \"logs\" looked like cement pancakes when I took them out of the oven. It didn't look like any mandel bread I've ever made.\nCutting it into pieces (if possible) would have looked like thin crackers!\nI can only assume any good reviews were meant for other mandel bread recipes on this site.\nSave yourself the expense, the trouble, the time and use another recipe.",
