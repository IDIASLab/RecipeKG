This recipe makes a lot so we are planning to take it for lunch for the next few days... taking the spinach/basil combo in a separate box from the rice and putting it together at lunch. I made this with tempeh instead of chicken but I think tofu would be great too. I used brown basmati rice and Thai basil. The peanut sauce is marvelous. This would be even better if topped with shredded carrots and chopped peanuts. My only problem with this recipe is the order that the ingredients are listed - it would be better if they were listed in order of use. Thanks Uncle Ben!",
