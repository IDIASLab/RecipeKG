        "description": "Khao man gai or khao mun gai, literally meaning oily rice [with] chicken, is one of the most popular Thai dishes; it can be found everywhere in Thailand from streetfood stalls to restaurants. It is originally from Hainan, China. In Thailand, khao man gai is served with cucumbers, chicken blood tofu, coriander, and a bowl of soup. The heart of khao man gai is the sauce! This recipe is a healthy version of khao man gai; I used less oil and chicken breasts instead of the parts of chicken with fat and skin. Enjoy!",
