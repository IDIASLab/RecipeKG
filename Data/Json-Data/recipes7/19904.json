The blueberry crisp turned out well and was enjoyed by everyone. I think this would be good with less sugar mixed in with the blueberries as I felt the sweetness overshadowed the flavor of the berries.  The topping turned out nice and crisp, perfect in my  opinion.  This would be wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!   We will make this recipe again.",

I tried making it with Walmart stevia/erythritol instead and added some almond flour to keep the dry ingredient ratio intact. I reduced the sweetness by about 50%, too.
