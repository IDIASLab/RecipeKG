Now, I didn't have the Neufchatel cheese, so I used the Philadelphia cream cheese with chive and onion. But while making the sauce, I also added a dash of basil. It tasted so delicious,that I'm on my second plate...... Oh and this is the very first time trying this recipe.",

I do think come summer time the chicken would be better grilled and then sliced and served over noodles - but it was fine when made as directed.  I did give the chicken a good rub of Cajun seasoning before cooking; I also added a sprinkling of dried red peppers, some parsley, and used 1 cup stock and 1/4 cup half & half as it was getting ready to expire.  I was worried the sauce was too thin, but it thickened up nicely after sitting a bit.  Thanks so much for recipe :)",

I was also surprised to see the recipe didn't call for any salt. Salt brings the flavors out in foods so I added about 1/2 tsp. which helped with the blandness. It was very easy to make and after the tweaking my family raved about it. I will definitely make it again with the additions.",
