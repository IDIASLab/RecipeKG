My only complaint is the topping, would almost have liked to pop it under the broiler, used to having struzel topping that is melted and crisped up a bit.",

I didnt have any brown sugar so I just skipped the 2nd part of the recipe all together. It wasnt bad! Still worth five stars. I never liked frosting so this turned out perfect. I wouldnt say it was on the rubbery side like one review stated. More like bouncey? Its a microwave cake what do you expect? I saved the other half of my egg cause im going to make another one later. Next time one of my kids has a sleep over im going to show this one off.",
