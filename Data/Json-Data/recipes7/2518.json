It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! Tonic water can be substituted instead of the soda water but the taste is different and somewhat bitter.",

We use simple syrup (equal parts sugar in the raw and water, boiled down) instead of granulated sugar because it mixes with more ease. We also just muddle one half of a lime with the mint (exactly 11 leaves), add ice, measure your rum (we use 2 ounces) and simple syrup, then shake that bad boy to death. Pour into a glass, and top with a splash of soda water. These are crazy popular at my bar. We also garnish these with a stick of sugar cane, but that is strictly for aesthetics. Annoying to make, but so good.",
