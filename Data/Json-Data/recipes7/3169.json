        "description": "This is called 'Middle-Eastern' fava bean stew and not 'Moroccan' because I have also borrowed flavors from my Lebanese roots. This stew came to me on a Saturday afternoon when we were desperately low on groceries and had no meat in the freezer. The first time my carnivorous partner tried it, he honestly thought it contained meat. I have made this many times, and he devours it with relish! To make this dish completely vegetarian/vegan, omit the anchovies. Serve with steamed basmati rice, couscous or bulgur.",

Since I don't like hot dishes I substituted peppercorns for the red pepper flakes as well. I also added some quorn chunks as I had them out to make another dish before I decided to use this recipe. It came out \"okay\" but not really so special and a bit over-tomatoey. Since we had enough left for the next meal I added spinach to it as well as paunchparum spices (a combination of fennel fenugreek corriander cumin and mustard seeds) roasted in some oil. And this time it was very yummy. I know that I've perhaps altered the dish beyond recognition but it did turn out fine and I'll probably do it again.",

I used a seeded acorn squash and left the skin on for color. I cooked the stew for the recommended 90 minutes and everything was very tender and yummy but I kept the pan covered. My stew would have been too dry had I cooked for 90 minutes uncovered. The consistency was perfect over GABA brown rice! Definitely a keeper recipe! Thank you!",
