I was concerned because my dough wasn't particularly sticky - moderately stiff and elastic - but, although it was difficult to roll out they turned out just fine.  I did use about half of the salt in the dough since I felt the additional salt on top would make them salty enough.  I poked holes in half the recipe, but didn't dock the other half and could see no difference.  I baked them for about 15 minutes, removing the ones that were done earlier and putting the others back until all were a nice golden brown.  They were excellent accompanying the Sun-Dried Tomato Tapenade from Alexis May Tanner (itself an awesome recipe that I might now have to review!)",

I followed the basic recipe, including parmesan, but did not have rosemary or any other fresh herbs so I used dried dill. Tasted great! Also, first batch wasn't quite thin enough - they're still tasty and somewhat crunchy, but I wanted more snap - so I made sure to roll second batch thinner. This will be my go to recipe, trying new flavors always, and will probably never get store bought again. PS Loved the video! :-)",

                "reviewBody": "Certainly the key here is roll them out thinly but you've got to be careful about over-baking. The taste isn't pleasant. In the video, Chef John returns half the tray to the oven to get the remaining pieces equally brown. I did that with a few but in the end, I prefer the look of the variation in colour .  They look very presentable in the serving bowl and all the crackers are quite crispy.  I had only half the amount of fresh Rosemary and though I'm not so keen on a strong Rosemary taste, these do need the full amount.  Also, I think next time I might pulse the salt a bit to make the bits smaller - to make for a lighter and more even distribution of the salt. Lastly, these can be placed very close to each other on the baking tray - they don't expand.",
