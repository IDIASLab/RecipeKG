Moist lightly chocolate and more cake-like just as the submitter describes. Still I have a few criticisms that wouldn't allow me to rate them higher. First there are holes in the cake which in my view is not pretty whether it affects taste or not. My fault possibly but I generally don't have that problem. Second the preparation requires a little more monkeying around with than it needs to and could easily be simplified. Finally there is just nothing uniquely special or stand-out about them to distinguish them from other similar recipes. Good but not memorable.",
