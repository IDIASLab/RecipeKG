I added a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mix and since plain bread crumbs were not specified I used Italian and added the spices listed. I also spray with pam olive oil spray. The egg wash didn't look to be nearly enough but it was perfect. My recommendation is to use fresh not frozen ravioli and maybe brush EVOO on or add a bit to the egg wash so its not so dry. Lastly I highly recommend turning your ravioli on the rack half way through. The underside was still a bit soft and undone with the top was perfectly browned.",

I dipped in flour first, washed with a whole egg (didn't want to waste the yolk), then dunked in the crumbs (I used Italian seasoning and garlic salt in place of the basil and whatever else it called for), then sprayed with the cooking spray. This made for a nice, crispy coating and I still felt better eating them since they weren't fried (hey, you gotta save the calories where you can)! I think turning the ravioli would be much more trouble than it's worth and I would not recommend doing so. For dipping, I made an alfredo sauce and a pizza sauce and sprinkled everything with fresh parsley and parmesan. Fantastic! Thank you for submitting this recipe chefspecialty.",

I think all the reviews said they tended to taste rather bland so I raided my new erb garden and added everything not nailed down. basil oregano thyme sage rosemary cilantro onion and garlic powder and a healthy amount of Parmasaen cheese We liked them. Next time I will adjust the heat because at the 15 minute mark they were pretty crispy. I made a second batch and shortened the cooking time and they were much better. Mine were not frozen maybe that makes a difference. We will definitely have these again. I would like to get a more Italian taste to them next time. We didn't worry about sauce we just used the pasta sauce.",

Thank you chefspecialty for the awesome recipe! The only changes I made were panko (didn't have bread crumbs) and baked mine on a foil-lined cookie sheet because I did not have a rack to put over. Mine were nicely browned and crunchy. I set the timer for 15 mins to check and just kept resetting and checking every 3 to 5 mins. until the right golden brown. I made homemade spaghetti sauce as a dip and truly enjoyed this pre SuperBowl. Next time, I plan to add garlic powder to the breading but I will not make any other changes. Now to hit rate instead of cancel.... :)",
