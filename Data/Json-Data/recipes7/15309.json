It is an interesting concept and if I have some shrimp left at some point I will try this again but with the lime. It was worth a try to make this one! Thanks McCormick!",

I think the popular consensus was that the sour cream/cream cheese layer needed some sort of seasoning added to it. As it was because of the avocado and the suspicion that it wouldn't keep very well we wound up throwing a lot of it away at the end of the night.",

I was excited about the ingredients but I used the tequila and that definitely made a difference for me not liking it as much. It took away the fresh flavor. I added diced celery because I love a shrimp cocktail with celery and that was a good addition. I ll cut the dairy down by half and use only lime juice next time. I thought everyone would LOVE the shrimp dish as I was generous with the shrimp but it just wasn t the big hit. But will try it again with the changes and see what happens.",

I decided to use the lime juice instead of the Tequila based on what I read on previews reviews I also decided to add a little bit of red onion and cilantro as I thought these ingredients were going to enhance the flavor of the dip. The flavors are great but I give it 4 stars because in my opinion the amount of cheese and cream mix is far too much. We ate the dip with pita chips.I had never tried the McCormick guacamole seasoning and its really good. I will make this again and cut the cheese and cream in half.",
