This was my first time making a cake and I was very delighted with the result. A couple of things: I thought the icing was a little too sweet even though I didn't use all of the icing I made. I did end up cutting the amount of sugar in the cake by a 1/4 cup. (I thought this was just right) After reading one of the reviews I decided to put the butter/coffee mixture in an ice bath for it to cool until the butter began to solidify again (i'm not sure what the purpose of this was). The baking time however was almost twice as long. I checked it periodically and took it out of the oven when the toothpick came clean. Nonetheless people were impressed.",

There's far too much liquid and not enough binding agents to get this cake to actually turn out. I baked this cake for 90 minutes in a large springform pan and it still wasn't fully cooked. The outer edge was baked enough that we could try it and it does taste good. It just really needs an ingredient adjustment.",

I did not do this, and my completed batter was liquid, so in my alarm I added half a cup of flour. I was surprised when the cake actually baked through in 50 minutes (n a bundt pan). It was a tasty cake, but it was quite heavy with a stodgy middle. Maybe this was because I'd added the extra flour. My only other variation was substituting yoghurt for buttermilk. Pity.
