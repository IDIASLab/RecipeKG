Also make sure your baking soda is FRESH. I did add a couple of my favorite ingredients and it turned out oh so good. I used a 50/50 mix of white sugar & brown sugar. I added an extra banana, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of walnuts. I also find a glass loaf pan works best. Before baking I sprinkled more chopped walnuts and brown sugar on top. I baked for a total of 70 min at 325 and covered with foil for the last 30 min so it wouldn't brown too much. Yum!!",

It is especially good toasted with butter because the outside gets crunchy.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Joy!",

(I covered the top of the bread w/ foil so that it wouldn't get too dark). This makes a HUGE loaf...great for sharing! This was very easy to throw together...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I also added a pinch of cinnamon and about a tsp. of vanilla extract. My loaf turned out moist and fluffy. Perhaps the reason why some reviews stated that it didn't rise was because of over mixing? I've learned that with banana bread, if you over mix it turns out flat. I will definitely make this again!",

(You won\u2019t regret these very easy additions.) \n\nTo the batter, add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, in addition to chopped walnuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and pepitas/pumpkin seeds. Prior to pouring the batter into the loaf pan, spray cooking spray on the bottom, then rub a thin layer of butter directly from the stick. Add chopped walnuts, chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and brown sugar to cover the bottom of the pan, followed by another thin layer of cooking spray for adequate toasting. Place the pan in the oven to toast the bottom layer for 10 minutes (also at 325 degrees.) Remove from the oven and add the batter, then bake as directed. If you\u2019re not a fan of any of the above, you can adjust and use nuts and berries that you prefer. Turned out EXQUISITE, and we\u2019ve already made this six times.",
