They don't hold together well you need to serve them with a plate or napkin because they are crumbly and do fall apart. They are light and moist even 2 days later they are still nice and soft. They are a tasty cookie and everyone enjoyed them still I am not sure I would ever make this cookie again.",

My husband took to calling them muffin tops because they were a little crunchy on the outside but like cake inside. I made a few changes to this recipe: 1. I used canola oil instead of butter because I never bake with butter for health reasons 2. I put raisins instead of nuts 3. I left out the orange zest because I didn't have an orange at hand only orange juice. Next time I would make it with the zest.",
