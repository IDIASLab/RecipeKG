I measured out the 3 1/4 cups of flour twice to make sure I wasn't mistaken and that amount was too much. It was a fairly stiff dough for me (ended up not using the last 1/4 - 1/3 cup) but I still followed through - formed them into buns and baked them in a muffin tin. Delish! But will try again though.",
