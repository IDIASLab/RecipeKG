I omitted the salt and reduced the boullion cube to 1 used 1 tbsp each sherry and sour cream and added 1/2 cup of water on the end to make it saucier. I increased the seasonings and added sage and minced garlic. Next time I would double the mushrooms as well. We really enjoyed this it reminded me of The Magic Pan from when I was a child.

I had to add a little water to make the crepes thin enough and had to add a little butter to the pan prior to cooking each crepe. The recipe made 5 large crepes which I filled generously with the mushroom chicken mixture. Topped with the reserved mushroom mixture and baked for 20 minutes at 350 because it had cooled by the time I put it all together. Sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley just before serving. Lovely presentation and tasty.",
