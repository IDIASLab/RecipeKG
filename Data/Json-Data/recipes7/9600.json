With much research if found that the two actually go together. A little dill onion and sugar I was able to make a great slaw. I also added jalape\u00f1o. I'm not sure how to make my own recipe on here but this was good. I am an amazing cook able to fork out food with ingredients on hand. My krout is just literally stuffing cabbage in a jar with no extra ingredients so when a recipe calls for cabbage and vinegar the cabbage makes vinegar something I never knew before sailing. It is so good. I mean so good!",
