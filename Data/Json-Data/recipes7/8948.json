I used my food processor to mix the dry ingredients added the cold butter cut into small pieces and pulsed in the food processor to cut in the butter. I added the milk through the pour spout while pulsing. The dough appeared to be very wet. I scraped it onto a lightly floured mat and instead of 'kneading' it I just gently pulled the dough together into a rectangle with floured hands and a bench scraper. I used the bench scraper to cut the dough into 8 biscuits. Baked as directed for exactly 10 minutes. These were the most tender biscuits I have made. Really delicious! Thanks!",

I asked my 12 year old cousin to try it and she said \"It tastes just like the ones from KFC.\" I think they're a little moister than that though:) Recipe adjustments: I used two cups of wheat flour instead of one and skipped the sugar. The dough was a little sticky when I tried to roll it out so I added a little more flour than just the two cups. I also froze my butter and then grated it into the dough (a tip I read somewhere) and added just a tad more butter too. These taste great with a touch of honey on them and taste even better than they look!",
