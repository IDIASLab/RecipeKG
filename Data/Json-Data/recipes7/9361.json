I was worried at first that it was too thin, but it thickened a bit upon standing.  This syrup turned toasted frozen waffles into a special weekday breakfast.  I am excited to try this on homemade waffles and pancakes too.  It also crossed my mind to maybe try this with Nutella in place of peanut butter to make a chocolate syrup, I think I may do that next time.",
