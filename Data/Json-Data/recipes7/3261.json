I never make changes the first time but I had to due to my daughter having a soy allergy and also due to running out of cocoa which I thought I had enough of. So I will tell you what I did in case you find yourself needing to make last minute substitutions like I did. I doubled this recipe for our family of 6 and it made just enough for 4 small mugs and 2 big ones. I used vanilla rice milk did not add vanilla just 1/2 tsp of salt instead of doubling 1T of aguave (anymore sugar or salt would have been too much) I stuck to one pinch of cinnamon and cayenne and used 3 T of cocoa and 5T of non dairy chocolate chips because I ran out of cocoa. I also added a few more chocolate chips to mine and my husband's cups because I like it VERY rich and chocolately and I felt it needed some more after I poured it. My kids gobbled this up and I am so glad to have a recipe that works for my daughter. Thanks Cymbaline!",
