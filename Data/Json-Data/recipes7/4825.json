I'm going to try and change it.\nAlso, I have updated this recipe to use the new Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock from concentrate--it's amazing! Much better than tinned chicken broth. Another variation I tried out yesterday was to fry up a bit of panchetta or bacon, and then cook the onion in the rendered fat instead of the butter. Then top each bowl with a little bit of the panchetta/bacon. It adds depth to the flavor and makes it positively delectable!\n\nServe this soup with a dollop of sour cream or a drizzle of creme fraiche and a couple of croutons, or a side of garlic bread. Enjoy! :)",

I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the butter/onion mixture. And I didn't have an orange so I subbed in o.j. and no sour cream so I substituted plain Greek yogurt. Will make again!
