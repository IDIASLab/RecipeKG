I keep my grapefruits at room temperature on my counter. After cutting out the grapefruit I cut another one and removed the fruit and placed in a bowl (1 1/2 grapefruits). Next I took another small bowl and mixed the cinnamon and sugar together then drained the grapefruit (to drink) and ladled into ONE shell. I was intrigued by the addition of the butter so I decided to try adding it. The most time consuming part was tearing out the inside of the fruit so I used kitchen shears to make it easier and faster. If I were to make it again I would cut down on the cinnamon. Frankly it's just easier (and less time consuming) to cut and half sprinkle with sugar or slenda and cut the sections and eat!",
