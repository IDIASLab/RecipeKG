I thought it was very tofu heavy and light on meat so I would cut tofu in half and double up on the steak.  I also omitted the celery just because I don't love it cooked.  I cooked it in my pressure cooker and it turned out perfect! Great recipe!",

Meat and veg are brought out on a huge platter. Meat or veg is taken from the platter with hashi (chopsticks) piece by piece and cooked in the broth until done. It is most always served with white rice. Also a bowl of beaten raw or coddled egg is served to dip the meat in as well as a kind of teryiyaki broth. I highly recommend the egg. It is delicious this way. You can buy these cookers online for use at your table since most of us don't have the built in kind.",

After reading the reviews on the sugar we only put in half in and it tasted perfect (but I have a bit of a sweet-tooth and like sweet udon noodles, it might be worth putting in less if you feel otherwise as the mirin is quite sweet). We also doubled the noodles, and I think next time I might triple them as there was still plenty of broth to go around. We're also thinking about doubling the vegetarian broth in proportion to the other ingredients in the broth as it was quite strong (and mirin isn't always the cheapest!)",
