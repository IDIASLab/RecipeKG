Beer yeast will have too many off flavors that are important for different varieties of beer but not soda.  Also, be careful that you don't bottle in glass as you could create a bottle bomb depending on fermentation temp and how tight the cap/lid is.  As with any fermentation with yeast and fermentables (sugar) there will always be a % of alcohol (small but still present).  After 2-3 days the jug needs to be chilled and kept at fridgerator temps to force the yeast to settle and become inactive (they don't die just become inactive).  Remember, yeast is a living organism and will continue to thrive when conditions are right for them which means eating the sugars and creating the by-product alcohol.  ",

My brother and dad made wine several years ago and experienced a similar explosion (all over the room and one VERY happy guinea pig!) and were told to cap the bottle with a balloon.  The balloon expands with the gas, which can then be vented quite easily by pulling the neck of the balloon away from the bottle's neck.  No explosions and no mess!",

Because it's a bit difficult to put the grated ginger into those small-mouth bottles you can soak the grated ginger overnight in a separate container strain it and then pour it into the 2-ltr bottle together with the other ingredients. It works either way! Beats store-bought ginger ale by many miles and of course is much cheaper. The only(little)thing I would like to see changed is using something besides regular yeast so that it won't have that slight yeasty taste. Is there anything else that can be used to give it the needed carbonation? Does brewer's yeast have that same taste??",

I let all that ferment in the 2-liter bottle for 24 hours during which time I let the pressure off once or twice. Next I pour it through a sieve and a funnel into 20 oz soda bottles. A 2-liter bottle will fill three soda bottles. I leave these out to ferment for at least 24 more hours after which I refrigerate them. All this results in a ginger beer that is very carbonated but without too strong a taste of yeast (at least until you get close to the bottom of the bottle). It is not overly sweet and the ginger and lemon are both pronounced but not overpowering.",
