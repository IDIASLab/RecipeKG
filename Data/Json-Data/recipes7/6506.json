The few recipes I looked at before this one called for condensed milk or unbeaten egg whites which sounded unusual. So I tried my hand at this recipe. It was pretty simple to whip together easier than making chocolate chip cookies (and healthier). I don't think I'll ever need to resort to using condensed milk this IS the perfect coconut macaroon recipe.",

Wonderful texture and just the right amount of sweetness. The ratio of ingredients works perfectly. I find this kind of macaroon to be so much better than the kind made with sweetened condensed milk. I prefer larger shreds of coconut, so I skipped the step with the food processor. Instead I mixed all of the ingredients (minus the egg whites and extracts) in the mixer on low speed until well combined. After moving that mixture to a large bowl, I beat the eggs whites and then beat in the extracts. I omitted the almond extract this time, but I may add it back in next time. Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe!",

I did the first batch as directed 350 for 15 min.  but they didn't seem 'right'.. so I decreased the heat to 325 and upped the time to 22 min.  Those were much better. I used tablespoons , as I am not sure what golf ball sized meant.\nI pulsed the coconut in the food processor for 30 sec as directed, but in future batches, I think I will leave the coconut shaggier for a lighter, slightly dense  macaroon.  or at least only pulse half of the coconut.\nI did like the half vanilla half almond flavoring.  \n\nOverall, will make again, but with the changes as mentioned.",

I would NOT recommend adding extra flour as some reviews suggest - it would likely make them too dry.
