The recipe divided evenly to 4 Cups of sugar with perfect end-results .  I soaked the rhubarb in one Cup of sugar overnight, then added 3 more the next morning and let it sit another hour, stirring 3 Xs.  I tossed in the strawberries, freshly cut and NOT pre-soaked in sugar, which gave the starwberries a bit more voice in the mix, and also gave an 'almost' preservre-like density to my jam, which I think is ideal. As a tweak, I added 1/4 cup blueberry that was past baking quality.  They were a bit fridge-dried so I also soaked these in 1/4 Cup of sugar, over might. They plumped into a 1/2 Cup of lovely, not over-shouting blueberries, that gave a scosh more sweetness and a deeper color to the final product.  My end-result was the most 'regal' strawberry-rhubarb jam, ever - Devine inspiration in a container of slightly dreid up blueberries!  I winged the lemon, juice, adding probably 1/4 Cup., and cooked the jam mixture at a low rolling boil for a bit onger than suggested - about 40 minutes - and it passed the 'line on a plate' test beautifully.  My ingredient volumes, reduced into a jam, filled 5 8-oz jars, and this morning, my delicious tart and sweet jam had a medium-hard set to it, that my 2 teenagers self-served without making a mess (score); and they both headed out the door with a second piece of toast in-hand. That's a SCORE!",

Second, considering that this recipe does not call for pectin, 6 cups is way too much sugar.  Made this once as written and would rate it 3 stars...edible, too sweet and a bit loose.  Made it again with modifications for a 5 star strawberry rhubarb jam.  My modifications: used 1 1/2 lbs each srawberries and rhubarb (was about 5 cups each for me); used 2 1/2 cups sugar; used 1 tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tbsp of line juice; mixed the fruit and sugar and refrigerated overnight; then I strained the fruit and reduced the sugar and liquids before adding the fruit to the pot; after about 20 minutes of simmering I used a stick blender to puree the chunks out to be more suited for my kiddos tastes; then simmered for a bit longer tI'll it was nice and thick; then added the lemon and lime juice and processed 10 minutes.  My recipe yielded 4 almost 5 half pint (8oz) jars, about 30 oz total, because I used 3 1/2 cups (28oz) less sugar.",
