I subbed the goat cheese with a plain whole milk yogurt & cream cheese combination. Biggest issue with this is using six cups of berries. Four cups of berries are good for a deepdish pie. Six cups & you're asking for disaster. I made a little more crust & used a ten inch quiche dish. Perfect fit. The basil was barely detectable; fine. Any creaminess is lost in all those berries.

I made the recipe exactly as written except for using 3/4 cup of the honey goat cheese. I did think about adding about a teaspoon of lemon but decided not to. I'm glad I didn't because it certainly wasn't needed and it may have over powered the amazing flavor of the fresh basil which was so clever! It is what makes this pie so unique while adding to the freshness of the blueberries. I love love this pie! Thank you Elise! Love your videos sweetie. Keep'em coming!",
