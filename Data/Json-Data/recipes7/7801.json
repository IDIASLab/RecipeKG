I had the best luck with Jonathan apples. I did three batches.  Two batches with winesap and one with Jonathan. (My said Jonathan apples had to be good for something.) Turns out he was right. \n\nI will say that you absolutely HAVE to use enough sugar. Not for the sweetness, but because it aids the natural pectin in the apples. If you dont' use enough sugar, the jelly will NOT set up right.  Also, the more red pealing you can use, the brighter the color your jelly will be. I added a couple drops of food coloring because I like that pretty orange coloring. :)",
