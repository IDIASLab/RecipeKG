The mixture of cornstarch and water was a little concerning as it hardened immediately, but once added to the egg & beef mixture it was fine.

I don't eat much sugar and I was dubious since carrots and ginger are also sweet. The sugar with the soy sauce reminded me of Dr. Pepper just a little. Next time I'll use just a bit of honey. I like veggies and was going to add broccoli but I didn't, next time I will. 4 stars for a recipe that sounded so delicious it pulled me out of my comfort zone (cornstarch and frying were a first for me). 1 star off only because of personal preference.",

Also, after slicing the meat, I put it in a bowl, cracked an egg on top, and mixed with my hands. Then I threw the cornstarch on top without the water. Worked fine! \nOverall it had great flavor! I feared I should have salted the beef, but it all tasted great when I finished. And it really wasn't that much work! Typical stirfry that needed its share of chopping, but well worth it!!",
