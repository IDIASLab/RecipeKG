I used pineapple chunks (well-drained) and overly ripe bananas. Even though the recipe did not call for them I added 1/2 c. of finely chopped walnuts. Since we are lovers of coconut I sprinkled some toasted coconut over the top of the muffins when I removed them from the oven. This would make an excellent muffin for a brunch or shower. This was the AR Buzz Recipe Group selection for the week of 4/5/14. Thank you EatCookLove90 for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper for me!",

I didn't have rum extract so I used real rum but I couldn't taste it in the finished prouduct. I need to buy some rum extract and try these again sometime.

Like Shearones, they were done in 12 minutes.  Because my guys aren't crazy about coconut, I put the 3/4 cup in the batter, but only added it to the tops of 12 before baking. Since I was making smaller muffins I used tidbits rather than chunks.  I drained the pineapple really well and used the pineapple juice to make a batch of gelatin. My DH must have really liked them, coconut included and all, because 2 minutes out of the oven and he was eating his first one.  Five minutes later and he had eaten 3!  Thanks, EatCookLove90 for sharing your muffin recipe.",
