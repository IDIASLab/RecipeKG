I don't know if it's because my pallet got used to the taste, but after the second and third bite I could no longer taste it. Nonetheless it was good. I don't know if I would make it again but thanks for the recipe.",

My family doesn't like raisins in their cooked desserts so I substituted 1/4 cup finely diced crystallized ginger as we love gingery foods I increased the pumpkin pie spice to an even 1 tbsp. I used pureed Kabocha squash which has a pumpkin/sweet potato flavor and texture. Used walnuts in place of the pecans (didn't have on hand). The next time I make this I plan to mix all the wet ingredients before pouring over the bread crumbs. I ended up with a delightful pudding on top of a bread pudding that was a bit bland though my husband gobbled it up. I don't have a 7 x 11 inch baking dish so I used a large well greased and lightly floured bundt pan. The bread pudding easily flipped out of the bundt pan and onto a plate for serving.",
