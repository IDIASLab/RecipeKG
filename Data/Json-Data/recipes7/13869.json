For one thing, the recipe calls for a 9X13 inch pan, while the picture shows what looks like a round cake pan. The recipe says to roll the bread dough into a large rectangle, which I found difficult - the dough kept springing back. And what is \"large\"? Also it seems to me that two loaves of bread dough make many more than 24 rolls. I refrigerated the dough overnight, but it didn't really double.  And the caramel topping all but disappeared. They taste okay, but I think the recipe needs to be more specific. Maybe I was expecting something different. I'd be interested if anyone else had the same experience.",
