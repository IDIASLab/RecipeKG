I was so excited when I got home I did a test run before my Christmas Eve party and it's a good thing I did. I did not care for it at all. I thought it just might be me but my husband thought so too. I double checked the recipe and did a second test run with less peppermint schnapps as some reviewers suggested and it was a little better but not much. If you have the stuff around give it a try because all of the other reviews were good you might like it but I wouldn't go out of your way like I did.",
