Mine said 2 minutes, and I could see some of the tortellini already uncurling at about 1-1/2 minutes, so I took them off the heat (8-10 minutes would have destroyed this particular brand).  Also, once they\u2019re drained and you\u2019re waiting for them to cool, they\u2019re starting to stick together.  The next step should be adding the dressing and giving them a good stir, to separate  and then add all of the veggies.  There simply was not enough dressing, so I will increase that amount in the future, otherwise, the salad will be a bit on the dry side.  This really was super simple to make and tasted pretty good.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
