I also made my own apple sauce using 2 apples which cooked while I was putting the rest of the ingredients togther. Thanks for this recipe.",

If someone told me they were only that many calories I wouldn't believe them! I added more chocolate chips about a 1/4 cup more flour and a tablespoon of butter the batter seemed like it was missing something they may have gone over 63 calories but they are still a lot lighter than the 500 calorie ones on this site and taste origional and amazing! Make this recipe with these alterations and you won't be dissappointed!",
