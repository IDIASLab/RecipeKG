The applesauce keeps it vegan, unlike the egg that another review suggested. Pushed the dough into prepared 9x13 glass baking dish. Baked 350 for 30 minutes. I just ate a piece and it is delicious, still warm. I think they will cool and cut well. My version is thicker more like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie bar. I use vegan chocolate chips from Whole Foods and they taste just the same as regular. This recipe is similar to the cowboy cookie mix in a jar recipe that I made from this site.",

Following the advice of another reviewer I cut each kind of sugar by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also subbed raw sugar for white sugar of course to make it vegan. Instead of chocolate chips I used dried apricots and walnuts. I will definitely be making this one again!",
