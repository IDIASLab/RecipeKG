I had some leftover corn in the fridge so I added that to it also which was a nice addition. I ended up adding a can of condensed cream of potato soup at the end and that thickened it nicely.

Maybe my review will be helpful to those of you who don't have everything on hand. First I used pork that had been cooked in the crock pot and I didn't saute the onions or garlic. My measurement were roughly: 1 1/2lb pork rump roast 1/2 onion 2 cloves sliced garlic 5-6 small potatoes 3/4 C uncooked cubed butternut squash 1 C uncooked cubed sweet potato 1/3 of a yellow bell pepper and 1 sliced carrot. I followed the spices exactly as mentioned in the recipe but I didn't have real bullion so I used 2 cubes of chicken bullion and 2 cubes of beef bullion. I don't know how much water I had; I just filled it about 3in higher than the ingredients in the pot and let it all cook until tender. About 15 minutes before I took it off the fire I thickened the mixture with flour and added the 2 peeled cut/cored green apples as suggested. I would definitely recommend this recipe - turned out great even with variations. Next time I'll follow it exactly. I was concerned about adding apples but am really glad I did. Also I thought the squash tasted good too and next time will be sure to add more as recommended. Thanks so much for this recipe.",

I did some minor alterations I had some bone in pork chops I saute'd them like the recipe says with garlic onion (i added flour at this step)flour garlic salt and pepper in some butter and olive oil and then de-glazed with dry white wine about a cup and continued to simmer while the broth and herbs where boiling down. Added rest of broth and veggies I like time to meld the flavors and allow the veggies to cook and the pork to break down. The pork was now tender the squash melted into the broth to make a fabulous thick stew...do not cover to allow to reduce. I added the apples a half hour before serving and wish I would of not put them in. The broth before was super good the apples made it a tad too sweet (you may love it ) but I had to continue to follow the recipe. Overall recipe was wonderful but give it time to stew! Notes: I make my own broth with better than bullion my favorite! Fresh rosemary was also used paired very well with rosemary pull apart rolls (I found here!)",
