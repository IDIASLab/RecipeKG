I used reduced-fat cream cheese white bread (didn't have any wheat on hand) and did put a little butter in the skillet along with the oil. The filling is loaded with luscious and creamy banana flavor with a hint of cinnamon and just enough sweetness. A definite remake in this house with nice enough presentation for company brunch. Thanks Glo for this wonderful new recipe.",

I suggest cutting the filling in half because I ended up using 14 pieces of bread and 6 eggs and STILL had about a cup of extra filling (which I was happy to eat with a spoon). That was using a heaping tablespoon of filling per roll and sorta trifolding them and sinching the ends so it didn't ooze out on my griddle. I dusted mine with powdered sugar and the kiddos ate them whole and dunked them in syrup. I think they'd be good with nuts incorporated for a Banana Nut Bread flavor.",
