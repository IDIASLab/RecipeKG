I would have preferred the chocolate be more of a ganache-ish full layer on top, rather than a smattering of chocolate chips.  The PB topping was tough to drizzle, too, despite quadrupling the milk to thin it out.  Taste was good, but these were tough to make look \"good\".  Thanks for the recipe, Briecookinglove!",

I have another recipe that is cooked at a 400 oven where the chips are easily immediately spread them. I even took these out turned oven up covered dish with foil and put back in another 5 minutes. No luck. But I guess we should have had a clue looking at the picture given - those choc chips are not melted and spread either. Waiting for them to cool to try. Used what was left of caramel sauce mixed with peanut butter and a little confec sugar and milk to get consistency I wanted to dribble over top.",

My chocolate chips melted easily (dark chocolate...are people using milk choc. and they don't melt as easily... they would be too sweet for the base I think) and I spread them over using horizontal strokes. I used lots of milk in the drizzle until like a frosting or fudge sauce consistency and scooped in a ziplock bag snipped the corner to pipe it. Made long vertical stripes over the chocolate layer. Very good but the icing hardened up stiffer over the chocolate layer making it kind of crumble and fall off when cutting cooled bars. Very yummy though. Next time I plan to put chips in the dough and just PB topping spread on top or sprinkle REESE's Pieces in the melted chocolate layer and not do the drizzle.",
