I used all brown sugar, a full teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla, and almond milk in place of regular milk. They have a wonderful banana bread flavor with the perfect amount of spice! And while the muffin recipe is great as written, I think you could completely tailor the \"add-ins\" to whatever you like! I want to make them again with the addition of dark chocolate chips, or shredded coconut, or almonds---or all three! I also got 17 muffins out of this, and they were perfectly baked in 18 minutes. Thank you for the recipe--I will definitely make these again!",

Omitted brown sugar in favor of 1/3 c choc chips (7yr old's request). Perfect amount of sweet. :) Also used 1-2 T applesauce as part of the 1/3 c. oil, still plenty moist (this trick for reducing fat works well in muffins, just pour a bit of applesauce in bottom of measuring cup, then fill with oil). My 3 bananas measured 1 2/3 c, but a bit less would've worked.  KEEPER!!!",

It made 18 muffins, I had to reduce cooking time to 15 minutes and turn temp down to 375 as my oven gets extra hot.  It still burned on the bottom a bit but again I think it was more of an issue with my oven than the recipe.  They are hearty muffins and not real sweet which we liked.  It\u2019s a good healthier muffin and we enjoyed them.",
