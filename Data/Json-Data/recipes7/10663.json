If you make this recipe as written without adjusting the servings you should get about three dozen (36) cookies. I rolled my dough into sugar and then into perfect balls and didn't flatten the cookies at all and you can see from my photo how much they spread out. I don't recommend flattening them at all. Just add the Hershey Kisses firmly into the centers as they come out. They tasted great and I would be open to using this recipe again!",
