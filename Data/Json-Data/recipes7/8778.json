It is easily pipeable into fun shapes which my daughter loves. Do not add more milk. My suggestion is use a half cup measure and let what batter comes get cooked and what stays behind go into the next pancake; there is no need for a spatula. Also these make great waffles. I stick to the recipe except I do use coconut oil for both frying and in the batter and a high quality gluten-free flour.",
