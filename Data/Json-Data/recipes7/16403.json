        "description": "I liked the Ezekiel bread recipe on this site. I need high-protein bread, so I researched the Bible and other cookbooks and I came up with this recipe. It can be halved and the grains or beans can be removed as your tastes prefer.  I hope you like this. My family and church members certainly did! Bread can be eaten right away or wrapped and frozen whole or sliced. Drink plenty of water when eating this bread. This bread is very low in carbs so it is a good bread to diet on.",
