I mixed and matched pieces from recipes found on the internet to come up with one that has these beautiful colors, flavors, and texture. I love to serve this on top of a softened block of cream cheese with butter crackers as an appetizer. It's also a great marinade/glaze (when mixed with a bit of soy sauce) for pork and chicken.",
