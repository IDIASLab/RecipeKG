I would make again (great chocolate fix) but I would just dish it out from the pan itself and serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I kept putting the cake back in the oven thinking it just needed more time to bake but that wasn't the case. I would rate this five stars if not for the consistency- but it isn't called \"Chocolate Fudge PUDDING (Cake)\" for nothing. Expect more pudding than cake and you will be very pleased.:)",
