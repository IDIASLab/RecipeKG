I ended up with 11 cupcakes using an ice cream scoop, which was fine--just an FYI.  \n\nI live at 7,000ft and these came out great! The mixture seemed a little runny, but my test cupcake came out fine so I didn't add any extra flour.  \n\nThe only thing I modified about the recipe is that I added some whole anise seeds for fun.  It's fun to get a faint licorice tang with some bites",
