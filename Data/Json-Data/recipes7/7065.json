Being a home cook chef, he gave it high ratings. The cake was crispy yet tender. It lent itself to the juices of the strawberries. I made chocolate covered strawberries dipped in finely chopped pecans and decorated the top of the cake with them. Of course I had whipped on the top for a bed for them.  The center was uncovered to show the strawberries. I will use this cake recipies for all my fruit shortcakes.",

Growing up on Bisquick shortcake,I was never crazy about because it always tasted dry and bland.As an adult I started making strawberry shortcake using angel food cake or making a butter pound cake.I am sure glad I decided to give this shortcake recipe a try! I used full whipping cream to replace the milk in the dough because that's all I had,and I used a  pinch of pumpkin pie spice to replace the nutmeg, as I couldn't find nutmeg in my kitchen cabinets.I agree with another reviewer,and I think the shortcake tastes like shortbread and it literally melts in your mouth with each bite.
