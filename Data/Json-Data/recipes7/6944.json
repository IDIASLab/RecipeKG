The only changes I made were to use tamarind concentrate instead of the paste (it was all they had at the Asian grocery store), and I forgot to add the paprika at the end.  I would have liked it to be a bit saucier.  I'm not sure if I cooked it a bit too long and the sauce got all soaked up or if I just need to make more sauce next time.  Even still the flavors were wonderful so I am giving this 5 stars.  Thanks for the great recipe.",

Only things I did differently is: I marinated the chicken over night in coconut milk, the zest of 1 lime and about a teaspoon of red pepper flake. I also grilled the chicken and added the chicken to the rest of the ingredients in the wok just before the cooking was complete. Came out DELICIOUS, and the chicken had a more authentic texture as opposed to cooking the chicken in a skillet. Thanks for the amazing recipe!",

I believe there were two main issues with the first attempt I had.  I couldn't find tamarind paste, only concentrate.  When I searched online, I had found some posts saying you could use these interchangeably.  I think this caused the sauce to be too thick.  The second mistake was that I didn't soak the noodles long enough.  The store I went to only had not flat rice noodles.  I also soaked them in probably too cold of water.  I tried to cook the noodles longer because they were so stiff, which combined with the thicker sauce just turned the noodles into a thick gummy mess.\n\nThe second attempt I used just over a tablespoon of tamarind concentrate and also soaked the flat noodles for the full hour in room temperature water.    Everything else I followed to the dot and it turned out great.",

You could probably just use 1.5X the fish sauce as it's a very strong flavor (2X the other ingredients in the mixture).  I used a tamarind paste substitute because I couldn't find any in my town (blend of prunes, lemon juice and dried apricots and was VERY close to the real thing).  I also added a tablespoon of worcestshire sauce to the final product while the noodles were cooking.  I mixed some of the chives and a dash of cilantro in the mixture in addition to using them as garnishes.  I used 5 eggs instead of 4 but only because we love eggs.

                "reviewBody": "I followed two recipes, partly this one partly another.  Let that guide what you think of my review.  \n\nI did not add any vinegar, because the tamarind imparts a very acidic flavor on its own.  It has a \"lactic\"-y flavor like sun dried tomatoes.  Other recipes will not include vinegar, and if you watch the video for this recipe, the guy actually doesn't mention vinegar.  They show vinegar being used, but the guy only mentions the other 3 ingredients.  Maybe if you are starting off with very fresh tamarind you would need it, but the tamarind paste I have was already quite sour in flavor.\n\nMany people making this will want an excess of sauce to drizzle over at the end.  The sauce is thin compared to the sauce at restaurants.  If you want something thicker, brown some onions and puree it into the sauce.  The cellulose will give it some of the body that a cream woiuld, but without changing the flavor.\n\nAlso, I used palm sugar, and most recipes that allow for a substitute will recommend brown sugar.\n\n(double these ingredients for the recipe on this page)\n\n1 tbsp. tamarind paste, to taste (available at Asian/Indian food stores)\n1/4 cup chicken stock  (campbells)\n3 Tbsp. fish sauce  (i used Thai Kitchen)\n1 Tbsp. soy sauce  (i used kikkoman)\n1/2 to 1 tsp. chili sauce, OR 1/3 to 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, to taste  (i used red curry paste, Thai Kitchen brand)\n1/8 tsp. ground white pepper\n3-4 Tbsp. palm sugar OR brown sugar",
