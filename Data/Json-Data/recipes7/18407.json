I now add a sliced spicy pepper such as jalape\u00f1o or Anaheim. At first I took out the seeds but now I leave them in. I have used other veggies as well: fennel bulb and fronds sliced garlic onion beets--glorious color cucumbers and zucchini. Sometimes several of these at once. One time I got really adventurous and added some coriander and anise. Maybe not traditional but easy and delicious. We eat them with all kinds of sandwiches from tuna to egg to grilled cheese. Use them to garnish rice dishes. And put them in salad. The brine makes a great base for salad dressing. Thanks so much for a great basic recipe.",
