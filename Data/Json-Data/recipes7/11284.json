The secret is to stir constantly for a rich, velvety smooth pudding-like melt-in-your-mouth experience. These instructions are per my grandmother, written down by my mother not too long before Grandma passed away. Grandma wouldn't give the recipe away until her last years. It's a family treasure now! Top the pie with meringue, whipped cream, or whipped topping.",

                "reviewBody": "This is essentially the same recipe that has been passed down in my family however our process is a little different.  First, we mix the flour sugar salt and milk together and use ONLY flour (don't substitute cornstarch due to the pineapple reaction preventing thickening sometimes).  When cooked and thickening, add the DRAINED pineapple till bubbling custard, THEN temper the beaten eggs with a little of the hot custard added to bowl of eggs, mixed, THEN put the tempered eggs into the pan of custard stirring well.   Suggest a thick wooded spoon for this job.  When fairly thick...take off heat...add cold butter...and vanilla and beat with spoon till glossy and well mixed in same pot.  It will be a thick pudding like.  Pour into prebaked pie shell (regular 9 in).  Cover with meringue if you wish.  Otherwise...a piece of buttered WAX paper will sit nicely on top OF THE CUSTARD, touching the surface, after a few minute of cooling.  If put on too soon, condensation may occur...if wait till cool...then a skin may form after a hour or so...all of which won't keep the Texas men from eating every piece.  My family served room temp during cold weather...then IF there was left overs...we refrigerated the 2nd or 3rd pie.  Usually the first pie went as soon as dinner was over.\nUsing the tempered egg procedure is preferable since things thicken faster than if done the other way IMHO and if it is good enough for grandma...then it is OK with me.  I was the \"stirrer\" of pie fillings during hol",
