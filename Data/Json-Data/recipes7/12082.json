The only thing I did different was use cinnamon applesauce instead of regular since that is what I had in the house already. Nice and moist and a lot less oil than other recipes I've used. I'll definitely be making it again.",

But AMAZING taste/texture. I also drained the zucchini then threw in half of that liquid because I go to nervous it would be dry. Used a whole cup of chocolate chips because my husband refused to eat without",

A few minor adds.\" Made my zucchini bread \"mama-milk-friendly\" by adding a TB of brewer's yeast and subbing 1/2 c of the flour for 1/2 c rolled oats. Some zucchini bread recipes say to put the grated zuc right in the batter others say to drain the moisture. I went the draining route this time and my bread was a little on the dry side which was either due to that or dropping one egg. Glad that I started my oven timer at 45 min. and checked at 50 min. b/c my bread was very much done at that point. Texture aside the taste was incredible and I plan on making this again but maybe in muffin tins instead.",
