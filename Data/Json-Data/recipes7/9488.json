I used honey crisp apples and it probably would have been fine without any sugar added.

Think I'll stick with whatever Apple's are cheapest & continue to leave sugar out & save on calories, really doesn't need the sugar anyway. This would be great served over some vanilla frozen yogurt too.",

I microwave my sauce (water candies) about 3 minutes on high in a 4 cup glass bowl then stir until dissolved. Add peeled and chopped apples without extra sugar) stir cover with plastic wrap and microwave until tender (about 5 minutes on high). Mash with a fork or immersion blender for more smooth texture. Serve warm or cold. The smell in the kitchen from the cinnamon is divine. Great as a side with pork or as a dessert after dinner.",

After measuring 1/4 cup I had very few candies left so I just threw them all in. Don't be tempted as I was in the beginning to add more water. The apples release more liquid after the sugar is added. I did have to cook the final product longer than 15 minutes...about double that for the apples to be soft all the way through. I used my immersion blender and had some of the best applesauce I've ever made. I like Sarah Jo's idea of putting everything in the slow cooker and will definitely try that next time.",
