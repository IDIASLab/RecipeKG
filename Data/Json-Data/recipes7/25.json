The first batch I made with Splenda and lowfat baking mix. I did add 2T milk to get the right consistency. I also used almond flavoring instead of coconut. My husband gobbled up the whole batch! He loved them! I made them again for a school potluck with real sugar and almond extract. I formed them into balls thumbprinted them and put maraschino cherry halves in the print. They were beautiful AND yummy! This is a fun different recipe that I will use over and over. I think I'm going to do mint next with dark chocolate disks in the print. Thank you!",
