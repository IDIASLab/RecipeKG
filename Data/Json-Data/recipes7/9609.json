Just drizzle the cooked orzo with just enough vegetable oil to very lightly coat it, to keep it from sticking, cover and refrigerate. Or make it even farther ahead and freeze until needed. Likewise with the wild rice, cover and refrigerate or freeze \u2013 no tossing in oil is needed for the rice. The nuts can be toasted several days in advance; cool and store in an airtight container. Dried cranberries or raisins can easily be substituted for the currants. And leftovers are quite good, but the nuts will have lost some of their crunch. If you make this I hope you enjoy it.",

It is one of my favorite \"go-to\" salads for a BBQ with company (it also travels well)! I have never changed anything except to use dried cranberries instead of currants. It is very easy to assemble if you heed Bellepepper's suggestion to cook the orzo and wild rice ahead of time (toss the cooked orzo lightly in veg. or olive oil) freeze and toast the nuts a few days before. I assemble the day before entertaining but save the nuts and parsley to add just before serving. Serve this and I promise someone will ask you for the recipe! Thanks BP great recipe!",

I did have to make some subs dried cranberries instead of currants (currants are yummy though) walnuts instead of pecans (it was still good) and red wine vinegar instead of white. That being said the taste was just a little different using the red instead of white vinegar and it did color the rice and orzo darker. I'll have to buy white wine vinegar now. I did add a lot more wild rice than calls for just my preference. The dressing is what makes this salad in my opinion. You can add in or take out from the salad part too but the dressing is just ummmmmmmm. Thanks Belle!!",

Since currants are so tiny I would follow the advice from linda2d-if subbing raisins or craisins chop them first. The texture was fantastic I would sprinkle the nuts on at the end if making in advance. Wild rice and orzo were 2 new ingredients added to my pantry this is a very economical fresh idea for a salad for future potlucks and family gatherings. Thanks for sharing.",

I made the rice and orzo ahead of time then tossed everything but the nuts and parsley together a few hours before serving. Everyone then added the nuts and parsley to their individual servings because of personal tastes. I thought there would be lots left over but the salad was soooo good that there was barely enough for a serving for lunch for one. It is a great recipe for my vegetarian daughter. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Bellepepper! Update June 9 2014- I've made this numerous times and always get requests for the recipe!",
