I agree with adding hot sauce at the end and the amount of sugar he uses. I will update my review after I make it but if you want something more sophisticated give this a try. I plan to make it the day before. I would definitely make it again. It was perfect with the entire meal with the right amount of sweet tart hot and complex blend of flavors. I used Tabasco brand habanero sauce because habanero pairs perfect with fruit. You can make this two days ahead. A little goes a long way we have tons left over and I am going to make crostini and top with goat cheese and the cranberry sauce as an appetizer tonight.",

Will update my review after my family and guests have a chance to taste this intriguing cranberry sauce. As per Chef John's video's recommendation I kept hunting until I found 'the ghost' - didn't find the brand he used but did find Born to Hula - Ghost of Ancho just this morning (whew!!!). Well back to the kitchen I go!!!!! --- Okay - it's the day after Thanksgiving and votes are in. It was unanimous - family and guests raved about the cranberry sauce. It is officially now a STAPLE at our family Thanksgiving table from now on. SUGGESTION: Give yourself plenty of time to find THE GHOST hot sauce. i found the brand Chef John used (Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce) online and will make sure to have it handy the next time I make this.",
