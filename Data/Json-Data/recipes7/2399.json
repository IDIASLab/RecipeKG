Also, the frosting won't separate from the brownie if you put it on when the brownies are still warm.  My habit with making this is to put all the ingredients into the pot that need to boil together while the brownies bake.  I also put the cup of chocolate chips in the measuring cup and add the splash of vanilla (otherwise I forget it) to that cup.  As soon as I mix in the chocolate chips, I pour it over the brownies.  I never have problems with separation.  It amazes me the ways people have used this frosting and the variations they have found work for them.  I can honestly say it never occurred to me to use this on anything other than brownies, and my Mom was equally shocked when I told her people use it on other things!   Thanks for giving ME ideas for ways to use this.  I do have a friend who refers to the brownies I make with this frosting as \"brudge\" -- a combination of brownie and fudge. ;-)",

The peanut butter chips melted differently than the chocolate so I threw in 2 tbs peanut butter as well. It suited my needs perfectly and I could tell it'd make a great chocolate frosting (as intended in the original recipe)",
