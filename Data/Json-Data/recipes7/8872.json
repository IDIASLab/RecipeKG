I had wanted to make lemon poppyseed muffins but didn't have sour cream or yogurt on hand so I was skeptical of how this would turn out but I am so glad I made it! Next time I will try subbing some applesauce for the oil and I will definitely double it. I did get 12 out of this batch but they are going to go quickly in my house I'm sure!",

Maybe I'm just a lemon-holic, but I would suggest using at least a few more tablespoons of lemon juice to give it that real lemon taste. Also, I added a lemon glaze directly after removing the muffins from the oven, which was pretty decadent on the sugar side of things, but it was very pretty and added even more lemon, which I love! Anyway, the glaze is really simple- 1/4 cup milk, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and about 2 tablespoons of whatever lemon you have (lemon extract use a little less). Also, you should know that the texture on these are great! They bake fantastically too, seeing as, unlike most lemon poppyseed recipes that use yogurt, the bater wasn't too heavy.",

I also added just a touch more flour to balance out the batter - which is far more liquid than many muffin batters, but baked up wonderfully.\n\nI wound up with 12 muffins, not 10 - which is no problem, of course - and they are delicious! These are also some of very few muffins I've made from scratch that actually rose and looked poofy, like they are supposed to do. I will definitely be making this again.

They were light and fluffy and had a great round flavor. \nI am giving them four stars instead of five for a couple of reasons. #1 They were not \"quick\" in my opinion. We always do our muffins from scratch and these took longer than most due to the zesting and juicing of the lemons. #2 I took the advice of others and added more lemon. I actually upped the lemon to 1/3 cup and found that they could have even been more lemony for real lemon lovers. #3 The glaze made them too sweet. We did without. Otherwise, great recipe!
