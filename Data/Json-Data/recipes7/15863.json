I only used half of the frosting, using all butter, and I added cocoa to half of that frosting so I could pipe it in a decorative fashion.   I'm not sure what I would have done with the whole frosting recipe!  The middle of the final product was quite raw which will probably make my granddaughters happy!  I'm reviewing this before they taste it, so I'm just guessing how they would rate it.",

Then each kid decorated the top of the cookie with ice cream on the side. So fun and it let the kids be creative.",

I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from some cinnamon rolls I made the day before, so I used that in place of the buttercream called for here (I only had about 3/4 cup frosting, and that was plenty). I would probably go with the cream cheese frosting again, because the flavor combo was killer! I also wanted to make this a 'funfetti' style chocolate chip cookie cake, so I reduced the white sugar to 1/8 of a cup, and added in 1/4 cup jimmy sprinkles. My cake needed 24 minutes to bake, and was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe.",
