As I was measuring I discovered I was almost out of sugar so I ended up using 1/2 cup sugar + 12 packets of splenda which is the recommended substitute amount.  I also added an extra tablespoon of jam - strawberry because that's what I had on hand.  The result is amazing!  Light and fluffy and tastes delicious.  I skipped the frosting because I figured I'm already getting more than enough calories for breakfast here :)  I was so distracted by the jelly in the recipe that I completely missed that it had mayonnaise until I was halfway through.  If I'd noticed I might have skipped this recipe, but I'm so glad I didn't!",
