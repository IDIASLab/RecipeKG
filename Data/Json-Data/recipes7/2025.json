The dough is nice to work with and is very delicate and has fantastic flavor. The end result is very pretty- it's a shame we ate it before I thought to take a picture. A couple tips: Make sure to seal the seams very very well- it has a tendency to blow out. I couldn't find almond paste so I ran some sliced almonds and some butter in the food processor until it was smooth. I don't know if that is very authentic but it tasted great! If I could rate this a 4.5 I would for the following reasons: 1- The dough is very fattening with the heavy cream 2- The cardamom makes this relatively expensive to make",

We had a bakery that baked these and I have been trying to figure out how to make them ever since it closed!\nThe directions were good but I don't think that the wiodth of the strip is meant to be 2\".  I ended  up making it 6\".  The dough was sticky so I put some flour on the waxed paper which helped.  The sugar coating helped to prevent it from sticking when I stretched the tube.  I think another time I would stretch it quite a lot farther to make a narrower Kringle.  We would put in less sugar and no almond extract and no cinnamon next time as well.\nIt is fussy, but it is very nice. Thanks again.\n",

The nice thing about this recipe is the tube can be shaped into something other than a ring. Last year I made a heart not sure what I'll do this year I may attempt a snowflake.

I also only used the almond paste as the filling with sprinkling on some sliced almonds over the top of it and a little bit of cinnamon and sugar (I did not combine the almond paste 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and almond extract together). The marzipan/almond paste is plenty sweet and already has almond extract in it so 1/2 cup sugar more is unnecessary (in my personal taste). I also wanted less of a cinnamon taste and more of an almond taste. One thing that helped with forming the pretzel shape was watching a you tube video on kringle. There is a bakery that shows how to shape it. The width of the dough should be 6 inches not 2 when you roll it out with the filling taking up the very middle 2 inches. Then fold over each side on top of the filling seal and pat out any air bubbles. Then kind of stretch the roll as you lift it and then shape like the pretzel (I didn't actually roll the dough into a log to stretch it or roll it in sugar at this point). After forming the pretzel shape I used the egg wash and sprinkled the top with raw sugar and the sliced almonds. Beautiful and delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

This worried me but the bread rose beautifully once it was a loaf shape. Second it's very important that your filling is spreadable and not a powder. I used homemade almond paste and my filling was more of a powder than a paste which caused me problems. If I had it to do again I'd have added an egg white to make it stickier. Third keep the dough refrigerated until right before you roll it out otherwise it will get sticky and will tear easily. Fourth when it's done baking it will still look a little doughy. I overcooked this because I thought it wasn't done and the doughier parts turned out the most delicious later on. The texture is closer to a coffee cake than a loaf of bread. I had a hard time rolling out the shape to the full 40 inches before the outer layer got thin enough to start tearing so at that point (probably about 30 inches) I just twisted it up into a loaf and let it rise. But in the end this was absolutely delicious. Moist and very very rich with beautiful flavors that complemented each other very well. Highly recommend and I will try it again now that I know how.",
