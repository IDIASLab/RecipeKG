I just got a new waffle iron, so this was its test run, and it was a successful one.  I could totally see folding some crisp bacon into this recipe's batter.  I did half a recipe, and the servings was spot on, four.  If you're a fan of the Southern favorite, Chicken and Waffles, this would be the perfect waffle!  Thanks darthotto for sharing your recipe.",

To reduce the calorie count further I replaced the oil with vanilla Greek yogurt and reduced the milk slightly to compensate for the extra moisture yogurt would bring. I didn't separate the eggs but instead added a pinch of cream of tarter when I whisked the whole egg in hopes that would retain the fluffiness. Both substitutions worked beautifully and definitely a keeper recipe!!",
