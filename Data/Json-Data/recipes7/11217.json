So I changed it\n\nBase - the same except I added 2 tablespoons of candied ginger,  medium chop.  I wanted there to be ginger in the base but not uniform - I wanted there to be real surprises.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract\n\nThe top - I used 1/2 c of low fat sweetened condensed milk and no other sugar.  1 egg, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 c of flour and 3 c of rhubarb.  lastly I added 2/3 c of sliced almonds as I thought the texture was likely to be to uniform.  Baked for about the same amount of time at same temp - until the almond slices were just starting to brown.\n\nFantastic",

I baked the crust in a 9\" pie pan rather than a square pan.  I also only used 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar and upped the rhubarb to 3 cups.
