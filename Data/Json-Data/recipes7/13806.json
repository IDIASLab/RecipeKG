The flavor was wonderful. A nice mild curry with good flavor. I like a bit of heat so I added a couple drops of Carolina Reaper sauce to mine. Super easy to make. It's a winner and I'll definitely make it again.",

The first time I made it I used shrimp and then I used \"Red Thai Coconut Curry Sauce\" and it just wasn't \"right\"  I ordered some Panang paste off Amazon and that made all the difference in the world in regards to the taste.  The nice thing about this recipe is  you can add whatever vegetables you want to it.  I've seen panang with asparagus, peanuts, snow peas, mushrooms and they were all delicious.  I have only added mushrooms, I bought snow peas too, but forgot to put them in.",

The last step took a bit longer than what is written, more like 8 minutes to get tender. But method is fantastic. I added a red onion, too.",
