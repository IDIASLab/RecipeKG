Instead of currants we used craisins in one batch and chocolate chips in another.  One batch we just left plain.  Since we were having a mixture of various types I didn't want them too big so I cut each rectangle in half before I cut the triangles giving us 24 scones in each batch. The scones were plenty large enough after that cut.  We also made them the weekend before, cooked them almost done (about 15 minutes for us) and then froze them.  On the day of the shower we took them out of the freezer to defrost.  We then cooked them for another 5-7 minutes to finish cooking and heat them up nicely.",

It is different than scones with cream. These ones were less dense and more of a cakey center. The outside was crisp. They were delicious. My family thought they could be a little sweeter, but that is a personal preference. Soaking the currants made them pop a bit. My other recipe didn't call for that step, but I will be doing that from now on. We will definitely be making this recipe again.",
