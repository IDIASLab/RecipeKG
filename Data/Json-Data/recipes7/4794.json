I let my strawberries sit for about 15 minutes in the sugar and they released a lot of liquid in that time and I was afraid it would make the cream runny but it was fine. Next time I'll kind of combine everything quicker or I may mix the sugar with the sour cream next time and just stir in some sliced strawberries. Still I liked this a lot. Thanks jazmin!",
