My only problem was I had to fight w/ my blender just to to get it to blend everything together.  I could eventually get it done, but it just took forever.  My sister finally told me that my problem was that I didn't have any liquid to help the blender process the ingredients.  So I've started adding 3/4 cups of pineapple juice to the recipe and voila!  No more fighting with my blender and the pineapple juice makes the smoothie even tastier!  Thanks for a great recipe, Janet.",

I have a vitamix so I don't have to add liquid.  I do love this smoothie with pineapple juice as a few people have figured out.  I wouldn't say you need to measure anything just try variations and find what you love.  These are so healthy it feels good to drink them.  I never thought of adding yogurt or milk, but I'm glad people like it that way too.  For me the greener the better.  Plus my husband and son were both forced at first to try them and now they love them.  Thanks everyone.",

I found that the banana I used was quite sweet so I didn't even need to use the honey. Next time I'll be adding blueberries to the mix along with some flax seed. Thank you so much Janet!",

You can add more depending on the consistency you want. I add the yogurt and milk to make it more filling and to hold me over til lunch. I love this recipe because Im always so hungry in the morning and I usually gravitate towards heavy foods like pancakes or eggs and bacon. If you drink this you immediately feel better about yourself its filling so your not hungry two hours later and it makes you more cautious about the food you continue to eat throughout the day. And btw the honey kills the spinach taste so dont be nervous or put off!",
