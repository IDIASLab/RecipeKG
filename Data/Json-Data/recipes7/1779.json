I can not recall any holiday where I've subjected myself to consuming this gooey orange colored mass of spices. However, my family LOVES pumpkin pie, and since I play chef every Thanksgiving...I thought I'd give this recipe a trial run before the eating extravaganza comes around this year. I had to taste test of course...what a tasty crunchy explosion of fall flavor! Not only was it simple to put together, but it was terribly yummy. I'm looking forward to unveiling this pumpkin-pie treasure this coming holiday season... I may even pair it with some Jeni's \"Maker's Mark/Buttered Pecan\" icecream to make for a decadant pie ala mode. ",

My only caution would be to watch the pecans closely as they can burn before you know it.  Also, after making this recipe several times know, I find that my oven needs another 20 minutes or so.  If you know your oven takes longed I would wait to add the pecans for 30 minutes.  Also good with a walnut and pecan mix on top.",
