There is quite a bit of topping on this dessert, so the next time I make it, I am going to add another cup of peaches to mix.  We enjoyed this best, served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Although, my DH did enjoy it a room temp for breakfast the next morning.  This is a great recipe, and will be made again with fresh rhubarb about in season.",
