(My family is German, Irish, and Czech and the recipe likely came from the German and Irish side of the family.) I'm not sure if the recipe author forgot to write this step but we always shred the cabbage and salt it and let it wilt before adding the dressing. We've tweaked it slightly but the flavor remains constant. We now use partially non-fat yogurt to save on calories and the rest mayo. Another idea is that if seeds present an annoyance to perhaps folks with braces or people fussy about their teeth there is such a thing as ground celery seed that is available and we now use that every time we make coleslaw. If ground celery seed is unavailable you could always grind the seed yourself in a coffee grinder dedicated to spices alone.",
