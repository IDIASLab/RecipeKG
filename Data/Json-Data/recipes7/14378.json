I wish I would have melted the butter and poured over top, but it was so soft I had lots of tiny slivers of butter everywhere. I had to bake my cake for a much longer time, but I might have used more gelatin than called for. So I just baked it until it was \u201cset\u201d and golden. Family loved it!!  I will make this again!",

I\u2019d actually give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I used probably 1/8 of a cup of sugar mixed in with my strawberries and rhubarb and that was perfect!  I also had to bake probably 25-28 minutes until set which is shocking as I usually have to cut bake times with my oven as it\u2019s so hot/powerful.  I checked it initially at 15 minutes, thinking it would totally be done & surprisingly, it was not.  I would make again when I am looking for a simple, quick seasonal dessert.",
