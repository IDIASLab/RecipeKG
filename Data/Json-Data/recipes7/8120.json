I made the dressing as-is, but used 1/2 fat free mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream because I tripled the recipe and ran out of mayo.  I stuck my finger in the dressing and tasted it . . . and I got a bit nervous because I wasn't sure this was going to work at all.  I almost threw it out but I decided to see it through as see where this recipe was going.  No turkey on hand, so I oven baked 3 large breasts with olive oil, salt, and pepper - about 30 minutes.  I also only had glazed walnuts, so I chopped them very fine, threw them in, and crossed my fingers that they wouldn't be too sweet.  I held my breath and pulled it all together.  WOW!  WOW!! WOW!!!  I'm telling you - the pop of the curry, the zing of the vinegar, the bite of the red onion, the sweet of the fruit, and the salty-peppery chicken was AMAZING.  The glazed walnuts added a fun \"nut candy\" effect that we loved.  It is a bit of work to put this together, so make sure you make ALOT of it so you can enjoy it more than once.  I have a little left over and can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have really had a chance to blend.  Thank you SKYBLUE1963!!",
