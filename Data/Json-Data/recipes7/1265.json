                "reviewBody": "AWESOME!!! Made a few adjustments based on preference and what I had in my spice cabinet... VERY forgiving:) Instead of ancho chile powder (only had regular) I put a large whole dried ancho chile used fresh rosemary cut nutmeg and allspice to 1 TS (instead of 1 TB) each and added 1 TS corriander... Not sure why thyme's listed twice...? I just put the 1st amt since too much thyme can be overpowering maybe the 2nd was supposed to say oregano??? Anyhow just skipped that part... everything else according to recipe. Blended it all in the food processor til it was even makes A LOT! I only used 1/2 of it on a full rack of ribs; peeled membrane soaked 30 mins in apple cider vinegar worcestershire splash of liquid smoke (DO THIS! makes ribs super tender and juicy!) then patted dry and rubbed GENEROUSLY. Wrapped in foil only marinated 4 hours will do overnight next time! Baked them at 200 for 2 hours (meaty side down!) removed from foil and finished off on the grill with a bourbon molasses glaze and it was SO GOOD!!! LOVE the herbiness of the rosemary & thyme with the sweet of the sugars and glaze... GREAT alternative to standard BBQ ribs. Thanks CC Ryder!!!",

I will caution any newbie 'rub'-ers out there: 1) Using table salt is a no-no - the coarse salt used in the recipe should be measured. Substituting the same amount of fine table salt will leave you with an unpleasantly salty rub. 2) If you are not smoking then as a bare minimum slow cook for at least 4 hours with this rub. I tried the first batch for 3 hours in a slow oven and the pepper was still overwhelming. Another hour and the heat seemed to 'melt' into the other flavours. 3) Another good reason to go slow (4 hours) with this rub is it will force you go 'low' in terms of temperature. This rub has a lot of sugar and will burn at higher temperatures. As an inexperienced bbq'r from up north i gotta say this recipe got me rave reviews. It was well worth fiddling with the timing to get a smokerless version that worked in my slow-cooker/oven. God Bless America.",

AND ya gotta remove the membrane on the back of the babybacks or the flavor won't get to the back of the rib. I use a needle-nose pliers (clean well before and after!). I wash the ribs and dry them well before applying rub cover with saran wrap and let sit in the frig for 24-48 hours before smoking. Take a gander at my finished photo. Beautiful! I use a great dipping sauce made from Trader Joe's Sweet and Smoky Sauce Frank's Red Hot Sauce and Cholula Chipotle Hot Sauce; each guest gets a warmed bowl of sauce to dip as needed but sauce is NOT necessary! We smoked the ribs for about 4.5 hours we do not like it to fall off the bone but be more firm. You can also use this rub for a full pork tenderloin and smoke it...YUMMY!",
