I used about 1.5 pounds of ground beef upped the cloves of garlic to 4 added salt and pepper to taste used about 1 tablespoon of oregano used 2 stalk of celery and the mushrooms. I didn't bother with the sugar or baking soda (because i didn't feel the need to) My tomato can was only 796 ml so i added in 3 chopped fresh tomatoes as well. Also swapped monterey jack cheese for the Parmesan. I cooked my beef first and then drained the fat and set aside while i cooked the vegetables. Also waked up the tomato paste a bit in the pan with the vegetables before adding the beef back in and the tomatoes. GREAT dish thanks for sharing!!!",
