However while I really like the crunchiness and texture of the topping I really disliked the taste. Particularly I thought it tasted too much like the active yeast. Meanwhile my partner thought the sugar made the topping too sweet. I'll definitely make this again but with adjustments to the topping. Thanks for sharing this! Our grocery store always runs out of these and I'm happy to be able to make them at home.",
