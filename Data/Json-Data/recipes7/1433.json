This is a favorite in my family, and we have it for breakfast every Easter Sunday with the eggs we've colored. This Easter bread is especially tasty because it has a faint hint of lemon in it. My favorite way to eat it is warmed up, with butter spread on top.",

To color the uncooked eggs I covered them with food coloring and let them sit for a few minutes to let the color set in. Then I rinsed the extra color off.

This morning I sliced a piece off and toasted and it was just as yummy as last night. Never tried baking eggs before but they turned out perfect also.
