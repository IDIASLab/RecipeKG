Crispy on the outside soft buttery and flaky on the inside couldn't get any better texture wise! I made the buttermilk with lemon juice and milk as I wanted more of a lemon flavor. And they baked for 25 minutes in my oven. I didn't add the nuts either so I used extra cranberries and served with a dollop of lemon curd. One tip make sure to space them out at least two inches on the baking sheet as they spread and puff up quite a bit. You might want to make two batches as these will go fast!",
