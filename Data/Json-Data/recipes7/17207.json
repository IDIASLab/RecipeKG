It was not runny at all. I put the cinnamon stick in right at the beginning and the flavor is still mild. I heard the beep when it was done and didn't have time to get to the pot for 40 minutes. Once I started stirring they smashed very easily and no immersion blender was necessary. I only saut\u00e9ed for maybe 2 minutes and it was thick. At first I gave this 4 stars as it was pretty good warm when I tried it. However I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it is just one big clump. This recipe needs more orange juice; all others recipes I've looked at call for more liquid.",
