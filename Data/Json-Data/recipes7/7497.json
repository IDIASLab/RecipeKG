BTW, you can substitute zucchini for the apples if you want  for a variation.\nAPPLE BREAD\n\n3 c. all-purpose flour, 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. baking soda, 1 t. salt, 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 2 eggs, 2 c. sugar, 2 c. finely chopped or shredded peeled apple or unpeeled zucchini, 1/2 c. cooking oil, 1 c. chopped walnuts or pecans, toasted in pan in 350 degree oven for 5 min. (OPTIONAL, but very good, 2 1/2 T. milk (enough to moisten).  Mix eggs, oil, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking powder, & soda.  Add flour, apples, milk, nuts.  Mix till all is blended.  Pour into (non-stick if you have them) loaf pans that have been generously sprayed with cooking spray, so bread won't stick.  Sprinkle the top of each loaf with 1 t. sugar.  (Makes a fancy looking wonderful top crust; I do on all my quick bread recipes).  Pour into two 8\"x4\" loaf pans and bake for about 50 min or til tests done when a toothpick inserted comes out clean.  Over the top goodness, plenty sweet enough, and so much healthier for you with half the fat and 1/3 less cholesterol.  \n\nAlso, I used smaller pans (5 3/4\" x 3\" x 2 1/8\"), cause it takes less baking time.  I baked them for 35 - 40 min. or until tested done with toothpick.  Makes 3 to 4 loaves, depending on how high of a loaf you want.  I usu. double this recipe and make 7, so can freeze & give away some.",

Like most I cut the recipe in half and I use 1/2cup whole wheat flour and 1cup+2tbl Swans Down cake flour. Wheat flour is very low in protein resulting in those heavy breads. Cake flour has the highest protein so it compensates for the whole wheat.\n\nI also did the combo of white/brown sugars.\nInstead of the oil I used 6 tablespoons melted butter. Again, some protein and not as heavy as oil which makes for a better texture for the leftovers too.\nI rough chopped the 2cups of apples then tossed in lemon water to keep them white.\nThat's why in spite of the wheat flour this bread isn't dark.\nI tossed the apples with it's own flour in a colander to keep the chunks suspended in the bread not sink to the bottom.\n\nI sprinkled the dough with a touch of white sugar before tossing in the oven and it gives a nice thin crisp glossy crust but isn't a streusel. Um, I used 3/4 cup rough chopped pecans & 1/4 tsp of vanilla.\nOh, Granny Smith apples.\nSo, this recipe was really a joint effort with everybody who wrote and as the picture shows it came out pretty, fluffy and light. I put the cup next to it to show the height of the cake.\nThe adding of the wheat flour really added a lovely sweet wheat taste and I never would have thought of it. Thanks everybody, this tastes great.",

As Jillian suggested, I did half white sugar and half brown and added a generous teaspoon of vanilla extract and nutmeg.  It turned out heavenly!  I used an apple corer/peeler tool and chopped the apples into smaller pieces from there.  I didn't puree the apples in a mini food processor like I do for zucchini bread; I left them chunky and it turned out amazing.  I made two loaves as the recipe is written, as a reviewer recommended I baked at 350 F for 1 hour and it was perfect. Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe, I will definitely be making this again!",
