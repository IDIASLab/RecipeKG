I made two gallons one jar cut into spears and the other cut into thick slices. I like the slices better and they were to my liking after only five days. I am going to experiment with about half the sugar and a little less garlic next time. The Tabasco is perfect though. I processed some of the finished pint jars in a boiling water bath for ten minutes so I can keep them longer. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

I just made my 2nd batch the other day. I did make a couple of changes...I used the sliced dill pickles. I used about 5-6 oz of jalapeno juice instead of tabasco. (from a jar of pickled jalapeno's)I also added about 1 1/2 cups of sliced jalapeno's (I had to remove some pickles to make room.) 4 1/2 cups of sugar was all I used as well. These were so crisp! I've had several requests for the recipe. These are excellent with grilled cheese sandwiches and burgers.",
