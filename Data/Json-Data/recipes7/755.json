I used 1 T oil instead of 1/3 cup since I wasn't putting it on the grill and I'm working off those Christmas pounds. I cubed the chicken and seared it in a nonstick pan with Pam. I served it on top of grilled sweet onions red and yellow peppers and fresh tomatoes. With some brown rice on the side it was pretty ANd tasty AND healthy. My husband who prefers not to experiment even liked it. I only have one regret: that I didn't take a picture to post because it was so pretty.",
