It was the ugliest thing I'd ever made! I ended up cutting off the high edges to make it level, then covered the top with a chocolate ganache. Everyone loved it! I've made it two times since and it has turned out beautifully each time. Don't overbeat your cheesecake, and bake it in a water bath (see instructions on baking a cheesecake). The ganache is still a nice complement--scald a cup of heavy cream, then pour it over 1 1/2 cups of chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 5 mins, then stir until melted. Add 1 tsp. of vanilla, stir, and pour /spread on top of cheesecake.",

I went to Starbucks and asked for a quadruple shot of espresso, used 1/4 cup for the recipe, then froze the rest in an ice cube tray to use for iced mochas.  I baked it in a water bath, and when the hour was up, I turned off the oven and left the cheescake in the oven to cool for a few hours.  Absolutely no cracks!  I made it a couple of days ahead so the flavors had time to mature, and served it with drizzled caramel and whipped cream, just like in the picture.",

The richness and creaminess of the cheesecake is well...as one of my guests put it \"to die for\".  I always bring my ingredients to room temperature before mixing and don't overbeat - plus do a waterbath to avoid cracks.  I topped it with homemade whipped cream and it was beyond delicious!

I took the suggestion of placing the springform pan on a muffin tin pan filled with water, and I left it in the oven a few hours after turning it off. It turned out perfectly!  So smooth and cream, no cracks, and a wonderful blend of flavors!  \n\nI topped with homemade caramel - melt 1 stick butter and 1 C brown sugar, boiling about 5 minutes until smooth.  Turn off heat and add 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla and enough evaporated milk until it reaches desired consistency - about 1/2 cup (will thicken as it cools).",

                "reviewBody": "I have a few problems with this recipe.  First, if you have it without the caramel, you can taste the coffee.  It's a delicate flavor but definitely there.  To achieve this flavor I bought some decaf french roast and double brewed it on the strong setting.  (I am sensitive to caffeine but love the flavor of coffee.)  But once you add the caramel, it overpowers the flavor and it's much harder to taste.  Second, the baking time is wrong.  I've made cheesecakes a few times and usually I bake at 350 for 40-50 minutes.  But given that the ingredients in this one had added liquid from coffee and a full cup of sour cream, I thought I should do as the author instructed and did it at 325 for 1hr and 5 mins.  My cheesecake was overcooked.  A cheesecake should not appear browned anywhere and the top of mine was getting browned after an hour.  I did bake it in a water bath, even with that I had this odd experience of it not sinking in the middle but rather it was high along the edge with a dip just inside that then rose to the center. I also did everything I could not to over beat. The cheesecake was also not smooth and creamy - perhaps this was in part due to being over baked.  For my preference, the crust is also double what I needed.  What saved this for me was the caramel sauce, but mine was not store bought.  With the addition of a nice caramel sauce, I would give it 3 stars.  As written it is a 2 star recipe.  It sounds nice, but falls short of what it promises.",
