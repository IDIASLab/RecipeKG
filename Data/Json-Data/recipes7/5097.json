        "description": "This is a sauce I created and have used for a long time. It is commonly known around here as 'My-Oh-Yeah Sauce.' It goes great with pork or beef. It works especially well poured over spare ribs and slow cooked in a slow cooker until the meat is falling off the bones. Best to par-boil or pre-bake the ribs a bit, or the fat from the ribs turns the barbecue sauce into a delicious but very thin soup. This is the first time I have actually written down this recipe. I believe the amounts to be accurate, but I do like my sauce sweet. I always say it is better to start small. You can always add easier than you can take away.",

Followed the recipe to the letter tasted it and then made adjustments to suit our personal taste. Thought the molasses dominated way too much so I would cut that back in the future as well as the sugar. Wanted more of a pop of spicy flavor so I added a healthy dose of hot sauce (instead of more cayenne) which brought it up to speed for us. Seriously I was expecting a sauce that had an Asian tang to it but the hoisin and oyster sauces were lost IMO. Finally the recipe doesn t call for heating the sauce and after stirring for a long time the consistency still was granular so I heated for a while allowing the sugar to dissolve. None of this is to discourage any of you from trying this recipe. Again we all have different tastes this one was a bit too sweet for us but may be exactly what you are looking for. My rating is based on the tweaks I made.",
