I knew I wanted to make something like this- I had a graham cracker crust strawberries and whipping cream and an impromptu cookout with the neighbors in 2 hours. This worked perfectly. I made the following modifications: I didn't have unflavored gelatin so I used strawberry flavored. I also really wanted more strawberry so added an additional half cup. The filling was then pink so I spread some plain white whipped topping on top and topped with some sliced decorative strawberries and sugar. The neighbors were quite impressed and happy with it. 2 hours was enough to mostly solidify it but more time would probably be better. I'll definitely make it again- it was cool and refreshing for a cookout.",
