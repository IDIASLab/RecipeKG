The crumb topping is an extra special touch. I found I liked it best with just a dollop of fresh whipped cream to complement the spicy pumpkin flavor. I didn't have Texas toast and substituted a loaf of regular sandwich bread, which when cubed equaled about 8 cups. I also took the crusts off first. The only minor issue was with mixing everything in the baking dish - that caused it to stick to the dish. I would recommend stirring the pumpkin mixture in a large bowl and adding the bread cubes to the bowl to mix, then pouring it all in the baking pan.",

                "reviewBody": "This was fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I made a couple of changes to try lightening it up and reducing the number of ingredients used: egg beaters instead of eggs, lower calorie/high-fiber white bread instead of the Texas toast,  2 heaping tsp of pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon/cloves/nutmeg combo, and reduced the amount of brown sugar in the topping to 1/4 cup.  I also added a little 2% milk to the pumpkin mixture so there was enough liquid to fully soak the bread.  Ended up with 12 generously-sized squares of french toast, at about 160 calories (and 10 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber!) a piece!  Turned out great, although I don't doubt the original recipe is even better and richer tasting - will save that for a special occasion :)  \n\nThe best part -- I wrapped the leftover squares individually in plastic wrap and froze them, and am looking forward to reheating them in the toaster oven for an easy/healthy breakfast later this week!",

For the topping, I used 3 tablespoons of butter and added approximately 1 cup of finely chopped pecans.  It is delish served alone or amazing with a smidgen of maple syrup and a dollop of Extra Creamy Cool Whip.  I placed the cubed bread into a 13x9 Pyrex dish and poured the puree on top and gently tossed with my hands; then sprinkled with the topping.

In step 3 of the directions it states, \" Arrange the bread cubes in a single layer\", so only a few slices of bread needed to be cubed.  I had cubed up the entire loaf since that is what is listed in the ingredient listing.  Also, I would suggest lining the cake pan with foil and geasing the foil, so clean-up of the pan is easier.  As another review suggested, mix the ingredients in a bowl and then pour the mixture over the bread cubes.",

I didn't have Texas toast bread. I made a loaf of homemade bread, the other day, and used that. I only wanted about 4 servings, or just enough for breakfast, and used about 7 slices of the cubed bread for 1/2 the recipe. The only other change I made was subbing an equal amount of \"pumpkin pie spice\" for the cloves and nutmeg. I would spray the baking pan well or line with parchment as it does stick a bit like most baked french toast recipes. When done I ate it with a very tiny drizzle of maple syrup. The crumb topping already gave it a unique light sweetness. It looks like bread pudding kind of, with the cubed bread, but tastes like french toast. It did smell good to.",

I mixed everything in a big bowl, added the bread tossed to coat then piled it in the pan. Somebody else mentioned that to do a single layer doesnt need a whole loaf, but you donty want just a single layer. just cut the whole loaf, coat then pile it all in, it will turn out perfect. Also no reason to add milk, the bread will soak up the mixture (per another reviewers comments, if you add milk or crean it will turn out like bread pudding and not a french toast bake, which is what it is)",

Also added a dash of skim milk just to moisten things up and glazed the baking dish with oil and maple syrup. Just because I wanted this a little more like bread pudding, I added 1/8cup of raisins and a handful of pecans for more texture and flavors.
