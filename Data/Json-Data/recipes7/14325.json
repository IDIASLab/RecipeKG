The durian was hydrated with a cup of hot water that was later used in the recipe. A bundt pan was used instead of a rectangular one. Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe and despite it being a first attempt at a steamed cake it turned out okay. We could taste the durian despite it having been dehydrated and the flavored water probably helped. After a day or two the cake slices needed to be reheated in a bath of water in order to become a dumpling consistency and edible. I wouldn't make it again.",
