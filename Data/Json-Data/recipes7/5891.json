We make ice pops out of them using dixie cups and popsicle sticks. All I do is just pour the mixture into the dixie cups about 1/2-3/4 cups full place the filled cups onto a flat baking sheet and freeze until just solid then stick the popsicle sticks in. For me Yoplait yogurt is near free seeing as I coupon and berries are cheap this time of year so it's not only economical but it's healthier than the Go-gurt pops that my kids love and it tastes better too! This works with just about any low-calorie/low-sugar yogurt or fruit you'd want to use AND it doubles/triples/quadruples really well. NOTE: I did NOT review this because it was similar to another recipe I have made before. I HAVE made this recipe many times and even though it's not technically \"frozen yogurt\" it makes great yogurt pops in the summer for the kiddos.",

I paid 4 for the vanilla yogurt just to make it which I don't normally buy. I really dislike when other people rate the recipe because they have made something they believe is similar. I only had the one review to go on. Either way I got a regular consistency blueberry smoothie from the recipe. It is typically how I would make many smoothies anyway. The smoothie isn't bad but I am rating a recipe for frozen yogurt. I did not deviate from this one so I don't know what happened.",

I found it to be so thick that my blender had a hard time chopping everything up so I added just a little skim milk to help it out. I'll probably use my food processor next time since it does a better job with this kind of thing. I could have eaten it straight from the blender and had \"frozen yogurt \" but I decided to put it in popsicle molds to share with my granddaughter. She loved it! (I used fat-free vanilla yogurt like what you buy in the dairy section NOT a frozen vanilla yogurt like ice cream)",
