Also delightful filled with salt-cured or smoked salmon and a dab of sour cream, garnished with fresh dill. Any fresh or smoked fish is good in blini. Rolled or folded around any kind of fish spread is delightful. And of course, the best of all is black caviar such as ossetra or beluga, and served with icy cold vodka as a snack or appetizer. Crumbled Bulgarian feta and chopped fresh dill is a tasty budget filling. Like other reviewers, I've used lemon juice in them. I strongly object to substituting oil for butter, reducing the amount of butter, or using any kind of reduced fat milk, which affects the flavor negatively. If you want to taste Eastern Europe when you eat them, follow the directions exactly.",

I made the following cahnges to lower the amount of fat and calories:1% milk instead of regular and I did not use any butter at all as I made them on VillaWare Crepe Maker that has a non-stick coating that requires no butter or cooking spray at all. Also very importantly instead of adding 1/8 citric acid powder I added a few drops of fresh lemon juice into the spoon with baking soda before adding it in just enough for the soda to bubble up - to eliminate the baking soda taste.",

Buttering each final blin is a good idea to keep them from drying out on the edges. Yes this recipe produces a TON of blini but they disappear quickly too. Lemon juice instead of citric acid powder works well and I felt that the sugar and salt amounts could have been doubled. They tasted under seasoned to me. I will make these again next time they will come out perfect. Serve them in true Russian fashion with honey or jam and sour cream or caviar.",
