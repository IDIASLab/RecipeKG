I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it 2 minutes, but it was too long for my microwave because the end product was a little tough. I just know to cut the time down next time. There's a fine line with mug cakes - too long and they're tough; not long enough and they're not done. It's just experimenting with my microwave to find out the perfect time. I do think all doughnuts should be glazed, so I added a powdered sugar glaze afterwards. Totally delicious!",

Here's what I did: substituted egg beaters for the egg and a heaping spoonful of Whitehouse chunky applesauce for the oil. other than that, I followed the recipe and it was perfect! I drizzled a little agave nectar on top, but I believe that this would have been just as good plain. The perfect Doughnut (or muffin) in a mug !",
