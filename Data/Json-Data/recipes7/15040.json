I\u2019ve never been to an authentic Chinese food restaurant that uses breast meat over dark but that\u2019s an argument for another day. I also drastically reduced the amount of pepper (especially the white pepper). It does taste good with the full amount of pepper but I have young children whose pallets aren\u2019t quite up to the kick yet. Definitely a make again",
