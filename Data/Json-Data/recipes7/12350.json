My avocado was a little less ripe than ideal so I had to transfer the wet ingredients to my food processor to really pur\u00e9e the avocado and eliminate any sign of green chunks.  I subbed oat flour for 1/2 c of the white and almond flour for 1/4 c, which upped the nutritional value without impacting texture of taste.  I also reduced the brown sugar from 3/4 c to 1/2 c.  The whole family likes these, I think they will become a staple for us!  Thank you",
