                "reviewBody": "A nice flavor and not very complicated. I made a few \"additions\" to the recipe. 1) Seasoning the cavity I doubled the Chinese 5 Spice. It really needs some additional spice and it is still there when you later boil the carcass for broth! I also added about 3 oz of dried Cranberries to the mix of Orange and Onion. 2) I used dried Cranberries... whole cranberries are seasonal so you have to make due... 6 oz plus 1 cup of water to re-hydrate and cook... time to cook is increased to about 15 minutes for the glaze. I assumed the orange zest goes in the glaze... it is not listed. I added a tablespoon of 5 spice to the glaze. 3) I slit the skin (but not the meat) every inch or so to help with the glaze flavor getting into the meat. I also held back about 1/2 cup of the glaze mixture for garnish at the table. It is surprisingly tasty as a side or with the meat. 4) I put about 2 cups of chicken broth in the bottom of the roasting pan to help humidify the oven and prevent the duck drippings from being a blackened char. Although I prefer a stuffed bird (because I LOVE stuffing) this was a nice change of pace with all the wonderful flavors of duck and fruit coming together.",
