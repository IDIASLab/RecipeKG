You could start with 2 tbl and move up to 1/4 cup if you want it sweeter. You can add rice flour or cornstarch and it will be creamier and pourable. If you make it in a blender it stays homogenized and will not separate for a fairly long time. (the mustard is an emulsifier) Onion powder garlic powder and dry mustard can be substituted and seem to make the dressing more stable. This is very close to the famous \"Dorothy Lynch\" dressing in Nebraska and Iowa which also has celery seeds.",

I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic paste. Also I live in a small town and could not find onion juice so I used a teaspoon of onion powder. I'm not sure if onion juice is made any more. Anyway the dressing was tasty except next time I think I'll use less sugar. I was a little sweet. Overall I liked the dressing.",
