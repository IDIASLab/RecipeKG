I did have some pomegranate juice in the fridge which I added to red wine vinegar which I think was fine. IMO unless you're a pomegranate-infused red wine vinegar lover I think you'll be happy just with a good-quality red wine vinegar. We had this salad (which I served chilled) with some grilled jalape\u00f1o chicken sausages and really enjoyed it. And I agree with the recipe author it would be a good addition to a Mexican meal. Good balance of sweet sour and spicy.",

Second I was leery of something calling itself a salad - but you have to boil it for 25 minutes in 1 cup of vinegar and lastly...why would I want to boil the delicate flavor of roasted red peppers in vinegar and hot spices for 25 minutes? So I proceeded with low expectations. Bottom line is - this is ok and some might like it. Better name for this recipe would be 'Corn with a Kick.' Not my taste.",
