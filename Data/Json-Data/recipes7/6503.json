I first learned about falafel from a Lebanese student in my class but for years relied on packaged mix (never as good!).  Another great twist is to buy whole spices and grind them your self - it only adds 2 minutes to prep time but the flavors are so much more vivid.  Also you can finely chop a bit of cilantro or parsley into the mixture.  These make great finger food for parties too!",

After 6 hours of soaking I thought I'd better cook them since they were still pretty crispy. BAD idea. They absorbed too much water and when I tried to cook them I ended up with falafel mush and had to throw it all out. The flavor was excellent and I'm going to try this again.  But there's no way I'll cook them and I'd warn people away from using canned beans for the same reason",

The baking soda is used to soften the beans and the baking powder is to make the falafel light and airy so I recommend using both.  I let the beans soak overnight and also had to use a bit more water to get the right consistency.  Much more authentic than any recipe that calls for cooked garbanzo beans.  Excellent flavor.

Doubled the recipe, still didn't make enough because there was such demand.  Got rave reviews from a die-hard falafel fan who had repeatedly tried and failed to make it herself.  I did once make falafel-flavored oil by using canned garbanzos and now know that because those are cooked, not just soaked, the starches could no longer (re)bind to each other causing it to fall instantly apart when cooked.  The ground and spiced mixture actually sat in the refrigerator 3 days (one more than the recommended max) but that was fine.  I did use the soda to help the chickpeas soak efficiently (if you skip it, increase the time), and I used the baking powder but not sure how much that really helped the final fluffiness.  I may have over-rolled the balls - they can be pretty large and loose (which means air pockets of fluffy goodness) so long as you're slow and careful getting them into the oil, which if hot and deep enough will instantly sear the outside to prevent disintegration.  Use no more than medium heat so the skillet isn't much hotter than the oil and if possible use infrared thermometer to ensure that the oil is at least 375 before dropping in the balls (which I made slightly larger than ping pong size).  Cooler oil will mess up the texture (as well as risk disintegration) and a hotter pan will burn part of the 'shell'.  I'm now headed to the market for more chickpeas...",

That said, I had to add more water than was stated to get a good blend. I let it sit overnight and it was still watery. I rolled each patty in bread crumbs and fried them in about 1/4\" of vegetable oil. They came out PERFECTLY considering it was my first time and I had to improvise a bit! My kids (ages 7-13) loved it! There were no leftovers! There was the right amount of crisp on the outside. After I fried each, I let the oil drip onto a paper bag then transferred to the serving plate. Then I sprinkled with a little Kosher salt. For those deathly afraid of frying (like myself), I used less oil than was called for. I cooked on low-medium heat. And I used a flat spatula to slip each patty into the oil.",
