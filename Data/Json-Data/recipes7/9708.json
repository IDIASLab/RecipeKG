Otherwise I followed the recipe. These baked for exactly 25 minutes and I got 16 muffins. I'd imagine that rather than the mayonnaise that you could use yogurt or sour cream and next time I'll try white whole wheat flour. These are ingredients I always have on hand so whenever I have ripe bananas I now have several healthy muffins to choose from. Thank you so much Happy Mama.",

Prepared almost exactly to specifications (used fewer nuts and cut them quite fine to make consumption easier for my grandson), this is proof positive that chocolate chip muffins can be both delicious and nutritious, and they won praise from everyone who sampled them - senior citizen, toddler, and even the nutritionist daughter.  Moist, not overly sweet, and packing a bit of crunch,  these are sturdy enough to travel well in a lunchbox, backpack or briefcase for a tasty and healthy snack.  The recipe makes 12 standard sized muffins and freezes well.",
