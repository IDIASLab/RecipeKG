I can see using this with all kinds of fillings, cherry, cream cheese, cinnamon and sugar. when it came out my daughter and husband each had 3 pieces. In less than 15 minutes ONE was gone. It took over 3 hours, the only downer here. The bread was so delish, light and fluffy. I think I might try semi sweet chips instead of all the chopping of squares. Maybe chips with apricot, yum!!! this was a super hit. WELL WELL WORTH THE WORK!!\nShowstopping. Couldnt even get a picture of them, they disappeared so fast.  Yeast breads\ncan sometimes be tricky for some. This made two fat little rings that never stopped doubling. But this is a no brainer.  WONDERFUL!!! 5 stars for sure.",
