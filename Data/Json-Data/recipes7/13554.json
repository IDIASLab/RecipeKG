The taco seasoning in the packet is mostly salt, and other non-natural ingredients that humans should not consume like monosodium glutamate (MSG which is a flavor enhancer). The cheese has enough sodium to meet the daily allowance. Instead of the seasoning packet, I added chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Instead of Ro-Tel, I diced roma tomatoes and chilies. It was delicious and with all the spices, my husband did not notice that salt was not added. I would definitely make this again.",

I flattened two BLSL chicken breasts coated them with the taco seasoning pan fried them in olive oil removed them from the pan chopped them up and covered them to keep them warm and moist.

I avoided the oil and just added everything into the pan and cooked it, and didn't have a problem with anything sticking.  The Rotel Original was a bit spicy for the family, so next will also use mild.  My husband doesn't like sour cream, so those who wanted it just added it on top.
