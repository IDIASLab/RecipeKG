Added 1 extra banana, 1 tsp of banana extract, 1 tsp of coconut extract, a pinch of orange rind, cranraisins and golden raisins and then added walnuts, pecans and macademia nuts. On a side note for the second batch:  The addition of a 3rd banana meant having to cook it a little longer.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!",

My family is not a fan of coconut so I left it out. (Shame on them. I'm going to go ahead and add it next time they can stick it.) I made no other changes. I did cover it halfway through with foil to keep it from burning. So so good. The combination of all those flavors was off the hook. Scotdog you were dead on girl. This one's a keeper!",

I was perhaps, a little conservative with the ingredients...it wouldn't have hurt to add more coconut and a little more brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg. (I'm famous for not exactly measuring ingredients, haha my fault) I didn't have any walnuts so I made it without. Husband and roommate both said they were delicious, especially with butter. It was a tad bit difficult to gauge the cooking time, but it was around 40 minutes for 12 muffins. The insides came clean off the toothpick, but upon the first taste, the muffin still seemed kind of mushy. I learned that the inside will firm up as it cools.",

I goofed and mixed up the flour amounts and so did 2 c whole wheat and 1 c white and I made one loaf with nuts and the other without and both without coconut (trying to please the extended family's tastes). They turned out great. I found that when the toothpick came out clean though it could have used a little more cooking time so next time I'll use the method where you touch the top of the bread and it's done if it springs back up quickly.

Just make sure they are evenly spaced in the oven and check for doneness with a toothpick a little sooner than you would with the larger loaves.\n\nNext time I may leave some of those ingredients out and try fresh chopped cranberries (for a little tartness and maybe substitute a little grated carrot for some of the  zuchini just for a little change-up\n\n**Btw if zucchini is on sale or you just happen to have a lot on hand, grate it and freeze in 2 1/2 c portions to be ready to bake the next batch.
