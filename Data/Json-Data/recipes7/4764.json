Much better when fresh. Unfortunately as a little goes a long way, it usually takes me months to go through half a bottle but mom is right so I usually buy the smallest bottle I can find and keep them for only a month or two. I also cut down on the amount in this recipe to 2 tbs.",

If you're concerned about it add extra lime and extra sugar. I often serve it as a party appetizer scooped on top of tortilla chips. Everyone loves it.",
