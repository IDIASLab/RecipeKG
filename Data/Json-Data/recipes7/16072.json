So I used about 1 cup of cold brew cubes (no regular ice cubes)and 1/2 c non-frozen coconut milk. It still came out creamy and icy. I added about 1 tsp coconut extract just to bring that flavor through more. I used a packet of sweet-n-low instead of sugar. The chocolate and caramel syrups on top really made the drink and lastly I sprinkled on some toasted coconut flakes.
