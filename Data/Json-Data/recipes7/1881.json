First of all you really should use fresh fruit not frozen. Also you need sugar and some type of flavoring both for the berry mixture and the cream mixture. Otherwise it really is quite bland. I found Grand Marnier was the perfect flavor to complement the berries much better than coffee liqueur would be. With those changes it was a hit both times I've made it so far.
