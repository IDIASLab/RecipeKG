It's like a combination of a soft-brownie-cakey-chocolate-chip-cookie with a bit of a creamy texture inside. It tastes good warm, as all melted chocolate desserts do, but even better cooled. My daughters couldn't wait to eat, so good luck holding out for it to cool.",

I started off with just two VERY stale chocolate croissants (still not sure how they didn't get eaten fresh) so I halved the recipe and made sure the cut-up croissants got a good half hour in the custard before baking.

Since I didn't have a whole vanilla bean I used about 2 tsp. of vanilla bean paste and since that has sugar in it I reduced the added sugar as well. Wonderful flavor and texture.",
