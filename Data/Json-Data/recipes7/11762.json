I followed the recipe as written with the exception of straining the spices through a cheesecloth since I didn't have one on hand and the coffee filter method failed. I brewed some espresso in my machine and made an iced pumpkin spice latte with the same measurements as the popular coffee houses and it turned out perfecto! One word of caution is this recipe makes a large amount, you may want to consider cutting the recipe in half or more.",

So much nicer than the McDonalds and Starbucks versions I've tried.\nI used 2 tsp of ground ginger and cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of gr. cloves & a generous sprinkle of pumpkin pie Spice and also substituted canned pure pumpkin rather than the \"already\" spiced pumpkin pie filling, as its considerably cheaper in the grocery store, and just added extra spice to make up for it.   I love that the syrup lasts for a couple weeks in the fridge,  so you can make and share them easily within minutes. Will keep this recipe in mind during the Christmas season.",

Starbucks has a chemically taste to me (likely from preservatives) and is too heavy on the hot spices- cloves ginger etc). I made a few adjustments- I omitted the fresh ginger at the beginning because I'm not a huge fan of ginger and knew I would get enough with the pumpkin pie spice. I didn't have pumpkin pie filling so I just used canned pumpkin but added an additional half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp total). I also divided the sugar by using 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and it gave it a rich yummy caramel taste! I used 2 tablespoons syrup with 2 shots espresso 8 ounces steamed milk for a delicious beverage- about the same sweetness as starbucks but not the bitter aftertaste. Thanks so much for this recipe!",
