The reason I gave it 4 starts was because I used it as a 2nd layer on top of a regular baked pumpkin pie. So the bottom regular baked pie gave it more substance & weight as a whole pie. This filling was like a heavy flavored whip cream layer. Everyone loved it definitely will be making this 2 layer pumpkin pie.",

I made it as written except that I used my usual pumpkin pie spices (1-1/2 t cinnamon 3/4 t ginger 3/4 t nutmeg 1/4 t cloves)instead of \"pumpkin pie spice\" and extra cinnamon. It needs more sugar. I might make again but I will try 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the pumpkin mix in addition to the sugar in the whipped cream. Nicer flavor than the awful cool whip versions of this pie.",
