I've been eyeing this recipe ever since it was published, but with all the fun add-ins, I never really thought I'd have everything around to make them! Then last evening, when my sister and I were trying to come up with something sweet to bring to a church function, we found that we had every single ingredient and could make these exactly as written. They came out perfectly delicious! I would definitely make these cookies again. My sister and I both thought that the addition of raisins would be a good touch, to give them a bit more chewiness. \nFor those who thought the dough was very dry: it works best to mix the butter mixture into the flour mixture with your hands. This is a trick I learned in culinary school; your hands are the most effective tool for mixing and combining.\nThanks so much for sharing this recipe; it is a winner and we'll be making them again!",

To correct and circumvent that potential issue I reduced the flour by a full cup and in doing so I noticed right away the dough seemed just right. The resulting cookies were too - full of a variety of flavors and textures they were satisfying with every rich buttery bite. (Note: In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards I omitted the coconut and I think the cookies were better without it anyway)",
