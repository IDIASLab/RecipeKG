So I made my own tomato paste with one skinned medium Roma tomato, then I substituted Hoisin sauce for fish sauce, I used 2 tablespoons of red curry paste and no curry powder, and finally, I used parsley in place of basil for the fresh component. I want to try the recipe as is, but even with the subs, it was still fantastic. The calorie count for the dish, per serving, with my subs is 310 calories, just FYI.",

My usual curry powder doesn't have that cardamom which adds such a special flavor and aroma to this particular blend. I did omit the fish sauce. I thought the sauce was divine with the squash. I will be using this same sauce with all types of other vegetables and proteins in the future. Very satisfying dish for a cold winter night.",
