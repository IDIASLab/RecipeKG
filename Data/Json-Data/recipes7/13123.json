This produces a wet dough that you will need to flour your hands, rolling pin and table in order to roll out. this will make about 4 fry breads approximately 8 inches across. Everybody loved them and everyone was satisfied with just one bread loaded up with browned hamburger spiced up with salt, pepper, dark chili powder, dried onion, garlic, and taco seasoning. We used Rotel onion and peppers, refried beans, cheese of course, hot sauce and sour cream to complete the meal. My grandson is learning how to cook and this was a meal that we made together for the family.",

I doubled the recipe since I had a 1 kg package of ground beef I used 2 cups of home made kidney beans and 2 cups of home made baked beans I added 1/4 tsp salt since mine are salt free and used 4 tbsps of home made salt free taco seasoning.
