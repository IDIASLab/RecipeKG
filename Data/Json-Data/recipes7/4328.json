                "reviewBody": "Made this for our church Thanksgiving pie social. It was not a hit. Even though it was labeled Caramel Cranberry Apple Pie the cranberries looked like raisins which does not look appetizing in an apple pie. (All the pies were cut up and served on plates). Also because I sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on the top crust as the directions say the cinnamon made the pie look burnt or dirty. I think overall the flavor of the pie was fine it was more aesthetic problems and I made a pretty pie. I didn't make the lattice top instead I cut out about 30-40 small maple leafs out of the dough and laid them on top in a pattern leaving room for the filling to bubble up. I got lots of compliments on that. So if you are going to make this pie my biggest recommendation would be to add the extra cinnamon to the apples not to the top crust. I would still sprinkle the sugar on the top which is what I do to all of my covered fruit pies. I think the cinnamon on the top was the biggest issue with the cranberries looking like raisins being the 2nd.. I personally think a regular apple pie is still better than a caramel cranberry apple; I will be sticking to my go-to apple pie recipe from \"The Joy Of Cooking.\"",
