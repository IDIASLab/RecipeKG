I had to use a bit more flour but that is a variable that changes with so many factors anyway.  I add flour until the dough feels right, not exactly as called for.  I ended up letting the dough mix in the mixer for about 7 minutes total between low to medium speed.  The dough was a soup before adding the rest of the called for flour.  I added some milk to the melted butter to brush the rolls.  My last proof time was less than called for and the rolls continued to puff up while cooking.  I hand shaped them and baked on silicone mats (see the picture I posted).  I made 10 rolls that fit burgers well.  These are not flaky like store bought rolls but they are an even better texture, reminiscent of pizza rolls (gluten formation dependent on mixing times).  They are fairly light and springy.  Although they puffed a bit tall, they compress easily when biting.",

A favorite for Hamburgers and Hot Dogs.\n\nI make the dough in my bread machine, following manufacturer's instructions for order of ingredients.  (Hint:  I always sprinkle the sugar over the flower, dividing the salt on either end of pan, and putting the yeast in an indentation in the center.  The sugar aids the yeast, but the salt will kill yeast if it touches it.)\n   I shape the 12 rolls for King Arthur's Hamburger-Roll pans which have been greased with Crisco shortening.  AFTER the rolls have risen to a large size, I carefully brush the tops with a mixture of 1 Tablespoon Milk, 1 Egg Yolk, beaten, and 1/4 teaspoon Salt using a Fan Art Brush.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until tops are light golden.",
