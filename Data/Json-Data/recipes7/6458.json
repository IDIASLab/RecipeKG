This makes a huge pie, so thank goodness my springform pan is oversized. Using the frozen bread dough made this recipe super easy- and to make it seem a little more like homemade I brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled a little parmesan and seasoning on while baking it. The filling was perfect and everything tasted great as reheated leftovers in the days after I made it. I'm saving this one to my recipe box, but I am definitely not waiting until Easter to make it again. This might be an every couple of months dish from here on out.",
