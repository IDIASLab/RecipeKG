I believe that when I make these dumplings again with this recipe I wouldn't make them so large. However this may be difficult because when I was experimenting with the sizes it was hard to form them into smaller dumplings. So for me it will take a few tries to figure out the right technique to get the right size that works for my crew. These dumplings work well with another recipe from this site \"mom's paprika chicken\" (pictured with the dumplings.)",

May sound a bit strange but it's delicious and is one of my fondest childhood memories:) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!",

This makes quite a lot of dumplings so I actually put some of the batter in the fridge and made dumplings again a couple of days later using some vegetable broth. Yummy and comforting. I would definitely make these again for any recipe calling for dumplings. They have a really nice basic dumpling flavor and the texture is dense and filling. Thanks for a great dumpling recipe!!",
