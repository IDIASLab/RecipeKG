We had to make a couple of substitutions so we could use what we had on hand:  1) crushed pineapple instead of tidbits, 2) rice vinegar instead of distilled white, and 3) one little packet of pepper flakes from the local pizza chain store instead of the full teaspoon.  We used it as a dipping sauce with pork eggrolls and even tried it on sweet potato fries.  \nThe results: this is hands down the BEST sweet and sour sauce we've ever tasted!!  This will definitely be our go-to recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing your recipe! :o)",

I also cut the recipe in half since I am single and stored the left over in a jar in the refrigerator for another night. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!",
