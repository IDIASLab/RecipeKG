Sort of like an Iron Chef from amother foodie website. The idea was to create a recipe with 2 star ingredients then blog about it. Then others would vote on \"would they make it\" Well this was the result of a 2nd attempt. I was going for a spin on a citrus glaze for baked/grilled fish. The 2 ingredients were apricots and shallots. When I put it all together it had an amazing zing of flavors. And one that I couldn't believe was in comparasion to Sweet & Sour glaze from many of a fine chinese resturant I have ever eaten at....shocked and thrilled I couldn't wait to share with others. I have made nnumberous batches for friends and families in a small time frame since coming up with this recipe. Hope everyone else enjoys as much as we have. Note: 2 half pint jars can utilize 1 bag of frozen meatballs as well as 1 bag of popcorn chicken in the freezer section.",

My kids loved it and we even shared some jars with neighbours who now think I am the MASTER of canning!:-) I did do one recipe with the addition of 1 Cup sweet cherries cut and pitted and upped the pineapple to 1Cup. I felt safe doing that as both additions are acidic. Please remember when canning that acidity levels are crucial to safety so it is dangerous to change recipes meant for canning. In any event the addition was perfect. I have cut measured and frozen Apricots and Cherries which are seasonal items here in S. Ontario and put them in freezer bags to keep for off season preparation of the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I made it as the recipe states but for somehow losing the cumin coming home from the store and I did increase the lime juice to 1/3 cup the original didn't sound like enough acid to compensate for all the shallots. With all the sugar it made loads of liquid and of course canned with the solids floating on the top. I was able to twirl some down into the liquid after a 1 hour set. One jar I left alone. All I taste is sweet garlic and cilantro. I taste no sour at all. After 4 days I blended a jar and tested the pH and got a 4.6 just barely safe and I had increased the lime juice. If I were to make this again (and I'm not) I'd cut the sugar total down to 4 cups increase the lime juice to 2/3 or 3/4 cup omit the cilantro. Odds are for a real sweet and sour will need a recipe with vinegar. I'll probably use these jars with vinegar for meatballs",
