Next Time I will have the meat warmed in the oven before adding. I had refrigerated it and in the time it took to warm it also softened the meat a bit more than we like.

Though pretty labor intensive due to all the chopping it was very good - tasted like a Chinese restaurant dish. There are a couple of changes I would make however. First I would dry the meat thoroughly before putting it in the batter. Since I didn't the batter didn't stick to the meat and there was little \"crispiness\" to it when cooked. Second it was way too sweet for my taste. I'd cut the amount of sugar by half. But don't cut down on the ginger - it added a great zing to the dish!",
