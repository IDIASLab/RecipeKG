I also thought the addition of the apple and cranberries were the perfect accompaniment.  I did add a touch of salt and pepper.  The cooking method did not work as well for me.   After reading the reviews I decided to cover & cook for 15 minutes and uncover for 15 minutes.  The squash was cooked perfectly, but, would have been way overcooked if I had prepared it according the the recipe instructions.   I think I might even prefer it to be cooked completely uncovered so the squash roasted and caramelized instead of steaming.",

What a winner this one is!! When working with squash it's easiest to pierce it a few times then nuke it for a few minutes just long enough to be able to get a knife through it. Once it cools down it's easy enough to then scoop out the insides and peel it but that part of the prep takes the longest amount of time (and it's something you could even do a day in advance). And it's a lot cheaper than buying the ones already cut and peeled at the store. I'm not a big fan of nutmeg so I didn't use that and I use real butter instead of imitations and this was EXCEPTIONAL. The only thing I'll do different in the future is I'll do the squash prep earlier.",
