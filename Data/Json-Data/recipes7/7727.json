We did not have sake on hand so we didn't use that, We added one teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and I used a heaping tablespoon of ground ginger (because I love Ginger!). Also, instead of honey I use brown sugar and it was spectacular! We marinated the steaks and grilled them and then simmered the sauce down on the stove after bringing it to a boil and poured that over the steaks when they were done.",

My only deviations were that I skipped the fish sauce, and I couldn't find any sake due to the corona insanity and Virginia's whacky liquor laws, so I used this Korean rice liquor that was about the same.
