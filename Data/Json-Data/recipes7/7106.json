After rising nicely in the fridge all day we had to leave before I could prepare the pizza. I split the dough into 2 packages and froze them. I put one in the fridge today and let it re-rise all day. It rose again very nicely. I did prebake the crust at 450 for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. For the sauce I cut the oregano back to tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon sugar. We really liked the taste of the sauce with my adjustments. For the toppings we had: a mixture of mozzarella sharp cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (3 partial pkgs. in the freezer); thin onion slices; red orange and green pepper rings cottage cheese jalape\u00f1o rings and fresh nasturtium leaves. We really enjoyed everything about this pizza. The crust had a nice crispness to it and I m wondering if that came from the egg. Good recipe selection this week.

The only other thin I think I'd do differently next time is add a bit of sugar to the sauce to reduce the acidity. I made the dough earlier in the day in my bread machine and par baked my crusts. When it was getting close to dinner I just had to assemble them easy peasy! I got 2-12 inch pizzas out of this. The dough crisped up nicely which we really enjoyed. This is a definite keeper YUM!

Also I ve never made a pizza dough where you needed to sift the flour. So I was curious as to how this would turn out. It was a nice dough but not my favorite. I wouldn t bother with the sifting combining in a separate bowl method; just plop the remainder of the dough ingredients into the proofed yeast and process it as you would any regular pizza dough. I didn t bother with making the sauce because I had leftover tomato sauce which I used. This pizza was an excellent way to use up leftover vegetables.",
