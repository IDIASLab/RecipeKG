I spotted this recipe a while back and felt that today was the best day to try it. However, I really do not like these cookies. \n\nI followed the recipe, so that wasn't the issue. I think it'a my tastebuds. I took one bite into the cookie and thought they tasted very weird. Avocado naturally has a subtle yet unique taste. It's fruity yet buttery, savory yet sweet. In this recipe, a new side of avocado is displayed: one that isn't overshadowed by eggs, bacon or toast; one that isn't mixed together with tomato, lemon, red onions and more to make guacamole. I'm used to avocado being the palate, not the star. In these cookies, they are the star, and paired with the butter, they seemed overwhelming to me. Like really strange butter cookies. \n\nI really wanted to love these cookies - the color is beautiful, making them was fun, and they smell great. But I am not a fan. I am a fan of the creativity behind this recipe, though!",

I happened to have one avocado that I needed to use it or lose it. I made it as written but did dip the tops in turbinado sugar before baking. Using my small (3-bites for me 2-bites for DH) cookie scoop I got 74 cookies from a single batch. That is enough to share with several people. The cookies took 9 minutes in my electric oven and baked up crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. The flavor is very gentle with this cookie kind of reminds me of a sugar cookie. Definitely not an avocado but kind of like a creamy texture of an avocado. I know that sounds really weird but they are very good and you should try them for yourself to really understand what I'm trying to explain.",
