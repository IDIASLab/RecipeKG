It is an interesting recipe--with 3/4 c cornstarch plus gelatin plus sugar water boiled to 240 the likelihood that this will at least \"gel\" is pretty good which was reassuring to me. The texture was somewhere between jello-squares and gum-drops very sticky stuff (when it says to be generous with the powdered sugar--be generous)! The color was a pale orange; if I made it again I would add orange food coloring. The taste was orange-y and not bad but odd to me. Maybe I'm jaded by chocolate fudge and candies like divinity but the sweet sugary flavor I expected was not as pure--either the flavor of the cornstarch tainted it or the orange flavor wasn't strong enough. If I made it again I would either add more OJ or add orange extract. I did use fresh orange zest--which made for an interesting sort of chunky texture--and maybe dried zest would have given more flavor per Tbsp. Unless I have a specific reason--like a CS Lewis book club--I don't think I'll be making this again. It was pretty time consuming and the results were a bit disapointing.",

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted walnuts for the pistachios. Like other reviewers I too noticed that the mixture doesn't get \"very thick\" rather it gets more like the consistency of gravy. It sets up just fine though after several hours.
