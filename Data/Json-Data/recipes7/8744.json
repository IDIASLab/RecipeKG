Warning - cook this very slowly stirring often to avoid scorching the milk / rice. Stir while cooling. I did add some vanilla and some powdered sugar to the whipped cream. Everyone loved it. This makes more than 4 servings because it is so rich. An easy yet special dessert to make ahead for entertaining. Note: Cinnamon would be a great addition and then serve with spiced apples instead of berries.",
