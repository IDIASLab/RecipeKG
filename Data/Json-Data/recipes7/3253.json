I did do things a little different I doubled the recipe but I didn't double the pancake syrup. I also omitted the rum extract and added more vanilla. I wasn't too sweet and the taste of bananas was through out the sauce I'm thinking when we make this again I want to try it with mashed bananas instead. thanks",
