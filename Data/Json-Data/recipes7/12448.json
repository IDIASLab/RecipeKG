So instead of watercress, I used a mix of spinach and greens and eliminated the cilantro- We just have never acquired a taste for it. Then I took some imitation king crab , shredded and mixed with mayonnaise and put it on top of the salad as serving. I cannot express enough how much the salad was enjoyed and is definitely one that I will be making again. Next time however , I will reduce the amount of hearts of Palm ,as I just found there was too much of it. Take the time to make this salad it\u2019s worth it",

The crunch of the hearts of palm fresh watercress and onion compliment the smoothness of the avocado and mango. The dressing slightly acetic with a hint of sweetness enhances the palm avocado and mango. My gang couldn't get enough of it! I'll be making this one again very soon.",
