You may follow most of a recipe but want to share your own adaptions. That being said... This recipe is to die for!! I made the dough as written with the exception of 1 tsp nutmeg added. It is flexible and a dream to work with. Rises beautifully. I wanted to use both the cinnamon filling as listed and the cream cheese filling of the \"King Cake\" also on this site so that is what I did. (8oz softened cream cheese 1/2 c gran. sugar and 1/4 c 10X sugar)....blended this and spread first. Then followed directions for the cinnamon sugar filling from this recipe (doubling it) And I added 1 cup chopped pecans. I placed a greased bowl in center of my circle to hold the shape definitely needed to as cake rose spectacularly and would have been solid. I made my own frosting/glaze and used the traditional Mardi Gras colors of decorating sugars. The cake is sweet moist and delightful! Both fillings are Not a necessity...but a decadent treat! I am adding 5 photos of the stages of building this cake! Definitely will make again and again!",

I mixed 8 oz of cream cheese with 1/2 c. of brown sugar and it turned out really well. Powdered sugar would probably be great too but I didn't have enough after making the glaze. Any type of fruit pie filling or chocolate is also really good. For the glaze on top of the cake I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to make it really thick so it wouldn't all run off the cake and pool up on the sides. Overall I'd say this recipe is a keeper!",

I was amazed at the ease of handling the dough once it was done. I replaced the chopped pecans with raisins I had plumped and doubled the filling mixture. I baked it on a pizza pan so it would be nice and round. I was afraid I didn't butter the pan enough but it slid right off onto the cooling rack which I covered with parchment paper so I could drizzle the icing and sugar without too much mess. It was so easy to make but the taste was OUTSTANDING! I told Hubby I will have to make this every year and he informed me that I can make it all year long he doesn't want to wait a year.

My filling was different. Did 8 ounces softened cream cheese 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Mixed all well together and placed it as the king cake filling. Still good the day after too!!! This is my first king cake and it was easy to make.",
