We loved it the way I made it and my husband says I need to keep making it with my mistakes left in. I didn't have enough sugar so I added  brown sugar for the 1/2 cup I was short, and I over loaded the cake with apples. My cake came out moister then most cakes with a candied like crust making it even crunchier. I am thinking if it is this good with mistakes then it is stellar made as written. A tasty, easy, forgiving recipe.",
