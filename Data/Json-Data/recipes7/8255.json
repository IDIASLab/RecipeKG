And just a helpful note I used 1/4 t of cinnamon sugar on the top of each muffin and I thought it was just about right. Next time I would probably make a struesel to put on top and maybe add some vanilla to the batter. Regarding the previous review I don't think the spice amount is a mistake. I used the amount as written and they aren't over spiced at all. They're very moist but not mushy and I think they'll be a big hit at work. They'd be great with a cream cheese frosting as well:)",

I used the full amount of spice in the dry mixture cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup because I added about a cup and a third of chocolate chips used egg beaters and replaced half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I will not replace the oil again because the cupcakes really stuck to the muffin papers. Texture wise it was spot on though. Not the fault of the recipe - I should have known with such a small amount of oil not to change it. But that is my fault not the recipe. Oh I made my own self rising flour (used the self raising flour recipe on this site) and it worked just fine. My muffin tins must be bigger than the submitter because I only got 22 muffins out of this recipe. The pumpkin flavor was balanced beautifully in this recipe and the addition of the chocolate chips enhanced the flavor even more. We'll definitely have again!",
