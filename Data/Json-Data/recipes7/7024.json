Note: The tea will turn orange-nothing special, they add food coloring to the tea mix.   *If it is too sweet, don't worry- it will be fixed in the next step.*......4-Fill a glass to the top with ice then pour still warm tea over the ice. This will melt a good bit of the ice and dilute the tea......5-Just before you serve the tea top with evaporated milk or Half and Half.  You can use regular milk, but it won't give the beautiful marbled results the heavier evaporated milk will.
