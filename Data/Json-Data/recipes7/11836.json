Wish that I'd had the pine nuts, followed recipe.\" What a tasty and unusual approach to butternut squash, those little purple bursting orbs of grapes made this really fun to eat, and I'm glad that it wasn't roasted w/ brown sugar and cinnamon as so many winter squashes are. Didn't have the pine nuts although I can only imagine how wonderful of an addition they would be. Sad to say that the rest of my family didn't share my enthusiasm about this though. They were probably still scared of me from all the swearing I did while cutting peeling and cubing the squash to begin w/. Those suckers are a B!",

The recipe author says they're \"optional,\" but if you have them, by all means include them because they are the absolute perfect garnish on this side dish.  Jess2011, seriously LOVED your recipe, and this would be a good addition to the Thanksgiving dinner table.",
