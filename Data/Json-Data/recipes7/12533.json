I usually do, but not this time.  Where to begin?  First, as I mixed this up it took on a horrible color.  Given the ingredients, red wine vinegar, a yellow-greenish olive oil, and a brownish-yellowish Dijon mustard, I should have known the dressing would look, well, sort of brownish.  Very unappealing, and I wondered how it would make the pasta salad look overall. We eat first with our eyes, after all. I should at least taste it first. When I did, that clinched it for me.  WAY too tangy, WAY too bold, at least for my taste buds.  I gave up at that point, not even wanting to imagine the damage the addition of three types of dried herbs would do to an already bold, overly acrid/tangy dressing. Perhaps others may still want to give this a try despite this poor review.  Some things could just simply be subjective, a matter of personal preference or one\u2019s own palate.   This just didn\u2019t work for me.",
