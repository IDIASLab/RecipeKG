Those of you finicky enough to no like the horseradish because of its presence will hate my version.\n\nUsing the ingredients listed, only varying with a whole red and a whole green bell pepper and medium carrot, yielded a bit more than 48 ounces.\n\nSecond variation: \nJuice all the vegetables and set juice aside. \n\nReturn all the pulp to a pot, add water and all other ingredients to soften for the blender and allow flavors to come together.\n\nAdd juice and boiled ingredients to a blender and puree.\n\nThis has the double advantage of keeping much of the nutrients intact through the juice of the vegetables that is not boiled and enhancing anti-oxidants that are created by boiling the pulp (tomatoes and carrots for instance are more nutritional cooked). \n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/how-to-keep-your-veggies-vitamin-packed\n\nhttp://healthyeating.sfgate.com/boiling-vegetables-deplete-nutritional-value-1438.html",
