The result was definitely was very close to what I ate and easy to boot. I've made the recipe twice once with sherry and the other time without it (substituting chinese cooking wine instead) and have found it to be more or less the same. The sherry just makes it a little bit more sweet. Also since I couldn't get my hands on Thai basil leaves or whole red chilies I used regular basil and 2 jalapeno peppers instead. Finally I cut down on the soy sauce a bit wary of other reviewers who said the dish was too salty. All in all I enthusiastically recommend this recipe.",

No way was that going to reduce in twenty minutes & it was salty before reduction. That adding the quarter cup of water? So it takes longer to reduce I guess.
