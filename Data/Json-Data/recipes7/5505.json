I used half a prepared Entemann's pound cake cut in small cubes then put raspberries and blackberries on top of that sprinkle with a teaspoon of Grand Marnier then the lemon curd/mascarpone mixture and then repeated the layers ending with a third layer of cake and berries. Topped with fresh whipped cream:) The Grand Marnier got pretty strong as we got down to the bottom! Next time I would make this the night before. And I put mine in wine glasses instead of jars. Thank you for this great idea:)",

I layered half of the pound cake and few raspberries in the bottom of the bowl and sprinkled with a good amount of the water/lemon juice/sugar mixture. Then after mixing the cheese lemon curd and lemon zest I added half of the mixture to one batch of whipped cream and layered on top of the cake/raspberries. I basically did two layers of this topping with the cream/cheese/curd mixture. On top I added some plain whipped cream the raspberries and chocolate shavings. The cheese/curd mixture was way too strong if left alone. It was great when mixed with the whipped cream.",

It really didn't take a lot of time or effort to create something special that provided a wonderful ending to dinner. To lighten this up a bit I used angel food cake vs. pound cake along with reduced fat mascarpone cheese (not easy to find I might add). I used a mix of blueberries raspberries and blackberries (any combination of berries on hand will do) layering everything into over-sized wine glasses and topped it off with light whipped cream. These definitely tasted as good as they looked!",
