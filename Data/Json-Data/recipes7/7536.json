I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup because I prefer my cornbread less sweet and found they needed a bit more time in the oven.  I guess my oven is a bit cooler than the original poster's oven.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and they turned out great.  Thanks!",

I used 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in a cup of milk and let it sit for 10 minutes in place of buttermilk but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These came out much better than I was expecting and are probably the best corn muffins i've ever had rivaling even my grandmother's. Very happy with the result.:) The only thing I might try next time is a few minutes before I take them out of the oven i'll brush the tops of them with a little bit of butter so they get a little more golden. They cooked perfectly and the sides and bottom are perfectly brown it's just that the tops are still pale though that may just be because of my style of oven. 5 star recipe though my thanks to the uploader for what will likely be something I make often.",
