I also used Domino Light and brown sugar Splenda as well as natural applesauce instead of the oil to lighten it even more. I did throw in some cocoa powder plus Splenda into about 1/3 of the batter dotted the top and then swirled it into the batter with a knife before baking to give it some flair and chocolate taste. It is more cake-like but delicious all the same!",

Instead of the 2 c. of white flour I used 1 3/4 c. of white and 1/4 c. buckwheat flour. I may increase the buckwheat flour next time. Also instead of 1/2 c. of white sugar I used 1/4 c. of white sugar and 1/4 c. coconut sugar. I substituted olive oil for the canola. Next time I would definitely add some raisins or dried cranberries to the batter - perhaps even some chopped nuts.",
