My other modifications were to add some flour and oats to the topping mixture.  I put half the batter down, some topping mixture over that.  Then, over that, I put the other half of the batter, and I finished it off with the remainder of the topping.  As for the glaze, I made my own version with melted butter, vanilla, water and powdered sugar.  The batter for this recipe is just wonderful!  So moist.   I didn't alter the batter part of this recipe at all and I won't again because it's just perfect.  I will be making this again!",
