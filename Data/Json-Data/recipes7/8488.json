I also did not have lemons on hand for the juice but I just substituted crystallized lemon for it. The true lemon shaker that I have for teas has a lemon juice substitute chart on it. I believe it called for 1/4 of a tsp for a tbsp of juice but don't quote me on that. I just mixed it in right before I put the mix in the ice cream maker.",
