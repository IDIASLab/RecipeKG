Good thing I did because my 5 year old granddaughter wanted to sneak and \"see\" the cheesecake and dropped it on the floor! Anywho on to the one that survived.....AMAZING!!!! I made a couple of changes. First I winded up using a full cup of sugar because it wasn't sweet enough with the 2/3 cup. Second I put in a splash of lemon juice for some acidity. Finally I used strawberries as a garnish. I am make some tonight for a funeral and two more this weekend for one of my Easter desserts.",
