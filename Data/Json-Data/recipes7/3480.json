I think that combining maple syrup & vanilla with the classic pairing of chocolate & creme fraiche produces an exquisite flavor everyone loved it. I didn't have enough creme fraiche so I made this using 1/2 creme fraiche & 1/2 low-fat milk. This still made the ice cream rich & delightful & with enough fat content that the ice cream was easily scooped immediately upon removal from the freezer (i.e. it wasn't rock hard). We all thought that IF I were to change this recipe adding coconut would be a good addition. Highly recommended!",
