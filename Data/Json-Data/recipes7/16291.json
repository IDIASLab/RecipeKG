I also increased the butter to 9 T and doubled the brown sugar topping to fill a 9x13 pan. I also used sweetened coconut and the topping turned out delicious! I knew the cake would be dense so I increased the baking powder to 1 tsp but it still turned out dense. The crumb was not as sweet as I expected but very coconutty which was actually a nice balance to the sweet topping. I would prefer it a little lighter but it still was good. Next time I would probably increase the flour and leavening.",
