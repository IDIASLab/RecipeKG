I followed the recipe exactly but for one thing. because of some unexpected things we made the dough one night. and didn't roll and bake them for almost a week later. I also took a few suggestions from Alton Brown's Good eats show and split the dough up into 4 sections before I chilled it then rolled and baked each section using powdered sugar instead of flour. I also used a set of 1/4 inch rolling pin bands so that the dough rolled even and to the right depth. Those made a difference too. They were a huge hit at my daughter's Christmas Party. However I can't speak too the taste of the icing or anything because we simply dusted the cookies with colored sugar and sprinkles. and I honest thing they were perfect that way. I will definatly be making them again maybe even with the icing.... oh my only negative they spread out a bit more than I expected. luckily I was making retty basic shapes but had they been more complicated they would have run together and blurred the shape. but that's about it!",

I then decided to just roll the dough into balls and bake it. Well I found the cookies to be very airy and they didn't have much taste. It was like biting into a tasteles air cookie. The frosting was WAY TOO SWEET. I made a different batch of cut-out cookies and used the frosting recipe and while everyone loved the sugar cookie no one would eat them once frosted because it was too sweet. Someone commented they could go into a diabetic coma after eating one of those cookies (of course they were kidding but still). I wouldn't recommend this recipe. Sorry I was disappointed.",
