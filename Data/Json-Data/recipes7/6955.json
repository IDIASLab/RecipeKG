I tweaked it to become an 'Almond Joy' flavored dessert because I'm on an 'Almond Joy' candy bar kick lately! I only made 2 servings. I lightened up the cheese by using 1/2 cream cheese(fat free) and 1/2 ricotta cheese. I also added a few drops of almond and coconut extracts to get that 'Almond Joy' flavor. I also topped it with sweetened shredded coconut and chocolate chips. This was soooo good that I wished it was larger than a shot glass! YUM!",
