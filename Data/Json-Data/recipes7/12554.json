I generally add diced zucchini and carrots sauteed in sesame oil along with the green onions and tofu. For a fuller flavor, use broth to substitute for half the water.  It's also great if you add ramen  noodles. I often substitute hoisen sauce for the sugar. And any meat will work, not just pork.",
