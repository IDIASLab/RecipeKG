I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out perfect. If you refrigerate the pie for a few hours, the recommended amount of cornstarch is perfect. Next time I make this pie, I will pour the starwberry mixture in a vita mixer so the sauce would be smoother.  The taste was divine, esp. the painted chocolate piecrust.  This one is a keeper!",

I was incredibly worried about this one especially when my strawberry goo thickened up pretty much immediately and I knew it wasn't going to survive 12-14 minutes on the burner. I took it off after 5 minutes and tasted it; my test taste must've had a pocket of lemon juice it was terribly sour. However this recipe turned out AMAZING! The lemon juice must've calmed down after cooling in the fridge (mine set in less than 2 hours). I never keep blueberries around because I tend to forget I have them and they go bad fairly quickly so I used sliced kiwi instead. I can picture myself sitting on the beach drinking my frozen daiquiri and eating a slice of this beauty. The only thing I would do differently next time is use less chocolate (I used my own Wilton chocolate wafers and overdid it a bit).",
