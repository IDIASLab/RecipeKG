I was not so sure about using apricots and dates but I have to say these cookies were fabulous. My classmates ate them up asked to bring some home--in other words they were a huge hit. I'm definitely making these for Christmas! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! My only regret is that I didn't have a day or two to let them sit--I bet they just get better with time.",

Very seasonal flavors and so this seemed like a great one. I'm a novice baker at best though and maybe some of my issues are from that but I found these to be a serious undertaking to make. There are so many elements... if you are planning on making these just be ready to sweat. I've run 10k marathons where I didn't work this hard! First just buy pre-skinned almonds. Second buy pre-pitted/chopped dates. Third be prepared to make 3 to 4 times as much icing because these cookies were really not very sweet at all they are a little dense. The end result is ok they go pretty well with coffee. I will probably not make these again though.",
