I chose this recipe specifically for the rice preparation, because the last time I attempted sticky rice it was a major production with a bamboo steamer and lots of pre soaking and cleanup.  This was easier by far and had a good authentic flavor, but the texture wasn't the same. I will make this again, even though the texture wasn't right.",

But the rice never actually got real soft & \"sticky.\" I even soaked the rice ahead of time in warm water (like an Asian woman at the Asian market told me to.) Followed the recipe otherwise (doubled) but ended up adding about a cup more water & cooking it about 20 more minutes... and it still wasn't real soft or sticky. After adding the coconut sauce & letting it sit 30 min it was a little bit more soft but not like I expected it to be. Maybe it has something to do with altitude?... I live at 5000 feet. The toasted coconut on top was a great finish! - Carrie from Colorado",
