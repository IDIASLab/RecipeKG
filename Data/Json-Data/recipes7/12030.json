Instead I added caramel bits (you can buy them at Wal-Mart). I added about a 1/3 of the bag to the hazelnut in my double boiler added about a 1/3 cop of the heavy whipping cream and let the caramel melt in with the hazelnut. Had to work it a bit but turned out amazing. So far I have made 2 batches and plan on making more!",
