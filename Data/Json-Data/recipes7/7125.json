I followed the instructions completely with the exception of replacing the mango topping with toasted coconut. \n\nMy only issue, however, is that I felt there wasn't enough flavour. The coconut milk and vanilla extract gave it a lovely undertone but it was very mild. Next time I make it, I will be using coconut extract instead of vanilla extract, and doubling the amount to give it a stronger coconut flavour. Also, I think it would be a good idea to add a splash of rum or kahlua, and perhaps some raisins to make it a tad more authentic.",

Only we agreed to make this as special treats once a while because its richness - don't want to get heart-attack:p For daily we'll use basic recipe of rice pudding; milk rice salt sugar cinnamon and vanilla. I made some modification; using pineapple instead of mango since this season mango is still so expensive here! Other than that I use the rice called 'nasi uduk' from last night's dinner instead of cooking from zero again. The rice I used was cooked with coconut oil already plus some herbs (cloves bay leaves and salt) - it's Indonesian style so I didn't use extra coconut milk anymore.. It turned out well and soooo yummy! Still have a bowl in the fridge for tomorrow's snack or movie time..:D",
