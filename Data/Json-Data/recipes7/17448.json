But every now and then, I do get a taste for something just a little sweet, and this scratched my itch today.  Seldom do I have a 14-oz can of sweetened condensed milk on hand, because I just don\u2019t use it often.  I buy a 6-pack of La Lecherita sweetened condensed millk (you can find in the Hspanic section of the grocery store) in 3.5 oz cans, and scaling this recipe down to 12 servings called exactly for that amount...PERFECT way to try a new recipe!  This is so easy to make and really does give you an amaretto flavor in your coffee.  I love what the cinnamon brings to this creamer, just wished it would incorporate into the creamer instead of pooling on top of the coffee (minor thing).  Thanks for sharing, this is good stuff!",
