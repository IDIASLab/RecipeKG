If you like it richer thicker creamier you should use only 1 cup of coconut milk then at the end add 1/2 cup of coconut cream stir well then remove from heat. Important fact the common bananas as we know it are not right for this dessert. They're to soft perfect eaten as daily fruit or for cake and muffin but not for Asian dessert as this. In Thailand we have harder shorter in length bananas. They're firmer and heavier. Ideally you don't use the ripe ones for this recipe. They should be half way to 70% ripe.",
