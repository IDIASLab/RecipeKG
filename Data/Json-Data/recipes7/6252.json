                "reviewBody": "Hi, I'm Jillian the submitter of this recipe.  I would like to correct a couple of things with this recipe: 1) Using a paring knife, remove the core of the cabbage then boil it (the leaves will come off easier that way) 2) In the list of ingredients after 1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce it should read 12 oz. reserved cabbage water 3) Once you're done with step 9, then you take any leftover leaves, cut them up or (shred) and place into the bottom of a roasting pan and layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over top. I use large eggs and 90/10 lean ground beef when preparing these and sometimes sub fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder. (Also, 2/3 Tbsp. is 2 tsp. for the sugar) I've been making Halupki (stuffed cabbage) for years and my 98 year old Grandma has probably made thousands of these! She taught me how to make them and that's a memory I'll always treasure. We had such fun that day... Be sure to serve with mashed potatoes or sour cream and chive mashed potatoes for a twist. I hope you and your family enjoy these as much as everyone in my family does! UPDATE - It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of my Grandma Jean at the age of 104. June 26, 1914 - November 23, 2018. Love and miss you!!!!",

Thanks for a great recipe Jillian! **update** I used some I had frozen - they were perfect! Freeze very well! ***I would like to add that this was one of my mom favorite things to eat when she was living with me.  I had to puree it for her as she eventually developed swallowing issues.  She always ate this for me and she turned away MANY other things I might offer her.  Thanks Jillian for the recipe and for making my mom happy. :)",

Having grown up in a diverse family (Russian, Polish, Hungarian and German family members), I've had a LOT of \"Galumpies\" as I called them. Our Russian family added shredded carrot and sauerkraut to the meat mixture, along with onion and rice. This had crushed tomatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, brown sugar and a little lemon or vinegar. The German recipe was similar, only no sauerkraut and shredded carrot. The Polish family had a sweet/sour tomato sauce made by adding raisins (not a big fan). Our Hungarian family used paprika (1 tbs or so) along with sauteed onion to the meat, again no egg. They were placed on a bed of sauerkraut with Hungarian smoked sausage chunks or kielbasa tucked around. I tend to make the Hungarian version, without the smoked sausage but with a can of crushed tomatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, brown sugar, vinegar and paprika. I put the unused cabbage, chopped, around the rolls (seated on Bavarian-style sauerkraut) before I pour on the tomato sauce and bake.",

I also add canned tomatoes to the meat mixture since I have plenty I can myself. I add the rice raw and it cooks with the rest of it. Also, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce added to the meat gives it more flavo. I also use brown sugar instead of white in making the sauce. BE SURE YOU ONLY WILT THE LEAVES AND NOT COOK THEM COMPLETELY. Once they begin to look translucent (change color) they are ready to be taken off of the core. \r\n\r\nThis is one of my family's favorite recipes!",
