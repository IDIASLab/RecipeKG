I'm used to using only 1 egg for a batch of muffins, so I was surprised to see that this recipe called for 3.  However, I used 3 anyway, and I'm glad I did because that gave the muffins a nice cake-like texture.  These are not excessively sweet like the muffins you buy in the store, so if you want something sweeter, you may want to double the sugar, but for those who want something healthier, you could probably omit the sugar entirely and use low-fat or skim milk in place of the heavy cream.",
