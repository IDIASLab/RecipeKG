It was fabulous and now my husband asks for it all the time.",

It looked like too much butter to drizzle on top so I poured half off and drizzled the remaining sugar/butter mixture over the top. I also stirred a half teaspoonful of cinnamon into the four mixture before combining. It was wonderful with fresh strawberries. Thank you",
