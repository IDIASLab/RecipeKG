I'm not sure they really added any flavor but they did add color and texture which is always nice. The one change I recommend is in the sauce. It needs tripled if you want \"sauce\". I originally made as written and could tell it wasn't going to be enough so I doubled it. I maybe could have stopped there but decided to triple it and I'm glad I did. It was just enough to soak into the rice.",
