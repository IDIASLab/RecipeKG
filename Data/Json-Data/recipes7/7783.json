Not too sweet, just right.\" Ahh a waffle recipe that doesn't call for separating eggs, and beating the whites! My family loved these waffles (if you could believe it, they liked them better 2 days later toasted, and w/ just butter), but I wasn't quite as wild about them; a little dense, but that's just a matter of taste. I knew making them w/ the oat, and skipping the separating of the eggies, that the end result wouldn't be a fluffy light waffle, but hey, 2 out of 3 people in my house devored them, and they were easy to make, so Success!",
