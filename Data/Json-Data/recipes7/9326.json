It has the perfect balance of oil-vinegar and doesn't need oregano basil and garlic as you find in most italian dressings. Unfortunately it is so high in fat that it's something that will have to be an occasional treat for us. I may try reducing the oil in an effort to get fat grams down as I'd like to serve this more often. The fat is an issue for me but I'm giving this 5 stars based on flavor because it is good!",
