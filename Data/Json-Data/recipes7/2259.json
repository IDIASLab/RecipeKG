Instead we put them in the oven along with all the marinade covered for about an hour and a half. We did replace 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup beer just to cut calories a little. Served with baked potatoes and veggies it made a great easy weeknight dinner. We cut up the leftover pork simmered with the remaining pan juices and served it over egg noodles for a super-quick leftover dinner. A little pasta water and flour slurry made the pan juices a little more gravy-like. Flavors were fabulous! Hubby has already requested this for next week!",
