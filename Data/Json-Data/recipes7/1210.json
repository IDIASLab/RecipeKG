I made it the day before Thanksgiving so luckily I gave it a chance and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I'm so glad I did because this was my favorite thing on Thanksgiving! I liked that it wasn't so spicy because you can use it on your turkey if you want. I made a few changes - I added 3/4 cup sugar added green onion used apple juice instead of orange liqueur (didn't have any) used a whole cucumber didn't use celery and also added some of the juice from the pickled jalapeno jar. This was really good and was a hit with all my guests.",

I substituted 1 tsp of orange extract and 2 tablespoons of cherry syrup for the Grand Marnier. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped white onion. The flavors blend so well together. This makes a nice fresh alternative to traditional salsa. I'll be giving some away over the holidays for sure!!",
