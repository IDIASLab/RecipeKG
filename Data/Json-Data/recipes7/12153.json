I added shallots and fresh mushrooms, and extra seasoning of Montreal Steak Seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and more pepper.  Also, instead of simply setting the saut\u00e9ed steaks aside under tented foil while completing the recipe, I put them in a shallow baking dish with a little water, covered it and baked it at 350 degrees, maybe for half an hour, to ensure the steaks were tender. Rather than discarding the remaining juices once it came out of the oven I added it to the gravy, which contributed additional beefy flavor.  In addition to being a little on the nondescript side, the gravy is very rich \u2013 perhaps this might be better using equal parts beef broth and milk.",

Lately I have been cutting the meat into strips, which my family loves and is great for kids.  I floured too much and threw the extra into the freezer.  A couple weeks later I thawed it, dipped in milk then more flour and had an even crunchier crust.  My family fell in love with this new process.  FYI NEVER use oil to fry these.  Always use plenty of butter and not too hot.",
