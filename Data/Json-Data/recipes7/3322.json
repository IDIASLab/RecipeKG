The coleslaw in this recipe is all wrong. As another user wrote Primanti's doesn't use mayo or milk in their recipe. I have made these sandwiches at home a bunch of times and found a coleslaw recipe on this site that tastes pretty much exactly like they use in the restaurant. The recipe is called Amish Slaw. Also capicola isn't the only meat you can use...they have a wide variety of choices at the restaurant from cheesesteak roast beef turkey cajun chicken pastrami egg and cheese fish...basically whatever you can imagine. Also throw some french fries on your next salad and you got a Pittsburgh salad!",

The coleslaw is unfortunately all wrong and in this case it is the coleslaw which is unique to PB. They do not use mayo or milk in their coleslaw which gives it its unique taste and texture. Also I believe the olive oil has much too strong a taste to use for the fries. That being said it's still a good recipe even though I'd never add milk in any coleslaw.",
