I opted to follow another reviewer and baked it at 350 for about 70 minutes, and used a meat thermometer just to be sure. Also, I would recommend cutting out the teaspoon of salt - there is plenty in the Worcestershire sauce. It was yummy over rice, but I can see egg noodles or even mashed potatoes as well.",

I used Brown sugar and added honey and cayenne pepper and extra mustard and I rubbed the chicken down with brown sugar before putting the sauce on it to even out the acidity and spice of it. Also served over white rice and I'm definitely making this again.",

UNFORTUNATELY, I followed some of the other suggestions to dip the chicken in egg/flour/breadcrumbs and fry first.  Don't do it! The coating became mushy and was way too heavy for the dish.  I think this chicken does NOT need to be coated and browned first.  I did cook at 350 for about 1 hour 30 minutes... covered for the first hour.  Served with noodles (with sauce over it).  Will make again, Without coating/browning chicken!",

If you have the time, I would definitely recommend this. :)",

The recipe was really easy to follow and was very flexible. I had most of the ingredients in the fridge except a few but I substituted for what I didn't have and it was great! I used a light brown sugar instead of white, I am out of A-1 and paprika so a little of whatever I had in the spice cabinet and some Chipotle BBQ sauce worked fine. Positive that I am going to rotate this recipe into the menu! Thanks for sharing",

I then sauted sliced onions and mushrooms  with a little butter, olive oil, salt and pepper. I put this on top of the chicken before putting the sauce on. I added a little hot sauce (Siracha) and chopped garlic to the the sauce also. Baked at 325 for about 1.5 hours. Delish!!! Served with Jasmine rice.",
