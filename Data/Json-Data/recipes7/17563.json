It works well as a starter for four, or as a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate, serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site. Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices of fresh onion.",

Rather than mixing the water and tomato paste separately, I just stirred them right into the chickpea mixture. Also, I this was a pretty dry sauce, and I wanted it to be a little \"saucier\", so it wouldn't just lie on the tomato patties in a lump. I added 2 t paste instead of 1, and eventually added about 1/2 cup of water, stirring it in gradually to get the consistency right. It was definitely spicy, so I cut back on the cayenne a bit so my son would eat it. It was full of delicious Indian flavors and I will be making this again! A great vegan dinner.",
