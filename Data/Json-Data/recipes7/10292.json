So instead I bought some pork butt instead selecting the darker cuts of meat. The second was when I went to add the squash after it baked in the oven. he stew looked a little dry so I added abut 1/2 cup of red wine to it along with the squash. It turned out very good. Nice flavor and tender meat and veggies. I want to try it with the lamb next time since I think that will be an even better flavor.",
