I didn't want too much sugar on it so I just rubbed some on the top rather than rolled them. But I LOVE this recipe. I have been trying to find it for quite a while now. I grew up in Toronto and there was a little Jewish bakery by me that made just these sorts of cookies. They closed down and I missed tasting these. Thanks for the recipe!",

We now mostly use ground hazelnuts, we like the flavour of those over walnuts, but I'll still switch it up.  My grandmother always used to shape into crescents and I would watch her, and say \"This is taking soooo long, just shape them into balls, they'll taste the same!\".  But noooo, they had to crescents.  The torch has been passed and I'm making them now...in balls!  Ha!  Rolling into balls makes them less likely to fall apart when picking them up off the cookie sheet, and its easier to roll in the cinnamon sugar.  Also, when you're bringing them to a party (because you WILL be asked to) they are less likely to break than the crescents.\nDon't change the recipe.  If your cookies aren't turning out, YOU are doing something WRONG.  This has been baked by practically every member of my family in different countries over 4 decades.  It's awesome!!",
