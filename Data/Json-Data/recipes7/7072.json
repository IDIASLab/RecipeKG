I also curse you, because I have diabetes and have had to exercise an unreasonable amount of willpower since making them. Don't worry, I am sharing!(I also skipped the glaze. I don't even want to KNOW how they taste with that.) Again, from the bottom of my vial of insulin, I thank you.

I dropped the salt to 1 teaspoon and I found it to be plenty - could probably drop it to 3/4 tsp w/ good results too.  Instead of incorporating the walnuts into the batter I sprinkled them on top.  When you mix the nuts into the batter they get steamed.  By adding the nuts on top of the batter they will get toasted and give a better texture.",

I prepared them in mini muffin pans with the intention of prettying them up with a rosette of vanilla buttercream frosting, festive Christmas sprinkles and a Hershey's mint truffle kiss.  Good thing. On their own the brownies are fairly nondescript -more cake-like than chewy (reduce or eliminate the baking powder next time) and not deeply chocolate enough (next time substitute a couple of tablespoons of cocoa to replace same amount of flour and maybe add a teaspoon or two of espresso powder or instant coffee granules to intensify the chocolate flavor).  This in spite of the fact I'm sure these were improved merely because I used (melted) butter instead of the vegetable oil.  The frosting and mint truffle kiss gave the impression then, that these brownies were much better than they really were.",
