I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of fresh red chile pepper and added twice the amount because we love our food a little spicier. Also I sadly cut the amount of onions by half thinking it'd be too onion-y but should've just used the original amount in retrospect. I didn't have basil on hand but the sauce came out just as tasty! I added Polska Kielbasa to the sauce and it was very complementary with the textures and flavors of the sauce. This recipe is delicious with garlic bread or knots!",

I didn't have the Marscapone cheese so I used this as a substitute (make in proportion to the 2/3 cup called for... I loosedly made 1/2 of the following: 8 oz cream cheese 1/4 c heavy cream 2 1/2 T. sour cream). Make this and your friends and family will RAVE about it! Enjoy!",

And I imagine it is good as is, but I made the following changes:\n\n> I first saut\u00e9ed four italian sausages and two very thinly sliced chicken breasts. Once browned and cooked through, I removed them, added a bit more EVOO, and saut\u00e9ed the onions and garlic in the EVOO and meat fat.\n\n> I added two bay leaves along with the diced tomatoes and other ingredients; I also shredded the chicken and sliced the sausage and threw them in with the diced tomatoes to allow them to stew and soak up the sauce's flavor.\n\n> I also added a small can of tomato paste to make the sauce a bit thicker.\n\nI doubt the sauce needed all this, but with these additions this sauce was amazing.
