You lose the refined sugar and the trans fats that way. It's a really nice mildly sweet bread that will be great for breakfast-type uses. I also added a little more caraway because this recipe makes FOUR loaves not two. 12 cups of flour seemed like an awful lot but I diligently followed the recipe and ended up with a TON of dough. Also the recipe is missing a key direction: when to add the activated yeast to the other ingredients! I mixed the raisins flour and caraway separately. Then I added the yeast to the water/molasses/honey/butter mixture just before adding the flour mixture in parts. So I can recommend doing it that way because it worked for me!",

I adjusted the amount to yield one loaf to see if we were going to like it (you can do this by clicking on Change Settings above the list of ingredients). I let the bread machine take care of the dough part. It rose beautifully in the loaf pan. My only criticism is the bake time is way off so keep an eye on it. It could be because I had only one loaf baking in the oven. This loaf was perfect in 30 minutes.",
