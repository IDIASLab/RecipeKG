The Granny Smith apple gives you a nice tart contrast to the sweetness of the sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Next time, I'll try using the granulated Splenda to reduce calories.  Very nice, fresh side dish or dessert (either with a dollop of whip cream or a scoop of ice cream).",

My toddler loves fruit, so I wanted to give her something a little sweet but still kinda healthy. I didn't change the amounts of sugar, water or cornstarch. I also added 1 tbsp of lemon juice and upped the baking time to 25 minutes (I didn't want the apples too mushy and that was just right). According to a nutrition calculator I use, this makes it around 45.5 calories for 6 servings (remember, I'm serving this to my toddler). All in all, this recipe was great. The only real change I made was using the lemon juice. If the baby doesn't like it, it is not the fault of the recipe! This tastes just like apple pie filling!",

TIP: when the apples are finished baking and you unstick the apples from the baking sheet there is clear sticky stuff under the apple slice. That is the stuff that you want that is the sugar and the sweetness of the apple. If you want your apples to be sweet make sure you eat that also. It is not going to hurt you it is just the sugar that has been baked. Hope this helped!",
