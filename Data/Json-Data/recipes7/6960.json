I followed the crepe batter recipe exactly as written. When I made the apple filling I noticed that it got dry very quickly. Maybe I had the flame setting too high on my burner. Since I was worried about scorching the cinnamon and sugar I decided to add some apple juice. I added 2/3 cup of apple juice. It thickened up nicely with the sugar cinnamon and cornstarch. At the end I decided to add 2 Tablespoons of butter. I highly recommend that you try this recipe. I love that it uses very common pantry ingredients. If you don't happen to have any apples at home you could just spread some preserves or jam on these crepes. This apple recipe reminded me of apple pie. Thanks Dancing Cupcake for a very nice recipe that will impress anyone you serve it to. Enjoy!",

I made it with half red apples & half granny smith so it came out pretty sweet but my group liked that. It was easy to make & hard to mess up given that I was only half paying attention while I was making it. I filled the crepes once with just the apples which everyone liked & then I made another batch where I put a little creamy peanut butter & some melted chocolate sauce on the crepe first and then filled with the apple filling. That sounded gross to me at first but it was actually really yummy if you like chocolate peanut buttery desserts.",

I let the crepe batter sit in the refrigerator overnight. I only used 1/4 cup batter per crepe for a 7 inch frying pan as the crepes were too thick with 1/3 cup. The crepes are time consuming but easy. I was baking cookies (from frozen homemade cookie dough) and preparing other recipes for the brunch while cooking the crepes so they didn't require full attention (great for an ADD cook!). I will make these again!",

The crepe recipe itself is one of the better ones I've used. Very good consistency and instructions. I did end up using much less oil in my non-stick crepe pans... I used the tsp called for in the pan when I made the 1st crepe and it was too much. Cooked the next 2 or 3 without adding any oil at all and just added a drop per crepe after that. I found it easier to flip the crepes into a 2nd pan to cook the other side which also allowed me to cook 2 crepes at once and save some time. These crepes are on the thicker side as crepes go and we liked them that way but it would be easy enough to thin the batter with a bit more milk to make them thinner if desired. Without thinning the batter my yield was 11 crepes but there was only enough filling for 7 and even these could have used a teeny bit more filling... so I will either increase the filling recipe or decrease the batter recipe next time to make them match up better.",
