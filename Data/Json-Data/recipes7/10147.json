Next time I will buy the tzatziki at Trader Joe's or COSTCO etc. They carry it and it's delicious so just cuts down on time. What I loved about this recipe is the 1st ingredient - a package of roasted garlic flavored mash potatoes. What a neat idea and it really added to the flavor immensely! I think I will try that next time I make garlic bread. The salad served over the roasted garlic bread was a great combo. Much better than just serving the salad alone. Very good but very time consuming. Start chopping now;-)",
