Using a cookie scoop and soda bottle cap to make the indentations results in uniform cookies, which makes a nice presentation. But you can improvise with other lids; just aim for something about the size of a quarter. Use any variety of jelly, but I do not recommend jelly with chunks of fruit, like strawberry. Attempting to move the cookies prior to cooling completely will cause them to break.",

I used my 1 tbsp scoop and got 51 cookies that baked in 16 minutes on Silpat lined sheets. I used homemade strawberry jam as that is what we like.",

Used the same dough. Rolled the dough in crushed almonds. And baked for the time it says. One batch was done with the jam. And another I added Reese cup to the center.

Swaps: gluten free flour blend re-hydrated PB2 and home-canned hot fudge/plum sauce instead of jam. I needed to do some pantry use-ups as well as make this something a Celiac could safely eat. Other than not being as pretty as the original and having so much less fat it worked out great! Also I tried the two-tablespoon size and that has to be a typo so I halved all the balls and it worked out fine. Thank you for the recipe!",
