I didn't really taste the orange flavor but that could be because I didn't have fresh orange zest and had to use dried. Despite that though this cake is very light and refreshing. I like the fruit and it'll go into my few beloved cake recipes of applesauce cake and carrot cake (I'm not a big sweets fan). I used a bundt pan and it worked just fine. Thanks!",

I haven't really baked with strawberries or rhubarb and I was hoping the fruit would retain it's color somewhat but it turned light pink - at first I was disappointed in the appearance but it still tasted good. The orange flavor comes through nicely - without being too \"fruitcakey\" - and compliments the strawberries and rhubarb perfectly. Served with real whipped cream - pretty sure I'll make this one again! Thanks for sharing!",

I needed 2 tablespoons of orange zest, but only got 4 teaspoons from the orange I had, so I used 2 teaspoons of orange extract to make up the difference.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger (will add more next time)to the flour mixture, and also substituted part of the all-purpose flour with stone ground whole wheat flour to up the nutritional value.  The cake did take about 20 minutes extra to bake. I think next time I'll bake at 375 instead.  I served it warm with a swirl of whipped topping on top.  Delicious!  *** I recently made this exactly as written and it was fantastic.  A keeper for sure!",
