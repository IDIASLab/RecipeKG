Here is what I changed- I halfed the pasta just one box (and use Barilla's protein plus penne) omitted the carrots added 1 onion doubled the garlic Instead of using Italian seasoning I added 3 tablespoon fresh basil & 1 teaspoon oregano. doubled the ricotta cheese added I cup shaved parmesan cheese on top. I used regular mozzarella instead of Italian cheese blend. ( I don't know how 2 boxes of pasta would've fit it barely all fir in the baking dish as it was with one box.) I ended up saut\u00e9ing the veggies longer so I only had to bake it for 45 min. I thought 1 1/2 hours seemed to long anyways. The family loved it! It was a big hit!",
