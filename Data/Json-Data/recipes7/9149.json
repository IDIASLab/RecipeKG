It was surprisingly moist with a very rich chocolate flavor.  I've made it twice.  The first time I tried to reduce the amount of oil and zucchini, but found it to be more of a brownie in texture.  On the second attempt I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  So my only advice is not to skimp on anything.  My only complaint is it's addictive.",
