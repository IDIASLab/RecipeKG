It has a lot less punch than your standard buffulo wings. It is sweet to start and then a hint of \"heat\" afterward. I loved it and so did everyone else thats tried it. I would give it 5.5 P.S. had trouble finding hot pepper paste. Had to go to asian market.",

The first time I made it w/o onions it didn't make a big impact on taste. Like the rest I was unable to find Gochujang paste and went with Thai sweet chili. Since the chili is already sweet I also omitted the suger and lemon peper. I made it using Golden Delicious Apples which i found to be perfect for the taste. I put too much peper and wine in the first try and it was very sauce and peper heavy. The second time I lightened up on the wine and the blance was perfect. I perfer to cut the chicken into larger chunks. The second time i did them too small and it began to shred into pieces as i cooked it. I used a simple white Chardoney tastes good!",
