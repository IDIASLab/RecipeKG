I took the advice of another poster and reduced the amount of sugar, and since I only had 29 oz. cans of peaches and a 9x9 pan instead of 8x8 I ended up using most of the peaches from the larger can in order to have enough fruit in the cobbler.  Not sure how it would be fruity enough with only a 15 oz can!!!  I also sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of white sugar because I thought it would look prettier that way - So yummy!",

Grandma always used a cast iron skillet, her own peaches that she canned herself and she would wisk a tablespoon or so of cornstarch to the peach \"juices\" in the saucepan before she added the peaches and sugar. At the last, before she put the cobbler into the oven, she'd sprinkle a little sugar over the top. To this day, it's one of my most favorite desserts. I've tried to make this in a baking dish or pan and it just dosen't taste as good as it does when it's been cooked in a cast iron skillet, to me anyway. To really take it over the top, try this with cold vanilla bean ice cream!",
