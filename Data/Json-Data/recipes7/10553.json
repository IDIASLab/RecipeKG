I had some left over baked sweet potatoes and some eggnog and ended up with a rich and creamy pie that my friends request again and again. Yams or potatoes work really well, too. Since eggnog is only commercially available during the holidays, I've resorted to making my own during other times of the year. I use various recipes from Allrecipes.com.

                "reviewBody": "I thought this would be a good way to use up some organic eggnog but it didn't turn out as yummy as I thought it might. You can't really taste the sweet potato or the eggnog; it's rather a subtle and nondescript blend of both which may be a plus for some people but it didn't really thrill me. I didn't use the rum because I needed it to be kid-friendly (used a couple teaspoons of vanilla instead). It was definitely better the next day so I would plan ahead if making this pie. It's not so great on the third day and beyond so this is a pie for celebrations and holidays rather than one to have sitting around the house for a few days. The problem being that it starts gathering moisture on top like pumpkin pie is apt to do so I just pat it off with a paper towel. This would have been worse than it is because I didn't drain the water off the sweet potato puree like I normally do (which usually fixes the moisture problem) but I added a couple teaspoons of flour to the sugar and spice mixture before I added it to the other ingredients so it wasn't too bad. I'll probably stick to my normal sweet potato pie recipe and save the eggnog for something that is more neutral initially (like cake or cookies which only have flour as a base \"flavor\"). I like both ingredients but the combination of the two just didn't do it for me. Thanks for the recipe though.:)",
