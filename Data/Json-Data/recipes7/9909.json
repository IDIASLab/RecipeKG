It is so flavorful!  The only changes I made were using less sugar, (3/4 C of sugar) and 5 oz of Evaporated Milk \n(rather than 1/2 C milk).  This is all I had in the house.  \n\nIt truly came out like a Sweet Potato Pie as opposed to the taste of a Pumpkin Pie.  I noticed that amazingly enough, the recipe is identical to Sweet Potato Pie 1, my next recipe choice.  My Fiance' loved the pie as well, so no need to fancy it up!",

I didn't have any but I thought it would make it taste too much like pumpkin. Increased cinnamon a bit (just rounded the measuring spoon). Also used half Splenda & half sugar. Family loved it and I also took to a work pot luck lunch and they all loved it too. I also used a frozen pie shell but after thawing I put it in the oven for 10 minutes. Kept the bottom from being soggy.",
