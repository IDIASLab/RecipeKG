You can easily adjust the recipe or make leftovers last longer by adding pine nuts golden raisins etc. My couscous was bland and stuck together. So when making more for leftover stew I sauteed minced garlic in 3 tbsp. olive oil then added the water brought to a boil and added couscous. The couscous had garlic-olive oil flavor and had much better texture than the first batch.",

I substituted 1/2 cup of raisins for half the olives to give this some sweetness as Moroccan dishes usually have. I found I needed to add more cumin and some ground cinnamon along with the cinnamon stick because it was bland. I also didn't like the potatoes in this. I've never had potatoes in a Moroccan or Middle Eastern dish and they threw off the texture and flavor of the dish for me. To keep this vegan I skipped the yogurt and added toasted pine nuts. I also substituted mint for the cilantro. Overall not a \"wow\" in our family. We'll finish the leftovers but I won't be making this dish again.",
