I made it as written first time and it was good, but the second time, it was even better when I made these changes: I omitted the white sugar and subbed in brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added some ginger (a healthy dash) and some nutmeg (a regular dash). I also omitted the water, it was not necessary and my second batch without the water was a much, much better consistency. (The apples are juicy and release that juice when baked, so go ahead and skip adding that water.) Oh, and in both batches, I used old-fashioned oats, not the quick cooking kind and I subbed corn starch for the flour in the filling, something I always do for fruit pies, cobblers, etc... :-)",

Used 10 large honeycrisp apples, 5. lbs, from local farmer, for each 9 x 13 recipe. It will fill the pan (with a rounded top like a cake), so press the topping on with a large spoon and put the pan on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Followed others' suggestions & added some of my own. Use apple corer/peeler, all brown sugar, all whole wheat fllour, old fashioned oats, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. cloves, & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Stir 2 tsp. vanilla extract into melted butter. Wondered whether initial sugar/flour/water mixture would blend in better if it were stirred into apples rather than sprinkled on top. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time!) I would either omit water or add cornstarch or tapioca to water, since it was rather watery. Apples did not get mushy. Tasted great & husband's co-workers ate the entire pan! We were very busy & only had time for 1/2 a pan! It's a keeper!\n\n\n\nRevised 10/20/15: Moved to WI & picked fresh apples from our two trees in backyard. Made six 8 x 8 apple crisps already using half a recipe with the following changes: Omit water & sugar (my apples are like red delicious, juicy & sweet), use cornstarch instead of flour in filling, decrease cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. but keep melted butter @ 1 stick for each topping. (Seems crisper if you mix in 1/2 stick, then pour other half over topping after it cooks 30 min.)  Cook 45 min. total.",

Based on comments: we mixed apples with flour/spice mix prior to putting in casserole, skipped water, cut sugar to 1/4 cup, replaced white with brown sugar. Doubled cinnamon, added powdered ginger and fresh grated nutmeg (not measured, but at least 1.5 tsp)Added vanilla (might add some bourbon next time) to flour/spice mix, and to butter/oat mix. \n\nWhole wheat pastry flour, and brown sugar instead of white. Melted butter, but plan to try mixes of butter/olive oil and/or coconut oil in the future. \n\nInstead of ice cream or whipped topping, we opted for low fat, plain yogurt drizzled on top, may add a trace of honey, molasses or maple syrup next time .. not necessary, but could be a nice addition.",

The 1/2 cup of water I poured into the dish made the whole thing too wet - however, after a night in the fridge some of it did absorb. Secondly, without any salt or lemon juice I felt that it was a little bit bland. I'd add some of both, next time.",
