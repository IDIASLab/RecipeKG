The strawberries add beautiful color to the pancakes and an extra sweetness. Also great if half a banana is added to the mix. And the topping options are endless! Serve alongside maple syrup, butter, fresh strawberries, blueberries, banana, etc., and enjoy! Brown sugar can be sprinkled on top of the completed pancakes to add a crunchy texture.",

Because my mix was whole wheat I did need a little more liquid than what was called for so I added a half cup extra buttermilk for a double recipe. I used a really great no sugar berry blend that I bought at Walmart (it's actually the Walmart brand). I just kind of guessed on the cup-age that was the strawberries and just poured what I thought was right of the berry blend to equal twenty strawberries (again double recipe). I didn't bother sprinkling the pancakes with sugar that seemed unnecessary to me and the recipe did say it was optional. This was quite good my husband didn't even complain that the pancakes were whole wheat this time! This was very easy to make I was able to make them a little healthier and use more homemade ingredients and less sugar which I appreciated. Out of a double recipe two pancakes remain. My boys really liked these!",
