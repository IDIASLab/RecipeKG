Pressed it into  a pan like one reviewer suggested: nope, fell apart.  Pressed it into mini cupcake tins:  nope, fell apart.  Refrigerated it in the the hopes that the fat would solidify to bell hold everything together: nope, fell apart.\n\nAs I was about to chuck it out in frustration, I remember that dates are naturally sticky, so I threw the mixture into a food processor and voila!  Sticky dough perfect for rolling.  It wasn\u2019t nearly as crunchy as before, so next time I\u2019ll try processing everything but the crispies, then mix those in by hand afterwards. \n\nAlso, my personal preference is they are still way too sweet.
