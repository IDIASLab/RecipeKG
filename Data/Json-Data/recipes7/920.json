I put vanilla ice cream and the strawberries in a desert dish and poured the syrup over that while the syrup was still very warm (stupid move I now know - but we loved what happened!)  When the syrup hit the cold ice cream it hardened (like the top of a creme brulee) while it remained syrupy on the strawberries.  I cannot tell you how we liked the result.  I am going to make it again tonite the proper way but this is a keeper!!!  And sooo easy - thanks submitter.",

I served it in a wine glass over 2 scoops of ice cream topped with a dollop of whipped cream garnished with a mint leaf and there you have a rich fancy dessert! It'll please the whole family!

I boiled this for 10 minutes added the other ingredients and let it sit for a few minutes off the heat as directed. Well it hardened in about a minute and wasn't syrupy at all! So I added an extra 1/2 c. of water re-melted the sugar and boiled for about 3 minutes. When I took it off the heat it remained syrupy. I just put it over sliced strawberries and it was tasty...the spices were a nice addition as was adding a warm sauce. So in spite of my inability to properly boil sugar and water this still turned out quite yummy. Thanks!",
