Sorry for all of the changes but I tried it and then adjusted accordingly--I upped the amount of salt to 1 tsp doubled the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of apple pie spice and used all margarine instead of butter and shortening mix. I also omitted the pineapple and raisins (preference) and 2 1/2 x the carrots. I only made half of the icing using cream instead of pineapple juice and it was plenty for the amount of sandwiches. I would like to try subbing in some oats for part of the flour next time so it's got a slightly different texture.",
