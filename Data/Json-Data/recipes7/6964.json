That being said, they can be changed slightly at no taste cost if you are on a ketogenic diet: substitute bread crumbs for flax meal, half-and-half for heavy whipping cream and a pinch of stevia for the sugar.  Now back to the actual recipe.  I made these little puppies for New Year\u2019s Eve.  My mother told me: \u201cWow, I haven\u2019t had any of these in so long!  I used to make these all the time.\u201d  Outcome?  My sister-in-law did not even get to eat one!  These morsels just disappeared in less than ten minutes.  I am not kidding.  I served these with habanero raspberry jam, a traditional tzatziki, and a sour cream and garlic dip.  A little tip:  The mixture is a little sticky so make sure to have a nice little bowl of water to dip your fingers from time to time.\nThank you Linda T, you made my dish the talk of the party!",
