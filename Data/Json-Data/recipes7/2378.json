One review stated that this recipe just wouldn't work the way it was written which had me concerned. I did add 1 teaspoon vanilla for flavor but otherwise followed this recipe exactly as written. There was plenty of moisture in the batter although it is thicker than your typical pancake batter and may not work for grilling the way you traditionally make pancakes. They were sweet enough that they didn't need any topping although strawberries and whipped cream would have gone well. Next time I will try substituting crushed pineapple for the fruit cocktail and adding some coconut for pina-colada pancakes.",

I used a whole egg and added in a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I had to add in a cup of buttermilk because the batter was void of all moisture aside from the egg. Oh and I also added a 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. This made it possible for me to cook it on my countertop griddle. They were good but not fantastic. I liked that I was able to use up a can of fruit cocktail but I think it was better in theory. I don't see how this recipe could work as written. I doubt I'll make them again but it was nice to experiment.",
