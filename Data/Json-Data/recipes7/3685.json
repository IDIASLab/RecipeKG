As with most pancakes with oatmeal I usually let it sit for 15 minutes or more so the oatmeal has a chance to soak up some of the liquid and puff up. I wisked the dry ingredients together then added the combined wet ingredients and gently folded it into the dry until just moistened. Very good. I served this with butter pecan syrup and bacon. The kids and I really liked this. NOTE: This recipe made quite a bit so I froze them in two's for busy mornings. All I have to do is throw them in the microwave.",
