I also used salted peanuts and I think it really made a difference - the balance of salt and sweet was delectable! It didn't firm up quite so hard as other types of fudge (such as chocolate) but it was still delicious! I gave a batch to my brother-in-law for his birthday and he loved it! I think a teaspoon of vanilla might make a nice addition to this recipe - just a thought. I loved this recipe, thank you for sharing it!",
