I also really liked the addition of the Old Bay seasoning. I had the garlic and herb flavored one and that worked fine. For ease I used a 10oz un-measured bag of shredded cabbage from Trader Joes. I also used pre-shredded carrots I always have on hand anyhow. I minced the onion and blended with the vegetables I kept separate from the dressing until serving. I tried some with and without the green peppers. I much liked it without. The green peppers sort of make it taste different than classic coleslaw. I would make this again for a family bbq. Only change is I would probably double it as this only makes about 6 servings. I would also leave out the green pepper and mix in the dressing again right before serving. Ty!",
