It is good served a bit chilled. \nI used the yogurt for buttermilk substitution another reviewer suggested, which seemed to work well. The recipe does not describe a container, so I used a deep dish pie pan as other reviewers recommended, but the pie slowly erupted like lava out of the pan for the first 20 minutes. (see photo) (The cooled pie is much shallower.) Could it have been the yogurt substitution? \nI had to bake for 75 minutes to set the inside, so a larger pan with less pie thickness would have taken less time to cook. \nAlso, even though I used very ripe hachiyas from my tree (takes 5 for 2 cups pulp), I couldn't taste the persimmons in the pie. In my opinion, the flavor was overwhelmed by the vanilla and cinnamon, so next time, I will cut back on seasonings.\nThanks for sharing this recipe.",
