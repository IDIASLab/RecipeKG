Other than substituting vanilla for the almond extract (I wanted to taste pure fresh cherry flavor) I prepared these as written and would do so again. These are quick and easy to mix up and get in the pan and a trusty muffin/cookie scoop helps that along. I ve found that the size of muffin tins varies so it s always a good idea to start baking these a few minutes under what the recipe directs and add more time as necessary. In my case I got 10 beautiful plump and perky muffins that baked in 19 minutes. These muffins will make you wish cherries were in season all year. (Even tho pitting them is kind of a pain in the neck I could do without)",

Also, the batter is thick enough that the fruit remains suspended in the batter and doesn\u2019t sink to the bottom.  No flouring of the fruit is necessary.  I always sprinkle the sugar on the muffins right after they come out of the oven so the sugar doesn\u2019t melt into the batter.

I used a jumbo muffin pan instead of making regular sized muffins. I think this worked better because even after quartering the cherries, the fruit chunks are pretty big. It took about 30 minutes to bake jumbo sized muffins, and they turned out perfect and delicious. This would be a great recipe for hosting a summer brunch!",

Also didn't have a cherry pitter so my cherry pieces were 2 big slices and 1 small slice around the pit.  Also used a round ice cream scoop to fill the muffin tins and it worked perfectly. (Don't level the scoop --just like with ice cream). The muffins baked 19 min and were slightly darker than I thought I wanted when they came out of the oven.  I quickly got them out of the pans so they would not continue to cook.  Oh my gosh --when finished they were a delicious concoction! The outside of the muffin had just the right amount of crunch, the inside was not too sweet but very moist and the taste of the big cherries was decadent.  The big pieces of cherry were perfect!  All I can think of is Tea Party!!  Lovely.  If anything, I would add another 1/4 cup of big cherry pieces.  Also, this was easy to make without turning on the mixer and waking everyone up early in the morning.  Great Recipe.  I am off to buy some more cherries -- I am in love. (-:",

So I poured 2 cups of boiling water over 5oz of dried cherries and let them sit until they were cool.  The first time I made these, I drained the cherries and used as directed. The batter came out almost like dough and yielded muffins that were extremely dense and a little dry.  The second time I made it, I added 1/4 cup of the cooled cherry water, and it made the muffins lighter and fluffier - more like a cupcake, which I loved. *Dried cherries can be more tart. I like that; if you don\u2019t, try an extra 1/4 cup of sugar.",
