I may change the name and just say surprise Strawberry Jelly to make it more appealing for gifts. Thanks;)",

I used 4 1/2 cups of sugar and it is still very sweet. I will probably cut it to 4 cups next time. I wasn't sure if one package of Jello would make it set up so I threw in another package of plain gelatin. I also used 4 packets of \"True Orange\" a crystallized orange powder I just found and fell in love with. I had to cook the zuchinni for 3 hours on a low simmer until it turned clear. I'm going to label it Mock Orange/Pineapple Marmalade. My boyfriend had to admit that it was absolutely unrecognizable as a zuchinni-based product.",
