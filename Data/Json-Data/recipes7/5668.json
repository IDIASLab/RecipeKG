                "reviewBody": "This was a tasty treat. I wasn't able to come by the cardamom pods (sadly) so I had to use a small amt of ground cardamom. I also reduced the lemon to 1 tbsp. After whipping up the cream I did not like it without sugar so I had to add about 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar. Because of the lemon and lack of sugar in the whipped topping I went with 4 stars. It was easy to make. I did not assemble the whole cake at once as I didn't want it to get soggy. It worked well to serve piece by piece. The cake is definitely not made to be eaten alone so be sure to have enough strawberries and whipped topping to go around! thanks for a lovely - 'grown up' dessert.",
