I followed this recipe to the letter didn't get much of a rise at 20 minutes the top and cake sides were overly browned the bottom burned and it stuck when I tried to get it out of the pan after sitting for 2 hours. Putting those things aside it tasted good. It looked so pitiful that I sliced it added a layer of SF lemon pudding and topped with some sliced strawberries Putting those things aside it tasted good. Just have to wonder if 425 is simply too high a temperature. I liked the taste of this well enough that I'm going to try it again at 375 and hopefully eliminate the issues that I had this time.",
