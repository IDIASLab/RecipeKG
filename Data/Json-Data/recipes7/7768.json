I omitted the mushrooms and cut the parsley to 1/4 cup added two cups of fresh tomatoes and put all the herbs into the blender with a can of diced tomatoes and pured it. Instead of olive oil I browned some hamburger and added onions and garlic sauteing them in the grease while the ground beef cooked. Didnt have bell peppers and added salt to taste after all the ingredients were added together. Just waiting now to see if it cooks down (thickens) but the flavor is spot on! Awesome recipe for just a bunch on ingredients from my fridge pantry and cabinet!",

I cut this down, just a bit (ran out in garden) but still tasted great.  I did, however, not include the mushrooms, again because I was out, & grocery store is 14 mi. away.  However, I can only imagine they would have only made the dish better.  I used fresh tomatoes, rather than canned because Istill have tons.  Just for the record though, for those who added meat, or sausage, a Marinara sauce, by definition, is a meatless red sauce.  When you add meat, you are making spaghetti.  HTH!!!  Blessings!!!",

Next time since adding the eggplant to \"dilute\" the sauce I'll use puree or crushed & more up to double the spices. I'll blend in halves too. It all fit in the blender but blending made it orange-y. Maybe blending in halves it won't be so orange.:?:) Time2: less orange but orange.:) 'Used crushed. Shoulda been sauce.

                "reviewBody": "I made this exactly as written. Yep even with 8oz of mushrooms 2Tablespoons oregano and a cup of flat leaf parsley. So yummy!! A perfect blend of spicy with a full body of flavors I feel you can only get with using all the mushrooms. I did 3 dashes of black pepper but next time will only do 1 per my tastes. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!! Great recipe!",
