Used 1-1/4 cup of sugar because of the extra wine. Cooked them in the wine about 30 minutes turning a couple of times to get even color. Took about 30 minutes to reduce the syrup. Put them cold on a plate with the cold syrup and added a dollop of Creme Fraiche on each. Yum! Everyone raved about them.",
