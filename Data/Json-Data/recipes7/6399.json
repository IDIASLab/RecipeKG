I used greek yogurt, and treacle (or molasses) instead of the white sugar for a little added depth of flavor.  It took quite a bit more milk than called for to make a workable dough.\r\n\r\nIf you slash the top deeply it will create four distinct squares of bread, very handy for serving and slicing.  If you don't slash it deeply it will need to cook longer, at least 5 minutes, or the center will still be gooey.",

I made this brown bread as the recipe is written except, instead of shaping the dough into one round loaf, I divided it into thirds and baked it in 3 mini loaf pans (3 1/4 \" x 6\"). I baked the mini-loaves for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. The crumb of this delicious bread is dense and even, making for beautiful slices. I served it with the \"Best Cream of Potato Soup\" from this site and got raves from my husband.",
