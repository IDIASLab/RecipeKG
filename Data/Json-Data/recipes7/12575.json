I also combined all the wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately and then added them together because I feel like it makes sure everything is mixed together more accurately. I used a 9X13 glass baking dish and adjusted the temperature to 325\u00b0 instead of 350\u00b0 because glass heats up faster than metal. It took about 35 minutes to cook. The cornbread came out really tastey. Still not very banana-y flavored which is good, but so moist and heavy. Good with a cup of coffee or tea! I would definitley make it again.",

I halved the recipe, baked at 400\u00b0F for 10 minutes, and ended up with 30 mini muffins.  The recipe doesn't state what to do with the banana, but I assumed it was to be ripe and  mashed.  I'm sure part of the reason these muffins are so moist is the banana, but that flavor is subtle.  My banana  was VERY ripe and sweet, and I did cut back the sugar because we like things less sweet (personal taste preference).  These turned out perfectly tender, full of flavor,  and are very simple to make, so thumbs up in this house.",
