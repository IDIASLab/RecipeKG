I used one bag bittersweet chocolate chips and one bag semi-sweet to try and balance the two. It is fairly sweet (which I love) but if you don't have a real strong sweet tooth it probably wouldn't hurt to cut back on the sugar a little. The ice cream by itself is very tasty but it also feels like a blank canvas to add any of your other favorite ice cream toppers like nuts or whipped cream (toffee bits sounds like a great idea!) and I really wish I could make waffle cones because for some reason I imagine this ice cream going perfectly in one.",

I just enjoyed a serving and am torn between a 4 & 5 star rating. It's GREAT but the bittersweet chips make it a bit too bitter for us. I'm not sure if it's just a personal taste issue or what. When I make this again I'll try it w/either semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips. I used a home brewed Irish Stout which added some nice flavor. The chips don't fully blend leaving an awesome little bit of texture kind of like in a good vanilla bean ice cream. Don't be afraid of the beer-def give this a whirl!
