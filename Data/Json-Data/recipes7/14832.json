The frosting part of this recipe makes at least twice if not three times as much frosting as needed even when being generous with the icing. Other than that the cupcakes are great. They have a nice mellow spice flavor and aroma. The cupcakes are moist and light tasting. The frosting has a wonderful flavor and is a perfect match for the cupcakes. My only complaint is that the recipe makes way too much frosting.",

The batter was very thick like brownies the cake didn't raise (made a 9x13 cake instead of cupcakes) and it was very dense. Will try again but I'm thinking it needs an extra egg baking soda vs powder and maybe some milk to thin the batter. Great flavor and really doesn't need frosting with as sweet as it was on it's own.",
