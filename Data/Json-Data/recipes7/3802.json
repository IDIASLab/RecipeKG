I used green greek olives and added some sundried tomatoes at the submitter's suggestion. I think I would use darker olives next time so you can see them better. We had this with greek lamb stew which went really nicely. I'm going to use the second loaf for muffeletta sandwiches - yum! Thanks for the recipe!",
