I browned the meat but I had browned it after I seasoned it so whatever came off in pan once I had the veggies and meat in the crock pot I just sprinkled more over everything in the pot later. Since I had started it an hour early I just put it on low for 2.5 hours then on high for 2.5 hours. Once it was finished I took the meat out of the pot onto a cutting board to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing it; my meat was cooked through and moist.",
