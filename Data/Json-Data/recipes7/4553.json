Living in Rochester there are slight variations to the recipe and taste but for the most part this hit the nail on the head. I would suggest using a white wine sauce if you want a lighter sauce. Also possibly doubling up on the sauce since there isn't alot. Next time I make this, I will be sure to make a double amount of sauce. Several people also take fresh lemons, slice them and saute them in the sauce as well for a more Lemony flavor.  Overall, Great recipe.  I also suggest pounding out the chicken. the thinner it is, the better for this recipe. At least in my opinion!",

I doubled the sauce, and used a bit more sherry and butter, that's just my taste. I also used chicken stock because I didn't have base.  I deglazed the pan with the sherry before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I also like the chicken on the thin side, so I pounded it thin. Maybe the reviewer who had the problem with the coating didn't dust off all the extra flour?  Great recipe, do you have one for greens and beans Roc style?!",

For second part I use a Riesling or Chardonnay instead of Dry Sherry.I use a good quality Box wine.( Always nice to have some around for drinking.) Heat on Low/med heat. Add chicken to pan. Then add the Wine next Lemon/sugar mix. Next add good amount of Butter on top Cover When butter is melted Dish is done! Excellent Enjoy!",
