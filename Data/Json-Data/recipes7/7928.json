I used pork, so I used a teaspoon of chicken bouillon granules instead of a cube of beef bouillon. Also to save myself a pot to clean, I cooked the meat first, in the sauce, with the oil and water chestnuts with liquid, added. Added the stir fry veggies once the meat was mostly cooked through, and cooked until heated through. I thought it could use some extra flavor so I added curry powder, ginger, cinnamon, and garlic powder, to taste, and a teeny amount of crushed red pepper. Served over drained ramen noodles that were flavored with a packet of chicken seasoning. Garnished with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. This made a great, cheap meal. Next time I'll be sure and add a can of mushrooms, and it would taste good with sesame oil, if you have any. I was out and used canola. It would be good over rice, as well.",

To save time on the meat, I buy \"stew meat\" so that it's already chopped up, and half those pieces to make them a tiny bit smaller. My family also prefers peppers over other veggies in a stir fry, so I buy one fresh green bell pepper, one fresh red bell pepper, one fresh yellow bell pepper, one fresh orange bell pepper, and one onion, all sliced. Those all together account for about three servings, so I freeze the other two for later. I cook the veggies in olive oil the same, but add the meat that's been sitting in sauce right in-- no wasted pans and it turns out great each time. One change I made to the sauce was to shake a generous amount of crushed red pepper into it. It gives it a tiny kick. Overall, I'm glad I found this recipe and will continue to make it!",
