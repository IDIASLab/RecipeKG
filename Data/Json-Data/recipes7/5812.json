Add a little cold water to the cornstarch in a separate cup or bowl mixing rapidly so it is just a white cornstarch liquid. No dry specs.

After about fifteen minutes of initial cook time, I added the starch and blended. It thickened immediately, and I let it simmer on low an additional three or four minutes, enough time to cook away the corn starch taste. Turned out very well, and I was extremely pleased with this recipe. The only caveat I have is not to overfill your pie shell, because this filling lifted my covered pie top and leaked out of the edges. A little goes a long way!",
