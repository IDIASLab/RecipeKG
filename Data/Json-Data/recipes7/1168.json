First of all there is NO WAY this recipe will fit into an 8x8 pan. Must go into a 9x13 pan. Second I took some other peoples advice and put the caramel on top of the apples, not on top of the crumb topping, would recommend doing that! On the bag of caramels I used it had a recipe for caramel apples, which said to add 4 tablespoons of regular milk to each 48 caramels so I did that rather than open a whole can of evap. milk and waste what I didn't use, and it was just fine. With a few changes, will definitely make this recipe again. YUM!YUM!!",

I have a few suggestions for everyone.  use a ziploc bag.  make the filling, peel and cut the apples then add the apples to the ziploc bag pour in the filling and let marinate while you finish with the rest of the recipe.  apples and sauce can even be made the night before and refrigerated.  dont forget to double the lemon juice and cinnamon for the sauce. Instead of using flour use vanilla pudding, one box is a half cup. homemade caramel is the best and easiest way to go, medium high heat in a large saucepan stick of butter, cup of sugar and 1.25 cups of heavy cream added slowly and after the sugar turns a nice golden brown.  you will have some left over that can be put in a jar and used on ice cream or French toast, mmmm.  half the crumble recipe and add a dash of cinnamon.  instead of water for the sauce use another liquid i.e. brandy, heavy cream, cider.  the last 10 - 15 minutes of bake time sprinkle 1/4 - 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to the top, its adds a great crunch.",

One, the pan needs to be larger and should be sprayed with pam or greased first, second the caramel definitely needs to go on top of the apple mixture before the crumb topping.  I used caramal syrup, the kind you would put on ice cream, and just warmed it in the microwave (lid off) to warm it so it would be easier to pour, it took about half a bottle.  This is delicious served hot with whipped cream on top, my family loved it!",

I also doubled the lemon juice, omitted the water and added Mexican vanilla. I poured pre-made caramel sauce - about a 1/4 cup - over the apples and then put the crumble mixture on. It came out great...sweet but not overpowering. The top was crispy and the apple mixture was a perfect texture (not mushy at all). The taste was spot on. I served it warm with a drizzle of caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! I will add this to my list of seasonal apple recipes. Thank you, St. Matthew First Graders!",

There was no \"Crisp\" because of the caramel (we used a tub of fat-free caramel apple dip). If I made it again I'd add more spice (apple pie spice) to the apples and layer the caramel below the crisp. I would use the caramel apple dip again though. Oh and the tip to line the pan with foil to avoid a messy clean-up is a good one!",
