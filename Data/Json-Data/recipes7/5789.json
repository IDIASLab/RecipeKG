There really is no need to whip cream prior to churning - the churn process adds air to the mix already and it is just an extra step. I whisked 1 cup cream into the avocado puree. I substituted one can coconut milk for the evaporated milk and added one cup of milk to the blender with the avocado sugar and lime juice (which I reduced to 1/4 cup). I added 1 more cup milk directly to the saucepan making the custard along with the coconut milk condensed milk and 1 scraped vanilla bean. Taste was wonderful. I rated the recipe based on original. I rate it 4 stars with modifications.",
