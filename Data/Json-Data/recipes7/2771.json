It IS thick - pumkin and pudding mix do that.  For those of you in the future who get worried, don't!  \n*****\nSome people have commented on the difficulty of finding crystalized ginger.  It's the same as candied ginger, sugared ginger, or ginger chips - they are all just different names/sizes.  The two best places I can always find it, and really inexpensively, are Publix, in the bulk items ($5 a pound) and World Market - $3 for a jar or the ginger chips by the Ginger People (they sell them on their website, too, but they are a little more$).\n*****\nIf you are getting more of a muffin than a cupcake, you're not creaming your sugar and butter long enough.  It should be really fluffy.  You'll probably want to scoop the batter into the tins.",

I made a couple of modifications: (1) instead of using 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce; and (2) I only used 3 large eggs, not 4.  Also, usually when I bake cupcakes, I lightly spray the inside of the foil with vegetable oil so the cupcakes don't stick too much to the wrapper.  Baked them for twenty minutes.  I used a vanilla frosting and then decorated them with Halloween themed sprinkles.  I think these would be perfect for a holiday party.  They are scrumptious - so moist!  Thank you for the recipe.  I will also make them around Thanksgiving.",

Go on and add the dry ingredients and the lumps will disappear. I left out the crystallized ginger (couldn't find it) so upped the ginger to 1/2 tablespoon. The first time I made this recipe I baked it in a bundt pan for about 45 minutes then frosted it with tinted store bought cream cheese frosting to look like a pumpkin- covered an ice cream cone in green frosting for the stem. The cake turned out really really well- so moist and with great flavor and really cute. The second time I actually made it into cupcakes! I frosted the cupcakes with cream cheese frosting made by beating together 8 oz softened cream cheese 1/2 cup softened salted butter 3 1/2-4 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 tablespoon butter flavoring. I know the butter flavoring sounds bizarre but it somehow mellows out and brings the other flavors together. The wonderful frosting on the fantastic cupcakes made these some of the best cupcakes I've ever had!",

The cupcakes baked up nicely too.  But... first of all, the yield is off - this recipe makes more than 24 cupcakes, so plan ahead. Second, 20 minutes is not enough cooking time.  Plan on about five minutes longer.  Last, and most important, while the flavor is wonderful, in large part because of the peppery, crystallized ginger, the texture is a little \"gummy,' for lack of a better word.  A little TOO moist, maybe, and even a little too sweet - I suspect the pudding mix is the culprit. I'm sure this recipe, minus the pudding mix, would produce a far better result.",
