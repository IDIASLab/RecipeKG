I cut them into small slices instead of cubes and used a little less than the 1/2 c sugar. In making this again I would certainly use less melted butter on top-maybe half?. The cantaloupe taste was well disguised (my husband guessed peach first) but not entirely absent, and the texture/appearance was quite nice.  I'd make it again.",

I only used 1/2 stick lite butter total (1tbsp went in cantaloupe mix the rest on top of cake mix). I used 1/3 c splenda and just a spoonful of sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. The flavor was amazingly better than I expected and I agree that it was kind of like a peach cobbler. Disguised the cantaloupe good enough which is what I was looking for because I was tired of eating cantaloupe. The top didn't get crunchy at all though. Next time I would add some oatmeal to the topping maybe some nuts and maybe a different kind of cake mix as orange was a bit too articially sweet. This was a unique recipe and could be tweaked to be really good I think.",
