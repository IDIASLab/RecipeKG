As directed, I let the pickled onions marinate for 4 hours and then the coleslaw itself for another 3 hours.  Step #2 tells you to mix in half of the pickled onions, but it doesn\u2019t tell you what to do with the other half???  The onions were sooooo good that I just added all of them to the coleslaw. The cumin brings a new flavor to coleslaw and is tempered nicely with the sweetness from the sugar.   Totally different coleslaw that was totally enjoyed!",
