So I used half evaporated milk 1/2 regular milk and 1 tbls butter melted. I slowly added this to the creamed mixture and it still turned out WONDERFUL! I will use the heavy cream next time. As for the freezing time I found if you freeze it uncovered it froze faster and more evenly. It was huge hit at our dinner party. We will be making this regularly!",

I did a few things different. First I added 1 Tsp vanilla to the egg mixture.I also doubled the crust & used a 9x13 pan. Next I used raspberry jam instead of frozen as it was all I had on hand. I got many raves but in my opinion the frozen raspberries would be better because it wouldn't be as sweet as jam! Thanks!",
