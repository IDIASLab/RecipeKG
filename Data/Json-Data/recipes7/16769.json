I don't have a griddle. I tried to make them in my fry pan and it was very difficult. They stuck (crusted on) to my no-stick Green Pan forcing me to switch to other no-stick pans where they stuck again. The trick to making them work seemed to be LOTS of oil and literally a smoking hot pan. So.....I recommend making this recipe on a griddle as per the recipe instructions.
