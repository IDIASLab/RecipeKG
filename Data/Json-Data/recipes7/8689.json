A couple of things that are not mentioned in the recipe but are in the video - first Chef John used a mortar and pestle to grin the caraway seeds - well let me tell you caraway does not like to be crushed, but this is really an essential part of the recipe, if you have a spice grinder - use it, otherwise be prepare for some heavy duty crushing with the mortar and pestle.  Also, cool the skillet between doing the onions and toasting the spices - I came dangerously close to burning those preciously ground spices!  The video recommends simmering with the lid off - which I did and is probably also why the neighbors came asking about dinner.  This was a rich and beautiful stew - company worthy for sure, especially on a cold fall or winter evening.",

Went light on the cayenne pepper. (Chef John's nothing without his red pepper!) This was simple, delectable and even better the next day. Served over buttered egg noodles. Will make again! Thanks Chef John! Highly recommended, and I would encourage the grinding of the caraway along with the use of fresh marjoram if at all possible.",

We think the noodles and sour cream tamed the spice for us. I was afraid at first it was going to be a little too vinegary but when it was done....nope. It was really tasty and perfect for a cold night. Smelled great while simmering but be sure to keep it at a simmer with no lid so it reduces properly. A keeper in this house for sure.",

Be sure to watch the goulash the last 10-15 minutes.  You want to make sure the liquid has cooked down enough but not too much that it burns.  Great recipe, Chef John!",
