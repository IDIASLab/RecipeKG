I wanted the taste of restaurant cheesecake, but something simple to prepare--because I did not want to measure the sour cream, I dumped in the whole container. I also did not want to bake for an hour, so that is where the 30 minute shut-off of the oven comes into play. I shut off the oven and do not open door for 6 hours or leave in oven all night. This will get you great reviews from friends. You also will not order cheesecake out again. If it cracks, garnish with fruit to hide the cracks.",

I admit, I was skeptical about the baking method as well as the large amount of sour cream for just two packages of cream cheese. But you were right - this turned out perfectly just as you said it would! This is a light and creamy cheesecake, far different from some of the more dense, heavy and kind of dry  cheesecakes. You were right on about the cheesecake not cracking too! Your recipe is perfect for any baker, novice or experienced. For my own preference, however, the crust was a little thicker than I would like, so next time it will be easy enough to cut it back to maybe one cup of crumbs to suit my tastes, but others may like it just as is. Delicious on it's own or with any variety of toppings, I served this with Supreme Strawberry Topping, recipe also from this site.  I'm so happy your wonderful recipe got published - not just for you, but for the hundreds of home bakers I know are going to be pleased with it too!",

First attempt at a real-real cheesecake and honestly, I don't know why I was so worried about making one. It's really not all that difficult. I followed the directions exact. When the cheesecake was finished cooling, I spread Supreme Strawberry Topping all over the top, as my sister in law LOVES strawberry cheesecake. No idea how it tastes, but just because it was so simple and not scary to prepare, it's earned all five stars. I'll update my review once I hear from my SIL how much she loved it. NOTE: She loved it, as did my brother in law. Rock on! This one's a keeper.",

You can change up the recipe and use different things for the crust, shortbread cookies or oreos come to mind.  You can also add different flavors to the cheesecake, use my recipe as a base and have some fun!  I recently have discovered for a short cut if I add another cup of sour cream to the recipe and use the 2 of the ready made crusts.  I have a great dessert really quick for a carryin or party.  Remember it freezes well, freeze in slices for a special treat.  Enjoy!  ",

This cheesecake could be spectacular - for someone who likes very light, airy cheesecake.  My husband and I prefer a denser, NY-type cake.  I knew this wasn't going to be incredibly dense by the ratio of cream cheese and sour cream, but I guess I didn't expect it to be SO very light.  It was very easy to throw together and neither of us is complaining about having to eat the rest of it, but I won't make it again.  So 4 stars for what it is: a light, airy, fluffy, tangy *slightly* reminiscent of a pudding dessert, but 3 stars for what it was in comparison to what we consider a cheesecake.",
