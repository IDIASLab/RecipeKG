I had never heard of Sekanjabin before but I googled it and now I know...But anyway I was afraid to use the white balsamic vinegar but it is SO GOOD! my 2 year old daughter loves it! It is perfect prepared as written. The strawberry taste is great. The store had Pear infused white balsamic as well as Raspberry infused for the same price and I think that may taste good as well. Thanks!",

I made it with the same quantities, but my kids found the ginger nad lenmon flavour too strong, so I made the same thing (but a lesser quantity) omitting the lemon and ginger, let it rest overnight with the balsamic vinegar, and added this to the first sekanjabin. The result is a fuller strawberry flavour, with the wonderful after-taste of lemony-ginger. HMM! Thank you for sharing. ",
