The reason that I only gave this 4 stars is that my mom's was better. She used to use a lot more macaroni and she didn't use apples or raisins. I felt like 2 boxes of raisins was too much. Also my mom used to shred the carrots instead of dicing them and I think she added diced boiled egg. It tasted pretty sweet too with all the fruit so I wouldn't add the sugar next time.",

I will make a small amount of this to get my answer. Also there was no apple in the salad but I definitely remember the pineapple and the salad being on the sweet and savory side.
