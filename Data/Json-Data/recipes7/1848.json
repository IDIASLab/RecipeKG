Since then I have decided that i like the way the cookies look much better when i use red gel food color from the craft store. I just keep adding little dabs of color and mixing until i get the perfect color. And I roll the cookie balls in the red decorator sugar before they are cut into sixths for the petals...In my original recipe i also said that i baked the cookies on sheets lined with aluminum foil (dull side up so as not to burn the cookies!) so that I could peel them off easier after baking. Hope this helps because when done right these cookies are such a pretty and yummy addition to any christmas cookie tray.",

I like pink pointsettias. I also used mini chocolate chips or peanut butter chips in the middle instead of the icing. Next time I will reserve a bit of dough color it yellow and roll up tiny balls to press in the middle before baking. In order to get the pretty shape you need to first make the slices in the dough ball then gently pull the pieces out from the center. They will look like flowers before you bake them so keep working with the dough ball to work the petals into the shape you want before baking. They do not unfold on their own during baking so you need to do that before.",

My cookies did not flatten like the ones in the picture but stayed in more or less the shape of a ball. I had to bake much longer than the recipe instructed. The end result was a very unattactive and not too tasty cookie. I didn't even bother with the yellow dots. No one raved about these cookies. One friend said \"I kind of liked them \" and I gave him the remainder of the batch. Maybe I did something wrong? I followed the recipe to a T.
