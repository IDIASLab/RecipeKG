These are the changes I made - partly out of necessity and partly because I am health-conscious! - I used unsweetened applesauce - Heaping 1/2 cup brown sugar only (omitted white). - 1 whole egg and 1/2 of a banana mashed - handful of sesame seeds - 1/4 cup walnuts and 1/4 sunflower seeds - 1/2 cup white and milk chocolate chips (no craisins or raisins on hand). - whole wheat flour Because I improvised a bit I ended up having an overly sticky dough at the end so added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I made the cookies quite large (1 1/2 dozen) and so baked them for 10 minutes. Perfect! The result is a very yummy and pretty healthy cookie - one I don't feel bad about allowing my two year old to have. Next time I may cut the brown sugar back again to just 1/2 cup... and keep the rest of my changes:)",

I also used a 1/2 cup of splenda in place of the sugar and only 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. I'm not a fan of nuts in my cookies so I left them out.
