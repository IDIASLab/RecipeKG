The bake time was WAY too long for us we will keep testing in that time range. We used 1/3 cup cocoa powder and added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the water for richer flavor. We are a huge cheese cake family so next time we will use 1 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of the full amount. Although the recipe is good we would have preferred to taste more cheese cake. As written this is a 4 star recipe (if you adjust the bake time). The changes make it 5 star for our family's taste preferences. The bottom line: these mini cupcakes will not disappoint.",
