The flavor may be a little off the texture may be weird the cooking time may be wrong but their is usually something that I do like. Let me also say that I love chai. I drink chai every morning so I really thought that I was going to like these cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly. The batter turned out to be watery not just wet but watery. After pouring it into the liners I baked it for 20 minutes and checked them. Not done so left in another 5 minutes not done. After 30 minutes of baking I removed them. They collapsed within minutes. I don't even know how to describe the texture. It's like a really soggy cupcake - like goo in a cupcake liner. I would say tht maybe I did something wrong but I have baked a lot of cupcakes and never had anything like this happen before. I was going to top these with the chai frosting from this site but didn't even want to waste my ingredients trying to save these cupcakes. Sorry!",

I upped all the dry stuff especially the chi tea which I let steep for a bit longer and did without the vanilla because I did not have any and added two eggs. I debated adding the yogurt but ending up throwing it in last second then added flour until I got a nice texture. They came out a beautiful color with a nice spongy texture not too moist at all. (If your batter is too soupy add flour of course!) They really did taste like chi. If yours did not next time use an extra tea bag and steep for longer. I will be making these again.",
