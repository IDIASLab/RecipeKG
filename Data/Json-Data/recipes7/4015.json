I wanted a richer flavor so I used a can of evaporated milk and just added 2% milk up to the two cup mark. I took The Bunny Chef's tip and used two tablespoons peanut butter instead of two teaspoons. These froze up nicely I just used dixie cups with popsicle sticks stuck into them. I think the peanut butter could even be doubled again to four tablespoons for next time. These turned out a very good cold treat.",

I had no problems with the peanut butter separating. I used Skippy and I used a heaping tablespoon because I knew we would want a stronger PB flavor. Maybe the separation occurs with the natural peanut butters but another thought is to only warm the PB just enough to blend into the pudding. This would be a fun recipe to experiment with different flavor combinations and I plan on trying sugar free pudding to see if that will work. Great fun thanks John!",
