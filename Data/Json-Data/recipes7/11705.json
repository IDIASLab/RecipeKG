I cooked the pork until it was cooked through and then some, but there was still quite a bit of liquid in the pan. I baked the butternut squash rather than boiled -- a million times easier to cut, peel and mash! All in all, it was really good. I wish I had salted the pork prior to cooking, and next time, I will cook the pork in the bacon grease or clarified butter instead of plain veggie oil. The different flavors really blended surprisingly well.",

I used half the brown sugar and it was sweet enough for us. I also steamed chopped onions with the squash rather than using onion powder. Chops are a bit tough when pan-fried. I may try the same concept but using pork roast done in the slow cooker or maybe even using pan-fried duck breast with balsamic vinaigrette glaze for the meat on the bottom. Thank you for this great recipe.",
