I agree with other reviewers who said that it didn't taste as exotic as you might expect given the ingredients but it was very flavorful and the sauce was very rich. The sweet potatoes and carrots were a perfect compliment to the sauce. This would not have fit in my slow cooker so I did it in the oven as explained in my review. I also made a few modifications to the method which worked out great. I made this a day ahead and it was delicious! A great alternative to the standard pot roast. My 3 and 5 year olds liked it too. A few modifications: Used brown sugar and reduced to 1 Tbsp Used 3 fist-sized potatoes (cut in 1/2) 1 big sweet potato (cut in 1/4s) & 2 carrots for the veggies. Browned meat. Remove. Saute onions and celery together in the fat. Then add all spices (NOT flour) for 1 minute. Then add flour and stir constantly for 1 more minute. Deglaze with about 1/2 cup red wine. Then add tomato sauce. Boil. Then add meat. Bake just the meat/onion mixture in oven at 325 for 3 hrs periodically adding more water. Add veggies reduce to 300 and cook 1 hour more.",

However when I stumbled upon this recipe this morning I was thrilled to see a recipe that included some different almost \"exotic\" spices/flavors. I loved it and it turned out well even though I messed up the cooking method (mixed the flour chopped onion and all spices in with the tomato sauce which resulted in a paste..oops). It all cooked down nicely however and everyone enjoyed it. I really liked the new flavors and will make it again. My husband who is a \"no frills try nothing new\" guy liked it but wasn't as thrilled about it as I was. I think you have to be a little daring to really LOVE this recipe...but nevertheless everyone still enjoyed it and had seconds.",

It was really good! The roast came out so juicy and tender and my husband and 3 sons all had second servings!! The flavor of the sauce reminds me a lot of Cincinnati Chile and I loved it. It was a very pleasant change of pace from our regular old pot roast. Thanks for a really good recipe.",

The flavoring is just right and no particular spice strikes a prominent or discordant note in the sauce. My roommate who loves pot roast and traditional flavors thought this was delicious. I cut the roast into three sections to help it cook more thoroughly. Next time I'll add more carrots and celery since there was lots of sauce and a bit of extra space in my crockpot. What a great change from my usual pot roast!",
