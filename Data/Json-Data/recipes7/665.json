I did not have red pepper flakes so I left those out and didn't miss them. This may be obvious but you need to grill these on lightly greased foil or the apples and onions will fall through the grill. You don't want to miss any of them because they are a perfect compliment to the pork chops! Really delicious!",

To finish I put the apple mixture and cheese on the chops under the broiler until the cheese melted. The pork was sooo tender.
