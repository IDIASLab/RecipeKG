My friend Myong was kind enough to share her recipe and technique with me.  Some ingredients may not be readily available in your local supermarket.  Look for Kimchi (Fish) Sauce and Korean chili powder in Asian markets or online. Use kimchi in stir fries or your favorite Korean dishes.",

Most grocery stores with an asian section now carry fish sauce, though it is generallt labled \"Thai\" fish sauce. Even after much rinsing of the cabbage this recipe was so salty that if any fermentation took place the tingle was lost in the brine. So then... I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the salt in half. This still drew out the water beautifully. I also like a bit more ginger in my Kimchi, so I omitted the ground ginger and added 2 (1\") pieces of sliced dried ginger and 2 Tbsp of diced crystalized (candied/ sugared) ginger. Also added a Tbsp of whole black peppercorns. After 4 days in the closet and a day in the 'fridge the Kimchee was bubbly and yummy! This was very easy to make, and the ingredients are inexpensive. I won't be going back to the jar stuff from the grocery store! I understand every Korean Kimchi maker has his/her secret recipe, so just keep adjusting yours until you find what you like!  ",

There are milder recipes out there, some with low sodium.  \"Fish sauce\" is a rather non-specific ingredient.  Since I'm allergic to shrimp, I usually try to find the kind which doesn't contain shrimp, even though it is usually a primary ingredient in kimchi.  Kimchi is an acquired taste for some people.  I hated it at first, but even so, I kept craving it.  I now eat it every day.  It is super-healthy and low calorie.  Korean food in general is great if you are trying to lose weight!",

How do you spoil fermented (spoiled) cabbage? Anyway, it tasted great, but I didn't feel like eating two quarts of kimchee that quickly. My friends were happy with that. If you have ever heard the term \"kimchi breath\" you'll know what I mean. As a previous reviewer stated, I hated kimchee at first, particularly the smell of it. But now I crave it. I'll eat it with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By the way, a serving is like a quarter cup. Small, but loaded with flavor.",

                "reviewBody": "I can fix the saltiness issue.  I've made kimchi a few times and this recipe is very similar to the one I use and love.  After you rub the salt into the cabbage and let it sit for only about 30 minutes, you should then immerse the cabbage in a large bowl of water for 2 hours.  Put a dinner plate on the top to make sure all the cabbage is submerged.  The salt's role is to kill the bad bacteria and only add a teeny bit of flavor.  After it's done soaking rinse the cabbage very thoroughly.  I usually put it in a colander, rinse it well by hand and then rinse it in a water bath 2 or 3 times.  Changing the water each time.\n\nKimchi is one of those foods that takes a loooong time to make.  I usually put everything that this recipe has and some diakon matchsticks into a mason jar with a rubber seal in a cabinet for 3-5 days (pushing the contents below the surface of the brine everyday) and then refridgerate for a week.  Then, boom, it's kimche eating time!\n\nAdded a photo of mine just for the heck of it.  That's an 8 cup mason jar.  Larger than most.  Bud Ice is not part of the recipe, but when you complete everything at 2am, like I did that time, it might find its way into the photo.   :)",

I couldn't find Korean chile powder, but I did find hot pepper paste in the refrigerated section.  The label said it's from South Korea, so I thought that might do the trick and it has.  I used the amount of salt the recipe called for, and after rinsing it very well and squeezing out the extra water, it wasn't too salty.  Next time, I'm going to try adding salted shrimp and slices of jicama or asian radish, like other reviewers suggested.  I might also try subbing bok choy for the napa cabbage since it's a bit easier to come by, but very similar.  Anyway, I'm DEFINITELY going to make this again. Thank you for sharing!\n\nEdited to say BEWARE: The second time I made this, it sprayed all over the place when I opened it after waiting the four days the recipe calls for.  (It was like when you open a 2 liter of soda that's been shaken.) So, yes, beware! (It still tasted great, though.)",
