(I hope that makes sense I don't have iced tea powder so I had to make a quick change. I used ten regular sized no-tag tea bags but only a quart and a half of water when it brewed in the tea brewer.)When the tea was done I added the sugar frozen lemonade concentrate vanilla and almond extracts then two ice cube-makers worth of ice. After I added the ice I set the iced tea pitcher in the fridge for a couple hours until the ice had melted and the tea was cold. My husband and kids thought this was good but my husband thought that the almond was a little too overpowering. I thought this was too sweet. I'd like to make this again but cut the sugar back by half and maybe only use a teaspoon of almond extract. I think then it might be just right. Awesome change on your everyday glass of iced tea.",
