I couldn't decide which one to use so when I mixed up the batch I used half of both vodkas. Because it's such a simple recipe it can be made ahead of time. Use a mason jar with measurement lines and just fill to each line for however many servings you need. Make it the night before and store in the fridge. When you're ready to serve it it's nice and cold. Just shake and stir. This is really convenient if you are bringing some drinks to a get-together.",
