I did not have so much flax seeds so I added lightly roasted sesame seeds - grounded reduced the quantity of sugar to just one packed cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of White added some white chocolate chips and also a banana as I felt that the dough extremely dry. This moistened it and added a little extra flavour! The results were awesome! 36 cookies just vanished into thin air within a matter of minutes! Thank you so very much!! - TRUPTEE",

But the only changes was to sub out the sugar due to the fact that I have to carefully watch my sugar - so I substituted the butterscotch chips for dark chocolate and changed the regular sugar for Stevia. Even with these changes I do not believe I changed the overall taste and the cookies were really really good and since I love cookies - to be able to find one that I can eat that actually tastes good - I am in cookie heaven!! I am making them again and adding in raisins walnuts and unsweetened coconut to make them more of a breakfast cookie. Yum for me.",
