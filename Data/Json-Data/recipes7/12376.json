(We did add a small dash of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla to ours and next time I may cut the nutmeg just a TINY bit). But these were fantastic and turned out VERY fluffy! (after the batter sits in the bowl 5 min it's better) This recipe made us 3 large pancakes. (Also we were just a little shy of the required eggnog -which was just regular eggnog btw not really thick- so we added a bit of half & half cream which probably helped!)",
