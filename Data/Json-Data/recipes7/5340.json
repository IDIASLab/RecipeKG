It instructs the baker to use 2 TBSP of dough for each cookie. Those would be huge cookies and come nowhere near the 36 servings indicated as other reviewers have mentioned. 2 tsp. is more like it. This amount of dough made 30 cookies and each was filled nicely with the filling. I half expected the filling to spill over when baked but it didn't. I did use just one drop of food coloring and the color was just right. I am a little puzzled about the name of these as there is really nothing creamy about them. These would be a nice green dessert for St. Patrick's Day especially with a bit of green color added to the dough.",

Decided to double the zest in the filling and wished I had used zest in the cookie dough as well but...next time for more of a lime punch. Used Wilton's Christmas Green food coloring but only touched 1/2 an inch of a toothpick to the coloring with no scooping action. That was all that was needed for me to get a lime-ish green. It was a nice color before adding the food coloring with the specks of zest so it could be omitted completely. The filling is sweet enough. Great with coffee and tea.",
