You can sub the potatoes with sweet potatoes as mentioned by another reviewer. Did not notice any change in taste but I'll cut down the sugar due to sweetness from sweet potatoes. I'll usually brush these babies with some butter to give them a little shine when they come out fresh from the oven. So so good! Mmmmmmmmmmm!!",
