Comparing the two I think I actually like the original recipe best. The original pancakes puffed up nicely and although still a bit thin had a lighter more tender eggy taste. The ones with added flour are thicker but not as tender and the flour taste dominates more. The recipe is great as is! Don't be thrown off by the super thin batter.",
