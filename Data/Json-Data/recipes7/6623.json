There is a recipe for a very rich frosting. I did not make that. It calls for a 9x13 pan. I baked it in a 9\" bread pan. It probably came up half way and did not rise any higher. I had to bake it 50 minutes. Something is missing somewhere because it would not make two 9x13 cakes. I made 1/2 the recipe. Even my husband liked it. The second time I made it I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to the whole recipe and it rose a little more. I also baked in six mini loaf pans 30-35 minutes. Easy to freeze and share.",
