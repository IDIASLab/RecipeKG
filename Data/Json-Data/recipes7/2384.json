So in less than 15 minutes I whipped this up and I had one thrilled 4 year old. I only had whole milk on hand so I used that was low on vanilla extract so I added a tablespoon of instant vanilla pudding mix and I left out the strawberries. I'm sure the texture was changed a bit by using whole milk instead of half and half but it was still delicious!",
