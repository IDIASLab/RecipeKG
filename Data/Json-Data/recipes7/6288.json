Number two..make sure you cook them all before you take a break cuz in the 15 minutes it took for me to eat breakfast, the batter was flat and the remaining crepes/pancakes were greasy. Three....The amount of butter seems excessive (hence the greasy pancake when the batter had settled) so if I made them again I would add just a couple tablespoons of butter.",

I turned the milk into non-fat/skim, used 1 tbsp sugar (react to most fake sugars), took 1/4 c to 1 tbsp olive oil, and cut the egg yolk and just used egg whites (3 tbsp egg white purchased in a container equals a whole large egg).  I also used multi-grain for the regular flour. FOR those of you who are stuck like me wanting yummy things but needing to alter, this dropped a lot of calories. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to add more flavor and sweetening. And, best of all, using these basic techniques for changing out, worked wonderfully. I have a great non-stick pan, and didn't even have to grease it. I can still have crepes -- but the recipe above, for people who aren't on a health concern --  ENJOY!! They are wonderful.",

I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, so I put a bit of organic sugar in the food processor to make my own. Sprinkle them with the powdered sugar, top with whipped cream, and enjoy!

I made a few changes to make it dairy-free and a bit healthier: unsweetened almond milk in place of regular milk; 1 tbs. sugar + 3 packets of stevia in place of the 3 tbs. sugar; and 6 tbs. Smart Balance Light instead of the 1/2 cup butter.  I used my nonstick crepe pan, so no extra fat was needed for greasing.  I rolled up each pancake and topped them with a mixture of warmed and maple-sweetened blueberries and bananas.  My husband gobbled them up and requested them again, and I definitely agreed.  In fact, I think I'll be making them again this weekend!  Just remember that this is *not* something you can cook quickly, as each pancake has to be done invididually.  The batter comes together very quickly, the finished product . . . not so much : )",
