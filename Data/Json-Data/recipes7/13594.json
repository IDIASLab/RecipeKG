My wife absolutely raved about it. Was a bit unsure about serving it with ranch dressing but... it was the perfect dipping sauce for the shrimp. This one goes to the top of the favorites list and will be made many times both as a 'football snack' and as a main dish. Tonight we enjoyed it with shrimp cocktail before dinner and a nice Broccoli Au Gratin served in individual gratin bowls. Thanks for posting this awesome dish!",
