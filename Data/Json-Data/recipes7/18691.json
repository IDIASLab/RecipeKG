I enjoyed them as a healthy breakfast option. I substituted AP flour for the wheat four and 1 tsp pumpkin spice blend for the 1/4 tsp spices mentioned. I also added 1 tsp vanilla which I think gave this a little extra flavoring. Due to time restraints I used frozen diced butternut squash instead of fresh which was fantastic. I microwaved the squash according to the packet and then followed the directions from step 3. The squash did not mash easily with a fork but a potato masher did the trick. Overall a great healthy recipe!",
