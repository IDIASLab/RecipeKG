But we like really sweet stuff so I added in a total of 3 tablespoons of sugar,  reduced the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons, increased butter to four tablespoons and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  In my opinion they tasted like I HOP pancakes.  I'll never go out for pancakes ever.  Although I decreased the baking powder,  I think it's the baking powder amount and the resting of the batter that makes these the best fluffy pancakes ever.  Try it,  You will not be sorry.
