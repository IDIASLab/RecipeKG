I'm sure that's for the lemon juice to react with the baking powder/soda and to make it fluffier, which is exactly what happened. Good pancake recipe. NOTE: You might want to stick with buttermilk instead of soured milk with this recipe. Sure, soured milk works okay but your pancakes will be flatter. Or, that was my experiance the second time I made them.",

I also just let my batter rest for a few minutes (20mins) before hand to speed up this resting process I let my buttermilk and egg reach room temp before using.  The addition of the lemon juice is pure genius!  The lemon juice (citric acid) causes an exothermic reaction with the Baking Soda (sodium bicarbonate)....results...Bubbles! This makes for lots of fluffy airy pancakes...This is why I love baking...it's like being in chemistry class but with edible results:-)",
