The original recipe was savory and comes from Eastern Europe and dates back more than 1,000 years.  This particular recipe is most likely a variation of a recipe brought over to the new world by German/Dutch immigrants.",

I cut the butter in half and omit the cheddar cheese (I just don't see how it would go well with cheddar cheese). I've added orange marmalade when I didn't have enough apricot preserves and I'm sure that you can substitute apriot preserves for any other preserves.",
