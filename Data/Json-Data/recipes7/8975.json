I wanted a different style of white bread and the yogurt intrigued me. I didn't want a fruity flavor (and only had plain yogurt anyway) so I used that and nixed the vanilla. I used low fat Greek style plain yogurt. I found this dough to require less flour than the recipe called for; I believe I used somewhat less than 3 cups to get a good consistency. I also didn't use a bread machine as I prefer to knead by hand; the dough was very heavy and dense when I kneaded it. I also think I should have let the yogurt warm first as I think the cold yogurt caused the bread to rise slowly. The bread itself (I made rolls) was dense moist mildly tart/yogurt flavored tender and lightly chewy. It worked well as dinner rolls served with butter and honey. If I made this again I would warm the yogurt first and try it with butter instead both for the flavor and for the contrast between the chewy inside and what would be a crispier outside.",

I am planning on making french toast with it as well.",
