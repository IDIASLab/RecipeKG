The only deviation was using 3/4 cup sugar and at the end I was tasting and adding small amounts of agave nectar until I had a sweet tart kind of experience.  Took a little longer to cook for me but that tends to happen with le cruset pots. Waiting to see how the lemon bars I made with the curd will turn out!",

I couldn't believe it was so simple. Because I didn't have a zester I carefully peeled the zest off with a paring knife, being careful not to get the bitter white pith. After juicing the lemons I put 1/2 cup juice into a blender with the zest and liquefied it, then added it back to the pot of lemon juice. I carefully followed the directions but doubled the recipe. After the mixture thickened I poured it into canning jars and processed in a water bath canner for 20 minutes. I used 1/2 pint wide-mouth  Ball canning jars. The result is incredible, tangy with a delightful rich sweetness. Better then the store bought imported curd I've been buying. I will always use this recipe and make my own from now on. I plan on giving the jars as Christmas presents with blueberry scone mix I will make myself. Thank you so much, Marti. Your recipe rocks!",
