I used 3 cups of white sugar and two of brown sugar. I added a whole bulb of garlic. I also wanted to add just a little heat so I put in ten jalapeno peppers, five with seeds and five without. I think the final mustard turn out perfect with a little heat but not a lot.\nIt's been about 3 or 4 years since my first post. Due to the fact flour is not recommended for canning I have started using Clear gel. The Clear gel works great and there is no clumping to deal with. I substitued 3/4 cup of Clear gel for the flour in the recipe. Clear gel can be found on Amazon.",

Tips for people using this recipe--as mentioned, it yields 16 - 8oz jars.  Don't worry about chopping up the peppers too much in the food processor, they cook down.  I added one jalapeno and kept the seeds in to make it spicier.  I put the water/flour mix in a quart jar and shook it up, that worked well and I didn't have any trouble with chunks that way.  Had to get it out with a small rubber scrapper though as it does get thick!  Otherwise recipe was great!",

All are wonderful but the favorite hands down was our 3rd half batch. Here are our modifications: 10 banana peppers we processed until smoothish while the other 10 we coarse chopped, along with 1 jalapeno, and 1 red bell pepper, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup honey, also in this batch we used 6 TBL corn starch and 3/4 cup water instead of the flour and water. The rest of the ingredients are the same as the recipe (by half of course, since we were making 1/2 batches) We like the smoothness and lightness that the corn starch gave the recipe and the coarse chopped peppers give it a pretty look.",

It was my first time so I did cut the recipe in half and used 16 banana peppers with 4 jalapeno leaving in some of the ribs for heat. I also used 2 cups of white sugar with 1/2 cup brown. Instead of just dumping in the flour/water mixture I tempered it a little with the boiling mustard and it worked just fine. My yield was only 4 and about a quarter pints but for the first attempt (and definitely not the last) I was very pleased! Thanks so much for the recipe - I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",

As recommended by another reviewer I added a couple red mini bell peppers which gave the mustard just a bit of color (with no effect on flavor). I bought the inexpensive store brand of mustard which made this even more affordable. Made half a recipe used 4-oz canning jars and ended up with a lot of nice little homemade gifts. This will be a nice change from the traditional jams and preserves that we all give away so often. This should be absolutely delicious with one of the soft pretzel recipes on AR. UPDATE 4.12.12 Mixed this into some sour cream and served over freshly-steamed asparagus last night and it was delicious. Also mixed some of the mustard into mayonnaise for a really nice potato salad dressing.",
