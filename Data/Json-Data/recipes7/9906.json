I didn't have any sesame oil on hand so I blended some sesame seeds in olive oil and used that. I also added some ground mustard. Another reviewer mentioned that it separated quite a bit. Mustard is an emulsifier so it keeps the oil and vinegar from separating and doesn't change the flavour too much.",
