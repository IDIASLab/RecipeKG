I really enjoyed the subtle mocha which wasn't strong enough to bother coffee-hating relatives. My marshmallow idea actually turned out great because the cake wasn't over-sweet. I do think I'd use two 8\" pans next time or put foil over my 9 x13 because the edges cooked faster than the center. Part of that is my glass pan which is pretty but not ideal for cakes but it seemed like the wet batter exacerbated the problem. I will definitely make this again.",

                "reviewBody": "The best chocolate cake I\u2019ve ever had.  However, one other reviewer pointed out a very important fact about baking with cocoa powder.  It\u2019s very important to know whether or not your cocoa powder is \u201cDutch processed\u201d or not.  It will say it in fine print somewhere on the container.  Dutch processed = processed with alkali (typically, sodium bicarbonate!) so if your recipe calls for both baking powder AND soda (like this one does) simply replace the 2 tsps of soda with  baking powder = 3 tsps for this recipe) and you\u2019ll have no problems with how this cake rises or its texture/density.\nAlso, I did not use an electric mixer to combine the ingredients as i was concerned with overworking the batter, overstimulating the glutens.  I mixed it by hand using a rubber spatula until everything was fully incorporated and smooth and poured it into a parchment paper lined 13 x 9 x2 \u201c pan.  35 - 40 mins later, it rose perfectly even, the texture was rich, yet had air and when it was cool enough slid right out onto a platter which  the parchment paper helped effortlessly facilitate.  GREAT CAKE!!!  My go-to decadent dessert!",
