We don't care for walnuts so I used chopped pecans in it's place. I also soaked my raisins in unsweetened hot chai for 20 minutes before adding them to the muffin batter. (I assumed that black raisins were regular raisins mine were just organic) SUPER moist awesome texture and really flavorful. I got 12 largish muffins out of one recipe--350 for 20 minutes and they were perfect. I think these would be good with chopped apples thrown in and maybe a half teaspoon of nutmeg too. I'll make this again.",
