I'd say add half or 2/3 the sauce, and perhaps another 25% paprika.  Add more carrots as well.  Other than that, quite delicious.  The recipe doesn't say whether to stew uncovered or not, but I tried uncovered and it started to develop a skin on top.  I suggest partly covered to allow it to thicken without a skin.",
