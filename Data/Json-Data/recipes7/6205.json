This was surprisingly delicious! I used two peppers one red and one green and I think I used a little more salsa than called for but those were the only changes I made to the recipe. I did find that I needed to simmer it just a little longer than called for (I let it go for about 15 minutes) but this could just be due to the size of the chunks of pepper and chicken I was cooking. And do not forget the cheese it really makes the dish!! Can't wait to make this again!",
