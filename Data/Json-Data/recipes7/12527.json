I highly recommend that you mix the lemon zest with the sugar first, stirring it together with a fork so the lemon oils get fully incorporated into the sugar. This makes a more even lemon flavor throughout the cake as well as dispersing the zest more evenly. I like to let the zest and sugar hang out while the butter is softening. I only used one cup of sugar and it worked out perfectly for me. I used an 8 inch square cake pan and checked the cake after 35 minutes and it was fully done (it could have been ready earlier then that so I would check on it around 30 minutes next time). I also would not skip out on the lemon syrup, this dense cake would be very dry without it! I dusted the cake with powdered sugar to make it a little prettier and cover up the holes from the syrup. This is great served with some blueberry sauce and dollop of whip cream!",

I used some Meyer lemons that were gifted to me, and I followed the recipe as written with three exceptions:  I figured that one lemon produces about 1/4 cup of juice, so I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice for the syrup--but I didn't bother to heat the syrup.  I baked it for 42 minutes at which time the cake seemed to be done.  I sifted the flour and baking powder but not with the lemon zest (added that afterwards) because you can't get zest through a sifter!  I like the idea of adding the zest to the flour mixture because it coats it so that it mixes evenly throughout the batter.  My family will love this cake!  Thanks, Christina!",

I also reduced sugar to 1 cup.  Cake is dense, but I found the lemon sugar sauce moistened the cake quite a bit. I liked it best with whipped cream, as it added a light note and more moisture. Wanted a big piece, but it's dense so my ti mmy said NO.  Easy to put together. The batter is thick, but no biggie, used back of soup spoon to spread it in pan, which worked well. Will make agsin. I could see a nice blueberry or raspberry sauce on this being a nice addition.",
