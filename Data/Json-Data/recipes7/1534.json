You should replace the lemon lime soda with strawberry daiquiri mix and I would definitely add more fresh strawberries in the recipe.

You may also want a few more ice cubes to get a daiquiri like consistency.  Also, this does not make a very large serving, so you may want to double all ingredients.",

I'm preggers & this was EXACTLY what I was craving.  1/4 c. of sugar makes it way too sweet, so just use 1/8 c. sugar & add more if you need to.  5 strawberries makes it more fruity.  I went easy on the lemon juice too, more can be added at the end if needed.  YAY for a recipe that makes 1 drink!  I've been craving fruit so much and will probably go through my carton of strawberries just making these every night.  Big plans for adding other fruits to it too!",
