There's just something about these pillowy puffs of sugary deliciousness that turns them into a gourmet treat. And talk about delicious! Try these next time you make smores, add one to your cup of hot cocoa, or include some in your holiday cookie tins. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.",
