(And I doubled the recipe!) I took the advice of another reviewer and served these on slices of my favorite baguette, drizzled lightly with olive oil, topped with the Titaina and then toasted briefly under the broiler. The only adjustment I made to the topping was to add a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar, which I think really brought out the complex flavors of such a simple dish. I used a large can of albacore tuna and  fire roasted tomatoes from my local organic grocer. Still, no one could believe that anything came from a can...not to mention that I put cinnamon on tuna :)Thank you, thank you, thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "this is very good with a few tweaks. Kept all proportions the same but used jarred roasted red peppers 1 jalapeno for a bit of zip fresh chopped cilantro and garnished w/some oil-cured black olives. I couldn't see the sense in cooking this for as long as stated unless it is supposed to be the consistency of a chili sauce maybe? Never having this before and no posted pic I didn't know if that was what the consistency was supposed to be but preferred it less 'mushy'. Added the drained tomatoes after sauteeing the veggies and added the spices; threw in the tuna and cilantro at the very end. When I tasted this the cinnamon was very apparent and did not meld well with the tuna. It needed some citrus for the sake of the tuna. I didn't have any fresh lemons to garnish with so added 3 packages of True Lemon(dried real lemon that no kitchen should be without) This drastically improved the flavor! the tuna stood out and it subdued the cinnamon and added no sour taste only the taste of lemon zest. I would only prefer this hot if it was going to be served over pasta(which would be a great Lenten dish) but instead liked it at room temp to serve w/fresh baked savory bread. thanks for the recipe that can be tweaked to taste. Super quick and easy and can use your imagination for a variety of ways to serve it.",

Visually it wasn't appealing to me and the thought of cinnamon and nutmeg in tuna sort of made me gag:) Am so glad I took the chance. Tweaked recipe a bit by using a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles. Added really nice but not overpowering kick. Chopped up a roma tomato since the Rotel can was only 10 oz. Also squeezed in a wee bit of fresh lemon juice and some balsamic vinegar which another reviewer recommended. Also followed her recommendation to serve on oven toasted baguette slices with olive oil. Also had sea salt crackers but the crunchy bread was the best My husband absolutely loved it. Will definitely make again and again.",

This has a very unique taste and you can't really tell what spices are in it... it just really brings out the flavors of everything. I'm sure it would be fantastic with the pine nuts too! I just ate it with some crackers (next time I'll plan ahead and get GOOD crackers!) and the next day I had it in a mini wheat wrap for lunch. I will definitely be making this often! THANK YOU!",
