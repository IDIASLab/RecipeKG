I steamed quickly in the microwave used light butter splenda brown sugar and slightly reduced the honey. I felt it could use more mint flavor. Perhaps it could be obtained by steaming the carrots with the mint or even putting the mint in with the butter to infuse and make more of a \"mint butter\" prior to adding the carrots and remainder of ingredients?",

You didn't specify which type of brown sugar to use so I went with light brown sugar; next time I make this I'm going to try dark brown sugar to see if it imparts that deeper natural feeling that it can convey.",
