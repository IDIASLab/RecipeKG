I put the container in the fridge, about an hour prior to serving, and I think I should have put it on the counter.  When I ran it through the blender, it had the consistency of a smoothie, and we had to have spoons, lol!  It needed a bit more thaw time than I gave it.  I used a cup of sugar in a quadrupled recipe, and I moistened the glasses with an orange slice and rimmed the glasses with sparkling sugar.  Very festive, and everyone enjoyed this cool concoction on a very hot summer evening.  Thanks for the recipe!",

The recipe printed there was slightly different and I've typed it below:\n\n1.5 cups sweet red wine, Zinfandel, or red blend\n1.5 - 2 cups ice cubes\n1 orange, juiced (about 1/3 cup)\n1/3 cup frozen blueberries\n1/3 cup frozen raspberries\n1/3 cup frozen strawberries\n1/4 cup orange liqueur\n2 Tbsp sugar, or more to taste\nFresh berries (optional)\n\nFollowed the magazine recipe exactly using Rosatello Rose wine. Used a bit more ice until the right slushy consistency.  This was so light and refreshing and looked so pretty.  Definitely will make this again and I see this being a summertime tradition.  This is one of those recipes that can be easily adapted to what you have on hand.",
