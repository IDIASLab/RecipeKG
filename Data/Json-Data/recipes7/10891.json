We don't love crusts in my house so I made this with just the bottom crust using \"No Roll Pie Crust I.\" Ifollowed the pie filling instructions closely. Easy. I would give it a 4 and thought it could maybe use some spice... cinnamon? nutmeg? My husband states it is his favorite berry pie he has ever had so I'll give it a 5. Went out today to pick the rest of the berries and will be making this pie again. Thanks shortcutie!",
