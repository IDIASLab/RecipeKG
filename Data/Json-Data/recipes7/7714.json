The individual servings made a deeper custard than what would have been in the round pan called for in the recipe. The custard set to a jello consistency, which is how we like it, in about 50 minutes, and it tasted perfectly wonderful-just like the custard my Grandma used to make. I did use the suggested five eggs rather than four.",
