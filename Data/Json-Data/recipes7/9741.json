Not sure why a big deal was made of the boiling of peas. Two minutes seemed to work well. Isn't that the time the original poster suggested??? It does depend on what type of peas you are cooking as well. Early sweet peas cook faster that the larger variety. Two minutes was perfect for me. Loved it and will continue to use this. Thank you for sharing...very lovely crispy crunchy and thoroughly enjoyable.",
