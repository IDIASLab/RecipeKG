Probably didn't use as much red coloring as I could have but the color has no bearing on the taste anyway.\nInitially I wasn't going to do the frosting but was intrigued by the technique of 'cooking' the milk with flour (had never done a frosting with flour in it). However, I made it with half cream cheese and half butter instead of shortening. It came a bit soft because the only cream cheese I had was fat-free... but it was delicious.",

I had to add some powder sugar to the frosting to stiffen it up a bit and left off the nuts. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is how it is supposed to be.",
