The recipe calls for loaf pans, but I have never made it that way. I have used it twice now for a 4-tiered round cake (I use a pound cake when making a fondant-covered cake as a sturdier cake is required for stability). One batch makes 2 x 6\u201d cakes; bake for 40 min. I haven\u2019t tested it for other pan sizes. For high altitude and personal preference, I make the following adjustments to recipe:\r\n\u2022\tOmit ground almonds\r\n\u2022\tAdd \u00bd tsp baking powder\r\n\u2022\tSub buttermilk for milk\r\n\u2022\tChop strawberries rather than quarter\r\n\u2022\tAdd 4 drops red food coloring",

I'm not sure why some reviewers thought it was too sweet - I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness.  I forgot to buy the almonds so I left that ingredient out and jut put in a little more strawberry, but I didn't feel like it was missing anything.  Like the other reviewers said, there is no reason why you can't fit all this in one loaf pan.  It took about 10 extra minutes for it to cook that way.  Overall this recipe was very easy, and I would certainly make this again.",
