This is one of THE best desserts I\u2019ve made in recent memory.  Granted, I really lucked out with beautiful, perfectly ripe, juicy and blemish-free peaches and the importance of that must be underscored.  But the best peach in the world wouldn\u2019t help a bad recipe.  This one is absolutely beyond any criticism.  None.  Zip.  Loved the sweet peaches just as is \u2013 no cinnamon or other spices, no thickening agents, no butter, vanilla (as it seems so many are often wont to add) or anything else extraneous.  Just pure sweet peach flavor.  As for the cake-like topping,  mmm, good.  Buttery, moist and tender cake which could not have been a better partner for those sweet, juicy peaches.  I added a handful of dried cherries to the peaches and I sprinkled the top with sanding sugar before baking.  While both were nice additions, neither was necessary, nor was the dessert necessarily any better for those additions.   The baking directions were helpful and the time and temperature spot on accurate.  Pansy Petals, you indicated this recipe has been in your family for generations and it is completely understandable why.  Thanks for sharing your family\u2019s special recipe - it\u2019s a jewel.",

Besides that, I sprinkled a small amount of sugar on the top to add a tad more sweetness. I would add a little more peaches, as my recipe turned out more bread-y than fruity. However, my family and I thought it was very good and this recipe was a hit for dessert. Also tastes delicious with a dollop of ice cream on top.",

Never had a problem with under baking.  Just touch the top, if it springs back it's done!\nIf you use someone else's recipe and make all sorts of changes on your own and don't like it, well it's not the original recipe and you should not review it as such.\nThis is perfect and a real keeper for my family...thank you\nUse a 9 X 13 pan for perfect results",

Sure enough when the crust was broken to dish it up the center revealed a raw gooey semi-liquid mess. I regularly check the calibration on my oven's temperature so that wasn't the problem. The edges were crispy due to the added bake time and the flavor was decent. Recipe was followed exactly and measurements were triple checked.
