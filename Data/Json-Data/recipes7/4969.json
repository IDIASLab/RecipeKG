It took making lots of coffee cakes and muffins over many years to know what I like in a recipe for them - namely butter buttermilk (or sour cream) a little cinnamon and a perfect crumb topping. Tossing in a little fruit that you want to use before it goes to waste doesn't hurt either! If you don't like nutmeg leave it out. Or substitute with cinnamon or lemon zest. Don't want a coffee cake? This is easily converted to muffins. Today I sprinkled some powdered sugar over the cooled cake (still using the crumb topping) but just a simple glaze of powdered sugar and a little milk drizzled over the crumb topping after it's cooled is pretty too and adds just a little more sweetness. Also fresh or frozen berries may be used!",

I didn't add any of the fruit as I wanted a classic crumb cake and boy did I find one! Just as the submitter states, it's just as delicous without the fruit. The crumb topping is wonderful and next time I'll double it, because it was so good.  The cake itself was moist, slightly sweet, and nicely spiced. I topped it with a nice dose of powdered sugar and it was perfect with a cup of tea or coffee. I can't wait to try this again with a variety of fruits such as apple or blueberry and maybe throw in some nuts like walnuts or pecans....",

The buttermilk makes this especially moist and tasty, I think, and the slight hint of nutmeg adds another dimension of flavor. While I can see making this with lots of different fruits as possibilities, or even plain for that matter, I liked the combination of raspberries and mango. Thanks for the great recipe Naples34102",

I personally did not care for the fresh mango chunks as they got watered down and lost, well, all of their flavor, but I could tell from the blueberries that more substantial fruits are key and will use blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, etc, in the future. I took the finished product to a meeting a few nights ago and everyone raved and are *still* talking about it--esp. the men (go figure...*smile*). The most over-the-top, decadent goodness in this recipe is the crumb topping. It's so divine that I decided to make \"Banana Chip Muffins I\" from this site today and and while several reviewers stated they added cinnamon to the batter, I just couldn't see that in my mind's eye with everything already going on ingredient-wise. Then, I had an \"ah-ha\" moment--incorporate some cinnamon by adding THIS crumb topping! The topping completely salvaged an otherwise ho-hum recipe. I have a little left over that I think will even be good on vanilla ice cream. Kudos to the submitter for a most definite make again recipe many times over!",

The topping was incredible! It made the whole cake just perfect. Thank you Naples for sharing such an AWESOME recipe! UPDATE: I just made this recipe again but this time as muffins. I divided the batter into four bowls. One bowl had the addition of blueberries another had raspberries another I added cranberries and apples were added to the last. I now have a variety of muffins not to mention that some muffins will be a surprise combination. The only problem I see is I want to try them all! They took a little less time to bake so just keep your eye on them until a toothpick comes out clean. Also no need to double the topping. I did and it wasn't necessary. Thanks again Naples!!",

I wish you could have seen my seven-year-old granddaughter bite into this yummy cake! She closed her eyes rolled her bite around as if she had tasted a little bite of heaven and begged for more. Need I ever say anything more?? UPDATE 8/21/10 This freezes very well.

                "reviewBody": "I tried these as muffins using powdered buttermilk a peach and blueberries in place of mango and raspberries. Submitter suggests all but the powder buttermilk as possible variations. I look forward to doing these sometime when I have the pans and all the listed ingredients but even with my substitutions they were tasty. I do wonder if a hotter oven (400 F. perhaps) for 20 to 25 minutes would work if doing muffins. I made two dozen small muffins and cooked at 350 for about thirty minutes.",

                "reviewBody": "I wish I could say I loved this but it was just wrong for me in so many ways. I found out I hate baked mango- the taste texture and color were all unappetizing. As others have mentioned the cake around the fruit was gummy as well. I also did not care for the grit of raspberry seeds in the cake. The cake was fairly bland and too fluffy- every piece served fell to the side. I prefer a coffee cake with more \"body\" to it. And lastly- I really missed the traditional buttery streusel. This was tasteless and the dry sand texture was not what I want in a crumb cake. I would try it with different fruit, some more vanilla or rum extract and a traditional crumb topping but then I guess it would be a whole different recipe. No one cared for this.",
