        "description": "I received this recipe from an old Southern cook, a copy of a copy of a typed-up sheet from long ago, annotated with her notes (which included the word oleo instead of margarine). I've never seen another chocolate cake recipe like it, which instructs the cook to heat part of the cake batter on the stove, and pour the cooked icing over a hot cake. The result is a wonderfully rich (yet surprisingly light) chocolate sheet cake topped with a cooked chocolate and pecan frosting. This cake has an incredible homemade taste, yet is foolproof! Will make you forget Duncan Hines&reg;!",

I did change the recipe, but only to fit my pantry.  Here's what I did.  Instead of 1 cup water, I replaced it with a cup of strong black coffee.  Then I used all butter instead of shortening and margarine.  I melted the butter in the coffee with 3 ounces of bitter chocolate instead of cocoa.  Next for the liquid ingredients, I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  Now for the icing:  I once again replaced the cocoa with 3 ounces of bitter chocolate which I melted with the butter before adding the confectioners sugar.  I cut the confectioners sugar down to 3 cups and used sour cream instead of milk.  Finally, I toasted the pecans and spread them on half of the warm cake.  That way I could offer the non-nut (blasphemy) side to those who do not like nuts.  Then poured the hot icing over all. This cake is too die for!  Or at least to blow your diet for!!!!",
