I was pleasantly surprised that both my husband and I loved it!   The batter is thick, but, velvety which does make it somewhat difficult to spread into a floured pan, so, I probably didn't do it justice trying to layer with the cranberry sauce.  It still tasted wonderful though.   I think that the glaze is supposed to have 1 tsp. and not 1 tbsp. of almond flavoring.   I added about 1/2 tbsp. of flavoring before I realized and it was almost overwhelming.  Luckily I stopped at 1/2 tbsp! I also used butter instead of margarine.   The cake also took about 48 minutes in my oven to cook, but, ovens do vary so just be sure to test yours to be sure it is cooked.   I test mine with a long wooden skewer.   The cake was perfectly moist and the cranberry flavor was a nice touch.  I will definitely make again.",

Since the berries sank,  they stuck to the pan; not their fault.  ;D  Maybe my pan is large - don't think so  - but having two layers of filling for a not-much-higher-than-usual sheet cake doesn't make sense.  They'd be quite close - were quite close  -  together.  I'm thinking for the berries to be filling - in, not almost on - to place the sauce on after putting all the cake batter in the pan.  That way as it bakes, sinks, it'll end up closer to the middle.   I was so surprised that canned cranberry sauce was so good with this.   Almost stunned really.  The cake part reminded me of something - maybe just yellow cake.  Haha.  It was good, but I think I'll try this trick with another recipe.  'Was out of confec sugar so put 1/4t almond extract in 1/4c granulated sugar & stirred.  No liquid.  It looked like snow!  :)  I only sprinkled on a little & it disappeared by day two; the snow, not the cake.",
