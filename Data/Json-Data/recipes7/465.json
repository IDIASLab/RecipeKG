Personally, I am a carnorvoire and have tried variations of this soup and all have been wonderful including the original posting.  Try the following suggestions if you'd like to change it up:  1.)  1/2 vegetable and 1/2 beef broth to replace all vegetable broth.  2.)  Add diced red meat - if using a tougher cut, let it simmer in the broth until tender making sure your liquid doesn't reduce down much before adding the carrots and celery.  The beef imparts a much richer flavor.  3.)  1/2 cup cooked barley is sufficient for this recipe, otherwise the barley soaks up the liquid.  Enjoy!!!",

It seems any veggie would be great in this, as would any bean type--though I would add softer beans late in the cooking so they don't disintegrate.  The barley & spices are what sets it apart from other veggie soups.  Will make again & again! Thanks!",
