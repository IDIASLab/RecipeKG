The filling is delicious. I scorched my first pot of marshmallows by the way; it's best to get the egg whites going and then stand at the stove stirring constantly because those suckers melt fast! I baked the pie for about half an hour at 400 but the crust was getting pretty dark so I reduced the temp to 350 and probably baked it about an hour total. I filled a piping bag with about a third of the meringue spread the rest on the still-warm pie and then piped marshmallowy blobs around the edge. I baked the meringue topping at 350 too for about 15 minutes. Oh I'd also like to try using one egg and two egg yolks in the pie filling because I like it when recipes use up all parts of the egg. I'll make this again with tweaks.",
