Just needs more veggies.\" In other words, wonderful dinner, and one in which chickpeas can certainly stand proudly in pasta's place. I cooked the chicken in 1\" pieces, went a smidge less on the rosemary, added 1/2 med. onion to the garlic saute, and also tossed in a half-bag of frozen (thawed, drained) spinach, and Italian parsley for a bit more color. It definitely has a kick, but it all comes together quite nicely for a marvelous meal. Next go-around (yup, I will gladly make this again), I may, along w/ my inclusions from above, add some diced tomatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms as well, and go lighter on the cayenne & crushed red peppers.",

I followed the recipe to a \"t\" and my 8, 6 & 4 year olds mouths were burning.  So were my husband and I's and we like spicy food.  My bottle says \"crushed red pepper\" and there are a lot of seeds mixed in with the flakes.  I am not sure if it is just my kind of red pepper, but WOW, this was almost not edible because of the heat. THe flavor was good though and I WILL make again as my kids love garbanzo beans, but I will omit the red pepper next time.",

It still had plenty of kick. I will make this again, but I think I will cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces the next time. Thanks for a tasty recipe!",

The flavors are outstanding and the dish certainly lends itself to the addition of more Mediterranean veggies very easily.
