Reduced the sugar to a teaspoon and I used 1 can of coconut milk , omitted the beans as I didn't have any , used 1 large red pepper and 6 shallots for the onions , 1 can of  bamboo shoots and fresh pineapple . Reduced cooking time as well  to maybe 10 minutes total as I used cooked large shrimp. We  love Thai food I cook it often.",
