I did use frozen partially thawed strawberries (since strawberries in MN in the winter don't usually taste so hot) and added a touch more champagne just to get the consistency I wanted. I used strawberry champagne as well. This soup was beautiful impressive and very tasty. You definitely could serve this in a glass as a drink as well but I personally think that just makes this recipe more versatile. The best fruit soup I have ever made.",
