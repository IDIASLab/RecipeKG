                "reviewBody": "**UPDATE** After doing some research, this pie is missing one cup of light cream!! That is why my earlier review was perplexing as I thought it was missing something, here is my earlier review: \"As the name suggests, it is definitely easy to make. I thought it was odd that there was no cream in the mixture but I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out fine, the crust formed a crisp layer on top similar to a macaroon, but the inside was still creamy. It is super duper sweet though, too sweet. I think if there was a 1/2-1 cup of cream in the filling that would have helped with the sweetness. I also used Fresh Peaches,  4 cups of sliced peaches. Some of the fresh peaches were quite tart so I couldn't imagine how much sweeter this would be with canned peaches! I served this with a dollop of sour-cream just to balance out the extra sweetness and it was great, everyone ate theirs and asked for seconds so it was still devoured!! Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least a 1/4 cup and add a 1/2 of sour cream to the filling.\" So, with the inclusion of 1 cup of light cream you might not need to reduce the sugar if you use 4 cups of fresh peaches. I really hopes this helps! :)",

I doubled the cinnamon and added a tsp of nutmeg. Maybe because I used a frozen shell, but after cooking this for 1.15 hours, I removed all the peaches, placed them in a new pie shell, added more fresh peaches and threw out the soupy, watery, sweet doughy mess of a shell. I'm not to upset because I expected it to be bad, as I'm retired and am working on my cooking skills again. But this was a DISASTER.  As I have now learned, I will read the other comments  before I make anything. Most folks cut the sugar in half, which sounds like an excellent  idea as this was extremely sweet as well. Hopefully pulling all those peaches out of the wet sweet mess will allow this new pie to  taste great!",
