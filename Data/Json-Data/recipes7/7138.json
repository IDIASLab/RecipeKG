Used 5 partial bottles of chardonnays I had gathering. Like the fact this recipe calls for only 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of a 1/2 cup like some others. I would say the 1 liter of club soda is a bit too much for my taste. I would recommend reducing it or just adding to taste at the time it's poured.",

I really prefer the more traditional white sangria with brandy (but that's just a personal taste preference). Realized after taking the photo that I forgot to add the pear but I added it later along with a few blueberries. This made it even more of a refreshing summer drink with a fruit salad on the bottom:-) Thanks Monica Joy for a nice summer drink for a BBQ.",
