I made three small changes; I used double-strength coffee instead of water and after I stirred the eggs in, I used extra dark chocolate chips and omitted the nuts only because I'm quite broke right now and cannot afford them. I also noticed that after I got the brownie batter ready, all of it would not have fit in a 9x9 pan. I used a rectangular pan, I think the 9x13. These turned out dense and fudgy and just AWESOME. Hugely loved by my husband (he ate half the pan in twenty minutes!) though I think if he had been my boyfriend, these would have warranted a proposal. Thanks, Debra, for our new brownie recipe! NOTE: To save you scrambled eggs in your batter mixture, make sure you cool your sugar/water/chocolate mixture a bit before beating in your eggs or temper the eggs (add a little of the hot mixture into the egg to warm it slightly) with a bit of the sugar/water/chocolate mixture. Once you cook your egg accidentally, it's all over. Be sure you bake this in a larger pan. Bake it in a smaller pan and you'll end up with less favorable results.",

I ate one and now I feel like a kid who overdid it on the sweet stuff and gave him/herself a tummy-ache.  I love frosted brownies, but wouldn't EVEN consider it on these, even if I eliminated the chocolate chips in the batter! (Allrecipes editors, please seriously consider revising the pan size in this recipe to 13x9 inch.  Previous reviewers who gave that heads up in their reviews to future bakers looking to make these saved them from disappointment. I made HALF the recipe in an 8x8\" pan and could have easily gotten by with a 9x9\" pan as well. The full recipe does NOT work for a 9x9\" pan!)",
