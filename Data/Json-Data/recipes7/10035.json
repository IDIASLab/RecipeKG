I made this recipe and at the last minute remembered the seeds.  I added about a third teaspoon of freshly crushed Caraway seed.  Man, dats some good sauce!

Are you putting in slugs?!\"  After a few minutes of reassurance and promises I was not punkin' anyone in my family all calmed down and trusted their father.

I don't like anchovies: not the look of them, the smell of them, nothing.  I decided to go out on a limb and try this recipe.  I even made it early enough in the day that, if we didn't like it, I would have time to make my old standby before dinner time.  I thought that I would cook the anchovies then remove them from the sauce!  Ha!  Who knew that anchovies \"dissolve\" in the oil!  I continued with the rest of the recipe, using 1/4 tsp of crushed red peppers instead of 1/2 tsp.  OMG.  This was THE best pizza sauce I have ever made!  I hid the anchovy can from my husband so it wouldn't influence his opinion of the sauce.  He agreed the sauce was very good.  We did not taste anchovies, just a depth of flavor.  This ol' Italian girl has a new go-to for pizza sauce!",

                "reviewBody": "I love spicy food, but was definitely surprised at how spicy this pizza sauce was. Maybe it well mellow out once it's on the actual pizza. One important note for you \"scientist\" cooks out there: that 2 to 3 minutes of cooking the fresh oregano might be too long. I would just cook the fresh oregano for maybe half a minute--in reality just until the leaves barely wilted--then add the other ingredients. I ended up with burnt oregano in my sauce. Not sure this recipe is going to stand the test of time for me. It's easy to make, and not bad, but I'm going to keep looking.",
