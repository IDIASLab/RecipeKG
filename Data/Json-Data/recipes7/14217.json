I steeped the blackberries for about half an hour but there was literally NO blackberry flavor was just a nice glass of lemonade. I did cut back on the amount of water for fear the lemon flavor would be too weak and cut back the sugar to my taste preference. After I took the photo I mashed the blackberries which obviously changed the color of the lemonade BUT it also added flavor. Would recommend you do the same. May not be as pretty but it tasted a heck of a lot better.",
