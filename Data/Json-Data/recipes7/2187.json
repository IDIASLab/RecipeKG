I got my breasts moist with olive oil, put the rub on both sides and let it soak in for about an hour or so. Then grilled them up & yum! Even put a little rub on some yukon gold potatoes that I cut up  along with some whole garlic cloves some diced fresh ginger & sweet onions with a little olive oil all wrapped up in foil on the grill.  Made for a very tasty, easy & relatively quick dinner. Thanks for the recipe!",
