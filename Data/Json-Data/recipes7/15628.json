I have never made cobblers with pie dough but this is going to be the beginning of many more. I didn't add any sugar at all the juice from the peaches was plenty sweet enough. I used two 24 ounce jars of canned peaches. One jar was not enough to spread over a 13x9 inch pan. I rolled the dough into a sheet and placed over the top of the peaches. While it baked the juices bubbled up and over parts of the crust and made a wonderful baked on gooey goodness. This was really good I will make this again and again. Great recipe. I have a picture but it won't upload because it isn't big enough:-(",
