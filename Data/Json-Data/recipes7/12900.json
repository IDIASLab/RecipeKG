I didn t have green onions handy so I used dried chives and a teaspoon of onion powder. I adjusted the flavours so I felt I had a nice balance between hot sour sweet and salty (I added a bit of fish sauce for extra salt). Brushed it on chicken thighs and grilled them. The cooking process mellowed the spice a bit and brought out a bit of the sweet. It was fabulous. I will come back to this recipe again!",
