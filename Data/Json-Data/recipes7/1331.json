The pickles and other ingredients should be stirred together in a large bowl refrigerated and stirred every few hours for about a day and then added to the jar after the sugar has dissolved. I know it seems like a large amount of sugar I thought the same when I was first given the recipe but all the sugar should dissolve if you stir every few hours. I see some posting that they changed the recipe and give a lower start rating maybe don't rate the recipe unless you try it as it's written.",

I don't care much for dill so I use sour pickles that I have to buy from Best Maid over the 'net' because they are hard to come by where I live. I do use minced garlic then let them set for a week stirring once a day then again I make a greater volume than this using a 5 lb bag of sugar so it takes some time to get all the sugar desolved. Try chopping some of these pickles into a relish and add to deviled eggs tuna salad chicken salad etc. We love using these pickles every chance we get! Even adds a nice touch to a big ole juicy brat.",
