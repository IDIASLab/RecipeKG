I had never tried the Swanson infused broths before until this recipe. I like to make my dishes from scratch and I make some pretty impressive Thai dishes so to use this broth made me hesitate for a minute. Let me just saw I WAS WRONG! This Thai Ginger Broth is legit. You can taste all of the components in this broth! I tasted the ginger. I tasted the lemongrass lime and soy sauce that is in there. I can tell you right now when I don't have the time to make this from scratch I will most certainly use this broth. I'm so happy with this one I can't wait to try the others! The ramen noodles mixed with broccoli is genius. The sauce that accompanies it is so easy to make and tastes like it took hours to make. Thanks Swanson! I will be making this for years to come.",

First off I didn't use broccoli I had some leftover cooked cauliflower I used. Also did not have the Thai inspired broth called for so after cooking the noodles went ahead and added the beef packed that came with the ramen as well as some fresh grated ginger and some fresh chopped Thai basil. I was just trying to recreate the flavors of Thai. I thought it turned out super yummy! Think this would be over the top yum with red pepper flakes added:) Great recipe!!",
