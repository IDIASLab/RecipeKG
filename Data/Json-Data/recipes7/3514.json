If I get \"a bunch of beets\" from my CSA it weighs around 1.5 pounds with the stalks and ends up around pound after removing stalks. My grocery store has a \"bunch of beets\" that is more like 1/2 pound after removing stalks. What is so hard with just saying something like \"approximately 10 ounces of beets that you put into the pot???? I used a lot less sugar about the called for amounts of allspice 1/2 tablespoon of whole cloves and added around 1/2 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger. It was pretty good but I have no idea if I had the same ratio of the hero of the dish.... beets to spices because I have no idea what the author intended by saying \"a bunch of beets\". After peeling and trimming my beets after cooking removing the tops and peeling I had 14 ounces (400 grams) of cooked and cleaned beets or perhaps 1 1/4 cups of cut up beets. That really wasn't that hard to come up with that but is really useful for my cooking notes for next time I work with this recipe. And this was good enough to work with it again.... I just need to refer to my notes and not this recipe.",
