It has a nice strong cinnamon flavor (which I might lessen that next time, because it was too strong for some), a bright apple flavor (I used McIntosh apples), and it looks beautiful too! I was concerned about the baking pan called for, however. A 10x15 for me is a jelly roll pan, which only has 1\" sides. I only used 2/3 of the cake batter on top of the apples, and that filled the pan. (I was able to put the rest of the cake batter in an 8x8 and baked for 20 minutes for a nice additional cake as well.) So if you have a 10x15\" pan with higher sides than 1\", I would most definitely use it. Even with using only 2/3 of the batter, my cake was perfectly baked in 45 minutes. Thank you for the recipe, this cake was very much enjoyed!",
