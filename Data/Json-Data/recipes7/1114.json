In fact I'm one of those people who think fruit salad should have no dressing at all but I've just changed my mind. The rhubarb is not very sweet and it gives just a hnt of tartness to the fruit.

I was skeptical as to whether or not it really would prevent fruit from browning the taste and the texture of mashed rhubarb. Well it did an excellent job of preventing browning the texture was actually really good and the taste... Well over half of the people I served it to said it was the best fruit salad they had tasted! I cooked the rhubarb according to recipe and poured it over a nice mix of in season fruits. I poured in enough rhubarb sauce to nicely cover the fruit but not enough for it to really collect in the bottom. Then I used the rest of the sauce over waffles the next morning!! Amazing thanks!",

Then add only enough to coat the fruit - maybe a little more if you want more sweet-tart flavor. DONT put in all the sauce or it WILL make your fruit salad soupy! Next - alter the fruits you use for your preference! I always use berries fresh or frozen - strawberries raspberries blueberries and blackberries. I also always use orange & grapefruit cut up (love the subtle flavor the grapefruit adds!) grapes (halved) peach (fresh or frozen) and apple (for crunchiness diced). I don't like bananas personally cause they get mushy too fast. If available I add bing cherries (fresh or frozen) plum and kiwi... with the leftover rhubarb sauce I like to freeze it so I don't have to make it again for the next fruit salad. Note - I put in similar comments before but don't see my prior review - don't know why allrecipes has to delete reviews!",
