My recipe included an extra 1/4 c cornmeal, 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c sugar, and instead of regular milk, I used buttermilk.  They turned out wonderfully moist and very tasty! Next time I will add some fresh corn to the recipe for a little added texture.  This is definitely a must keep in my recipe box!",

I lightened it up a bit by using reduced fat sour cream and Land O Lakes light butter.  I also subbed reduced fat buttermilk for regular milk. This bakes up nice and brown in no time at all.  Perfect accompaniment to chili, pulled pork, or whaterver else you can think of...  The leftovers are great with butter and jam too!",

It's so much healthier then recipes that rely on lots of butter or shortening (and tastes much better because of it). The key is not to overmix when you add the wet and dry. The batter will look super thick...too thick...when you add it to the pan. But it comes out perfect. And no alterations to the recipe to make it a 5 star.",

I made muffins instead of using a baking dish and that was not the best idea because they stuck to the paper liners so I lost a good portion of each muffin.  Next time I will use the 8\" baking dish or try greasing the muffin pan instead of using the paper liners.  The corn bread was moist and flavorful - even a couple of days later! Only change I made was to up the milk to about 1/2 cup because I thought the batter was a bit too thick.  This is now my go-to recipe for corn bread - thanks for sharing!",

I was actually shocked by how dry it was considering that I've found most cornbread recipes even egg-free ones to be generally foolproof. I tried this one because I thought the addition of sour cream sounded intriguing. I also thought that calling it \"sweet\" in the title was very misleading. This corn bread has a touch of sweetness but I'd say you'd need to at least double the sugar to match what most people think of when they hear \"sweet cornbread.\"",
