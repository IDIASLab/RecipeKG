I make blended drinks often and have tried many but there are none in my memory we've enjoyed as much as this one. Interestingly this evoked profound and pleasant memories for Hubs of a drink he's been racking his brain all day to recall. In any case this \"Orangemade\" reminded him of something very delicious he's had before. It is delightfully sweet and citrusy (I cut back on the \"sugar\" to 1 cup) frosty cold and instantly refreshing and thirst-quenching. And the bonus is that since I used Stevia instead of sugar (Splenda is equally as good) it's a low cal no sugar hydrating glass of Vitamin C. Excellent. I wish I would have known in advance just how much we were going to enjoy this - I would have made more than I did.",

I used store bought \"premium\" OJ and fresh squeezed lemon juice. This is a really delicious refreshing drink and I will definately make it again!",

I didn't drink it all the first day so of course when I had the rest the next day it was all melted and just liquid by then.
