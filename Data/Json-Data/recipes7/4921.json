They're amazing.  Made them for my girlfriend's birthday and she's trying to lose weight so I didn't want to sabotage her completely.  Definitely give this a try... I did add a TSP of vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture (we love vanilla around here) and I don't think it would be as good had I not added that, probably a bit bland?  My husband wants me to try doing an espresso brownie next time (with granulated coffee, add to water) so maybe I will!",

The cream cheese part was very difficult to spread it clumped more than anything and the brownie part came out with a VERY wierd chewy rather disgusting texture.

There was definitely enough cheesecake filling to cover the top of the 8x13 pan I used and it turned out exactly like the photo provided. This was very well received by my Hubby and kids and it will definitely be used again. So tasty - so velvety. The one thing I could say to reviewers is maybe it was worth a 30 second shot in the Microwave with your cheese if it was clumpy??? Seriously tasty!",
