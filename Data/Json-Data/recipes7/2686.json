The increased protein (gluten) in bread flour allows for the increased elasticity that yeast creates when rising. If you want your bread dough to rise properly, you must include added gluten- some reviewers added vital wheat gluten, which will also work. I found this bread absolutely delicious and very similar to a loaf my great-grandmother used to make. Definitely making again... and again and again!",

I should also note that I added 1 cup of oats, ground up, rather than 1/2 because the oats just smelled so good I couldn't help myself :P  ...No other changes.  This turned out -AMAZING-.

This bread came out very nice I did make a change to the recipe I added cooked pearled barley to the dough to make little \"barley berries\" in the bread. I left the rolled oats whole not \"blendered\" into flour but I liked these interesting textures in the bread. I made two loaves using 8 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" glass pans. This bread had great texture stayed soft and moist for the few days it took to eat it and held together beautifully when sliced for toasting. It did not rise very high when shaped into loaves which surprised me because it rose very high initially but good enough. It was heavenly sliced warm from the oven with butter and honey. Be sure to knead this dough very well initially to develop the smooth even texture in the final loaf. I did also melt a little butter over the tops of the loaves when first out of the oven to keep them soft. This was delicious! Some in my house who generally only prefer white breads loved this hot from the oven and toasted for breakfast. Enjoy!",

I don't have a candy or insta-read thermometer so I actually used a regular digital read thermometer to make sure the milk was at the right temperature! I didn't add the wheat gluten (as many other people recommended) but I made sure to knead the dough for the whole 8 minutes to break up the gluten already in the wheat flour. For this reason I had NO problems with it rising properly. I ended up making two sub-sized rolls with half of this recipe. It is VERY light and fluffy without being sticky much like what you'd buy in the supermarket! This recipe is a great starting one - you could easily change the type of flour and/or add in other ingredients like sunflower seeds crushed nuts fruits herbs or anything you like! Definitely a keeper!",
