The recipe says to brown the fish before adding the sauce we tried this and the fish would not brown. So we took the fish out of the pan heated up some olive oil and then browned the fish in the oil. I have never had ouzo but we used Ricard--a French anise flavored liqueur. We believe that more could have been used in the sauce. This will definitely be made again and undoubtedly put into a regular rotation in our home.",
