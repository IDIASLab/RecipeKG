The only difference is the sugar is increased to 1/2 cup and use a combination of 3/4 C total of dried cranberries and dried cherries and put 1 or 2 cinnamon sticks in.  My family absolutely loves this recipe and it is a must every Thanksgiving and Christmas!!  Beautiful in a crystal serving bowl.  Keeps well for 4 weeks (I have used it even beyond 4 weeks)",

People saying it is too tart are incorrect or perhaps they substituted. The key is really the cranberry juice concentrate. It is a must in the success of this recipe because it adds a burst of  sweetness. I also diced my orange peel very small and the marmalade I used came with rind in it as well. It made for a delicious cranberry sauce. PS: don't leave out the allspice. I really think it adds a savory dimension to this delicious recipe. Enjoy folks and thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.",

We had a ton of home-grown oranges in the fridge so that was what made sense for us. I just increased the amount of sugar by about 1 1/2 tablespoons to compensate. I also added some orange zest to the pot with the orange juice for extra oomph. I didn't bother mincing the orange peel and just left them in tiny slices. I've used the other cranberry sauce recipe with just OJ cranberries and sugar for many years now but wanted to change things up. I also wanted to find a recipe with slightly less sugar since my family likes their sauce very tart. It tasted much more refined and elegant and was delicious to boot!",

I used clementine tangerine juice (because I love tangerine juice!) and honeybell tangerine marmalade. It's the best cranberry sauce I've ever made by far. My husband agrees and he loves cranberry sauce. This will be my holiday recipe from now on! Thanks:)",
