Sometime I will try it as the original indicates today just didn't have enough time. Here's what I did: 1/4 cup soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup 1/4 cup white sugar instead of 1/2 cup 11/2 tb red wine instead of Asian plum wine (I didn't have any!) Instead of marinating the beef I browned it in a non-stick frying pan and tossed it into my slow-cooker. I added the marinating ingredients to the hot frying pan and let it come to a boil to collect the drippings from the beef let's face it it's yummy even though also naughty! Then with everything in the slow-cooker turned it on low for 6 hours and it was nice.",

The sauce was super tasty! I kept sampling it prior to adding the ribs. I didn't have time to marinade well so I put it all in my cast iron dutch oven and put it in the oven at 250 for about 2 hours. The meat was falling off the bone super tender! I wish I had the grill ready I bet it would have been even yummier to finish it off on a hot grill to carmelize it a bit and burn off a teensy bit of the oil. Definitely a keeper! I never knew I could make Korean ribs! I was sure I was going to regret opening the bottle of plum wine a friend gave me... but no regrets at all!",

I didn't use the Korean style ribs but rather used the American full bone short ribs. I think using the American version doesn't allow for as short cooking time on the grill. Mine came out a bit tough (reason for a 4 star) therefore I placed them in the oven for a couple of hours at low temp approximately 300-325 degrees for 2 hours w/ marinade in a tightly covered casserole dish. They came out NICE. If baking with marinade definately use half of the black pepper. If grilling you can follow the amount of pepper as recipe states. Will make again following the oven low temp oven method instead. Next time I will bake at 250 for even better tenderness.",

Some of us liked a bit of dipping sauce on the side (a mixture of hoisin sauce and hot taco sauce worked well). But I thought they were great served plain. Very easy...if you can wait a day. I didn't have plum wine---so substituted sweet white wine. I cut the sugar in half....and added maybe a 1/3 teaspoon of curry powder (an idea I stole of another beef rib recipe). I would have like a tad more heat (maybe a teaspoon of cayenne in the marinade) but my family thought the black pepperiness was just fine. I cooked them on a medium hot grill with the cover down (about 6 minutes per side). Some burned so I'll need to pay closer attention next time.",
