I also put the zest and sugar into a food processor to grind up the zest (I peeled it first). The only thing I would do differently next time is put everything into my VitaMix right before putting it into the ice cream maker... that would reduce the bits of lemon zest more than the food processor. But the proportion of ingredients is perfect!",

I made it exactly as stated except I put it in my ice cream maker after the freeze/stir process; then I put the mixture in an airtight container and let freeze completely. It's wonderfully creamy tart sweet and refreshing. This is definately a keeper. I can't wait to try orange! Thanks for sharing ECULVER!",

Took much longer to freeze so I continued to stir every hour for about 9 hours until a thick slush then allowed to freeze overnight. Could have been from my substitutions or maybe because I used a deep rather than shallow pan. Tasted great in the morning and not too hard. Thanks for the recipe!",
