I made some subs and this was still perfect.  I used half sugar/half xylitol, Cup4Cup (gluten free) instead of regular flour, plain unsweetened almond milk + white vinegar for the buttermilk, and melted coconut oil instead of veg oil.  Oh yeah, and I added half a cup of shredded cheese, too.  I will absolutely make this again.  I used an 8\"x8\" pan and cooked for about 50 minutes and it was huge, fluffy, and held together so nicely.  One of the best cornbreads I've ever had, even up against \"normal\" breads.  \n\nI have a bread recipe now!  And it tastes like real cornbread!  I'm so excited!  My Texas-raised dad will actually get some bread with dinner when he's over!  I might stay in the will!  I will no longer be shunned!  Thank you Lori!",
