The reason being - the amount of topping is ridiculous basically two full cups for a little 9 square coffee cake. I made the cake portion as written subbing buttermilk for the milk because I had some to use up. For the topping I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar (not white) 1/4 cup flour 1/2 t. cinnamon 3 T. butter and the full 1/2 cup of coconut. I didn t have toasted coconut but regular worked just fine. I also used a 9 springform pan which worked well. My result was delicious and I would make this again. Next time I may up the coconut a little more to 3/4 cup just to compare. Give this a try but adjust the amount of topping and you will be very pleased.",
