You do need to tend to the stove for 30 minutes for stirring, but it is definitely worth the effort. I used regular milk (not cream) and it was absolutely heavenly and creamy!

Low slow cooking adding the broth ladle by ladle allows the beautiful Arborio rice to release all its starches and get all lovely and creamy. The wine Parmesan truffle oil and butter make this rich and intoxicatingly aromatic and decadently delicious. Not a grain of it was left.",

The aroma coming from the pan as it's cooking is irresistible but going the \"low and slow\" route really pays off with this one. My only change for next time would be cutting the truffle oil in half I thought it was too strong and would've preferred to taste all the ingredients equally. Thanks so much for sharing every time I make this it's met with rave reviews!",
