Used Cider Vinegar and omitted other vinegars forgot the garlic and only used fresh dehydrated Oregano and Italian Parsley from my garden. I know it's dumb to review a recipe you fully changed but I just needed this recipe as a base to let me know it was ok to make bean salad with no other veggies. So I combined the cider vinegar parts of other recipes with the simpleness of this one. Thanks Bob!",
