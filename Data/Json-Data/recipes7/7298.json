I had to piece together some of the better parts just to take the photo.  When I first took them out of the oven, I thought that it would have to go straight in the trash...but then I took a bite and wow!  Such a good flavor.  I served them up for the kids and they were gone in seconds.  There needs to be a better way to prepare the pudding mix, sugar and butter so that it creates a glaze, rather than a clump of powder.  I will tweak and make again in the future.",

Use another recipe where you roll each piece of bread in butter sugar and pudding. Very disappointing",
