We think it has at least as good an Indian flavor/savor as anything you'll find on most Indian restaurant menus. (Just needs a pinch of salt.) The method for preparing the corn is unique so far as I know and really adds to the dish. The only drawback is that fresh curry leaves aren't readily available and they add noticeably. One word of caution: if a corn kernel becomes detached it becomes a little bomb waiting to fire hot oil all over the place. Cook this outdoors if possible.",
