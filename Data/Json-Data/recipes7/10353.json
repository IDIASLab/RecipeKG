The candy portion reminded me of the maple candies that are made in Vermont. Not what you want for brittle. In hindsight I wish I hadn't thrown it directly in the garbage after it cooled it off. Broken into small pieces and mixed into some softened vanilla ice cream it may have been salvageable even good. I've had lots of success making brittle in the microwave (never failed). I'll continue to use that method in the future. Edit: Ok I've done a little sleuthing on the contributor's page and see she has another recipe for maple pecan brittle that's almost identical with the exception of one critical ingredient the maple syrup. That recipe clearly calls for \"original maple syrup the thick gooey stuff.\" I'm thinking that this would be something like maple flavored Karo syrup not 100% pure maple syrup. I can't help but wonder if using pure maple syrup was the cause of this recipe failing. Proceed with caution if you're thinking about trying this recipe!",

I halved the recipe and used butter instead of margarine (because that's what I had and because that's what I've used in peanut brittle in the past) and it came out perfectly. I used the ice cold water / hard string that cracks method to test when to add the butter and baking soda. Perhaps I could have used a bit less butter but overall I love this will have to keep myself from eating it all in one sitting. The flavor of the pecans is really brought out by cooking them and there is just a delightful hint of maple.",
