I like to change recipes to make them healthier, so for the fat, I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter, about 1/4 cup coconut oil and about 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  For the flour, I used a mixture of white wheat grain, oats and flax that I ground in my VitaMix.  I used brown sugar and baked  in a large bundt cake pan (see photo above).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was the first time I have ever tried prune cake and I was delighted! I will use this one a lot.  It is wonderful with herbal tea.

I replaced the shortening with a small cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1 tblsp of coconut oil. I cut back on the sugar (which I normally do) by about 1/4 cup using a combination of white and brown sugar and used 1 full tsp of vanilla. I also added the optional walnuts plus 1 tblsp of ground flax seed. I topped the muffins with turbinado sugar and walnuts before baking which gave them a nice crunch. The spice amounts are spot-on for a delicious spice cake taste but even better knowing there are prunes in this (but you would never know it)! I just had one with a hot cup of tea and it was excellent! Thanks for a great recipe LauraT!",

Also to stew prunes easily try one of these methods: 1) Put them in a pan cover with water and simmer on low for 20-ish minutes or until they look plump. 2) Put them in a container cover them with water and leave them in the fridge overnight. You can also add a touch of lemon juice to either method.",
