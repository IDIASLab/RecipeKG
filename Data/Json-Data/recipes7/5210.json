        "description": "This recipe came from my high school cooking class. Over the years I have tweaked it and retweaked it so many times that I have changed it to a mincemeat cake with either pecans or walnuts. It tastes similar to fruitcake, but without the candied fruit. When the kids ask me to make a fruitcake, this is the one they are referring to. At different times I have added coconut, candied fruitcake fruit, and chopped dried fruit. It has a bit of a fruitcake flavor. If you add extra ingredients and it causes the batter to be too moist, more flour can be added. Up to 1/2 cup flour can be added without changing other ingredients. If you add more flour than that, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder.",
