Instead of making it a \"lasagna,\" I put the squash in the bottom, then the ricotta mix, then the meat, then the mozzarella and parm on top. The family loved it. My 4 year old didn't want to eat the big pumpkin pieces, and I am sure he would have preferred the seasoned lasagna-style flat pieces of squash. I will definitely put this on the regular winter meal rotation.",

I had 3 servings, and got full without the carbs of the noodles. \nhusband: said he missed the carbs from the noodles, and wanted carbs after dinner. He said without noodles there was too much meat sauce.
