I made half the rice recipe with 4 breasts and they fit fine in my large size pot. The chicken turned out very bland. The breasts should be seasoned. At the end, I shredded the chicken and mixed everything together. I didn't use carrots because I am allergic, had I put them in this would have been even blander (and mushier). Also, the long grain and wild rice boxes have less than 1 cup mix so prepare to buy several to get the amount needed. The dish in general is NOT visually attractive. If you are looking to WOW guests, don't choose this one. I suppose it would be good to feed a large group of people but only fixing the flavor. I will mix in some light cream and Parmesan cheese to make it look like a risotto.",

My family was not enthused about this either. I used 2 boxes of wild rice & supplemented w/ 1 cup instant brown rice. I think you could get by w/ 3 boxes of wild rice though. Also I would omit the carrots they don't add anything to the taste. I think this would taste better made w/ plain rice.",

The only changes I made: used 2 large turkey breasts rather than the chicken breasts, and used vegetable broth instead of plain water.  Still, my 6qt crock pot was full to the brim.  I was hopeful as it cooked, but ended up disappointed in many ways.  The turkey was tender and tasted fine, actually did have a seasoned taste.  However, the overall dish did not look appetizing and was certainly not satisfying.... and my family loves both rice and carrots.  The rice was just rather strange tasting and the bottom was overcooked, some of it burnt.  The carrots seemed out of place, adding nothing to the dish.  In hindsight, I'd prefer to cook the meat in the crock pot and prepare the rice and carrots separately.  I think all would turn out better that way and look vastly more appealing.",
