The 3rd time I mistakenly dumped a container of applesauce in before realizing I forgot the eggs, and it still turned out great!

When it went into her lunch she said that it was so very crumbly that it was hard to eat. She was also surprised that it had applesauce in it because she didn't taste that at all. She was hoping I could come up with a way to make it stick together more. Any suggestions would be helpful! Thanks Margaret N!",

I never had baked oatmeal before and wanted to try it first for my family before making it for others- liked the idea that this would be more like a bar or cake than sloppy/gummy oatmeal. Good texture and flavor though I would have liked it to be a bit more bar/cake like- took longer than stated to cook but that could be pan size. Will definitely try this at work for a 4H group this week! Update- this has become one of our favorite go-to recipes for camp breakfasts! I love the added protein of the milk (sometimes even sub yogurt) and the applesauce in place of oils/fats. I make it in full sheet pans and the texture is great- holds together well- still best eaten with a fork but can be picked up by hand as well.",

I don't see the value in taking the time to bake it (and adding unhealthy ingredients like eggs sugar and butter) over just cooking it on the stove and adding some milk and honey. I think I will try it again with strawberries and some almonds (to give it a crunch because it was too soft for my taste). My son liked it though.",
