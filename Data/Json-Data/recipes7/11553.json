But this one was creamy and perfect. I made 1/4 of the recipe and the secret to keeping it from being to wet is the part of the recipe about salting and peppering the cukes and letting them sit in the frig to lose some of their natural liquid then further drying them with paper towels. They turned out perfect and the dressing was neither runny nor too much. It was perfect.",

However even with the salting step and with cutting the dressing down it got very watery... I guess this may be the nature of working with cucumbers though since they contain so much water. All in all this is a good recipe due to the wonderful flavors!",
