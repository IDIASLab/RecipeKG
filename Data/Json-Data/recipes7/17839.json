Full of flavor, and you leave the peach skin on so it's a cinch to make! There are chunks of fruit, so if you want a smoother texture, add a couple more peaches before cooking and strain with a mesh strainer before adding sugar. As with all preserves, a little time consuming, but worth every minute...",
