This is my take on the results of this recipe, prepared exactly as it instructs.  If the directions are followed and the bananas are chopped, a whole different consistency of not only the batter, but also the cake, is achieved.  It is CAKE, not at all like a dense, heavy banana bread texture.  It is much lighter than that, with a soft and tender crumb \u2013 in color and texture it\u2019s similar to a yellow cake, even tho\u2019 the batter is quite thick.  What\u2019s cool about chopping the bananas and folding them in is that you get these delightful pockets of creamy banana in every mouthful.  I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make this cake again \u2013 on its own, with the chopped banana, or with any variety of fruits as well.  It is only slightly sweet, but with the frosting it\u2019s just right. The frosting is ALMOST perfect. It\u2019s creamy, fluffy and velvety smooth, with no air pockets despite being beaten at a high speed.  And the use of heavy cream rather than milk, water, or any other liquid aids in achieving all those characteristics. But\u2026the amount of butter is just a little much.  While some butter cream frostings are too sweet, this one is noticeable butter overkill, and I say that even loving a butter cream frosting with lots of it. Reduce the butter to 1/2 cup and this would indeed be perfect.",
