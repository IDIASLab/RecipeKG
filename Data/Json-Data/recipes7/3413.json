So far it seems the sugar will stay on nicely when I jar them.  Others I made a lot of sugar mix was at the bottom of the jar.  I think the honey makes it stick well.  I tried a few with some cinnamon they were super as well.  Will add the cinnamon for the holidays. Recommend!\nUPD: sugar stayed on & didn't end up in the bottom of my jar....a winner!",
