For those of you that use scales; a cup of strawberries is about 5.5 oz,or 152 grams. What I've found works for me. If you are filling a cake, I lay down a very thin, almost transparent layer of buttercream before I add the strawberries. This keeps them from soaking through the layers. Also used a  to prevent them from squishing (that's a technical term lol) out when the next layer is added.",
