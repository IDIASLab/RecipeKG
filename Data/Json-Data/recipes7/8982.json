Didn't have an orange, so I used about 1/4 more of OJ than called for, plus the OJ was 50% reduced sugar .  Didn't miss the zest, and used about 10 packs of Splenda in place of sugar.  The glaze reduced nicely, and the entire family loved it!  I think this is one of the best chicken recipes we have had.",

I had bought Tamarind puree to use in a Pad Thai recipe and wanted another recipe to utilise it more often. I wasn't sure what herbs de provence was I guess we don't have that round here so I looked up what herbs are normally in that mix and saw it included basil and thyme which I did have. I used a tablespoon each and found the thyme a bit strong so I'll adjust the herbs next time. We served with salad but might try on kebabs also. A really great recipe I'm pleased to have!",

I did not have a fresh orange so used good-quality Orange juice and omitted the zest. I also did not have the optional chili garlic sauce. This sauce would also be great on pork. I pounded the chicken breast to 3/4\" thickness then scored both sides and marinated for 45 minutes. After grilling we let the meat rest for about five minutes and then sliced to 1/4\" thickness and topped with part of the sauce serving the remainder of the sauce at the table. Definitely nice enough for guests.I served it with broccoli and white rice and a cucumber tomato onion salad.",
