Because of the \"frosted\" aspect of the cornflakes I cut the sugar down to 2/3 of a cup which helped with the overall sweetness. I threw in about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder (my family members are all chocolate addicts) and it turned out well! I wasn't overly fond of these (I couldn't wrap my taste buds around the corn taste) but they're a great treat for the kids! I made them with sliced almonds too which was a nice variation with the chocolate flavor.",
