My husband would make 20 loaves for St. Patrick's Day to give to friends but he would never give the recipe. When asked for it, he would make the person a loaf and tell them that the recipe was a secret. Now that both he and his mother have passed, I think she would like to share it. I make 4 loaves each year for our church bake sale. They sell for $17.00 each and people come to the early mass just to get one.",

This was so quick and easy to put together and baked up beautifully (the house smelled amazing)! I do not have a 9 inch cast iron skillet, so I used a 9 inch cake pan...worked perfectly.  We couldn't even wait for it to cool completely before cutting into it...absolutely delicious! This will be my go-to Irish soda bread from now on~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

(I tend to \"lose\" recipes and find another when I want to make something again) The only buttermilk I could find was full fat which I have never used.  It was really thick!  I added a bit of whole milk to be able to mix in all the flour.  It was great, and probably would have been good if I had followed the recipe too.",
