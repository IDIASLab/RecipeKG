This isn't a beginner's recipe because you have to be careful not to overheat the frosting and you have to beat it soooo long for it to get thick enough to spread. If you don't beat it long enough it will be gritty. If you cook it too long it will get too thick and be hard to spread. The frosting is temperamental but well worth it. It isn't a rich buttery-looking caramel; it's more creamy and beige-colored. I've been making this cake every Christmas for more than 20 years and I know it's difficult to make--I've had a few instances where the frosting was too runny or thick as a brick! But when I take the time and pay attention to the details it is absolutely fabulous. I hope the other reviews don't dissuade you from giving it a try!",

I don't know if there was maybe a misprint.  5 cups total sugar (and I did us confectioners suger and superfine, as directed)?  It was SUPER-sweet & very heavy.  Once cooled, it was not at all smooth like you'd expect caramel filling to be, but very gritty.  Trying to spread it tore apart the top of the cake.  I actually had to heat it up again so I could pour it over instead.  Not worth making again.",

At first I was a bit apprehensive because of the reviews I read-several people stated they had trouble with it particularly the caramel filling-and since I've never made anything with a caramel filling before I wasn't sure how it would turn out. It DOES take a lot of patience and time but it IS worth it!! What I did was after I transferred the saucepan to the bowl of ice water and used the electric mixer for several minutes I then transferred it into another bowl and placed that bowl in ice water and continued to beat w/the mixer. I kept adding ice cubes to the water and after a bit the filling thickened and was PERFECT. I will make this again!!:)",

She does not like chocolate but love love loves caramel. So after reading some whiney reviews and the original posters remarks I decided to tackle this evil caramel recipe;) I followed the directions to the \"T\" except instead of an ice bowl i filled my kitchen sink....I have a small kitchen it was easier lol......so I was concerned at first because in the ice bath it wasnt setting up.....BE PATIENT!......I took a deep breath because i was happy with the somewhat gooey results it didnt run off the cake so yay.....let me tell you about 10 min of the mixture cooling after the hot hard work i came back to put it in a container a BAM low and behold I have caramel \"margarine\" (that was the consistency) PERFECTION for cake filling!!!!! I put it between the layers of the white chocolate cream cake recipe from this site and it was heaven!!! We had some left over and used it as waffle topping lol!!! I will keep this and use it again and again!!! Thank you for such an amazing recipe and thanks great aunt Lizzie!!!",
