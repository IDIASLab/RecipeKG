A nurse friend had never heard of watermelon pickles and when I told her I was going to make them, she asked her Japanese grandmother if she had ever heard of them. The response was very enthusiastic ... \"I haven't tasted them in decades ... tell June if she will send me a pint, I'll give her a pint of berry jam.\" You have pleased more people than you know.",
