I used fresh savory and sage in addition to thyme and rosemary (use what ever FRESH spices sound good), I omitted the all spice but maybe next time will try, added some fresh squeezed orange peal and all.  I marinated for 5 hours - have gone as much at 48 hours if you start with a frozen bird - 48 hours is great and you will be rewarded.  Remember, the brine has to be kept cold 34-38 degrees, so add ice if need be to maintain temp.",

Before putting in oven i stuffed 1 medium onion, 1 apple and 1 orange to turkey cavity and cooked breast side down. After only 4 hours the turkey fell apart before I could turn it breast side up -- next time  I will turn it over 2 hrs earlier instead -- was DELISH -- loved not having to use broth or cider in brine.",
