To make the fan effect, I've found the easiest way is to scrub and peel (or not peel!) a baking potato, then line up the potato parallel between two wooden spoons and cut them thinly until the knife is stopped by the wooden spoons from cutting through the bottom of the potato.  It's easy and it looks pretty cool.  As for this recipe, it works very well, I'm making it for supper tonight, in fact.  I add fresh or dried rosemary to the olive oil, though, then every 15 minutes I pull them out and give them a stir.  Usually they're done after 45 minutes.",

The size of \u201cchunks\u201d being relative, I cut mine on the smaller side which then required less roasting time. (I also roasted them at a little higher temperature, 425 degrees) As you toss and turn them a time or two, just stick a fork in them and when they\u2019re tender they\u2019re done.  Any variety of seasonings or herbs could be used, even the addition of a little Parmesan, but tonight I prepared these with fresh garlic and chopped fresh rosemary and, for added flavor, used duck fat rather than olive oil.",

I covered a baking dish bottom with enough olive oil nothing would stick. Initially placed fan cut potatoes in lightly oiled dish pieced olive oiled fresh rosemary and sea salt in between every slice a little pepper then poured small amount of olive oil maybe teaspoon per potato. Then turned potatoes upside down uncut bottoms up and baked 30 minutes. Then removed from oven using tongs turned all potatoes sliced side up baked another 30 minutes. About 10 minutes before removing turning the oven light on I could see these would be great. Next time (soon) I ll take a photo.",

Even I can't mess it up.\n\nI've made it about a half dozen times by now with minor variations.  First off, 6 potatoes seemed like a lot to me (I'm only cooking for one here) so I halved everything which worked out nicely because I don't see how you're going to fit 6 sliced potatoes on one baking sheet.  (I only have one).  \n\nI found I liked to cut the potato wedges very thin so they would get crisp.  It's hard for me to do consistently though so I do end up with some that are too thick (IMO), but I just let them cook longer than the ones I cut just right.  And they're still good - I just prefer the thinner crisper ones.\n\nAnother issue I found is an inconsistency in smothering the potato pieces with olive oil and spices.  I always run out so I end up with some really well spiced and oiled potato wedges and a few that hardly have any extra flavoring.  So now I am just taking the recipe as a starting point and adding more olive oil and other stuff as needed.\n\nI've been adding other things as well.  A little garlic, onions and the crumbs from a jar of mixed nuts (almonds. cashews. pecans, brazil nuts, hazel nuts - just the crumbs).\n\nThis is so much better than pre-processed \"snack\" food.",
