Also it said to fold in the flour and that wasn't working so I used my hand mixer to add the flour. If you make this cake don't be discouraged with the batter. It is VERY thin. As I was pouring the batter in the pan I kept thinking this isn't going to work but...I came this far just put it in the oven. Surprise!!  It turned out beautifully and the custard set up and wasn't runny at all. My husband enjoyed a couple pieces with his coffee at work and told me there was somethIng about the cake that made you want to keep coming back for more. I will definitely make this again",
