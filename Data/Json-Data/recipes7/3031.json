He asked for a second one to share with his family, and wanted FRESH peaches in it this time.  After doing some research, I decided to try it.  In order to remove the skin easily from fresh peaches, you need to boil the whole peach for about 30 to 40 SECONDS, then plunge them immediately into a bowl of very cold water.  This allows air to get beneath the skin and it is easier to remove.  Afterwards, I simply chopped them up and added them.   I also changed the \"baking mix\" to white lily self-rising flour, and I took some juice from a can of peaches to add the right amount of peach juice.  He and his family loved it, and are awaiting the next installment --  Thanks!",

This is exactly like mine except mine called for flour and added leavening not baking mix. You can also use pineapple as well. I leave off the cinn-sugar topping...and if fresh peaches are in season use them! Thank you for posting so I didn't lose the trusted recipe!",

I added van. and almond extract and the flavor improved. Also added it to the cheese mixture because I thought that was flat too also added extra peach juice. It tasted really good. I wanted to add amaretto to it instead of the juice but was out. Anyhow it smelled great cooking. I had to refrigerate overnight. Well when it was servered the next day the bottom \"crust\" was chewy and not very good. And I didn't feel there was enough cheese mixture per crust ratio. I was so disappointed with this. Even though some said they liked it some of us didn't. It didn't disappear like my other desserts I've made. I also don't think people should rate it so high when they do so many changes to it because it alters the recipe completely. I'm an expert baker I'm known for my cooking I do it as my job. So it was not due to my lack of skills. But I'm not a fan of this one. Sorry.",
