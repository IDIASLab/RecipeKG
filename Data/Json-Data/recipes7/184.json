Just like we remember from the beach only stronger:) We didn't want to buy special hurricane glasses so one-half recipe fit nicely in a standard wine glass. I'm a 150 lb woman and after 2 wine glasses (1 recipe) I was silly drunk! I had a third wine glass which caused a mild hangover the next morning so I told my husband to stop me at 2 wine glasses next time. This recipe has a fantastic kick:alcohol-taste ratio and for the second batch I enjoyed adding another 1/2 ounce each of the flavored liqueurs to make it even smoother. ATTENTION anyone who hates even the slightest taste of alcohol: this recipe is not for you! Stick to the recipes which have a higher juice:liquor ratio and leave this recipe for the grown-ups!;)",
