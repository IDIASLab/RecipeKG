I followed the recipe exactly and I was worried that the strong flavors might overpower the delicate fresh Alaskan salmon. I grilled the salmon on a hickory plank with no added seasonings adding this sauce to the fish on the plate. We found the sauce to be just right with the bright lime flavor being a nice change from the usual lemon. The two of use used less than half the sauce saving even more calories!",
