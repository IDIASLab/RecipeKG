That said I was still hoping for something in between a pudding and cake or at least extremely moist given the instructions to cook till the top was \"jiggly.\" Not so--this is 100% cake. Cooking time is way off. You only need to microwave it for 1.5-2 minutes; if you did 3.5 minutes you would end up with a dry and tough textured cake. On its own this is a rather bland and unfulfilling cake. To redeem it I topped it with freshly sliced strawberries and some cream and that was very tasty. If you need an instant and dense cake (do not expect anything light or fluffy) to serve as a base for some type of dessert sauce/custard/fruit this will do the job but otherwise I can't recommend this recipe.",
