For the 1/2 cup cracker crumbs used 12 Ritz crackers. The nut topping with sunflower seeds included gives this a nice twist from the norm. While using the specified amount of butter next time might reduce it slightly to say 3 tablespoons. A good choice for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner especially if lots of sweet stuff is already in the planned food choices. Thank you emoon.",
