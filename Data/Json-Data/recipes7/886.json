In fact, my sister and I sampled the potatoes before I added any ingredients (just the boiled potatoes, to which I added salt) and we thought they were delicious. Once I added the rest of the ingredients I regretted it. I would make them again with 2X the liquid, using milk instead of half and half, and not quite so much butter and omit the sugar completely. Gotta give props to the rest of your dinner menu, though. I made the meatloaf and green beans - they were a hit! I think I will adopt the meatloaf recipe as my own. I hate meatloaf (unfortunately I'm the only one in my family) and this one was devoured by everyone including me! The Peach cobbler didn't turn out - but then again, baking has never been my fort\u00e8.",

I did not use any sugar because I am not big on sweet. While boiling I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  I also added a pinch of salt and pinch of ground pepper.  Then when i was mashing  the potatoes i added 2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tsp of the steak seasonings. Then to make it pretty I added a few shakes of parsley.   I made gravy with these and they didn't even need it at all!  If you like your potatoes very flavorful this is the way to go. My picky roommates DEVOURED them.  Thanks for the awesome idea :)  ",
