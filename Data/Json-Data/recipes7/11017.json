Years ago my dad told about his mother and aunts making mayonnaise cakes during the war because it was readily available and eggs and oil were not. I wanted to try it and I finally found a recipe from a company but it called for eggs. I made it per that recipe and it was delicious but I still wanted to see a REAL recipe without all the extras that the mayo was supposed to replace. I will be going home and making this cake over the weekend! Thanks so much! I knew there was someone out there that must have had this great piece of history to share. (Note I give this five stars because I know how good it really is!)",

Since I didn't have any marshmallows I cooked the milk butter & sugar for an extra minute (3 min. total time) & then I added the peanut butter & vanilla & whipped it by hand for a couple minutes. Be careful not to whip too long as it will be too much like fudge! Anyway it came out wonderful. Since my cake was only 8x8 size I only used half of it & put the remainder in a jar & leaving lid off till it cools well. I now have enough for another cake. I am pretty certain I will just need to warm & stir to make spreadable again!! Very tasty & I will make again:)",
