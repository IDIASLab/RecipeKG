I followed some ideas given by Marie C. on the Buzz and used the recipe as a liner for bird nests for Easter. I used a small cookie scoop with the dough leveled off and then free-formed a nest with them. After they cooled I used a recipe for the nests found here on AR and put some of that in a muffin tin placing the nest inside that. Using a knife I pushed up the chow mein noodles to hold around the nest. They came out from the muffin tin easily after refrigeration with a nudge from a table knife. These will be place cards for Easter dinner. Thanks sueb for the yummy recipe!",

Using a lightly greased mini muffin tin and the blunt end of a citrus zester I pressed a small amount of dough into the tins to form a cup. I got 36 liners from the half batch. After they were cooled I gently loosened with a knife and inverted on a sheet of parchment. Making half batch of the following recipe at a time I formed nests around the no-bake liners. I got five chow mein nests out of half a batch. These turned out really cute and the taste of the two recipes combined are perfect.

Barefoot & Chocolate Almond Coconut spread and then folded in Quick Oats. Before I even out in the oats the chocolate mixture got somewhat grainy (yes it was off the heat). The oats just made it all crumbly. Taste is there so I rolled in to balls and might cover with chocolate (candy she'll) to keep it together.",
