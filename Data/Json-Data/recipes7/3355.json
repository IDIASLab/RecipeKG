Then I tried adding different combinations of nuts coconut dried fruits etc. The favorites by far were the ones with chopped pecans flaked coconut and dried cranberries. I also made a batch with white chocolate chips (all I had on hand) coconut and chopped walnuts that were very tasty and another with just coconut and slivered almonds. Everything I made got eaten but we definitely think they're better with a few add-ins of your choice!",

The cookies had a definite bean aftertaste that was very odd. I brought these to work and everyone (jokingly) accused me of bringing pot cookies.:) They weren't bad but just left a really weird aftertaste. Most of the cookies got tossed.

We had to use whole wheat flour instead to I adjust the mesquite flour to 3/4 cup and the flour to 1 1/4 cups to balance out the graininess a bit.
