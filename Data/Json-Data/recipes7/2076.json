PEPPER..needs PEPPER..lots of it..freshly ground black and some cayenne... lemon juice, sumac, olive oil...the spinach must be DRY ( I use frozen chopped and squeeze out ALL of the water once it is defrosted )...and more salt...( the dough sucks out the flavouring so the filling must almost be over flavoured for the end result to have any flavour !!! must taste too spicy, too lemony, too olive oily to oniony before you put in the pockets and you willhave perfect end result fatayer",
