I substituted olive oil for the oil. I felt like this recipe lacked taste - I added grainy mustard to adzing - the red wine vinegar was not strong enough. Also - I added the mushrooms to the pan when the mushrooms were half way cooked - Otherwise the peppers would have cooked mush quicker and have gotten very mushy in pan.",
