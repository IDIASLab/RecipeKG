I used 90% lean beef for the meatballs and doubled the meatballs recipe. When I tried to roll the meatballs, though; I was unable to obtain the right texture. Even though I used half the meatballs in the sauce,  the meatballs took much longer than 30 minutes to cook through. Next time I will make a few changes: less olive oil, ground meat that is not so lean, italian seasoning for meatballs, and oregano for the sauce, and continue to use less sugar. The extra serving of meatballs I baked and saved for appetizers and sandwiches.",
