I actually have started using 5 tea bags as others suggest. (3 regular 2 decaf so no one lies awake at night:) ) I dump the bags in the bottom of a juice jug cover with a few cups of boiling water and let steep until very strong and remove the bags. Then I add the sugar half a can of lemonade concentrate undiluted and here's the part I feel really finishes it a sprig's worth of mint leaves. I stir all this up (the sugar doing some muddling of the mint for me) and then add as much water as the jug will hold. So four stars for the old recipe but for my purposes this new version is the real five-star winner:) Hope you enjoy!",

I decided to used Earl Gray tea instead because I couldn't find any Orange Pekoe at the store. I also followed some over people's suggestions of using 5 tea bags instead of 3. I added the additional sugar but after tasting the final product I probably shouldn't have because it's way too sweet. I had to brew two more cups of tea to try and even out the sweetness. Next time I make this I'll keep the Earl Gray because it smells amazing don't use the extra sugar and brew 5 cups water with 6-7 tea bags to even out the sweetness. I also may not use concentrate next time because it has 29 g of sugar. I may try to use crystal light or some other powder to taste for less calories and less sweetness.",
