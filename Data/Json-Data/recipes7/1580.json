I found that it needed to be baked an additional ten minutes in my oven, so I would monitor the bread carefully the last few minutes of baking time. Next time , I plan to add walnuts or pecans.  I will be making this bread all summer long.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

I made the batter into muffins instead of a loaf and they were fluffy not too dense and had the perfect amount of cinnamon flavor. I made exactly as written except I omitted the flax and arrowroot and I made into about 24 regular sized muffins (which I cooked at 350 for 20 minutes). Thanks!",

It comes out as a moist brownie textured loaf! We did change somethings though. We added about 1/2cup of carob powder to the recipe and removed about 1/4cup of the flour. Also we reduced the amount of sugar added by about 1/3. I think the carob helps with the sweetness anyway. If at all possible add the flax seeds because they just make it all that much more special!",
