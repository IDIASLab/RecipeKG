After pouring into the prepared pan, it is tradition to add objects to the barmbrack which symbolize certain things for the person who receives each in their slice.  Thoroughly clean objects before adding them to the barmbrack.  These objects can be pressed into the bottom of the loaf after baking instead: coin-wealth or good fortune; ring-will marry within the year; bean-poverty; pea-will not marry within the year; matchstick-unhappy marriage; thimble-single for life.",

By the next day it was edible and the whole family enjoyed it. The appearance of the cake looked ok but I think it overcooked. I cooked it right according to the directions and baked it for an hour at the temp it asked for but I think that perhaps for our oven that at that temp it was too much. Since they want another one today (the other is all gone) I will make another and bake for 45 minutes not the whole hour and check it and that may work for us. It was a good cake the only thing is we couldnt eat it day one because it was hard and dry. The apple really changed all that. I have to wonder if the original recipe was for the celsius temp and that maybe when it was converted to farenheit (if it was) that that has something to do with it or if it was just our oven is a bit different. Allowing for these differences I gave it four stars not the highest rating.",
