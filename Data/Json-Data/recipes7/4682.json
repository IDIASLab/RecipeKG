I had read other's reviews which said that the cake took ages to cook and I intended to fill the cake anyway so I decided to bake it in two shallow 9\" pans instead of a 3\" deep. Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. This is NOT a good chocolate cake. The top didn't just crack it created a crisp almost crusty top while the inside was still bordering on gooey. While trying to cut off the top my husband commented that it looked more like brownies. It then struck me that this is an AWESOME brownie recipe. The dense gooey texture of the \"cake\" the rich chocolate flavour and the crisp top is a 5 star brownie. I only wished I'd baked it in square tins as I ended up cutting it into squares. 5 stars as brownies 3 stars as cake.",
