I agree with the submitter that the sugar is necessary in this recipe and the taste of sugar is not detectable. I used freshly ground pepper and kosher salt to season along with a healthy dose of garlic powder. They crisp up very well (due to the addition of sugar). They are best served straight out of the oven when they are most hot and crisp. Thank you mmyers168 for a tasty recipe.",

Be sure not to forget the non-stick spray - I used foil on my pan for easy cleanup and they stuck a bit because I didn't spray it. They were done in about 30 minutes of baking for me.  I only had russets so I used them and they turned out great.  Looking forward to making them with \"teeny tiny potatoes\" cut in half.  And also looking forward to tinkering with seasonings - I can see these tasting really good with some parmesan thrown in, or a cheese garlic dry salad dressing seasoning packet.  Definitely a keeper I'll make again and again.",

I liked the crispness of the fries, and I believe it comes from the sugar, so don't omit that ingredient.  I never use the fryer in the house, so it will be nice to have homemade baked crispy fries during the cold Indiana winters. Thanks mmyers168 for sharing your \"baked\" version of French fries.",

When you place them on the baking sheet be sure you place them in a single layer with space around each fry to aid in getting them crispy. The liquid will cause the potatoes to steam which makes them soggy when baked, so if you remove it first then you get a crispier fry. Also, using a lower in starch potato such as red potatoes or Yukon Golds are a better choice than Idaho for crispier fries. Keep in mind the bake time will vary depending on how thick or thin you cut the potatoes.",

They're super easy and quite tasty. I'm a french fry purist so only used salt to season, along with the oil and sugar.  The flavor is spot-on french fry, no sugar flavor at all. I cut mine into batons and some came out tough on the outside. All of them were creamy on the inside, like a good fry should be. I'll keep playing with the cooking time to get the outside perfect. If I can do that consistently, I'll rate this 5 stars. I served them alongside Crispy Fish Filets (AR recipe). The fish cook so fast that there isn't time to mind another dish at the same time. I really appreciated being able to stick these fries in the oven and set the time. Fish, fries and no stress, it doesn't get much better!",

When frozen, I place them in a freezer bag and when ready to use, I remove as many as I want and bake them at 400F on a foil lined pan sprayed with cooking spray for 10 minutes on each side or until golden.
