This recipe has the foundation for one of my favorite meals of all time. If you are going to use chicken instead of an authentic pork version I highly recommend using all dark meat otherwise sub pork for the chicken and you have a winner. I also use 'Menlo' brand wrappers because true rice paper can be difficult to work with. As for a healthier version -  I'll just shorten my life and stick with the pork and deep fry them because they are that good.",

I also COOKED the pork with some fresh garlic, and let it cool all the way before adding it to my mix. I also used COOKED shrimp. I was doubtful that 5 minutes in some oil would cook the meat all the way through on the inside of the egg roll. \n\nAlso! Use \"Egg Roll Wrappers,\" not \"Rice Paper Wrappers.\" Those are two very different things. \n*Tip: when you're rolling up the egg rolls, be sure they are not touching each other when you set them aside. The dough will stick to the other rolls!",
