So the salsa was pre made and the bell peppers were already chopped.  So it was only a matter of assembly.  It is a great way to use leftovers.  It tastes great with leftover rotisserie chicken, fajita chicken or blackened chicken.  In Texas there is a chain of grocery stores that makes a great mango salsa and also sells a package of pre-chopped three color peppers that can be used as a short-cut.  Either from scratch or using short-cuts the salad is delicious.",

I changed a few things up but kept most ingredients the same. I made the mango salsa as the recipe stated and cooked the chicken breast with citrus pepper seasoning. Instead of the dressing recipe I substituted Newman's Own Light Lime vinaigrette. I still mixed up the chipotle spice mixture but sprinkled a little of it over the top of the salad before pouring on the dressing. Last I used a head of lettuce and mixed that with Salad Savoy for some crunch instead of the spinach & coleslaw mix. I only used red bell peppers instead of all 3 colors (because of the cost). It is a pretty impressive dish to serve!",
