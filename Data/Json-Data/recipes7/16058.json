I was worried the recipe might need to be tweaked. I was expecting it to turn out not great, and after it was done I tried it and I was pleasantly surprised! It's very moist and just the right sweetness to be paired with a homemade icing.  Very almost dark chocolatey taste , almost fudgey in consistency and such an easy throw together recipe I'm sure to use again!",
