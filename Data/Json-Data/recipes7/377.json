It was a bit to sugary for my tastes but kids apperently don't notice those kinds of things and even love the added sugar. This is an amazing recipie to share with younger family and kids and most sugar disliking parents can at least suffer through it. It is somewhat an aquired taste so don't knock it after the first bite. What I have heard suggested most though is a bit less sugar.",

I didn't think it was too sugary. I used it on a plain English muffin and it would be great on plain toast or biscuits. You might want to cut the sugar back if you're using for waffles or something sweeter. I was tempted to add vanilla and/or nutmeg but it smelled great while cooking so I decided to just make it as stated. I wonder if the negative review on here was meant for the other egg jelly recipe on this site as there is no water in this recipe and this recipe is very creamy even before cooking. I cut the recipe by 1/3 and used a whisk instead of an electric mixer. I cooked it in a small non-stick skillet--make sure you keep the heat low and keep stirring. Mine was done at 15 minutes.",
