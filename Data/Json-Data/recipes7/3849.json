I do not have an ice cream maker so I used a shallow glass dish which I place in the freezer and stirred every half hour for the first 2 hours. This procedure worked great. In the fall I will be sure to freeze my own cranberries just for this recipe. This recipe makes for not only a refreshing delicious dessert but a delightful looking one as well. Thank you Larkspur for such a fantastic recipe!",

The ingredients can be a little tricky to find at this time of year. I already had cranberries in my freezer thank goodness. My regular grocery store doesn't carry unsweetened raspberries but I found them at another store. There was only one brand of cherry juice that I could find so that's what I used. Each of the ingredients is well worth working for. I'm amazed and impressed. Thanks for the recipe!!",

I used RW Knudsen Tart Cherry Juice in this recipe and fresh lime juice. This was a little work but totally worth it in the end. I do not have an ice cream maker I actually froze this in a freezer friendly container. After it firmed up I ran it through the blender again and re-froze. Even without an ice cream maker this turned out fantastic. It was a little sweet with the Truvia--what I'd do next time is cut back just a touch. Still we enjoyed it eating it all in one night!",

I strained the pulp as directed but kept a little bit of it in the mixture because I do like having some fruit remnants in a sorbet. I used fresh limes for the juice.

It does have a lot of different ingredients that can be hard to find depending on the season. Luckily I adore cranberries so I always buy some every year when they are on sale and plop them in my freezer. The cherry juice while I only had two options was actually relatively easy to find in my grocer's juice aisle. The only issue I had was in straining out the pulp--I couldn't get it to work so I just pureed everything in my food processor and mixed it all together. I'm sure that's my malfunction though. If you like tart flavors like cranberry lemon or lime (which I do very much!) you'll probably love this. Very easy too! Thanks for the recipe!",
