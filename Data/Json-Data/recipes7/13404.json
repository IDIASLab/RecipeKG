        "description": "This was given to me by my very best friend; it's her mother's recipe, and a wonderful basic biscotti recipe. Very rarely do I make them the same way twice. You can add dried cherries, cranberries, walnuts, toasted almonds, chocolate, white chocolate or cinnamon chips, or nothing at all -- It's good enough to stand on its own. I also change the flavorings and use almond or vanilla extracts. These will keep for a couple of weeks (if you're lucky) in your cookie jar!",
