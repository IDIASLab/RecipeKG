First I cut back on the ginger and garlic by half as I didn't want it to be overpowering - I figured I could always add more if necessary. I didn't have siracha sauce so I used Frank's Hot Sauce. I also added cut up raw chicken to cook with the veggies. I also didn't have ramen noodles so I used broken up rice noodles which I cooked as per the package instructions. Next time I will increase the spices a bit more. I will definitely make again.",

I love the flavor of sesame oil and do not keep peanut butter on hand and so sesame oil it was. I had some mushrooms that needed used and threw them into the mix and they worked nicely. I halved the bok choy because 4 cups seemed like a lot and I have mixed feelings about my decision. It could have used more texture wise but the flavor was there and quite pungent. This would be good with all sorts of different veggies. Snap peas and asparagus are the first to come to mind. This recipe is a keeper and one I will make often. Thanks for sharing!",

                "reviewBody": "My 12 yo daughter adventurously bought bok choy to expand her culinary palate.  We used this recipe and both loved it.  The peanut butter adds a richness to the chicken/veg broth without adding a peanutty flavor to the soup.  We used only one packet of Ramen noodles (all we had on hand) and added them for the last few minutes of the broth's simmering.   I found that was enough noodles for a good soup, but she preferred more, so we'll likely use two next time.  \nI cut back the hot sauce (we used Chohula's) by less than half, and it was perfect for our taste (although our noses were still running!).  I also found the soup rather salty, and I will likely use several cups of water in place of some of the broth next time, or cut back the soy sauce a little? What I do know is that we'll definitely have this one again.  Delish!",
