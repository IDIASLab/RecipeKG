        "description": "This is my mom's Memaw's Pet&reg; Milk Pudding recipe, only done right if cooked on the stove top. I'll always remember her through her recipes more than her pictures. This recipe is great on cold nights, dressed up with cinnamon. A really great comfort food-I've seen and felt it work! I'm Southern and firmly believe in comfort foods. This pudding is great for holidays, but it is also a really special treat my mom would make on really cold nights, or when she was feeling nostalgic about her grandmother. I hope someone tries it and loves it as much as my family does! We pour a lot of heart into it, too. It always has that extra special feeling to it, because we always make it to share with each other.",

I made this for an Allrecipes challenge for recipes without faces (pictures). I specifically went out and bought the PET milk and even bought margarine to follow it exactly. Pudding is one of those things, that slight changes can fail a recipe. So, even though, I had acceptable subtitutes I didn't use them. For the eggs I used 3 medium sized. I don't like a real eggy tasting pudding. I used a good medium sized thick bottom pot and started the boil at 7. I was worried, as that temperature is prone to making pudding burn. However, I whisked it well and it was fine. As soon as it started a slow boil, after about 4 minutes, I turned it down to 3. It was already plenty thick so I just let it simmer, while whisking, for 5 minutes. The cinnamon on top was a nice touch. I don't care much for pudding, but was happy this actually turned out. It did only make about 4 small servings though.",
