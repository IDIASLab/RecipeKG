It is an easy (and I mean EASY), fast, and tasty modification of my boyfriend's grandmother's monkey brain recipe.

Still, I was a bit skeptical about using the canned biscuits because that \"canned biscuit flavor\" usually comes through in anything you make with them. Not so with these! They were outstanding! Neither of the kids like nuts, so we didn't use them. I don't own a bundt pan of any size, so we we split 3 cans of biscuits (each biscuit cut into 6 pieces) between 2 round cake pans. To avoid cleaning burnt-on sugar off the pans, I lined them with foil, buttered the foil, and sprinkled the bottom and sides with cinnamon sugar before proceeding with the recipe. We shared them with company who popped by and not a sound could be heard while we all indulged in buttery, sugary bliss. Thanks for posting this. Love it!",

Next time I'll add 50% more of the brown sugar/butter mixture. Thanks so much for the recipe!",

I put the sugar mixture into a plastic bag and shook the biscuits in them to coat better. Having made them now I wouldn't put the pecans on the bottom b/c they just burnt and didn't stick to the biscuit. When they came out of the oven I wanted to add frosting. I had a container of Betty Crocker Frosting I had bought so I just heated it in the microwave for 15 seconds and drizzled that on top and sprinkled more nuts on top of that. It's great!",

The first time I made this I used Pillsbury's country biscuit dough (2 x 340g packages -about 40g more than the recipe called for - so I left one of the precut biscuits out) and I found it incredibly salty (4 stars). The second time I went with the same amount of Pilsbury FLAKY ROLL dough and it was FANTASTIC. I used 6 aluminum foil mini cake pans with a single layer of dough balls in the bottom and they were perfect. I used the cooking time in this recipe although the instructions on the package of dough said to only cook 11-13 mins - and they did not overcook. The stickiness is my favourite part so I use half again as much butter/brown sugar.",

I did it in one large one and the biscuits didnt want to rise b/c they were weighed down by everything or so it seemed. Also the biscuits wouldnt cook in the middle. The top was about to burn while the insides were gooey still. So i had to turn out the whole thing onto a baking sheet and bake it like that. Well then it was so dry and basically burnt on the outside b/c of all the sugar that it was not very tasty at all. Good thing the ingredients werent expensive.",
