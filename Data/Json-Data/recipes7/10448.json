In a half batch I did increase the baking powder to a full teaspoon and the baking soda to a half teaspoon. I also used a teaspoon of apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon. I did use a good quality apple cider as well. The kids thought these were great--they ate all six pancakes. Thumbs up--this recipe's a keeper.",

I followed this recipe to the letter my review is based on the way it is written and how they turned out without modifications. The batter was very thin so I added a little more flour (the only change) and what I ended up with were pancakes that had no rise at all and were a bit rubbery. These pancakes were not even remotely \"fluffy\". On the positive side it did have a nice subtle apple-cinnamon flavor. This recipe definitely needs more baking soda and baking powder to get a better rise and some additional flour. I won't be making this again instead I think I'll just go back to my tried and true pancake recipe and add some apple pie spice.",
