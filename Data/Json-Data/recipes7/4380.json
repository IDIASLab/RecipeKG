That being said, I've talked with my fully raised Jewish grandmother and more than a few devout Jews who keep kosher and they've all agreed that the casing is all wrong.

I used two fresh garlic cloves, chopped fine and  added them to the onions once they were translucent. I used the sugar to caramelize the onions rather than add it directly to the potato mixture and added some chicken stock for smoother mashed potatoes. Finally, after I rolled the dough I cut it into squares and put a 2-tbsp scoop of the potato into each square and pulled the dough around it so it looked like a beggar's purse. I found this method much easier than cutting the logs into 1-inch pieces. I plan to make these again very soon!",
