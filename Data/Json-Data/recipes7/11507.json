I threw everything into a ziplock bag a couple of days prior to serving with my pulled pork and chicken and it doesn't get any easier than this. I even forgot to massage it for a day but it was still perfect. It isn't much to look at because well it is just purple but the flavor combo is spot on.  The next time I make this I plan on using white cabbage (red cabbage stains everything purple) so that I can add carrots to incorporate more color.  Perfect to top pulled pork and chicken sandwiches and a keeper!",

Instead I added all ingredients (including the oil) and let it set for about 30 min prior to serving. I used a higher quality balsamic vinegar that (I think) made it taste smoother instead of overly tangy. I agree with the other reviewer that this slaw would benefit aesthetically from added color - - perhaps some green onion and shredded carrot. I will also consider adding a little crumbled gorgonzola and/or toasted sesame seeds the next time I make it. It is good \"as is \" though.",
