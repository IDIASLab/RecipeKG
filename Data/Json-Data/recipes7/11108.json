I didn't have applesauce so I used 1c. vegetable shortening. I know I know less healthy but it was that or nothing so.. I also used canned peaches and dried craisins being as it's winter and good luck finding those fresh! It was a little dry probably because of the wheat flour. It looked like bread dough instead of muffin batter so I added the juice from the peaches in 1/4c increments until it was better. Filled silicone cups 3/4 full. Baked at 375 for 35 min (again probably because it was denser with wheat flour) and voila! These were very pretty moist delicious family treats! Thanks!!",
