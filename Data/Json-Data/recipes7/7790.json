I have a lot of cocoa powder at home and didnt plan to spend extra cash and time just to get myself a packet of oreo cookies for my latest dessert project (oreos are quite expensive from where I come from) so I wanted something quick and easy that could replicate an oreo crust (if not 100%, at least 70% of it) by using cocoa powder. And I FOUND IT!  Made a few adjustments though - I used powdered brown sugar and reduced the amount to half and substituted a 1/4 of the cocoa powder with black cocoa powder. The result: 'cookie-ish' dark bittersweet crust which was exactly what I wanted. Loved the texture, loved the taste.  THANK YOU for this great recipe. I most definitely will never ever buy cookies to make crusts again.",

Word of advice if you make one to crumble and do a sloppy job putting it in pan cause you are planning to crumble anyways and it gets cooked at different consistency just go ahead and crumble when cooled and put back in a short time. It turned out great and looks great too! Thank you so much and for all the reviews that talked me into trying! Update: I kept having issues of the pie shell sticking to the pan so I started crumbling it all and really love cooking pudding and mixing the crust crumbled inside and on top and it's very good! Lots of people have loved it! The crust is a very good addition!",

The crust does not have the exact same consistency and texture as a chocolate wafer crust or graham cracker crust. It's not as crumbly. Also the wafer and cracker crusts are more forgiving if you happen to have some spots where the dough is thicker. With this crust thick spots turned into solid cookies that were impossible to cut through. Be careful to press it evenly and thinly in your pie plate or spring form pan. I baked it in a glass pie plate and it stuck to the plate pretty bad. Next time I try it I'm going to butter the pie plate before pressing in the dough. With these couple of things in mind the recipe is a keeper. In a pinch when no chocolate graham crackers or wafers are on hand this crust comes to the rescue.",
