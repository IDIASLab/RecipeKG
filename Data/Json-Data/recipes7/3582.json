You can substitute adzuki beans with mung beans, lotus seeds, chestnuts, mixed nuts, dried fruits, etc. Once cool, these are ready to be served or wrapped as gift. They will be even more moist if you leave them at room temperature for 2 days. For a more authentic shape, press the cakes into a mooncake mold, small cake tins, cookie cutters, even muffins tins after they have been rolled in flour.",

I couldn't find golden syrup locally so I made the dough with a mixture of 1/3 light corn syrup and 2/3 molasses since this is what I had. I also substituted corn starch for the wheat starch in the bean paste. The resulting cakes are delicious. Because of the molasses the color is much darker than authentic Chinese moon cake but the flavor is very good and they are pretty. I will look for golden syrup and try these again but would also make again with these substitutes. Thanks for the recipe!",

I have had adzuki filling before but I've never had mooncake so I knew that however this recipe turned out it would be somewhat of a surprise. After I made the pastry and filling and put them into the refrigerator I watched some YouTube videos on how to make mooncake.... I realized then that this recipe would not be similar to what you would find in the bakery. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and the filling was only slightly sweet. I used a rolling pin and a little flour to roll out the pastry. I used soymilk in place of eggwash. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe but my kids did not care for it. My biggest problem with this recipe is that it makes 4 times more filling than what can possibly fit into the pastry. I do not recommend this recipe for a pastry novice as the pastry is tricky to wrap around the filling balls.",
