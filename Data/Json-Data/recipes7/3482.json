This is as fine a gelato as any I had in Rome as well - it's just stunningly decadently delicious! Silky smooth mildly chocolate and boldly espresso. Unfortunately with just hubs and me it was impractical to make the little tartufos but they sure would make a beautiful presentation for a dinner party - particularly an Italian themed dinner! I did garnish each serving with chopped toasted hazelnuts (we always referred to them as filberts growing up) a cherry and the shaved chocolate. Aside from being sinfully awesomely good this is beautiful too. I made this exactly as the recipe directs and would do so again - KT has the ingredients and proportions of them perfectly accurate. Just a thought...this is so rich and wonderful on its own I think the frozen whipped topping would only be an unneccesary distraction. But if you must for garnish I would give this the real whipped cream it deserves! But only if you must...",

This was my first time ever making any kind of ice cream...the recipe was very easy to follow and came out better than I could ever imagine! I didn't make the balls, or add cherries...just made the gelato. The grated chocolate (I used milk choc) was absolutely perfect! And it has the perfect amount of coffee flavor. I used to buy gelato in the freezer section of our local grocery store and it was about $9 for a little pint...never again! You just saved me alot of money, THANK YOU!!! ***NOTE TO KTPOPPY: I would change the name to something like \"Chocolate Hazelnut Gelato Truffles\" so that people can find it in a search...the only way I found this was by going to the ingredient search, typing in \"hazelnut\" and going through a few pages. It definitely deserves to be found!",

The cuisinart made it too soft to make tartufo so we just put it in cups and topped it with the cherries and chocolate. It was heavenly! If anyone really wants the tartufo then they might have to allow some extra time in the freezer after the gelato is made, depending on how hard their ice cream maker freezes stuff.  The only ad-libs were a few toasted almonds and some heavy cream flavored with almond extract, vanilla extract, and maraschino cherry juice and white sugar whipped up to top it. There was just enough left to make one tartufo the next day, which was easy after the gelato rested in the freezer overnight. I then hid the lone tartufo in the back of the freezer so only I would know of its existence, until I greedily devoured it when no one else was around to beg for a bite. This brings out the worst in me. So FIVE stars for the recipe and only one for me.",

The most amazing part of it is that while it doesn't really get very solid in my cheap-o Cuisinart ice cream maker it doesn't matter. Make it a day ahead and put it in the freezer. Unlike so many other ice cream/yogurt recipes the texture is fantastic right out of the freezer!!! To me that is the most amazing part of this recipe and what separates it from so many others.

When I return to it it's very easy to make several batches with different flavors in the (mine happens to be Cuisinart) electric ice cream maker maker.

Well it really is more of a coffee gelato than a chocolate hazelnut gelato. We will definitely be making it again but will substitute something for the coffee.",
