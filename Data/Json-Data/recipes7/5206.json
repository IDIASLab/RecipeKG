It was very very sticky (I'm at a high altitude of 6 300') so I added about 6 more teaspoons of flour. It sank very slightly in the center but not enough to be considered a catastrophe. I'd have to noodle with the recipe a bit to make it really sing but overall it was a fun and different alternative to the normally over-sweetened selection of brunch cakes and breads.",
