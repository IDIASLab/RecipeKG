This recipe comes from a lovely, now-elderly Japanese woman friend who was a second-generation immigrant and patiently endured internment during WWII as a young girl. The cucumber salad is similar to sunomo in Japanese restaurants, but a bit more assertive. The ingredients are available in the Asian or ethnic foods sections of most metropolitan grocery stores. If you're diabetic, use sugar substitute instead of sugar with the same results. Original recipe called for 1 teaspoon MSG also.",

I add a dimension by tossing the cucumber slices with about 1 Tablespoon of Kosher salt, making sure it is well mixed.  Allow to rest for 10 minutes, then rinse the cucumbers and drain well before adding them to the rice vinegar dressing.  The end result will be sweet, spicy, crunchy cucumbers.  You can also add length-wise sliced wedges of sweet onion to the vinaigrette.",

I used one large English cucumber and because I did not have chili paste I used chili garlic sauce instead.

I then used the sauce as a dressing and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. Delicious! I will definitely be making this again.",
