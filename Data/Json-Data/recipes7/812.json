If you're looking for something cheesy, spicy, or otherwise flavored, you'll have to either use a different recipe or modify this one. (I'm on a crusade to get people to critique a recipe according to its intended purpose!)\n\nI made a couple procedural changes that may help with the final product. First, I always find it helpful to sift the dry ingredients three times in order to fully incorporate them, especially the baking powder (one reason some folks may have trouble with \"tasting\" the baking powder).\n\nSecondly, I did take issue with the two minute kneading. Far too long for biscuits... you'll activate the gluten and wind up with a more bread-like texture. The biscuit standard is twelve turns, but you develop a feel for when the dough is holding together, sometimes you'll need a couple more or less.\n\nFinally, I roll my dough out into a rectangle and cut it into squares with a knife. This saves time, and eliminates the need to re-roll scraps--which will always be less tender than the first rolled.",

One thing I did do was freeze the stick of butter and then grate with a box grater (I saw this on a cooking show).  That way the butter stays nice and cold for a nice tender biscuit.  Plus it mixes much easier with the dry ingredients.  Will definately make this again!",

Put butter in freezer to harden then grate onto the dry ingredients (from another poster) 3.  Use more than 3/4 cup buttermilk.  I use at least 1 cup because it helps the ingredients incorporate better and is easier to knead when its not so dry. 4. After kneading I roll into a rectangle and cut with a pizza cutter into about 12 square biscuits.  5. Please cut squares on pan right next to each other and let rest for at least 15 minutes 6.  I bake on a insulated cookie sheet at 375 with the dough squares right next to one another.   ***Update***** You can actually freeze these biscuits.  I make a double batch.  Roll them out, cut them into squares and lay cut dough on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  Then transfer the semi hardened biscuits in freezer bags and just bake them on an as need basis. ",

I used to use a buttermilk drop biscuit recipe because I hate rolling out the dough and cutting out biscuits, and they always end up tougher in texture than I want. Whoever invented this method of baking buttermilk biscuits is a genius. Pure and simple genius. Minimal kneading (I usually don't do it as long as the recipe states--just until it's all mixed together), pat it into a square, cut the squares and pop it in the oven. They come out tender, flaky, moist, and delicious. Plus, it is SO easy to mix them up and bake them off just before your meal is done--it takes almost no time or effort whatsoever. The best tasting biscuits I have ever had and the easiest, most ingenious recipe I've come across in quite some time. Try these! They are fabulous. So, thank you for posting this recipe!!",

I do that for all of my bread/crust recipes because, this way, it is a lot less time consuming to get the right texture. These taste similar to the Pillsbury packaged \"Country biscuits\" but much, much better for you! We eat these about once a week at my house. \n\n------------------------- \n\nUpdate: (December 2008) Because I make these so often I always keep buttermilk in the fridge, but this time I was out *Gasp*. I substituted homemade using vinegar as suggested by some reviewers... ew. This batch of \"homemade buttermilk\" biscuits were so gross. To get the 5 star flavor its imperative that you use real buttermilk!! No substitutions.  ",
