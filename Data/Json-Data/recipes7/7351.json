Both times, I have followed the recipe exactly (except that the first time I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and it did not make any difference).  I only have 2 notes to add: first, I have found that the pb only needs 30 seconds in microwave to soften enough to spread, and second that I recommend sifting the coco and the powdered sugar that goes into the frosting.  It makes little lumps, which isnt bad with the powdered sugar, but not that nice to have a bitter taste of coco!  These ones are definitely worth the time and effort, and I will make them many times more!",

It didn't set even after I let it sit in he fridge for more than 30 min or even after I put it in the freezer for another 20 min. I love peanut butter and chocolate together but I thought that the recipe was too see with too much peanut butter. If I ever do this recipe again , I'll make sure to make a thin layer of pb (maybe half of what it calls for) and the frosting too. I'll make half of what the frosting calls for too or just look up another chocolate frosting recipe to replace this frosting. The only part I liked about this recipe was the brownie part they came out nice. I topped it with Reese pieces to make it look nice but it came out looking sad since it was kinda watery. :(",
