I always got confused when I was older and read most fudge recipes they had marshmallows in it and were much darker and softer than our family fudge which was harder and sugary. Now it all makes sense we were making Chocolate flavored Scottish tablet! I wonder if Aunt Ruby (lived around 1900) was from Scotland? This is pretty much the same recipe except we added Ghirardelli cocoa powder to the sugar to make it fudge. (we're from San Francisco that's our chocolate!) It made a light brown not dark brown fudge. Not at all traditional tablet but boy oh boy it was good! The recipe got lost over the years but this seems close enough to try it out. Thanks so much!",
