That being said this had more flavor than any rub I've ever tried but the garlic was very dominant. I rubbed a 2 lb pork loin wrapped it and froze it. Perhaps this gave it more flavor than just overnight sitting. We wrapped in foil and grilled indirectly over med. hot coals as is our usual method. It was drier than usual (I realize the loin is drier but it's what I use for pulled/shredded pork) but the flavor was good and it came through to add to the sauce which doesn't usually happen. I will try this again especially the rub.",
