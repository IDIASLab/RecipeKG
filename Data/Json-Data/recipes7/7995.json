Other than that, I kept to the recipe exact. This waffle turned out soft and fluffy with a crisp exterior--a wonderful waffle! NOTE: Keep in mind when you use whole wheat flour or oats in any form that after you mix the batter up, you will have to let the batter sit for 5-10 minutes to get the whole wheat flour/oats soak up some of the liquid. This way, the batter won't be thin and run all over the outside of your waffle iron.",

I used 1 cup white whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup oat flour (just because I didn't feel like making more oat flour & that's what I had on hand). Absolutely delicious! Hopefully, they freeze well bc I plan on freezing a few for a quick breakfast on school mornings...I can just pop them in the toaster oven! Thanks for sharing!",

I added some cinnamon and flax seeds to the batter as well (neither addition was noticeable in terms of taste but it's nice to have the extra flax nutrients and the blood sugar balance effect from the cinnamon added in!). The egg white makes them so fluffy and slightly crisp- it's like a funnel cake without being fried. I could easily put vanilla ice cream on one and eat it for dessert:P.
