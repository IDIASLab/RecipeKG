You couldn't really taste the 'French Toast-ty' thing in it; it was like a lovely chocolate toast. I omitted the baking powder because I was out of it and it turned out very good. However I needed to use 13 slices of bread (store-bought). I needed to use A LOT of oil even with a non-stick pan. HINT: Fry them well till crisp; the texture is like that of a cake-ish bread when they aren't fried really well. I also found they taste better when cooled not steaming hot from the pan; and this is coming from a person who won't come within a mile's radius of remotely cooled toast French or otherwise.",
