Blackened chicken with a chipotle aioli and caramelized onion just complement each other well. These are good mini-sized or meal-sized. It's easy to prep ingredients ahead of time and just cook the chicken when you are ready. For large sandwiches, cut each chicken breast into 2 pieces.",

We used lemon instead of lime juice in the marinade only 1 cup of white wine (per other reviews) and probably marinated it for only 6 hours but it turned out perfectly. We used a blackening seasoning we already had and the chicken was the hit of our dinner party. We had lots of compliments on the aioli though we did substitute ancho chili powder instead of chipotle due to availability. Thank you so much for the great recipe - these fabulous chicken sandwiches will definitely be making it into our regular recipe rotation!",

One cup of white wine would have been plenty for the marinade. I only marinaded about 4 hours and it was still delicious. I'm sure it would be even better if it marinated overnight. The blackened seasoning was salty and spicy. I like a medium level of spiciness and next time I would cut cayenne in half as well as the salt. I served these on small onion rolls with arugula and sliced tomatoes.",

This inspired me for a great sandwich the second time around and it cut the prep time down to practically nothing and my husband liked them even more. I was in a crunch so I skipped the marinade and blackended seasoning and just seasoned the chicken with salt pepper garlic powder and creole seasoning (you don't need much as the mayo is already so flavorful). I replaced the onions with a slaw that added great crunch (bagged cabbage and added oil vinegar lime juice salt pepper and a bit of sugar). I then topped the sandwich with some thick slices of bacon and the mayo as written int the recipe and they were amazing! The mayo is incredible...definitely the star of the show and can make anything delicious!",

After reading through the reviews I reduced the amount of wine to 1/2 cup and I did not use the seasoning but instead used Penzy's 'Northwoods Seasoning'. I did not want these too spicy b/c my little guy was eating these w/ us and I was afraid that the seasoning w/ the aioli would be too much heat for him. I made these into regular sized sandwiches. The family thought this was a nice change form the usual way we have chicken sandwiches and I will be mkaing them again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
