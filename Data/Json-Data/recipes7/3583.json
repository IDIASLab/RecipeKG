We use 2 small cans tomato sauce & 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  Lime juice and a LOT of cilantro suit our tastes.  GREAT in winter when fresh tomatoes are not the best.  If you like the strong vinegar/acid flavor of supermarket jarred salsa, fresh salsa probably is not for you.  Tweak the recipe to suit your tastes-so fun to change it up!",

I'm sure this would have been 5 stars without the changes but it definitely was 5 stars with the changes. Update: I made 4 different salsas and had the husband try each.

I'm willing to concede that we may walk on the wild side a bit though:-) I was hoping this would be comparable to jarred salsa or jarred picante sauce but sadly this recipe as written cannot replace those. The smoky flavor from the chipotles is particularly nice. Thanks for the great jumping off point!",
