Winter's coming and that means sky-high prices for fresh fruit, so this will come in handy for a quick and easy dessert.  I used Heart-Smart Bisquick for the cobbler topping and sprinkled with some Turbinado sugar.  I did cut back on the amount of applesauce that I mixed into the fruit, it just seemed like too much.  This is a good compromise for a fresh-fruit cobbler.",

This was so easy to make--my 2 year-old even \"helped.\" We ate it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I will make this again; however I think it had too much applesauce in the fruit and will cut back to 1 cup next time. Also I think this would be much better with cinnamon applesauce and Turbinado/raw sugar on top instead of granulated. I'm not a huge fan of biscuit topping but this one was soft and slightly spongy not hard like other biscuit toppings.",

Used frozen blueberries and took the advise of other reviewers to reduce the applesauce in the fruit by half. With a spoon I dropped the topping onto the fruit mix and then smoothed it to evenly cover the fruit. A dashing of cinnamon over the topping made a pretty little loaf!

My only issue was that the ratio of filling to topping seems off; we had a lot of dough on top and each serving of biscuit didn't seem to have enough of the delicious fruit. I used frozen organic wild blueberries which I think aren't as sweet and homemade applesauce for the topping. I had no biscuit mix so used the recipe for Homemade Biscuit Mix from this site scaled to 8 servings to get about two cups. I rinsed my canned fruit too otherwise I think it would have been too sweet. Will make again and try less biscuit:)",

Because I didn't have canned I added 2 Tablespoons of sugar to sweeten up some and a small pinch of salt to the filling. I had the cinnamon applesauce so that is what I used for the whole recipe. I didn't have baking mix so I had to make some. I made 4 servings of Allrecipes Homemade Baking Mix recipe with the change servings button. I did sub butter for shortening in that recipe though. When I measured the mix it came to 1 3/4 cup approximately. So I just reduced the applesauce added at that point to 3/4 of a cup. I increased the baked time by about 10 minutes due to using fresh fruit. I baked it in a foil lined square pan and clean-up was easy too. I served it with whipped topping and fresh blueberries. I rated it 3 stars based on the necessary changes and the advice of others. It would need a little sugar cinnamon or other flavors to ones preference.",

I was really interested in the crust and though it did come together easily it was a bit heavy. Five stars for ease of preparation but I have to knock it down a star for the heaviness of the crust.
