I'm sorry this recipe just wasn't for us. I feel terrible being your first reviewer of your recipe and it just wasn't for us. Maybe I could try the syrup with a different pancake recipe and re-review.",

If I was basing my rating on the sauce alone it would have warranted a five star. I will definitely use it again. The pancakes as written in this recipe did not work. The batter was a dough after the addition of 3/4 cups milk. I added an additional cup of milk to get it to the right consistency. They came out alright after that but they were very sweet. I would recommend cutting the sugar in half.",

I cut the sugar it called for in half. Using 1/4 c in the simple syrup and 1/2 c sugar in the batter. I used a lot more milk than what the actually recipe called for. I cannot give an exact measurement because I just added until I got the desired consistency. In addition to the peanut butter I melted down a small handful of chocolate chips. (I'd guess around 1/2 c) The pancakes were wonderful just by themselves. They were thick yet fluffy and delicious!!! The sauce was amazing too!!! My very petite three year old ate 3 pancakes!!!! The only reason I'm giving it four stars and not five is becuase I do feel some alterations are necessary. Thanks for the base to a wonderful recipe! These will be a new favorite in our house!!!",
