I cooked this on LOW for TWO hours, stirring every 20 minutes. It came out absolutely perfect. I plucked out the beef and poured the excess marinade/sauce into a saucepan. I proceeded to bring this to a boil and added some cornstarch slurry to thicken. Served with stir-fried noodles and veg. Very good.",
