I only used 4 pork chops (for me hubby and the two kids) and only made 4 servings of the Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes (according to the directions on the packet). I kept the rest of the recipe ingredients the same. The pork was nice and tender and the mushroom-herb-sherry gravy is delicious! I couldn't help but to pour a little of it over the mashed potatoes. The only thing I would do different next time is add the garlic a little later in the process or add it to flavor the butter/oil then remove it and add it back at the end. Mine got a little too brown during the cooking of the pork chops. Thanks for the recipe Jan!",

I took the suggestion in the review of Kim's Cooking Now and removed my garlic after it was in the butter and oil for a few minutes and then added it back later so it didn't burn. My pork chops were very thick and were not done at the end of the suggested cooking time so I put the chops into a 350 oven until they reached 145 degrees. They were perfectly moist and juicy. I am typically not a fan of instant potatoes but the Idahoan potatoes had very good flavor and I would use them again if I was restricted on time. Thanks for the recipe!",

However the exception to that sentiment is the instant potatoes. No matter what brand they have that \"fake\" flavor. It isn't worth the time savings. There were plenty of potatoes left over and we put them down the garbage disposal. It is the pork chops/mushrooms/sauce that get five stars from me. My husband yum-yummed his way through 3 chops! It was so simple quick and easy yet tastes like you spent hours developing the flavors. This is going in my regular rotation for sure!",
