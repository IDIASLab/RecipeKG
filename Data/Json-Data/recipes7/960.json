The salsa is meant to be served as a condiment to the baked salmon.  It should be refrigerated and allowed to sit out just a few minutes before serving.  Just wanted to clarify for those who are considering trying the dish.  Thanks!",

It is a perfect summer meal not only because it takes advantage of ingredients at their peak, but when it is hot and humid, the last place one wants to be is cooking over a hot stove. Just a few suggestions/minor changes: 1) DON\u2019T cook the salsa with the fish. The coolness of the salsa makes a nice compliment to the warm fish.  2) Do make more of the salsa. It\u2019s good.  3) I add a bit more broth than suggested. The first time I made this recipe, all the broth evaporated and the fish stuck to the bottom of the pan (I also prefer to use vegetable broth, but that is a taste preference.) 4) The lemon pepper isn\u2019t enough; we add more seasonings to give the fish extra flavor. Oregano leaves are a must and \u2013 depending on my mood \u2013 cayenne pepper/red pepper flakes (for a little oomph) or cinnamon (for sweetness). I usually serve this recipe with mashed sweet potatoes (they add some substance to the meal, but still keep it semi-healthy), but asparagus, an avocado salad or Waldorf salad would all be good accompaniments.

I left one piece without the salsa for a picky child, but the juice flavored that one nicely too.  The pineapple and tomato combo was nice and tangy.  I used a little purple onion because I didnt have shallots.  I also realized that I was out of chicken broth so I just poured the salsa all over the fish and baked until flaky.  I let it set a few minutes so the soy/juice thickened some.  Delicious!  My teenage daughter ate two pieces and went on and on about how great it was!",
