I substituted brown sugar for the sugar in the walnut mixture (and used almonds because that's what I had). I also used whole wheat pastry flourr and put the sugar/nut mixture in the middle which made a delicious ooey gooey ribbon in the cake. Then I topped it with a glaze made of powdered sugar milk and a little almond extract. The sour cream is what really makes it awesome. i will absolutely make this again. Thanks!",

I think next time I will bake in an 8 inch square pan and eliminate the extra sugar in the batter as it was a tad too sweet but will add the chopped nuts. Half the sugar in the nuts for the topping. My husband very much enjoyed the flavor of the cake.",
