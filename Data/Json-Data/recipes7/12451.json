A couple of recommendations - melt some of the butter in the baking dish and butter the sides or it will stick. I used thick 'Texas Toast' style bread and that may not have been a good plan. The egg mixture didn't sink into the bread well and the bottom layer didn't get enough egg mixture while the sides were very eggy and stuck to the pan. I would suggest pouring half the egg mixture onto the bottom layer of bread and the rest over the top. The baking time was fine at 35 minutes.",
