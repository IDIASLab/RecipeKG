I know I know that s a lot but with that single modification this cranberry sauce had the perfect balance of sweet and tart to satisfy our personal taste preference. And keep in mind you always can add more but once it's in there it's not coming out. I ve made cranberry sauce with the orange-y flavor before but I must say that I liked the unique flavor that the fresh ginger root brought to this recipe. The instructions don t say what to do with the pecans but I did coarsely chop them. Cranberry sauce is so simple to make that I find it hard to believe that people still buy the canned (although I know some people like it better). Cutting the sugar way back was key to success for us and my review is based on that single change. It was good!",
