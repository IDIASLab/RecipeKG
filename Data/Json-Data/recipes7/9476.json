It's a huge hit wherever I serve it and my friends make me bring it to every get-together! This is a variation of the popular fruit pizza recipe but I use cookies because the portions are smaller, easier for people to handle and faster to prepare. Serve as soon as possible because the strawberry juice tends to run.",
