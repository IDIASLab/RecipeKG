My donut cutter is on the large side so I only got a dozen out of this recipe. I ended up with around 28 \"holes\" as I used a small cookie cutter to portion out the extra dough. I followed this recipe exactly and the dough is a bit sticky at first I considered adding extra flour but after it rose the first time it didn't need it. It rolled out very nicely and was easy to work with. I fried these for two minutes per side at 375 and they were perfect. I coated half in the cinnamon-sugar and made a glaze for the other half. These were really good there's none left!",

I ended up not bringing the oil to temp between batches (though I did bring it to temp to start) chilling the dough for longer than 10 minutes - about 25... and reducing the cook time by about half. The key to frying donuts is to watch for a good color change note how long it took and halve it for the other side. My husband loved them:)",
