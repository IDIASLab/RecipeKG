Though the jackfruit itself is not my favorite fruit but not bad and this was one of my favorite ways to eat it. If you like jackfruit I would say this recipe is definitely worth trying. The fried jackfruit was great I used the batter for about 9 pods and probably could have done another 9 so I would half the batter if I did this again. The chocolate sauce turned out more like chocolate milk than syrup I did substitute 1/2 c of chocolate chips for the chocolate so maybe my fault. I would recommend a medium rather than small sauce pan unless you re watching carefully. I tried it anyway and it still tasted good with the fried jackfruit though I thought Hershey s syrup was better. The fried jackfruit was also good as an ice cream topping. Thanks for the new recipe to try!",
