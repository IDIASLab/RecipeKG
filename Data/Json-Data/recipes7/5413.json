I have never made a strudel before, but the directions were very simple and easy to follow. I waited until my strudel was of room temperature to try it and it tasted heavenly.  I now wish i had made 2 or 3 of them to put in the freezer for a rainy day.  Will make an excellent breakfast treat, or a quick snack when home from work. If you are looking for a very simple strudel recipie, try this one.  I don't think you will be disappointed.   NOTE:  I only used four small apples instead of 6.  I think 6 apples would have been way too many.  Four apples seemed to work perfectly.  Thank you Melody, for a wonderful recipie.",

I used around 3, although a lot of the \"juice\" leaked out and led to a slightly less ideal pastry to apple ratio. Next time, I'll have to be sure to REALLY seal the pastry edges to seal in the filling. Additionally, I didn't have butterscotch chips, but substituted dried cherries, which was delightful.",

Also sprinkled in a little flour when tossing the apple slices so it would thicken the juices.  I used 5 medium sized apples and it was perfect.  Instead of worrying about whether the edges would seal properly, I put all my apples in the center and then foled in the bottom and top edges, slit the side edges into 1\" strips and then was able to interweave them over the top of the apple pile.  Brushed with a beaten egg yolk and then sprinkled on a little sugar to make it sparkle.  It took longer to cook, I cant remember how many times I resent the timer, but just until it was nice and golden brown on top.  It was amazing!!!  Took it to a dinner party and everyone raved about how beautiful it looked and good it tasted.  They couldn't believe I made it.",
