I added an easy 2 tbsp minced to the cooked meat, along with 1/2 tsp of Italian spices.  I enjoyed the fact that they were not coated in sauce, though they were a little dry, IMHO.  I think maybe 1/2 of a tomato juice would easily remedy that....or, add that extra cup of shredded cheese in the 2 cup bag.  I heaped and packed my peppers full--there was more than enough to go around, which made the non pepper liking people very happy.  All in all, this definitely goes in my keeper box, and after 15 years of marriage, and begging on behalf of my hubby to make this...I will concede and say this is the recipe that fits our bill!",

I just add the raw rice and 1/2 tsp. salt to the cooked beef mixture along with the remaining ingredients. I omit the water and cheese out of preference. I then cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for an hour. Tonight I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for the beef and a can of Italian tomatoes for the regular. I added 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning and 1/4 tsp. salt. Again I omitted the water and cheese. I filled the peppers covered the dish with aluminum foil and baked for an hour.

Opted to make a few changes to the basic recipe but kept to the general idea. Used 6 red bell peppers rather than green, ground round beef combined with chopped-up left-over vegi-burgers (about half & half) , 1.5  cup red onion, 1 cup beef stock, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes, white rice left over from a few days ago, 1/2 lb shreaded mozzarella cheese (only marginally past the ex-date) and 1 tea salt, 1 table Italian spice and some left over soy sauce from last week's Chinese take-out. Worked well, they ate it, and I got the frige cleaned out at the same time. (Wife took the left-over one for lunch the next day - and never picked up on the vegi-burger.)",

I made approximately a double portion, because someone had given me five HUGE bell peppers. I added more onions, proportionally speaking, and used garlic salt instead of plain salt. The next time I make these I will likely double the cheese, too. Oh, and I used more Worcestershire, because I love Worcestershire. My changes weren't so much in the ingredients, though, as in the manner of preparation. Owing to health related limitations, I can spend only short amounts of time cooking. So I browned the ground beef one day, cooked the rice two mornings later, and that afternoon put the chopped onions and pepper in the microwave. All the ingredients went into the iron skillet and I let them heat up for about ten minutes, giving some time for the flavours to blend. Then I stuffed the peppers and baked them for 15 minutes longer than suggested, since these stuffed peppers were so big. They turned out so good that I doubt my method of preparation detracted at all from the outcome. I'm going to be making these on a fairly regular basis.",
