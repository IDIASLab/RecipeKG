I followed the recipe pretty closely but was not a real stickler at following measurements. I'm sure I used less sugar and butter than called for with the apples and squash. I probably had more topping than was called for when completed. It was enjoyed by all and I would certainly make again but for now that was the last of my squash until next season. I could also see simply mixing cubed pieces of apple and squash together rather than pureeing the squash on top of the apple slices.",

I also knew it wouldn't be enough spices for here. I usually make my own mix in the fall and put it in a shaker. So my spices were a cinnamon base (sigon cinnamon) nutmeg allspice and a dash of ginger. I added some to the apples as they were cooking and to the Squash and the topping. I felt the red delicious apples were a little hard this year I cooked them well but they were still a tad to crunchy for me I made apple sauce this week with macintosh and they were awesome. I will make this again but I will probably use macintosh or Cortland apples. But the small amount of spices would never have gone over. My little tweaks made it go over really well here. The kids loved it and it's almost gone. I didn't even get a chance to get a picture as soon as I called dinner they rushed it. I made this with Dutch apple sausage (its made here by one of the butchers at the farmers market) and organic Mac and cheese just in case the kids didn't like it.:/ Tonight they ate Squash lol. Tomorrow is Butternut Squash harvest bread.",
