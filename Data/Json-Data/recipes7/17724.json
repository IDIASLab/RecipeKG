I made exactly to the recipe and it made 20 perfect size muffins took 20 min in oven ( was a bit skeptical of the 17 min to begin with ) I agree with the other reviews to add the raisins even tho not such a huge fan of them they added a nice sweet flavor that it needed I also did handful of walnuts. I started out with cutting a muffin in 1/4's just to taste one and ended up eating the whole thing! LOL",
