I only made a few minor changes: I always use whole wheat flour and Smart Balance - I doubled the green tea to 2 T. (I also used the tea from tea bags this first time even though I have matcha - might use that next time to compare) doubled the walnuts chopped VERY finely (I usually leave nuts completely out of recipes but they're perfect here) and added 2 tsp. of vanilla. I think the baking time/temperature is bit off - I would recommend either 350 degrees for 20 minutes or 325 degrees for 25 minutes. And because of the green tea walnuts and whole wheat flour it's a bit hard to tell when they're done by color/browning alone. The muffins are a a little small - for this amount of batter I would normally make 8 or 9 generous muffins. Still overall a GREAT recipe!",
