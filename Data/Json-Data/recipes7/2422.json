I used 10 tsp of meringue powder and 2/3 cups water.  Also, as other suggested.  I only used 1 cup of shortening.  At the end, because I wanted a bit more sweetness, I added 1 cup of powdered sugar.  Although it does take a lot of work for this recipe in my opinion, it is well worth it!!  **UPDATE**  I made this again today and it seemed softer than usual.  I think it was because I put the meringue powder in the bowl before I added the water, so the mixer didn't get all of it when whipping it up.  Poor the water first, then add the powder slowly to incorporate then whip on high.  Also, I wanted chocolate frosting, and added 1 1/4 cup of cocoa WAY TOO MUCH, unless you like a very RICH chocolate frosting.  I will take it to 3/4 cup or 2/3 cup next time.  To try to compensate for the \"softness\" I added another 1/2 cup of shortening, but I could taste some of it. I am hoping the chocolate will hide it a bit.  ",

Except that it wasn't stiff enough so I added a cup of shortening.  That firmed it to the correct consistency.  I then had my husband do a taste test (his birthday cake after all) and the strangest look crossed his face as he asked if there was any sugar in it.  I tasted it myself and sure enough it was bland as anything.  To try and save it I added two more cups of sugar another teaspoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of salt.  This helped dramatically, especially the salt.  I might want to experiment using salted butter if I ever make this again.",

But before you actually use this recipe There are a LOT of tweaks that you might want to consider: (1) This frosting has NO taste (besides a strong aftertaste of butter); I recommend using both Almond AND vanilla extract. (2) 2 2/3 Cup of shortening was waaaay too much in the original recipe (I could tell just by looking at the darn thing) so I cut it down to 1/3 cup and it worked great. (3) Do NOT substitute margarine for butter. TIPS: (1)If you can use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. I started off with a hand mixer but ended up switching to my stand mixer to get the final fluffy finish. (2) Put frosting in a piping bag FIRST then place in the fridge to cool. It started to separate when it got too warm from holding it (like all frostings do).",
