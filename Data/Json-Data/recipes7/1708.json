So I decided to search and see if it was on allrecipes which it is. This recipe is easy! I am having a new years after party at my house and am going to have a lot of guests so I decided to make a this except I didn't bake this in a springform pan but in a muffin pan with liners because slicing a large cheesecake is a lot of work and it ruins the presentation. It came out NICE! This recipe came out for exactly 2 muffin pans all I did was pat down a tablespoon of the crumb mixture onto each muffin liner and a large dab of the cheesecake mixture and now I have a serving of 24 instead of 12! What a fabulous dessert! Can't wait to entertain my guests!",
