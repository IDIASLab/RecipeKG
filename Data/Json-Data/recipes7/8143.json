This cake is much better the day after. It is so very moist. It is even better if you put your slice in the microwave for 10 seconds to just have it warm. My family would disown me if I did not have this cake for holiday get-togethers. Nothing better with a cup of coffee.",

The cake was moist and flavorful but the icing is truly what separates this from all other apple cakes. Almost like German Chocolate cake icing without the pecans and coconut. I followed the directions except I always add a little extra vanilla. Firm Golden delicious apples were used. Highly recommend!",

I made a few changes to the recipe but it still came out wonderful. I did not have pecans so I used cashews-added wonderful flavor. I did not have allspice or cloves so i just added extra cinnamon and nutmeg-came out great. I didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar. I didn't have baking soda so I used powder and it worked out. I used applesauce instead of the oil. I also added maple whiskey to the icing because someone mentioned that the icing was bland and that came out excellent. I also used only white sugar throughout. Cake came out perfect moist flavorful with delectable little apple chunks in every bite even with all my meddling. My husband took some to work and it was all gone in the first half of the day. I will definitely make this again if i have some spare apples laying around.",
