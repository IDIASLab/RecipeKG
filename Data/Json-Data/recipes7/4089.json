                "reviewBody": "Good dish in need of some tweaking I think. First of all this recipe screams for cinnamon. Add it to the whisked milk and egg mixture before pouring over bread. I used about a teaspoon but use the amount that you and your family enjoy. Use whole wheat bread for a better texture flavor and to make it healthier making sure all the bread is saturated in the egg mixture before covering and refrigerating overnight. Add a bit more cinnamon to the sugar you sprinkle on top right before baking. I also double the blueberries in this recipe. It will be mostly bread if you don't. Nothing wrong with that but I adore blueberries and can never have to many of them! The compote should also have double the blueberries but I did cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup. It would be just too cloyingly sweet to me using the full cup. And you can add the blueberries as soon as the sugar and cornstarch dissolve in the water. I like my blueberries cooked into the compote not just warmed up in the sugar water. You will get a much nicer flavor and consistency this way. Also add a teaspoon of lemon juice right before the blueberries - it will really make a nice difference to your compote. Bake approximately 40 minutes. With a few (okay a lot!) of changes this is a stellar dish! This would also work wonderfully with apple or peach slices sauted in some butter and cinnamon in place of the blueberries and compote. Yum!",
