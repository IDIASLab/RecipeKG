I found an apple tree in my backyard; they were similar to gala apples I suppose but they were still tart because they weren't fully ripe. They worked just fine. The apples soak up all the delicious berry goodness. I did use quite a few more blackberries in the sauce than the recipe called for and I am glad I did. Delicious. Made two- both were gone within 3 days. Definitely baking again soon.",

The only thing I did differently is I did NOT pour the sauce over the top crust I poured it over the apples then placed the crust on top. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use less of the sauce mixture because the juice from the apples and black berries make it watery inside the pie. I would also coat the apples and black berries a sugar/flour mixture to help thicken the sauce while it s cooking. I think I d like it a lot more if the juice stayed put in the pie instead of free flowing out of the pie when you slice it. But either way it s a really tasty pie even my 5 year old grand daughter tore it up and loved it!",
