I found the milk quantity to be a little too much - I ended up adding just over a cup of milk and that was plenty. Next time I'll try rolling these out for cut biscuits. VERY good with a little butter and jam. Be careful not to overmix the dough and if you want a browned top you may want to brush the top with a egg/milk/butter wash. I'll definitely keep this in my recipe box!",

I doubled the recipe and removed some dough to make plain ones before I added other ingredients. I added 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheese and 1/2 cup of diced jalapeno peppers (from a jar) and 1 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. I brushed them with a bit of melted butter out of the oven. They are fabulous! I tried them plain without any changes and they are delicious also. I will use this simple but great recipe often. They went very well with the soup we had for dinner.
