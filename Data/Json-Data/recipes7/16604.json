The flavors were great, the crispy texture added by the panko crumbs was really nice. They cooked perfectly with an extra 5 minutes in the oven. My whole family loved these sliders. I'm going to experiment with different types of meat. This just might become our go-to burger recipe. Thanks for sharing!",

So left overs were served without. The flavor was good but not amazing so we served them with a coleslaw on top and without the buns and they were an easy five star then! I recommend these as slow carb option! So good! The coleslaw recipe is on the site and listed as one without mayo. My husbands favorite recipe and so easy to make.",
