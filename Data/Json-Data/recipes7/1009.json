First dont poke any holes in it instead of useing key lime juice I used 2 limes I also added lime zest in place of key lime juice. Key lime juice is very very tart So it becomes easy to over do. I think 1/2 c. key lime juice too much. Try juice from 2 limes plus the zest then juice from 2 limes plus the zest in the iceing That is what will make you want to make this again Karen",

Baked it and was disgusted (sorry \"disappointed\" doesn't convey my feelings) with the results. The \"glaze\" saturated the cake making it appear undercooked and unappealing. I was too mortified to serve it to my guests. Unfortunately the flavor was not good either so into the garbage it went. I was incredulous of the one 5 star review I had seen and I went back to see if any other reviews had been added perhaps helpful hints to improve it. That's when I saw that others have had this problem. With the price of ingredients this was an expensive disaster not to mention a total waste of time and electricity to bake. If anyone is daring enough to try this recipe at least make a true and proper glaze using confectioners sugar that won't saturate the cake. Sorry about the bad review but it's an honest one.",

                "reviewBody": "Yes this recipe definitely has problems as evidenced by the fact that a) it s been ignored b) only 16 people have reviewed it and c) it has a low rating. I ve been eyeing it for some time thinking that one day I wanted to have at it. Today was that day. I think what happens is that just like with top chefs in the interest of being creative we stray from the tried and true chemistry of a recipe to come up with something different that we can call our own. That may be what happened here. I fiddled with this recipe big time but now it works and can be prepared with confidence in my view as opposed to its continuing to be neglected. So 2 c. of fat is too much reduce the shortening to 1/2 cup. Two cups of sugar is not enough up it to 3 cups. Add 1/4 tsp. salt to heighten flavor. Increase the milk to 1 c. and decrease the lime juice to 1/4 cup. Add 1 T. of grated lime zest and if you can get your hands on it 1 tsp. of pure lime extract. (I buy mine online) The ingredients for the glaze are just fine BUT it has to be heated to a boil boiled for about 2 min. then brushed onto the warm cake. I didn t bother to poke holes in the cake it absorbed the buttery sweet lime glaze like a sponge. The bottom line? This cake is incredibly delicious. Moist buttery beautiful and boldly lime. Don t pass this by! I m rating this 4 stars (but it s really 5!) just so that it isn t overlooked even tho as written I d most likely rate it a 1 or 2 star recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe needed obvious (and not so obvious) changes. Don t use a stand mixer to blend batter; crumb will become too dense a reaction of the long-chain gluten (protein) strands in the flour being over mixed. Replace all shortening with approximate quantity of butter. Not sure exactly how much I ended up using but two cups 4 sticks way too much. Add til consistency is cake-like and batter tastes good. (A batter that tastes good bakes into a cake that tastes good!). Whip the egg whites firm and fold into batter. Don t add the glaze until after the cake has cooled completely: Hot cakes are especially porous & glaze will sink in. Also just mix the sugar and lime juice (no butter) together then heat without stirring until it begins to bubble around the edges and can glaze the back of a spoon. Prompted by other reviewer comments I decided to use my simple confectioner s icing instead of glaze. Just one cup confectioner s sugar mixed into 1 TBS lime juice. Fork drip it over the cooled cake in a lattice pattern. For the time-constrained among us there s an easy solution to this recipe. Simply replace part of the water when preparing a yellow cake mix (I like Duncan Hines) with approx. cup concentrated frozen limeade and a few drops of lime extract. Add more or less of both depending on the amount of lime flavor desired (remember- taste the batter!). Let cool and add your sugar/lime juice glaze to the top. Makes an awesomely good quick and inexpensive cake!",

I made it for the birthday party of a dear friend so it was presented to understandingly forgiving company. The texture was dense & sticky and it came out of the pan unwillingly leaving a crumbly woebegon-looking crust. But when everybody tasted it they did not care what it looked like. My mouth is watering just thinking about this cake. I've made it twice both times it was pitiful looking. And both times it was so delicious you could hear the angels sing.
