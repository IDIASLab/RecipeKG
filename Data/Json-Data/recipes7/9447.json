I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the one cup of boiling water poured over the cobbler before putting it in the oven but that created a very nice glaze when it came out of the oven. The batter seemed to be a bit thick to spread over the rhubarb but I did it the best I could and it came out just fine. A lot of reviewers suggest making it in an 8 X 8 pan which would make it thicker but I liked the 'bar like' result of baking it in a 13 X 9 pan. I also liked the fact that it only calls for 3 tablespoons of butter. I would suggest to everyone that they try the recipe just as it is written before making a changes it was definitely a big hit at the potluck dinner I took it to.",

My older relatives used to make different kinds of pies/cobblers/jams when I was growing up with rhubarb and I miss it. An 8 x 8 dish was perfect size for dessert as some others noted for the cobbler. I added a pint of raspberries yum. Thanks for the recipe!",

We are going to have it with french vanilla ice cream after we have our evening meal. So I really do not know what it taste like I will have to come back in an hour or so. Well it is a good thing I made a double batch-----I do have some left over for tomorrow. This is very good I like the sugar topping it shines like glass and has a very nice crunch. My guys all loved it and said \"Save some for us tomorrow\". I am a midnight eater and I know what I will be having hope there is enough for tomorrow. Very good and easy to fix. I love it. I am so thankful that the rhubarb came out of my garden didn't have to pay 4 or 5 a pound for it. Now I can freeze up some with 6/7 cups and be ready to do this in the winter.",
