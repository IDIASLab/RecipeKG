I didn't have fresh fruit so I made these substitutions: 4 cups of defrosted cubed frozen rhubarb that I squeezed the extra liquid out of. Thawed 1lb bag of frozen unsweetened strawberries that I put in a strainer over a bowl to catch the juices and pressed lightly on the berries to extract more liquid. I substituted some of the water for the berry juice. Since I used frozen fruit and it had more moisture content I increased the cornstarch by approx 1 tsp. I substituted some of the sugars for sugar substitute (totally optional but I try to cut back where I can.) I put about 1/3-1/2 of the crumb mixture on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top. It came out awesome. I was glad I put some foil under the pie pan because it bubbled over a bit. It also baked in 45 mins at 350 in my electric oven.",

I made it for 4th of July and put blueberries in the corner and piped in cream cheese icing for stripes to make it a flag. For my cream cheese icing I mixed cream cheese raw honey vanilla extract and cinnamon. It was delicious! I tried to attach a picture; hopefully it worked.",
