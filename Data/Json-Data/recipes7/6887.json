I weighed the dry macaroni to make sure I cooked 6 ounces. The first time I made it I added the dressing while the macaroni was still warm and it soaked up the dressing making the salad too dry. The second time I let the macaroni cool completely and the end result was a much moister salad. DH and I have both thoroughly enjoyed this salad and I will be making it again. I think the peas make the salad. BTW for the peas I just dump the frozen peas in the colander when I start cooking the pasta and then dump the cooked pasta and water on top of the peas. That makes the peas the perfect texture for us. Thanks!",

Macaroni salad is the one item that I make that is my DH \u201cfavorite\u201d thing I make.  That being said, he and my son did enjoy this recipe.  I knew I would enjoy it and really liked the addition of peas in this salad.  My changes were the pasta choice and the addition of diced onion.  I had a bag of beer stein pasta shapes to use up and we like the taste of onion with pasta.  This is a very good recipe and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make it again.  For me, the peas added a lot to this salad.  Thanks Lorilynn for sharing your recipe.  I was excited to see your recipe become our choice for this week\u2019s Recipe Group selection.  I served this with a \u2019Grilled Pastrami and Swiss Sandwich\u2019, a personal recipe from AR.  We had a great dinner!",
