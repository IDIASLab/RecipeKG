I am not a tomato soup fan AT ALL, so I was leary. I tasted it right after I made it, and still wasn't sure, but after letting it sit and blend the flavors, I was so happy!! I just finished making it for the second time, this time, I put everything in my Magic Bullet. Used only 1/2-3/4 cup oil, and about 1/2 the sugar. We actually use it on all salads for a different flavor. So good! Thanks!!",

When it came to adding in the oil I did what Sherri did and started with a half cup of oil and then added it by tablespoon until it got to the consistancy I was looking for. I used this as a dressing for Mexicali Pasta Salad. Both my husband and I thought it was a little too sweet I'd make this again but I would cut back on the sugar by at least half. I was thinking that this would also make an excellent dressing for taco salad.",

I whisked everything up in a bowl and transferred it to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shook it to further emulsify it.  We enjoyed this on Chicken Fiesta Salad, also on this site.  And to use up the remaining half can of tomato soup, I made half a recipe of Tomato Soup Spice Cake, also here on AR.",
