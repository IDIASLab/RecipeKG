I make a salad similar to this so I'd like to give a few tips: 1) Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to crumble the ramen noodles into smaller pieces before opening the packet. 2) There is a fine line between cooking the noodle mixture perfectly and cooking it too long. Stir often and watch it as it browns! 3) Do not put the noodles or dressing on the salad until ready to serve and eat. 4) Cut the recipe down to the number of people you will be serving. Leftovers become soggy and don't taste as good.",

Seriously, I like crunchy, but I found even the small chunks of the ramen noodles just too hard and dry (hubby agreed). I could see adding a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to this salad, as well as some red bell pepper strips to give it a pop of color.  I used half the amount of sugar in the dressing (personal taste preference) and added a little soy sauce to the crunchies (trying to soften a bit).  Really liked the flavor of this salad, just wish the crunchies were a little less \u201ccrunchy,\u201d but that can be taken care of.",

Really fast & easy we had it with grilled chicken and because of the noodles we didn't even have another side & it was a very nice supper. Oh I went 1/2&1/2 balsamic & red wine vinegar just because i love balsamic I'm sure it would be fantastic exactly as written too. That was the only thing that I changed tho.
