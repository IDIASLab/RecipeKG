This recipe was good, but not great. After searching other similar recipes and experimenting, we found it is missing a key ingredient which gives it it's special flavor: garam masala. Near end of cooking we add 1/4 - 1/3 teaspoon of this and it is fantastic. Also, most shahi paneer recipes include a couple tablespoons of cashew paste. You can make this by soaking approx 12 cashews in boiling water, draining, then pounding into a paste. Lastly, for a creamier sauce like in restaurants, increase water or cream/milk by a cup and lightly puree prior to adding paneer. With a couple tweaks, this is a great and easy recipe.",

The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that the spice level here is very very mild. I would at least double the amount of spices used here to give it more of an Indian flavor.

I made some modifications: I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the fresh pureed which I found made it too tomato-y. I added more cream to balance out the thick tomatoes and didn't have to adjust the spice balance. It was perfect. Since I didn't want to eat too much fattening dairy I used chickpeas instead of paneer and it was just as delicious. Will use this recipe again only I will follow the exact directions with the tomatoes! Or...use only half a can of crushed rather than the whole darn thing at once.",

I used diced tomatoes and 1/2 can (about 7 ounces) of tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes (no pureeing) and used 1/2 Half and Half and 1/2 evaporated skim milk instead of the cream to bring down the calories. I also added some potatoes in with the tomatoes because I didn't have that much paneer on hand and it was delicious and a bit heartier. I found it slightly bland so I added about 1/2 tablespoon of Garam Masala to kick it up which immediately did the trick. Really good recipe.",
