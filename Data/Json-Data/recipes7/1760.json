Instead of acorn squash, we used kalabasa (Philippine squash) from my parents' yard.\n\n A fantastic substitute for the squash is sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed). I browned the tofu before I added the coconut milk. Don't worry if the tofu tastes bland, as it will absorb the flavor of the spices and coconut milk, esp. if you eat the leftovers the next day. I've made this with and without tofu, and I prefer it without. Also, I omit butter and sugar.   \n\n**If you don't have shrimp, you can use chicken breast sliced into thin strips (stir-fry style). Saute the chicken with the garlic, onion, and ginger, then add the coconut milk. **",

Used butternut squash for acorn olive oil for butter and omitted shrimp (just didn't have any). Kept the spices the same. Served over brown rice. I appreciated how easy it was how quickly it came together and how adaptable it was for our needs. Would make again!",

Used silken tofu and it was creamy and added protein. (Peel squash with potato peeler as it is too time consuming with a knife.) Thanks for the recipe!",
