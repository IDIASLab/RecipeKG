I ended up needing to bake it for 36 minutes since it was a deeper dish and it turned out just like a regular cake. It was the most amazing thing I've ever baked. It was moist, perfectly sweetened, not too pumpkin-y. It lasted 24 hours. The kids loved it, my husband loved it, my Mom was visiting and sneaked out in the middle of the night to eat the last piece. I followed the directions exactly (except for the pan size) and made the frosting that goes along with it and I promise you will NOT be disappointed with this recipe. I am using jelly roll pans today just to see if it's any different (and will update my post accordingly). But made in a 9x13 baking dish, it was divine.",

I thought the icing tasted like sweetened, whipped butter (I couldn't taste the cream cheese at all) so I tossed 1/3 of the icing in the trash, added another block of cream cheese and 1/2 c. conf. sugar.  After that, it was fantastic!  So for the icing to be \"cream cheesier\", I would recommend the following for the icing:\n1/2 c. butter, softened\n2 8 oz. blocks cream cheese\n2 tsp. vanilla\n2 to 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar\nGetting hungry just talking about these bars...
