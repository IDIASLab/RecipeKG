I have now baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 50 minutes and the raw dough is still cascading over the side of the loaf pan onto the cookie sheet. Please change this!

I made two batches and accidentally mixed the second one too long. It was still good, but not as good as the first batch. Also, I switched the sugars for extra flavor and added a little more vanilla. I also made some oatmeal cinnamon strudel to top them off... I came into the kitchen and my husband said, \"If you're going to give some of these away I suggest you bag and hide them. I've already eaten like seven!\" Definitely a recipe to save, for sure!!",

The flavor is just wonderful--very chocolatey, with the perfect amount of spice from the cinnamon and cardamom, and then there's a nice brightness you get from the blueberries. I took the recipe submitter's advice and used half oil and half applesauce to cut down on the fat a little bit. The zucchini I used was quite large, so I ended up with 3 1/2 cups grated zucchini. I added it all to the batter, and it created no problems. I also had a 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips that I've been wanting to get used up, so I threw those in too--and they made a great addition also. I baked my loaves in two 8 1/2x 4 1/2\" pans, and only baked them at 350  to avoid the outsides getting overdone. They were perfectly baked in 55 minutes. Thank you so much for this recipe, I very much enjoy that I got 2 loaves out of it, and I can't wait to make it again.",
