I baked the crust in a 9 x 13 before hand and added the filling and baked it at the time share. I added the zest of one small lemon to the crust - I wanted to make sure that there was enough sour. Everyone enjoyed it. In the ;9 x 13, it made 12 nice sized bars. I did take the wrapper of the butter and grease the pan, just to ensure no sticking...pieces came out great!",

I did the following: used Coconut Palm Sugar in the crust white sugar in the filling finely shredded coconut (the texture worked fine for my tastes) fresh squeezed lemon juice (what I had) approximately 3 cups of sliced fresh rhubarb and added about 2 T of my own honey to the filling (based on sweetness comments in the reviews). I baked the crust for 25 minutes. I baked the filled crust for 30 minutes at 350 and 15 minutes at 250 with the pan covered with foil. I wasn't sure if the rhubarb was cooked enough and wanted to be tender not crunchy. I can't wait to make it again. I may switch out the lemon juice for pineapple juice and add crushed pineapple. Thank you for a yummy new dessert.",
