I went to cook it in a pot but it just wasn't enough ingredients for one drink to do so. I used the microwave instead and added the first 4 ingredients in a large mug and microwaved for 30 seconds. I then added the milk and flavorings and did an additional 1 minute. I did change it up some to lighten it up a bit. I used 1% milk and a packet of Truvia for the sugar. For the extract I added a drop of peppermint and 2 drops of vanilla extract. I have used extracts enough to know a little goes a long way. It can be added but not removed. I am not a big fan of making flavored cocoa from a packet. However it did sort of taste like a thin mint cookie although even much more so with some Andes mints melting in the bottom of the cup.",
