It was just my husband and me for Thanksgiving, and I wanted it to be special without making a fuss, so I started with turkey breast, onion soup, and cranberry sauce. I make my own onion soup to cut down on sodium, and I added a few things to make it special. See what you think! I recommend using a slow cooker bag to speed up cooking!",
