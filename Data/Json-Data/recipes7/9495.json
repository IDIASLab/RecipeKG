We always use frozen cranberries, but fresh works fine too. Don't ever settle for cranberry salad from a can when you can make something this tasty so easy. I've had many people say they don't like cranberries but love this!",

While I loved that store bought salad it seemed a bit pricey. This was just what I was looking for. I've made this dish many times. I usually make it exactly as written. I've also made it with pecans instead of walnuts and it was just as fabulous. It has become an expected holiday dish in my family. Not only is it delicious but it also looks very festive on my holiday table.",
