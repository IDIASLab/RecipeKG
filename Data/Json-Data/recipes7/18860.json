        "description": "This kind of pressure cooking turns complex weekend-only dishes into everyday fare. For this Instant Pot&reg; recipe, I adapted our recipe for classic Yankee pot roast, using baby carrots and frozen pearl onions to cut down on prep time. Coating the roast with seasoned flour before browning adds flavor and helps thicken the sauce--an important step in a sealed system where water can't evaporate. Spoon the sauce over the beef and vegetables alongside mashed potatoes, buttered egg noodles, or rice.",
