I added a little splash of milk to the last batch of batter to thin it just a bit as it thickens up even more as it is standing.  Using a 1/4 cup measure I got 10 pancakes.  These were really great with the addition of the salt.  Thanks so much for a tasty Sunday breakfast.",

I tweaked the recipe a little to give the pancakes more of a \"pumpkin pie\" flavor. I didn't have any nutmeg on me so I added some pumpkin pie spice in its place. I also added half a tablespoon of vanilla and increased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup. And instead of maple syrup I served the pancakes with powdered sugar and whipped cream. The original recipe is delicious but if you want more \"pumpkin pie\"-ish pancakes try the changes I made above.",
