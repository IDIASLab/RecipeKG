Yellow curry paste can be found at an Asian market. You may have to add a little more or less curry paste, depending on your taste. I included a more moderate amount in this recipe. I suggest serving this over cooked jasmine rice. It has a little bit of heat, so probably do not serve to small children. Enjoy!",

I am so glad I will have this in my recipe file so I will not have to hunt it up in books. The four stars only mean I am about curried out at the moment.",

Modifications: Doubled the sauce portion of the recipe because I enjoy a good amount of sauce with my curry (and the cans of coconut milk typically are 10 oz). Although I doubled the sauce I used only 2 chicken breast halves which were roasted and shredded then added during the last 10 minutes of simmer to absorb flavor; I prefer this texture and there was plenty of chicken some in each bite. In addition added carrots which were cut on the bias (so that they would cook at same rate as potatoes).",

We liked the real **** spicy to our curry, so we added a generous infusion of cayenne pepper. Like many other reviewers, we also doubled the sauce recipe because it is SO good and due to the fact that a lot of it gets soaked in the fresh white rice we serve with it. And since the only coconut milk we find comes in a 13 oz can, why waste something so delicious? We also could not find fresh ginger, but our Walmart had a fresh ginger paste mixture in the produce section, and it smelled wonderful cooking with the chicken and garlic in the beginning. Awesome recipe!",
