I roughly halved ingredients. I did not have chocolate liquor and used brandy instead. I made a small hole in the top and stuffed the souffles with the melted chocolate chips (I added a bit of butter to the chocolate chips and melted it in the microwave to help with consistency). Still fantastic. I watched several YouTube videos on how to make a souffle before attempting this- I would highly recommend doing this.",

The chocolate chips he noted as ''melted (optional)''; I used a bit of intuition that he meant for the drizzle of the raspberry at the bottom of the souffle. If he meant it like that or not I did it anyway and they came out very delicious! Bravo!",

I wonder if this recipe can be made in one large souffle dish and if so what size? Feb.10 Update...thanks for telling the ramekins size David's Chimpy! I also used a little intuition and removed \"of the raspberry\" from your statement about the chocolate chips to understand what you meant. I think you're correct and the melted chocolate chips are to be drizzled in the bottom of the ramekins along with the optional raspberry in each.",
