The cookies are very tender and soft rather than crunchy. Instead of the whole 2 cups, I add 1 3/4.  I have also successfully used craisins when I found out I was out of raisins and it was still very, very good. Still an awesome, 5 star recipe. Grandma definately knows best-and this recipe publisher gets my whole family's thanks for sharing it.  My daughters and I baked these after reading Molly, the American Girl who's father was in WW11, and she had to ration sugar.  Even if your not crazy about molasses-you will find these the very best cookie recipe any grandma or mom could pass down.  It's a hands down winner with all 9 members of my family.",

I was pleasantly surprised. The steel cut oatmeal lent itself to a cookie with a bit more crunch yet still being chewy.",
