        "description": "I like these so much that I make them often. The sriracha scarcely adds any heat at all (mainly flavor), so don't worry about spiciness. For overall crispiness, I usually bake the thighs on a baking rack that's been placed over a foil-lined half-sheet pan. And don't omit the sugar, as it helps the coating adhere to the chicken. By the way, Kellogg's&reg; Corn Flakes&reg; Crumbs are usually sold in supermarkets near the bread crumbs and coating mixes, not in the cereal aisle.",
