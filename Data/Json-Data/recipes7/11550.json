Followed the recipe to the letter, and we were happy with the taste, but there are just a couple things I will do differently in the future.  I will cook the potatoes whole, leaving the skins on, and then cube.  That\u2019s just the way I cook potatoes for potato salad, and I like the texture a little better, just a personal preference.  There\u2019s absolutely no color in the finished potato salad, and I think visually it ends up looking kind of bland...which it isn\u2019t.  I garnished with chopped parsley which I think helped, maybe adding a little chopped celery would be good, but leaving the skins on will add some color, as will some crumbled cooked bacon which is the next thing I definitely will add.  This is a really easy potato salad to make, and it comes together quickly.  While the potatoes are cooking, go ahead and make your dressing, so you\u2019re good to go when the potatoes are cooked.  One other thing to mention, this is good served warm or chilled.  Thanks KFREESE for sharing your family\u2019s long-time recipe.",
