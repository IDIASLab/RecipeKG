Anyway the creamy center was fine I added a little bit more sugar to it and you didn't need 2 packs maybe 1 1/2 would be better. The recipe I think made too much. On the glaze was good but should have aloud the first layer to dry then added a second layer.I used a bundt pan and it worked fine. BTW I don't really think you detect the alcohol flavor unless you are sensitive to alcohol. Happy St. Pat's!",
