Because the filling is warm when you pour it over the wafers/bananas and then it's further heated in the oven, if you double the filling it will be TOO MUCH hot liquid and your wafers and bananas will melt into a mush (I learned the hard way).  As the recipe stands, the bananas still have some bite.  Hope this helps!  Thanks, Laura M.",

One of my dinner guests described it as \"beauty in her mouth.\"  I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 c., which made it sweet but not excessively so.  That is the only adjustment I made, and it was perfect.  I made this in a pyrex pie dish, and it fit perfectly.  The next time I make it, I am going to add one more egg white because the meringue is such a nice balance to the cookies, bananas and pudding.  I am also going to use a piping bag or large ziplock to put the meringue on in little peaks instead of spreading it on in one layer, because it will look nicer when it is toasted.  Your friends will love you for this one!  Addendum: When I made this the second time, I cut the sugar to 2/3 and added an egg yolk since I wanted the extra white for the meringue.  The result was much less sweet and a little custardy.  For someone who doesn't love sugar as much as I do, this would be a great adaptation.",

He really dislikes instant pudding so this was the recipie I needed to try. He loved it!! It was a bit of work to make but they all said it was well worth it. I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge over night to that the wafers would soften. I definitely recommend doubling the recipe at least since it will all disappear quickly! I will definitely make this again.",
