I also doubled the spices with the exception of the cayenne pepper. It seemed still to be lacking something so I tried a small amount with some finely ground rosemary. What a finish!! One word about the ingredient list. Even I a seasoned (no pun intended)cook was momentarily confused by the listing--2 (49.5 oz) cans of chicken stock; and further interested in how the 49.5 oz. was arrived at since no combination of the popular can/box sizes (14 28 32 oz.) would total that amount. I settled for a 14 oz. can and a 32 oz. box of vegetable stock to good results. Who's going to quibble over 3.5 oz. anyway?",

Because my squash was large I cooked it longer than recommended so it would be really soft. The blender puree is a necessary step - don't just mash it you'll miss out on the smooth texture of the soup. Also the sherry and cream really add a depth of flavor. For seasonings I skipped the cayenne pepper and added a bit of cinnamon instead. Also I used course ground black pepper but found it distracting with the pure texture/color of the soup. Next time I'll use fine white pepper instead.",

I tried making another recipe once and it was average at best. THIS is FABULOUS! My husband was very impressed with the \"Now this is GOOD\" grunt upon devouring. One kid ate it...the other didn't.
