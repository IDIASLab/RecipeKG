I wasn't sure how that would play out but was interested enough to give it a try.  Unfortunately, it makes a better pizza dough than it does a pie crust.  I really found myself missing flaky pie crust and instead having thick, chewy bread with the berry filling, that was soggy in some parts (bottom) and tough and chewy in others.  I also didn't quite get the whole egg white in the filling thing.  Next triple berry pie I make will have floured berries, to thicken the filling a bit, and a regular pie crust, perhaps with some whole wheat flour worked into it.   An interesting take on pie, but just not to my liking - sorry!",

Yet the ingredients only call for a 1/2 cup sugar. I like Donna went ahead and combined the honey ice water and 1/2 cup flour. This recipe diden't work for me at all. I had to ditch the crust all together and tryed to salvage the filling with a store bought crust. After bakeing it it was like a cobbler. I'm going to keep looking for a mixed berry pie recipe.",

I didn't read the reviews before I made it and I didn't read over the recipe very well first either. But after I had the filling in the crust I realized that there was nothing in it to thicken it. Then I went back to the recipe and saw that it called for a TBS of flour but the directions don't include the flour so I hadn't included it. Plus I didn't think 1 TBS of flour was enought so I just added about a 1/4 cup of flour to the filling stirred it up as best I could and baked. It ended up being delicious and not the least bit runny. Oh and I used raspberries blackberries and blueberries. The recipe as is I would probably rate 1 or 2 stars but with my crust and flour to thicken it's fab.",

This allows the flour to be distributed over all the berries to thicken up the juice that comes out of the other berries. I also did not put in an egg white don't understand the point of it.
