Some of these recipes, as does this one, call for flour in the filling; some do not.  I\u2019ve tried them both ways with equally good results.  I wanted these really lime-y, so I upped the lime juice to a half cup and the lime zest to a full tablespoon.  In most cases (cake might be another story) I don\u2019t care for artificially green tinted lime desserts and by doing so I was rewarded with its classic, creamy pale yellow color.  The shortcrust pastry is tender and buttery, offset by the fresh sweet/tart lime flavor.  Not sure how the glaze would hold up on these, I chose to just stick with the traditional dusting of powdered sugar.  If you like lemon bars, Key Lime pie or any citrusy dessert for that matter, you\u2019ll find this a dependable recipe for a delightful, light and refreshing dessert.",

I didn't put the glaze on top, just a dusting of powered sugar and they were great. However, there are a few things I would change in the recipe the next time I make these. First, I did use butter instead shortening because I like the flavor in a shortbread crust much more and will do so next time also. Second, I didn't like the ratio of crust to filling, about 50/50. Next time I will double the filling. Third, I increased the amount of zest a little to about 1 tablespoon because that was how much I got from one lime and wanted to use it all. I did only use the 1/3 cup of lime juice as the recipe calls for and overall I thought the lime flavor was great. (Other reviewers suggested to use more since the flavor wasn't strong enough.) I really liked these and will make them again for sure! Thanks",

While making the middle I used 5 limes so it equaled a little more than 1/3 cup.  Also, I had to increase the glaze by an addional 1/2 batch to cover the bars entirely.  I thought they were very tasty.  I did use green food coloring as suggested, so they were pretty to look at too.

I went with some of the comments and doubled the lime juice and zest and I also used only about half of the crust and doubled the filler. Here's a list of what I liked: the glaze absolutely is necessary because the filler doesn't have any sugar so without the glaze it will be too tart the added food coloring the tartness mixed with sweet crust/glaze (it's hard to find a good tart lemon or lime bar) definitely glad I halved the crust and doubled the filling. Things I did not like: the crust was not crust like it was almost chewy...needed more flour or maybe shortening instead next time I'm going to go with the suggested amount of lime...maybe a hair more. Otherwise the bars were yummy...but remember one thing folks...use the glaze!!!!!",
