Of course I was making this for three people but two of those people have big appetites so I thought it would be fine. Hubby didn t like the texture of the shiitake mushrooms so next time I make this (yes I will make it again with changes) I plan on using cremini or regular white mushrooms. The taste was really not bad but we each did put in some sriracha as we like things to be a bit more hot/spicy. It just didn t impress. As I said though I plan on making it again cutting everything in half and changing up the mushrooms maybe throwing in some hot peppers.",
