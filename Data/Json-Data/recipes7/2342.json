Having made similar recipes before, I decided to cut into cubes and add to the wok just before the sauce.  I didn't add salt to the sauce (who needs salt when there's already so much oyster and soy sauce?).  I cut the sugar in half.  I think I'll try even less sugar next time...maybe 2 tspns?  Also, making the corn starch slurry separately and adding it at the end seemed kind of odd to me, so I just mixed the 2 tblspns water and cornstarch into the sauce before adding the sauce to the wok.  Tasted great and was also pretty easy!  I also substituted sesame oil for the peanut oil.",

Seattle dad, I don\u2019t know what sorcery you channeled to come up with this recipe, but it is the first dish I have EVER made that is just as good as take away from the excellent  local Chinese restaurant. I didn\u2019t think the bottle of oyster sauce I have had sitting in my fridge for over 3 (maybe 6?) years would ever get used, but your recipe did it. It doesn\u2019t even matter the tofu step was left out (I put it in with the ginger and garlic)\u2026 the flavour combo is outstanding. Bravo!",
