The cornstarch acts as cake flour would, making these very light and fluffy with a tender crumb.  They are, quite simply, above criticism.  Except for one thing\u2026.they are WIMPY in terms of spice!  I mean, you barely notice any spice flavor at all.  For the \u201cfour pinches\u201d each  of salt and nutmeg called for I used 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  If I were to make these again I\u2019d probably double both the cinnamon and the nutmeg and might even consider adding 1/4 tsp.  each of cloves and ginger as well.  Paired with \"Caramel Frosting IV,\" also from this site, these were a beautiful cupcake.  Don't be shy about making 'em - just add more spice! Update: Unfortunately I have to change my rating from four stars to three. While these were good and moist after I baked them, the next morning they were disappointingly dry.  Perhaps adding a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil would help.",
