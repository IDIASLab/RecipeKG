A pinch of baking powder also helps it to raise.",

This could be because my microwave runs higher than the submitter s or because it lacks a leavening agent. The flavor was good though and worth adjusting for future bakes. What I like about this cake is not only the ease in making this but having a nice dessert during the summer that doesn t need the use of an oven.",
