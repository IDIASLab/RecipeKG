First of all, I soaked my chia seeds in half cup applesauce to make the gel and used this gel instead of the butter called for. (soak  for 5 minutes)  No white sugar, just added half cup brown sugar only. Next time will try honey instead. Carrots and banana give it a moist texture but next time will try different ingredients. Great basic recipe for a healthy muffin. Love those chia seeds!",
