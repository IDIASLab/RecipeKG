If the dressing seems too tangy, I would lessen the vinegar, NOT the lime. I used EV olive oil and cut up 3 large regular tomatoes (which I seeded first). I mixed the corn and soybeans with the dressing first, than tasted a spoonful with every subsequent addition...every bite was great--you could leave out something and still have a great salad. Canned corn also works in a pinch with only a slightly less \"crunchy\" result. I have served this over salad greens alongside hot cornbread, and also with rice. My new favorite recipe!!!! =)",
