I will make this pudding-doubled-alot from now on. \nEasy to do, just measure and put it in crockpot. I took some other reviewers advice and added some vanilla and salt, doubled the recipe and cooked it on high for 3 hrs. Came out perfecto.\nMy only advice would be to break up the eggs, prior to putting in crockpot, don't just drop them in there and then wonder why it doesn't come out right. You need to break them up. Also, be sure to stir during cooking, it helps to keep everything mixed up. So, that you don't end up with layers of eggs, tapioca, etc.\nOtherwise--just enjoy eating this comfort food. ",

Sets beautifully, tastes wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe.",
