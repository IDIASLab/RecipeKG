The dough is much more spongy and sweet than pie crust, so no wonder those who use premade crusts are returning less-than-stellar reviews.  This is a great recipe, and tastes almost exactly like my mom's empanadas.  I used butter instead of shortening, and cut it down to about 3/4 cup because the dough felt right to me then.  Also cut my empanadas a little smaller and ended up with some extra filling, but that's okay with me as it gives me an excuse to make more empanadas.  :-)",

Don't forget the 1/4 tsp of baking powder which is omitted in the directions.

Second, try mixing more cinnamon and some nutmeg into the filling mixture.  I also added sweetened cream cheese into the filling, and after they were done baking I made a thin carmel icing that I dipped them into after they cooled.
