It's not regular wheat and someone with a wheat allergy or sensitivity may do fine with it (but don't take my word for it check with that individual and/or your doctor) but it does still have gluten in it and that exposure can still be dangerous for true celiacs.

Also the only Spelt flour that I had was Organic Whole Spelt All Purpose Flour so I used 4 cups of it. I put it on the WW bread cycle of my bread machine and chose a light crust cycle.

No xanthan gum and I used Spelt and Whole Wheat as I didn't have whole wheat spelt. I also crushed 2 cloves of garlic in the egg to glaze over top. Finally only needed 30 mins in the oven.
