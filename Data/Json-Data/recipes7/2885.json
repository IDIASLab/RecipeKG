My only issue was that the recipe tells you to roll the dough out and place one color on top of the other after adding the food coloring, but there was no way that was going to happen, the dough was far too sticky.  I had to refridgerate the dough overnight and then roll them out and put them together.  Then I had to return them to the refridgerator again overnight to get a clean slice and nice looking cookie.  This whole process was slightly time consuming, but otherwise they tasted good.",

As for the other baker's difficulty in the stickiness of the dough, I have never had that problem.  Add more flour to the dough if it sticks as it should roll out like a dense pie dough. Also, AR said to add one drop of food colouring (not what I had submitted), you need half a bottle to get the desired shades of vibrant green and red!",

Findings: 1st batch I made it exactly as called for in the recipe. I tried to make red and white. Dough was sticky and because of the brown sugar the white was actually tan. 2nd batch I ditched the brown sugar for white used only egg whites. White was white this time Green looked brighter as well. I couldn t tell when the cookies were actually done before they turned brown on the edges and then it was too late. They didn t look as pretty with brown edges. Batches 3 & 4 - 1. No brown sugar use white 2. No egg yolks. 3. One batch - Green / One batch Red. Added food color before flour. 4. Refrigerated the dough before rolling it out. 5. Divide each color in to three equal balls of dough 6. Rolled out dough between pieces of wax paper. 7. Reshaped the dough while rolling so I got 8 squares. Did this by rolling out the dough in to a round shape drawing the largest square possible on the rolled out down. Folding the rounded edges back into the dough squares and re-rolling. 8. Laid the two squares of rolled out colored dough on top of each other and rolled to make the spirals. Refrigerated as directed. (I only did 4 hours). 9. Sliced dough to thick or 5 mm. for cookies. 10. Cooked only 7 minutes.. did not rely on visual queue of doneness. Just took them out at seven minutes. Does not yield 72 - more like 48",

After colouring the dough (I cheated and used some kool aid to get the colors darker though they don't show up dark in the picture) I rolled the dough out on flexible cutting boards. I could easily set the colours on top or each other to adjust size. I used a dough scraper to even off the edges and make square corners. Then I flipped the dough onto the other colour and peeled back the board did this 2 times. I used the bottom cutting board to aid with rolling similar to using a tea towel to roll a jelly roll. Wrapped in waxed paper and left to cool. Delicious cookies and will be fun to play with the colours according to the season. Next time I will leave the dough in the cutting board and wrap with elastic bands. This way the dough will not get a flat bottom as it cools. Thanks for the recipe Gitano-it's making the Christmas goodie list in my house.",

Update 2/1/09 just put the dough into the freezer so I can make the cookies sooner. Wow what a difference from the first time I made them. I let the butter get really soft and it made all of the difference in rolling the dough. The dough was nice and soft and rolled very easy. I rolled each color on parchment paper and then put the one color on top of the other color and rolled. Very easy and I am sure will taste just as good as they did the last time I made them.",
