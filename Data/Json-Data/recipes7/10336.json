I was going make a Martha Stewart Cherry Clafouti, but the grocery store was out of cherries. I also needed cherry liquor, but the liquor store was closed. I did have cranberries and Grand Marnier which sounded really good. I was right on the money. It's fantastic, probably better than the cherry version. The cranberries add a nice tartness to the dish. I hope you like it.",

Previous reviewers complained that the berries were to tart, I put the berries, liquor and sugar in a saucepan and let them cook on low about 15 minutes. The sugar had dissolved into the liquor and berry juices, the berries were still firm but now infused with the sugar. Poured the liquid from the pan into the egg mixture and proceeded with the recipe as written. It turned out great!! Next time I make this I will add some orange zest in with the berry's and maybe a little granola as a crunchy garnish.",

The custuard is yummy (I even used 1/2 & 1/2 but will use heavy cream when I make it again). The cranberries need to be sweetened a little bit more I think. something was missing to make it a \"wow\" dessert. this was in the latest Allrecipes magazine so I hope others post...it certainly has potential!",

I was pretty generous with butter and sugar in the pan before adding the cranberries. There is a brown butter/caramel characteristic to the flavor. Not sure if that is due to the type of sugar or the preparation of the pan. Either way - yummy and easy dessert.",
