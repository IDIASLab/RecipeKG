Do have a few changes that I feel are an improvement and that is to not use lemon extract - the lemon rind is enough and does not taste artificial. Also if you have the time please make your own lemon curd.........much better than the jarred stuff. Thanks for a great dessert otherwise.",

Maybe just the cheesecake without the lemon curd on top or a plain cheesecake with lemon curd on top would be best for us. I didn't have whipped topping and so yesterday we tried it w/o the whipped topping; after we bought some we tried it today with the whipped topping. It's definitely better with the whipped topping.
