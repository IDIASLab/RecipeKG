The secret to success is fresh fruit juice only and it doesn't use any pre-made mixes! Don't skimp and try buying juice.  Squeeze it yourself or you won't get the best taste! If you are a real olive lover, add pimento stuffed olives and call it a 'Mexican martini'...delicious! and you won't confuse yours with anyone else's if you add 3 olives on a stirrer. :)",
