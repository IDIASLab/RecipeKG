AND (because capital letters tell you important things) I was also out of milk and had to substitute 1/2 c sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 c water instead (I went a light on the sugar to even it out). And the sifting 3 times, melting the butter in the oven in the dish and then pouring it in seemed so strange to me. But I did as instructed anyhow. And the result was.... The bread cooked for 30 minutes, came out perfect. It's perfection. Clearly with all the substitutions I had to make, and it still tastes wonderful, you just can't screw this bread up. This is my permanent recipe now. I will never go back. ",
