I then took a mango and cubed half of the fruit and blended it up w/ the orange juice/pineapple mixture and then added 1 tsp coconut extract and gave it another run through the blender. I mixed the simple syrup w/ the mango/pineapple/orange juice mixture and then added in the remaining pineapple and then took the rest of the mango and shredded it and mixed it in.

If you are juicing your own oranges you'll need to regulate the sweetness as some oranges are sweeter than others. I think I may have added too much orange rind as this flavor was very dominant. I kind of packed the rind into the measuring spoon. Err on the side of adding too little rind and your batch will come out better than mine. Also found that I couldn't taste the pineapple much. Might be because of the orange rind? I froze mine solid in a tall tupperware container. I then took it out (ran container under hot water) sliced it (carefully!) with a knife and kind of cubed it. Threw the chunks in the food processor and the result was a really nice consistency. All in all a nice recipe if you watch the rind and adjust the sugar!",

After pureeing the pineapple (canned) and adding 1 c. of OJ it only tasted like orange. I then added a cup of the pineapple juice and it balanced out nicely. I also used half the zest per other recommendations and used only half the sugar syrup. It was more than sweet enough. For anyone using the canned pineapple and complaining the sorbet was too sweet careful; you may have used crushed pineapple packed in SYRUP and not packed in pineapple JUICE which is what you should use. Made this in my ice cream maker. It does freeze very solid so thaw in fridge for an hour or two before dinner. May even have to thaw on counter. I also added a tablespoon of vodka to keep it from freezing too much. Still frozen solid. Very refereshing. I'd make it again.",
