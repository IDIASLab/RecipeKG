I added 1 tsp of sea salt to the candy mixture before cooking at a little vanilla at the end.  Despite bringing the candy to the correct temperature, this was very tacky and unpleasant to chew after it cooled.  I decided to throw it back in the oven at 250 like you would with caramel corn, since the candy mixture was very similar.  I left it in for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  I allowed it to cool in single layer on wax paper.",

I also think the corn syrup and sugar mixture should be cooked to a couple degrees less than recommended. Mine was slightly to hard, not quite soft. Overall, this is an awesome snack!",

I did toast the coconut but the almond slivers burned to a crisp while toasting, so be careful with that.  I  bought more almonds and just added without toasting. Still yummy!  Makes a HUGE batch so took some to a party, to work, etc.  Good for large gatherings.",

However other reviewers suggested putting it in a 250 degree oven for an hour (stirring every 15 minutes) and 45 minutes actually does the trick. If you're going to make the entire batch mix it up in a BIG roasting pan that you can then transfer to the oven. I lightly toasted the coconut and almonds at first because I knew they would get extra time in the oven at the end. I also used a big spatula for the stirring and coated it with PAM to make things go easier. Then spread it out on parchment paper to quickly cool like caramel popcorn. Next time I will spray the roaster with PAM as well and maybe add a little vanilla toward the end of the cooking for the sugar mixture. So good but the directions are a bit off. (Oh and you'll end up with lots of little coconut bits and almonds not attached to the cereal. I put it in a bag and will use for topping yogurt ice cream pudding etc.)",
