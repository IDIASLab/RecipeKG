You can get air bubbles if the oven temperature is too high or water in water bath is not enough. I like mine very smooth and my husband likes it with bubbles. So I make it both ways. I do add water to my syrup and sometimes few drops of vanilla too. Once it's cool I freeze the syrup so it doesn't mix with flan mixture. I blend 1 can of sweet condensed milk 1 can (I just use can as measurement) of milk and 3 eggs. I don't separate my eggs and I find that I like 3 eggs instead of 4.",

One question: I used a glass pie pan and ended up with plenty of syrup but also a dark hard mass of sugar on the pan. I feared the carmelized sugar would stick to the pan so I sprayed with just a little cooking spray. I also used two tbsp water (recommended elsewhere) to get a good syrup. Did that backfire on me? Or is it inevitable to have that disc of sugar stuck to the bottom/top? Or did I do something else wrong? Also I learned you really have to let it fully cool in the refrigerator. We couldn't wait and had the first slice when it was still a little warm. But the next day there was SO much more syrup and it had settled so nicely. Hope I have an occasion to make another again soon.",
