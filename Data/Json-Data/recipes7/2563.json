I found it having a bland taste it was very gritty/crumbly. the topping was great though. it added flaver to the top of the cake when it sunk in. The icing didnt really wow me. I tasted a bit of it once creamed together I felt the need to add a bit of milk to it. Then I heated it for about 45 seconds in the microwave. But my husband and I only ate one piece each. I was going to recommend this to my sister but not now.",

She did say she'd cut the sugar down next time (it is very rich and can cover the apple flavor) but the mixture that you pour in to the cake is so delicious and gives the cake this melted coffee-cake topping crunchiness on the edges.
