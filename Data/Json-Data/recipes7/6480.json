The changes are that I included adding 3 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and using oil instead of butter. I also used a full cup of milk, and a little more matcha powder - 3 TBS. I made those changes and my cupcakes were WONDERFUL. Perfectly tender cupcakes with a little crispy top. These are delicious!! I topped them with a quick and easy matcha glaze (about 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp matcha powder, and 1 - 2 TBS milk to thin), then dipped the slightly still warm cupcake tops in the glaze.",
