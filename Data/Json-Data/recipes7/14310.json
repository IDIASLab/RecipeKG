I prefer a ratio of more coffee than milk, but that doesn't take any stars away from this recipe. Play around with the ratio to see how you like it. You may like more chocolate or more sugar. For 1 serving, I used 1/2  cup milk. I used almond-cashew milk that was sweetened, so I used less sugar. Very yummy! Thanks for posting!",
