Not runny (I cooked the syrup about 5 minutes instead of the 1 stated as I think that is a typo).  The apricots were given to me from a friend's tree, and some where sweet and some were tart.  This would be great with peaches too. The batter is perfect to me - a sweet biscuit dough.  Definitely making this again.  It makes a lot, so cut the recipe down for a smaller batch of apricots.
