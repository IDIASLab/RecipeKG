I made a dozen muffins that baked for about 25 minutes and one 8x8 loaf for an hour. The loaf I froze right away but the muffins are absolutely delicious. The kids love them, too!",

I also did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/2 t. each allspice, ginger, cloves and fresh grated nutmeg and about 1 t. cinnamon. I cut the sugar to two cups, using half white sugar and half brown sugar. I toasted the walnut pieces and threw in about 1/2 C chocolate chips. It totally hit the spot on a chilly evening. More like pumpkin bread than zucchini bread with my changes, which is fine by me! Thanks for the recipe Dubby Jr.!",

Threw a few chocolate chips on top of a few of them to entice my 4-year old and they are a hit. I made as muffins as well and thought the 25 minute bake time recommended was perfect.",
