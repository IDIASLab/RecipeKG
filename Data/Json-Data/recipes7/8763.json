Also, by using 1/8 cup of brown sugar and 1/8 cup confectioners sugar in the crust mixture, I was able to cut the filling sugar down to 3/4 cup.  Added an extra egg yolk to the filling as well to make it more custard-y.  It was awesome I will definitely make this again.",

When you pre-cook your crust, don\u2019t let it brown too much, otherwise, after filling and baking again, it will be too brown (my bad).  I set the timer for 15 minutes and my tart filling was overcooked, so next time, I will check for doneness at 10 minutes.  I did substitute Truvia Baking Blend for the white sugar which worked out fine and added 4 Tbsp of lemon juice (one lemon) instead of 3 Tbsp.  Very nice and really very simple.",

It was simple to make and absolutely delicious as well as looked beautiful on a pretty plate. I served mixed berries and fresh cream on the side. This will be in my favorites file to bake for guests and family. For those who have a problem with the pastry it's important to cream the butter and confectioners sugar well and mix in the flour til it's like \"putty\". Then it's easy to pat into a greased pan.... and a hint when squeezing fresh lemons is to put them in the microwave for 15 seconds as the juice flows more freely. One lemon gave me almost 4 tablespoons of juice.",
