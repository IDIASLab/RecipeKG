Word to the wise: for picky eaters, hide smoothie in an opaque glass or tumbler. I won't lie, it doesn't look appetizing but one sip and your taste buds will be sold and your tummy will dance the happy full dance! Enjoy.",

The few strawberries it had did give it a muddied color so just for eye appeal I doubled the spinach giving a greener smoothie and much more appetizing look although the smoothie was delicious before that. I didn't have tofu so I tossed in some cashew milk.",

I only gripe here would  be thinking that this drink was protein packed with 1 ounce of tofu.  It does have protein with it but is not high in amount. I ended up adding a scoop of my own unsweetened, unflavored soy protein powder which also added thickness.  Overall the flavor is very good.  But if you are looking for a one dish meal of veggie/protein, it is lacking.  Thank you for the recipe!",
