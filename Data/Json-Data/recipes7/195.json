I used a dried chipotle chile pepper. Next time I will cut the pepper by half...it was very spicy. I even used more than the called for sugar to try & cut through the spicyness. Luckily I served this w/ Mango Madness Salad (from this site) which really helped cool things off. I will make again but I will cut back on the chile. I loved the sugary garlic pieces...next time I am making some candied garlic cloves to use as a garnish. (boil about 10 cloves in a cup of water for about 8 minutes or until water is mostly gone. Add a couple of tbp of sugar & cook stirring constantly until sugar is golden brown...turn out onto greased pan or parchment paper)",
