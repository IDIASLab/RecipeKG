Maybe it's because I used greek yougurt. I used agave syrup for sugar and grapeseed oil for butter. Overall I like the ingredients and the pancakes are very filling so maybe I'll give them another try with less salt and the extra liquid.",

I used almond milk to thin my batter a bit. I also added a touch of vanilla and didn't use as much salt as called for. Personal tastes I guess. Oh i also used a gluten free flour instead of all purpose which may account for the thickness. I loved the yogurt and they were light and tasty. I will definately add this to my recipe box to use again. With fresh strawberries and whipped cream they were a nice anniversary breakfast item. Thank you Samie. These were much better than my previous almond flour pancakes.",
