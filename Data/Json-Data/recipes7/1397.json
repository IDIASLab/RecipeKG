I liked the stuffing itself although I thought it could use more seasoning more of a mix of the sweet and savory. I think the recipe called for too much vinegar in the sauce - and overall I really didn't think the prune sauce complimented but more battled with the flavors in the stuffing. I like the idea of this recipe and maybe with some adjustments it could be very interesting.",
