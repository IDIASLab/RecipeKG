In the future I would start checking for doneness at 20 minutes (oven temps do vary). This is a fairly expensive cookie with 1 cup of pine nuts so just be cautious and don t overcook. I really like the crispy crushed corn flake exterior and you definitely can taste the richness of the pine nuts. Also this is not a super sweet cookie which appeals to me. I followed the recipe to the letter ended up with 36 (not 24) cookies using a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop and only needed 3 cups of crushed corn flakes. Very nice just a little overcooked but that s easily corrected. Would make again!",
