Next put about a 1/2 cup of brown suger in a bowl and add to that a teaspoon of cinnamon, about 3 or 4 tablespoons of a amaretto, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Mix them well together, then add the apples to this. Cover them well and let them stay in that a couple of hours before cooking. This is well worth the time, delicious. Next, when you have your butter melted add the suger and cinnamon to the pan and let the mixture melt together a bit. Becomes a smoother blend. Next, where I live Mountain Dew is not available so I used an orange soda and the result was also yummy. I will provide a photo next time I make this as mine looks very different from this one. I hope everyone enjoys these changes.",

I'm more of an eater than a cook so I was looking for an easy way to duplicate my Fair experience. When reading the recipe I thought it would not be as good but I figured I'd give it a shot. WOW!! This was perfect, from start to finish my wife and I were eating in about an hour and a half. The prep time is almost nil and let it let me enjoy the eating part so much sooner than other recipes I found. I will try others but for a quick desert to make after a long days work there probably isnt anything as good for so little effort! I used Butter Flake crescent rolls and no other substitutions and Butter Pecan ice cream! I also threw on some pecans before shoving it in the oven. I wasnt to keen on using Mountain Dew but the Dew does what its supposed to dew! :) I highly recommend this dish!",

After tweaking the recipe the first few times i made it, i think i finally have perfected it. First I add 1/2 cup of unpacked light brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of all white. I add 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the butter/sugar mixture, I sprinkle the rolls with chopped pecans or walnuts before baking them, and I use far less than an entire can of mountain dew (more like 1/2-2/3). I'm honestly not sure if this makes a difference cause it's the only way i've ever done it, but i melt the butter in a pan and add the sugars cinnamon and vanilla while its still on the heat. then after a couple minutes i spoon it over the rolls. Also, serve with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream...amazing.",
