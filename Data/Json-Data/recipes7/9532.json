I plan to play around w/ this recipe, reducing the paste, and maybe upping the other ingredients. I allowed this to simmer a little over an hour, but it was still a tad too thin for me, so I will maybe adjust the water, as well. This is a great jumping off point, though...Thanks for sharing. :)",

I had no relish but had sweet pickles which I chopped and most importantly I had no Worcestershire sauce so I searched for a substitute and discovered I could use steak sauce thus I used 2tbls steak sauce. I also tossed in 2tsp tabasco as that was also suggested as a substitute. It resulted in a sauce that was slightly too sweet but the children gobbled it up. It turned out great on the salty (IMHO) Costco hot dogs.",
