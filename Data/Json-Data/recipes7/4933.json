Squeeze fresh lemon juice on top when they are hot and then sprinkle with sugar/cinnamon. Yum! Thanks for the recipe. Give it a try!",

As an Ottawa native these are the best homemade i have ever had! i like these better than rightt on the Canal because they don't freeze up as fast! a great variation for this shape is the make balls and gently drop them into the oil then roll in the cinn sugar mix before cooling. as a beaver tail you can be creative with the toppings as well i have seen pretty much everything for sweet to savoury (and sometimes gross!) be inventive and have fun! enjoy these around a campfire or around a local rink!",
