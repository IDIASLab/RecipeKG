I agree with Zedar....there isn't enough crust.  I used Pampered Chef deep dish pans and it was really close. If you're expecting to made a beautiful fluted shell, it's not going to happen the way the recipe is presently.  I will add 1/4 cup more flour, 2 more tablespoon of butter and enough water for it to get it to a ball stage.  The taste and flakiness complimented the spinach quiche and ham quiche that I made this evening for dinner.  Both crust turned golden brown, and I didn't prebake the crust.  I will use this recipe again as I experiment with some different quiche recipes that I am trying out on my family.  Thanks for sharing Joanna!  :)",

I used this for a bottom crust for a homemade pot pie, using garlic mashed potatoes as a top crust. Turned out great. Next time, I'll not wait until the last minute and make the pie dough in the morning. The longer this crust sits in the fridge, the less likely it is to warm under hot hands. Great recipe!

I've made this twice now, and once I used havarti instead of cheddar, as that's what I had on hand.  The havarti gave the crust a lovely, delicate taste, but beware: Since havarti has a high moisture content, you don't need as much water.   Also, here's a tip for everyone: If you freeze the butter briefly (maybe 10 minutes or so, no longer!) before cutting into small pieces, it makes it much easier.",

It turned out a little over 24 mini ham bacon spinach and swiss cheese quiche. I've made them a few times friends and family are dying for the recipe. Very tasty- great results. if you are a health nut this is not the quiche crust for you. It was a little greasy but no one complained. My 88 yr. old grandmother ate about 3 or 4 of these mini quiche- and she's a picky eater... lol and then there is my 37 yr old cousin who hate vegetables but tried them despite the spinach content.:-) Have fun with this recipe everyone its certainly a keeper!",

It bakes golden and light and tastes like a cheese cracker. I used my broccoli-mushroom-onion-bacon-cheddar recipe using evaporated milk instead of regular. This is the best quiche I've ever made! I started to bake the unfilled crust as the directions said but saw it was shrinking. So I removed it from the oven and stretched it back into shape filled it with the quiche mixture and baked it. It came out so good! I recommend that instead of pre-baking this crust you just fill it and bake all at once. Thank you for the great recipe.",

I did add a bit more flour than called for so I could get all the butter mixed in. It definitely needs cooled before rolling out. I was impatient so I put in the freezer for a while instead of letting cool in the fridge. I had more than enough crust for one quiche--maybe those who have had too little have larger pans? I used my regular quiche pan for this and a regular sized pie pan would've been fine as well. I used this with the Salsa Sausage Quiche recipe on here. Thanks for the recipe!",
