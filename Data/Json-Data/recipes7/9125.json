Per other reviews, I doubled the batch and pureed half the canned tomatoes to reduce tomato chunks. I didn't have parsley so I used dried basil. About the milk, since I doubled the batch, I was prepared to add 4 cups of the whole milk. I added 3 cups and I wish I had cut it back even more. The taste of the soup was excellent before adding the milk (I taste at different stages) and the volume (3 cups) in my opinion diluted the taste too much. I suggest putting in half the milk and then tasting it before adding the rest so you can adjust to your liking. I'm going to try fresh basil next time because the dried basil was an excellent addition. This I think is an great base recipe that is forgiving with regard to substitutions. I served with grilled provolone/American cheese and ham sandwichs ... family loved it!",

As a kid tomato soup always was my favorite and it's still right up there in the top 3 as an adult. Considering there are no fresh tomatoes in it this actually is a pretty nice soup tasting a lot like tomato bisque and not so much like something out of a can. Do let it cook for a little while (maybe 10-15 minutes) as the flavor does improve with a little simmering. Thanks Rachel I like it and will make again.",

We did not have dried parsley so I used dried basil instead. I did not have a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice (I only had a 14 oz can of garlic fire roasted tomatoes) which I used. I did however have a huge fresh tomato in the fridge. I blanched the tomato and then diced it...just wonderful. I took the suggestion of the other reviewers when it came to adding the milk. I only used a cup and it was perfect! I also added a little fresh chopped spinach to the soup. My kids had one taste and now can't wait till dinner. We are having this tonight for dinner with grilled cheese (provolone cheddar and American cheese)...YUM!! Thanks so much for this recipe!",
