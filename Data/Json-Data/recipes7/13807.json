But we loved the flavor and the texture was great, though I will also admit I made several substitutions due to pantry availability...  1 Tbsp lime juice + 1 Tbsp brown sugar replaced the tamarind paste. I added red onion, red, yellow, and green bell pepper (probably 1/4 c total) while the chicken was cooking, and used 2 c cabbage and 1/2 c celery instead of bean sprouts. I also omitted the green onion and oyster sauce. It was a hit with everyone though!",

My local store did not have tamarind paste so I opted to purchase Thai Kitchen's Pad Thai sauce and then I did not by the Oyster Sauce. Once everything was spiralized chopped or cut the recipe went together super quick. My husband had finished off all the roasted peanuts in the house so we topped it with roasted sunflower seeds instead. We liked the result but our sauce was not really true to the recipe. The use of zucchini as noodles is a favorite here.",
