I took my frozen rhubarb out to thaw at lunchtime so I would be ready to go when I came home from work.  I added some strawberries since I didn't have enough rhubarb - also reduced the sugar to 1 cup as others suggested (thank you for that) - and added a touch of cinnamon both to the sour cream mixture and to the crumb topping.  Boy oh boy, if you love sweets made with rhubarb, you gotta try this!  Thank you so much for posting the recipe! It's a really pretty pie!",
