I was only able to find a 750 ml bottle of Everclear, so I adjusted the recipe down to about 30 servings, and used the zest of 9 lemons. I put it in a large glass jar, and will let it sit in the cellar for a month--and I'll update my review then! EDIT 9/2/19: Finally got around to editing my review! Since I scaled this down to 30 servings, the recipe called for 3 cups water and 3 cups sugar for the simple syrup--and we used all of it to suit our tastes. This was really pretty easy to make, and it tastes fantastic (particularly when added to a some iced tea)! It's very lemony, and perfectly sweet without being overwhelming. Will definitely be making this again!",
