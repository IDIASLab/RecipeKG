I used the \"Cheese Filling\" recipe from this site and spread it over the dough prior to cutting the strips.  I was looking for a cheese danish flavor and it went so well with the raspberry.  I used a pizza wheel to cut the strips and also used a pizza pan for baking it.  To apply the raspberry preserves, I used a pastry bag so I could squeeze a nice amount into the blossoms.  So YUMMY!  Love that raspberry flavor!  Thank you Sarah-May for sharing such a BEAUTIFUL YUMMY recipe!",

Used regular active dry yeast and 6 cups of flour and the dough was somewhat tacky, but not to worry, flour your hands to handle the dough and after the first rise, the dough will be perfect.  My dough rolled out two 15\" discs.  I cut 6 wedges per quarter and the first disc came out perfect.  I baked it for 30 minutes and then quickly brushed on soften butter all over the blossom and filled it with apricot/pineapple preserve.  For the second disc, I made one of my favorites~Cinnamon Roll Blossom~Deliciously stupendous!   Spectacular presentation for various combinations of fillings!  Definitely a Treasure!

                "reviewBody": "Sarah, you most certainly have a winner here. This was fabulous and like the others have said, the dough was incredibly easy to work with. I did end up using a total of about 7 cups of flour before it was over with though. I don't know if the humidity here just required more or what but it was wonderful. They turned out HUGE. Since I had two to serve to my guests for Easter brunch, I did one with raspberry jam and flavored the glaze for that one with almond extract. The other one and probably my favorite was filled with a lemon-pear marmalade and topped with almonds. The glaze on this one was the one you recommend and I mean to tell you that this was a very nice and a really unexpected treat for everyone here. There really are so many things  you can do with this and I intend to try some other combos soon. My daughter and I put these together and I think that for her to see that yeast is not as intimidating as she thought, she may give it a shot herself. UPDATE; I made this again for Mother's Day and took the advice of WFDM, using almond paste for one, and the lemon -pear marmalade for the other. I also spread each filling on the dough prior to being cut so that some of it would be intertwined in the bun. Great idea and one I'll be doing from now on. The almond paste was a bit too stiff to spread, so after breaking off pieces of it, I used my rolling pin to press it into the dough. Worked like a charm.",

                "reviewBody": "We loved this bread, it had wonderful flavor.  However, I took the advice of SHORECOOK and made the cheese filling from this site.  I have NO idea how she got the cream cheese not to ooze everywhere while twisting the strips.  My first \"blossom\" I did as she did - spread the filling before cutting the strips.  This resulting in ooey gooey mess all over my counter, hands, the pan, everywhere, and not much filling in the rosettes.  My second blossom I formed first and the added a big dollop of cheese filling in the wells before baking. While this worked way better, this shape does not lend itself to holding much filling at all, and a lot of it oozed out onto the pan.  None of this was the fault of the recipe, though, so can't rightly take any stars off.  Either way, we loved the taste, but I would probably not repeat the shape next time, as we like more than a teaspoon of filling per serving.  Also, one last note - the instructions say to roll to a 12-in circle, mine were MUCH bigger than this.  If I did repeat this shape, I would make 3 smaller blossoms, not 2 huge ones.  All in all, I WILL make this bread again, just tinker it to suit our tastes.",

I thought the glaze was a nice touch and went well with the raspberry jam although I went quite light when drizzling it on. It's nice that this recipe can be halved easily. I wasn't serving a large crowd so I halved it but used two whole eggs. On the other hand if making the whole recipe the great thing is it's versatility in that you can vary the jam glaze and other add-ons to give variety when making two loaves. I really look forward to making this again and trying on some different flavors. Thanks for bringing this recipe together Sarah-May!",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic recipe and much easier to make than it looks! I've made this 3 times and I've come up with some steps that make it even easier: 1) I cut the recipe in half and make the dough in my bread machine; 2) I place the dough on the parchment-lined pizza pan after I roll it into a circle and cut and form it right on the pan; 3) I use kitchen scissors instead of a knife to cut the dough into strips; 4) After I form the center petal I twist all the remaining strips first then form them into petals one after another. Also I didn't care for the lemon glaze so I use a simple vanilla glaze recipe. If you're confused on how to cut and form the petals check out the photos of the recipe. They're very helpful. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!",

I would use the dough recipe again because it is very tasty for a roll. The shape is wonderfull! it came out just like in the picture or even better!!! I am going to use this shape again for sure. Thank you so much for this beautiful presentation.",
