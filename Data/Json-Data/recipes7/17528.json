The addition of sesame seeds makes the pies crunchy, but they are optional. This is a hand pie with layers of dough and sweet filling that melts in your mouth and is my personal favorite.

However, this was simply due to the fact that this is a tough recipe. The recipe itself is well-written and the video serves as an excellent guide. \n\nAnd the flavour... GREAT! This is somehow a difficult and a forgiving recipe at the same time. Mine looked nothing like the author's when they went into the oven but they were golden brown when they came out and they were a hit with my family. \n\nDefinitely going to make these again and definitely going to swear up a storm when I do!",
