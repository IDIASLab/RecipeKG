If I come across my copy in the kitchen, I'll compare.\n\nWe made it exactly like the recipe except for using stick margarine rather than butter.\n\nThe cookies were made for a holiday cookie swap at work, so I didn't get to eat many, but I feel like my Mom's recipe kind of melted in the mouth a bit more.  Since the last  cookie I ate was a bit stale, it may have affected my perceptions and memories.\n\nEven with a slight texture variance, even not getting to eat many, they were phenomenal.  Brought back so many memories.",
