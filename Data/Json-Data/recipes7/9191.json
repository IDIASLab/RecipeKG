The batter looked good but when I topped it with the filling I should have trusted my instincts and stopped when I saw enough was enough (about halfway through). I also had a sudden memory of a similar cake I tried from this site remembering the cake was basically ruined by an excess of this same kind of filling. I carried on using the full amount of filling and shouldn't have. The cake didn't bake properly even caving somewhat. At least that will not be seen when the cake is turned over I thought. But I knew it was caving for a reason. Cutting into it my fears were realized - there was far too much filling not just from a taste perspective but it was just too much for the cake to handle. It made the cake too heavy almost wet and too sweet - not to mention unattractive. Years ago Hubs wisely told me that if I'm not enjoying a book I shouldn't force myself to read it as there are so many more books I'd enjoy better and never enough time to read them all. For similar reasons with this cake I did not keep it.",

I do not know why the single reviewer had a problem with the filling because it was obvious from the recipe that the filling was perfectly balanced-not too little not too much which made me want to try it. I had enough faith in it that I made it for a coffee club meeting at my house. The tang from the rhubarb and the sweet from the filling made this one of the best cakes I have ever made! All of the ladies wanted the recipe and spent several minutes discussing why the review was so horrible when the cake is so superb. They decided it was either an amateur cook or a bad oven because the cake was moist not wet it rose beautifully and the cinnamon sugar dusted on top was the perfect finish. My husband is not a big sweet eater but he asked me to save him some just from the smell of it baking. After tasting he asked me to hold on to this recipe as he would ask for it again.",
