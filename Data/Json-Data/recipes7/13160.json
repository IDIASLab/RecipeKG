( the 'Jelly' is a 14oz or so bag of mixed frozen berries simmered with 2 tbsp real maple syrup. I simmer the entire time I prep and cook pancakes. I Blend in a blender and use just like syrup can add a bit of water or more maple syrup to taste, and for thinness of syrup) \nThis is the first time I made flax seed and almond milk pancakes, they were devoured by my guys. Tomorrow I'm going to attempt to adapt the recipe for 'pineapple upside down pancakes'",

I made one change and that was to use ground flax instead of flax seeds. The taste of these was fine but the pancakes were heavy and slightly gummy tasting. Maybe the ground flax caused this. If I were to make soymilk pancakes again I would just use my favorite recipe and substitute the milk. Thank you for the recipe idea; we enjoyed trying it for breakfast.",
