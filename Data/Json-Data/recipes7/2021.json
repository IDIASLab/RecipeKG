I'm just not a mayo fan and I wasn't brave enough to try it tonight. However with the other ingredients it was very nice. A bit sweet but not too sweet and I like the use of grenadine in this dip. I certainly wouldn't have thought of that myself! We ate with strawberries but I think would be good with other fruit too especially apples. Thanks for the recipe.",

And I must say that the mayo does \"weigh\" the flavor down - the distinct mayo taste comes through even after melding in the fridge overnight. I tried adding more (powdered) sugar but that just made it more sweet. I tried a touch of white balsamic vinegar and that helped. However the second time I made it without the mayo it came out quite great much \"fresher\" and light. The grenadine is what makes this dip.",

Gave it a nice strawberry taste and made up for no grenadine. Wouldn't have added mayo anyway (yuck!). I made less than recipe so basically mixed half more yogurt than there was cream cheese. As yogurt was flavored and sweet enough just added approx. 2 tsps. sugar. Whipped it all up put in fridge approx. 1 hour and it was ready to go! Delicious! And big hit with my mixed fruit tray.",
