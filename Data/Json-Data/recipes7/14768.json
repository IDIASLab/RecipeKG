Both were good calls that I will do again if I make this again, and next time around I'd add vanilla in the cake and more sugar in both cake and filling. It also definitely needed to bake for a solid hour. Also, note on the parchment paper: I love to bake cakes with parchment paper. I'm lazy and hate to cut the paper to fit the pan, and I usually don't mind a somewhat a warped cake. For this cake, though, its worth the effort of cutting the paper into a rectangle that fits on the bottom and a long, wide ribbon that wraps around the sides.",

My daughter's favorite foods are carrot cake and bourbon, so I wanted to make this for her.   I found the texture to be a little gummy, probably because of yogurt combined with the moisture of the carrots.  I have made other quick breads with yogurt and did not have this problem. I found the bourbon cream cheese to be lacking in flavor.  If I made it again I would use bourbon extract instead of alcohol.  But, unfortunately there are so many good recipes out there I probably will not make it again.",

I baked in a round 9\" pan; put 1/2 carrot cake batter in then the cheesecake batter in big dabs and then the remaining 1/2 cake batter. Then I swirled it. To batter I did add some (1/3 cup) maple syrup and used sour cream instead of yogurt (only fruit flavored in house). Put in some extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice after reading the first two reviews. The cake rose fine baking tested done but as SOON as I took from oven it fell. Taste was good but texture wasn't what I wanted. It either wasn't quite done or I should have stuck with a loaf pan and/or not added the maple syrup. Not sure which. My picky family liked it however. I put vanilla ice cream on the side. I will try recipe again and stick to pan size recommended and no maple syrup added to batter.",
