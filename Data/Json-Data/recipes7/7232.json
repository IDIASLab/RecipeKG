I used butter in place of the shortening and I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract because I am used to adding this to cake recipes and felt it would be a good addition to this recipe. And one last thing, I bake my cake in an 8X8 pan and it was done in 30 minutes. That is much shorter than the 50 called for in the recipe. So be aware that your bake could be much shorter too.  This is a delicious recipe as is, but I think even better with the few changes I mentioned. Thanks for the recipe!",
