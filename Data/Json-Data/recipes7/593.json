My mother is a \"professional\" at candy-making, so I tried some of her tips...Do not add the peanuts initially -- only the sugar, corn syrup, milk -- stir constantly over medium/med-high heat until candy thermometer registers around 240 -- or firm, soft ball forms when poured into ice water.  This takes about 12-15 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in butter, vanilla, red coloring. Stir in peanuts, drop immediately onto greased pan. Sticks horribly to waxed paper! I found Planters red spanish peanuts and they were great in this!",

The problem is that the recipe gives a range of what you should cook the mixture to. I should have known better, but being impatient I only cooked it to 234 degrees. In order for the candy to set-up properly into patties, it has to be cooked to 240 without stirring. Consequently, I poured the entire mixture into a jelly roll pan and have a large pan that I can eat with a spoon. The taste is excellent, and I may even try it again sometime, but I'll be sure to cook it to 240.",

I will try the evaporated milk to see if I like it better. Also instead of just pouring these out to cool I let them cool down about 10 minutes then stir them until they seem to lose their \"sheen\". At that point I quickly spoon them into portions. It is labor intensive so be prepared to stir stir stir. You will be rewarded.",
