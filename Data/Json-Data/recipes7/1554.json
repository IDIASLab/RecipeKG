Rather, it is more like cherry syrup.  It is in my grocery store in the produce section, near several varieties of specialty/organic juices.  The kind I buy is made by Brownwood acres, but there are other brands out there (and I have seen blueberry and pomegranet concentrate as well--I may have to do more experimenting!!).  Tart cherry concentrate is advertised for joint pain--I don't know about that, but it tastes great, and is super-sour and full of flavor and color!",

Couldn't find the cherry juice concentrate so I used grenadine (as another reviewer suggested). I used Stoneybrook farms organic french vanilla yogurt and added some mini chocolate chips during the last 5 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly and we had the most flavorful creamy ice cream I've ever made. My guests thought it was Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Das!!!!!! They were shocked when I told them it was home-made. It was just as good the next day... no ice crystals. I'm looking forward to experimenting with this same base recipe but different fruits... will try peach as soon as they come in season.",
