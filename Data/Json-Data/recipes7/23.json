I make it a little different I omit the sugar and add a drained can of mandarin oranges and combine everything in my blender. Not only do my kids love them but so do my husband and I. And all the neighborhood kids. And their friends.:) This also makes a good summer pie. Fold the whipped topping in carefully pour into a graham cracker crust and stud the top with mandarin oranges. TIP: When making the pops pour them into dixie cups and freeze them until sturdy then stick the popsicle sticks in. This way they'll stay put and won't fall over or come out wonky. EDITED AGAIN: I should clarify. You need 20 oz. of orange soda. Not a whole two liter. A whole two liter is excessive. And you know you don't need a ice cream maker. You can just use your blender. An option you can use as well is fat free condensed milk and whipped topping.",

I had to give the recipe to everyone.  We also discussed that you could modify it and use grape soda or strawberry soda for some variety.  Great recipe.",

I didn't use the 2 liters of Sunkist; I just used about 2 cans and even then my ice cream maker was full to almost overflowing. I made into popsicles but I'm sure you could make into scoop ice cream and it would work just as well. Next time I think I will follow tat2whttrash's recommendation to make this in the blender--I don't have a blender but could use it in my food processor. Once frozen these melt pretty quickly so if you need to repackage them work fast. Thanks for the recipe.",
