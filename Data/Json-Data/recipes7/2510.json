The recipe says to simmer 10 minutes until the liquid is absorbed. Absorbed by what? There is no rice or pasta or anything else to absorb this liquid. The cabbage just wilted away to nothing and I'm sure contributed to the soupiness. We scooped out the chicken and wilted cabbage with a slotted spoon to place some on a lettuce leaf but it was impossible to eat this way. The juice ran down my chin and my arm and got all over everything. We used up 4 paper towels cleaning up our faces arms and plates. I finally just cut up the rest of the lettuce and put the chicken on top to make a salad. It was still a runny mess. This was very tasty but I'm not sure I'd make it again without some major changes.
