A small amount of prep. time, a day in the slow cooker, and you'll be amazed! It sounds too simple to be good... TRUST me! This gets RAVE reviews when we make it! The amount of vegetables is only an estimate. Use as many or as few as you choose. When it's done, you will have a yummy gravy, and will have to carefully dig for the steak pieces.",

I typically use a lot of seasonings in the flour... Mrs. Dash, lemon pepper, garlis salt, etc.  have fun with it!  Also, The longer it's cooked in the slow cooker, the better - for GOOD steakes 8 hours is the minimum!  Also - it should read 2-3 onions and 2-3 peppers - the more the better!  Enjoy!",

Will try 3/4 cup next time.  I used 2 large green and 2 large red peppers and 3 medium-sized onions.  Also took part of another reviewers suggestion and used Italian Style Stewed Tomatoes instead of crushed.  The other suggestion about adding 2 beef broth cubes was a winner too.  This FILLED my 4.5 quart slow cooker to the brim!  When all was tender . . . served over egg noodles.  WOW!  Will be trying again with sliced roast.  Thanks for the recipe :-)",

It already has the bell peppers and the onions in it along with some other spices. Using these tomatoes takes either the bitterness or sweetness you get from using regular canned crushed tomatoes (they are always different). Also add some extra garlic and serve over egg noodles",

I served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes (also from this site). I used stew meat and it came out so tender it was falling off my fork! I also added 2 beef broth cubes and I obmitted the red pepper. Another reviewer commented it was a sloppy mess it is kinda sloppy as the meat is so tender that it breaks up and it is kinda like a stew. But it tasted so good I didn't mind for leftovers the next day I piled it on top of a slice of bread YUMMY!",
