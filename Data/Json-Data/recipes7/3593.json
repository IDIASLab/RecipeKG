The most popular one so far is the original recipe, but with vanilla bean along with the almond, and then raspberry preserves whipped with buttercream filling. I also throw in lemon zest and juice (omitting the almond) and orange zest and juice with a honey simple syrup brushed on the baked and cooled cake. This is my favorite cake recipe, great texture, crumb, very moist, but holds up when handling it to make larger wedding cakes. And holds Marshmallow Fondant (found on this site) beautifully. Thank you so so so much for sharing with us!!\n *** Just an update.*** I know several people wonder if this can adapted to a choc cake. I have done this several times now. Here's what I do: I use Duncan Hines Dark Choc Fudge. Instead of 1c flour i use 2/3c flour and 1/3 cocoa powder. I use Ghirardelli. It comes out wonderful. Hope this helps !",

You can easily change  out the white cake mix and almond flavoring and flavor it to your liking (Lemon cake mix w/ vanilla flavoring.. etc.). I also use flavored coffee creamer (liquid version) opposed to water and sometimes yogurt instead of sour cream (in coordinating flavor). I also add 1/2 a packet of pudding mix to make it super moist(instant, dry). Also it does NOT matter if the cake mix already 'has pudding' in it. That is simply a marketing technique. I prefer BC white cake mix, but yellow I prefer DH. Make sure you sift both. The resulting cake will be pretty dense (and SUPER MOIST) in comparison to a typical box cake(it's supposed to be a hybrid scratch cake)and sturdy enough to hold fondant. If you are carving the cake, omit the pudding packet. ",

I used a whipped icing and filled layers with pineapple. .I am thinking the next one should have strawberry layers, then trying a lemon  cake mix with pineapple the next time. I made this in 3 round cake layers and it took about 38 minutes to bake. So good, don't look any further. This is better than the most expensive cakes I have had at weddings. The secret to a light cake is to mix as directed but add the whipped egg whites to the batter the last minute not with the other ingredients, otherwise, you will have a denser cake, not a light one. Absolutely worthwhile. Been baking over 38 years and this is the best white cake.",

I made this for my husband's 30th birthday party and everyone loved it.  This is way better than some of the cakes I've ordered from bakeries.  Definitely try this and follow exactly, I wouldn't add anything.  I frosted with a simple vanilla almond buttercream icing, 3 c. confectionary sugar, 1/3 c. butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1-2 Tbsp. milk.  Make sure to read the recipe correctly to use the right size pan.  I read too fast and used a 7x11 inch pan and it came out perfectly but very high and took forever to bake at 325. I think a 9x13 would be fine also.  thank you CUPYCAKESMURF!  ",

Most pan sizes will take roughly 1 hour.  Watch for a tiny hairline crack around the edge where the cake has just begun to release from the pan.  In some recipes, that would be \"over-done\", but the sour cream in this recipe makes the cake shrink slightly more than normal.  The exact moment of center done-ness usually coordinates with the appearance of that hairline crack.  \n\nAlso, with the new, smaller 15oz Betty Crocker boxes (not cool, Betty!), you'll need to reduce the water to 1 cup + 2 Tblsp",

I didn't have enough sour cream and used about 2.5 oz of softened cream cheese to make up the difference and get to 1 cup.  Also,  I added about 1 cup of melted semisweet chocolate to 3 cups of the batter, and spooned some of each batter into the liners to make \"half and halfs.\"  I got 24 generously filled cupcakes and one 8\" round cake.  I remember hoping that they were worth all the effort. Wow - they are AMAZING.  I am definitely a frosting fan, but I could fully enjoy this cake with nothing on it at all. It's perfectly sweet, very moist, somehow dense and light at the same time - and the flavor is wonderful. This recipe is definitely in my \"go-to\" collection now. Absolutely yummy.",

Other than that, it didn't seem to change the texture at all.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I make and decorate cakes all the time and on the lookout for new recipes, but not this one.",
