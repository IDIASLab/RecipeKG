The rum chata gave an awesome flavor to the shrimp and it was super easy to just marinate for a few hours and sprinkle chicken seasoning on the kebabs. Our charcoal didn\u2019t light well, so we finished off the kebabs under the broiler, but otherwise cooked according to the recipe. Amazing and easy.",
