I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, almond milk instead of cow's milk, coconut oil instead of olive oil. I also used dark cocoa because that is all I had.  I cooked for 50 seconds.  The result was great.  I will never use eggs again for my mug cakes.  Next time, I will try it with oat flour instead of wheat flour to make it gluten free :)",

Although you can omit the chocolate chips I feel like it would be a lot better with them. Next time I want to make a mug cake I will use this recipe it's defiantly worth a try. Just use chocolate chips. Update: I made it a second time but with slight changed to the recipe. As I last said I didn't use the chocolate chips or almond flakes. I substituted olive oil (last time it had a bit of an olive oil taste) with coconut oil (equal amount) and added a bit of water maybe about a tablespoon. This drastically improved the recipe. I would pair it with whipped cream ice cream and add chocolate chips if I had any of those but with the changes I made it tasted way better!",
