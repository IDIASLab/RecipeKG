We don't like things really sweet these days so my instinct told me just to cut it back initially (that's just our taste preference). In my mind this falls into the \"comfort food\" category and it certainly was a splurge nutritionally but it is tasty sort of like a corn pudding. It took much longer than 30 minutes to brown so I'd bump up the temperature next time to 350. Very easy to put together and we enjoyed it.",
