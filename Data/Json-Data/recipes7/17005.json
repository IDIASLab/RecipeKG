I didn't have fresh basil and meant to add dry but forgot to.  We didn't miss the basil in this dish at all.\n\nWe had it for leftovers another night but it was kind of dry after reheating.  \nI was going to add some jarred tomato sauce or something for moisture before reheating but decided against it.

I couldn't find any fresh basil so I omitted that ingredient and it was just as good.  I added dried parsley, granulated garlic, dried oregano along with the salt and pepper to give it more Italian flavoring.  I believe the secret ingredient here is the whipping cream.  I increased the amount of cheese used and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top along with the mozzarella.  I love cheese so there can never be too much.  I will definitely make this again!",
