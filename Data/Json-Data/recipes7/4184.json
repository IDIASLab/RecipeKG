Italian seasoning to it. To the chopped onion I also added 4 small cloves of garlic that I pressed through a garlic press. Then for the top coating of bread crumbs I substituted crushed up Ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs for a little different crunchy flavor. This also makes great leftovers.

I like for it to still maintain some of its firmness and this cuts out extra steps. That's the only thing that I did differently... Like someone posted earlier, you wouldn't pre-boil potatoes for a potato casserole, so I never understood the step of pre-boiling squash. Also, summer squashes can be and are eaten raw in salads and with dips, so I recommend skipping boiling. The recipe will still turn out perfect!",

Personal taste preferences and spiciness of other dishes influence how to season it. Many reviewers used seasoned bread crumbs which is a good idea. Next time, might try a little nutritional yeast for a subtle nutty cheesy flavor. We cut the butter in half and used panko bread crumbs which produced a topping with a crunchy texture. Really liked the firm texture of this dish as some squash casseroles can be watery but not this one. Found the oven temp and baking time to be spot on. Will make again. Melissa, thanks for sharing!",
