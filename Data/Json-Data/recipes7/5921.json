I bought the non-fat dry milk powder and the applesauce but I had to wing it on a couple items. I had wheat germ but no bran so I just doubled the germ. I didn't have any cream of wheat (don't care for it) so I used grits instead. I also didn't have any bran cereal so I used Fiber One. I added some blueberries and raspberries to the mix as well and used all white whole wheat flour. These little darlings came out wonderfully! And I didn't even add the sugar the author says was left out of the recipe in error (I didn't see the post until too late). They really didn't need it. I ate four of them as soon as they were cool enough. I think I'll just go on leaving the sugar out. Thanks so much for the post babooleena these were terrific!",

I made a few changes and modifications though to make it just that much more healthy and to accommodate with what was in my cupboard. I didn't use any white flour I use all whole wheat. You can add lecithin and it will be just as soft. I didn't even use that though. I didn't have any wheat bran so I just doubled the toasted wheat germ. I added 3 heaping tablespoons of rolled oats and about 1 heaping tablespoon of chia seed. I used the whole egg to boost the nutrient and protein content. I substituted 1/2 of the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce. I did not sprinkle any sugar on top. Next time I'd like to add ground flax seed and maybe some walnuts. I was pretty skeptical of the kiddos enjoying them but the 3 year old ate at least 3 the 5 year old ate about 4 the teenagers were surprised to actually enjoy them so much I ate...too many.... Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!",

I tried omitting the sugar to make the bread healthier and it was still tasty but it felt like something was missing. Next time I'll add a bit of stevia or agave to make the bread sweet but still healthy. I also used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose (healthier) used 3/4 cup of wheat bran (didn't have Cream of Wheat or bran cereal so I upped the amount of wheat bran to compensate) and used one chopped apple instead of raisins (hate the things!) I'm looking forward to trying this bread again with a bit more sweetness.",
