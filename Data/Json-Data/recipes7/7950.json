Last night I made a batch of slow cooker apple butter (almost same ingredients as yours ) but it just wasn't right. I went looking for more recipes to see what I was missing and I found yours. I wasn't crazy! I added the butter to my batch and PERFECT! Thanks some much.",

Instead I peeled cored and sliced 5 lbs. of apples 1 c. sugar 1 c. brown sugar 1/4 c. butter 1 T. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg. I cooked this for about 2 1/2 hours stirring occasionally and then poured into my blender and blended this real good. Pour into 3 2qt. clean canning jars with rings and lids. Let the butter cool and seriously this is closer to apple sauce then apple butter. Yummy Great for gift giving.",
