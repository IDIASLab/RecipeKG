I used 1/2 cup butter instead, with 2 good sized bananas & 1 large egg, which seemed to be a good PB to B ratio and it made the dough more like Peanut Butter Cookie dough... So I dropped them by rounded tablespoon, then flattened them & sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, per someone else's suggestion.  Oh yeah, at the beginning I pureed the bananas with the butter and added a little honey, then stirred in the other stuff...using 1/2 dark brown & 1/2 light brown sugar.  Turned out great!",
