The cake-cookie is moist, rich and delicious but not too sweet then you put cream cheese frosting on it which is sweet and it has the perfect balance. I made some of the changes other people did (increased flour to 2.5 cups, used 2 eggs) also for spices I added 1/2 tsp of cloves (which I use in my pumpkin pies) and increased Cinnamon to 1 1/4 tsp. As for the cream cheese frosting I like mine more \"cream cheesy\" so I used: One 8oz package cream cheese, blend with 1/2 cup butter, add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, then slowly beat in 1 cup of powdered sugar or slightly more as desired for sweetness/stiffer consistency.",
