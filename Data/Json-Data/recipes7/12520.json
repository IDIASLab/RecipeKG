Using the pan I started the chicken in and the leftover flour from coating the chicken I made the sauce. Paired the chicken up with egg noodles and a salad. An excellent dinner and everyone was happy. Oh yes I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because thats what I had on hand and we like the thighs better anyway.",
