The only thing I did different was I boiled a leg and thigh section of chicken in a separate pot until tender then shredded it and added it to the simmering soup.  I also used about a tablespoonful of powdered chicken soup base but powdered chicken bouillon would also work just as well and I reduced my salt accordingly. I also added some of the water to my soup that I had boiled my chicken in but you could add more of the canned chicken stock instead if you like. The flavor was so good that my husband said he'd be happy if I made this soup from now on when we have lots of cucumbers coming off the garden. P.S. He came back for seconds. I think he was as surprised at how good this soup was as I was. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I think the addition of the soup base powder and especially the real chicken bits really made the difference in how flavorful this soup turned out.",
