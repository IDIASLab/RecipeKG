It took a long time to put together and used much more equipment (bowls mixers spatulas sauce pans etc.) than a less complicated recipe might require. That aside it's a mighty fine tart. Note: the recipe doesn't specify this but I used a 9\" tart pan with removable rim about 1.5 inches high. Good thing I did too. A \"normal\" tart pan would have been too shallow given the quantity of filling.",

I didn't have any scotch so I used the last of my brandy about 1 Tbsp. I also beat the egg yolks and sugar with my Kitchenaid rather than on the stove and then mixed in the pumpkin mixture before transferring it to a pan. This would be a great recipe if you're asked to bring a dessert for Thanksgiving; it might be hard to make if you're the one hosting the meal since it has to chill in the fridge and refrigerator space is usually at a premium. I can't wait to try this pumpkin filling in something else say a pumpkin layer cake with a cranberry glaze!",
