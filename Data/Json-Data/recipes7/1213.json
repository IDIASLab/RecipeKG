I also added 1 t almond ex. to both the cherries and the syrup. Let sit in fridge for 5 hrs, covered with much more cinnamon/sugar and omitted the almonds. Baked for 40 mins. It was crispy and lovely on the outside and perfect on the inside. Top with real whipped cream.",

As past reviews have said they were soggy - mine were not AT ALL! I made them not overnight but 5 hours before baking. That may be the difference. They were crispy/chewy like a real pie could be and tasted just like it. I did a couple adjustments one of which I'm very surprised no one else has tried in their reviews that I think is a MUST! I had doubled this recipe for the crowd and I mixed 8 0z of cream cheese with a little (maybe 1/3 cup) powdered sugar. I then spread this on the tortilla before I put the filling on. THIS WAS DElICIOUS! For the filling I followed recommendations and added a little almond extract to the cherry pie filling and I also added one bag of frozen cherries to make them more like real pie and it was a good add-in. I put a little cinnamon (pumpkin pie mix) in too. I had some whole wheat tortillas that I used in half of the batch and they were great as well. I used fresh whipped cream on top and everyone gave rave reviews. I'm not a HUGE cherry pie fan but I will make these again and will try with different fillings. The Wilderness/Comstock brand of filling is preferred - more real tasting.",

Leaving the recipe to soak in hot sugar water overnight is gross - the tortillas are soggy and there is no recovery from that. 5 tortillas in a 13x9\" pan makes no sense but 10\" tortillas won't fit in an 8\" square brownie pan. You also have no need for a whole stick of butter - half is more than enough. If this recipe had been for fajita-sized tortillas in a 8\" pan and the liquid has been less watery and half as much butter it would be a 4 star recipe for me. I had to change way too much to make this recipe worthy of the stars it has and that's disappointing. But I still recommend people try this - just follow the advise of others who have reviewed and learned through trial and error. I'll likely make this again with numerous modifications because it really is easy.",

My kids and husband raved and they could not be easier to put together. I did leave out the nuts because my kids don't like but kept everything else as written. This is such a versatile recipe that any pie filling can be used and the taste will be great. Thanks",
