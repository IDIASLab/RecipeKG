I put it in the oven carefully and it firmed up quite a bit. A couple of changes I think I'd make to the recipe next time - a little more flour in the filling. For me the filling is still a bit too loose. I'd also reduce the sugar as it seems very sweet to me The crust was delicious as it was Update - I stuck these back in the oven and baked them some more.. maybe another 30 minutes. The sugar turned more caramalized and the bars firmed up and browned. I like them MUCH better this way! So if you make these and don't like them bake them more and you might be surprised",
