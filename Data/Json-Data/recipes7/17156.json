The Granny Smith apple is the key ingredient that sets this apart from other slaws of this type.",

The little bit I could get to grate just turned into watery mush so I gave up and cut it into matchsticks instead. I made two different slaw's for taco's last night. Hubs liked the creamier one better but I preferred this one. I used both white and red cabbage to give it more color. I really liked the texture the jicama added. This is a great slaw for tacos!",
