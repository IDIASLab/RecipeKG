Since I'm super busy and caring for a sick mate, I used the bread machine on it's dough cycle (1 hour, 28 minutes) to make the dough and do the first rise. Then took the dough out of machine, formed it and did the rest as Chef John demonstrates. After baking in the oven, I brushed melted butter on sides and bottom and toasted on gas grill because I made foot long buns (don't have a big enough skillet for foot longs). Family loved them. Light, tasty, crisp outside, not at all like a \"regular\" hot dog bun. These smell wonderful. These take a hot dog way beyond an ordinary hot dog. Although Chef John prefers just mustard on his, I dressed these up the Chicago style way. Even added the poppy seeds on half the buns I made (without seeds on the others). Whatever toppings you add to your hot dogs, I think this may be one of those things you have to try before you die.",
