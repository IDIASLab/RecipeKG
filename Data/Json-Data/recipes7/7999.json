By no means a gourmet or exotic side or dessert, but a tasty, easy, and economical salad that is definitely worth trying. Instead of whipped topping I made whipped cream (fresh whipped cream is so easy and much better flavor, texture, and richness compared to whipped topping in a tub. My personal opinion). Seved it with a ham dinner and the sweetness was perfect compliment to the salty ham.",
