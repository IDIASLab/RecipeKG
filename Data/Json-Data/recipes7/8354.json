I believe it is to offset the saltiness of the ham.  The recipe I have calls for 4 egg yolks instead of whole eggs and they are not incorporated until the other ingredients have been blended together and heated up in a double boiler. I wouldn't change the sugar content at all! I am giving it 4 stars due to the egg content. Love this!",

I honestly didn't think this would turn out that great but I was pleasantly surprised. I do recommend cutting back on the sugar though because the tomato soup is pretty sweet itself. I would definitely make this again.",
