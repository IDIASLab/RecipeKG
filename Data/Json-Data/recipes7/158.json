The grocery only had small white flesh peaches so I used 5 of them in place of 3 large. I did as Christina suggested and froze my peach chunks before making the drink thus eliminating the ice cubes. We loved the tartness that the limeade provides in this drink. The skin of the peach adds pretty flecks and color in the glass and added a little texture to the drink. For me c. of spiced rum was a little much. When I make it this summer I will be cutting it back to c. Great selection this week and just in time for the warm summer weather.",

The peach peel that is blended within the drink gives it an appealing appearance. This is a very pleasant tasting drink that I will be making again.",
