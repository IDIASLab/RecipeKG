(For this recipe it would 3 1/3 cup.) The champagne adds great unexpected flavors which I find wonderful. I bought Cook's Brut (medium grade quality) because they come in a 4-pack of small bottles. 1 bottle is little more than 1/2 cup but if you add the entire thing recipe still turns out well. Dry champagnes will say \"Dry\" or \"Extra Dry\" on the label (very little sugar). \"Brut\" is the next step up and still considered dry (with slight sugar); the other kinds weren't available in small bottles.",

That's true for all jelly.  I did that and mine set perfect.",
