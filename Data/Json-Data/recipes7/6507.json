I used unsweetened coconut and maybe the longer thread and sweetened coconut would add some moisture. I had to use a gluten free flour as I was making them for a friend who hadn t have gluten...used Cassava flour which is supposed to be very close to wheat flour. I used a cookie scoop to form them and had to pack the batter into it and carefully transfer it to the sheet. (Like others I used parchment which worked well) after fighting to get the first three cookies onto the sheet in one piece I added another egg white which helped somewhat but still had to be very careful. The baked cookie was very dry and not chewy. I don t like giving a bad rating to a recipe as I know little changes can make a difference but I am disappointed with this recipe.",
