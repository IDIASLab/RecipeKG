                "reviewBody": "This soup was yummy overall. However several things I would change: 1 - The recipe doesn't specify when to add oil so I added it at the beginning with the butter. 2 - Soup didn't taste salty enough so added a bit of salt 3 - I would recommend cooking the onions/apples portion for a good 8 hours and then adding the liquids and cooking for a good four hours. I cooked the liquids for 1 1/2 hours as outlined in the recipe and the flavors didn't really get to meld. However the next day I heated up some leftovers and it was really yummy. So I think the liquids just need to be cooked longer so the flavors all blend together. 4 - Lastly I used Vidalia onions in this recipe but I think next time I'll try red onions. Red onions would compliment the flavor of the apples very well I think. I also might try using golden delicious apples instead of granny smiths. They added a bit too much tartness to the soup. Overall a great unique recipe that I will definitely make again!",

                "reviewBody": "I give the original recipe three stars because of the chicken broth. Onion and apple marry well with beef broth especially if one calls this French Onion Soup fall twist or not. I made it with beef broth cut the apple cider to 3/4 cup and used gala apples so as not to make this too tart. I seasoned the onion/apple mixture with 1 1/2 tsp. of sea salt and fresh ground pepper. I also added a tablespoon of flour to the apple and onion mixture 30 minutes before adding the liquids. I think the brandy was nice but next time I'll use something that doesn't reduce to such a sweet flavor like a dark and smoky cabernet. I also omitted the sugar from the bread all together as I felt this would be too sweet and overpowering to the savory flavors of this soup. I also used a mixture of gruyere and gouda. With these small tweaks this is a 4 1/2 star recipe.",

I cooked the onions (4 large)in a stick of butter over med-high heat for about 10 minutes then I added the brandy let it cook down a minute and added 2 tbsp of flour.

Also I didn't have brandy so I used Sam Adams Utopias which has a smoky flavor similar to cognac. I topped the soup with the cheese and let it melt--delicious!",
