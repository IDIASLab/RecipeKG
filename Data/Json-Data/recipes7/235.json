I had a little trouble with the graham crackers. When I put them in whole they made the churn bind up and the crackers didn't break up. The next time I made it I put in graham cracker crumbs. That worked better but the taste of the crackers was rather diluted. Next time - and there will definitely be a next time - I will add broken up crackers near the end of the churn process. Very refreshing for a hot summer day!",
