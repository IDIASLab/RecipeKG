The lemon juice is necessary not only to prevent browing, but also to prevent the cell walls of the peaches from breaking down when cooking.  The peaches will have much better identity and structure if you add the lemon or lime jiuce.  I placed a colander in a work bowl and added the peaches.  Then I poured lime juice over the peaches and gently tossed the fruit.  This way, the excess lime juice fell to the bottom.  I then tossed the drained peaches with the dry mixture in another bowl.  The pie was perfect and the peaches were firm and not mushy.    It also removed any juices that would have made the pie runny.  The lime jiuce blends much better with the peach flavor.",

It will only add a few more minutes to your prep time, and it's SO worth it (search Mom's Pie Crust for a simple, old-fashioned recipe).  I also sometimes make this pie with 3 C peaches, 2 C blueberries, but you can really make it with any fruit combination.  Just make sure to adjust the sugar accordingly if you use something sour. It's a winner, and if you decorate it with a nice lattice top homemade crust, people will beg at your feet for more of this pie. ",

I used half the amount of lemon juice and added 1/4 tsp vanilla and tossed the peaches in a coriander letting them drain as others suggested.  I omitted the nutmeg and instead used ginger.  I also used a pinch more cinnamon.  I used half what it called for white sugar and instead substituted that with brown sugar.  I also did the same with the flour - I only used 1/2 what the recipe called for and instead substituted the other 1/2 with cornstarch.  I egg washed the crust and sprinkled with sugar in the raw.  The pie came out delicious.  It was messy to eat while still warm, but my husband had a slice this morning (yes, this morning) out of the refrigerater and it was perfect.  Oh...I also followed the tip for turning off the oven and leaving the pie in for another 10 minutes.",

I would suggest adding 2Tbsp of cornstarch and use only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  When it says to brush with egg, only use the egg whites not the yolk.  We don't brush the bottom crust, we just poor filling directly in add top shell, brush W/egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mix.  Bake as 45 min on bottom rack at 350, if top crust is not brown and golden, bake until it is.  After finished baking,take out of oven, let it COMPLETELY cool, cover and   Let stand at room temp over night. cut the next day. you will have perfect beautiful slices and it will taste awesome too!!",

Make sure you cool if for at least 2 hours before cutting. This will really ensure that the pie stays together. This will be my new standard summer recipe. You will love it.",
