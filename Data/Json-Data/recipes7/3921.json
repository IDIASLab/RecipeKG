Now my 78 year father-in-law bugs my hubby when there are no watermelon pops in the freezer! Go figure! To those that had difficulty with \"floating\" try again. Making anything with Jello is not art it is SCIENCE! A few tips to make it a QUICK and EASY dessert. Put three bowls out with 1/3 cup sugar in each. Have 2 measuring cups with 1/2 c. each cold water ready. To Bowl A: add strawberry jello. To Bowl B: add lime jello. To Bowl C: add cream cheese. Bowl A & B - add boiling water and stir until dissolved. Put three ice cubes into each measuring cup of cold water. Add ice water to Bowl A & B. Stir until ice is melted. Stick Bowl B in FREEZER. Have eight 6 oz Dora the Explorer paper cups ready! (Hubby thinks they're too cute). Now add 1/8 cup red jello (Bowl A) to each cup. You might have to level a little between the cups. Stick in freezer for at least 20 minutes. Pull cups out. Pull green jello out stir and put in FRIDGE. Mix choco chips into red jello with plastic spoon. Mix up the sugar and cheese in Bowl C. and fold in whipped topping. Add couple of tablespoons of cheese mixture to each cup. Turn the cup as you push down the cheese with a small plastic spoon. This will make a tight and even layer. Put spoons in each. Grab green jello and finish off the pops. With 6 oz. cups this will take a minimum of 5 hours to freeze. 15 min to assmbl.",

                "reviewBody": "These were a huge hit with my family! I read the reviews before making them so I tried both ways with the choc. chips. I did some putting the chips in the strawberry jello before freezing (all the chips sink to the bottom of the cup so they will be in the top of the pop.) The rest I made according to the recipe - putting the choc. chips in after freezing the strawberry layer. I prefer this method - but I did stir the chips in and then used a bamboo skewer to move them around and push them toward the outside of the cup. If you put them in during this step they will be in different levels of the strawberry jello. To avoid \"floaties\" be sure to make the lime jello first and make sure it has slightly congealed (not pourable but has to be spooned on top) before putting it on top of the cream cheese layer. This way the cream cheese cannot \"float\" into that layer. The kids and adults alike loved the taste and I'm making them again for our cookout tomorrow!",

I used plastic cups because I did not have paper cups and it worked fine. When taking out of the freezer to serve roll these between your hands and push up on the bottom of the cup and they slide right out. I wish these recipes would tell you how much of everything to put in the cups so here is what I did. I used approximately 2 and a half Tbsp. of red jello mix in the bottom of the cups. I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes and then stirred in the chocolate chips. I then used approximately 2 Tbsp. of the cream cheese cool whip mix and used a teaspoon to spread it in the cups.
