This is a base recipe and designed to add dried fruit and nuts.  The recipe where I added 3 T of coconut flour came out  crumbly, I felt it was too dry.  The recipe where I followed the directions came out more cake like and held together well.  Both recipes I added dried fruit (cranberries, cherries) and seeds.  I did bump up the spices to 1T.  I made this with both dairy and with coconut milk.   Key to get a great bar that holds together is to let  ingredients sit to absorb moisture.  Doubles just fine.",

You may want to  increase the amount of spice and flavorings or else the finished flavor is a bit bland.  It is important to let the complete mixture soak before baking.  This allows the oats to absorb the liquid and soften. Baked in a parchment paper lined dish, with paper hanging over the edge.  After 30 min baking, removed the parchment paper with the bars and placed the parchment with the bars back on a wire oven rack to cook and additional  5 min.  Removed from the oven and gently sliced. Placed the slices back in the oven on a tray to cook for an additional 5 min to dry some and brown on all 4 sides of each bar.  Much like you would do for baking biscotti. Added additions of peanut butter powder, fine unsweetened coconut, and sliced almonds, as well as the recipe's cinnamon and vanilla.  Used only 1/4 C dark brown sugar and it turned out with with just a hint of sweetness....Personal preference.  Very nice recipe plain or for the addition of different enhancing ingredients.  Thanks!",

If more taste is desired, consider adding in ingredients with strong flavor like cranberries.  \n\nAs is, they do have a pleasant oatmeal flavor with just a touch or cinnamon, but I think the next time I am going to try some add ins.  I am going to try it with some peanut butter for added protein.   Another idea is Nutella for all the chocolate lovers.  Actually the possibilities are endless.  I think it would be good just using various grains and nuts.  \n\nAll in all, this was pretty quick to make and did not make a huge mess.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I will definitely make it again.",
