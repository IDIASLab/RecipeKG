These are my changes:  I always add a couple of dashes of cinnamon to the batter for a better color and zip.  I add more sugar because I like a sweeter dough.  We love the streusel topping, so I always make way more of that and also put walnuts or pecans in.  Finally, these are GREAT as mini-muffins or regular muffins. They look spectacular but only take a couple of minutes to make.",

Instead of using soy milk I used 2/3 cup of sugar free vanilla coffee creamer and 1/4 cup of regular milk. I also added 1 Tbl of vanilla for more flavor.
