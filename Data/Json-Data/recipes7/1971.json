                "reviewBody": "THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! The most important ideas/comments/notes are: 1. The dressing IS incredible! I've been looking for the perfect lemon tahini dressing ever since I ate at Mountain Oasis in Flagstaff Arizona and this one is a close second! I doubled it and saved the rest for a simple green salad the next day. 2. I added about a cup of thinly sliced jicama to add another color flavor and crunch to this dish. I'm considering a beet as well for next time. 3. I used the feta as an optional topping. I used one dish of plain feta and one with a mixture of the feta and dill (I omitted the dill from the raw recipe). 4. Leaving the mixture in the fridge for a couple of hours does help the flavors blend better than serving it right away. 5. A pinch of celery salt is nice to add as well upon serving. 6. Next time I'm going to toast some pecans with some sugar and cayenne to add as another optional topping. To toast: Make sure all nuts are coated with butter before sprinkling the sugar and cayenne (VERY LITTLE cayenne goes a long way!). Spread them in a single layer at 375 degrees for 10-15 minutes (until you can smell them... mmmmm!). 7. This recipe still deserves five stars even though I tweaked it a little! It's nice and simple and tasty!",

(If you intend to keep it over night don't add the cheese until you are ready to serve individual portions as it will start to run when it mixes witht the dressing.) The cabbage was just too crisp the first time around after it had a chance to soften up in the fridge overnight and mingle with the dressing it was just right. It might have helped if I had sliced the cabbage a little thinner....but I tried to keep it about the same size as the asparagus. I doubled the amount of the dressing because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Tahini! The dressing is very good; I plan to use it as a topping for other salads in the future. The dill...I'm still undecided about; which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I'm not a huge dill fan but that's just me. I think mint might be an interesting option we'll see next time as I plan to make this again. Very simple colorful and tasty salad!!",

Later on I thought it needed a little something, so I added about 2 Tbsp of mayo and 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar.  That was much better.  I didn't add the dill because I didn't think it was a good dish for dill and I subsituted sliced almonds for the pine nuts.  Before serving I cooked the asparagus and added that along with the feta cheese.  Other than that, the only other addition I made was chicken.  I grilled two marinaded chicken breasts and then thinly sliced them (still warm) onto the salad.  So good.  My husband loved it.  Next time we decided we're going to try adding some golden raisins and bleu cheese intead of feta.",
