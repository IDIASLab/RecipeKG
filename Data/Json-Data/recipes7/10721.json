I also used a thinner kind of glass noodles than the Korean dang nyun, because these were the ingredients I had on hand. I also used a special soy sauce that had mirin in it. I simplified the steps 3 to 6 by sauteeing the ingredients in the wok, in this order: onions, then beef, then as the beef cooked, julienned carrots, then bok choy (which I had blanched, not boiled). I poured all the sauce in Step 1 onto the noodles, and tossed it to coat evenly. I didn't mix in the veggies and beef, but used them instead as topping. It was delicious! And it tasted so much like the Chap Chae at a favorite restaurant. But I am adding dang nyun to my shopping list, because I plan to cook this again soon!",
