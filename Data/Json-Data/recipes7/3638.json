I baked the biscuits in muffin tins and they came out perfectly round. I baked for exactly 11 min, and the insides were just slightly soft, perfect & moist.  The top did crumble a bit when I sliced them warm, but once the berries & cream were added, you couldn't tell the difference, although I did try these without slicing, still very good.  To enhance the flavouring of the strawberries, add as much as 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 1/2 cup of sugar (or splenda) to the strawberries, mix well and allow to sit for as long as possible (10 min or up to a couple of hours). Really good...",

This met my expectations exactly!:) As with any recipe I have a few suggestions for improvement. The next time I make these (there WILL be a next time!) I will substitute heavy whipping cream for milk (for richness) and add a bit of vanilla (to enhance the overall flavor) as others have suggested. I baked my shortcakes for 11 minutes but feel they would have been fine at the 9 minute mark. After sititng for 10 minutes these split beautifully (i.e. no crumbles!). NOTE: My grocery store only had 2 lb. containers of strawberries. This recipe instructs to add 1/2 c. sugar to a quart of strawberries. There are approximately 1.5 lbs. of strawberries in a quart (this conversion ONLY applies to strawberries; with any other ingredient you cannot convert from pounds to quarts). I added 3/4 c. sugar to mine with great results. Filled with the delicious strawberry mixture and Cool-whip this was really a great treat - and my guests couldn't have agreed more. Thanks!",
