So rather than Port Wine I used that instead. Also I had only 3 1/2 cups of wine so I changed from 40 to 35 servings and used 1.75 oz of dry pectin. The color was beautiful and the taste was incredible. Next time (probably next year) I will use port because this tasted great and was fun to make with my daughter. Also with my serving adjustment I still made a total of 5 jelly jars.",

Pectin requires a certain ratio of acid to sugar. Port doesn't have enough acid so adding the lemon juice should help it to set up better. If your using a white wine you can probably skip the lemon juice since white wine has more acid than port. \n\nAlso, be prepared with more jars- the yield on this recipe is also incorrect - my port \"sauce\" following instructions exactly yielded 8 half pints",
