When I make this again I will double the lemon mixture. The cream cheese mixture is super thick and creamy so it can definitely stand the larger lemon amount. Very excited to have found a lemon bar recipe that's a little different from the rest. I think I will also try it with Key lime juice. I think this would be beautiful for a wedding or baby shower.",

I only topped it because I liked the more finished look.  These were a hit with our family and friends.  Great refreshing summer dessert w/o instant pudding or cool whip!
