The recipe made five Oui yogurt containers of pudding, which at 1-2 tsp each of graham cracker crumbs probably equals 1/3 cup.  The rest was not wasted--I added it on top!  I did not have yogurt, so substituted sour cream with a Tblsp of sugar, and it was great!  My husband especially liked it because it was not too sweet.  He also thought there could be more lime juice (I used persian limes).  Yum!  It would be even better with flavored yogurt!",

I didn't have the shooter glasses and used mini goblets so the layers weren t as prominent but still visible and attractive. I only needed half the amount of crumbs. Using the zip lock bags is a great tip and one I utilized. This made a delightful dessert for a hot day when I didn t want to crank up the oven.",
