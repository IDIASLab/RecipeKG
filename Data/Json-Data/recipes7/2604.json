Melt it in a pan with butter. careful not to burn and spead it on top. The unsweeten chips will break up the sweetness of the cake a bit so its not so overwhelming and it will stay on top and look pretty. ",

Actually it tasted great (hence the 4 stars) but it looked like... well not good. When I put the icing on it just was absorbed by the cake. If it was supposed to that then great! But it looked pretty miserable. I made it for my daughter's school - I was supposed to bring something South American. Most was gone before I left but I figure it didn't look appetizing. It was really moist and easy to make though. Like I said I will update when/if I try it again.",

I didn't want a huge amount of cake around the house - so I cut the measurements by half and used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 pan. I also added a couple of shakes of pumpkin pie spice and a dash of vanilla and a sprinkling of corriander. The only hot chocolate mix I had in the house was a blend called \"Mayan\" which means there was a bit of cinnamon and other spice to it. It turned out GREAT! I loved the gooeyness of the soaked in icing. I will use this recipe again as a base and I think the next time I will throw in some raisins and nuts and make a cream cheese glaze. Even though I think it is more than likely fantastic made just as ordered in the recipe - my experimentation leads me to think you could do all sorts of things to this recipe to change it up - very versatile. The texture is moist and rich and it is just DELICIOUS!",

Melt 4 tablespoons of instant chocolate in 1 tablespoon of butter. Let it cool and once it's room temperature mix in the table cream. Pour it over the fresh-out-of-the-oven cake, let it cool and set, and it's done! I personally like to make my cake in round pans so that it drizzles on the side!
