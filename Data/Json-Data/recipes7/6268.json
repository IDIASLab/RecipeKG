As for the cheese use HALF. (4oz cream cheese 1/3 cup sugar). Just sprinkle the pecans on each. I didn't even use all the topping I had about 1-2 T of it leftover. I also baked mine for 30 min. I let them cool in the pan for 10 min before removing. I hope this helps. Sorry about the incorrect amounts!",
