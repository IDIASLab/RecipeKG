All ingredients partner well with each other, and the pudding is very creamy.  Next time, I\u2019ll try this recipe with lime zest which I think will give it a totally different and bolder flavor profile.  Wouldn\u2019t hesitate to serve this to company.  Enjoyed chilled, garnished with toasted coconut and a sprig of mint and served with toasted coconut thin cookies (from Trader Joe\u2019s).",
