I didn't use the food processor to grind up the figs and pine nuts just cause I didn't have one available to me...but I think that it gave it a great textural element. Next time I might toast the nuts prior to combining them with the figs. Thank you Laura for sharing this recipe; this was a great way to end our Italian feast.",

Definitely would roast the pine nuts in the future but the nut-fig filling on the nectarines (yes I used nectarines not peaches) was very good. Super simple to make with nice presentation actually a little elegant in its simplicity.",
