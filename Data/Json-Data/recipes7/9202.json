Tin foil loaf pans from the grocery store tend to bake the most beautiful quick breads (at least for me) so I used three 8\" x 3.75\" pans. I prepped each one with a light coating of baking spray and filled them one-third full. To my surprise they raised like they should high in the center and golden around the edges. This recipe delivers a great punch of flavors and perfect texture. You won't be sorry on this one!",
