I use the largest cukes I can find and use the full tablespoon of sea salt because \"water follows salt\" (think \"Osmosis\").  Adding salt to cukes, zucchini, etc. will help dry them out. You most certainly can decrease the amount to suit your taste but as the majority of reviewers mentioned: you MUST drain the cukes thoroughly or you'll end up with a runny mess. I like the idea of using a salad spinner (an item I don't have) but I have to rely on time and patience when I make this (or squeezing by hand if I'm in a hurry and they're still too wet after 30 minutes). I'm glad that most of you have enjoyed this recipe, and I also enjoyed seeing some of the twists on it.",

I put mine in a salad spinner, which automatically caused a separation between the cucumbers and the brine.  I also waited the full 30 minutes indicated.  I also added a sprig of fresh tarragon that I chopped up and it added an amazing flavor.  I made it a bit last minute so I wasn't able to keep it in the refrigerator the full two hours, but it tasted great after cooling for 45 minutes. The incredible thing about this salad is how crispy the cucumber remained, even the left overs we ate the next day..  I've made it twice already; my husband loves it.",
