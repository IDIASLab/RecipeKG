I tried following the directions, but I'm not sure that cacciatore is supposed to fall apart like that. Perhaps six hours is too long? It was more like a pulled pork than a traditional cacciatore. With chicken or rabbit, you generally have distinct pieces of the animal to serve. But it does hold up to its title of being melt in your mouth! I have a tone of leftovers, but it will go quickly because it is that good. I served this with pasta rather than the suggested mashed potatoes, but I can see how it would be good partnered with mash.",

I  cut the roast into bite sized peices and dredged them in flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I browned the beef in olive oil, removed it from the pot  and sauteed the veggies in the same pot.  Once the veggies were tender, I added the wine and cooked it down for a few minutes.  Then I added the beef back in along with the remaining ingredients.  I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper and I used beef broth instead of water.  I simmered it for two hours.  I served it over egg noodles.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this again!",

I loved it!  \n     However, I wanted the sauce to be a little thicker so I did add 6 oz of tomato paste.  Also, I love black olives, so just for my own preference I added them.   Regardless, it was good prior to my additions.  Tried it with mashed potatoes, as suggested, which is great for a no-carb meal.  Then, served it to my family using egg noodles, good reviews had by all.  This is going in my \"special\" recipe book.  I will be making this again and again!\n     It makes a lot.  It would be great as a Sunday meal with family and friends.  My family is small (4) so I would half the recipe.  It's all good, I'm sharing what I made with others and I froze some for another day.  \n     Thank you for sharing:)",
