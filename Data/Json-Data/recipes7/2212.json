Some things to note- you should stir the rice once or twice while it's cooking so it absorbs all the coconut milk or else it will burn around the edges. Don't cook the chicken until it \"browns\" it will be overdone. The dish is very colorless... I would recommend adding some red pepper flakes cashews a lime twist and/or even cilantro. I really liked the coconut rice. YUM! Also I would recommend marinating the chicken longer than 20 min for it to soak up that good flavor. I will try this again with those changes.",

If you eat the rice alone it's a little bland (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). I used brown rice as usual and just cooked twice as long. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested stirring the rice a few times during cooking. I think mine would have burned otherwise. The amount of lime was perfect- I would have been good with even more. I added a sprinkle of salt to the chicken as it was marinating. My kids loved the chicken- they both asked for seconds! They didn't like the rice though. We had this with plain broccoli.",
