The flavor and creaminess are simply unsurpassed.  \n\nBy the way, for easiest prep, I did all of Step 1 in the morning and refrigerated.  In the evening, I started with Step 2 and dinner was on the table (along with grilled cheese sandwiches) in about 15 minutes.  At this point, I was dealing with cold soup, so blending was not nerve-wracking.  I'll be making this often!",
