I usually throw in a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes. They dissolve completely  during cooking, and add an additional layer of goodness, as well as making the sauce a bit thicker if you want a quicker sauce. The hamburger makes it a more hardy pasta meal.  Add a salad and some good bread and you're good to go. :)",
