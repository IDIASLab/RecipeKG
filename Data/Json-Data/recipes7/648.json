I did make a few tweeks added some lemon juice seasoned rice vinegar a little bit of garlic infused and oil and two cloves of garlic. I put it all in my mini food processor and used about a 1/4 of it for the sautee-ing then added the rest right before serving. Next time I would add cornstarch or the like to thicken the sauce up because it was DELICIOUS!!!! I will make again and again especially with the mushrooms asparagus and scallions perfect combo!",
