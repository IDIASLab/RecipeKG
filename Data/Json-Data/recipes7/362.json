As a personal preference I replaced the peanuts with toasted cashews- toasting the nuts is a must or the flavour is lost. I loved how low-calorie the dressing is but I found the fresh mint and cilantro quite over-powering when left in the dressing. I recommend straining out the herbs after allowing the flavours to mingle. I also added chopped sugar snap peas and baby spinach to add variety to the veggies.",
