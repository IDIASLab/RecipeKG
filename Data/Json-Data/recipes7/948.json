I had a few as regular dumplings like the recipe calls for, but I premade these for later in the evening. After boiling them, I put them on a cookie sheet lined with reynolds non stick foil and popped them in the fridge. When we were about 15 minutes from dinner being served I put a tsp of sesame oil in a  non stick frying pan and cooked them about a minute or so on each side. This warmed them up and voila instant potsticker. The other thing I did that made this so easy was to use a small bag of coleslaw mix instead of messing with so much grating. This also had the purple cabbage bits in it and made it very colorful. I did also add a bit more soy sauce and a little dribble of balsamic vinegar. Then just let it all steam until soggy. Beware this makes a ton. I used a package of wrappers that had 60 in it and still had a heaping cereal bowl of filling. People went nuts for them though and nothing was left after about an hour, as some came back for seconds and thirds. I will definately be making this again.",

I did think that the filling was a little bland I might use 1/2 ground pork next time or add some extra seasoning.

Tips for perfect wontons:  Use mixture of water and soy sauce to moisten the wrappers before fillings -- the tops stick together better. I also make a teriyaki sauce, submitted by LINDSXLT4X4, to dip these in.  \"A great homemade teriyaki for this dish is 1 T. cornstarch, 1 T. cold water, 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. cider vingar, 1 clove minced garlic, a dash each of ground ginger and ground black pepper (according to taste). Simmer all together, stirring regularly til thickened.\"  I'm telling you -- AWESOME! ",
