                "reviewBody": "Hi.  I am the recipe submitter.  If you like butternut squash these fries are excellent and are ZERO Weight Watcher PPTS!  Butternut squash has more moisture than potatoes.  So here are a few tips for handling that.  First, it is important to blot out as much moisture as possible before cooking.  Also, if you are looking for crispier fries, try cutting them thinner.  As another reviewer mentioned, spray not only the baking sheet but the fries with cooking spray.  If the fries are large enough, you can place them on a baking rack on top of the baking pan so the air can circulate beneath them and that will also help crisp the fries.  Lastly, if they are not crisp enough you can bake them a little longer.  With regard to the seasoning I use a homemade cajun seasoning without salt.  Then I can control how much salt is added.  Different brands of cajun seasoning have different amounts of salt and therefore you may prefer to either adjust the amount of salt or leave it out altogether.  I hope these tips are helpful; and I hope you enjoy the recipe.",

Have cooked these a couple times now and this is a keeper. They are delectable!",

A few tips though:\n\n1) 1 lb of squash may sound like a lot...but after peeling it, seeding it, and cooking it...you're left with maybe 5 ounces left. Luckily it's just me and I ate them all. Definitely need more next time though :)\n2) It says 15-20 minutes but I'm thinking more 20-25.\n3) Listen to the others when they say to cut them thin. Shoestring thin.\n4) A nice quick spray of oil lets the seasoning stick (I used Old Bay Seasoning and it was fantastic).\n5) Definitely let them air out to get some moisture out (I sandwiched mine between paper towels and cookie sheets, then weighed them down).\n\nAll in all...great. I'm gonna try them again this weekend. Chalk this up as a fantastic item for those of us trying to lose weight.",
