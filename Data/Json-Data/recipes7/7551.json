I will probably add more chocolate chips next time, but I love chocolate chips.",

I think it was due to the sugar you get from the chocolate chips. Next time I may even substitute the chocolate chips for apple because I think that would be a god combination with the pecans and cinnamon...or maybe a combination of white chocolate chips and apple?

If it\u2019s too dry, you cooked it either too hot and for too long. To avoid that, we tend to undercook it a bit.  Also, extra topping is very nice, especially if it gets crunchy along the sides. BTW, it does not work well with fat free cream cheese.  But it does work well with extra chocolate chips ??",
