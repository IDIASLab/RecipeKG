        "description": "I don't always make pancakes, but when I do, I prefer kefir chocolate chip pancakes. I love traditional pancakes, but kefir gives these an extra dimension of fullness. When making these pancakes, I also highly recommend experimenting with various flavored kefirs, such as strawberry or pomegranate. I don't think of pancakes as healthy in general, but this recipe calls for only 2 teaspoons of sugar. If you include chocolate chips, you don't even need to use maple syrup. Enjoy some orange juice or a coffee with these.",

This is a great buttermilk pancake alternative that doesn't contain additional milk or butter. These are lighter and fluffier than the pancakes we used to make with milk. And WAY better than using Almond Milk! Next time I may add a small amount of Vanilla or Almond Extract for a subtle flavor.",
