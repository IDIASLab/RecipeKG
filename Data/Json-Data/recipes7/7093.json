Bite size pieces are certainly necessary with this type of lettuce because kale has so much substance. Flavor seemed mile to me but the ruffle of the leaves and the firmness of it all certainly created a salad that made you recognize this was roughage. I think this would be just as tasty served like a spinach salad with strawberries and almonds or a chinese chicken salad and just substituting the kale.",

To do this, remove the stems, put a little olive oil on your hands, and knead the kale like you would bread for about 5 minutes, or until it is a dark rich green.  It's amazing how this changed the flavor.  I tried the dressing, reducing the lemon as suggested to 1/4 of a cup, but this was still to tangy for my taste buds, so I ended up not using it at all.  I made the dressing I make for spinach and strawberry salad, and it was great!  My 14 year old loved it as well.  I will definitely massage my kale in the future!",

If you want to keep the nutrients and keep it a 'raw' salad you can 'massage' the kale for 2-3 minutes (google; massaged kale salad). This squeezing technique breaks down the toughness and bitterness making it much more soft and palatable. Enjoy!",
