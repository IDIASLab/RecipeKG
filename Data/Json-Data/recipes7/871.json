I made mine ahead for a BBQ but found that the liquid from the marinating vegetables really watered down the dressing so it hardly had any taste. I then doubled the dressing amounts added 1/2 teaspoon celery seed and black pepper and added a bit more cabbage. It was better but I can't say it has become a favourite. If I give it a second chance I think I'll use red onions to add to the colour of the dish (its appearance was better than its taste).",
