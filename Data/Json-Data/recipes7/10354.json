Just a couple of key items: 1) I don't know if this assumed to be obvious but the dough intructions don't say anything about the water needed. I added just enough cold water to have a workable non-sticky dough. Also I chopped the butter for a better flaky crust. 2.) The cream cheese mixture didn't quite hold while I added the pumpkin layer. It became more marbled than anything. Still tasted great but perhaps handmixing cheese mix would prevent it from getting so soft.",

The cream cheese mixture made this somewhat like cheesecake but I think since it wasn't combined it lacked the true taste of cheesecake... pumpkin or no. Now I used a smaller pan which may have something to do with this but the top got a little burnt around the edges and the crust was a bit thick and dry. I'm sad to say I would not make again... although it tasted good enough it wasn't pumpkin cheesecake and I can make pie/custard any day. A note though; it was much better after sitting in the fridge overnight like the chief said and tasted more like cheesecake although the crust was still too thick.",
