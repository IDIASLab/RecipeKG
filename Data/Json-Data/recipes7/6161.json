The cinnamon/nutmeg and the coconut made this the best recipe for butterscotch chip cookies I've ever tasted! They also didn't fall the first time like so many cookie recipes that I make at such high altitude. I usually bake a few cookies and then make some changes for the altitude but these were perfectly raised and lightly browned on the top! I had run out of brown sugar so I almost didn't make the cookies but used all white and added a TBLS of dark honey. I also only had 1 cup of butter (okay so my cupboards are bare!) and I like a few less oats so I put in 1/2 cup less oats and added a 1/2 cup flour instead. Perfect!",
