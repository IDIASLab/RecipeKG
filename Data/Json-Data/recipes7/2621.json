I used only 1 tsp. of almond extract. Because I added more wet ingredients the batter was very sticky so I dropped the batter onto the cookie sheet in 12 equal portions and topped it with cinnamon sugar and chopped walnuts (didn't have any almonds).They were perfect! Light moist and flavorful! Just what I wanted! Great recipe!",

The dough was sticky and more like a batter than a dough. Sticky messy and a pain to try to knead. I know the kneading is supposed to be minimal but because of the stickiness I had to keep adding flour. I noticed others reviews stated numerous substitutions they made and the finished product turned out well. I kept to the recipe and made no substitutions. Won't use this recipe again.
