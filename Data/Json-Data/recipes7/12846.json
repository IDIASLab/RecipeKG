I have never had peach cobbler, so wasn't sure what to expect...but it's like an apple pie (with peaches instead of apples) & the topping is like a muffin!  Very good!  We ate it the day after I made it, so I just microwaved each piece for 30 seconds before we enjoyed it!  Will make again :)  Thanks for a yummy recipe!",

After I made it the first time I customized it to my family's taste buds so the second time for us I added 3/4 c sugar and 1/2 tsp salt to the batter plus I found the batter a touch thin so I also added 2 tablespoons of additional flour. I didn't add the water to the filling as my peaches were quite juicy but I upped the flour in the filling to 2 tablespoons. Thank you for a great recipe.",
