No more Kozy Shack for my hubby's lunch...here's my few modifications...1 and 3/4 cup cold cooked Jasmine rice and I kept everything else the same.  One thing I did that may help you..I mixed together the remaining 1/2 cup milk, the sugar and the egg together in a pourable mixing bowl.  When the timing was right, I stirred the pudding with my right hand while slowly pouring the egg/milk/sugar mixture into the pudding with my left hand.  I had no trouble with cooked egg pieces.  Also, it only took about 10 minutes for the rice to get thick - don't cook it too long or it won't be creamy.  I grated fresh nutmeg and cinnamon on top.  Very good!",

Rice being a grain gets its best flavor from salt. I add a little at a time throughout the cooking until it is no longer bland as one cook mentioned. Sweet and salt is the best. No matter how much milk you add it can be cooked down to give you a very creamy product. Make sure you temper the egg by adding a bit of the hot mixture in the beaten egg until it comes closer to the hot pudding and whisk in a little at a time. Done this way, you will not end up with soup, but will spend more time cooking.  Be patient.",

I didn't alter the other ingredients, just the milk & in ratio to the amount of rice I had to use.  I was very pleased with the subsequent results, it tastes just like my regular rice pudding recipe, which is concocted over a double boiler.  Will definitely make this again when I have leftover rice, which is actually pretty often.  Thanks for sharing!",

Yet  - I've made this several times and am happy with how it turns out. Be careful when adding egg to the hot rice mixture -you need to temper the egg by adding a little bit of the hot liquid to the egg (and milk and sugar) and stir - and add more hot rice mixture and stir then add egg mixture to the rest of the rice and mix. This gently heats up the egg so you don't end up with scrambled egg in your rice pudding.",
