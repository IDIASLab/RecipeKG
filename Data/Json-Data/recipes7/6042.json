They are sweet enough but not sweet like pralines. They were very easy to make with ingredients already in my pantry. No trip to the store necessary. I don't bake very often but these are worth baking. I made the recipe as written except I used margarine instead of butter since that is what I had on hand. I used a tablespoon to drop the dough on the cookie sheet but these made much larger cookies than what I expected. I set out to make 24 and it made about 18. But they were delicious! These would be awesome if they were dipped in chocolate! Thanks for a great cookie recipe.",
