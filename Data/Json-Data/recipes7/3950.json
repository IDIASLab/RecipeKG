Sometimes these are not very sweet so I defrosted them by soaking them in a cup of mango fruit juice to make sure they had plenty of sweetness and flavor and added the mango and juice to the salsa. Followed the recipe for everything else and the salsa was amazing! Oh I did add extra tomato. Good to know that frozen mango can be used in a pinch. The second night we had this I mixed diced avocado into it and that was great too! Thanks for a terrific salsa recipe! My husband hasn't stopped talking about it!",
