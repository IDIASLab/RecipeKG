I did not have a dish suitable for such a large flan so I just used smaller dishes/ramekins. It took 45 minutes for the white sugar to melt into caramel and once it hit the bottom of the dish it immediately solidified so there was no spreading...that was my first concern. I refrigerated these for several hours and tried unmolding a couple for dessert last night. This was disastrous because it did not come out in one piece. Next I thought I'd ruined the dishes because I couldn't get the caramel out. Bottom line I think this really needs to be refrigerated overnight because I flipped one onto a plate today and it popped out with caramel pooling beautifully around the flan. I think the overnight refrigeration allows the caramel to melt. After soaking in some water overnight the dishes cleaned up just fine and the one from this morning went right into the dishwasher. Don't skip the toasted coconut as I think it really finalizes the pina colada theme. The flan texture is a little different but this is absolutely delicious and the best flan I've ever had! Sorry for the long review but I wanted to explain what transpired in preparing this wonderful dessert. Thanks Leticia.",

                "reviewBody": "Thought this was a fun recipe - and surprised that it actually turned out for me without any difficulty! I had a bottle of pina colada mixer left over from a punch-making event so used the whole 33 ounces of it for the sweetened cream of coconut and it worked out okay. The recipe made 10 fairly good sized individual servings (maybe 3/4 cup to 1 cup per pyrex dish) and it took about a whole hour to cook as recipe described even for the 10 little dishes instead of one single large dish. I was delighted that the smaller dishes cooled a lot sooner than I expected so that I was actually able to serve them immediately after dinner even though I put them in the fridge just as everyone arrived. Unfortunately we had unexpected additional guests so my husband and I didn't get to sample the dessert. I heard one person say it was \"pretty sweet\" but everyone cleaned their plates so I'm guessing that they enjoyed it. One suggestion if you use several small dishes - rotate the pan in the oven so that the corner dishes in the front end up in the back so that they all get a chance to cook fairly evenly. The ones in the back of the oven when I cooked them got done sooner than the ones in the front. You'll know when they're close to being done - the tops of them turn golden brown.",
