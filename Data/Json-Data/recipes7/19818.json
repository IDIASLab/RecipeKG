I didn't have vanilla-flavored soy milk, just plain (unflavored) soy milk, so I used that instead and just added a little more vanilla extract. My husband really liked it, but he felt like there was too much walnut. Personally, I liked the strong walnut flavor but if you don't, I suggest cutting back on the walnut. Also, I suggest chilling the dough before you bake. I didn't to save time, and the dough was really sticky and difficult to work with. Not a big deal, but just a minor annoyance.",
