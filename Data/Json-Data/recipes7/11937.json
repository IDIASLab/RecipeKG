I doubled the recipe and had 6 pints afterwards.  Here are the canning details...\nWhile the blueberries boil in the sugar, place canning kids in a water bath and bring to a boil.  This softens the seal and allows it to stick.  When blueberries are finished boiling and thickening, fill with hot blueberries to the bottom of  the rim where the lid screws on.  Wipe the mouth of the jar with a clean, wet cloth (I used a clean paper towel).  It is okay to leave a little wet you just do not want to leave any jam bits that may interfere with the seal.  Use a fork to get a lid out of the hot water and finger tighten (not too tight but on good).  Next invert onto a kitchen towel and allow to cool.  When cool, turn right side up.  Check seal by pressing in on the middle of each jar.  If sealed, it will not make a sound when pressed down on.  Any that did not seal?  Open and enjoy right away or place in fridge for longer preservation.  We had this jam on rolls and biscuits and pancakes and all were fantastic!!!  Thanks for the recipe!  Especially liked finding a recipe for jam that did not use pectin.",

The 1st one was a Strawberry jam.\n\nI am not sure what I am did wrong, but just like the other one, I could not get it to thicken up. \n\nThe other problem I had with this recipe was that for me,  it came out super sweet. It is way easier to add sugar to make more sweet than to take away to make less sweet. So my recommendation is to start with 1/4 or 1/2 cup of sugar. If after tasting it, its not sweet enough for your taste, then just add more.",

I found this jam in the late evening and made it - super super easy! I used it as a filling for empanadas. Absolutely toddler-approved! Thank you!!!\n\nAdd-on: My first attempt at this recipe yielded a very thick jam.  I made it again tonight, and it was a perfect consistency after timing it correctly and cooking it for exactly 30 minutes, from the time I set the pot on the warm-ish stove until the timer beeped.  I think I might have slightly overcooked it the first time, but it was still good.\nThis time, I only used 3 cups of blueberries, and I added 1 cup of pureed figs; I added an extra, generous pinch of cinnamon.  It was heaven!\nAnother add-on: blueberries aren't in season so much for the fall, so, tonight, I used 1 cup of blueberries, 1 cup of raspberries, and 2 cups of blackberries (they were on sale!).  YUM YUM YUM!!!  I definitely followed the advice of the other reviewer who said when you run your spoon through it, and you can see the bottom of the pan (for just a second), then it's done.  The first time, I cooked it long enough that I could see the bottom for 4 to 5 seconds, and it was overcooked.",
