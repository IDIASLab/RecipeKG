I only did half with bacon.  Could not get them to fully cook through do to oil being on the high side since I am improvised with a meat thermometer. I suppose I could add another egg to the other half  to see if that helps with optimum fluff puffiness to get them up out of the oil. Try a couple with the bacon first , its different but good but different.",
