I don't have chicken bullion granules; what I do have are bullion cubes so I used 1 can of chicken broth and 4 cups water with 4 bullion cubes. I know that ups the sodium but the last time I checked it was a cup of water to a cube. At any rate I also added onions and garlic--I don't know how to cook without garlic. I popped this in the crock pot using peas and celery instead of carrots since I didn't have those either and hubs added chicken later on. It turned out rather spicy and flavorful and he keeps gobbling it up. Thanks for the recipe!",

I'm giving this 4 stars because there is something \"flat\" about the flavor.  It's not that it's bland, just missing something to give it depth.  I was so pleased on how the ham bone came out clean and all that great meat was \"saved\".  My husband, not much a soup eater, really enjoyed it (smelling it cook all afternoon whets the appetite for sure).  I made it again using some smoked bbq pork butt bones we had left over and he enjoyed that very much as well.  It's a definite keeper, I'll just keep playing with the seasoning to attempt to get more fullness out of the flavor.  (Going to try cayenne and fresh ground pepper to start). \n\nI will add a note about \"saltiness\", the first time I made this I about ruined it, it was SO salty.  I will not blame the recipe as the mistakes were mostly my own.  I made some substitutions , not having the right bullion, and then not realizing that the first ingredient of my Creole seasoning is salt.  I mention just in case anyone else it substituting - ham is already salty, check your salt sources and be VERY conservative if you are adapting.",
