On the second I didn't have the springform pan sealed quite right and the crust got soggy (the water must have leaked in a bit). Also...be sure to do just two small-medium bananas. I didn't think it looked like a lot and so added an extra banana...and it overwhelmed the peanut butter. Next time I will stick to the recipe! Still very good! I covered it with a ganache made from a cup or so of choocolate chips melted into about 1/5 cups of hevy whipping cream with a teaspoon of vanilla added.",
