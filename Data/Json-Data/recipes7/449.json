While I don't care for them I am trying to be fair to the recipe.b I had a garden with too many turnips in it and needed to get rid of some so I chose this recipe. I used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 skim instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and I still think it turned out a little too thick so I added some more milk. At that point for all you turnip lovers it was probably about 4 stars. However I don't like turnips so I added some instant mashed potato flakes milk and more sugar and it was much better for me. I guess I wouldn't try this unless you absolutely love turnips.",

I added the leftover pureed soup from the first batch and the result was a yummy chunky. turnip stew. I was hooked now! Had to go buy turnips for batch three - I increased the recipe by 1/3 so that I would have some to puree and add back to the pot. Added skim milk to the puree only but next time I will add liquid from the pot instead so that my soup/stew will be thicker. Will definitely need salt and pepper! SO GOOD!",
