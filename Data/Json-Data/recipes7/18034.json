                "reviewBody": "The crumble topping is amazing and I would give five stars to the crumble alone! The filling is where I had some problems. The raspberries and nectarines are slightly tart so only using 2 tbsp. of sugar left for a more tart filling that I would have preferred. There is also no thickener in the filling other than the natural pectin in the fruit. The filling was very runny. I would have preferred a thicker sauce with the fruit. 7/7/18 My review above was based on when we ate the dessert the same day we made it. Today I upped it from 3 to 4 stars. The flavors melded together and wasn t nearly as tart as it was yesterday. I do still think the sauce is a little thin for us and I would add a little thickner.",

Only two changes: I used cherries instead of raspberries so it wouldn't be too tart. I also sprinkled a bit of flour and cinnamon with the fruit to make it thicker. It was yummy! The top didn't get crispy at all but was still good.",
