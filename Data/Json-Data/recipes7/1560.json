I used a mix of rhubarb & sliced strawberries. I don't think it is too sweet in fact I added powdered sugar to the top after it was done in hopes that it would taste sweeter. also serving with ice cream sounds good and might balance out the tartness of the rhubarb!

Hopefully that won't change the caramelized effect too much - I might cut closer to 2/3 cups of the sugar that gets mixed with the fruit and only cut 1/3 cup of the sugar that goes in the batter. Second: I foolishly put this in the fridge in the original dish and now all of the delicious caramelized crust is stuck solidly to the sides. Next time I'll transfer it to something else first!",
