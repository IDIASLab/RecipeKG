I followed the recipe but instead of individual cups I made it in a 9x13 pan. Of course I needed to change the amounts but followed all the other general directions. I ended up using 2 small pound cakes cut into 1 inch squares 3 packages of instant lemon pudding 6 cups cold milk and 4 cups blueberries. (3 cups in it & 1 cup sprinkled on top of the whipped cream) I used the recipe for easy whipped cream from All Recipes also but I doubled it. It came out wonderful!!! Everyone loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again & as someone else said may switch up the pudding & fruit! (maybe French vanilla pudding & strawberries next time!)",

The lemon pudding wasn't very lemony so I think I'd use some lemon extract when mixing the pudding with the milk. I'd also use more blueberries. Wait to add the whipped cream right before serving. I liked that it was sort of old-fashioned like dessert my great-grandma made.",

I replace the pudding with using my homemade Lemon Curd (soft runny creamy consistency) which gave this a real lemony tang. Made it in the morning after reading another reviewer said hers was better the day after. In doing this it did soften the cake enough to make it soft pleasurable eating and well balanced with the sprinkling of blueberries on top savored with the cream. Every mouthful was absolutely YUMMY! Recipe was a good base idea with what I had to use. I will definitely make again the same with my change as it's so easy and quick.",
