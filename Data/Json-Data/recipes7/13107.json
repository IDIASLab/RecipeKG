The custard is mildly sweet and the fresh raspberries add a fresh tartness to the flavor. This dessert will impress anyone and trust me, everyone will ask for the recipe. Serve plain as a 'simple' dessert or add to the elegance by adding a dollop of creme fresh with a fresh raspberry to really give a nice presentation. Add a little mint leaf on the side, this will impress everyone. Serve warm or allow to cool for a firmer consistency.",

I gave it three stars because I think the thought is innovative and could be good with some modifications. If I were to make this again I d leave out the flour altogether. True custard doesn t have it. I also think crushing the berries would do away with the sour pockets of berries and incorporate the berry flavor throughout.",

I only had two cups of raspberries, so added a cup of blueberries as well.  I didn\u2019t have whole milk so used skim, and the last quarter cup of sugar over the top seemed too much, so I maybe used about an eighth cup.  Great warm from the oven, but great cold too.  My husband seems to prefer is cold.  Will definitely make this again!",
