The reviews saying it is \"too rich\" are ridiculous. Yes this pie is VERY rich but that is how peanut butter pie is supposed to be. I made a homemade chocolate graham cracker crust and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend that you do the same and double the recipe to make the crust extra thick. Regular store bought ones are too thin and do not provide enough of a balance of peanut butter and chocolate.",
