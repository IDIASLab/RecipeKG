                "reviewBody": "Since I am from Wisconsin an egg-based custard, as we call it, is what I'm used to.  This recipe is proof that ice cream can be rich and delicious even without eggs! I scaled the servings to six so it would fit in my Cuisinart ice cream maker, using a ratio of 2 cups heavy cream to 1 cup half and half, which is what suits my tastes.  I cut the vanilla back a bit (1 tsp. for a six serving recipe) and didn't use the food coloring. I added an extra half cup of strawberries, pureeing the first 1-1/2 cups, then just mashing the extra half cup. I didn't want the chunks too big as I know they just become icy and hard. Between the recipe itself and the slight changes I made I found this just perfect--I'm glad I cut back on the vanilla, as I didn't want it to interfere with the simple flavors of strawberries and cream on their own. Also, using the ratio of heavy cream and half and half as I do ensures a rich and creamy ice cream with a smooth mouth feel.  The amount of sugar the recipe calls for is just right. I added the salt as well, knowing it heightens flavors and makes it come to life, tho' this could easily be omitted. This is such a basic and easy recipe that it would work equally as well with other fruits, maybe only having to adjust the sugar depending on the sweetness of the fruit. Nothing's better than a cooked, frozen custard, but this quick and easy ice cream is a fine runner-up! ",

This was a fantastic recipe to begin with, but I just \"doctored\" it up a bit!",

The color was a beautiful light pink and so tasty. I will make this again. I bought organic strawberries from the farmers market. I cut the recipe in half but I only used 1/2 ts of vanilla since I didn't have the recipe in front of me and I couldn't remember what the recipe called for.This recipe is a keeper.",

I had a cup of crushed strawberries instead of the full 2 cups but it was plenty for us. I used 1% milk and evaporated milk since I didn't have cream. Very good strawberry flavor. I do think 1/4 teaspoon of salt is too much so I added 1/8 teaspoon. Even that was a little too much for me; I will only add a pinch next time.",
