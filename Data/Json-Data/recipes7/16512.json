I accidentally added all the coconut to the batter (instead of saving some of it for rolling the cookies as per the instructions), and still thought the batter was too wet to hold together so I added a couple extra tablespoons of BOB'S RED MILL GLUTEN FREE flour as well (MY MISTAKE: I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. My cookies were very good; however, they were not as moist as the same variety of cookies from the supermarket owing to my own failure to follow the instructions.) Next time I will try to follow the instructions more closely. Thank you Melanie for sharing your recipe.",
