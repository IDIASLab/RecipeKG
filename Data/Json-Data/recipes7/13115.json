My favorite part is the addition of the jalapeno and poblano peppers. Don't be scared to use them. They don't make the macaroni spicy, rather they give it a whole other level of flavor. Your guests will ask what you put in it. You can definitely taste the flavor of the peppers, but not the heat. The only issue I had was that I had to add way more mayo and water than called for before serving, otherwise it was too dry. A keeper!",

Then I add the bell peppers, jalapeno and poblano peppers, continuing to cook over low heat until tender and tasty. Make sure to get all the seeds out of the peppers or it will be really hot. Follow the recipe as stated otherwise. Omit the Cayenne pepper as their is plenty of heat in this one already. Cubed cheese goes well in this also.",

Mind blown.\nThe peppers give it a little spice, so if you are serving it to anyone sensitive to spice, you might want to just use bell peppers.\nThat being said, the spice is really not much and it compliments all the other flavors perfectly. This will be my staple mac salad for some time.",

The bit of heat from the peppers, along with the crunchiness of the other veggies makes it super delicious.  Truth be told, I didn't read the entire recipe before I made it, so I made it for dinner - right before dinner.  It was warm - and I did not let it sit for 4 hours.  Family was hungry.  It was still fabulous!  I would serve cold or warm.  Very, Very good.  My sweet little family RAVED about it.  Chalk one up for mom :)  Made it with grill asparagus and honey BBQ chicken.  Yowza",

I really don't like to see when people rate a recipe on here when they have changed so many ingredients but I must admit my husband forgot to buy green onion so I did have to substitute vidalia onion since it was too late to send him back out to the store.   Other than that, everything else was exact.  We didn't find the salad too spicy at all.  It was delicious and with just the 2 of us we have been eating it every day with meals or even as a snack.  I think next time I might add 50% more veggies but I am definitely making this again and again.  Delicious!  And when I add those green onions next time I know it will be even better.  Thanks for a wonderfully delicious and easy macaroni salad.",

My husband said it needed more dressing, and he didn't care for the peppers in it. I'm fairly sensitive to heat from peppers, and I did not find this to be too spicy. I made another quarter recipe of dressing to add to the salad for leftovers.",
