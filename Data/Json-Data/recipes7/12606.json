I tried these because I was craving something sweet but only had a half stick of butter and no eggs. This is now my 'go-to' cookie recipe! It's fast, it's easy, and it's healthier compared to other cookies while still fully satisfying your sweet-tooth. \nI made 2 batches. The first batch, I decided to add 1/3 cup more flour because of the loose and sticky consistency of the dough. The next batch I tried chilling the dough for about 15 minutes before handling (you may want to increase the chill time). Both batches came out tasting great but the dough is much easier to handle when you add more flour. Both batches also made for very moist cookies, however,  the original recipe is a little more moist. Ultimately, my husband and I slightly preferred the batch with less flour. \nI used almond oil instead vegetable oil and I used coconut milk instead of almond milk for both batches (personal preferences as well as what I had on hand). I added a good sized pinch of the sugar-cinnamon mixture into both batches before rolling the dough into balls and finally rolling them in the sugar-cinnamon mix before baking. I lined the cookie sheet with wax paper and sprinkled a little of the sugar-cinnamon mix on the paper before placing the cookies on the sheet. Baking for 10 minutes at 375 F was perfect for my oven. \nThese cookies will now",

If the dough is too wet you can chill it for an hour. Family enjoyed them and the two vegans at dinner were very appreciative of my effort. ONE THING - I recommend you serve them the same day you bake them. I baked mine and then stored them overnight and they became very soft. To maintain the texture of this snickerdoodle serve them the same day.",
