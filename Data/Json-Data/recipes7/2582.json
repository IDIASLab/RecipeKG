I stuck to the recipe but added a bit more crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce because of other reviewers' comments that there wasn't enough sauce. There was just the right amount of chili powder and ground cloves; they weren't overpowering. I topped the peppers with some additional grated Parm before serving. Tip: if using converted rice (eg. Uncle Ben's ) you'll need to start with just under 1/2 cup of uncooked rice. Cook the rice while you're preparing the sauce then set aside to cool.",
