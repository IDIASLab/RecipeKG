I looked over the ingredients and decided to give this recipe a try.  I had to use frozen Bluberries instead of fresh because fresh are WAY to EXPENSIVE right now.  I thawed the berries then drained the juice that comes along with fruit being frozen.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I added a tiny bit more cinnamon (because it is a wonderful spice) and about a 1/2 c. more of the berries just because I had a little extra.  The pie smelled wonderful as it baked and when my hubby finally arrived home we tasted it. Oh dear..very very good!  My husband said the only complaint he had was it didnt have vanilla ice cream to go along with it. (I thought about that half way through the cooking process) Oh well..I will buy some today and we will enjoy the pie again tonight. But this time with some vanilla ice cream.\nThanks for the recipe Natalie--it was DELICIOUS!  What a treat.",

If you are using frozen blueberries it is very important to allow them to reach room temperature and drain off the excess liquid.  Otherwise your pie will be soupy.  Also, along the lines of frozen berries, you will need measure out more than 3 cups (you're looking at more like 4 1/2 to 5) so that when they are thawed and drained you'll end up with the 3 cups the recipe calls for.  This recipe also works very well with other berries: raspberry, blackberry, strawberry, or try a mixture of berries.  Also is perfect using the \"Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust\" also found on Allrecipes.com Happy Baking!!",

We only had frozen blueberries so we increased the amount to 5 cups (measured when frozen).  The blueberry mixture was VERY watery and I was afraid it wouldn't set so I added one extra tablespoon of tapioca and it set beautifully! The pie was very sweet and didn't have the nice tartness blueberry pies should have so next time I will decrease the amount of sugar.  I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled sanding sugar over the top crust.  I also decreased the oven temperature by 15 degrees because it always seems to keep my crust from burning.  Everybody loved it and I would definitely recommend this recipe!  UPDATE:  I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet.  Next time I will try 3/4 cup.",
