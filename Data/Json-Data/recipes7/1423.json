The only change I made was in the amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce used. This will of course depend on personal preference but my husband and I often feel that the Chinese food served at restaurants in America is too salty/strong. I grew up in a Chinese family and actual Chinese cooking is milder. So when marinading the chicken I used only enough soy sauce and oyster sauce to generously coat the meat (I did not measure but am sure that it was less than what the recipe called for) and let that sit for approx. 20 minutes. The flavor came out perfectly for us -- strong enough to enjoy the chicken and veggies but not overpowering to the point where all you can taste is sauce.",
