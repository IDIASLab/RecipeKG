The first piece I didn't soak long enough and the cornflakes didn't want to stick. The next piece I soaked longer but that used up too much egg mixture and I didn't have enough to do 4 pieces of toast. The recipe doesn't say to use spray or to butter the baking dish - I used a sheet pan lined with parchment and sprayed the parchment with cooking spray. Unfortunately between toasting the bread baking and lack of oil or butter these were just too dry for us. This could be a tasty breakfast with a few modifications.",
