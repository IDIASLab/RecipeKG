I not only painted it (using a q-tip) with the food color mixture afterward but also drizzled grenadine on top to look like blood. Served on a cutting board with a small cleaver. Unfortunately it was barely touched since it looked too real. The few people who dared said it was delicious though. I also made a \"pig aorta\" in a shot glass using the same method - grossed out a lot of folks on social media! (see in photos above) You could use this recipe for all kinds of different molds - I'm thinking severed fingers.",
