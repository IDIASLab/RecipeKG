This recipe makes about 8 classic waffles and are quite filling for my family of 4 I could have made 1/2 a batch.. The black berry syrup is tasty - I used frozen berries and it worked out fine. I accidentally let my syrup cook too long so it turned to jelly but I just added a little water. My daughter liked these and she doesn't usually like waffles.",

I did add a heaping tablespoon of sugar to the waffle mix though and also added the optional cinnamon and vanilla extract and I'm glad I did. The family loved these waffles! Next time I might cut back to 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of a tablespoon because the cinnamon was a hint strong. The blackberry sauce was perfect! We will definitely be making these again.
