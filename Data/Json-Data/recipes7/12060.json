From personal experience I added a 1/2 teaspoon salt. (Pie filling has Pumpkin Sugar Syrup Water Salt Natural Flavors Spices in it already so I am not sure how that would work.) The consistency of the batter made with pumpkin puree was just right. Thanks for a nice Fall breakfast treat!",

That's why they are doughy even though they are beautifully golden on the outside. Added a T of oil and maybe 2 T more milk based on every recipe I have made for pancakes but the omission of salt is basic baking chemistry. Too late to add it now without having patches of salt. Next time I will reduce the powder add the salt add more pumpkin and leave the extra milk and oil out. I will let you know.",

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just used a healthy dose of cinnamon and nutmeg and I also used a gluten free flour substitute (which often makes my pancakes more crumbly) but it worked just fine this time.

Pancakes are his favorite food in the world) but he was stymied after two and a half. Love this recipe... It's been saved!.",
