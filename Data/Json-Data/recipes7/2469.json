I substituted the shortening w/ 1/2 coconut oil half vegan butter and it worked out fine. Great way to use my persimmons that were getting old:) thx!",

WHEN I MIXED EVERYTHING UP THE DOUGH LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT NEED MORE FLOUR SO I ADDED ABOUT 1/2 CUP OF ALL PURPOSE FLOUR AND ANOTHER 1/2 CUP OF BROWN RICE FLOUR. THE DOUGH WILL BE VERY STICKY. I ALSO ADDED ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF CHOPPED CANDIED GINGER. OH MY GOSH... YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THESE! THE FLAVOR IS INDESCRIBABLY GOOD BUT I'LL TRY.
