I think for me the timing of the baking was off a little because I was thinking they were too done at 12 minutes so the second pan I baked for 10 minutes which wasn't quite enough. I'm wondering if baking at 350 for the 15 would be best. I would suggest that if you bake one pan at a time that you keep the extra dough refrigerated because the second pan was flatter as it warmed up. I had problems with the caramel drizzle too. It was hard to get it runny enough to drizzle (I even added a little cream thinking that would help) and once it got on the cookies it was hard to bite through. I'm thinking that another drizzle would work better--maybe just melted white chips. I don't want to discourage anyone from making these because they have promise and that's why I'm giving them a 4 rating. They are sweet but after all so are cinnamon rolls! Thanks Mrs. Williams! PS. We miss you on the Buzz!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe definitely has potential but needs some tweaking. My oven is a little hot at 375 but rather than reduce the heat I baked for 5 minutes turned and baked for 5 minutes more. The cookies were crisp after cooling without being overdone. My yield was 4 1/2 dozen. I see three options for the glaze. I agree with the reviewer who said that straight melted caramel is too hard to bite through. It also sticks to your teeth too much. The glaze requires 1 caramel per cookie not 12 caramels. You can press one into the top when you turn the pan and let it melt then but I'm not sure that would resolve the hard and sticky issue. I melted mine with a couple tablespoons of milk in the microwave and it came out much better. Next time I'll just make the glaze on the stovetop with 1/2 cup butter 2 tsp. milk and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Much easier than unwrapping all those candies and much easier to control the consistency.",
