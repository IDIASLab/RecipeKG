It's bright and glossy, and doesn't thicken so fast that you have to rush to get your cookies glazed. Other than having to add more milk than called for (certainly no biggie) this was just what I was after. I also appreciated that there no flavorings in the ingredients, something each cook can do on his/her own if they choose.  For me, I liked the neutral flavor.",

Use this mini batch with a small cake tip to outline your cookies or decorations first. Let the outline dry and then follow as written.

I used 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of water brought it to a boil over medium heat and simmered for 5 minutes on low heat. I used an electric mixer to mix everything together then separated into 2 batches and added coloring to one and left one white for the snowmen. My icing didn't come out super white because I used brown turbinado sugar instead of white sugar and I added vanilla extract which also made it darker but it still looked white enough.

(A very very subtle maple syrup flavour if you're looking for it. Turned the icing just a very faint shade of beige but once you add food colour you wouldn't even notice it.) My daughter loved this icing so much she started suggesting we do cookies with this icing in lieu of a birthday cake!!!!!! Note that if you want to put sprinkles on top (like in the photo) you must ice and then sprinkle that same cookie and then repeat. Don't wait to pour all the icing before starting to sprinkle! The icing hardens so fast that by the time you finish pouring it all the icing is already dry and the sprinkles won't stick!",
