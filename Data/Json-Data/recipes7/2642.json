My Kids actually said they tasted like 'pumpkin pie sticks\". I prepared them exactly as the recipe was written but didn't make the glaze. I don't think they needed them at all. Also one potato would have been enough to feel my family. I hope these heat up well cause I have plenty left. I will definitely make these again. Edited to add: These fries are soggy the next day but after re-heating can be eaten with a fork have more of a soft sweet potato texture and flavor is still good.",
