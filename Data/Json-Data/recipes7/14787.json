Because we have access to fresh, local and sweet pineapple, we tried this, mainly because it doesn't take a boxed cake mix.  They cut fresh pineapple, made the sugar butter sauce, decorated the bottom of the cake, and we baked it.   They were very impressed by the beautiful presentation, and ate it still warm.  \n\nI will make this again, but with some changes.  I think it was too sweet and the amount of butter was too much, I think.  It was very good, but I will make 1/2 more batter, and use less sugar and butter so that it is more cakey.",

However, while making the sugar butter I turned my back for a sec to start the dry ingredients and burned it, so I dumped it, cleaned my skillet and started over. The second go, I stirred constantly, but I think I let it cook a bit too long, as the butter and sugar kind of split and darkened. It looked perfect moments before but I was waiting for the sugar to melt a little more. I used it anyway. Smells like some yummy browned butter!\n\nEverything else in the recipe went well. When I put the batter in the skillet it didn't look like it was going to be enough to cover it, but after spreading, it was just enough. However, if the cake is delicious, I may add a half or double the batter next time as the cake isn't as thick as I envisioned. Like another reviewer, I chose to use fresh cherries instead of pecans (and used fresh pineapple too).\n\nTo be continued...",
