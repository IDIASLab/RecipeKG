I have one correction to share that may improve the recipe especially for the person who already tried it. The pineapple should be the first layer: Spread pineapple over crust; pour blended cream cheese over it. Sprinkle top with nutmeg (Aunt Tootie's secret ingredient) Enjoy!",

I thought it would taste more like a cheese cake? Also mine got so runny that the pinapple sunk in some spots. I think it is supposed to have 2 distinct layers. I have never had pineapple pie and I had all the ingrediants in the pantry so I gave it a whirl. Thanks for sharing.",
