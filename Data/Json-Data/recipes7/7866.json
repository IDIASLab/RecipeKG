I did this to get more of a vanilla custard pie instead of a plain custard pie.\nAlso, I definitely didn't need to let the pie sit in the refrigerator for more than 2 1/2 hours before doing the caramelized sugar on top. \nAnd although the broiler technique is great for caramelizing the sugar on top and giving it that creme brulee look, it also burns any exposed crust. I had to cut off the excess crust. That wasn't too big of a deal though, took less than 2 minutes.\nFinally, the recipe says cool for 5 minutes before serving. No. Nonono. Refrigerate for at least 25 minutes before serving.\nDespite my critiques, overall this is a really delicious pie, and definitely something I'll make again.",
