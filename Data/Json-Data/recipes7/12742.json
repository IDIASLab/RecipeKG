I wasn t too concerned because I thought the recipe had too much bacon anyway. I was wrong it isn t too much bacon YOU NEED IT ALL! I wasn t sure the first batch of cookies were cooked enough so I baked for 15 minutes; my mistake they were overdone. I took the next batch out of the oven at exactly 12 minutes and I had soft tender perfectly cooked cookies. An unusual combination of ingredients for cookies for sure but it works. I ve had this recipe saved for a long time and I m glad I finally got around to making it. Krissy thanks for sharing your recipe I liked it.",
