It was so smooth and melt in your mouth delicious. Very sweet of course too. I have a gas stove so I started off with low heat like the recipe said and kept it there for the whole recipe - basically from fear that it'd burn and not turn out well if I turned up the heat (like I said, not an experienced candy maker yet) It sure took a while to get to 240F like this but the end result was worth it. I will definitely make this recipe again, daring to venture into turning up the heat next time as the recipe states. I also toasted my pecans. Thanks so much for sharing!",

I had a pan with 12 openings [square],greased it with unsalted butter ,pecans and about 1/3 cup of the hot candy. I placed a whole pecan on the top and smiled.They were shiny and beautiful! My husband and I ate the little ones I turned out on Parchmont paper.We were impressed! Very nice candy .Thank you for sharing. I will carefully make these again!!!!",

Unless you like paper stuck to the bottom of your pralines you will be disappointed. I threw out my first batch because of this. For the second batch I switched to parchment paper and they turned out fine. They do start to set up quickly so work fast. Two tablespoons was the technique I used. One to scoop up the mixture and the other to catch the drippings as I moved to the paper. The second spoon also help get all the mixture off the first spoon. They are easy to make and can be made well in advance of gifting. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe.",

I liked that they were very easy---no need to stand at the stove stirring for a long time. Once it starts to boil you stop stirring and just keep an eye on the candy thermometer. Keep in mind that they start to firm up within a few minutes once you start putting them on the cookie sheets. So move quickly. My 12-year-old daughter put the pecans on to help with that. Thanks for a fun and easy recipe!",
