This takes up the majority of the prep time. I bake the rolls instead of frying them to cut down on the calories, but you can deep fry them for extra flavor. If you can't find spring roll wrappers, use the egg roll wrappers. They don't bake well, so deep-fry them instead. Use real soy sauce brewed from soybeans, and not the stuff with caramel coloring and salt.",

However, there is definitely some miscommunication with the egg roll vs spring roll wrappers. I took from the video that spring rolls can be baked and egg roll wrappers do better fried. I don't know if there are different types of spring roll wrappers but that's what I used. I liked the idea of a light wrapper and no frying. I tried baking them, and they basically melted away. I followed the recipe as written and as others suggested, I tried brushing a bit of oil to help crisp them up. The wrappers were almost like a clear goopy semi dissolved wrap and stuck to the pan.  I'm assuming the problem is me. The kids and hubby liked them ...but with a spoon... That's right, a spoon. ;)\n\nUPDATE: talked with an Asian cooking instructor who was doing demos at our grocery today. Spring roll wrappers can be baked (with a bit of oil brushed on) BUT NOT THE RICE SPRING ROLL WRAPPERS! She pointed me to a package of frozen spring roll wrappers and the first ingredient was wheat.  Looked like the wrappers from the AR video...I guess that would have been my first clue... :)",

The filling had a good flavor in both, but DH and I both enjoyed the baked rolls over the fried ones.  The cranberry dipping sauce was wonderful with this recipe and I would make again to go with other Asian foods I make.  I found egg roll wrappers to be very easy to work with and will be using them again.  You could make this recipe with any type of filling.  i.e.  just veggies, chicken, turkey, pork.  I plan on making another batch and freezing the spring rolls on a cookie sheet before they are baked.  When ready to serve, pull out the number needed and bake.  Thanks otis for sharing your recipe.  It made me realize that spring/egg rolls are very easy to put together.",
