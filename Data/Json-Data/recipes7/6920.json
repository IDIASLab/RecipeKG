I was lazy so didn't do the crumb topping. And I had no cashews so I substituted walnuts. The only thing I would change would be more rhubarb and less strawberry maybe even try 100% rhubarb. Also this recipe's cook/prep time is way off. Mine was on desert plates within 2 hours of when I started to throw things in the mixing bowl.",
