I've subbed craisins for the dried cherries and it's still good, but the dried cherries are sooo much better- they add a nice tartness that's very complimentary to the dressing. Fresh strawberries might be good too. Sometimes I've also added a bit of yellow mustard and onion powder to the dressing and that's quite good as well. I've found the dressing is better when run through the food processor a minute- it really gives it a much smoother consistency- I've tried to cheat and skip this step, but it's kinda clumpy even if you whisk it good... still tastes good though! And like the submitter says in their review, it is better if made the night before, or even that morning. I use whatever salad veg I have on hand at the time. Make sure you use a good crisp apple like a honeycrisp, braeburn or fiji, cause that is really the star of this salad.  I've also added chunked up chicken breast to make this a main dish salad and that is wondewrful as well. To sum it up, this recipe is filed in my recipe book under 'Best Salad Ever'!",

I was looking for something OTHER than a salad with strawberries (only because I'm tired of them.)  I tried this last night and it was a HUGE hit!  Believe me, the ladies that I served it to have eaten and prepared every type of salad and they raved about this one.  So much so that I had to get on the computer and print out 20 copies!  The only changes I made was to mix the butter lettuce with romaine (all butter tends to get too soggy) and I had cheese on the side.  I love all cheeses but some people are too picky so I had 3 bowls sitting by the salad bowl (buffet-style) one with goat cheese, one feta and one blue cheese.  It worked perfectly.  Also, I bought the pecans already candied (Emeralds \"Pecan Pie\" pecans - to die for).  So, for my first review I got too wordy... bottome line is WONDERFUL salad!",
