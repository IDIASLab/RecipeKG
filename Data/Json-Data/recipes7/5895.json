I followed the sauce recipe as written and added 1 tsp. of ginger.  I used 2 packages of fresh cut up broccoli, carrots, and snow peas (stir fry blend) instead of the listed veggies. Also, I only had cooked shrimp, so I added those at the end just until they were hot.  I normally am not this lazy but am in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and could probably fall asleep standing.  ha!  My husband & I enjoyed those cruncy chow mein noodles on top as well.  My 21-month-old daughter gobbled up the shrimp and brown rice (veggies too crisp for her) with a side of peas.  I'll make this again.  I'd make it with chicken, too.",

I didn't have cider vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. I had green onions on hand all chopped and ready to go so I used them in place of the white onion. I also didn't have any mushrooms so I omitted them completely. I added crushed red pepper for an extra kick as my husband loves it spicy a splash of orange juice as I found that the sauce was way too thick and wanted to thin it out a bit. At the very end I threw in some parsley and it turned out great!!!! No leftovers in this house! Thanks for the recipe! I will be making again! Yummmmmmmmmm.....",

My only other deviations from the recipe were to leave out the onions to use 5 1/5 tbsp of soy sauce instead of six (ran out!) and to use regular white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. The result was indeed very tasty. My only caveat was that the sauce thickened up tremendously upon hitting the skillets -- far too much. Maybe I had the heat up too high but I had to mix in some extra water and next time will probably mix in even more. However the flavor combinations were terrific and it makes for a very satisfying meal.",
