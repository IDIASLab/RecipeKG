Use the sugar in the recipe to roll the dough in. Place them in the pan and let rise. Meanwhile mix the coconut milk with 4 TBS of the sweetened condensed milk pour only half of the mix over the rolls and bake accordingly. When you take them out of the oven use a fork to seperate the rolls and flip them over so that the tops are facedown in the sauce. Remove rolls from pan and pour remaining coconut milk into the pan to \"deglaze it\" pour this over the rolls and serve.",

If ever there was a more yummy ultra simple bread to make I don't know what it would be. I ended up making 36 and had to double all the ingredients and do two pans for obvious reasons. One of the other reviews said that the rolls should be \"swimming\" in the coconut mixture prior to baking so I made sure that they were. I did need to add a bit more regular milk to make sure I had enough liquid. It was perfect. One pan had coconut sprinkled on it the other one didn't. The very few leftovers made a great breakfast with coffee the next morning. Will for sure make again.",
