They baked these cookies and if I could have given the recipe 20 stars, I would have.  They did not use the nuts and used half white and half brown sugar.  Fabulous.  I came home and made the recipe with the nuts but used half white and half brown sugar too.  I put the batter into the fridge for about an hour and then used a scoop to portion out.  They were thick & soft.  It turned out an A + keeper.  Thank you so much for this easy to prepare recipe.",

For the shortening, I used a combination of butter, shortening and coconut oil (just 1 Tb for added flavor). The butter means it's no longer pareve, but that wasn't something I was concerned about. (If it is a concern, stick with shortening or coconut oil if you like coconut!) I also substituted pecans for the walnuts. The recipe made 2 1/2 dozen standard-size cookies (similar in size to packaged cookies). The color may be lighter than expected compared to \"regular\" chocolate chip cookies, but watch the browning of the bottoms to make sure they don't overcook.",
