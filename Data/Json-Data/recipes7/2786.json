I served it with tortilla chips, but people enjoyed scooping it up with celery, red pepper, and even used it as a condiment on their hot dogs and burgers!  I cut the recipe in half after reading other reviews and it still made plenty for the crowd of 20 that were at the cookout.  I did make the full amount of dressing, but reduced the amount of olive oil by 1/2 since some people said it was too oily.  It came out great! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!",

First time around was good,but too beany.Think more veggies will balance it better.Might even try serving room temperature with refried beans to help bind the babies together.It tends to jump.4/12 'Tried again.Not so impressed this time.No, not bad;but no wows either.Did 1black,1pinto,2 green peppers,2japs,1/2c red onion,1c corn, 1/2bunch cilantro (bout 1c),2plum toms, 3cl garlic,1t kosher salt,1T olive oil,3T lime juice,a T chipolte pepper w adobo sauce,1/4t cayenne.Not so pretty ;D but still pretty healthy (Win!).Soo,if I make again,I'll add more lime juice&more spice.This is one to play with. 3 1/2 stsrs",
