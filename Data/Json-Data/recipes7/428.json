So I made it again and took the time to caramelize the potato and onion (the first time i was in a rush and didn't wait for the color to turn). I think that really help bring out the flavor. I added the rosemary during the saute and additional 1 tsp when i added the stock. I used whole milk instead of half and half. I loved it the second time! will defiantly make again.",

I didn't have russet potatoes but I did have the tri-color mini potatoes and those worked just as fine. It did delay the caramelization time however but no biggie. Added a little bit more sugar and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. Don't have cayenne pepper so I used Paprika red peppers and black pepper. Lastly I used milk instead of the half & half and just for giggles I included a quarter cup of white wine and about a tbsp of Dijon mustard. Blended that all together and WOWZA! I wanted to lick pan clean it was that tasty. Will definitely be making this again!",
