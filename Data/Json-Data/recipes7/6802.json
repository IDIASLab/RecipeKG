I started by adding about 1/2 cup finely chopped red onion. I omitted the water and skipped the microwave. I drained and rinsed the beans added the chopped mango cuke and onion and tossed to combine. In a small bowl I whisked together the lime juice cumin cilantro salt and pepper. I \"pasted\" one clove of garlic (rough chop the garlic add some salt then press the flat of the knife on to the garlic and drag until paste) I then whisked in about 2 Tblsp olive oil. I poued this dressing onto the bean mixture and folded and stirred until evenly coated. For this dish to be at it's potential it MUST be made the day ahead. Cover tightly and store in the fridge. This will allow the flavors work their magic and penetrate the beans. Otherwise this recipe would come out too bland.",
