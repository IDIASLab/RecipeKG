I used the rest of the recipe as is. I topped mine with vanilla frozen yogurt instead of icecream.\n\nI found that it needed a bit more sweetness in the cake itself but instead of adding sugar I'll be adding adding more chocolate chips and a maybe a tad bit less flour next time. Remember to mix the batter right before it goes in or the chocolate chips settle. Letting it cool is very important as it helps the heat distribute and finish up that cooking.\n\nTips:\n\nSince you are making one at a time let it cool all the way and taste it. I added a bit of sugar to the batter before putting in my second one. You can adjust as you go based on your taste.\n\nCup shape MATTERS. Using a wide cup will lead to too much exposed surface area and a crusty overcooked surface. Use something that is more cylindrical. Also some cups change width a lot from base to top. They don't allow for even cooking. \n\nFinally remember: it may not look as good as Chef John's but it'll still taste awesome.\n\nLet's hope Chef John comes out with a Brownie recipe too!",

I followed the directions except I used white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet minis and walnuts instead of almonds b/c that's all I had.  I really wish I had the minis, because the large choco chips sunk right to the bottom and stuck to the mug!  This cake is chocolatey without being too sweet or rich and the milk added a nice creamy taste.  However, next time, I will use 2 or 2.5 T of milk, because I had just a bit too much liquid.  The cake formed, but there was a little \"chocolate milk\" liquid around it.  (Microwaved mine for just over a minute because I just used one larger mug rather than a few smaller ones.)  I'll probably make this again as it's a great cake to randomly make for 1-2 people.",
