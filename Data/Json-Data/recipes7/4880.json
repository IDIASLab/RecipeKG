I used three single-serve packets of Splenda instead of sugar which worked great. I'm always looking for a shortcut so instead of dissolving the gelatin separately I just mixed it into the warm coffee/splenda before it came to boiling on the stove. This seemed to work very well but I'm not familiar enough with gelatin to know if that's recommended or not. Thanks very much for sharing.",
