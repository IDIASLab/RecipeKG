Definitely a seasonal comfort beverage for me! I prefer to use fresh juices with pulp. The flavors are different. Canned pineapple in light syrup is best. Set the pineapple chunks aside for the rest of your holiday baking. Store leftovers in refrigerator and reheat as needed.",

Just a quick tip for brewing the tea - I brew mine for 15 minutes (perfection) and add just a pinch of baking soda to the hot water which takes out any bitterness in the tea. Try drinking this over ice as well - equally delicious!! Thank you Carmen for submitting such a wonderful recipe!",

So I added the tea bags back in for another 10 minutes (I had already discarded the cinnamon and cloves).
