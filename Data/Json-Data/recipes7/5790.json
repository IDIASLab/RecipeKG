Canned tomatoes are already high in sodium. This only needed a generous 1/4 tsp. I used honey in place of the sugar and added a tsp of Italian seasoning along with only a pinch of cloves. Be sure to temper the milk before adding all to the pot and don't overheat the soup to keep it from curdling. Really quite smooth and rich considering the lack of cream. It was the perfect pair for veggie & cheese quesadillas. Made a light but filling meal. Thanks so much for the recipe. I'll be making this again especially as it calls for ingredients that are always on hand.",

I followed the recipe exactly except left out the black pepper because I don't care for it and subbed nutmeg for the cloves. I didn't have ff evaporated milk but had 2% evaporated milk which worked fine. Make sure that onion is softened beyond the 10 minutes. I assumed mine was but still had some uncooked onion bits. I did use a hand emulsion blender to make it easy. This went fine with grilled cheese for dinner tonight.",
