I didn't add salt because it is already in the soy sauce. I also added a bit of cayenne and a pinch of corriander for some extra flavour. Yum Yum - if you make half of the recipe you will have some coconut milk left for coconut rice which pairs so well. Goes well with steamed asparagus on the side. mmmmm.",

I cooked for 30 minutes (others suggested longer cooking times for chicken legs but that longer time would have dried out the breast meat). Some of the chicken broke down a bit into small \"shreds \" which was actually nice in the sauce! Not having whole peppercorns on hand I used slightly less than one teaspoon of ground black pepper. I increased the onion and garlic to my personal taste and used \"light\" coconut milk to reduce the fat content. Do not leave out the bay leaves -- while not overpowering they definitely add to the flavor. This was delicious and it provided generous leftovers as there were only two of us. We served over rice but I imagine it would be nice over pasta as well.",
