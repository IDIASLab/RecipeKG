I served it over brown rice and quinoa and added one extra tablespoon of Thai red curry paste. It was very pleasantly tasty; warm spice not hot. I think the next time I make it I'll try it with tofu. Since I had to go gluten-free in 2012 AllRecipes.com has helped me become so much more adventurous a cook than I've ever been before.",

The first time it was so hot that my husband and I couldn't eat it after adding two or three times as much coconut milk! (we can both eat a level 4 from a restaurant.) I did half as much panang curry paste this time because my daughter can only handle a 1 usually. It's a little closer to a 2 than she likes but it could use a little more spice for me. I couldn't find the keffir leaves this time but I found ground keffir and used that instead. All and all pretty good! Now we just have to get used to the smell of fish oil that seems to permeate everything..",
