After some thought I decided to try preparing it pumpkin bread style, since they are both in the squash family. I boiled my zucchini (skins attached), and then pureed it. It is so similar to pumpkin bread in texture, and the taste... it is out of this world.",

I have already rated it based on the way it was written.\n\nI changed the serving size to 24 because as written, it will make 3 loaves. By changing the size to 24, it makes 2 loaves.\n\nI used 1 cup puree for each loaf. I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. This gave it a deeper, more rich flavor. I cut the cloves in half as they were too strong for my liking. And instead of oil, I used unsweetened apple sauce with 1 tablespoon oil before measured.\n\nWith the above changes, the bread was exceptionally moist and flavorful. The applesauce rids the bread of greasiness that sometimes comes with this type of bread. \n\nI will be trying it with my changes with fresh pumpkin as well.",

I had an enormous zucchini from my neighbour's garden I cut it up and steamed it in the microwave for 15 minutes drained off liquid then pureed. I used 2/3 cup of zucchini puree and it worked fine froze the rest for future loaves. I halved the sugar amount and used brown sugar I halved the oil amount and used melted butter used pumpkin pie spice for the spices I used Robin Hood Flax flour for the all purpose. My loaf baked in 55 minutes. Very tasty tastes exactly like pumpkin loaf! #FreshFaces #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada",
