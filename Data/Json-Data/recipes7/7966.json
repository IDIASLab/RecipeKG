The recipe is below if anyone is interested.\nIcing\n1/2 cup confectioners' sugar,\n3/4 teaspoon almond extract \n3 teaspoons milk\n\nCombine all ingredients well. Drizzle over warm muffins.",

If I were to use them again with this recipe, I would spray the inside of the paper liners.  Would have liked a little more chocolate flavor, so I'll probably increase the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup, but that's a personal taste preference.  The best part of the muffin definitely is the burst of fresh raspberry flavor that you get.  That's what will keep me coming back.",

I have some raspberries that I needed to use.   never made raspberry muffins before and I don't have good experience making muffins I tried this recipe and it turned out better then I was expecting. fluffy, delicate and sweet muffins. I add 2 cups of raspberries because I wanted to use all I have left and replace the raspberry extract for almond extract as other suggested because I didn't have the other ingredient. I didn't do the crumble top because I don't think I need that and it was perfect. I am so happy I gave it a try. I will keep it in my recipe box. thanks for the recipe!",
