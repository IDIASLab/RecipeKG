I don't use butter bc it doesn't agree with me so I just used Pam instead to coat the pan. Thanks for the recipe!",

I did make mine a bit bigger than the recipe specified but I still only got 7 pancakes (excuse me pikelets) out of this recipe. Just a heads-up for anyone else who was thinking of trying these.
