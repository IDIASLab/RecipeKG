Dumped everything in the crockpot b4 work and wow was my nose assaulted w/ the most awesomest of aromas when I returned home.

It just depends on how much beef you'd like per spoonful:) I also added a 15 oz can of black beans because I love them and they were a nice addition a whole diced jalapeno pepper and about 3 times as much sugar as the recipe calls for - I personally like beef stews/chilis to be a little sweet. Because I added some things I added two cups of water to the recipe as well. I probably ended up using about a tablespoon and a half of salt. It's great with a shredded cheddar blend sprinkled over it and some avocado slices! And it ended up being enough to feed me for a few days and to share!",
