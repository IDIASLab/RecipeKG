Will try that next time. I also assumed the amount of sugar called for would be way too much for my tastes and it was. I cut it in half and I still feel it was a little too sweet. Also not sure if my cabbage was particularly large or what but I had WAY more cabbage left over than I expected (especially since the batch I made was enough for 8 people easy if not 10). I also love that this seems to be a very forgiving recipe - adjusting to taste for particularly the sugar but also vinegar and oil amounts. Comments I received: 'the bleu cheese makes it'. 'perfect!' 'so good!' Excellent recipe with some minor modifications - thanks OP! Can't wait to try this again with the suggested ACV.",
