I also grated my own cheese...a blend of sharp cheddar and Jack. Did everything else as written and we LOVED them! Definitely sprinkle with fresh cilantro before you fold over the tortilla...that's mentioned in the description, but not the ingredients. Served with black beans, sour cream and salsa and it's a wonderful meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

Also, I cooked mine in the oven (400 degrees until golden, spraying the bottom and top of the tortilla w/ cooking spray before baking). The flavors here are amazing! I served them w/ a side of guacamole, salsa and sour cream, but they really could stand on their own, they are that good! I will def be using this recipe often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I just added my spices straight from the shakers, but did add in some minced garlic. No need to put olive oil on the flour tortillas, they didn't stick to the pan at all. We served with some homemade guacamole and sour cream. Too bad I'm doing portion control or I could have pigged out on these! Thanks Dana!",

I browned them on the electric griddle rather than the stovetop as I was also making 'Vegetable Quesadillas' from this site and wanted all of them done at the same time.

I also added some garlic fresh mushrooms and wilted spinach to the mix for extra nutrition and because I had it to use. I wanted to do these \"restaurant-style \" in one big quesadilla and then cut it into wedges and I must confess I was nervous as heck doing so. A big spatula and a prayer turned it over in the pan effortlessly. When it came time to getting it out onto the plate I just merely slid it out from the pan. It's anybody's guess if it will work as smoothly the next time! I was really REALLY impressed with this. A little sour cream chopped green onion and some salsa (I used green) and I was in shrimp quesadilla heaven. Whether you serve this as a main course a snack or as an appetizer this WILL be a hit.",
