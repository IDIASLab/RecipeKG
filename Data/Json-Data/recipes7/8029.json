I couldn't find sugar free chocolate chips at my local grocers however I found miniature sugar free Hershey's dark chocolate bars. Two small bags crushed up worked perfectly! Reduces the sugar even more! Great for diabetics! Will definitely keep this recipe for the future!!",

They are delicious!\nI used a Tbs scoop to measure out the portions, and I ended up with 16 cookies that I did flatten out before baking, so each cookie measures about 2.75\" across.  Definitely not 30 cookies unless you made them super small.  \nI'm very happy with the results, super yummy.",
