                "reviewBody": "I need to preface my review by saying that I've been eating Primanti Brothers' sandwiches for 25 years. By my husband's estimate, we've eaten upwards of 300 of them. When we dated, we used to go to one of the older Primanti's Restaurants in Oakland. There, we used to sit on barstools and watch them make our sandwiches. Lots and lots of sandwiches. I need to let the reader know this because there are a number of discrepancies in this recipe. The ingredients are very accurate, and the cole slaw is a good approximation of the original (which actually varies pretty greatly depending on which restaurant you're visiting). Yes, they use thickly sliced Italian bread. In 25 years not one of our sandwiches has been toasted or prepared using an oven. The bread is freshly sliced. The meat (we prefer corned beef) is tossed on a griddle top long enough to heat it through and start it curling up a bit. The cheese is quickly held to the hot griddle surface to start it melting, then it is laid on top of the hot meat. The meat/cheese is then placed on the bread and topped with the other ingredients. So while this recipe is close to the original, if you want the authentic Primanti's Sandwich, you need to prepare it the way they prepare it in the restaurant. You'll end up with a sandwich you can barely wrap your mouth around. This gets four stars from me, as it's not quite authentic, but it has the potential to be. Thanks for a good starter recipe.",

Used my own recipe for the fries followed directions otherwise. My friend who had never tasted these; loved it!! She took the recipe home to treat her own family. Thanks for reminding me of this great sandwich; it has been a few years since I have been back to Pittsburgh to get an original.",
