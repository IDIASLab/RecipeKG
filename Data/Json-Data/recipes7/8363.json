I substituted whole plain yogurt for the buttermilk. Substituted cream for the evaporated milk. I use coconut sugar for the cake portion . Also added some cinnamon to both the cake and sauce. HIGHLY recommend. The first time I made this my girlfriend who does not eat desserts tasted a bit out of politeness and ate 2 helpings!",
