I also beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on low, then beat in  the flour, and only THEN used my hands to work it together. It seems too dry at first, but then, miraculously, it's dough! Pro tip 2: You can cut it into any shape you like. Trees would be cute for Christmas. I used a patterned rolling pin to give mine a herringbone pattern, then cut it into circles with a biscuit cutter. Pro tip 3: Rosemary and chocolate are amazing together. I dipped an edge of each baked cookie in melted dark chocolate and sprinkled with Maldon sea salt and minced rosemary before the chocolate set. Heaven! ... I was a little short on rosemary for the second batch, so I only used 1 tablespoon and that was plenty. :)",

One of the reviewer's suggestions worked well and helped to speed up the process and yet did not compromise the quality. Instead of using a spoon to hand mix/blend the butter with the rosemary and list of items leading up to the flour, go ahead and put them into a food processor to blend. Then add the flour, using your fingers to blend. I have given this shortbread to a number of people, and everyone wants the recipe!\nEvery recipe I've tried from Chef John has been delicious. 'Am curious about his background, and really appreciate him sharing such terrific recipes! Thank you!",

The only problems I had with this recipe is 50 minutes is way too long at 300 degrees. I made the cookies 1/4\" thick and checked at 40 minutes and they were more than done. I should have checked at 25-30 minutes. They also came out flat but the taste is great. I will definitely make it again. I did increase the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the vanilla to 3/4 teaspoon. Some of them I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top before baking. I will definitely be making this again. The bad thing is they taste so good that you can't stop eating them.:) Edit: I roll the dough into a log and put in the freezer for about 20 minutes. Then cut 1/4\" thick and bake on parchment paper for about 20 minutes. Cold dough will not go flat. Perfect cookies. Yummm.",
