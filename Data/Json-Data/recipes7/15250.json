You can always add more if necessary but you can t take it out once it s in there. The other slight change I will make is not cooking the pineapple (don t think it needs it) rather I ll just stir it in at the end. The pineapple color changes when cooked and distracts just a little from the eye appeal (not a BIG deal here just personal preference and it doesn t affect the taste). I had my doubt about the combo of carrot and pineapple in oatmeal but you ll taste the sweet pineapple more...it works!",
