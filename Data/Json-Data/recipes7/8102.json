I cut the recipe in half, as I only needed 2 servings, which was more than adequate. Half the recipe makes 6-8 four inch pancakes (I used 1/3 cup measure for each). I also mixed the cornmeal in with the oats and buttermilk to soften for 5 minutes. Delicious whole grain flavor yet still light with a pleasing texture. Cooked up beautifully with nice golden color. A mainstay for sure!",
