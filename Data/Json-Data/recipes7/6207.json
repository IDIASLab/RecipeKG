I doubled the recipe because my chorizo was a half a pound package so I cooked it in a 9x13 dish for 28 minutes. Worked fine. I have to admit it tells you to cook the veggies in the dripping but I just can't let that much grease go into my families stomachs so I drained as much as I could from the skillet put the chorizo on a few paper towel so they would soak most of it up and left only maybe a teaspoon of the drippings in there to cook the veggies in. It tasted great and I felt much better getting rid of all that fat. I also have to say I didn't use KRAFT cheese I used the brand that I had. I will make this again because it resembles a dish my hubby always gets at Mexican restaurants.",

                "reviewBody": "I needed something new to do other than cooking chorizo and scrambled eggs for MY personal well being. This recipe does everything I needed. It looks extremely versatile. You could do anything with your essentially 1C wilted spinach (I recommend chopping your spinach before cooking for easier slicing!!!) and 2C chopped tomatoes. Use bell peppers/white onion (rinsed of course!)/serranos/tomatoes. Someone suggested mushrooms. You could do other greens besides spinach and you could change cheeses to cheddar or any of the lovely Mexican cheeses (in the round you know the ones!). Even more fun you could use Soyrizo instead of the meat kind. You could also flip this to use 8 oz of bacon 8 oz of sage or farmer's sausage ground and cooked. Use your imagination. This is a fantastic recipe. I would only suggest leaving it in a bit longer than 25 unless you like a softer scramble. If you like scrambled medium or hard I suggest ADDING 3-5 cooking time---or just turning off the oven and then setting the table---making sure the edges of the egg do not burn (I used a clear pyrex dish so I could visually check). Overcooking the edges of this dish would just ruin it. I have to say my family did not like this recipe as much as they would have liked plain chorizo/eggs/tortillas--oh well. I consider this a classier more subtle more festive dish. Perfect for parties. Also I sliced it in 6ths but you could try 8ths or even 12ths for a potluck. It is quite filling!",
