I tasted the honey-butter sauce after pouring it over the chicken and was horrified at the extremely salty taste but that went away. I used the rosewater because I had it but don't go out of your way to buy it; the flavor doesn't really come through (that was kind of a disappointment). I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that's all we eat and seared them on the stovetop in a little additional butter. I then added the sliced peaches and poured the sauce over all. I didn't use the tablespoon of sugar. I then put the skillet in the oven and baked for 20 minutes at 400. The result was delicious! A bite of chicken & peach together was wonderful! I highly recommend using the toasted slivered almonds because they add a welcome crunch and flavor.",
