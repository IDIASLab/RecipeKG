                "reviewBody": "I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water, buttermilk (that I warmed with the water) and sugar for ten minutes, melted butter, egg and all the dry ingredients. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, I had a little bit of an issue with the bread hook actually wanting to knead the bread dough in the mixer bowl. It kept wanting to kick the dough out! I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. I did get 12 large rolls, not nine out of this recipe. 400* for 15 minutes was absolutely perfect. HUGE dinner rolls that were a little different texture and flavor-wise from your typical bread rolls. That's not a bad thing, it's just different. Next time I make these, I might use another egg, just to see if that will get it to where it needs to be for me. It's almost there, flavor-wise. It's got the flavor of a croissant. I think it would be perfect with another egg.  NOTE: Watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time.",

I changed the recipe by using dry milk not buttermilk softening the yeast in all of the required water and adding the powdered milk with the flour. I also used canned dry eggs by the same method: the powdered eggs go in with a cup of flour and the necessary liquid is added as water at the beginning. Then I use my Bosch to knead the large amount of dough. The rolls were fluffier than most rolls and browned beautifully. I will make this recipe often. I quadrupled the recipe and sent dozens home with my guests for New Year's Day sandwiches. The rolls were huge and worked for sandwiches and dinner rolls as well. This is a new standard recipe. I think they will roll out well for cinnamon rolls too. I complement the chef. My husband said they were a triumph at our party.",
