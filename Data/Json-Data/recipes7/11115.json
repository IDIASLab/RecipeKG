Due to allergies I haven't eaten tuna since 2007 and was eager to try anything to bring back that taste having tired of chicken. I left out the sugar. A couple of suggestions: start with less oil and then go from there. 1/2 cup renedered a runny outcome. Follow the instructions regarding the process to ensure a perfect texture. Then when getting to the point of adding the chickpeas pickle etc. pulse until you get a rough texture. This gives a bit more bite and flavor than having it too blended. This is really a great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.",

Really convenient as well that I already had most of this in my kitchen, and it\u2019s super easy to follow and it\u2019s pretty similar to the real thing. It\u2019s good for progressive beginners like myself, 100 percent recommend!",
