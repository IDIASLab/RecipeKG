Cut the soy sauce and sesame oil in half. Also with the left over marinade i made a sauce with it and spooned on top of the fish then added sesame seeds. One thing i will add next time is some kind of hot pepper i to like a little heat and found that was the only thing missing. Also next time make sure there's a extra helping.",
