Surprisingly -- it was ok. However, the recipe was really missing something. If I were to make it again, I would cut down on the cheddar cheese a little (even though I'm a cheese LOVER...it was a bit much, and it made the consistency of the spaghetti a little off), use a little less pasta (maybe even half), and add more seasonings -- like garlic, black pepper, etc. I might even try adding about a half a pound of Italian sausage for a little more flavor. Overall, the dish was okay, but it was just a little too bland and boring for the expense of the ingredients. If I make it again, I will tweak it significantly. Thanks for a good base, though.",

I made the pan for my husband and me, and it lasted us almost a whole week. So, just a few tweaks to serve personal taste, and this is a fantastic and filling meal.",

I basically followed the recipe in the beginning, but I ended up adding fresh tomatoes (3 Medium), I doubled the mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers (2 large) because my family and I adore these ingredients, and I added 4-5 cloves of fresh garlic.  I felt a little adventurous and used 1-1/2 lbs of Ground Beef, and approximately 1/2 to 3/4 lbs. of Ground Turkey.  It was a smashing hit!!! \n\nI really enjoyed making this meal because you can experiment and be creative with it.  My adult children came home and brought their friends and significant others to enjoy this recipe (There was plenty!)...\n\nBut what have I done?
