I tried to capture that in my photo.  This was really tasty.  Too much water was used for cooking the rice so I poured it through a colander after 25 minutes and the rice tasted done.  I did use vanilla bean paste in place of the vanilla extract, and, because I had a large serving of vanilla pudding mix, I increased the recipe by half changing the servings to read 9.  I got almost all of it into my 8 inch square baking dish.  I left out about 1/4 cup so I wouldn't spill it putting it in the oven.  When served, I sprinkled with cinnamon.  Hubby says, \"where's the raisins?\"   I told him next time.  There will be a next time.   Thank you KOKO48 for sharing!",

Consistency was perfect dense almost like a bread pudding custard. Second time I made this I added rum-soaked raisins and wow! 6 stars! I have also substituted a package of serve and cook tapioca pudding for the vanilla pudding because that's all I had on hand. I think it will be a permanent change for me! Highly recommend giving this recipe a try!!",
