I love the lemon but I wanted to make these and realized I didn't have any lemons so I used what I did have, grapefruit. They turned out wonderful! I bet they would be good made with oranges too. The glaze is different from your regular iced cookie with the granulated sugar giving a nice texture on top. Yummy!",
