Second time instead of using vegetable juice I used pure tomato juice. Also instead of tomato sauce I used paste. I also added a clove of fresh garlic and a dash of cilantro. I then topped it with mild cheddar cheese and put it in the oven just to melt the cheese. This resulted in a much better finished product and more smiling faces at the dinner table.",

I did leave the tomato sauce out and thought it was plenty \"tomato-y\". Used brown rice which has a 50 minute cook time, so after 30 minutes I nestled the breasts back in the rice, covered again quickly, and cooked an additional 20 minutes, I also added a cup of defrosted peas when adding the chicken back. Left out the sugar and gave gave a generous squeeze of lemon over all when finished. I would definitely make this again! Look forward to the leftovers for lunch! Thank you!",
