Original had 2 2oz bottles of red food color....a little too much. Original frosting contained canned Crisco...and was way too difficult for a commoner like me to make...so I changed to Cream cheese icing but I will try this one. Thanks for the changes...looks like they are all for the good of the finished cake. Applause applause applause!!!",
