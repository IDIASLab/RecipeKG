It's not a big deal, true, but if you follow the recipe as written you have a dough and not a batter. It's more like 2 tablespoons. However,the flavor is wonderful and provided you fry it a slightly deep golden brown, provides a nice crispy crunch. I imagine this batter would be great on a lot of vegetables and will try experimenting!",

Does anyone have any ideas on how to tweak it a little so it doesn't absorb so much? Yes I did put the mushrooms on a wire rack after I took them out of the deep fryer and yes I did wait until the grease was at 350 degrees. Thanks so much.",
