I scaled the recipe down to make a 2 serving recipe to share with 2 of my children that would enjoy this as well as me. It was prefect. At 1st I was not liking the mayo taste but that was before I chilled it in the frig for an hour. After chilling for the amount of time the mayo flavor disappeared and a hint of cinnamon lingered as well as the flavor of the apples. I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe all with a side of bacon.",
