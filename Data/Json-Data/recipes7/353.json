I think the pic got posted to the wrong recipe....there is no chocolate in this recipe. Although now that I think about it chocolate sauce would be nice on top instead of the orange marmalade sauce. Not that the orange marmalade sauce wasn't terrific it was...just that chocolate & oranges go together so well.;o) I cut the recipe in half & cooked it in two larger ramekins for 38 minutes allowed them to cool a bit in the water bath then turned them out onto antique china plates. Don't be too generous w/ the sauce...a little goes a long way. Thanks again Pam!",

                "reviewBody": "A very light (as in not heavy) pudding. I have no idea what instant flour is so I used normal all-purpose flour with 1/2 tsp of baking powder. The batter is very liquidy but not to worry after you add the beaten egg whites and cooks it stiffens up nicely. The flavour is really mild. I didn't have any orange liqueur on hand and I was just trying out this recipe for a dinner we are having this sunday for some elderly people who wouldn't want anything too heavy so I didn't make the sauce. The sauce (and I think an orange sauce to bring out the flavour) is a must.And if you are looking for a mild flavoured not too heavy dessert this fits the bill. By the way the photograph is definteily not of this pudding. There is no base and the pudding has more of soft spongy look as compared to the smooth cheesecake texure. Edit: Made it for the party. Half through the cooking I found that I was out of lime juice so I doubled the orange juice and reduced the quanity of milk by 1/4 cup (so as to keep the amount of liquid same). It turned out just fine - with more of an orange taste (earlier it was an orange - lemon citrusy taste)",

I realized too late and my whites just wouldn't turn into peaks but I folded them in anyway. As well instead of lemon juice I added more orange juice and instead of \"instant flour\" I followed Chandycooks' advice and added 1/2 tsp baking powder to all-purpose flour. Then since I didn't have ramekins I baked the whole thing in a store-bought chocolate pie crust so it would end up looking at least a little like the (very misleading) picture. Mmm chocolate orange = delicious.",
