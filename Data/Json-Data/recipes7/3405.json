I did make one alteration, I used an oreo cookie crust instead of the animal crackers, we're a chocolate loving family.  I just bought a pack of oreos and threw almost a row of them in the food processor to make 1 1/2 cups of oreo crumbs and kept the same amount of everything else for the crust.  I also used special dark cocoa.  Just delicious!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I look forward to making it again.",

It had a light delicate crunch and you could definitely taste the coffee.  The cheesecake itself is like a giant chocolate truffle.  I omitted the nuts from the filling as a personal preference because I like my cheesecakes to have a smooth creamy texture.  My only other admission was the cornstarch.   I bake a lot of cheesecakes and was very leary of the baking instructions.  Not wanting to chance failure, I used my standard baking method for cheesecakes which includes baking in a water bath.   I\u2019ve never had one crack and this one was no exception.  It turned out perfect!",
