I LOVE brocolli and was very happy to find this vegetarian version of it. This recipe works great as listed but since I have made it several times I have tried changing it up. One thing I do is roast the pecans before adding them to the salad and it really improves an already fantastic dish. Also I have been reading a lot about the benefits of chia seeds so I add them in this dish as well and you really can't taste them but I like knowing it ups the nutritional value of the salad. Most recently I used Balsalmic vinegar rather than raspberry and there was a subtle difference. The Balsalmic felt a little more grown up but I tend to feel that way about Balsalmic vs. other vinegars so I could just be biased. Great salad even without any additional modifications though.

I used raspberry vinaigrette dressing with a little apple cider vinegar as I didn't have raspberry vinegar and it worked great. My twelve-year old son really liked it--he had seconds. I'm guessing a large head of fresh broccoli crowns is about the right amount. I didn't measure but it seemed to be the right ratio to dressing. I will definitely make this again soon.",
