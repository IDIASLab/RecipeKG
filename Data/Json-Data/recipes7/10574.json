It is a good thing that I'm about to leave the house too because otherwise I'd sit and eat the whole thing! Well not really because it is very big as you can tell from the amount of the ingredients. This is one of those recipes that looks better each time you make it because it does take practice. I had a difficult time rolling it out to 30x20 but that's my fault because the only thing I did different from the recipe was to use butter rather than Crisco in the dough. I hope the submitter of this gem will post her photo because it is so MUCH better than this one. But I'll keep trying! This is delicious! Now I don't know if I want to give away part of it as planned! Thanks StephaniCCP!",

He did correct me when i called it povititsa because his mother called it (Croatian Orahnjaca). I am not sure who is correct but this is a blast to make. i wanted it be perfect so I googled how to roll the dough and roll it out with an old tablecloth. I don't have a link but there are many videos showing the traditional way to make this. I was impressed with the one loaf I made but watching the professionals they make 18 or more loaves at a time to give as gifts during the holidays. Wow. I do recommend that you chop / grind the walnut mixture until it is is very very fine and that the mixture is spread evenly over the entire dough. Sretno (good luck I think).",

I'm glad I did, because it was really yummy:  not excessively sweet (like cinnamon rolls tend to be), and a great addition to the brunch table.  And what was  left is fabulous toasted on a griddle with a bit of butter!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I substituted pecans for walnuts (because that's what I had on hand) and the grated zest of one lemon for the lemon extract.  Also, so it would be fresh from the oven for breakfast, I completely assembled it the night before and then covered and refrigerated it overnight, removing it from the fridge first thing in the morning and allowing it to rest and come to room temperature for an hour or so before baking.  I will definitely be making this again.",
