I made 8 cups took them to my husband's band gig and they disappeared in 5 minutes. I only made a few changes cos of ingredient situation. I used coconut oil pink himalayan sea salt raw sugar crystals and added cayenne. DELISH! I had the entire dining room table covered with nuts while they were cooling. They did not stick together too much and dried very nicely not sticky at all. Gotta keep stirring while liquid is boiling stay on top of things!",
