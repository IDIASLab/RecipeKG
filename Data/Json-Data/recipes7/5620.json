I make mine like a sheet cake in a swiss roll tin because I don't have a bundt tin. It's a relatively shallow dish so I keep a close eye on the cooking time because it's cooks more quickly. Definitely a favourite in our house and I've been asked for the recipe by friends who've tasted it. I've never made the compote so can't say what that's like but for a party I drizzled melted chocolate over the cake before I cut it up into squares.",
