Even my father-in-law, who usually thinks scones are too dry, loved these.  I'm already planning to make them again next weekend :)",

Granted they're the first but as we're overloaded with wild huckleberries at our house we're always looking for new recipes. I didn't have any fresh lemon or zest so I left the zest out and used my old standby Minute Maid frozen lemon juice concentrate and they turned out fine. I can see how the zest would add another citrus dimension and look forward to doing them exactly as the recipe states soon. My husband took one bite rolled his eyes in happiness and stated \"Killer scones. We won't be giving these away.\"",
