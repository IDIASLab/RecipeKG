I also used only half the salt.  But I think it's really the vinegar/sugar method of cooking that makes the sauce so different from other sauces, so I hope that sets well with the author of this recipe.  I served it last night with some potstickers and today with some chicken.  I'll bet the reviewer who said it didn't thicken didn't wait to write the review because it really does thicken---a lot!  Very yummy!  Thank you!",

I did make a couple of changes to the sauce. I added just a tad bit less of the rice vinegar since vinegar is very strong and only used 1t. of salt. This came out great. Will be using this sauce for dipping egg rolls in a party that I am planning. Will be back to post my comments on what my guest think of this sauce. FYI also used it to dip chicken nuggets with the kids.....thanks for the recipe",
