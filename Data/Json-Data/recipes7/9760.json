While I've tried making many different types of jam in the past, I've always come back to classic plain strawberry as my favorite and it was the only kind I made year after year until now. I had some leftover strawberries and decided to try this recipe out and to my pleasant surprise I like it even better than the plain strawberry.  As I made this at the last minute, I did not add the liqueur or the orange zest simply because I did not have those ingredients on hand. I will be adding this to my yearly canning list, and next time I make it I will add in the zest, but probably not the liqueur just because of the added expense.",
