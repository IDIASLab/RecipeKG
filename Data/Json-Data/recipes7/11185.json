The dough seemed very wet, therefore when I dropped on parchment paper with a cookie scoop, they spread and baked rather flat. Maybe I used too much liquid? The dough needs a pinch of salt.  The scones were very tender and light. Not heavy and dense. The flavors were spot on, however, I'm not sure the pears add any flavor. Next time I will chop them fairly small so as to not have chunks of clear pear falling out of the scone. I will definitely make them again doing the following... 1. Less liquid  2. Add salt to the dough. 3. Chop the pears small. Baking temp and time was right on. Adding a little butter to the warm scones help compensate for the lack of salt in the dough.",

I baked them until golden brown but even after thoroughly cooling they were very soft almost a too-moist cake texture rather than the harder scone texture I was hoping for. I subbed melted coconut oil for the canola and maybe that was the issue? But since I am not a fan of canola oil I don t keep it on hand. I didn t care for the glaze taste and I think some almond or vanilla flavor in both the scone and the glaze could improve it. Appearance: 5 stars. Texture: 2 stars Taste: 3 stars",
