This is a staple in many potlucks, tailgating and family gatherings. Mochiko is a Japanese sweet flour that makes a light batter. I make this for my family of 8 once a month. I have to triple the recipe and there is never leftovers.",

I didn't add the green onion nor the sesame seeds, and it was perfect. Mochiko chicken is a very popular japanese/hawaiian dish, and is often put into bentos (lunches). You could use a little less sugar if you want. Thanks for the recipe!",
