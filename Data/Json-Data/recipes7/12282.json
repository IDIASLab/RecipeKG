                "reviewBody": "I made this dish But I made a few changes. One, I did not use canned beef broth. I made my own the day before using beef marrow bones some vegetables and prepared it in my Dutch Oven at 200 f in my gas oven for 12 hours.\n\nI cut back on the diced tomatoes. It's beef vegetable soup. It should taste like beef and not tomato.  I also skipped the cut green beans and the chilli. \n\nI prefer the focus to be on the beef flavour. I would make that culinary decision even if I hadn't made the beef broth myself. As you can see from the accompanying photo it was a big hit.\n\nIf you have the time, use your dutch oven to make your own broths and stocks. The slow cooking in your oven makes for a more effective extraction of nutrients and flavour. Plus, you won't have all those additives of questionable value.",

I used reduced sodium beef broth and no salt added tomatoes and instead of the second can of tomatoes, I used a 12oz. bottle of V8 juice and it was perfect!!!  It made the perfect amount for leftovers for lunch or dinner again another night.  Love, love, loved it and so did my husband.  We can't wait to make it again!",
