Next time I would just cut back the onions only. I would also probably add more green beans. I used canned and they worked very well with this dressing. I liked the green beans more than the beans. This is a basic and good all purpose recipe for a classic bean salad. I might experiment with other beans also as suggested of a smaller type. I got about 4 servings.",

I am not a fan of canned and fresh is a lot of work for a salad. \n2) In the time of Coronavirus, you have to buy what is available in the store. No wax beans? No problem! No lima beans? No problem! I ended up with green beans, garbanzo beans, and kidney beans, but I think there are a lot of options here. I could not find garbanzo beans at first and I was thinking about trying butter beans. \n3) The dressing is just right. We do not like a lot of dressing and we do not like it too sweet. When you let it set overnight, you do not need much. \n4) Love the added red bell pepper and onion (I used red onion as well.) \n5) it is just so pretty! I have never taken a picture of food before, but I just couldn't help myself. (I think it is because the frozen green beans are just so colorful with the deep reds of the other veggies.\nOne more note- I do not like using part of a can of something (kidney beans) because then I am just stuck with odd left-overs, so I just used the whole can and added a little more of the other beans to balance it out.",
