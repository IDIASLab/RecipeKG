Additionally the layers were sliding around. So what I did was stake the layers with some chop sticks and stuck it in the fridge for a while so the pie filling could harden up. After a while the pie filling stopped being pushed out and that is when I put the meringue on. Took the chop sticks out and stuck it in the oven immediately. I was hoping the meringue would seal the pie filling but it didn't. As soon as it got heated up it was leaking to the bottom of the cake making the cake look like a mess. Will never make this recipe again. The only change I made to the recipe was the meringue. I used a recipe that I use for my pie recipe that uses cornstarch egg whites sugar salt and vanilla extract.",
