Bake time of 1.5 hours is too long for my mold.. My mold pan instructions said 50 minutes and that's what I did. Also a ton of batter left over which I could see before I even started pouring. No need for toothpicks and left out nuts. Despite fluffier cake got it out of mold with only minor issues.",
