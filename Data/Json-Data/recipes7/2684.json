Yummy both ways! The buttery warm polenta enhances the flavor of the eggplant mixture! That and a salad makes a great dinner.\n\nI just had one eggplant at the time, so I used 1 tomato, 1 pepper (red cuz I don't like green peppers), about 1/2 an onion, about 1/2 the sugar & salt, but I didn't reduce the liquids by much. \n\nI will be making this often! I have eggplants in my garden but I've never been a big fan. I am so happy to have found a way to cook them that I love so much!",

We also do use the same recipe but instead of eggplants you can use chicken.",

I am from the former USSR and while in the area I lived we make this dish differently I tried this recipe and it was so much less work than my usual recipe and the flavor was so different even though the ingredients are very similar. I recommend everyone to try it! Really good!!! UPDATE!!! I have found that the longer this sits the better it tastes!!! In fact don't bother eating it the day you make it - you will only be disappointed. Further when I was in a pinch one time I have substituted canned plain tomato sauce (not pasta sauce) for the tomatoes and actually like the tanginess of this version better. I definitely recommend it. I have not stopped making my traditional Russian Eggplant Caviars but this has definitely earned a place on our permanent eggplant rotation.",
