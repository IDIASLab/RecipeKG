I used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2, 2 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar and added a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I also make a  crumb topping( 2/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1 stick softened butter-mix altogether with hand) and sprinkle all over the top of the loaves before baking.

Increased the zucchini to 2.5 cups and ensured that I squeezed the water out of the zucchini by lightly salting it and letting it \"weep\" for 20 minutes or so.  I changed the flour ingredient to: 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil vs 1 cup of oil for a healthier recipe.  On a side note;  to prevent your blueberries from sinking to the bottom of the pan, coat them in flour before adding.  This will help them bind to the batter.  Enjoy!",

I made a half recipe for a standard loaf but there wasn\u2019t enough batter to fill the pan adequately, so I had to sub  with a smaller pan that just didn\u2019t seem right to me.  As it baked it rose unevenly,  with a square, level top, not the nicely rounded top it should have.  After repeatedly checking it for doneness I finally gave up \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to mess with it anymore.  As I turned it out of the pan directly into the garbage can rather than onto a cooling rack,  it somehow finally dawned on me that I forgot to include the zucchini in this Blueberry ZUCCHINI Bread!   So I tried it again.  It was just the right amount of batter for an 8x4\u201d loaf pan.  As it baked it was fragrant and developed a nicely risen, rounded top.  It was moist, with a compact yet tender crumb, chock full of blueberries and pretty specks of zucchini.  It was full of flavor, delightfully sweet with a delicate hint of cinnamon.  It was perfect.  I am not.   Don\u2019t forget the zucchini.",

It yielded a little more than the 2 cups indicated in the recipe. The batter ended up being the proverbial 10 lbs. of stuff in a 5 lb. bag. It rose like the dickins in the oven and overflowed the pan. So... the 4 mini pans don't begin to cover the room needed for this batter. Try using at least 5 if not 6 mini pans. Also, the recipe indicates a \"light\" greasing of the pans is needed. I greased them well and yet two of the loaves stuck to the bottom of the pans. I only used 2 C sugar instead of the 2 1/4 C required by the recipe, and it still was overly sweet. Also, even when it's cut the next day, it doesn't cut well; it easily crumbles.",
