If making standard recipe size (75 servings) I would recommend only 3 cups of sugar and five cinnamon sticks as the cinnamon-sugar flavor is a little overpowering in the original. the liquor content is spot on. I am a heavy drinker and it often takes tons of (straight) rum to get me drunk. just 1-2 servings of this will get you DRUNK. if you are sensitive to the taste of alcohol no worries. If you make this properly you will not taste the alcohol at all. amazing recipe and a total hit at my Christmas parties! thank you!!",
