Half of the dough yields a sugared butter cookie, while the other half is unsugared and topped with a pecan half. This recipe can be easily halved for a smaller yield, but believe me, the cookies disappear quickly. You won't regret making an entire batch because no one can stop eating them. The recipe looks more complicated than it really is. Just be sure not to slice the cookies too thickly.",

If you mix the dough when the kitchen is hot,the dough is less crumbly and easier to mix. I usually mix it after I've spent the first part of the day baking other cookies. Then, when baking the butter cookie, I always do it first in the morning, when the kitchen is cold. Hope this helps.",

After sticking the slices together I ended up with only 21 cookies. They would have been big cookies but I was about to serve them at my Danish grandpa's 98th birthday party. So after cutting them in half to double the batch they still ended up a nice size. After cooling for only a few minutes they were unexpectedly slightly crunchy. I'm still not sure why you have to make two separate \"logs\" and then put the slices together. I'm going to experiment with the next batch and see if they taste the same if I just add a third egg and a little more coarse sugar to all of the dough and just place the pecans on top right before baking. It's too bad this recipe is kind of confusing (88 pecans? Where did that number come from?). But I give it five stars because they taste so delicious. They taste like scones only better. They go great with coffee!! Oh and my Danish Grandpa and relatives loved them too!!",
