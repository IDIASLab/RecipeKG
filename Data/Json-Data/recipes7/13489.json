I mixed the Almond flour in with the coconut and coconut milk and then added the entire mixture to the sauce pan with the melted sugar. make sure you add the coconut mixture to the pot with the sugar do not try to add the sugar to the bowl with the coconut it does not end well. Next time I might try coating them in chocolate before rolling it in coconut or som3how incorporating chocolate",
