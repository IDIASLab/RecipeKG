I did not have self-rising flour so I used all purpose and added 2 tsp baking soda 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. I used vanilla soy milk. The batter was really thick so I added another cup of soy milk. It made a really nice fluffy pancake. I could have probably added another cup of soy milk to thin it out a bit. I never would have thought of using my custard mix for this but it is really good. thanks for the 'eggless' pancake. You made my kids happy!",

I made them the first time using the self-rising flour recipe on this site and they were really awful still -- way too salty. I didn't want to write a review until I tried them again because it didn't seem fair. Made them again this morning w/self-rising flour and they were fantastic! I did have to use 1 1/2 c.(!) additional milk but I guess I just like my batter much thinner. The custard powder is brilliant! (used Dr. Oetker's vanilla pudding as that's what was in the house) I think they're better than regular pancakes. Thank you!",
