The dressing is better if made a day ahead. I made the dressing and added it to the pasta mixture. It was good but the next day after the flavors had time to marry the salad was much better.

Amazing. I am new to the mustard world so I dont know what spicy Dijon is. I did 1 tsp Dijon with Chardonnay and 1 tsp spicy brown. I also used miracle whip as the creamy base. I also made this one day ahead. It may not last until tomorrow!!",

I did modified it....(trying to appease the family)....My hubby doesn't  like mayo, so I did 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayo. I also used a low carb sugar replacement instead of the sugar. Further modifications include dried herbs, not fresh. It was a great dressing, even with the dried herbs, I can't imagine how lovely it would be with fresh herbs. Nice change from ranch. Has almost a creamy greek taste to it.",
