For those not knowing how to achieve a cooked butternut squash, just cut in half lengthwise, brush the insides with olive oil and place the flesh side down on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees for 30-45 min depending on the size until they are fork tender.  Then just scoop out the meat into a bowl and use a potato masher or hand mixer to puree. The texture is just right whether you make quick bread loaves or muffins. Not too dry or crumbly when you bite in.  The ratio of spices was perfect in my opinion. I ended up icing some which hubs enjoyed.  A nice alternative to canned pumpkin.",
