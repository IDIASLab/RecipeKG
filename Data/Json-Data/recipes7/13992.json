I did use Truvia Baking Blend instead of sugar so perhaps that affected the muffin texture. I could taste the coconut a lot more than the chocolate flavor and would consider adding some chocolate chips to the batter if I make this again. Sprinkling some chips on the top did give nice presentation. Cheerios thanks for sharing your recipe.",
