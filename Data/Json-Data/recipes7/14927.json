OMG the house smelled divine!\n\nI also added in half a container of vanilla yogurt for more depth (normally would have done a couple of big spoons of sour cream, but was out).  I used almost all the sugar called for (just did light scoops, not packed, so probably 1/3 c less overall), and it was perfect.  I topped it all with a struesel crumb topping - also perfect!\n\nThis recipe made one 9\"x5\" loaf pan, one 8\"x4\" loaf pan (I only have one of each) and 6 regular muffins (and put walnuts in the smaller loaf - delish!).  I filled each container halfway with batter and had plenty of room - it only rose about an inch leaving an inch room after, so I could have done without the muffins and had taller loaves, but with a new recipe, better to be safe than sorry!",

This turned out very moist, spicy, and pumpkin-y.  Just a tad on the sweet side for us (personal taste preference), so I'll cut back on the sugars next time.  Followed the recipe as written, but I did add some chopped pecans.  This is a very tasty quick bread and certainly measures up well to other pumpkin breads that I've made!",

If you choose to make this recipe, I would suggest swapping the measurements for ginger and cloves, except halve the updated amount of cloves. Also, if you\u2019re making the effort  to remove the oil, why on earth would you use that much sugar? My suggestion would be to reduce the amount of granulated sugar by about 1/4 cup and the amount of dark brown sugar by about 1/2 cup. I probably will not make this again as I have a recipe from a 1970\u2019s church cookbook that is phenomenal.",
