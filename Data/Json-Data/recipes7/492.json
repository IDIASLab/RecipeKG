It's a delicious blend of different tastes and textures. I use buttercup squash, but acorn squash can also be used; Jonathan, Rome or other dry apples work best. It can also be made a day ahead of time--just add the cornflake topping and bake the next day.",

At Thanksgiving I made it with buttercup squash (looks like a smal green & orange pumpkin) but it was VERY difficult to peel even after microwaving for 5min. Probably the easiest way to use the buttercup squash would be to cut in half scoop out seeds bake for about an hour at 350 degrees then scoop out the squash and then prepare as the recipe says. For Christmas I used butternut squash and it was much easier to prepare and just as delicious. I used a mix of apples including macintosh and cut them up into small wedges (not sliced or diced). For topping I used Special K with cinnamon and pecans for the cereal. Lastly I put everything in the crockpot instead of baking and kept on low until ready to eat.",

The only thing I had to change was the topping because my family is not a big fan of any type of nut. I was also out of cornflake cereal so I had to improvise. I used 1 cup of rice crispies 1/2 cup brown sugar (but could have probably used less) and 2 tbsp melted butter. I mixed it all together and sprinkled it on top delicious! My EXTREMELY picky 2 year old even likes it thank you for such a wonderful recipe! I will probably make a big batch for Thanksgiving too:)",

I did however make a few minor additions to the recipe. 1) Added 1 teaspoon of fresh minced ginger to the squash mash along with a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice. 2) Added a generous sprinkling (maybe 1/4 tsp) salt to the cornflake/butter/sugar crunch topping. Delicious! This just moved into definite go-to holiday side dish. Fantastic! Thanks!",
