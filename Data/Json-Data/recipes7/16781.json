I followed the recipe accordingly and followed Chef John's instructions per the video and couldn't be happier with the way these turned out. The instructions were easy to follow and the breaking process matched the results of the video. I will definitely be making these throughout the holidays. I am thinking of dipping these in chocolate for added flare but all is said and done, really happy with this recipe and would definetely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for easy recipes for the holidays.",

My almonds were raw so I roasted them for 15 minutes at 350' to dry roast them before using in the recipe. really good even without coffee but dipping them took them to a whole new level of delicious. Exactly as advertised and easy to make I am going to make my second batch this afternoon in hopes of some making it under the tree... wish me luck.",
