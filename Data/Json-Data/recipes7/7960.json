Once you stop stirring, don't walk away from the stove, watch it VERY closely because mine turned dark amber within 30-45 seconds.  Also, do use a larger pan (as Chef John recommends in his video)  because when it starts to bubble, it climbs up the saucepan.  I could tell from the smell of the smoke that it was well on its way to burning...but it didn't, thankfully.  Will thicken up after refrigeration, giving you a beautiful, rich,  and decadent caramel sauce.",

It is exactly what I've been thinking of since Junior High Foods Class when we learned about the chemical changes taking place in cooking methods of certain foods. While my sons were board with my 'back in day' story they were thrilled to enjoy this caramel sauce over sliced apples after school the other day. This sauce is so versatile! I froze some to make the kids Slo-Pokes for when they got home from school yesterday. Today I am making some pretzels so that they can enjoy the caramel that way as well. Oh and with my 1/2cup of Birthday Bash ice cream last night the caramel was the BEST part of the Bash. Yes it is very tasty on apples but I'm not one for limits in the kitchen.",
