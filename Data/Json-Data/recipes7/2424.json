The idea behind it is fantastic, but the subtle sweetness of squash is what makes it a summertime favorite and the amount of sugar in this recipe blankets that natural sweetness in the squash with an overwhelming sweetness that makes this dish almost a dessert as is.  If you half or quarter the amount of sugar and maybe replace it with a little cornmeal, this fried squash is simple and amazing.  This way the sugar carmelizes and accentuates the squash rather than candy coating it.",
