I altered the recipe to make it crock pot compatible by only using 1 qt. of chicken stock and I subbed Trader Joe's Jalapeno Chicken Sausage for the elk. I also used apple cider vinegar and ginger paste. I got a little too liberal with the hot sauce and my preschooler refused to eat it. Cooked on high for 4 hours and then turned it on low for 3 and it was fantastic. I used a few more veggies (whole head of cabbage 3 beets 3-4c. squash) because I was trying to unload a bunch of veggies. I also skipped the cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have any on hand (but i did add some leftover cream of tomato soup towards the end). I thought it was very tasty stick-to-the-ribs fair but with the hot sauce and the jalapeno chicken sausage too spicy for little ones (although I loved it!)",
