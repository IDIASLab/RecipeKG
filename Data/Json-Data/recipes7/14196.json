My jalape\u00f1os were very hot so I made this awesomely delicious dip for those of us who can take the heat. I used mild green chili's for those that can't handle the heat. I made up the dip at home and baked it and then put it in two dip size crock-pots. I also think this would make a wonderful filling stuffed in a chicken breast. A dip I will MOST definitely be making again.",

I would partially thaw them out on a paper towel to get rid of the moisture. I would mix mild cheddar with the American; I would be generous on the jalapenos. It is a really interesting dip because the jalapeno builds in your mouth after you are finished with your bite. I have a cranberry loving friend who is going to use it for Thanksgiving. I will make this again.",
