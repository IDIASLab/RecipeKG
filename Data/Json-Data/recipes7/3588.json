However with preparing the vegetables I added some things for more flavor: Mushrooms I sauteed them with 1 tsp vegetable oil 2tsp soysauce and 2tsp sugar and some sesame oil. Bean sprouts I cooked them in a pot with a cup of water with 1tsp of salt for 20 minutes then mixed it with 1 clove minced garlic sesame oil and a pinch of salt. Spinach:I boiled it for a minute as per the recipe then added a pinch of salt 1 tsp soysauce 1 clove mince garlic and sesame oil. Zucchini and carrots: sprinkled with salt and sauted for a few minutes separately. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I scaled it down to four and made as directed (even the raw egg which my husband insisted on). It was great but way too sweet. Once we added a spoon full of kuchujang to each of our bowls it was perfect. My husband has requested me to make it again. Next time I'll reduce the marinade a little so it's not overly sweet and my kids can eat it without the kochujang. Also skip the drizzle of sesame oil on the finished product (doesn't need it).",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I did modify it a little decreasing the sugar by half (using 1/4 C sugar and 1/4 C honey). Still it was plenty sweet. I also omitted several ingredients I did not have such as cucumber carrot and sesame seeds. Also on one serving I attempted the raw egg feat but it didn't cook into the meal like I had expected so the whole bowl of food became slippery from the egg. On other servings I simply fried the egg on one side then inverted it onto the food. Much better in my opinion! I only had 1 lb. meat so I used that. I substituted habanero hot sauce for the chili sauce as well. Additionally the only oil I used was a small bit to oil the dishes and a small bit for frying eggs spinach sprouts etc. I did not pour any over the finished dish. Note: To get the rice to sizzle I had to put the rice in immediately after oiling the bowl (I used Pyrex bowls.) When I oiled more than one bowl at a time before adding rice the rice didn't sizzle. So don't let those oiled bowls sit if you want the sizzle.:) The way I made it I probably give it a four and a half. If I'd had the other ingredients on hand I think that would have pushed this recipe into 5-star territory. Hence the rating.",
