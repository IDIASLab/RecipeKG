Not sure exactly why the roll-ups need to be frozen (maybe keeps the filling from oozing out?), but I froze them overnight.  Must say it was nice this morning just to pull them out of the freezer and into the oven.  These rolls are just crisp enough that you can hold them and eat, no fork necessary.   They\u2019re not overly sweet, and although I ate them hot, I think they\u2019d be equally good at room temperature or even chilled.  They'd be a terrific addition to a brunch buffet.  Thanks jessnay for a quick and tasty breakfast today!",
