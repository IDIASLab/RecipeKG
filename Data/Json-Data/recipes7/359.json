        "description": "Dessert is individual molten chocolate cakes. They're simple and elegant, and they bake in under 10 minutes in a standard muffin pan. The best part about these little beauties is that the cake batter is extremely forgiving: You can make it up to six hours before you plan to serve the cakes. Fill the pans with batter and refrigerate, but remember to remove the pan far enough in advance of baking to let the batter return to room temperature. Because they bake for only 8 to 10 minutes, pop these little cakes into the oven as you're clearing the main course dishes and making coffee.",

We've both had our share of Molten Lava Cakes in fine restaurants all over the country. And so you understand the significance then when hubby said these were as fine as we've had anywhere. But you do get out of these what you put into them so use good quality chocolate not chocolate chips--I used Scharffen Berger. Chocolatey rich and delicious perfectly moist and cakey on the outside gooey and \"molten\" on the inside. I made these in 6 oz. buttered ramekins and served with homemade raspberry sauce. A definite make again. BIG pay off for very little effort!",

This was more like an over-coagulated chocolate type pudding. I wish the description had been more accurate. Not only was I disappointed but it tasted strange. Maybe because I expected cake? I'll never make this again!",
