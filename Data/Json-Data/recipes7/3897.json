But this is a good idea if you have to use corn from a can; drain about half the liquid add a couple pats of butter a tsp. or so (to taste) of sugar and a dash of salt. Simmer while you get the rest of the meal together serve. Makes canned corn pretty tasty!",

I scaled it to 2 servings and I added only half the salt but all of the sugar (we don't have sweet corn here in Socal this time of year if ever!). I was hoping it would be like creamed corn and it was in texture. If I make it again I would reduce the sugar to 1/4 and leave the salt at 1/2. But it was good and it lives up to its name. It may be a good jumping off point for other additions--like minced sweet red peppers or something. I love the idea of this so I'll play with it!",

For the most part the additions just bring out the flavor of the corn. The only thing was the salt. It was bearable for me because I like salt so much but I would cut it by half first then go up from there. I didn't miss the butter in this recipe at all. A healthier version of fresh corn on the cob or a nice recipe for canned corn. Will make again. Thanks Nathan!",
