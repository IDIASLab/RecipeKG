Didn't have turnip or sweet potato- so I used 1 regular potato.   And so many of the squash recipes called for cream cheese.  I put some in a bowl & tasted it & it was great.  I put about 3 oz. of cheese in the soup.  Using an immersion blender made it so creamy.  going to freeze half for later this winter.",

This is so smooth and creamy and was very satisfying on a cold day. It's hard to believe that there is no milk or cream in it! I enjoyed this with caesar croutons instead of the usual crackers. I'll definitely make this again! Thanks Connor!",

The natural sweetness from the sweet potato and butternut squash add another layer of flavor and the turnip really comes through without being overpowering. I only had to cook the soup for about 30 mins before everything was soft enough to blend. All I needed to add at the end was additional salt. It's super creamy and you would would think milk or cream was added. Delicious. This makes 4 huge servings - you could even stretch this to 6.",
