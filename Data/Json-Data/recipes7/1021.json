I also added fresh mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes (drained). I used rigatoni instead of shells because thats all I had. I also only used 1/4 cup of sugar due to what others had stated. I simmered it for 1 hr like the recipe said and it turned out wonderful! Iadded low fat parm cheese and that topped it off!!! Great dish I will make again!! PS this dish is just as good the next day!

Served over whole wheat pasta shells. Next time I want to try a little more \"cheesy\" some mozzarella and extra Romano. Thanks for the recipe I will definitely make this again!",
