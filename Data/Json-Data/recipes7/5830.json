Although I did not change the recipe any, I did use an apple corer to core the pears (easier in my opinion). This also sliced them. One thing I would recommend though is use either less sugar or unsweetened orange juice. Otherwise it will be very sweet. All in all, a wonderful treat.",

I was also skeptical about the amount of vanilla extract - I've never used a recipe that called for TABLESPOONS rather than teaspoons of vanilla. So I used half quantity but on tasting the juice decided to add the other half. What a difference it made! The extra vanilla really balanced the cinammon. I would recommend preparing the recipe the night before serving because the pear flavor really comes through. If you are a ginger lover add some chopped crystallized ginger. It really complements the other flavors. Definitely a winning recipe!",
