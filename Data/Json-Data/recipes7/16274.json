I subbed vanilla extract for half the recipe amount of almond extract (I was out of vanilla) and it is overpowering with the almond extract - but not to the point where I won\u2019t drink it. I gave this recipe 5 stars because despite the almond extant disappointment I can tell that this is going to be a wonderful drink once I get more vanilla. I will likely reduce the amount of vanilla called for in the recipe - probably by half and adjust from there for flavor. Overall, I love this drink and can\u2019t wait to try it according to the recipe ingredients!!",
