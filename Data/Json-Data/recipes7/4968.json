I was glad to see that the author of the recipe doesn't blanch the peas because I would not have either. I forgot to get the parsley so that wasn't included in my version and I did get a little heavy handed on the onions garlic and almonds. My sister who sends me the wild rice from Wisconsin will love this recipe! Thank you very much! EDIT: I tasted this several hours into refrigeration and I think what happened is that the rice soaked up all the lovely dressing. So I made more and added it just before serving it. And now I even have a bit of that left over for another purpose! Yum!",
