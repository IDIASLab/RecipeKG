(Just think which is better boiled chicken or grilled chicken?) I still gave this 4 stars because the spice mixture is great but as a rule if you want flavor you should not cook meat in water. Another tip is to sear all sides of the meat before placing it in the crock pot which will seal in the juices and add that great classic darkened BBQ caramelized delicious outer layer which adds texture and quality to your meat. Otherwise you risk getting a mushy canned meat texture.",

I rarely measure things! Seasonings were up\u2019d too. I cooked this in Apple Juice instead of water, per another reviewer. I filled my slow cooker with Apple juice until it was 3/4 of the way up the 4.5 lb. roast. Fat side up and packed in Brown Sugar! I wanted it to melt into the meat! I chopped a sweet onion & put that in the bottom of the pot. That was a nice addition. My Crock Pot runs HOT so I cooked it on high for one hour and 7 + more hours on low. I also used a slow cooker liner for easier clean up! I didn\u2019t use the whole jar of BBQ Sauce. It was more like a good cup? I added some of the juice from the slow cooker to moisten the whole thing. Probably the best Pulled Pork I\u2019ve ever made! Thanks for the great base of a recipe!",

Scored a pork loin then added rub all over wrapped it in plastic wrap and let it sit in the frig for 24 hours then browned it on all sides in a pan on the stove before placing in the crock pot covered with sparkling apple cider to cook on high 6 hours. Shredded but put barbecue sauce on the side because it tasted so good straight out of the crock pot. Thank you so much for the recipe! It is a keeper!
