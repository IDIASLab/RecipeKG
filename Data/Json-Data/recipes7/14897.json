Then mixed all of the apple slices in a bowl to coat them well.   I cut back about 1/4 cup of the sugar on the topping.  It was made the night before Thanksgiving, I removed the cobbler form the over when the top was light gold so that it wouls not overly brown during the reheating the next day.  350 degrees for 25 minutes.  The top is almost like a cookie, crisp and a great counter to the apples.  There were 5 desserts for the crowd and this one was the big hit.  So much easier than baking  pies, I will make this often.",
