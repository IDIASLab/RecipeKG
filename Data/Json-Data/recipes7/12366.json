I went by the recipe (because I have no experience with butternut squash and would expect a recipe like this to be for newbies and experienced cooks alike) and did an hour in the oven. My husband and I had to wrestle it out of the shell and then it wouldn\u2019t mush the way it\u2019s supposed to when we used beaters on a high setting. BECAUSE IT NEEDED MORE TIME IN THE OVEN! The recipe needs to be modified before it has such high ratings, there\u2019s no way anybody ever had success after only one hour of it in the oven. We still ate it, as chunky as it was, but I should also mention we don\u2019t have apple pie seasoning (not a common house hold spice but whatever) so I just did a dash of ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. It tasted pretty good, but really I can only give the author of the recipe credit for the amount of butter and brown sugar we used.",
