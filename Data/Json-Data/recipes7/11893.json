I did add a bit more cornstarch as I wanted it more like a light cream rather than a runny sauce but keep in mind that it will thicken somewhat as it chills. This had no lumps was very smooth and creamy so I didn t feel the necessity to pour it through a sieve. Today just spooned it over some fresh strawberries and it was simply divine! Thanks Northstar this is a nice alternative to whipped cream and it really does add a touch of elegance to sliced fresh fruit served in a martini glass!",
