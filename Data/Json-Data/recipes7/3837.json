To be honest, I've never really had blue cheese before.  I skipped putting the last 1/4 cup of Italian crumbs over the top because what was mixed in there seemed like enough.  (I had a smaller squash.)  About three-fourths through baking, I stirred the squash and mashed it down.  It was pretty good.  It tasted just fine.  And it tasted like it had a little bit of stuffing mixed in. I couldn't taste the mozzerella.  Thanks for the recipe.  I always like experimenting with different ways to make vegetables.  Next time I'll buy some blue cheese and give it a try.  And maybe a little extra olive oil for the bottom of the baking dish.  ",
