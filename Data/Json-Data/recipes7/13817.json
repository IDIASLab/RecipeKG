In my initial batch, I had pre-made vanilla sugar to use, and I also added in cinnamon and ground cloves, plus probably a bit more cayenne. It was fabulous!  Very gourmet and with a flavor more like Mexican or South American spiced hot chocolate, and I'd recommend these additions if you enjoy that taste. The more traditional American/Swiss Missers in the house did not agree, even with the deep chocolate flavor in general, and since we were making for extended family gifts, I decided to go with that opinion. I ended up adding MUCH more sugar via adding a nearly equal amount of confectioners sugar to lighten up the chocolate (as I'd seen in other more traditional recipes the use of even primarily confectioners sugar) , and basically drown out the spices. With that alteration of essentially doubling the sugar (eek!), my son rated it 10/10.  Since I loved the recipe though the deep chocolate, less sweet original flavor does not appeal to all palates, rated a 4/5. Thanks for the recipe and inspiration!",
