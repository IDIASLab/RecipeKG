I like the sort of custardy texture of the inside, and the crispy/chewy edges and corners. I've seen another recipe that uses baking soda, but I think that can't be right, since there isn't an acid in the recipe for it to react with. This one has all the right proportions for a tasty cake. It rises pretty high, and mine was completely cooked in 55 minutes, and very evenly browned over the top. I really recommend this recipe and this cake.",
