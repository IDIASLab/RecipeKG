This recipe fit the bill perfectly, and it tasted really good too.\nWay to go Surja! We will be making this again. Only changes will be halving the sugar in half and greatly increasing the dried cranberries. \nVery easy and quick to make. Make sure the Kale is dried off very well.\n",

We didn't have enough kale so used half kale and half mustard greens raisins instead of cranberries and we forgot(!) the sugar but the final dish didn't seem to care. I don't understand though how to boil down the 1 1/2 cup chicken stock without overcooking the greens--we ended up removing the greens and cooking down the broth separately. Still very tasty!",

It was more sweet than savory but that was probably due to the honey mustard I had to use. We had it with a small amount of thinly sliced steak on top but it would have been enough without the meat. This recipe probably would not be for someone who gets grossed out by wilted greens but kale remains quite crunchy even when wilted so we found it very satisfying. The cranberries and almonds really add to it. I think the only way you could mess this up would be if you cooked the kale too long.",
