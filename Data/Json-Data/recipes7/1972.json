The soup is very good - I used lean ground pork and only 1 egg in the meatballs and followed the suggestions of others and added sliced rehydrated dried Chinese mushrooms tofu and dried shrimp in during the initial phase of cooking and then cracked in a salted duck egg (chopped the yolk up first as it was hard) after I added the meatballs. Just before serving I stirred in 3 sliced green onions. Everyone thought it was delicious though I agree with a previous reviewer that it might be a tad too salty. Next time I will try adding chopped water chestnuts to the meatball mixture to add crunch. I found that the meatballs themselves were very very soft and somewhat hard to form - any suggestions on how to make firmer meatballs?",

The broth is missing some complexity of flavour however and I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps next time I will try adding some dried mini shrimp and crack a salted duck egg into the broth. Since I like \"stuff\" in my soup I also added some cubed medium-firm tofu during the last couple minutes of cooking. This was a very healthy meal. Thanks again!",

So thinking of what I would do with this I went on this website and found this website. i had all of the ingredients and it was very simple to make. I was still afraid about how this would come out because of the cucumber smell and taste of the squash. But I love this! It is absolutely delicious. I recommend it to everyone even if you don't like cucumber because it ends up tasting like potatoes and broth with meatballs. I will probably make this again with my other half of my melon.",

I changed the recipe slightly by substituting the cilantro with minced green onion omitted sugar from both the meat balls and the soup and omitted garlic from meat balls. I also added Chinese soup bouillon (do not use American soup stock because they use different spices) and sake in the soup to add more taste added sliced fresh Shiitake and frozen taro potatoes (satoimo in Japanese) in the soup. The result was delicious. My son who does not usually like vegetables (if Winter Melon is considered a vegetable) ate two servings. I boiled the cut Winter Melon and the frozen taro potatoes for 10 - 15 minutes and drained the water before putting them in the soup stock because I like softer melon and potatoes. I will definitely make this soup again.",
