Hoisin has a lot of salt already so if you're using the sauce in the recipe I don't think I'd bother adding salt to the meatballs. It makes it really salty. Or maybe cut back on the soy sauce.",

I did not have any ground pork and used all beef. Also left out green onions as I had none. A great way to add veggies in disguise!",
