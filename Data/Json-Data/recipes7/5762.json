Anything left in the dish at the end of the meal always goes home with soneone at the picnic. I have to make a double batch so the grandkids will have some to eat at home. This is a very forgiving recipe. You can use any vegetables you like. I have used cauliflower asparagus purple onions jack cheese and hotter peppers. I always try to use what is in season and freshest and this salad is always always a hit. The grandkids even use it as a snack after school. What more can you ask?",
