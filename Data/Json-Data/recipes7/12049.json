I usually just put all of the ingredients in a large cast iron skillet and mix it well with a wooden spoon and then bake to crisp spicy sweet perfection! As other reviewers have also mentioned, I usually add a light sprinkle of cayenne pepper because I like spice but the recipe is great as is! I think I will try this with chopped sweet potatoes soon!

I used a sheet pan without a lip.  Honey and olive oil spilled across the bottom of your oven will quickly turn it into a smoker - - in a bad way.  Yep.  Tin foil lined pan with edges turned up would also work.  Brilliant ideas I came up with a couple of minutes too late. \u201cHey Dad, is something burning?\u201d  Haha",
