Like others had suggested, I added vanilla, and allspice, and finally, sprinkled the topping with brown sugar.  It took about 45 minutes to bake; top had a very thin crunchy layer but airy cake under it.  My plums were small, and tart;  I used15 of them, due to their smaller size. The finished product was a good blend of a tart fruit bottom and sweet cakey top. Definitely plan to serve this with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or even a mild pouring custard; you'll find it far more delightful that way!  It kept well for two days, but then put it, covered, in the fridge, and it went downhill within 10 hours: got a bit mushy and too moist.   Will make it again when I have too many plums, nectarines, or peaches, and will add more allspice to the fruit before putting on the topping layer.",
