We had this for Mother's Day (in March in the UK) dessert still warm with whipped cream. Many Thanks",

The sugar and butter drizzle at the end is a little much so I just cut it in half and it was still very tasty. 8 apples is subjective based on the size of your apple. I cut peeled and cored 8 apples and ended up using about 5. Also baking time took more like 45 minutes. This recipe reminds me of what my grandma used to make. Thumbs way up!",

She referred to it as \"possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.\" I substituted currants for the raisins and added a little lemon juice to the apples. The first time I used this recipe I had trouble getting them out of the pans. We ended up just slicing it in the pan like a pie but it probably would have been prettier had I been able to get them out. I tried this again in cupcake tins to make more individualized portions and they turned out really well! I made 24 total and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes.",
