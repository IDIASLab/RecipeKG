There is a simple trick to making them though.  I use a candy thermometer and cook the sugar, cinnamon, and water mixture to the \"soft ball\" stage, approximately 238 degrees.  Then I add the nuts (I use about 3 cups of any kind of nuts I happen to have on hand), and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture starts to lose it \"shine\". (It will look almost \"dull\") Immediately pour onto a waxed paper lined cookie sheet. My mother used to add nutmeg and cloves to her spiced walnuts.

When they're cool toss them with warm melted bittersweet chocolate and then into a bowl of unsweetened cocoa powder. They should have a hard sugar coating topped with a hint of chocolate and cocoa.
