I don't like nutmeg or apple pie spice - I'm strictly all about brown sugar and cinnamon when it comes to baking with apples.  I know, I'm probably not normal but I like keeping things simple.  BTW - this is no means a simple tasting pie!  It's delish, no need to add lemon or orange essence (really, who does that to apple pie?) nutmeg or flour. And how simple was it to make by making a syrup and pouring on the pie?  Can't get easier than that.  The only thing that was hard was peeling the apples and slicing them. Even the hubs liked it considering he's not a an apple pie lover.  Don't change a thing, kudos to Chef John!",

But there was no \"gooey caramel\", just sauce the consistency of broth. Possibly boiling longer would help. Even after 15 extra minutes of cooking, the bottom crust was not done. Too many apples that didn't hold any semblance to pie. It looked great before cutting, and once I made some penuche and poured over the top, it served up like an apple crisp.",
