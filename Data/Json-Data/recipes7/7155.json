With a big patch of rhubarb I was getting tired of pies and jams and thought I would give this recipe a try. I didn't use the smoke and used paprika rather than chipotle because it was what i had. It's so good my husband went out and bought chicken to BBQ so he could use the sauce. (I just caught him dipping his fingers in the sauce:-)",

This is totally going to be an old favorite. I did not have Dr pepper or Worcestershire sauce on hand so I used a can of Pepsi and red wine vinegar instead. Delicious! Tangy but not overpowering. Excellent on pulled pork sandwiches. I must stop at the store tonight to pick up some more rhubarb as well as the correct indigents to make more of this wonderful sauce for canning and use throughout the summer. Thank you so much for a completely different use and way of looking at the pie plant.",
