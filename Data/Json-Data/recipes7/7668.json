The 'crust' reminds me of an oatmeal cookie, which I love, and that flavor made sense with the cherries.  I did change the extract to almond, since I like almond extract with cherries.  I will try this next with peaches, and then I will use the vanilla, and will add some spices.  This will be my 'pie' recipe this year!",

I asked on the buzz and Janet Shum suggested this to me. What a superb suggestion and so easy to make too! I happened to have only 3 cups of pitted cherries on hand but made no changes to the measurements for the crust/syrup. Although I did cut the sugar for the syrup by half. And when pouring the syrup over the cherries I spooned the syrup over so that I could gauge whether it was getting too soggy or not. I had about 1/3 cup left of the syrup that I didn't use for fear of it being too liquidy. I baked this for about 35minutes. The proportions and instructions are perfect and simple to follow. We tend to prefer our desserts a little less sweet so cutting the sugar in the syrup was perfect for us. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar to half cup too. We loved the crust! Such an innovative spin! Thank you luvs2cook for this recipe and thank you Janet for suggesting it to me! Oh and I must add we had these without ice cream coz we were out of ice cream. I imagine these would be divine with ice cream!!",
