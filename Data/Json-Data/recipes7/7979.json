My one recommendation is that if you don't like a lot of ginger pulp filter it with cheesecloth or something finer than your average mesh strainer.

The ginger adds a lot of \"warmth\" which is great but some people refused to stir before serving themselves and the sediment at the bottom made the last few glasses a little overpowering. I for one am glad that we found this recipe. When I make this again I will follow my own suggestion and am sure that it will merit five stars...",
