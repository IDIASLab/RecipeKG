The only change I made was to add 2 pods of garlic when I was cooking the tomatoes--Hey, Italian girl needs her garlic--LOL!  It was so good! I'm not anywhere near being vegetarian, but I do like a meatless meal a couple of times a week, so this will be an easy go-to meal when hubby wants meat and I don't. Thanks!",
