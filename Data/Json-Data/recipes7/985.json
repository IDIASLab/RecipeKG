I didn't have salad shrimp so I used large raw shrimp that I cute into smaller pieces and and cooked in a skillet with Earth Balance and fresh lemon juice. For the crab I used Johan it's what I had. I used farfalle pasta as it makes a prettier presentation. The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it lacks flavour it needs something bright to lift the ingredients to the next level.",
