I changed the recipe drastically.  First, I used 7 teabags instead of 4, used 1 qt of water instead of 2 qts.  The cup of sugar to 1 cup water was too sweet so I used more lemon juice to my taste.  I did use  1 cup of orange juice.  The color of the tea was still very pale and not strong, though it did taste good - more orange flavored than tea flavor. I have a tip for all you tea-drinkers out there.  To keep your tea from getting cloudy add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda to the water while steeping the tea.  You should make 2qts of tea for this amount of soda.  It neutralizes the tannic acid which makes your tea cloudy.",
