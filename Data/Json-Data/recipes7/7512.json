I also did not have mexican vanilla I used a tablespoon of regular pure vanilla extract because that was all I had. I honestly did not have time to babysit it because I threw everything into the crockpot tossed the ingredients together and put the lid on it and crossed my fingers that it would cook just fine while I was at work. When I got home from work my kids and I were overwhelmed with the smell of awesome. I did remove the cover and cooked an additional 45 minutes then I just dumped the apple butter into my food processor and pureed it until smooth. We had this spread on homemade yeast waffles this morning--oh. em. gee. This is AH-mazing. For real. Even without me here to babysit it still turned out perfect. I'll use this recipe again. VERY impressed.",
