As it was I reduced the sugar by 1 cup used unsweetened coconut didn't add the chocolate chips and added 3/4 cup toasted pecans and didn't put the topping on afterward. It was still almost inedible except with a strong cup of coffee. The flavor was good (especially with the addition of the nuts) but I suspect 1.5-2 cups of sugar would be plenty. If you're going to add the chocolate chips I wouldn't put that many and I'd try to use dark ones to cut down on the sweetness. They are nice and gooey however.",

I had my doubts when I took it out of the oven and sprinkled the coconut on. It scattered and didn't adhere to the dry surface. But then when I drizzled the caramel and chocolate it melded into a delicious topping that adhered well. Very delicious and rich great recipe!",
