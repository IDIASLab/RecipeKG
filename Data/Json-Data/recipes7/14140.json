I used Pamela\u2019s baking mix for the flour so did not need to add any extra baking soda. It turned out excellent. Used a combination of coconut palm sugar and a little monk fruit sugar for the one cup of sugar. It made the edges crunchy and caramelized and low glycemic too. \nUsed 3 stalks of rhubarb. And 1 TBS vanilla.\nThanks",

I had some doubts about how much rhubarb was in 3 stalks so  I used 3 cups of of Rhubarb.  The rest of the recipe I left unchanged.  I did have to mix the batter with my hands because it was so stiff.  It is more like a biscuit dough.  it really didn't rise at all and the biscuit got nice and crispy. The dough has no sugar in it but, the cooked rhubarb is a nice sweet contrast.  Served it with a bit of sweet whipped cream.",
