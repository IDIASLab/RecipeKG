Next thing I know, she has hacked down the entire plant and has brought about 30 lbs of rhubarb to my doorstep.  Needless to say, I started searching for recipes.  I stumbled upon this one, which seemed perfect for the dinner party for 4 we were having.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe called for, even though I struggled in my mind with \"Is one cup of halved strawberries REALLY enough?\"  This recipe is flat-out DELICIOUS!  Tangy with the perfect amount of sweetness.  Lemony zesty without lemony overkill.  The four of us completely demolished the 9x9 pan I baked it in.  Thank goodness I still have about 25 lbs of rhubarb left from the neighbor!  I will definitely make this again...as in probably today!\n\nAddendum:  I have found this to be a solid crisp recipe, even if you don't have enough to rhubarb.  I find as long as you use 5-6 cups of various fruits ( rhubarb, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, apples, etc) the rest of the recipe remains exactly the same.  And totally delicious!",

So this was a good compromise; they are also fans of oatmeal topping, which make this perfect.\n\nI did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the liquid; fresh strawberries and rhubarb are too juicy otherwise, even though the flour from the topping does settle down in and help thicken the juices a bit.  \n\nThe flavor was very nice, a humble oaty sweet topping with the sweet-tart fruit underneath.  The lemon zest gave a nice zing that set this apart; I bet you could skip the lemon and also cut the sugar a bit, which I might be tempted to do anyway.
