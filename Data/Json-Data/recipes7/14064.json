In an effort to get calories down, I used skim milk and Truvia\u00ae Baking Blend in place of sugar, and it still turned out awesome!  If you want your butter to melt quickly in the microwaved milk, I\u2019d recommend cutting it into small pieces or grating it.  For a nicer presentation, I cut into rounds using a biscuit cutter.  The texture is light, almost fluffy, it had just the right amount of sweetness, and it soaked up the juice beautifully.  As soon as peaches come into season (very soon), this will be made again.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, used an 8x6x2 baking dish, and  ended up with six round cakes that split horizontally were just about perfect for layering berries in the center.  I\u2019ve always made the biscuit-type shortcake, but this just might become my go-to recipe for shortcake.  LOONEYPROFESSOR thanks sharing Mom's recipe, it's a winner!",

Well the end result was a perfect sponge cake with strawberries AND eaten plain later. In fact it was perfect by itself.

After reading the reviews, I used 1/2 cup less sugar. i followed the directions otherwise, baking it about 30 minutes, which probably could have been cut down a minute or two. It rose beautifully and came out golden brown. Taste wise, it was light, fluffy, and plenty sweet with sugared berries and whipped cream. Next time I make it, I may add more vanilla because I just love vanilla. There will be a next time because I can see having this with any kind of berry or fruit, or with chocolate or caramel sauce, or anything you want to top it with. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",
