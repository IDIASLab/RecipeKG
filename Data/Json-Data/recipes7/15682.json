In the end I had to scoop out about a cup and a half of batter, and even then it still puffed up above the line of the pan. The rising may have been my fault, but it was still definitely too much batter for one cheesecake. Also, I'm not sure the lemon was strong enough to come through for the taste. Strawberry pie filling made an amazing touch, though!",
