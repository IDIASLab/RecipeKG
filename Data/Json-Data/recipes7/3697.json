I added sugar cinnamon and flour to the blackberries and I'm glad I did so bc they can be tart and the additions balanced out the blackberry flavor for me. The bread is really really sticky and I ended up making 2 braids instead of 3; I just didn't feel there was enough filling although I'm sure there'd have been enough bread to do so. So I'd double the filling next time use a tad more flour (although moisture in bread is variable so the stickiness could change depending on the moisture in the air) and maybe top the bread with cinnamon or sugar or both. All in all nice presentation fun to make and a good potentially great recipe. Thanks for the recipe!",
