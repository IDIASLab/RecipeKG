I used blue cheese as called for my husband and I used cheddar for me because I do not like blue cheese. Any cheese of your choice would work good in here. The only deli turkey meat I could find was very thin so next time I will use chicken so that I will have a thicker chunk of meat. All in all good recipe and one I will make again.",
