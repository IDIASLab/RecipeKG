I've made something similar in the past, only I'd make a Chocolate Irish Cream Frosting and while I do think it's good, I have to say this frosting is better!  Nice contrast between the light frosting and the dark chocolate brownie. It is a lovely frosting, buttery, fluffy and with just a hint of the Irish cream. I also like the idea of the sprinkling of toffee bits, for which I used crushed Heath bars instead.  This is, overall, creative and delicious but the frosting, in particular, shines. I plan to remember this one and use it to frost a layer cake in the future!",

Next time I will make half the frosting because you only need to skim the top of the brownies to enjoy the taste of the frosting as using the full amount was too sweet for me. I also substituted Kahlua for the brewed coffee in the frosting. After I brought the Irish Cream liquor, milk, and Kahlua to a boil in my microwave, I put in fridge to cool and thicken. I did not have a problem with runny frosting at all. It was the perfect consistency. I used a potato peeler and a Hershey bar to make chocolate curls on top. Will make again and again!!",

They were in for the recommended 30 min and the texture was off.  So next time I did a 9X9 pan and only had them in for 25 min.  Much better!  With the smaller pan size I also only needed half as much frosting.  In the frosting I reduced the sugar by half.",

I made my own brownies that everyone loves instead of a box mix but added the Irish creme liquor. Then made the frosting exactly as you are supposed to but just tasted like regular buttercream. I even added extra Irish creme but still nothing. I won't be trying these again.",
