Sweet and tart all at the same time. Also delicious on ice cream, pound cake, pancakes, Greek yogurt... The options are endless! It's the taste of summer for our family! Keeps up to 3 days in the fridge.",

I sprinkled 1/4 cup organic white sugar over them and added 2 tsp of almond extract. I warmed the mixture and stirred in the mixture of 2TBS of corn starch and 2TBS cold water. I heated the mixture over medium heat until reaching a boil. I boiled 1 minute and set them in a bowl to cool. Fantastic over ice cream",
