I only had frozen raspberries, 3 dried apricots, and vanilla Greek yogurt, so that is what I used. To puree the raspberries, and their seeds, I first blended them in 1/4 cup of water. I then added the apricots, blended them thoroughly, and then added the rest. My only change at that point was cutting the honey amount in half due to using sweetened vanilla vs. plain unsweetened yogurt. I don't care for lemon juice, in smoothies, so I left that out. I am glad, because the smoothie already had a slight tart like bite.",
