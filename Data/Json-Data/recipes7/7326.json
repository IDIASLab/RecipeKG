I read the reviews and found the comment tip about leaving the pie in the oven for an hour after you turn it off and it really made a huge difference. Nice firm pie and very tasty already have requests to make it again. I did a crumb topping as well.",

I substituted 2 T of cornstarch and it did not get thick at all.  After looking at a peach pie recipe with the same amount of sugar, I think I will increase the cornstarch to 1/4 c. next time and that probably will do the trick. I will make it again as the taste was incredible - and I am NOT a pie eater.  I had one small piece at 9 pm last night.  There are only 2 pieces left - the hubby has eaten 5 pieces in about 16 hrs. - 2 for breakfast with vanilla ice cream.",

Instead of the tapioca I used a little less than 1/4 cup of corn starch. I also only put about half of the liquid from the fruit and sugar mixture into the pie. I let the pie rest in the oven for one hour after baking as others suggested. I found the 425 degree temp to be much too hot and even though my crust was protected by foil it still got too dark. I will bake at 375 degrees next time and I think that will help. I also used a crumb topping. I brought to Easter dinner and even those who claimed they did not like fruit pie loved it!",
