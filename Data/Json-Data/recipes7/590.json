I think maybe the recipe should say one large avacado/two small because I used one rather small avacado (that's all they had at the store) and the mixture was a little bit soupy and a little on the sweet side so I think if there was more avacado in the mixture it would have been perfect.

You could try just syrup or cocoa and some sweetened condensed milk. Sometimes I like it just with the avocado and other times I stir in the chocolate from the side and bottom of the cup. I thought it was a weird idea but love avocados so had to give it a try. I'm glad I did cause it was yummy and refreshing and not too sweet. And the avocado oil is really good for you. Soemtimes I blend avocado and vanilla icecream (Costco super premium or Haagen-daaz) and refreeze a few minutes if it is a hot day. I leave a few frozen lumps that taste like butter. So good!",
