Oh- and I couldn't find brown sugar so I googled subsitutions and mixed 1 c. white sugar and 3 T molasses in the food processor until mixed. Worked beautifully! They are very crumbly and messy- not the compact car-snack I was hoping for. I may do 3/4 of the crumb mixture on the bottom and then just plop the rest on top so that the jam is more exposed and cooks more it stays very runny.",

Warmed PNB in a glass jar set in boiling water. Having no whisk attachment for stand mixer I used two dinner knives to cut butter into oat mix. Setting bowl aside I worked on the jelly. I was short on Grape jelly so used what I had in the frig: 3/4 cup Grape and 1/8 cup Red Plum jelly plus 1/4 cup of Strawberry preserves a little short on measurement but it worked out okay. Instead of 15 minutes prep time it took me 35 minutes. Cook time of 25-35 minutes turned into 38 minutes. Once pan was removed from oven and mix cooled I covered it with foil and let set overnight. First piece out of pan was semi-firm and too crumbly. Baked another 10 minutes in a 375 degree oven enough to firm it up. Since the bars are much too sweet for me I individually wrapped them held one out for my sweet-toothed sister and froze 24 bars. The oat mix in itself is tasty and could be used to make bars without the jelly. Thanks for the memories of eating PBJ sandwiches in grade school.",
