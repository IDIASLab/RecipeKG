Without this addition it would never have fed 8. I added quite a bit of chipotle powder and smoked paprika to the sauce which took it from bland to phenomenal. I absolutely preferred this to a tomato-based lasagna. Next time I'll add some saut\u00e9ed spinach or chard between the layers.",

I didn t pre-cook the noodles and after broiling slicing and serving realized the noodles were too under-cooked. I added 1/3 cup of water (didn t want it to dry out) resealed and cooked another 15 minutes then another 20 minutes. Scrumptious! I didn t have cilantro; didn t miss it. The spice of the chorizo was just right for our family. We don t do much spice. I might try adding a little spinach next time like another review suggested and I will definitely pre-cook the noodles al dente to speed things up.",
