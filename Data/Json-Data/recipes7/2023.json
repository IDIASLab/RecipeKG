        "description": "An Aeggekage is a traditional Danish oven pancake, usually served as a buffet item or as a dessert for a family holiday meal.  It is a light, cake-like dish that is not too sweet and absolutely delicious with fresh seasonal berries and fresh whipped cream! (Think of it as a sweetened Yorkshire pudding). Just make sure you serve immediately, this pancake does not do well cold nor is it a good leftover.  But chances are you won't have any remaining Aeggekage to worry about!",

Since it was not my own recipe or my own kitchen and we were with new friends I prayed this wouldn't fail. I followed the recipe closely but dared myself to add drops of philly cream cheese. I wanted to insure a success and what better way than dairy and fat? It is awesome and it will impress friends. Try with canned blueberries and extra creamy whipping cream. I confess there was an awkward silence though when it was served. Guests said it looks strange but tastes like heaven.",

This rose slightly but was not substaintial. I cut the amount of butter in half which worked out fine. As the pan had plenty of butter for the batter to swim in. Still even with this correction the cooking time had to be extended a good 5 minutes as the batter was still jiggly after the suggested amount of time. Part of the problem could possibly be the suggested pan or size. Original oven pancakes were made in dutch ovens. Maybe a 9 x 12 pan just wont ever work properly. This recipe also does NOT turn out the correct consistency of Dutch Oven Pancakes. A bit mushy not firm like a quiche but it was cooked throughout. Again I suggest using NO SALT butter if you deem it necessary to use this recipe as the salty taste overwhelmed the dish. I will keep searching for the correct and orignial recipe. This is certainly NOT it.",
