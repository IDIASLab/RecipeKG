Rhubarb cooks/bakes down a lot and I wanted a thicker dessert.  I also used 1 cup of sugar omitting the need for the extra \u00bc cup especially since the topping has another cup of sugar in it.  The bake time and temp is spot on for this recipe.  We enjoyed it warm the first night with vanilla ice cream and room temp the next evening.  It was good both ways, but the topping is definitely better on the first night as it crunchier, which is how my family likes it.  On the second day the topping absorbed the liquid from bottom layer, although still very good, just not as crunchy.  A very good dessert that I will be making again with all the rhubarb I froze this season.  Thanks, Glenn for sharing your recipe.",

For those interested I added a full tsp of cinnamon wherever it called for a 1/2...I love cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and the rest stevia natural sweetener (18 of the little scoops)... I added 1 cup of apples (gala) and 1 1/2 cups strawberries.. the topping I used just a bit less brown sugar and just under 3/4 cup of butter. There is LOTS of topping!! I just finished tasting it and I'm so happy there is a whole pan left to eat!! its amazing. possibly sweeter due to the stevia and strawberries..it doesn't even need ice cream! mmmmm.. thumbs up!",
