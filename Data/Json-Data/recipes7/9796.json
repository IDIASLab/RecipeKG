Add an extra egg 3. Cut the sugar WAY down. I added none at all and while they tasted a little more \"healthy\" they were still sweet. 1/3 cup was a sweet muffin. 4. No need to soak the chia. If you feel you must then you can make the batter as described and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. It will thicken up! I am pregnant and watching my carb intake but I LOVE bread so I have been experimenting. This makes a really healthy muffin! If you choose to use oatmeal oatmeal flour (just grind some up) there are almost 4 grams of protein in each one of these (with the extra egg as well). I liked it!!",

So I highly recommend adding the chia seeds to the orange juice and let it sit for at least 10 minutes or longer. While mixing the wet ingredients I thought there was ALOT of liquid for only one cup of flour. But I went ahead and followed the recipe exactly. Triple checking the ingredients and amounts as I really thought something was missing! It also seemed like way too many blueberries for the amount of batter. The muffins were really really really moist they didn't hold together well and the blueberries are falling out of the bottom because there is no structure to the muffin. Looking back I wish I added more flour used quick oats instead of regular and less blueberries! If they did not have such a wet texture these would be 5 stars they do have a great taste just did not like the texture. I wonder if the submitter of this recipe missed a flour addition? Perhaps there was suppose to be another 1 cup of oat or whole wheat flour? Based on the amount of liquids and sugar there should be at least two cups of flour in this? Perhaps grinding the oats into flour would work.",

I upped the flour to 1 and 1/3 cup (whole wheat of course the batter was too wet. and decrease the sugar to 3/4 a cup looking to lower the sugar content and they are still sweet enough! and I skipped the brown sugar and just sprinkled ground Cinnamon on top!
