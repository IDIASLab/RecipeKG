                "reviewBody": "This is a traditional Red Velvet Cake icing, sometimes called Waldorf-Astoria Frosting. Other versions use butter in place of Crisco, or have slightly more flour. I prefer the butter variety, but this version is stable at room temperature due to the Crisco, and the flavor trade-off is worth it when space in the fridge is at a premium. This was my first time refrigerating the milk/flour mixture and I can honestly say I won't do that again -- getting it that cold makes it hard to beat in without leaving bits behind, so room temperature works best for me. When doubling this recipe, do not double the liquid. I found that 1 1/2-1 3/4 cups milk was sufficient for a doubled recipe, and use whole milk if you can, so the fats bind to the flour rapidly, and you can do less stirring. Not doubling the milk when doubling the recipe is NOT a criticism of the recipe, just a rule of thumb for doubling frosting recipes in general. Thank you Carri G. for sharing your g-grandmother's recipe with us! P.S. Shortening has no flavor, so if yours has a flavor, throw it away and buy a new one, yours is going bad. Off-brands especially do this faster than regular Crisco. If your frosting has a weird TEXTURE that's different -- you needed to beat the sugar longer.",

I ran out of icing sugar and needed a last minute recipe to make some cupcake frosting before running off to a pot-luck.  Looking at this recipe I was skeptical that it would work, but had little other choice.  Even as I was mixing it together, I envisioned a granular crunchy icing.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This was so silky, smooth and delicious!  It's better than my go-to icing recipe even.  I may never buy icing sugar again.  I did make a couple modifications: I used half a cup of butter and half a cup of vegetable shortening, and I didn't have any milk so I used half a cup of whipping cream and half a cup of water.  Sooooo delicious!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is similar to the filling in good old fashioned twinkies and the original filling type for Whoopie Pies(or Gobs) before the invention of Marshmallow Fluff. To tweak this recipe for flavor: add 1 cup of real butter to the existing ingredients the shortening must be the Crisco brand or it really doesn't have quite the same flavor/texture (using butter flavored crisco instead of butter AND Crisco doesn't seem to work). Change the white sugar to powdered sugar and double it to 2 cups it won't be overly sweet. The powdered sugar also has cornstarch in it that will help to thicken the mixture. The flour can be cut back to 2 Tbsp because of the powdered sugar effects. Double the vanilla to 2 tsp use clear vanilla if you would like a really white frosting. A faster way than to \"cook\"(Ermine or boiled milk frosting method): have all ingredients at room temperature. Using a stand mixer (helpful as the mixing process can be long)keep mixing until frosting comes together. (a hand mixer can be used just have to stand there mixing and mixing for quite some time). The mixture starts off as a runny globby mess and the longer it is mixed it magically comes together into a fluffy white frosting. Depending on the size of the cake all of the recipe ingredients could be cut in half. One reviewer made an excellent observation this frosting IS stable at room temperature.",
