I have made this 2x in the past 2 weeks - first time according to recipe (except I cut bake time down to 1 hour) 2nd time I substituted 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil. Second time I made this in the Perfect brownie pan (one that makes the individual brownies as it bakes). I cut the time down to 45 minutes as the metal is touching more sides.

I'll give it another shot and try that next time but if that doesn't wow me I'll be moving on.",
