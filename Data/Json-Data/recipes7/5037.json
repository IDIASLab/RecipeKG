It tastes wonderful and has set up nicely after about 12 hours. Do take the time to read the instructions for cooked jam that come with the powdered pectin. It s important to measure out the sugar ahead of time as it needs to be added all at once. Also if you live above 1 000 feet above sea level you will need to increase the processing time by 5 minutes (I processed mine for 15 minutes because of this). Processing time increases again at 3 000 ft. Check the guidelines to be sure your jars are processed correctly. I couldn t find 12 oz jelly jars so I went with the 8 oz ones. I expected to get 15 jars but only got 12. Still this is a five-star recipe. I can t wait to include this jam in Christmas gift baskets! Thank you for sharing your recipe!",

We don't like anything too sweet so I cut the pineapple amount in half and increased the plums to 14 to make up for it, then cut the sugar to 6 cups. I used the juice of 1 fresh orange, which was just the right amount. I plan to give jars as gifts because I think it's so good. Thanks so much.",

I like cloves & all spice and made this EXACTLY as written. While my 1st batch did not come out as jellied as I thought it might it is absolutely delicious and does indeed have holiday spice undertones. I plan on using this on baked pork loin hams & as a dollop in my baked scones however I've already been using this for wraps. I take smoked turkey swiss cheese (or havarti if I have it) lettuce & use this as the condiment on a wrap. I've also used it on wraps with Black Forest Ham. It turns an ordinary lunch into something heavenly and EVERYONE that has tried it RAVED about how good this is. This is one of the easier jams I've made and truly one of my favorite recipes here at Allrecipes. This one is a keeper & of course you can adjust the spices to your taste. It's beautiful to look at the aroma is magnificent and the taste is sweet spicy and reminiscent of Grandma's kitchen at Christmas. Thank you Rachel for a brilliant contribution.",

I substituted 2 cups crushed w/juice for the fresh pineapple as suggested by another & it worked very well. Definitely will cut the clove next time to maybe 1/4 tsp and add 1/4 tsp cinnamon. As is I will have to use it strictly as a glaze for maybe hams or pork loin or....? I'll try it on a variety of meats & label it as a glaze. For me this yeilded 12 8 oz jars.
