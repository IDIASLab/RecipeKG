Please, if you're going to use frozen strawberries, let them thaw first (or just use fresh strawberries), unless your goal is a vinaigrette smoothie. I went against my better judgement and decided to follow the recipe exactly as written, even though I had fresh strawberries in the refrigerator. Very simple and delicious! I served this as suggested, on a spinach/strawberry/almond/feta salad. So good!!! Thank you Courtney for the great recipe. I'll be making this often!",
