I didn't have red chili peppers at hand, so I used one fresh green chili pepper cut very fine instead. I also used one can (8 oz) of tomato sauce instead of fresh tomatoes. I added the garam masala in with the tomato sauce instead of at the end. My family doesn't like things too spicy, so I left out the ground red pepper. And my pressure cooker operates differently, so I had to adjust the cook time--it took about 10 minutes to reach full pressure, and 20 minutes cooking after that. This sounds like a lot of changes! but really, I had the recipe before me the entire time and just made small changes that I thought would work better for me. The rajma is DELICIOUS, and I can't wait to try out more of Susmita-di's recipes!",

I used all of the ingredients but I had to make a few changes in the preparation method because I don't have a pressure cooker and had only canned kidney beans. At the Step 4 part, I added my rinsed canned beans to the pot and added just enough water to cover the beans (not the full amount listed in the ingredients) and give a bit of sauce. I then brought the curry to a boil and let it simmer for about 10 minutes or so. The whole dish was prepared in about 40 minutes. I served it with jeera rice as suggested. It was really tasty and satisfying and I'll be making it again. I look forward to trying more of the other recipes that you've posted on AR.",
