I also admit I was swayed to try it anyway because of the submitter's identifying himself as \"professional.\" I figured he must know what he's doing! But so do I, and I knew I'd be a tough sell because my favorite banana bread on the planet is one I've made for over 40 years. Well, the verdict is in - I'm sold -  dad_can_cook makes a darn good banana bread! His description is right on. I found it incredibly moist, chock full of banana flavor, light, not nearly as dense as most, and not overly sweet. I had some leftover toasted pecans, so sprinkled some of those over the top rather than the macadamias. Other than that, I followed the recipe as directed and would do so again.  I did find, however, that the baking time was a little off.  I removed mine from the oven at just 58 minutes and wished I would have set it for 55.  Not a dealbreaker though, just watch the baking time carefully. While this won't take the place of my favorite banana bread, it is a great contender. Be sure to have about five, good-sized bananas on hand for this one!",

I followed the directions for the most part except I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 cup chopped walnuts (instead of macadamia) and 1 cup chocolate chips.

It adds a delicious crunch!  *I cooked for a total of 50 minutes = perfect",
