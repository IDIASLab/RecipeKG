It originally was supposed to deep fried in small foil packets, but I found that way too messy. Grilling it is oh so yummy! The longer it marinates, the better it is.

I only used this for the marinade: I used boneless chicken thighs (my husband's favorite cut of the chicken) and marinated them about 10 hours; anything more would have been too much in my opinion. I was afraid they would be too salty (we cook with very little salt) but happily I was wrong. I didn't have enough green onion so used about 1/4 tsp onion powder in the marinade and used the green onion I had as a garnish. I thought about adding a small (1/2 - 1 tsp) of sesame oil but I think it would gave \"muddied\" the flavors. We grilled the thighs whole instead of as kebabs as my experience with kebabs is that it is very difficult to not overcook so that the meat is too dry. Served this with white rice steamed broccoli and an Asian carrot and cucumber slaw (I'll post the recipe) - husband said 10 stars. Thanks for a great recipe! (My husband said I should have boiled the left-over marinade and used it over the rice.)",
