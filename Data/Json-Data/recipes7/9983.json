I frequently pack it in my lunches for work and it keeps for days. I have made adjustments from the first time but this review is for the original recipe. Excellent! a little on the sweet side but I have since reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it is still sweet enough for my sweet tooth. On other occasions I have added craisins and had to substitute green onions for the red since I didn't have any on-hand. The fact that I can make substitutions or add things just speaks to it's versatility. Thank you for this recipe!",
