                "reviewBody": "I did make a few modifications to this recipe. First I only made 1/4 of the recipe (1 block of cream cheese) and I ended up with 6 cheesecakes in a regular size muffin tin. I could also tell that the milk and sour cream amounts were going to leave the batter too watery so I cut the milk back to about 1 Tbls and 1 Tbls of sour cream for my 1/4 batch. I also added a bit of green food coloring to give the cheesecakes a \"minty\" look to them. With that said I have a couple of recommendations. First - you need to add some butter to the cookie crumbs. I did not and the bottoms were just a bunch of crumbs and they didn't hold together so much of the minty bottoms were left in the muffin tin when I removed them. If you add some butter and maybe a bit of sugar to the mixture and press it firmly into the muffin tin I think the crust will hold together better. The flavor was just okay. I wouldn't make these again sorry!",

It was just the right amount of mint for us. We were not fond of the cheesecake portion. The cheesecake was a little spongy and not creamy like most cheesecakes. The filling and crust also made quite a bit more mini cheesecakes than the recipe stated.",
