The amount I used caused a bitter taste that overpowered the eggnog. Since sweet potato and eggnog are two of my favorite foots that was a disappointment. In all fairness it was my fault for making the substitution; so I'm not taking any points away from the recipe. I will try again with fresh orange zest. I just wanted to share my experience so others wouldn't make the same mistake. Happy cooking!",

This is so easy to make and the orange zest gives you a nice pop of freshness really enhancing the flavor of the sweet potatoes. Unfortunately I thought the eggnog flavor was lost. I cut this recipe in half using one can of sweet potatoes and two of us finished it off (and we didn't pig out either). In this house I think the full recipe would serve 6 not 8 so the number of servings might be one thing that you consider. Good weeknight side dish served with a pork roast.
