If that had been in the recipe, it would have saved me a little extra work.  Maybe you all know that already though!  Some other hints, while we're on the topic of meringue, are to use a metal (not plastic) bowl and make sure everything is clean of oils of any kind.  Using an electric mixer really helps as well.  Hope that helps out anyone else who is also rather a novice in the kitchen!",
