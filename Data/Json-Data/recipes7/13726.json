The only time there was some flavor in them was when I bit into a chocolate chip and there wasn't a chocolate chip in every bite. Thank you for the recipe but I will not make these again. 06-06-19 Update: I placed these in the freezer and I tried one today. The flavors actually melded and bloomed. I could taste the peanut butter and they were not bland any longer. I have changed my rating of 3 stars to 4. And yes I would make these again.",
