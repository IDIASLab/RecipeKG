Also I would like to suggest that instead of the plastic wrap thing just lightly grease a nonstick 9 x 9 and dust with the cornstarch and powdered sugar mixture, pour in and then put mixture on the top as well. It saved lots of time and hassel as the first batch stuck horribly to the spots pf wrap that had no spray! Oh then dust a pizza cutter and cut!",
