Since that\u2019s not possible, please note that in my original recipe the rice had too much vinegar, so I now add half the amount of vinegar, sugar, and salt to the sushi rice. Note that Cider vinegar works just fine as a substitute for the rice vinegar in this recipe. Also note that the simmer time on the rice should be reduced to 10 minutes instead 25: any remaining water will be absorbed during the 10 minute hold after that, and the rice will be better (less mushy).",
