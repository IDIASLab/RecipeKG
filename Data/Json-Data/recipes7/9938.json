It is delicious and it still retains that traditional Nanaimo Bar taste. I used almonds in the base layer I also find that goes nicely with the cherry flavor! This is a very sweet dessert the maraschino cherry juice makes it a little sweeter than a traditional Nanaimo bar. So if you are not a big sweet tooth person use just milk or cream in replacement of juice and puree the cherries so you still get a pink filling. This is a very festive and attractive dessert perfect for a Christmas cookie platter!",

Looking past the fact that a true Nanaimo bar is made with custard powder the proportions do not seem correct in the slightest. Here are my gripes: -the base is way too thick and the amount of graham cracker crumbs it calls for is obscene. I added maybe one cup and that was still too much to the point where my base was so crumbly it just didn't even come together properly. -I like many here who have already commented used almonds instead of walnuts. Walnuts would be great in the traditional recipe but if you're already using almond extract in the filling why would you use walnuts in the base? -the cooking time for melting the butter together with the cocoa and sugar is way too much; as is the lack of direction around not adding the egg to the hot butter/cocoa/sugar mix -- you end up with scrambled eggs if you don't temper it. -they're really ought to have been more sugar and more cherry juice added to the middle layer. Also you need at least another teaspoon of almond extract if doing this. -you really need to double if not triple the quantities of chocolate top layer because the amounts called for here or not nearly enough. I am very disappointed with how this recipe turned out and I would not make it again... Serves me right for trying to make a recipe with a twist and not just following the tried-and-true original.",

Why would confectioners sugar and a few cherries be a replacement for a pudding layer? I tried it and just increased the chocolate topping which was simple, but cant imagine what they'll taste like. That's what I get for not wanting to buy pudding powder!!!",
