We live at a high altitude (above 9K) so I only added 1 tsp of baking powder (and made my own since I was out....2 parts cream of tartar + 1 part baking soda). They puffed up nice and the lemon flavor was wonderful! I used one small lemon for juicing and 2 whole lemons for zesting...we also put in the pulp from the lemon we juiced. That made them very lemony and really helped the lemon flavor come out. We topped them with raw honey and butter. We will def. be making these again! Thanks for the great recipe!",
