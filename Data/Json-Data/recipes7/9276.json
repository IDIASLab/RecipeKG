My son thought using a banana pudding mix next time might be a good variation. Presentation of this dish is very impressive. It was a huge hit and he got 100% of extra credit points!

I ended up cutting the flour tortillas into 1/8's instead of quarters - otherwise you end up with something similar to a solid tortilla bowl instead of something closer to a small cup. I heavily coated the tortillas (both sides) with the sugar/cinnamon mixture so they caramelized nicely in the oven. Frankly you could eat them plain at this point without the filling - but make the filling anyway:). I baked them for 11-12 minutes instead of 10 but that's probably my oven. Note that even though it says to \"fold in\" the whipped topping you really have to vigorously stir it in. The pudding/cream cheese/milk mixture is like a pile of (delicious) glue at that point so forget about being able to \"fold\" anything into it. A tablespoon of filling on each tortilla \"cup\" will suffice as these are VERY sweet. As a final touch I finely grated some chocolate (a cold Hershey bar) over each one instead of the maraschino cherry. Make these and you'll be glad you did!",
