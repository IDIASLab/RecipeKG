My mom and I are the only remaining individuals who know how to make this, so I'm posting it hoping to share it with others. It is made the old world way, so it is not quick, but it is delicious and well worth the work and wait.",

Since I am not a lover of Anise flavouring I eliminated the Anise seeds And substituted with a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and a half teaspoon of Anise extract. Also just before baking I gave each loaf an egg wash (I mixed 2 egg yolks with 2 teaspoons of water then brushed each loaf...Makes a great shine). By the way my favourite way to eat this is toasted with a little bit of butter.",
