Frozen ginger is easier to chop or mince. You can also freeze a whole \"hand\" (peeled or not) for grating but the consistency of the grated ginger will be a bit mushy.",

I made it to go with the traditional turkey but also had plenty of leftovers--used some of it on a turkey sandwich (yum) and with a pork roast (yum again). I froze what was left and that left me with some more to enjoy at a later date! I pretty much used the recipe as is with the exception of a bit of lemon zest--the combination of lemon and orange brought out the flavors really well.",
