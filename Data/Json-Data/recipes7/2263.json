No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine and used fresh strawberries. Baking the chips keeps this a little healthier and lower in fat. So for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!",

I thought the cinnamon sugar looked like way to much. I did 1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon and still had some left using half. This recipe and others do not say what type of cooking spray to use. I believe I bought the wrong one. Mine was more like a butter than a spray and my chips were kind of soggy! I think it means a cooking spray like Pam. I do not like kiwi so I left that out but added some chopped strawberries but think the peach idea would have been better. I also added a couple sprinkles of sugar as the chips already have sugar.",
