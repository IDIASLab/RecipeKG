House of Cochrane thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, it\u2019s going into my Favorites folder.****UPDATE 6.6.18:  This is one of my favorite muffin recipes, and I make it often.  Today I had some VERY ripe bananas which needed to be used up, and a few blueberries.  I dusted the blueberries with a little flour and added them to the batter.  Baked up beautifully and made the muffins taste even better.",

I have to say, I do too. They're nice and very flavorful...a great breakfast or snack.  I think I'll be making these instead of my bread going forward. LOVED THEM! :)",

I wish there was a better measurement that simply 3 bananas, because they vary a lot in size, but I had two very ripe ones and some that were not so ripe.  I cut one of the yellow ones into small dice size and folded them in with the  mashed, and it added some extra texture.   I recommend these to anyone who is starting out learning to bake.  \n\nSecond take, my husband said they were a little too sweet.  I cut back the  white sugar and used a little more than 1/2 c brown sugar.  I also added about a quarter cup of oatmeal, and they were perfect.  These will go into the muffin rotation without a doubt.  Thank you.",
