This was an experiment for me as I made a few adjustments to accommodate my egg allergy and to also make it a little lower in calories (used egg substitute light egg nog and only 1/4 sugar and the rest Splenda)so I did not expect it to turn out. I baked it for only 60 minutes and the result was a moist delicious bread that everyone loves. Great recipe!",

I used 3 cups of add-ins (mixture of green/red candied cherries raisins and other candied fruit though I omitted the nuts) that I soaked for a day in the remnants of a bottle of Tia Maria (that which I later poured over the cakes after pricking them a little). I do think this it could use another cup of add-ins but that's personal preference as the fruit cake my mother used to make was literally jam-packed with add-ins. I also added 2 tsps. of homemade pumpkin/apple pie spice. The eggnog flavour was barely detectable (maybe because of the addition of alcohol) so the next go around I'll try making it with milk to make it more cost effective.",
