Added a few more fresh veggies - radishes, zucchini, cauliflower & sliced black olives.  As far as the dressing goes, I used clamato juice and substituted bottled hot sauce and worchestershire sauce for the salsa.  I mixed the cabbage and everything else together but the dressing as I didn't want it to get too soggy as I knew there would be leftovers as I made the whole recipe for just me.  It is a keeper!!!  I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks!!  Great for a picnic as there is no mayo or anything that can spoil in the sun/heat!!",
