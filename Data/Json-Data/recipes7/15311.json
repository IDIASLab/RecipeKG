I made half the recipe as it's just the two of us and we were leaving on vacation so I didn't want it to go to waste. The little that was left I smeared on a Sandwich Thin for lunch the next day. Delicious. I also served with toasted rye points. Maybe next time I'll add a few shakes of hot sauce for extra flavor and a little punch.",
