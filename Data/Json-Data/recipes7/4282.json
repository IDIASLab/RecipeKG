This is good with the French Vanilla Cool Whip if you can find it.",

We ate up the leftover salad today; still good, but is best on the day it is made.  You can mix up the cranberries and sugar and refrigerate overnight, if desired, then add remaining ingredients just before serving.  This one's a keeper!",

But I found when just having all the ingredients mixed together it was truly wonderful when added to the Thanksgiving dinner menu. I did omit the pecans because of a nut allergy at our table but I'm sure they would have added a lovely crunch to the salad. I also used Braeburn apples and vanilla Greek yogurt as those items were ones I had on hand and the recipe did not state type. Also increased the marshmallows by a 1/2 cup. Thank you Doris for posting this recipe; it went over extremely well for a non-cranberry sauce eating crowd!",

Family loved it I only had granny smiths on hand and was worried about how tart this maybe so I did add 1 tablespoon of honey before adding the yogurt&whipped cream mixture. Kids ate it up and asked for seconds. Very delicious and healthy dessert quite refreshing change. Am thinking I it's red color would make this very suitable with a Valentines Day dinner as well.",
