I used only a small amount of butter and a bit of olive oil to saute the garlic and added some scallions. I also used both both scallops and large uncooked shrimp cooked with a bit of white wine and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Instead of cream I added a wedge of laughing cow lite cheese to thicken the sauce along with the freshly grated parmesean cheese. In a separate pan I cooked asparagus and a small amount of angel hair pasta cooked together with more basil and parsley and lemon juice. Once that was cooked I cut up the asparagus and added that along with the pasta to the scallops and shrimp. The second time I made this I used risotto and added the asparagus to the risotto. Both were delicious. I will definitley be making this often. Thank you Jim!",
