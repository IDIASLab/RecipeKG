I make the batter, my husband does the cooking, and the kids help us make them disappear! We like to dip our aebleskivers in raspberry jam, maple syrup, and powdered sugar. The cardamom gives them that something extra. No wonder this recipe is a family favorite! Danish cooks use a long knitting needle to turn the doughnuts, but you can use a fork, too.",

I used a thin layer of peanut oil instead of shortening. The batter was thick enough that it made little pancake shapes but thicker. I fried 4 spoonfuls at a time and flipped them after a few minutes. They turned out tasty. They have a nice crunchy layer on the outside and a soft breadlike middle. Because I like a sweeter \"pastry\" I added a bit more sugar and I also added cinnamon. The cinnamon and cardamom play well together. My son liked them plain. My daughter liked them with the cinnamon/powdered dusting sugar. I liked them with my organic raspberry pomegranate jelly. My husband thought they would taste better in Denmark but he still enjoyed them. ha ha Overall these were pretty good and they worked just fine without the special pan. They would probably be better with the special pan since it would crisp all edges as well but it was manageable and tasty anyway.",

He told us about eating them when the Skandinavian women would gahter to quilt. He made sure to show up at the house where they were quilting so he could get some. These women were from pioneering times in my valley. So began my search. I had a great recipe but lost it so I searched here and found this recipe. I didn't have the cardoman so skipped it. They turned out great. We have 7 kids. I could not keep up once I started serving. The only problem is a I need a second pan. Thanks for sharing.",

They were a special meal (usually breakfast) that we had for special occasions holidays & potlucks and Danish holidays/celebrations. We would eat them warm straight straight out of the pan as my mother made them. I am giving this recipe 5 stars; however I did make a couple modifications to it that I feel are important for this to be more authentic and taste better; and I also feel that there are some tips and things that need to be said. Especially if you have never made these before. So here goes! First off this is a wonderful authentic recipe but with minor changes as stated below. (1) use only 3/4 of a tbsp of cardamon if you have fresh cardamon. If it is older cardamon use 1 tbsp. If you use the 1 1/2 tbsp of cardamon it has a very very strong cardamon taste. (2) once the batter is made add diced apples to it. I core and chop up 1 whole granny smith apple and throw it in there. (I don't peel mine) Any sweet tasting apple will work. I am Danish and we grew up making these in our home. I use CAST IRON aebelskiver pan which you can get from any of the scandinavian store",
