I do think you could simplify it by letting your broccoli boil for a minute and then add the carrots for that last minute. That way you could just dump it all out in a colander  and get the cold water running over it. I made as written but spooning all of the broccoli out took quite a bit of time that I don't feel is needed. This is a great recipe and would pair nicely with all kinds of main dishes.
