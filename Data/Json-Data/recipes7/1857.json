I also added about 3T of Southern Comfort to the recipe as my family loves Eggnog and SoCo. I baked it at 275 for 2:45 and cooled it in the oven for about 2:30 and then stuck it in the fridge.

I whipped whipping cream with a whisk by hand (yes it takes longer but it doesn't break down and turn back into watery weird stuff and lasts for days) and used a piping bag to decorate the top and then grated a wee bit of fresh nutmeg on top of the whipped cream. To die for! Thanks for the recipe!",

The texture was amazing the balance of flavours was great. The flavour of the eggnog was subtle enough that even people not crazy about it would still love the cake. The only adjustments I made was that I did not do a water bath I put a pan of water underneath. I also increased the temperature of the oven to 300 in the last hour because I needed it to cook faster. I think at 200 it would have taken at least 4.5 hours to cook. I turned the oven off when the middle was still very wobbly but left the oven closed for 2 hours. It cooked right through and wasn't overcooked. FANTASTIC!!
