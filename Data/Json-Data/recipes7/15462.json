I seared the floured chicken on both sides rather than cooking a full 5 minutes per side. Instead of making the sauce in a sauce pan I threw the next 3 ingredients in the pan with the seared chicken cooked for 5 minutes then added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for another 20 minutes. Subs: I used 1 tsp ground ginger instead of fresh in the pan a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and omitted pine nuts. This was good but not fabulous. And I think it made plenty of sauce so maybe not reducing the sauce as much was a good thing?",
