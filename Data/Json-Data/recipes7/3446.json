I totally forgot to add the chicken bouillon.  I brought it to a boil then reduced it to a simmer and cooked for about 8 - 10 minutes until the orzo was done.  This way, all the liquid was absorbed and I didn't need to drain it.  I was hoping to get more of the wine flavor this way.  Then I stirred in more like 1/2 cup of parmesan and then added the roasted veggies.  ",

What I like most about it is that it is extremely versatile...use whatever vegetables you like or what's in season, and pick your pasta and protein. I've made it vegetarian, with chicken and with shrimp. When I cook the pasta I either use a couple of bouillon cubes or stock (whatever I have on hand). And I agree that one package of orzo is WAY too much...you should use more like 1/2 a package for 4 servings. When roasting the vegetables I've started subbing the sugar for a T of balsamic vinegar. And last but not least...MORE CHEESE!",
