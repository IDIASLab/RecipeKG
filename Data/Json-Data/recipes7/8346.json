If you have a kitchen Aid stand mixer: this was my method- whipped 1C butter flav. crisco + 1/2 C. real butter & 3C sugar for 8 minutes at highest speed, occasionally scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.  Then added one egg and whipped one more minute, added another egg and whipped one more minute, scraped the sides of the bowl, and repeated the process  until all 6 eggs were whipped in, which added 6 more minutes to whipping time.  Turned mixer to lowest speed, then added 1 cup of sour cream (was short on sour cream so used half and half to fill up the rest of the measurement), 2 teaspoons of coconut extract and 1 teaspoon of almond extract [cuz one reviewer said smelled like sun tan lotion while baking] and kept the mixer running while I sifted the flour and baking soda into a separate bowl. added a tiny pinch of salt. Then slowly poured in the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl at lowest speed still & as soon as it was all in and wet, turned mixer off & gentle stir with spatula then poured it into greased/floured bundt pan.Crucial: bake at 325* for 70 minutes! cool on wire rack 10 minutes b4 inverting from pan. glaze crown  w/ thick mixture of half&half,powdered sugar, & 1 tsp  coconut extract.  sprinkled 1 C. coconut on top of glaze, & 1/2 C. choc chps on top of that. Thnx Paula 4 best cake I ever made!Excellent! Beautiful!",

I loved that this used crisco and I didn't have to remember to bring butter to room temp., lol, but believe it or not, this still had a nice, buttery taste to it. The smell of this baking is intoxicating! Oh, and the baking time was spot on in my new oven. :) Loved the slightly crunchy top and the moist beautiful texture if the inside. This is a keeper, for sure~YUM! Paula, Thank You and your MIL for sharing such a delicious recipe! :)",

Not kidding at all....40 min. It smelled like suntan oil in my kitchen while baking & I couldn't get past that sentiment while eating it. I would've preferred to get the coconut flavor from shredded coconut itself. That being said I took it to a family get-together & got positive comments on it. This was a really hard one for me to rate. I'd give it 10 stars for appearance & texture.",

I used 1 cup of vanilla Greek yogurt and 3 Tbsp. of cream cheese (for the sour cream). I used Truvia sugar instead of cane sugar too. (Worked great)\nI pour the batter into for parchment lined mini loaf pans, &  baked at 300\u00b0 for  an hour. \n(Checked w/toothpick) \nI Plan on giving these out, along with Christmas cookie tins, for the Christmas holiday. \nStay safe everyone \nMerry Christmas!",
