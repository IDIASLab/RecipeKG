The receipe makes about 5 dozen and we usually have them gone in a week, lol. They definitely boost my milk supply. I haven't had them for a week and a half and my supply has gone down, so I currently have more in the oven now! Would be a fun recipe to throw in different things, dried fruit and nuts and such.",
