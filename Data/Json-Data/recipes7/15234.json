I added a little more water, and it did come together eventually--though it was difficult to work with, and still kind of crumbly even with extra water. I thought that as it would bake, it would come together a little more, but it really didn't. It's still super crumbly and makes eating these pretty messy. The overall flavor is good, just too crumbly. If I made these again, I would probably use Chef John's pie crust recipe instead, and then make the pop tarts from there. I also filled mine with blueberry jam, and they tasted great.",
