The crust is easy and flakey the filling not sweet but light and would go perfect with a dessert wine or cup of coffee or tea. Having the leftover pie with my morning coffee. Yum! Doesn't take 4 hours! It takes the same amount of time that it takes to make any pie.",

Also I noticed a few other recipes called to drain the ricotta for a while before using. I did this and came away with about a cup of water. The only thing I would do differently is to add some Amaretto for a different twist. I did not precook the crust just chilled it after rolling it and poking. It was fine just took quite a bit longer to bake. The 160 internal temp was the perfect time to take out the pie. Thanks for another hit Chef John!",

I purchased a pre-made pie crust from Sprouts Market so I reduced the recipe to make 6 servings of the ricotta filling. Instead of water I squeezed in juice from the the orange I zested. I did not use lemon (I didn't want the sourness). I did add mini chips and sunk them as chef j suggested. I used 2 tablespoons of sugar. I topped the pie with sliced almonds--tasted and looked great! They toasted while on the pie in the oven. The next time I do this I will not pre-bake my crust. The crust will be store bought; I'm not motivated to make my own pie crust.",
