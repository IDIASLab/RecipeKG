Surprisingly, it is not overly sweet (I was slightly concerned about that with 2 cups of sugar), the orange zest lends a nice flavor. The only thing that I did differently was to add a butter/flour/brown sugar topping that was left over from another recipe! The family loved it & I will definitely be making this bread again. I'll probably experiment with different dried fruit and a different topping! May even juice the orange used for zest, poke holes in the bread once it's baked and cooled and poor the juiced orange over it! It seems pretty versatile and I was very surprised that there weren't more reviews! This would be a great choice around the holidays also!",
