My wife is a pie baker supreme, but has been very busy with her business lately, and thus, if I want dessert, I have to do it. No, I'm not complaining. I love to cook, but would never do a pie, since that was her kingdom. Her being so busy, gave me an opportunity to make a pie and not hurt her feelings. This was my first venture into the world of pie making, and it was highly successful. She loved it!!! Thanks Chef John. This filling is fantastic. Attention all you DIVAS out there. Make this as is. Don't send a review in saying you used whole wheat flour to make it more healthy or used less sugar because it seem like too much from your vast experience. As Nilke says, \"Just do it\".",

Came out beautifully and every bit was scarfed down. It made 8 generous pieces. I refrigerated the 8th piece for the next day (it was even better). \n\nI used a 9.5 scalloped glass pie pan but followed the recipe exactly. What I really liked about it is that it wasn't loaded with cinnamon.  Over use of cinnamon makes everything taste the same-like cinnamon! I used 8 medium sized & very juicy peaches but it did not turn watery or ruin the crust.. \n\nIt was my first lattice work pie.  I made my crust with the old standard Crisco recipe but I made 1 1/4 recipe because my pan was a tiny bit bigger and to allow for lattice boo boos. It was actually very easy to do thanks to the video.\n\nHave one negative remark. The recipe said 30 minutes prep time.  It took me an hour+.  Baked to a perfect golden brown in 1 hours & 25 minutes.  I was surprised it didn't overbrown with the cream & sugar on it, but I watched it closely.\n\nI started early to have plenty of cooling time so I was ok.  It was well worth the time and effort an I will definitely make it again.  \n\nThanks again Chef John for another winner!",
