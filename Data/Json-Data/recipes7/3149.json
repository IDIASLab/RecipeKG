I cooled the \"tea\" in an ice bath for about 15 minutes until it was room temp. Otherwise I did everything as the recipe dictated. I tried using a little less syrup as another user suggested but I ended up needing the full amount to cut the tartness of the lemon. I also used raw sugar instead of white sugar because I think it looks better! I gave it 4 stars because there is no way this makes 2 servings. This barely filled a martini glass and only has 3 ounces of alcohol (the equivalent of 1 regular martini).",
