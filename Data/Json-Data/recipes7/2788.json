Traditionalists should be aware that it is not your standard \"southern\" cornbread...it is rich and a little sweet and almost cakelike rather than crumbly. I am sure I will make it again, it was such a hit, it is very moist and a 9X13 pan is a lot of cornbread so it would be great for a crowd.  Like another reviewer, I had to bake it another 15-20 minutes longer than called for.  30 minutes does not seem to be long enough for such a big pan and it was wet in the middle at 30 minutes.  It was perfect at 50 minutes but I would start watching it at 40 to be on the safe side.  I did not have any frozen corn but I had a can of creamed corn and I put that in, it worked great and gave some extra texture without having big kernals of corn.  I kept the rest of the recipe exactly as written. A winner.",

It IS the meal! This cornbread is better than some wedding cakes! Ps.....For the reviewer who said it came out dry and crumbly...you did something wrong. I've made it twice. Easy recipe and perfect texture. I mixed with a handheld electric mixer (no idea if it matters) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",

Pour into a 9 x 13 baking pan sprayed with cooking spray and bake in 350* preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.  Very close to Marie Callendar's. Enjoy!!!!!  NOTE: Use a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk then enough regular milk to equal the 2 cups.  No need to open another can.  Also, I have never used corn kernels but I don't see why not.  Just make sure it is drained well as to not add additional moisture.",
