                "reviewBody": "Heather Snell thank you for posting this recipe. This recipe was awesome! I did not change anything. I was unsure of finding the seltzer water. I've never looked for it. I bought the S.Pellegrino sparkling water because that is considered seltzer water. I very much appreciated the detailed instructions about folding turning and flattening. Months ago I had watched something similar done on The Great British Baking Master Class episode. I tried to find a YouTube video on that step but the biscuit videos I watched did not mention or show that step. I've never made homemade biscuits before and was thrilled with the results. Tonight I ate a half biscuit plain. (I would have eaten the other half but I also made Dark Chocolate Marbled Banana Bread with Greek Yogurt. ) The biscuit was good tasting and was not greasy. Tomorrow I will put strawberries on a biscuit. I do not think the recipe needs more or less sugar. Biscuits may be my next potluck item. They do not need to be refrigerated. I could also take butter and jam. How easy is that?",

I made this one so I could use up a good amt of Greek yogurt I had left over and I hate to waste good food. It worked out great. I even followed the fold and turn method described here for kneading I think it made it very flaky and had many layers. I cut them out at about 3/4\" thick not 1/2\" thick to be sure they'd rise high. I made some that night to eat and the others I froze. A few nights later I baked them from frozen adding extra baking time. They were just as delish. Good for make ahead meals. I will cut back a bit on the sugar next time. If you want to make these for dessert as a strawberry shortcake add more sugar. But bc it's savory I thought a bit less sugar was better for my taste. All in all a great flaky biscuit.",
