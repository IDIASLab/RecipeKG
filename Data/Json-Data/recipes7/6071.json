I will admit tho that I didn't want to make a full 9-in. cheesecake to I taylored this down to fit a 9-in. Keebler graham crust. To do this I used 2 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese softened 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 tst vanilla 2 eggs 1/3 cup lime juice and 1 tsp lime zest. I baked at 350 for about 50 minutes or until center was almost set.

I also put on a simple whipped cream topping (1 cup heavy whipping cream 4 tbsp sugar. Whip in a stand mixer 3-5 minutes until it forms soft peaks). Anyway will definitely make this again!",

With those challenges and changes it still yields a flavor that cannot be missed or hated. Keeping this one around. Thank you so much for a fun idea!!",

This cheesecake is so delicious and refreshing - even friends who worry over my use of hot and spicy dishes - were in awe of this one! Yes it's tart! I have dozens of recipes for sweet cheesecakes but this is just wonderful for a summer dessert. A couple of times I have added a sour cream topping which smooths out the tartness a little but this was more to cover a cracked top. I've made it with up to 3 jalapenos and it's still not very spicy just a lovely aftertaste of a little heat. I also tried a ginger snap crust which very much compliments the other flavors. It freezes very well too!",
