I made it without raisins cut the baking time down to 45 minutes and covered it with a towel for a bit after taking it out of the oven. I does have a consistency similar to cornbread but the flavor of soda bread. I had to make my own self-rising flour by adding a little salt and baking powder. Thanks so much for this recipe! Will definitely be making this again!",
