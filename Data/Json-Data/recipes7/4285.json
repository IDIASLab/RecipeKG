This lower sugar bread was moist easy and delicious. We could actually TASTE the pumpkin over the spice which was a nice change. Next time I'm using whole wheat flour and some wheat germ as well as cutting back to 1/3 c oil and 1/3 c applesauce. Will definitely make this again!",

To plump the oats, I let them sit in a half cup of applesauce, quarter cup oil & the pumpkin for a while.  I subbed splenda for the white sugar. It is a heavy bread - heavier than most.  No \"wows,\" but pretty good.  Next day review:  13 year old boy likes it.  Surprise.  The spices deepened overnight.  Not strong still, but more evident.  I'll have to play with this one to get it lighter - as in less dense.  A couple more days later, the spices intensified so much no one liked it.  We threw it away.  Definately wouldn't freeze this one.  Eat within a few days.",
