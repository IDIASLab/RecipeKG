I used splenda(they have both white and brown follow directions each one is different) to replace both sugars and didn't find it was too sweet like the other review. I didn't mess with the flour since it was such a small amount. One recommendation I have is to flatten after you scoop you dough. mine didn't flatten out like most cookies do. Once I did that with my second pan they turned out great.",
