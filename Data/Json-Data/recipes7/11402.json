I should mention that I did not use the prunes, as I had exactly 1 cup of chopped dates left in a bag and about 6 whole dates, that I just chopped up and subbed for the prunes. My teenage daughter arrived from school and asked \"what's in this bread? Are those chocolate chips?\" ... (Me) \"No, those are dates\" . . . (Her) \"why do you always put weird stuff in there, you know I don't like that stuff?\" . . . (she takes a piece anyway). Five minutes later she takes another piece . . . (Me) \"I thought you didn't like that weird stuff in there?\" . . . (Her) \"I don't!\" (takes another piece). Enough said, it's delicious whether she will admit it or not.",

It makes the perfect breakfast bread or perhaps it's dessert at breakfast when we spread whipped cream cheese on top of our slices after toasting them to carmelize all the sugary fruits. Recipe is great. Only thing I modify is I don't soak & throw away raisins but use dried cranberries and just pour water with baking soda over all the dried fruit I combine in my initial big bowl (cranberries, dried figs, dates). I tend to make 2-3 at a time & give as gifts, while we keep one to plow into. It keeps well over days & days wrapped in press n' seal.",
