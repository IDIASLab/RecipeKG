What is VERY handy is to up the recipe servings to 30 for my bread machine & at the end of the dough setting I make 5 dough balls: One for the family for the night for pizza, then I make 4 balls of dough and cover them tightly with saran wrap and place in freezer. Then on a night when we need a quick meal we pull out a ball of frozen dough and let though like 5-10 minutes and start rolling it out for a pizza(we like the thin crust lower carbs).  It tastes fresh to us even from the freezer and the dough is actually easier to work with.  I also have made calzones with success.  I would try this pizza dough recipe for sure and bookmark too  :)",

I put some garlic powder on the crust right after the oil, and all my kids actually ate their crust! ;) I have a pizza stone, but just used a round pizza pan, and the crust was soft, and the bottom was just the right amount of crisp. Not burnt, not crunchy, kinda chewy with a bit of crisp at the very bottom. Delicious!!!",

Then I pulled it out and topped it and threw it back in for about 8 minutes. I baked at 425. I also put some garlic powder on the olive oil before I pre baked. This came out amazing. We live in Chicago so we know pizza and we loved this. Oh and I also used 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 cup of bread flour- I did prick the crust but it still bubbled a bit. \nThanks so much for this recipe- cheaper and healthier than the pizza joint.",

Dough tastes better anyway when it has a day or 2 in the fridge.  I cranked up the heat in my oven to 550 with a pizza stone in there and let it preheat for 30 minutes.  I put the rolled out dough on a rimless baking sheet dusted with cornmeal, put toppings on the raw dough, and slid off the baking sheet directly onto the pizza stone and cooked for 7 minutes.  Cracker crust, the best I've ever made, and it was so EASY and DELICIOUS.",
