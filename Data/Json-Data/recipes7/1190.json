There were 5 of us \"fighting\" over the last two. Some tips she gave were: to make sure you find a nice moist brand of dates that are not stringy; to use semi-fatty regular cut or thick cut bacon that won't crisp too quick but will add lots of liquid/fat to soften up the dates a bit; and to find a chorizo that isn't to hard (if you can only find a harder chorizo you should pan fry the chunks a bit in olive oil to soften them up but be careful not to overcook and make it tougher!)",
