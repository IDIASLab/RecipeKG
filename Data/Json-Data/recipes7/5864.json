Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until the flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to three days. Roll one ball out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate and chill for at least 20 minutes before baking. Roll out top crust and set aside.\n"

Thank you KateC for the recipe.",

I think the combination of peanut butter and chili sounds appealing and smells good but neither of us really liked it. The peanut butter makes a hard crust on the bottom of the chili. I might have liked it more if I had mixed the peanut butter into the chili. Positives: The chili sets up nicely and does make it easy to remove the pie slices. It makes for good leftovers.",

You don't have to use my recipe but I do recommend a butter vs Cisco crust. I also exclusively use creamy peanut butter. The texture is great when it's all gooey and melts right into your mouth. In my experience crunchy doesn't work well as it tends to burn and take on an odd texture. I hope all who make it enjoy!",
