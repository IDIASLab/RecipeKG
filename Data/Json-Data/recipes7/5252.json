The difference between this apple crisp and others I have eaten is the slight change in the topping. It is not really crispy except for the \"old fashioned oats\" I used. And the topping tastes like an oatmeal cookie but has the consistency of \"apple butter \" but it is really sweet! The marshmallows dissolved while cooking but I am guessing were added for extra sweetness? I thought it was a little sweet which could definitely be cut back. But texture aside I did like that the topping tasted slightly like a baked oatmeal cookie which was a little different.",

Next time I'll make one just for me! I made this very close to the original recipe except in half. And I used 5 smallish Fuji apples instead of 4 large Granny Smiths since that's what I had on hand. The proportion was perfect! So good but it is very sweet. If you pair it with anything make sure it's not sweet - probably not something you want to add ice cream to. It would go wonderfully with a cappuccino!",
