This actually measured up pretty well. If you you don t put ice in your glass the frozen grapes certainly would help chill the sangria a little (but go ahead & add ice). Today I used what I had on hand (chardonnay) but next time I think I ll try pino gris brandy instead of the rum and add the cinnamon stick. Thanks themistycat (my second cat was named Misty) for a nice refresher on a blistering hot Florida day. I ve always enjoyed white sangria more than the traditional red and your recipe is a good one!",

This year I made the Sangria Sangria Recipe and this recipe. This one was a huge hit! The ladies told me to bring this from now on and forget the Red. I followed the recipe as written with one modification. Since I was going to be out of town for a week prior to the party I knew I'd be strapped for time so before I left on vacation I made batches of the Sangria... mixing the wine rum sugar and orange juice and I froze it in freezer bags. The day of the party I prepared the fruit and bagged it. Then at the party I put the frozen sangria mix added the soda and the fruit. A gallon freezer bag holds a double recipe. The extra is in the freezer for entertaining this summer.",
