I got some really great local fresh grown strawberries blue berries and I also used some fresh raspberries at a local farmers stand along one of our back roads in Lancaster PA. I liked that this was a completely made from scratch recipe instead of using boxed sugar cookies. My only change was that I used 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of cup shortening and cup butter. It turned out perfect and it looks so impressive but was really quite easy!",
