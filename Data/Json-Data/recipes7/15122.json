I like being able to melt the butter first, as I keep mine in the freezer and HATE to have to wait for it to come to room temperature.  But this worked really well.  Yummy cookie bars just the way the recipe is written.   ******UPDATE****** The second batch I changed up a little bit.  Instead of vanilla -- I'm out!!--- I used some orange oil for flavor, and tossed in a handful of coconut flakes.  I also used a mixture of white and dark chocolate chips, and made a recipe and a half.  I really prefer this way.  The orange oil enriches the recipe, and I was able to cut back a bit on the sugar by using white chips.",
