No one had seen a green bean casserole topped with mashed potatoes before but my whole family thought it was a nice touch. The only thing I added to the recipe was just a little bit of garlic powder in the soup (added in with the pepper) and a little bit more just mixed into the potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the instant potatoes. Also the potatoes soaked up a bit of the soup in the casserole which added to their flavor. I was skeptical about making a green bean casserole for Christmas but I'm glad I chose this one. It was a hit! Overall I give this recipe 4 stars for being quick easy and tasty but it could have used maybe a few more seasonings just to make the flavors pop a bit more. I think the garlic was a nice addition.",

I cooked up some homemade mashed potatoes and chopped my green beans first. I steamed my green beans and I definitely cooked more than the recipe called for so I grabbed a 2 qt baking dish. I combined the soup a bit more milk than what's asked added some extra garlic powder mixed in some shredded cheese and some pre-cooked chopped onion (fried in butter- 1 small white onion). I used French's Ranch fried onions but only mixed in about a 1/4 cup. Mixed everything up poured in dish and followed the rest of the recipe as suggested (but I also topped with some cheddar cheese). It was great!",
