My tried and true cupcake recipe had previously been a variation of the Magnolia vanilla cupcake recipe, but since my boyfriend's daughter is now a vegan, I needed to find something to bake for her birthday.  All I can say is WOW!  The texture was great, moist, dense enough (but not too dense), with a faint coconut aroma (due to the coconut oil).  My boyfriend actually said these were the best cupcakes I'd ever made and has now been officially converted to a cupcake lover.  I served these with a confectioner's sugar \"quick frosting\": a 1 lb. box of confectioner's sugar, 1/4 c. orange juice (or an orange reduction using vegan butter & agave syrup for a little more flavor), about a 1/2 tbsp. of orange zest, and 1 tsp of bourbon vanilla.   I've already made this recipe twice (in two weeks) and will continue to use it, even for my non-vegan friends and family.  ",

See bakingribbons.blogspot.com for complete instructions. Update 12-05-09 made again today Instead of sugar I used 1/2 cup granulated splenda 1/4 cup Agave syrup and reduced the Rice milk to 1 1/4 cups. Also subsituted whole wheat pastry flour for 1 cup of the flour. Sprinkled sliced almonds on top. Baked 13 min and they were done. Finished with a mix of cinnamon and splenda sprinkled on top right out of the oven. Diabetics can eat this. READ ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR CHANGES: I just made these they are delish!!! As the recipe and reviewers say easy to modify to your tastes. I made 12 cupcakes and put the rest of the batter in an 8x8 pan for a little cake. YUMMY! I used Rice milk instead of almond milk canola oil instead of coconut oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice instead of vinegar 3/4 teaspoon almond extract instead of vanilla and I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon. They are wonderful!!!",

We use jam for frosting, as powdered sugar also contains cornstarch, and my youngest son is allergic to citrus.  But, we will make these frequently!",

If you don't do this, there is NO WAY your coconut oil will do anything other than revert back to it's hardened state, and you'll have massive clumps of coconut oil in your batter that cannot be broken up by any means, which will do nothing other than utterly ruin the batter, and leave you absolutely infuriated.  Details like this NEED to be in the recipe since not everyone likes to consider the physics of a 4 1/2 star recipe that should be fine as is.  In hindsight, this error should not have happened since I know that coconut oil will solidify at 76 degrees, but when I'm making a recipe, I simply expect the recipe to be accurate, and since the recipe list did not call for WARM milk, it was not.",
