I made a few tweaks, based on my love of spices and full-bodied flavor:\n-I doubled the basics \u2014whole onion, whole cabbage, 4 Tbs butter, 2 c water, 2 Tsp Kosher salt\n-I pumped up the vinegar bc I love it so much (and it is so good for you): 3 Tbs apple cider vinegar + 2 Tbs strawberry balsamic \n-Used 3 Tbs vs 2 (when doubling) of whit sugar, which turned out to be a great ratio with the sweeter vinegars\n-After melting the butter, I put in the following spices: ground black pepper, celery seed, turmeric, smoked paprika and a bay leaf. Stir and let the spices bloom in the hot butter to create an excellent flavor base\n-I saut\u00e9ed the (red) onion for a good 10 minutes prior to adding the cabbage\n-Took time to soften down the veg mixture before adding the water, vinegar, sugar and salt\n\nWith the extra vinegar, it turned out almost like a rich soup/borscht, and was absolutely delicious and so healthful eaten right from a bowl. Great suggestion to pair with rye bread. I will play with this by adding sliced tart apples, raisins, and using red cabbage. Cheers!",
