But we loved it and couldn't stop eating!  I used Fuji apples I took off my tree last Fall, chopped and frozen in my freezer.  Because they are really sweet I only put in half the sugar and I let them cook until they caramelized.  It was perfect--we didn't even use any syrup and you know how kids love syrup!  I didn't add any bourbon.  I didn't have oat flour so I used half quick oats and half old fashioned (since I was running out of quick oats.)  I didn't process them or sift anything, which just goes to show how forgiving this recipe is.  I put in exactly the listed amount of bacon but only because that's all I had--I think you can always add more bacon!\n\nA great recipe.  Now I have to whip up another batch for my husband.  Too bad his won't have bacon!",
