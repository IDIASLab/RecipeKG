Calling the dough sticky is the understatement of the century, there was no way I could roll it out and make shapes (perhaps because I used buttermilk?) SO, I came up with a great idea to put it in a ziplock bag, cut the end and pipe the shapes onto the cookie sheets.  They came out FABULOUS!  And taste just like I remember from when I was a kid.

Soft Kringla are amazing! I do mine in all sorts of shapes but be careful to keep the same shape on each cookie sheet for even cooking. I do hoops figure 8's twists 'S' shapes and spirals (think snail shell). I've experimented with coating these in chocolate --- amazing! You can dip half a cookie or use a thin-tip pastry bag and swirl on (think of following the spiral indent) or stripe on. Gotta use good quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate though. Great recipe! Glad to see another soft-Norwegian Kringla recipe on the web.",
