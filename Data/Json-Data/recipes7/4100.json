Also you may need to use less milk (Use between 1/4-1/2 cup). Also for the topping add the sugar after you mash the blueberries (You don't need to mash all the blueberries--You can leave some whole). Finally parchment paper is not necessary nor is greasing the pan. It will stick a little but comes out nicely from my glass cake pans.",

The pie was so soggy in the middle that upon cutting it all the filling (mixed with dough) freely flowed out. I had already increased baking time by 15 minutes but that obviously didn't help either. Also the crust was more like angel food than cookie dough. I wonder if allrecipe's metric/US converter was a bit off. I converted the recipe back into the metric system (I grew up in Europe and operate on metric measures)and the measures were odd considering that it was supposed to be a 'metric' recipe originally. I might give this another try but so far I am quite disappointed with the results.",
