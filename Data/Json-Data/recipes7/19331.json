The cakes baked up very nicely, and I am usually an erratic baker at this altitude. (I am at 7,500 feet in Los Alamos, NM.) I will make a couple of changes when I make it again. I will do a combination of fine and coarser shredded carrots (and maybe add a little more), and would definitely add more raisins, maybe even double them. My family had absolutely no complaints as it was, but like to improve it if I can. The cakes needed to cool completely before removing from the pans, and even then they needed a little \"convincing.\" I definitely recommend!",
