I think the previous reviewer may have over cooked the corn syrup creating the \"Cement\". Since I didn't have enough corn syrup I created the syrup component by mixing what white corn syrup with some dark corn syrup some molasses and a bit of maple syrup and it still came out delicious. My next attempt I will make \"home made\" crust the store brand is a little too thin for my liking. Thanks for sharing this simple yummy recipe.",
