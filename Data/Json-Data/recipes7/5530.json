Mine turned out too browned and crispy on top which wasn't what I was going for. I wonder if it's because I was baking them in a small toaster oven and they were too close to the element? I will probably put them on a lower rack and try a lower temperature for longer next time. So yum though. Thanks for sharing the recipe:)",

To get more of a brownie I cut the eggs in half (to 2) and added 6 oz. melted white choc. instead of 3 (but that might not even be necessary I just love white chocolate). You do have to cook it a bit longer probably closer to 45 mins just keep checking it. They turned out amazing!!",
