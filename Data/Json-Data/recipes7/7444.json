I did the cooking for most parties at the park, including snacks for our golf group which met twice a week after golf. Brian told me about the Push Cart Onions and I tried them with the group. They loved them. You can play with this recipe to suit your taste. Add more or less sugar, maybe a little more hot sauce, etc.",

If I was to do this again I would use slightly more ketchup and less chili powder. Not that there is alot to begin with but. My husband did not like the sauce. He said that if the onion were diced he might like it better. I am giving it a 5 because the recipe was followed and it was what it was supposed to be.",

I did use the optional green pepper and I thought that was a great addition! I was skeptical on using the cinnamon and almost didn't but decided to and it was fine (couldn't really taste it). Great flavor and not too spicy which is why my mom loved them so much. I will definitely be making these again and again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
