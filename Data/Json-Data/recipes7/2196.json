Simply reduced the white sugar to 1 cup when making the syrup as the pineapple is packed with sweetness. Used a fresh juicy whole pineapple instead of canned. Two-thirds of pineapple processed in a Vitamix blender to get a smooth and frothy mixture and remaining portion pulsed several times so that there would be some small pieces of pineapple. This turned out great and was plenty sweet for our tastes. Thank you CALLALILLIE for sharing this refreshing summer treat.",
