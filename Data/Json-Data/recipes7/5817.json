                "reviewBody": "I really screwed this one up the first time through:) Always good to remember to add the sugar! But I also cooked the cherries per the directions and ended up accidentally caramelizing them. So the second time I made it it came out pretty well. I used about 2.5 cups of cherries the second time and simmered them on medium low heat (3.5 on my electric) with 1.5 T of butter and a little extra sugar - rounded tablespoon. This produced a lot more juice. I think if I make it again though I'd use even more cherries because where it has juice and cherries it's the tastiest. Also I pulled it out at 35 minutes instead of the 40 recommended. I think it may have been done before that though - I'll experiment with times for the next time I make it. I'd also probably try adding vanilla and a little dash of salt to bring out more flavor in the cake itself. The cake is not terribly moist but it's flavorful. It's not overly sweet and tastes great with ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce. I think it would also be great with whipped cream or a powdered sugar glaze. I think it'd be good with blueberries too - I may try that next time. Update: Made this a 2nd time and added almond extract used different cherries and added a streusel. Wow! Delicious - moist and flavorful.",

My changes after reading other's reviews: I used a full cup of plain greek yogurt added a tsp almond extract to the batter and increased the cherries to 2 1/2 cups. The only thing I plan on doing differently next time is use even more cherries. I think this needs at least 3 cups of pitted cherries. Excellent recipe!",

I subbed melted coconut oil for the olive oil, used a heaping half cup of white sugar, mixed a half cup of honey in with the coconut oil, 3 cups of cherries with a heaping tablespoon each of white sugar and honey, added a half teaspoon of almond extract and about 8 oz (by weight) of plain greek yogurt.  Did not drizzle top of cake with olive oil, but did add a crumb topping of butter, white and brown sugars, and flour, then drizzled that with about a tablespoon of honey before putting in the oven (took 40 minutes to bake up).  That cake was GONE at our family lunch.  The cake was wonderfully moist, spongey, and light, with just enough sweetness.",
