Some people may have issue with the batter staying on but I've found that if you let the chicken rest for a few minutes with the batter on it will stick much better. I didn't use a whole quart of buttermilk I just eyeballed how much I would need to cover the tenders in a freezer bag and then just put all the ingredients right into the bag no need to dirty a bowl! After letting the chicken marinade (I so far have only done it for a few hours) I just ran my fingers down the tender to get most of the buttermilk off and then it was straight into the flour which I seasoned with garlic salt onion salt pepper and some chili powder. Then dipped into the egg and into the seasoned flour where i really pressed the bread crumbs into the chicken. I flipped the chicken really pressed it again and then set it aside to rest for a few. Everyone loved them! I served them with the Country Sausage Gravy recipe and people went nuts!",

Then I followed the breading directions using 2 eggs and 1 cup flour with the seasonings. I added red pepper flakes because I like it with a touch of heat. Letting them rest on a cooling rack while the fat heated helps the coating stick. (I added some butter to the fat for flavor.) Frying for 2-3 minutes per side was perfect. I kept them on the rack while I cooked the rest. I served these with milk gravy made with 1.5 cups of milk. The amount came out perfectly Three adults and two small children ate every bite. The kids asked for seconds. I think this is just the way Mom and Grandma made this old fashioned dish. It was yummy.",
