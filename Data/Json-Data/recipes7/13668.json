Are used Betty Crocker devil\u2019s food mix so ended up using a little more oil and three eggs but otherwise essentially followed the recipe. Baking time for me was almost 50 minutes but I think that was because I used a little smaller casserole dish. I think this recipe is worth trying for someone who is willing to experiment a little with their dessert desires.",
