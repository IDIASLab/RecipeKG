First I will disclaim that while I am not a novice pie person neither am I one of those I can throw a pie together in 15 shakes people. I was very doubtful about the double crust on the bottom so I didn t attempt it at Thanksgiving. I was afraid it might be doughy and I could not readily find another example of that method. A single crust came out perfect with a candied crispness. Next time I will try the double crust. I used 9 pans (I made two) but had way too much rum filling use a DEEP DISH 9 pan. The cheese layer floated ABOVE the corn syrup/rum layer which I didn t expect. It s very delicious. I might switch to either brown sugar and/or dark corn syrup in the custard and add lemon or orange zest to the cream cheese in the future. (I had so much rum custard left over that I made a small pecan pie with the remaining rum custard. DELICIOUS!!",
