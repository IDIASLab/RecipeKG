I say best because I've often had difficulty baking muffins that actually puff up tall in the pans when baking, and this definitely makes delicious, springy, moist muffins.\n\nI agree with a few posters that some additional liquid can be used, which was my method for baking.  However, I don't think this takes away from the recipe because it may have to do with the freshness of the peaches used.  Very ripe fresh peaches would not require as much liquid to make a substantial batter.\nI have also tried baking the recipe as a loaf, and that came out equally as good.\n\nI also think this is a very solid recipe that is open to changes - some cranberries or nuts would make nice additions.  But on its own, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.",

If I were to make this again, I'd add a teaspoon of vanilla as well and maybe add some pureed peaches as well in place of some of the oil called for in this recipe and to make up for some of the liquid that's missing. For a half recipe, I got 12 muffins that were on the small side. I baked mine at 350 and they were done a just under 20 minutes.",
