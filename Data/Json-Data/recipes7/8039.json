This recipe gave a great, quick method to cook it, as well as enough description for me to cut/prep it easily.  I do not have Chinese five-spice, but added 2 T. Thai sweet chili sauce instead.  Wow!  I did add green peppers and omitted the onion; I think that would have been a bit much with the onion-y flavor of the bok choy.  My kids were not fans, but the hubby LOVED it. Thank you so much for a great starting point!",

This was a hit for my family, and very easy to prepare, even with two distracting kids in the kitchen.  I use chinese five spice a lot in my cooking, and my whole family, even my three year old, enjoys the flavor.  I cooked two cubed chicken breasts in a skillet with oil, salt, pepper and five spice, then removed the chicken and most of the juice from the pan.  I then cooked the bok choy, onion, and one sliced red pepper that I needed to use up, according to this recipe, adding the chicken back to the pan after five minutes, and cooking everything together for 3 minutes.  I was a little worried that 8 minutes would be too long to cook the greens, but with the thicker stem, the sliced onion, and the red pepper, 8 minutes was perfect to get everything nice an cooked without being mushy.  I'll hang on to this recipe to refer to the oil/five spice/sugar ratio and cook times for future dinners.",
