You can taste both the lime and the nutmeg (a spice I generally don't care for) yet the two combine and blend to create a delicious flavor all its own. Be careful not to overbake these - -you don't want them brown around the edges. Once the cookies have set and are just beginning to turn color along the edge they're done! Any longer than that and you'd more than likely end up with an overly crunchy cookie. Beautiful cookie too all light and sparkly with its sugar/nutmeg finish. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed something so different so much. I will make them again for sure and I won't change a thing!",

When it came to the spiced sugar mixture to dip the cookie into I used turbinado sugar vs. white sugar just to add a little extra crunch on top. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe. It's definitely different and something I'd be happy to make again.",
