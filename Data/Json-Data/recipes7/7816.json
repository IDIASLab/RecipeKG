I don't think these would be good for kids as they ardent very sweet and the coffee taste is quite pronounced.. which is good for me",

Extremely time consuming and it took me almost an hour not 30 minutes. Then letting it cool to room temp? I'm sorry I don't want my brownies to take 3 hours to make! When they were finally done I do have to say they were delicious. The coffee taste is definitely there without being too overpowering. But does it really justify all that time spent? I'm not too sure. The only issue I had with the finished product is that they were still a bit too cakey for my liking but I think that could be fixed by using just a little less flour. I can definitely tell they're caffeinated so don't eat too many before bed!",
