One change I made though since I didn't have caramel sauce on hand was to substitute 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce instead and it turned out very well. Also cuts a lot of sugar out of the recipe if you're watching that. Either way thanks for the easy to follow and make recipe! I will definitely be using this as my go-to recipe.",
