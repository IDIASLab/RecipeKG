It's always a hit (with some minor adjustments)!\nPersonal notes: (1) you can't use enough apples.  Pack that spring form full!  (2) Cooking the apples beforehand makes them a bit mushy.  We prefer them intact: skip that step.  (3) When layering apples, sprinkle each layer with cinnamon.  (4) Parchment paper over the bottom section of the spring pan makes to easily move this onto a plate/cutting board to serve.",

Whatever I kept going. I simmered the apples for longer and added more cinnamon cloves and butter along with water for a juicer mix. I spread the gooey crust stuff on the bottom of a buttered 9x9 ( I hate spring forms) followed with the apples then dolloped the rest of the mix on top. It baked nicely and tasted really good....just nothing crumb about it. I served it warm with a bit of ice cream. I will do this again but use cold butter and cut it into the flour mix for a crumbly outcome. Thank you for sharing!",
