I first tried it at an Asian restaurant. I loved it so much that I looked everywhere on the internet to find a mock version. With a little tweaking I came up with this recipe that tastes just like the original. I served it to my inlaws, and now they think I am an amazing chef.",

                "reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite novelty Chinese dishes. Even though it s labeled a shrimp dish the main ingredient is actually broccoli and it s served in a sweet rich cream sauce. If I could I would give this sauce 10 stars but as for the rest of the recipe it s obvious there is something wrong. (A publishing error maybe?) I can t imagine 16oz of shrimp and only 1 cup of broccoli making enough to serve 8 people yet there is enough sauce to cover everything 10x over. The sauce should coat not drown everything. So I pretty much followed the recipe exact but used 8 cups of broccoli. I did the shrimp a little different by butterflying them and using flour instead of cracker crumbs. For anyone new to this dish I recommend you add the sauce last and only add what your taste buds will allow. It is sweet and can quickly take over if you add too much. If you re really unsure about putting time and money into a recipe you might not like I suggest you start with the sauce. Cut the recipe in half and try it over broccoli. If you like it then go the extra mile and add the shrimp and walnuts. If you don t like it make some magic bars banana pudding or something out of the can of left over sweetened condensed milk.",
