We have returned to Naples and further traveling after a very brief \"pit-stop\" home, just long enough to check on things and to gather up some rhubarb from my yard to pack in my suitcase.  If I can't be home for all the benefits of spring, at least I can take some with me!  While this rhubarb bread recipe is a fairly standard one, I'm happy to be the first to review it and  report that it does not diminish the fact that they (I baked this as muffins) delivered all I hoped they would.  It is a great recipe.  They are flavorful, moist, with just the right amount of rhubarb and spice and no distracting or \"creative\" add-ins.  The topping is generous, stays put on the muffin and is delightfully crispy-crunchy.  Mostly, they were the little taste of good, home baking Hubs and I have been missing.  (One recipe produced 16 standard sized muffins.  Bake at 350 degrees, about 25 minutes)",

The third time - I rocked it by adding somewhere between 3/4 and a cup of chopped walnuts.   Awesome!",

The next time around I am going to skip the topping all together and incorporate the cinnamon in with the batter and cut the sugar down a bit as well. I guess it all depends on your preference and we like to try and keep the sugar down in this house so if you're the same way, try to cut down in the sugar and you should love these!",

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, but next time I'm going to add at least 1/2 cup more rhubarb. It's perfectly fine as is, but I think that that extra little bit of rhubarb could make it even better. The crumble is a nice added touch, though I personally find it a little too sweet, that's a matter of personal preference however. Everybody loves is and even though I made it about an hour ago, half of it's already gone and my family is demanding I make a second one. The only discrepancy I found in this recipe was the fact that it said to bake it for 1 hour. I had to bake mine for about an hour and 20 minutes for it to actually come together. It is still surprisingly moist considering the length of time that it baked for.",
