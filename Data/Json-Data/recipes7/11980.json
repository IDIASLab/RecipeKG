Okay I did make one big mistake and changed one ingredient-but I think it really is the base recipe that deserves 5 stars (I hate when people make like 10 changes and give the recipe five stars when the original recipe actually stinks-I really don't think that's the case here).  I didn't have lemon extract and I'm not even sure where to find that in the country I live in so I used an edible Lemon essential oil-I think about 10 drops instead. I did use bottle lemon juice because I didn't have lemons-but that is a very minor sub.\n\nThe mistake I made was that I read \"lemon juice\" where it said lemon extract and added it at that point-oops, so I didn't boil the lemon juice.  It was fine though. \n I saw that some reviewers said they didn't rise much- but when I filled my muffin tins 2/3 they rose to the top of the muffin tin -  which is what cupcakes are supposed to do they're supposed to be flat on the top (they aren't muffins that are supposed to go over the top).  \nThe finally result was so lemony, sweet (though in ny opinion not too sweet), and moist.  They were fantastic plain or with a simple vanilla buttercream.\nI have a convection oven so I lowered the temp a bit (150\u00b0C) and I think I cooked them a few minutes longer (about 18 for a clean toothpick).",
