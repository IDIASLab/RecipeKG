        "description": "Great winter soul food, terrific with chops or brats.  Mildly sweet and sour, this dish smells divine and just makes you feel good.  Leftovers, if that's possible, are even better and keep well. Coriander seeds lend just the right mysterious note and a few go a long way.  However, any of the herb seeds (mustard, dill, and celery are all good)  or combinations thereof are great for variety. This is a rustic dish, so don't fuss with your chopping -- everything, including the bacon, should be in good-sized chunks, about the same size.",

Was still awesome.This dish had a different flavor and texture with every bite.
