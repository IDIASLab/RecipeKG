In addition to not being as dark chocolate as I assumed it would be, it wasn\u2019t as moist or sweet as I would have liked either.  It cries out, then, for a sweet buttercream frosting.  I made this as cupcakes; a half recipe gave me 12 perfectly shaped and nicely rounded cupcakes. I frosted them with \u201cMint Buttercream Frosting with Dark Chocolate Glaze,\u201d recipe also from this site. Edit 11-10-12: This was much improved simply by adding 1/4 c. more sugar and using strong, brewed coffee in place of the water.",
