                "reviewBody": "I used half fresh and half frozen mango. I still threw some ice in but don't think it was needed. I have to agree with gramcracr -- the bigger greenish/red/yellow type produce twice as much mango as the smaller yellow ones so it's going to make a huge difference the type of mango used. I think this would be awful with one of the smaller ones. The larger ones are about 1-1/2 cups cubed. I used one small and then filled in the rest of that measurement with frozen. I tasted plenty of mango and rather than thinking it was too sweet thought it needed the sweetener cause mango isn't sweet. (Needs sugar or juice that's sweet or something.) Using the bigger mango this was fairly good though there are other mango smoothies I like better. But it's worth a try if you use enough mango. (Though blame can be put on the recipe -- when something varies in size so much a measurement/weight needs to be given not how many!)",
