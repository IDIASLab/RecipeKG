It was more like barely sweet milk.  I then added 1 cup heavy cream, an additional 1/2 cup sugar, an additional tsp of nutmug, a sprinkle of allspice, and 2 tsp of rum flavoring.  I remixed the entire batch then chilled.  Then, it was a winner- my family loved it.  Next time, I'll likely a mixture of cream, half-n-half, and milk to get the rich texture that is most like traditional eggnog.  Thanks for the recipe, I had no idea eggnog was so simple to make.  We cannot buy it where we live, so this was a real treat!!",
