I keep about a half dozen pasteurized eggs on hand because I do like them in the smoothies, so I used one of them for this smoothie.  My strawberries were really sweet, so I added just a bit of sugar, used skim milk, and added a lot of crushed ice (I like a thicker texture).  Dianaa_, this was very good, and will be put into my breakfast and afternoon smoothie rotation.",
