                "reviewBody": "This pumpkin pie was a great hit with my family. Made it gluten-free by using a store-bought Mi-Del gluten-free crumb crust. I'd made this same pie previously and it was a bit too sweet. This time I reduced the sugars by half using evaporated milk in place of the sweetened condensed milk and eliminating the added sugar. 2/3 c. maple syrup was the only sweetener used. This made everything more liquid so I increased the ground chia to a total of 2/3 c. Chia tends to dull the intensity of spices so I doubled the amount of vanilla and cinnamon and added 1 T. cardamon 1 t. allspice and 1/4 t. mace. The clove and nutmeg amounts should also be increased for a more intense pumpkin pie flavor. Baking this pie as instructed at 325 for 40 minutes gives the pudding a wonderful texture with cracking around the edges. No one could tell that this was an egg-less filling. The recipe as modified made more pudding than would fit in the pie crust. The pudding leftover could simply be refrigerated for an hour and eaten cold. But I poured the extra into a ramekin and baked it along with the pie. It came out great!",
