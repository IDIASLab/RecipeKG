I adapted this recipe for the slow cooker by placing 1 1/2 lb boneless frozen breasts in the slow cooker with cumin, adobo, taco seasing and a cup of Goya tomato/chicken boullion, cooked seven hours, removed the chicken and drained the juices through a seive, then added the shredded chicken, recipe ingredients, and some strained broth back in the slow cooker.  I added a can of chopped green chilis too.  A definite do-over!  Thanks, Goya.",

But after tasting I added some additional spices (more ancho garlic powder onion powder more orgegano tumeric) as well as some salsa verde and it came together nicely... it was a five-star then and I'll definitely make again but definitely check the seasonings after the chicken has cooked in the sauce for about 10 minutes...
