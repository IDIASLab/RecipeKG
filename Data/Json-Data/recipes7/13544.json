For the most part I followed the recipe but found that liquid was needed after adding all the ingredients listed in step 2. I google'd \"rhubarb chili\" found other recipes online and saw they all listed 2 or 3 cups of broth so I added 3 cups chicken broth. My other changes made due to what I had on hand: 1 pound lean ground beef (rather than turkey); 2 cans of Great Northern Beans (rather than black) 1 can diced tomatoes and halved fresh cherry tomatoes (rather than 2 cans) & 2 smallish ears fresh corn (rather than 1 cup frozen). Lastly I increased a few spices a bit for more flavor - 4 garlic cloves & 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Good the first day but better the next.",
