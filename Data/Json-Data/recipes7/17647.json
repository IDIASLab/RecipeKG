I wanted to make 12 chocolate croissants instead of 6 so I followed Chef John's recipe for regular croissants (which is pretty much the same as this one except double) and then switched over to follow the instructions for adding the chocolate.  I didn't roll the dough out quite long enough so my croissants were a bit short and stubby, but the flavor and texture were there so I don't care as much about the looks.  I'll do better on that next time!  It helped me to watch and pause each section of the video as I went along.  Chef John has made me feel more confident about making pastries!",

I suspect the problem (apart from my inexperience) was the 8 by 8 inch butter slab (and corresponding dough rectangle) in this recipe. Really seemed to roll out pretty slim compared to other laminates I've experimented with. Butter was almost a smear! After baking these I read your croissant recipe and noticed the measurements of butter and dough rectangles are identical to those in this recipe but with twice the amounts of each to work with. Was this intentional? I think I'll try your croissant recipe tomorrow and I suspect with a slab of butter twice the thickness to start with the result will be improved. Appreciate the humor in your videos. My wife and I chuckle over just about any of them we watch:) Redshoes",

The first time I rolled the dough with the butter slab I panicked with the butter started to squirt out the sides and a few croissants kept trying to unroll themselves as they continued to rise on the sheet. The end product was still delicious and (I think) reasonably attractive. I took them to a winery for a picnic. Thanks Chef John!
