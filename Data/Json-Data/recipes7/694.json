This cake is perfect and mouth-watering good in every way. I used fresh strawberries for the filling and added water to compensate, enough so as it cooked and thickened it was about the consistency of canned cherry pie filling (which, by the way, would also make a good filling for this cake).  I also added a few drops of red food coloring to give it a good, rich red color.  To tell the truth, I forgot to add the lemon juice but I'm glad I did, as there is plenty of tartness in the rhubarb.  That filling is so good Hubs ate it on some vanilla ice cream as I was waiting for it to cool!  The cake is rich, buttery and moist. Could there be any doubt with all that butter and buttermilk? Out of this world...  And the topping, ohhh, the topping -  buttery, sugary, and a little crunchy.  You will not find a better coffee cake.  And I don't mean just Strawberry Rhubarb Coffee Cake.  I mean ANY coffee cake.  Not at Starbucks.  Not at Grandma's.  Not anywhere.  I will keep this cake in mind for the future and will love to try other fillings when strawberries or rhubarb aren't available.  In the meantime, 'tis the season to make the most of strawberries and rhubarb and this is the perfect recipe for that.",

Then dollop the topp of the filling with the batter and don't worry too much if the top is not covered but do cover the top very well with the topping - which turns sweet-crunchy! My only remark (and not complaint) is that the coffee cake is so good that it overwhelms the filling - even though I used a quart of freshly sliced strawberries to make the cake. This cake is sure to be a crowd pleaser!",

I did have to make a few changes; used fresh strawberries (approx. 15 ounces) and because I didn't have any buttermilk I subbed light cream with a touch of lemon juice added. I also added nutmeg to the batter used brown sugar instead of white for the crumb topping and also added cinnamon to it. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream this was absolutely satisfying. I will most certainly be making this again.",

I love the fact that you cook the filling separate and then add it to the cake as a middle layer. I ended up making this in a Bundt pan and didn't use all the filling maybe half of it. It took about 48 minutes to bake and came out delish. I added chopped pecans to the topping and a tich of cinnamong and I also added about a tsp of cinnamon to the cake batter after reading some reviews saying it was bland the addition of the cinnamon nicely complimented the strawberries and rhubarb. With making it in the Bundt pan I had to reverse the order of the layering (put crumb topping in the bottom of the pan and then cake batter topping and cake batter) served it with ice cream for Father's Day dessert it was very well received and as I said above a nice change from the standard pies!:) Thanks for the great recipe!",

I think next time I will double the filling (or half the cake), but reduce the sugar as hubby and I both prefer our rhubarb more tart than sweet.  Also, for the topping I might sub brown for the white sugar and add cinnamon as others have suggested.  \n\nJust a hint for the layer of batter on top of the filling - the batter is rather thick so spreading is a bit of a challenge, but if you just glob it on randomly and then flatten your globs a bit with a spoon (you will still see quite a bit of filling uncovered) it really does bake up nicely to cover the filling.",
