(Never have maple flavoring but I ALWAYS have Almond) and I also tossed in a shake of cinnamon. Although very runny it's good. But VERY VERY Sweet. Use just enough to soak into the pancake. UPDATE Made it again cutting the sugar by 1/2 cup and using the Maple flavoring. Worth the trip to the store for the Maple Flavor!",
