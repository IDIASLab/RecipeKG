They came out fudgy in the middle, chewy on the outsides, and had a crisp crust on top, i would definitely recommend adding extra coffee for standard instant coffee for a stronger flavor, but they came out absolutely delicious without any added frosting (opted for no frosting on the first go round). I added chocolate chips over the top before i put it in the oven, and it added a really good extra chocolate flavor to them. definitely will be making these again :)",
