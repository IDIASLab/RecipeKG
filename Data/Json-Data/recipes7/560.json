As I was creaming the butter and sugar together the butter had looked like wayyyy too little as it was only 1/2 cup to 2 cups sugar and so I threw in 1/2 cup of cream cheese and creamed it with the sugar until fluffy. Also instead of baking it in 3 pans I baked it in a bundt pan. The result a wonderful scrumcious yummy moist cake. Everyone loved it!",

I put it in a bundt pan and it came out beautiful. I cut the frosting in half and I still had plenty left over. I must say that the frosting was of a too soft consistency and was almost running off the cake. I have had better cream cheese frosting. I will use my own recipe for that the next time. I also used the whole can of cherries.(Comstock) The cake was super moist. Next time I'll maybe get 2 cans of cherries drain the sauce off 1 can and add some whole cherries to it. I would like more cherry flavor. I took leftovers to work and the girls all flipped over it. My family really enjoyed it too. Great recipe and thanks for sharing!",

The only thing I changed was less sugar in the icing (probably only 2-3 cups of powdered sugar) as I am not a huge fan of super sweet frosting. I also added candied cherries on top of the canned cherry filling as I liked biting into big hunks of cherries. I would recommend this to anyone.",

What was disappointing to me was the texture it was more like a gingerbread-type texture a little on the dry side. And it sort of tasted like gingerbread!

You really can't taste the cherry but I did top mine with cherries and that added a lot. The frosting is great! I cut it in 1/2 and it was just enough to frost the cake with a little left over.",

I could categorize Carrot Cake into the same class. Carrot Cake might be better from the pineapple you include in it. But I liked the cherry better with the icing I put on instead of the cream cheese stuff it says. Coconut Pecan Frosting is what I went with. Which is on here call Coconut Pecan Frosting II? I think... The photo when you click on it has a cupcake with the frosting. The coconut goes great with the cake. It makes it all-round better. Give it a try. I'm usually hard to impress. This cake with the German Chocolate frosting delivers.",
