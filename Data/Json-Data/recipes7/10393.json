I had to add about another 1/3 cup of water to the dough when mixing, but that happens when making bread sometimes. I upped the yeast to 2 tsp as the amount called for seemed like a small amount for whole wheat bread. I loved that this bread was not crumbly, even several days later. Thanks to the submitter for a nice whole wheat bread recipe.",

It had no effect on the delicious flavor of this bread.",
