I often make Biscotti for my family, so I used some of those methods and applied them to this recipe.  1.  I mix the chocolate chips and slivered almonds in with the flour.  This assures an even distribution in the finished cookie.  2.  After mixing all the ingredients, I refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes.  This makes it not so \"sticky\", and easier to work with.  3.  I dump the dough onto a floured bread board and then form it into two logs.  Be sure to flour the bread board.  I then transfer the logs to a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper.  I always use parchment paper.  Use a pastry brush to brush off any excess flour from the top of your logs.  4.  I bake my logs in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, to get some color on the logs.  5.  I remove the logs from the oven and let them rest for 15 minutes so they are easy to handle.  Leave your oven on at 350 degrees while the logs are cooling.  6.  Slice the logs at an angle, so you get longer slices.  Return the slices to the baking sheet, standing them on their bottoms, not laying on their sides.  7.  Return the sliced logs to the oven for 15 more minutes.  Cool.  Enjoy.",
