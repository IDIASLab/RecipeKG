The only modification I made was 2 cups of flour instead of 1 3/4. Also, I made a batch following the instructions carefully, and another batch where I mixed the 2 eggs with the sugar, butter and vanilla all together, then added the milk, then the flour. Both batches came out exactly the same- so no need to follow all those steps.. :). Muffins came out nice and fluffy, with a crispy top- just excellent! Will sure keep as a favorite!
