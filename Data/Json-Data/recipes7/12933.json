Also great on-the-go! Delicious and includes many foods that are a great way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and yogurt, are optional and vary depending on your own taste. I love cinnamon and a thick, super-cold smoothie. This recipe is super versatile, and you can change it depending on dietary needs or personal preference. Have fun with it!",

I used Oikos nonfat Greek yogurt. For the OJ, I used Tropicana Trop 50 (low cal/low sugar) and I only used 1tsp of sugar instead of 1tbsp (I don't like my smoothies too sweet). This ended up being 188 cals instead of 295 cals, with these ingredients and the reduced sugar. The vanilla was a nice touch, and I might even increase it to 1/2 tsp.  Very versatile and healthy! Thanks Lisa Marie for sharing!",

I used frozen blueberries (I didn't have fresh). I used a small container of strawberry Greek yogurt and added a little bit of nonfat milk. I don't ever have juice in the house so I used the juice of half a lemon. Added a little bit of sugar and a little honey. Omitted the vanilla extract but did add a dash of cinnamon and since my blueberries were frozen I omitted the ice. End result was one of the best smoothies I have ever had. The consistency was absolutely perfect and the lemon made it tangy but it was still sweet. Thanks to this recipe and all the variations you can do with it I don't see myself ever buying another smoothie again.",
