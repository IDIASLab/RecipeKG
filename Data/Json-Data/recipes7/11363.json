                "reviewBody": "I've not had great success with quick pizza dough in the past, because most of them have no chew to speak of and are either bread-y or like a cracker, depending on thickness. This dough is different. I used the full 2 TBLS of yeast specified, and bread flour, as it's what I had. I had to add almost another full cup of flour before I could even begin to knead it. I do live in Tampa, though, and it's June. Very humid here. After just about 10 minutes rise time, I ended up with enough dough to make two 13\" pizzas. I paired them with a quick batch of Exquisite Pizza Sauce, another excellent AR recipe. I baked them at 550\u00baF on a pizza stone set on the bottom rack of my oven. The baked pies yielded puffy edges with a nice stretchy chew, just what a good pizza should be. This is the first quick dough I've felt comes close to my overnight cold rise dough. From start to finish, I had two excellent pizzas in under an hour.  I think a 30 minute rise will make it even better, yielding even more oven spring and lots of puffy holes. Still, it's excellent as is. Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",

I started out w/ the flour as stated, but ended up adding in an extra cup to get it to come together, and almost another cup kneading it, until it was easy enough to handle. Once risen (I let it go about 1/2 hour and it rose beautifully), the dough was so soft and wonderful to work with. Very easy and delicious, just know that you may need more flour than called for. I will def be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I didn't have any quick-rise yeast, so I just used 2-1/4 tsp of active dry yeast that I buy in bulk, and let it rise about an hour. I also used tipo \"00\" flour that I brought back from Italy with us on our last trip there. I did follow the submitter's review regarding the amount of flour, and needed to add a bit more than the 4 cups total (probably due to the fact that tipo \"00\" is a finer flour). I wasn't sure how many pizzas this would make, and what size. I made mine on a 1/2 sheet pan (18\" x 13\"), and it ended up being a pretty thick crust pizza (like focaccia). It was really good, but I think next time I will make two pizzas (round) and roll it out  thinner and bake it on a stone. Definitely enough dough for more than one pizza. It was really good, and I'd make it again.",
