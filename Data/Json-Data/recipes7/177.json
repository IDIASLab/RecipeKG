My only suggestion would be to try and match your \"salt-free herb and spice blend\" to the other ingredients in the meal or you're going to have some weird flavors. I used Garlic & Herb flavored Mrs. Dash and it was a bit Italian-y in retrospect. (My other choices were Italian Medley Mrs. Dash and Tomato-Basil Mrs. Dash. I made do with what there was.) I have no way of knowing what product the original poster meant for us to use and that's too bad but on the bright side that gives you the leeway to turn this basic dressing into a good one for ANY themed salad! Thank you for sharing your recipe:)",

I have some dressing left and will try to see if adding some Dijon mustard to it will help. It's been a long time since I had iceberg lettuce only in a salad and after I took a few bites I added some leafy greens. This was a good way to use up a little leftover chicken. Thanks for the possibilities this created for us.",
