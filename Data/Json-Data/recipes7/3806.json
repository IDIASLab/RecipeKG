The only things I did differently are the following: I added a little bit of mozzarella cheese to each roll, I cut the sugar in half (hubby didn't like them so sweet, but I thought they tasted good), and I added minced garlic to the dough. None of the changes I made were necessary, but I feel they made the rolls taste better in the end.  These pepperoni rolls keep well and warm up well so I appreciate that this recipe makes 20. Fantastic!\n\n*Edit: I took another reviewer's advice and brushed the tops of the rolls with egg and sprinkled them with garlic powder and oregano. This made the rolls look so professional. My husband told me that when he took them in to work for his lunch, he had someone ask him where he'd bought them.",

Since I had lost the recipe, I luckily found yours!! I did make just a couple tiny alterations-not with the dough! Just in using a small block of mozzarella on top of the pepperoni & a sprinkle of garlic powder; then after sealing, in a small bowl I placed 4 slices of pepperoni & a couple tbl. of butter and microwaved it till it infused the melted butter with the pepperoni. I then brushed that on top of the rolls, sprinkled with alittle garlic powder & popped in the oven. After baking I brushed them again with the \"pepperoni butter\" and I have to say they were GONE in minutes. So fast that I had to make another batch! Thanks!!!",
