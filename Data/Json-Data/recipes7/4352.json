It's not to sweet - a little dry but fanstatic as it does not weigh you down. There is a perfect blend of eggnog and rum. However I must tell you that I used the eggnog with the alcohol already mixed in just to give it a little extra kick. I could not find currants though so I substituted raisins. I also did not use almonds and instead used pecan halves. I do believe I will make a rum glaze for the top for an added flavor and I was perhaps thinking of mixing nutmeg in with the recipe. Overall I will be making this again as the only I made was just for a taste test. Our party is in 2 days and I will make a fresh one and let you know what the guests' say!",

I only did one thing different: I was short on raisins so I made up the difference with Craisins. Craisins soaked in rum is a good thing. The texture of the bread is a bit on the crumbly side but is not as crumbly after it cools. I plan to use the leftovers to make a baked eggnog french toast casserole for Christmas morning breakfast.",
