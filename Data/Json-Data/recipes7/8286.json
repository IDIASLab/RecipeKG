Now I keep getting questioned when I'm making them again.

Going to experiment with dried blueberries and cranberries and other nuts eventually.",

For the reviewer who asked about the Amaretto it cannot be tasted in the dough. It enhances the taste of the cherries and that's about it. I do agree adding a little almond flavoring would be interesting to test. Thanks PJ's Kitchen for a wonderful recipe!",
