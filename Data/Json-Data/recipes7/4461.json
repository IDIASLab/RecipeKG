I am a Gma from the south and although this has been prepared numerous times with southern families mine was not one of them! DH had mentioned several times how much he would love to have pigs feet and told me I could cook them using the basic ingredients I use for a favorite chicken/pork adobo recipe that we both love. When I found fresh pigs feet in our market I knew the time had come. Your recipe filled the need for the instructions. I got a great review from him and I only want to pass it on to you. Thank you for making my DH a happy camper!! He said it reminded him of home. You just can't top that!!",
