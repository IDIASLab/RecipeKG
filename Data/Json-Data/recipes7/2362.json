Sine there is extra egg in place of the usual oil and no baking soda/powder, the result is an intensely rich, decadent brownie. I used milk chocolate chips and used 1 1/2 c. white sugar and 1 1/2 c. brown sugar. I have found that this adds a more saturated, special flavor. The best way I have found to melt sticks of butter is to place them in a large, microwaveable Tupperware cup and microwave them for 30+ seconds. By doing this, you don't have to go through the hastle of cutting the butter. Also, in place of sifting the flour mixture, all you need to do is whisk it. Whisking produces the exact same effect/texture as using a conventional sifter, plus it is much easier to clean! I highly reccomend this recipe. You have got a winner with this one Brooke!",

Next, I didn't have semisweet chocolate morsels, so I chopped up some squares of semisweet chocolate.  Worked just fine.  When I cut up the chocolate, alot was in slivers, so melted & helped form a fudgy synergy!  I'd recommend this & I'll definately make it again.  Maybe try pecans next time.  Also, I used the 9x13 pan recommended; but were kind of thin...so I might try a slightly smaller pan next time & see if I can get them a little thicker, without affecting the gooey light texture.",

Recently I made the Barefoot Contessa's \"Outrageous Brownies\" and another recipe called \"Supernatural Brownies,\" which was featured in the New York Times.  While both of them were tasty,  Brooke's brownies surpassed them.\n\nI would like to add that I didn't alter anything in this recipe.  I did have to bake them a little longer than the recipe stated and was concerned about over baking them, but they turned out perfectly.  The corners (which I usually don't like) were especially delicious and had a nice chewiness to them.\n\nThis recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Brooke!\n\n\n  ",

This is MUCH BETTER overnight as the butter doesn't ooze and the sugar taste becomes more neutral. This is a lot of sugar for my taste so I cut it down to 2 cups and even then it was sweet. Something I learned from a chef I knew: Beat your eggs till they go a light yellow then gradually add the sugar. Mix your cocoa and butter or dark chocolate (with a v high cocoa %) in a microwave or over the stove. Let it cool then fold into the fluffy egg mix and then slowly fold in the flour. For some reason this always ensures I have fudgey brownies and never dry ones. ",
