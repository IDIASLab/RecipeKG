As written this needs some vanilla and possibly cinnamon or nutmeg if you like a little more flavour. I used a porridge oat blend for the oats and cereal called for. These are dense biscuit like cookie which is partly to do with all the baking powder. I think you can eliminate all the baking powder in this cookie unless you like that biscuit taste. My kids loved them and have been eating them in their lunchbox all week! Thanks for sharing all your cookies with us over the years here Cheerios!",
