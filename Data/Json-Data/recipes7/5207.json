This turned out to be the best mince pie I've ever tasted! Even non-mince pie lovers said it was delicious. I made it with the following changes: I substituted candied orange peel for the grapefruit peel. Instead of half a ground graham cracker I added a whole ground graham cracker to the filling because my filling needed thickening. The result was perfect thickness once it had cooled. I substituted currants for 1/2 cup of the raisins. I used a graham cracker crust. Those were the only changes I made. I used red delicious apples and made the filling the day before. I kept the filling in the fridge then the following day I put it in the pie shell and baked it. After baking I just let the pie sit at room temp until serving the next day. It did fine at room temp. It sliced beautifully and held its shape. This pie was very easy to make and it was absolutely delicious. We'll definitely never go back to the store bought or \"from a jar\" mince pies again.",
