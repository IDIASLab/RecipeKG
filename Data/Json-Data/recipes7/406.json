It is fast and simple to make. I would say it's a bit like a stir fry with a Thai flavor! Serve on top of cooked brown or classic white rice. Very good with a simple side like mandarin oranges to complete this meal",

My husband and I cooked this one together and we did make just a couple changes that I would recommend...leave out the cornstarch and peanuts and use 3/4 cup of chunky peanut butter instead. It gave it just right flavor, texture, and thickness. If it seems a little thin at first just cook until it thickens. The flavors in this dish really blend well. The cilantro and green onion really gives it the perfect unique taste, and it's not too pea-nutty. We served this over steamed brown rice along with some steamed broccoli. This one is a keeper!     This was my review a couple years ago. Since then I have discovered that this is a lot better served over rice noodles. Also I add broccoli and bean sprouts. The broccoli flavor works really well in this dish. And I also add lime juice to the peanut butter.",

I used canola oil; 2 cloves of garlic (we love it); added chili flakes and about 1 TBS hoison sauce to the soy mixture and finally I didn't use chopped peanuts. Instead I took the advice of other reviewers and used about 3 TBS of chunky peanut butter. At first the whole \"concoction\" looked a bit runny and I started to get worried. But let it simmer for about 10 minutes and you're good. I served this over white steamed rice and the best part is that the peanuty sauce will coat the rice and its mmm good. Boyfriend went back for thirds!!",

This recipe is absolutely top shelf.  I served it with instant white rice.  They only modification I might make is to reduce the peanuts a bit to your own taste.  Two cups is a LOT of peanuts for some folks.  I dig peanuts, so it's okay by me.  The complex, slightly exotic taste of this dish is excellent.  My mother in law didn't like it, but she doesn't go for anything too far off the beaten path.  If appearances count to you, you will love this one.  It's plates up beautifully.  Restaurant quality, indeed.  And delicious!",
