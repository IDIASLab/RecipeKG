I may try a savory version of these using parm and garlic.",

I will probably share this with a friend who just had a baby would be a much cheaper alternative to brand name baby biscuits and crackers if you leave out the spice.",

This makes a nice slightly sweet cracker but is not truly sweet like a cookie. I rolled all of the dough out in a 10x15 inch pan and cut lines every inch going both directions to make 1 inch squares. This seemed to be just about the right thickness and easy to break into tiny crackers. Baked 15 minutes until crispy but in retrospect I think they might have been better a little softer. My 1 year old likes them a lot. We use them as rewards for potty-training.",
