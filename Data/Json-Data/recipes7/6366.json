To my horror after an extensive search of the internet I could only fine one, and it was WAY to large for my 2-quart maker. So I came up with one of my own. The result was a surprisingly good substitute for the expensive brand! Because of the liqueur it takes a bit longer to harden than the recipes without liqueur, but the wait is worth it!",

I packaged it in a freezer container and presented it to my mother for Mother's Day along with a batch of homemade ice cream cones from this site. She absolutely LOVED it! How do I know it was good? Don't tell.I snuck a scoop! I will be making this again soon. Thank you Brandee for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!",
