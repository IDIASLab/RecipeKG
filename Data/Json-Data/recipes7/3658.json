I browned and drained the meat then just tossed everything except the cheese, stirred that in just before serving. Tastes a lot like bbq sauce to me. This is a real crowd pleaser being that the recipe makes 6 qts. Served it with mini corn muffins. I will make this again, maybe serve over brown rice (like our usual chili).",

I didn t use the sausage because I don t like it and left out the green pepper using roasted yellow and orange ones. I only used half the cayenne and it was plenty spicy on the back of the throat. The sugar and the honey both made this a little too sweet for me. I always add a few tablespoons of sugar when I cook with tomatoes to take out the acid. I thought the cheese would make this a slimy mess but it just dissolved right in there. I cooked stovetop as this sounded like what directions call for even though it says she does it in the crockpot. I have never used masa before and was impressed with it as a thickener. I only made a half batch and got a quart and a half out of it. I m not sure why it calls to add part of the ingredients after you get the meat browned and the onions and peppers soft and then add spices in one at a time. I would add the spices in with the meat and vegetables to flavor the meat then add the rest in and cook it. All in all a nice chili! Thanks for the recipe.",
