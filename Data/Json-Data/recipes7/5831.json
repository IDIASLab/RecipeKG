I made these for my soccer team for tomorrow (I made them today, Friday) and they came out looking BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!!!!!! I baked them just enough so the center was fudgey so it was kind of a surprise in the middle. I added chocolate chips insted of the chocolate squares but they were still unsweetened. My only probably was that there was a lot, and  I mean a LOT of batter. I doubled the recipe as I was making 12 mini cakes instead of 6 but I should've just stuck with the original 6 and added a tiny bit more of everything instead of doubling it completely. I put cream cheese frosting on them and iced them to look like soccer balls and wrote some letter on the too and they looked phenomenal!!!!!!!! I used the extra batter in a yellow cake I was also making for my soccer team and everything worked out great. Thanks for the recipe, Jocelyn, I am definitely making these again!!!!",

The chopped pieces of chocolate mixed into the batter make these little molten pools when the cakes are eaten warm. They're good after cool but will blow your mind when hot out of the oven. Two comments - no way this quantity of batter fits into a regular 6 muffin tin - probably intended for the extra big muffin tin? Otherwise makes 8-9. Also greasing the tins with butter was not sufficient to keep the cakes from sticking and coming apart a little. I'll probably grease AND flour next time. And there will most definitely be a next time.",
