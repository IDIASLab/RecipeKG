I cut it back to 8 servings but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a beautiful flavorful sauce just a tad sweeter than I like. That could simply be the result of the fruit I used (pears can really vary in sweetness) and is easily fixed by adding a portion of the sugar then adding more as needed after the fruit has had time to release its juices. I'll definitely make this again!",

I left it in the fridge for approximately 24 hours but it didn't gel up the way that I thought it would. Also it was delicious but just way too sweet to eat as a side dish. My husband said that it could probably be used as filling or a topping for a dessert because it is very sweet. Although the sweetness bothered us the taste was very good; hence I will be making it again. Next time I will cut back on the sugar and use more cranberries.",
