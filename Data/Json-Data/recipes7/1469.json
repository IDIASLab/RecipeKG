If you use frozen fruit juice concentrate (as recipe indicates), it will be too sweet, guaranteed ~ as some reviewers found out. Instead, use Goya brand \"Frutta - 100% Pure Passion Fruit Pulp\", which is a puree with no sugar or water added. The flat plastic bags of \"Frutta\" can be found in the freezer section of possibly your regular grocer's, & definitely at Hispanic & Asian stores. At a regular grocer look in the freezer with Hispanic or Asian foods, & where frozen juices & fruits are located. ~~~ I highly recommend this to anyone. It is also super simple: 3 ingredients, 1 to 1-1/2 minutes of blending, 30 mins. of refrigeration (for a slightly firmer texture). Amazingly, a serving size in an espresso cup satisfies as nicely as a larger serving in a ramekin. This may very well become your go-to recipe for summertime, for a creamy~dreamy ending to a tropical meal, for special occasions ~ or more often!",

I listed the concentrate juice as I figured that is the main or only way some of you could get passion fruit juice! The BEST  THING TO USE IS THE JUICE FROM THE FRUIT ITSELF, such as we do here in Brazil. Then it will not be so sweet because passionfruit is a very tart fruit, almost like lemon! That is why this recipe also works well with lemon or lime juice. So, certainly, if you use the frozen concentrate...lessen the amount of sweetened cond. milk, but I'm not sure how it will turn out, because then there will be less cream. *By the way, this makes a marvelous ice cream. Just put it in the freezer instead of in the refrigerator-you don't even have to beat it again later. Yummo! *Another option is to use \"light\" cream and \"light\" sw. condensed milk.",
