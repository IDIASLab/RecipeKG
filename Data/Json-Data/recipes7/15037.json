(Hint: Add the icing while cinnamon rolls are still warm. It almost melts into the cinnamon rolls. So good!) And don't let the apple cider vinegar discourage you. I doubled the recipe and they were all gone within an hour.  I will totally triple the recipe next time. I cannot believe how delicious and easy these are. So hard to stop eating this cinnamon goodness. Would give it 10 stars! Only thing is, why does this only make 4?! I've doubled the recipe every time and gotten 9 cinnamon rolls. I pay my little brother a nickel to help me, haha. I love how little time it takes to make.(Who has time in the morning to wait hours for dough to rise?).I'm definitely not a pro baker, (I'm only 12!), but these always turn out perfectly. :)",

Just mix the ingredients together, knead, roll, plop them in the oven, frost , grab a coffee and enjoy! I was skeptical to try this recipe, but I'm sure glad I did!\n\nI almost always mess up when making cinnamon rolls, so when my 5 year old requested cinnamon rolls instead of cupcakes for her birthday, I thought I had better try out a few recipes. These rolls came out perfect for me! They're just the right size for my kiddos. \n\nMy changes: I doubled the recipe  (4 rolls would not have been enough in this house), used bread flour instead of APF (grabbed the wrong bag, oops) and left out the white sugar for the filling (totally forgot to add it). I was able to get 9 lovely rolls, and I baked them in an 8x8 glass baking dish for about 18 minutes. Used a cream cheese frosting  from this site. It was delicious!! Thank you Nina!",

I wasn\u2019t too worried about the appearance of mine, so I just rolled it and cut slices from that. Instead of baking in a muffin tin, I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper. I used a basic glaze (combine 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons milk, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla). Will definitely make these again!",
