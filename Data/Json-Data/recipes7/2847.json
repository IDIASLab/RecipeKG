She always made it for birthday dinners and special occasions.  This makes a large amount.  I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy - sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.  Enjoy!",

My boyfriend was skeptical about the sour cream but it was delicious. He ate almost half the entire dish! I followed the recipe to a T and the only suggestion I would make is boiling the pasta for a little while longer so that it is much softer and easier to cut with a fork when done. It does not quite taste like traditional lasagna, but it will definitely be making its way onto my dinner table again. Thanks! ",

Instead of making the sauce I used a sausage onion spaghetti sauce that I had in the panty (it had chunks of tomato, onion, and sausage in it). I also used a 'hot' pork sausage. After the first bite my husband and i are hooked. I will be making this dish again and again!!! Thank you for sharing!!!",
