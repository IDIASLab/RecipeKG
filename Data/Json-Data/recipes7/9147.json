Like I said above, I have made this at least a dozen times and feel I have perfected it!

I substituted 1.5 tsp of salt for the chicken base but I think it was a tad much and next time I'll do one tsp.  Also used one large and one small garlic clcove instead of the roasted garlic.  It was way garlicky but uber delicious!  I steamed the cauliflower in a fry pan with about a 1/4 inch of water on the bottom, bringing the florets to a boil and covering, simmering for around 10+ minutes.     While that was cooking I combined the other ingredients in my Kitchen Aid bowl.  The flavor of this was amazing!  SO rich, creamy and flavorful  YUM!!!  Made a good amount... 3 of us ate and there are just a little bit of leftovers.",
