I didn't have any cream of celery soup or gravy, so I used a can of cream of chicken soup, and made my own gravy.  1 1/4 c. cold water, 1/2 c. flour, and 3 chick. bouillion cubes.  I arranged half of the potatoes in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, sprinkled 1/2 of the ham, and a few of the onions, and then topped with 1 c. cheese.  I repeated with the remainder of the potatoes and other ingredients, then topped with another cup of cheese and carefully poured the milk, gravy, soup mixture over all of it.  I covered and baked at 400 degrees for 30 min, then removed the foil and baked at 375 degrees for another 30 minutes.  HUGE HIT!!!",
