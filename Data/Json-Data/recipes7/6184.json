So she had to get up quite early in the morning and make loaves of bread and rolls to sell so that she could supplement the income and keep the family going. My mother would deliver them to the neighbors, still hot out of the oven, with a jar of jam. Now I make my living making bread.",

I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast \"bloomed\" then I added melted butter and the dry ingredients. I did run my oats through the mini food processor before using it so my oats would be a finer consistancy. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes (I did have to add a quarter cup more flour to get it into a ball and be able to be kneaded with the hook). I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls (instead of making cloverleaf rolls only because I was short on time) and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I covered the top of the rolls in the muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes then brushed the tops of the hot rolls with vegetable oil right out of the oven. These rolls rose beautifully and turned out very fluffy but the flavor wasn't quite right. I think what I was missing was either more butter or a milk flavor. I would like to try these again but I would maybe use half milk next time instead of all water and maybe up the butter. Honestly four and a half stars. They're almost there.",

If you watch the video you will see that it says to rise in the muffin tins for about 45 min/till doubled. I did and they had good texture and were fluffy and pretty. #2. They were a bit bland as one other reviewer pointed out I accidently used unsalted butter this didnt help with the blandness #3. I used 375 @ 25min. They were toasty brown on top and very lightly golden on bottom and done. #4.This makes a little more then enough dough then 24 rolls. I ended making one dozen- as I had only two 6 ct muffin tins then when i tried them and realised they needed salt I punched down the second batch and kneaded in some salt then let rise again and not wanting to spend time remaking balls I made two loaves instead.
