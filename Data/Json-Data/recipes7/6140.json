I proofed the yeast with the warm water (that I dissolved the coffee granules into) yeast sugar and honey for ten minutes until the yeast \"bloomed\" then added the melted butter and all the dry ingredients. I do NOT have bread flour just regular AP flour. I did not need the vital wheat gluten. This dough was REALLY wet it took another 1 1/4-1/2 cups AP flour to get it to form a ball that I could knead with my dough hook. I kneaded it for five minutes with the dough hook then set it to rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad for a couple hours. I then formed it into large rolls and set the formed rolls into greased muffin tins (one 12-cup muffin tin was just right for me) then covered it with saran wrap and let it rise for 45 minutes on the warm heating pad. After the rolls were done I brushed them with vegetable oil for tender tops. I did not sprinkle the tops with sesame seeds as I didn't have any. I think this recipe is a good recipe I know she was going for a knockoff of the Outback's bread--and it's very close. Very chewy roll recipe with a nice fluffy interior. I think it's a good bread recipe today but the flavors will be even better the next day. I think it's a little too sweet for me now but that might mellow by tomorrow.",

Proofed the yeast (1 pkt of active dry yeast) in warm water (110 degrees F) for about 10 minutes until it reached foamy stage and then added melted butter instant coffee (to dissolve) and honey to the water and stirred it up. I mixed together 1 cup of bread flour 2/3 cup wheat flour sugar salt vital wheat gluten and the cocoa; added this to the mixer bowl and started mixing at a low speed. Then gradually added the remaining 2 cups of flours to reach the right consistency and kneaded for about 4 minutes. Dumped into an oiled bowl and let rise for about an hour. I then formed into rolls and let rise for about another 45 minutes brushed on an egg wash and then into the oven. These soft rolls (definitely not dense) baked up beautifully with a nice flavor and chewy texture. They were just a little doughy in the center but that could be just a matter of difference in oven temperatures. Next time I will bake for an additional 5 minutes. The recipe ingredients were spot on and I did not have to add additional flour. I've not yet baked a lot of rolls and bread but these rank right up there with the best so far.",

I do not recommend putting the breadmaker pan in warm water and it is not necessary.  Please note this dough is very wet, which is correct, so flouring your hands and having a scaper available to \"punch\" the dough and shape the dough is very helpful.  \n\nMY instructions:  After kneading is complete, remove pan and turn machine off. Put pan with dough in a warm place and let rise for 1 hour to twice the size.  (You can turn your oven on 200 degrees for a couple of minutes to achieve the right amount of warmth, then turn it off.  Cover dough with a clean lint-free towel.)\nTurn dough out onto a floured surface and punch down.  Flour hands and shape dough into 12 equal sized balls or 2-3 loaves. Place on a parchment lined cookie sheet.  Sprinkle with your choice of toppings.\nLET RISE AGAIN, usually about 30 minutes, until doubled in size.",

Then I added the honey and let it finish proofing. Next I mixed in the butter instant coffee and cocoa gluten and salt. Using a wooded spoon I mixed in the 2 cups of bread flour. I then added a little more than 1 cups of wheat flour to get the dough to the consistency. I turned it out and kneaded it for 5 or 6 minutes. I let the dough rise for about an hour in the oven with a bowl of hot water underneath it. This makes my cool oven just slightly warm and humid for a good rise. After rising for about an hour just punch down and turn out the dough and shape into balls. Back to the oven we go for a little over 30 minutes to finish rising. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes as directed or until slightly brown. They turned out just fantastic soft with a nice light chewy center. Very good recipe!",
