I used fresh blueberries and peeled local peaches cut into bite-sized pieces.  I poured the fruit into an 8\" X 8\" baking pan (after spraying with butter cooking spray) and sprinkled the fruit with a little lemon juice, 1 TB of flour and a couple of heaping teaspoons of sugar (I got the idea to do this from another blueberry peach crisp recipe on this site).  Then I mixed them together and topped with the topping.  I baked it according to the directions and it came out perfectly.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  This was luscious - both hubs and I really enjoyed it!  I've never made a crisp before and now would definitely make it for company.",

I don't know if it would be as good with frozen, but with fresh fruit I rate it a 5. Easy to make, can whip it up quickly, a relatively healthy and lower calorie dessert (not low cal, but lower than many desserts). Many reviewers wrote that they doubled the topping but that seemed like a lot of sugar and butter to me so I increased the topping by 1/2 and thought this was plenty, and I think even going with the topping as written would be enough. Got rave reviews from family and made it twice in one week due to family request.",
