He doesn't care for normal cake, and his favorite sweet is chocolate chip cookies, so he (and all the rest of the family) loved this. He has asked for it every birthday since. One time when I served it to ten people and there was leftovers, I caught my dad eating it for breakfast the next morning! All lovers of chocolate chip cookies must try it!

I popped the other 2 into the freezer to chill - waited another 20 minutes and then turned them out. Although perfectly cool to the touch they immediately began to sink and crack so presentation was soooo sad (grin). On the plus side they DO taste exactly like soft chocolate chip cookies. But (as mentioned above) they are just SO sweet - nobody could finish even the smallest sliver...I'm so sorry - lovely concept. Having said all that I do think this would be great to make ahead of time (since batter makes 3) and then decorate and serve individually like those cookie-cake bakeries you see in the mall. Final note: someone mentioned not to overcook... perhaps I was too careful with that as well - with final layer I went the full 20 minutes then pulled... that was the best layer of the three.",

(I made half a dozen cookies with the leftover batter). It was a beautiful golden brown and it was delicious!
