Next time I make this and I do want to try it again, I'll cut the squash into smaller pieces, increase the broth to about a cup, use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and add more garlic and onion. I'll also try simmering it in my dutch oven a little longer too. One tip with the butternut: before you do anything pierce the skin of the squash a few times and put it in the oven at about 400* about the time the turkey is done browning you can take the squash out of the oven (it will be hot) and cut the skin off and chop much more easily.

Instead of chilies, I just added one serrano pepper, and cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to keep it spicy.  I also added allspice, and it *really* brought everything together.  i left out the tomatoes, added more beans (I don't like chunky tomato bits).  really though, i really think the allspice made it FABULOUS.  my boyfriend doesnt much care for ground turkey or squash, but he loved it too.

I used more garlic, 1 28oz jar of tomato sauce instead of the original tomato ingredients, I used leftover turkey instead of ground turkey, borrowed another reviewers suggestion to substitute canned corn for hominy, and I used freshly cooked beans instead of canned.  I think the cumin- chili powder- garlic salt proportions are fine as is.  It's got pep; however, it's a pleasant zing, not too pungent or hot.  (Jalapenos are kinda hot for me.  Habaneros are almost too hot for me to eat ever unless they are teamed up with something to counteract the capsicin.  I say this to help define 'not too hot', the 'heat' level for this was like mild to medium salsa.)  I had to extend the cooking time to account for the non canned beans, and I added the turkey (cubed) about halfway through to prevent drying out.  When I made it the recipe filled an 8qt stock pot (1 lb of kidney beans and a lot of leftover turkey is probably why).  My family was unanimous in their approval of the chili/ stew.  I will definitely make this again in the future.",
