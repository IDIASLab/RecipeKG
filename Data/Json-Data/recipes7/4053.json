To pureed beans add 1/2 c. white sugar - transfer to a well oiled fry pan and fry the beans until they reach the consistency of a thick paste. I used the full recipe of bean paste for this cake delicious!",

I've already made it twice. Also tried baking in cupcake pans (24 cupcakes). It does take a longer time to pour mixture into each individual cupcake pans. But I would still make it again w/ the cupcake pans because they'll bake faster (20 mins at 350 degrees) and there won't be any cutting involved. Additionally these cupcakes are easier to reheat after wards (this is only good served warm). Enjoy!: )",

My wife drops teaspoons of the paste about every inch or so into the cake batte; this allows for the taste of the bean paste without overwhelming the sticky cake.",
