It could have been firmer perhaps it is a difference in gelatin brands. I used Knox. When I topped it with the blueberry sauce it fell. I will double the gelatin the recipe calls for next time. For simplicity pie filling could be used for the sauce. I enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice change & could make an elegant finish to a meal.",

One thing I did do was make my own buttermilk which consisted of 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice I m wondering if that s why it s not setting correctly. I changed the recipe for four servings so I m only using 3/4 teaspoon of the gelatin I wish that when you broke down the recipe that it would also break down the in the directions as well.",
