I saw this recipe and loved it and wanted to try, only to find after getting it going that it had such negative reviews but decided to go with it anyway.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding some pepper and it was excellent!  :)  My husband and I LOVED it and our daughter did as well.  It was tender (falling apart) and FULL of flavor.  I used the jellied sauce like the recipe says.  When I do pork roasts I tend to poke the meat all over with a fork before putting it in...this may be why mine had a lot of flavor as opposed to the others who tried it.  All in all - excellent!  Paired with some oven roasted potatoes, delicious!  :)",

I served it with fresh biscuits and everyone from age four on seemed very happy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly!",

Made for a diabetic with hbp I had a 2.5 lb roast so I doubled everything, used cinnamon instead of cloves, splenda instead of sugar (12 pkts) left out the salt and added the juice & zest from 1 orange, tenderized it by poking holes all over the roast & cooked on high for 4 hrs then down to low for 2.  Dad loved it!  It was soooo tender, just fell apart & bursting with flavor all the way through it! It is on the sweeter side of things, so be sure to be in the mood for fruity flavor.",
