I even realized I was out of hot sauce after starting the onions and subbed 2 Tblsp of chili sauce and 2 small pinches of cayenne for half the recipe. I followed the rest of the ingredients as is. I used cooked and sliced Trader Joes all-beef hot dogs and yellow mustard as suggested. I am looking forward to making hot dogs over the next summer holiday with these onions. Having it all on a cracker was fine but the cracker just seemed somewhat dry and on the butter side to me with this combination. Maybe if they sat a little longer the cracker would start to soak up some of the yummy cooked onions. I plan to make more of these as an quick appetizer for Super Bowl. They do present well because of the onions. ty",
