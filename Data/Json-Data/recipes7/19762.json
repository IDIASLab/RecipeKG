The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the center (although cooked all the way and the bottom was a nice golden brown) was completely mushy. If baked longer it would have started to burn. The outer part I was able to cut into squares but I wound up scooping up and throwing the center away. This recipe has good flavor and potential but I won't be the one experimenting with it. Sorry.",

The difference was you melt 1 stick of butter and mix 1/2 cup of sugar with a tablespoon of cinnamon drizzle the melted butter on the top of the pastry and sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar and bake 30-35 mins 350 \nBam!! Amazing  if it is too much sugar for your tastes you can always cut it back!! I also used the whole egg in my filling and no need for egg white on top!",

My husband had made strawberry compote & I mixed that with a quart of fresh strawberries to add on the side. Perfection. My husband & 3 kids say this is definitely one to keep!
