I marinated the breasts overnight, flipping every so often, and then baked them for one hour at 350. I lined the pan with Release foil so everything was a breeze. I didn't have OJ concentrate, so I just used about 1 cup of regular OJ. Also, used lemon juice from the squirty plastic thingy, not fresh. This was a hit! Served with fried rice.
