I came to All Recipes in desperation, found this, and followed it precisely.  The semlor couldn't have come out more perfect.  Tack sa mycket!",

The bun tasted right but was too dense and chewy. The filling was too diluted by the bread. The mandel massa flavor was lost. I added almond extract and sugar to try to restore some of the flavor but it still tasted too much like soggy bread. I will compare this with other semlor recipes and try again with some tweaks.
