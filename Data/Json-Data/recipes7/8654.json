And you could honestly use dried dill weed instead of fresh and be just fine! Fresh dill is kind of awkward to cut and if you leave too big of chunks in your sauce it doesn't have the best feeling in your mouth (kind of scratchy). But I made this for my boyfriend and his sister and they thought I was a magical chef. Definitely try it out! I also added some lemon pepper to the salmon while it cooked and a little to the sauce as well. I think it was a nice touch for the salmon",

I made it according to the directions tasted it and added some garlic salt and pepper. I used dried dill weed by the way and the dill flavor was fine. I got the sauce to taste pretty good but when you add the salmon to the dish it still fell flat. It wasn't bad by any means but it still needed that \"zoom-bang\" factor to it. I will try adding a bit more garlic and some lemon as per other reviews next time possibly. This is not a recipe to toss out rather than to build upon to make great.",

The lemon flavor came through along with the pepper to make the sauce more tangy and flavorful. It was easy to prepare and all parties enjoyed it. I thought using different types of pickle relish rather than cucumbers would be interesting to try. Fresh dill seems to be better than dill weed dried.",
