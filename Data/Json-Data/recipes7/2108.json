However I could only fit 6 slices of bread in the pan they were pretty big slices and I had to squeeze them to fit. That being said I felt there was way too much milk. The bread was really wet after baking. It had really great flavor and the house smelled wonderful while baking. I may try again using less milk and maybe more egg.",

I had to tweak the recipe a little because I only had a demi loaf of day old French bread. I was able to get 8 small 1 inch slices out of the loaf. I was going to halve the recipe but ended up just tweaking it a little. Here are the changes I made: 1/2 c brown sugar 1/4 c light corn syrup 8 slices of french bread 1 3/4 c 2% milk. Everything else I left the same. I baked it in an 8x8 glass baking dish. I mixed together the cinnamon and sugar mixture but ended up only using a little over half because that seems like enough. I baked 50 mins and it came out of the oven perfect! My husband loved it so I will be making this again in the future!",

I didn't have time to let it set over night becuase my kids were hungry now of course! But I really wanted to try this one. I followed the recipe and cooked the brown sugar etc. Instead of pouring the egg mixture over the bread I continued to make regular french toast on the stove. I tol some of the brown sugar mixture and spread it in a skillet dunked the bread into the egg mixture and put it in the skillet and cooked as usual. It still turned out wonderful! I can't wait to plan ahead and make it in the over to see the difference. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
