This is one of my favorite, easy recipes for a light, fluffy lemon drizzle cake. This is also my boyfriend's absolute favorite; he exclaimed it was the best cake he's ever had, which is certainly saying something! Serve with a cup of tea and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. When life give you lemons, make lemon cake!",

After 45 minutes I took it out and it collapsed completely in the middle in the shape of a rectangle so was just left with cake around the perimeter. It was completely raw like the batter. I left it to cool but only the outside was cooked. Please can you suggest where I could have gone wrong because the taste was amazing and would like to make it again. Regards Penny Bird",
