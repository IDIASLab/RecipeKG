This is our favorite cheesecake. Great tasting and with simple directions. I did add a tad more vanilla flavoring. Only because I had the dollar store brand on hand.

It is exactly as explained \"light and airy\" which means it is easier to pound back piece after piece:) Cons: it's a bit of a thin cake though I think when I use larger eggs and really beat them like crazy it has better results. Other things: I have tried different crusts and I prefer ginger snap crust! I have also made this a few times with agave nectar instead of sugar and it tasted the same(if not better). My favorite is to put cherry pie filling on top but not much of the sauce just the actual cherries and it is SO GOOD!",

The second time, I added crushed almond slices to the vanilla wafers on the bottom and sides, included 1 tsp. of almond extract and used a 1/4 cup of Truvia instead of a 1/2 cup of sugar (in fact, it was slightly less than 1/4 cup).  Still yummy.  I have only one concern:  It cracks and \"falls\" a lot after being taken out of the oven.  However, I just re-read the recipe and saw that it was supposed to rest in the oven for an hour after baking.  Is that my problem?  (Please note I also live at a high altitude.  Could this have an impact?)  The \"falling \" is the only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5.",
