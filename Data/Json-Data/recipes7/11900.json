I did use more cashews than called for b/c the amount didn't seem like enough to me once I put it out on the cookie sheet but that was my only change. LOVED the addition of the sea salt both inside and on top. Keep a close eye on the butter/sugar mixture as it cooks (I burned mt first batch lol). Definitely use butter for this no margarine b/c you will get a rich buttery flavor! I can't wait to make this for the holidays...a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I made as directed other than increasing the cashews to a full cup (3/4 cup on the bottom). I used my 4 cup glass measuring bowl for the toffee mixture. After about 4-5 minutes I noticed that the mixture looked like it was going to boil over but just when it got to the top of the bowl it went back down. Made me wonder if that was the reason for buttering the top of the container. Never did boil over even though it looked close several times. It took about 10 - 12 minutes to cook in my microwave. Timing is a bit uncertain because at about 6 minutes my microwave blew a fuse and it took a minute or so to trip it back and start the heating process again. Did not affect the end product which turned out so tasty! I like the addition of the nuts in the toffee base and the flavor is wonderful. Can't wait to share!",
