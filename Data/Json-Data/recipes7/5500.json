This cake is just so rich and moist (although I guess any recipe that uses 6 large eggs and a cup of butter is going to be luxurious!!!). I actually choose this recipe as I needed to use up some cream cheese and loved the fact it was an newly published one. The only thing I will say is to watch the bake time my oven needed less than the hour. Now that I have this wonderful recipe I plan to play around with all combinations of flavors...",

I followed the recipe exactly with the only change being that I halved it and put it into a mini bundt cake pan. I was trying out a couple of recipes for St. Patricks Day. Anyway the problem I had was with the taste and texture of the cake. It was super sweet spongy like and closer to a yellowish colored angel food cake in taste and texture. The cake was almost reminiscent of a twinkie without the filling. I was so expecting a dense and not overly sweet cake from the picture which is what I really wanted. I also lost about 1/4 of the mini bundt cakes due to tearing on the top. Although that was my choice to make mini ones. The cake will rise about 1/2\" above where the battered is poured so plan that when choosing a bundt cake pan size.",
