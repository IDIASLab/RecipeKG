I do wish AR would list broccoli in cups (and a lot of other ingredients especially fruits and vegetables). I buy big bags of broccoli florets at Sam's. Even if I did buy crowns they vary a lot in size and in the amount of florets provided. I don't fault this recipe just wish AR would standardize. I used two cups bite-sized broccoli florets thinking that 2:1 would be a good ratio between broccoli and grapes. I also cut the grapes in half.",
