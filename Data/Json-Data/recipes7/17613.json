Just a tip for getting the flan out of the jars...once you have it flipped over with the plate on top give it a FIRM shake and it will pop right out! I had a little bit of caramel still left in the bottom after flipping it over that I used to drizzle on the white plate over the flan. I added some fresh whipped cream to the top and a few colored sprinkles (since I was making this at the holidays). BAM - yummy and impressed the guests!",
