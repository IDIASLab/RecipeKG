Oh - and does anybody really chop raisins? I think that would take way too much time. I didn't chop mine. In any case with the chocolate chips I would give it 4 stars - without I give it 3. It's tasty and I like to try to eat healthy. I totally appreciate a healthy dessert; this was a great snack and a fun way to get the kids to eat a little bit of fruits/veggies... but I'm not a huge fan of fruit cake and I think the chocolate chips might be mostly to blame for the kids fighting for the last piece. All in all I'm glad I tried this recipe and I'm sure I will be trying it again. Thanks sneaky mommy!:)",

Also two substitutions: (a) buttermilk instead of the unavailable apple juice concentrate and (b) 1 C. date filling (a paste-like product of local date growers quite inexpensive and gives the batter a nice dark color) instead of the raisins and chopped dates. It stayed very moist during baking but the top was firm after 40 min. (with turbo). Sliced into small squares while still warm and rushed to a community potluck; it disappeared quickly proably a hit with preschoolers. A few we stashed at home were fine the next day. Next time I'd add cinnamon which I favor in any chocolate cake.",

I didn't have the apple juice concentrate so used - get this -prune juice instead! As another viewer suggested I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. They were fabulous!!",
