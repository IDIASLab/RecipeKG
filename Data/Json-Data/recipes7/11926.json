The one thing that I didn't care about with this recipe is that the apples are on the dry side.  If you add a little water right at the beginning, this will help.  The recipe says \"diced,\" and I went ahead and diced them, but I simply didn't like them this small (personal preference), and will go back to cutting them into larger chunks in the future...takes a little longer, but not much.  And your cooking time will depend on the power of your microwave plus the size of the apple pieces.",

I had pink lady apples, not Galas, and even with 2 mins cooking they weren't oven soft.  But raw apples hurt my teeth, and I could probably put them in another minute if I want.  I did add a bit of butter to this and used light brown sugar instead.  Yummy!  I may use Truvia next time so this becomes a healthier alternative.  Thanks!",

Sooo tasty!! however, I simplify it even more by simply cutting an Apple into chunks off the core, adding some cinnamon dashed and a pinch of sugar, and a splash of water, then mic them for a minute 30. I don't know if they are as soft as this recipe's, but they are good enough for me. Serve with vanilla ice cream to make it really desserty, or peel them and bake them in a pie crust! Or to make a really easy Apple pie feel, add some granola for immediate crunch!!",
