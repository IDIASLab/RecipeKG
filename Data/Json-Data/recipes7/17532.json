Dough was nicely firm not runny and there was a nice amount of chips and nuts scattered through bread. Try 50 minutes and see if it needs more -- mine was very brown at 60 min and slightly dry - next time I'll go for the shorter time first. Might add cinnamon or cardamon next time though... Only made two changes - Didn't have Oat flour - subbed whole wheat flour Used a 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown since we prefer a less sweet bread and my bananas were very ripe! Ended up with a nice swish of banana flavor and a hint of sweetness just like we like it.",

I will try with different aged bananas and readjust my review if the bread is any different. In all it is good bread and you should at least try it once.",
