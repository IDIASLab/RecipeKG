I enjoy it all summer-and I always have the best naps after eating it. You can make the yogurt mixture ahead and keep it in the fridge and just dish out a bowl whenever you like. Though optional, the rose petals make it pretty and quintessentially Persian. You can usually find food-safe dried rose petals in Middle Eastern supermarkets.",

I saw your article in the recent AR magazine and I've been positively itching to make this ever since. I added a pinch of cardamom just for extra depth since I didn't have the rose petals this time. I made a quick flatbread dough of greek yogurt flour and rosemary that i cooked in a cast iron skillet while the soup was chilling. The recipe was more than enough for my husband and I to have generous portions for lunch and I packed the leftovers for my lunch at work. It's simply delicious and satisfying - thank you for sharing!",
