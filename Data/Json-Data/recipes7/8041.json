This usually involves a bit more fiber and protein and less sugar. I used pineapple juice instead of orange because that's what I had and a cup of whole wheat for one of the white flours. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar to lighten the sweetness and also added a few table spoons of wheat germ and 2/3 cup of whole oats into the flour mixture. I added a cup of chopped pecans with only 2/3 cup of craisins and 1/3 cup minced white chocolate bar. I always set the timer for less time than advised so I can check it with a toothpick and not overcook. I recommend the cupcake papers for regular muffins and cooking spray for minies because it's a little stickier. I may try it again with even less sugar but it was deicious!",

Was out of craisins so I used a mix of regular raisins and golden raisins. Also only had one cup of OJ so melted a fruit popsicle and added enough water to equal 1 cup. Could not tell in the final result. Added one teaspoon of cinnamon in addition to the allspice and it was barely enough spice for such a large recipe. It made 19 regular size muffins and 48 mini-muffins. 4 boys and one husband ate them right up!",

I only had an 11 oz. bottle of orange juice and used water for the other 5 oz. If it had the full two cups I cannot even imagine. I substituted 1/2 c cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 c of oil. Based on other reviews I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the 1 tsp of allspice. I didn't have a full cup of dried cranberries so I added fresh cranberries halved to fill the cup. I really wanted to use just fresh but I wasn't sure how that would affect the outcome. Once everything was blended in I tasted the batter again. I added a lot of pumpkin pie spice not even sure how much but at least a tablespoon I would estimate. Still the orange was overpowering the pumpkin. I did like the spice level better. The only other change I made was to add some walnut pieces on top of the brown sugar. The total production was 24 standard muffins 3 large muffins and 6 giant muffins. My brother is taking these to work tomorrow. I will update with the reactions from there.",
