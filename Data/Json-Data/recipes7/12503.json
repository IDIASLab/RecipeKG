Not that I'm incapable of  eating an entire two layer fudge bomb, but I was afraid I'd get caught in the act and would have to live with the shame. \nThis was just what I was looking for...fudgy goodness in a sane quantity.\n I made it in a smallish bowl instead of a mug and was glad I did. If you have a large  jumbo mug it should work, but it would have spilled over any of my regular ones. I added a bit of cinnamon and a handful of chocolate chips, microwaving it for about 2 minutes and 15 seconds, opening the door and checking a few times during the last 45 seconds or so. Even with all that checking it still turned out perfectly!",

My advice is cut the sugar way down to 2 tablespoons  or even 1 tablespoon. 2 tablespoons will have you at 90 calories and 24 grams of sugar. I suggest doing 1 tablespoon and removing the oil with applesauce. It takes good, is still moist but so much healthier. My changes are 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons applesauce, 3 tablespoons Blue Diamond Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk makes it only 202 calories and only 12 grams of sugar.",

I followed everything except the time on the microwave. Since I added a big spoon of Nutella in the middle and semi sweet chocolate chips I put it for 2 min and 20 sec and it came out perfect. I listened to other reviewers and did mine in a soup mug and it was perfect. I can see why it would go over in a regular mug.   Trust me make this cake! It will make your day.
