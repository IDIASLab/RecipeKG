Because the consistency reminded me of traditional bisquits and gravy I added 1 tsp maybe a little more of poultry seasoning(to give it the sausage flavor) and a little cayenne pepper. It was delicious. I was reluctant to add the maple syrup at first but it added such a nice flavor. Thanks for the new addition to my recipe box and another way to cook the deer in the freezer.",

The gravy was smooth and creamy with a slightly sweet taste that complimented the deer perfectly. Everyone in the house loved it both kids and adults! The biscuits could use a little work. I added about 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe after mixing it up and seeing how runny the biscuit dough was. This helped me to form biscuits. They cooked up well but they were crispy and crunchy on the outside making them hard to cut on the plate. I will continue using this gravy recipe for our weekend breakfasts but will go back to using the biscuit recipe in my better homes and gardens cookbook.",
