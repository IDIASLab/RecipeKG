I honestly planned to add the sugar but when push came to shove I couldn't do it. Instead I sweetened greens the way I always have: caramelized onions. I diced one large onion and cooked it in olive oil (I didn't have vegetable oil but olives are veggies right?). Anyway I sauteed them over low heat for 25 minutes... until the onions turned lightly brown. Caramelized onions will sweeten anything with a depth that can make you swoon. So okay... I couldn't bring myself to resort to sugar. My tried and true worked just fine. The end result was tasty indeed. I washed and rinsed the greens in broth as directed but I'm not sure the broth made any difference. I didn't add 2 c. of broth to the pot because covered greens will steam using the pot's heat making for denser vitamins and minerals. And the cooking time is a little less without added water or brother (closer to 40 minutes than an hour. I added the garlic toward the end of the cooking to avoid burning it. The bacon bits were a nice addition to my usual recipe (I normally add a small amount of red pepper flakes) so that made for a nice change. I can give it a recommendation to try it (ideally with caramelized onions): mixed greens are so very good for you!",

Cooking time itself was about the same as recipe. I didn't really pay it that much attention. Oh added salt to taste but no pepper (my palate is weird and doesn't react well to pepper). My husband gives it two thumbs up and I ate all but the portion my husband had. It was even good cold the next day! Thank you!",
