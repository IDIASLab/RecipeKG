Who would have thought that putting chopped rhubarb wrapped up in a canned bisquit dough with a buttery sugar syrup could turn out SOOO good. I followed the recipe as it was printed and it was great. I made a second batch to give to neighbors and basted the bisquits a couple of times during the bake time. both batches were exceptionally good. This will replace my pie recipes.And the bonus is no oven to clean from pie juice run over.",

I cut down on the sugar (used about 3/4 cup) and it was a great blend of sweet and tart. I do agree with another post that basting them about halfway through makes a huge difference--they came out with a caramelized sugary crusty wonderful top. We had to really work hard at not eating more than one for dessert. But of course we ate one for breakfast instead! Going to try with a number of other fruity delicious fillings. But the rhubarb is really amazing. (ps...don't be afraid to really fill these up--we went light on the rhubarb thinking they were really full already but we totally could have used the full 2 cups). Awesome!",
