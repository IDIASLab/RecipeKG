I added a little vanilla and cinnamon and the flavor was palatable. We smothered them in homemade strawberry syrup (thank you Chef John!). I was disappointed because I am trying spelt flour out on my family and was looking for some good recipes. This was not one of them. I'll try a different recipe next time.",
