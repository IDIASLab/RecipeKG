This way, they transfer really easily to the cookie sheets.  Thanks, Hanner!",

The only modification I made was that I used only vanilla extract instead of the rum and almond. Also I didn't have a \"pastry cutter\" so I used a cheese grater instead and it worked perfectly! I just made simple round cookies but they would've been the perfect cookie-cutter cookie because it completely held it's shape.",

I made the recipe exactly as written except that I used a food processor to cut in the butter. The flavor is an authentic soft buttery slightly floury shortbread one so if that's your reason for trying this it's a good recipe. I was disappointed that my cookie dough was very sticky and impossible to work with even after ample time in the fridge. The results were sporadic as far as keeping their shapes with many of them spreading too much. I was careful not to re-use warm cookie sheets I used parchment paper and chilled dough so I don't know what went wrong.",
