Both times I used apple pie filling (a 32 ounce jar) instead of bothering to peel, chop, and cook apples to basically make a pie filling. With all the other shortcuts, why make your own pie filling (unless you have apples you need to get rid of)? \n\nI personally don't think the cinnamon grahams add much and the 2nd time making it I just used regular grahams (maybe because my store bought pie filling had plently of cinnamon in it).\n\nEasy & quick to make (with the store bought filling). Yummy. Makes a 13\" x 9\" dish very very full though.",
