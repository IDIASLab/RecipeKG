This is a great cookie for all the chewy CC cookie lovers, I think that's the effect of the additional flour - a chewier cookie. The dough is VERY stiff to work with, my KA didn't like it much. Very tasty cookies, and I'll probably make them again!",

I would have given them a five if the title wasn't so ... final.  I do recommend only putting eight cookies on a sheet, when you flatten them they get much bigger then you might expect.  so to avoid an unfortunate mess just put less cookies on the sheet.   *edit*   I have made these cookies MANY times now.  I think this is officially \"my\" chocolate chip recipe.  I usually use 1/2C margarine and 1/2C shortening, it saves on using up all my butter at one time.  I also don't usually put in all the vanilla it calls for (depending on who I'm cooking them for, my mom hates cookies with a lot of vanilla flavor)  If your using vanilla extract use the full amount, but if your using REAL vanilla, you can half the amount and they still turn out wonderful.   I've also noticed that sometimes I don't always use the last 1/2 C of flour, I add the flour 1/2 a cup at a time and sometimes 3 1/2 cups is too much.  ",

This is no exception, but it is not exception-AL compared to other great recipes. While it may not hold the distinction of being \"the best,\" it nevertheless holds its own with the best of them. Looking over the reviews I noticed these described many ways - cakey, crumbly, chewy, crunchy and more - all are correct. Experienced bakers will know that how cookies turn out, even with the same recipe, will depend on a number of variables such as size, thickness and how long they're baked.  In my case, I prepared the dough as written, but couldn't bring myself to bake them at 300 degrees. I baked them at 350 and they were delightfully crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle, just how I like them. After scooping the cookies onto the sheet I flattened them only slightly and they turned out pleasantly thick and substantial. All and all, I was very pleased with this recipe - and hubs and I were both very pleased with the resulting cookie. ",

Just like another reviewer said, they're like Subway cookies. I like my cookies chewy, and the crispy outer edge is enough so that it doesn't fall apart and doesn't appear underbaked. It is a large cookie - about 1/4 cup dough for each. \n\nNotes:\nThe recipe didn't say if brown sugar was to be tightly packed or lightly packed; I made mine tightly packed. I didn't grease the baking sheet since the recipe didn't call for it, not a problem at all... it actually came out a bit greasy. I left the cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes after taking them out of the oven (15 mins baking time), then put them on paper towels to absorb some of the grease. \n\nI can understand how the title can put some people off. It uses a lot of ingredients and I was a bit afraid to make the full recipe but went for it anyway. I'm more than happy I did!!! SINFULLY YUMMY! ",

Maybe the white sugar is not supposed to be there, but I added it with the brown sugar. Maybe that's why mine came out dry and hard.\n\nAlso, when baking at 300 degrees, there was no way these cookies were done in 17 minutes. I kept going until the edges were golden, and the result was that they were just hard lumps. I upped the oven temp and the second batch seemed a little better. \n\nI don't have any incentive to try again, but my recommendation to anyone attempting this recipe is to boost the oven temp to 325 and make sure you flatten the dough balls quite thin.\n\n",

Be prepared for stiff dough but I still managed even with a hand held mixer. A bag of chocolate chips is approx. 2 cups and I made mine heaping. The cooling time on the sheets is important since it lets the middle of the cookie finish baking through. My kids couldn't believe I gave them a cookie THAT big. The only down side to these is that the dough being stiffer isn't so tasty uncooked. More for the oven then.",
