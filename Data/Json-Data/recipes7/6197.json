This is a nice and moist banana bread that sliced nicely.  I froze a couple of loaves for my son and they thawed nice without getting that wet feeling to the outside of the bread.  I made 3 small loaves (3 1/2 x 6) two without the nuts for my son and 1 with nuts.  Thanks ccole6 for sharing your recipe.",
