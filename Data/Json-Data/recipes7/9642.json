First time for a dish like this- I used store bought pie crusts for ease baking the bottom crust first. I only used a half of a small head of cabbage- only wrong move- should have used it all- it bakes down! And I added about a cup of shredded medium cheddar under the processed cheese slices. Every bite was devoured! Will definitely make this again!",

I also have made it using bagged coleslaw mix (pre-shredded cabbage) using one 14 oz bag per recipe instead of the cabbage--handy if you want to spend less time or don't have a food processor. I have also used this recipe to make individual Runzas and they turned out great. For individual Runzas I doubled the filling recipe and tripled the dough recipe to make approx. 18 Runzas. I baked the individual Runzas on parchment paper on a cookie sheet for 15-17 min. Thanks for the great recipe!",
