I creamed the butter and sugar together added the egg and vanilla extract and beat til smooth. I did not sift the dry ingredients. I alternated the buttermilk with the dry ingredients. Sprayed baking Pam into the muffin pans. I filled each 2/3 full and topped with Jan's Crumb Topping or Streusel. Baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. They came out moist and very tastey!",

Please know that the dough is VERY stiff and if I had not added about another 1/4 cup of buttermilk the blueberries I added would have been destroyed if they had not been frozen. These muffins have a delightful flavor. DH took 3 to work for AM coffee break and just called to tell me to save this recipe. Done! I'm making some to go in DD's freezer and using the suggested chopped apples and cinnamon. BIG hit! BIG thank you!!!",
