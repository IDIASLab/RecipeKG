Since I do like a little spice I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a generous tsp. of vanilla. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin and got 8 huge muffins. I topped them with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven for a little added crunch. I baked them at 400 for 22 minutes. They smelled wonderful and tasted even better. This recipe is a great base for add-in's such as chocolate chips or nuts. Thanks \"Easter Bunny\" for a great recipe!",
