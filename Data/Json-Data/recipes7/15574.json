The texture is different than any quick bread I ve ever made and that s not intended as negative just different. However it is very moist not dense but not totally light either (hope that makes sense) sweet but somewhat neutral in flavor. I was looking for something that would be a bit different from a buttery pound cake flavor to spoon some fresh fruit or a fruit sauce over and I think this will work well...I'll know tonight! ASweeney thanks for a tasty new recipe. UPDATE 4.11.18 As I mentioned yesterday the texture of this bread is just a bit different so I wondered how it would toast. Well it was delicious this morning as a thick slice of toast spread with plum preserves. Liking this versatile bread more and more.",

It was very easy to make, very easy to stir. The batter was very liquidy. It filled a bread pan to the top.  (I measured the yogurt, but I think I may have been a little generous. I also used large eggs.)  I ended up using a ladle to take some out and fill two mini loaf pans. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the turnout!  Next time I think I will see if the recipe works just as well with whey instead of yogurt.",
