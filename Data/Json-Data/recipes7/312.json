Seccond chili paste is -very- concentrated. You will not get close to the same flavor using chili sauce or anything else. A good thai chili paste is worth having in your refrigerator if you enjoy spicy asain cuisine because it is made of authentic ingredients like palm sugar and tamarind and lemon grass- things that we can't find easily most places here in the US. Now for the recipe- it didn't do anything for me or my husband. I did add lime juice after cooking and that helped. Wasn't bad wasn't amazing. It just was.",

I also added three tablespoons fresh chopped ginger and 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. I doubled the sauce and used only one diced chicken broth. Definitely double the sauce because with all the veggies its great to have a nice coating. I didn't have chili paste and used garlic chili sauce instead. As a side note I prefer sauteeing the chicken first until its done then adding the onion and broccoli and letting it simmer for five minutes. Then add the remaining veggies for another 5-10 min or until done - a least then your peppers and mushrooms aren't mushy.",

Ths sauce is dark soy plus \"nam prik pao\" chili paste maybe some cornstarch and water to thicken chicken broth if u like...Toast or fry the cashews before adding them in stir in some green onion sprinkle with some coriander too if you like. FYI - Thais usually dont throw veggies in the dish but serve a separate veggie dish... but hey whatever you like:-)",

To add additional color and variety I used a red orange and yellow bell peppers. I added 1-1/2 tablespoons of peanut butter and 1 tablespoon of lime juice. I used bonless chicken thighs instead of breast..because it's moister. Next time I make this recipe I will do one thing differently...I won't put raw chicken into the skillet on top of my vegtables. I did not like that at all and it was a guessing game to make sure it was done good enough for serving. I will pre cook my chicken and set it aside before I start the vegis. Other than that I will leave the recipe as it is. My family really enjoyed this and we will make it again for sure!",
