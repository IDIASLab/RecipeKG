I added 1/2 tsp of oil and swapped to olive oil (omega 9 - much healthier) because I freeze sometimes and lower oil gets dry.  I also used half the sugar and used brown as there are a few more nutrients there and subbed out the rest with a tsp of stevia extract.  Finally I added 1/4 cup pecans and 1/4 cup chocolate chips into the bread and on top of the loaf I sprinkled 2 tablespoons white sugar (only use of it) and sprinkled a few chocolate chips (not many) for appearance sake mostly.    It turned out wonderfully and will present in a way that my church people (that are not healthy eaters) will like it.  (I've discovered if you want them to eat healthy, put all the sugar on the outside!).  The only thing I will do differently next time is add maybe a little more banana (I used frozen and it was in chunks so I don't think I got the full \"three\" it called for) and possibly a tablespoon of applesauce to keep it moist but it was so good that my daughter kept saying, \"Are you sure it's healthy?\".  I may also lose the nutmeg next time but I'm thrilled with the antioxident power of this bread...all that dark chocolate with little fat and sugar - wow!  Thanks for this recipe and I'm so glad you posted it.  No one will know this is a healthy bread.",

(to make it more moist,) added 1/2 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/4 C. of applesauce, and omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg (I felt like two flavors were already plenty.) I quadrupled the recipe and made fifteen mini loaves for gifts. I had my kids try one and they loved it. It was moist, delicious, and not overly sweet, with the added benefit of whole wheat. I bake A LOT, and I'll definitely make this one again! (Note: the above changes I included are for the original, one-loaf recipe.)",

The whole wheat flour works very well in this recipe.  It just seemed that the chocolate and banana were competing with each other instead of complimenting each other.  I think I would prefer to make regular banana bread and add chocolate chunks to it, rather than adding cocoa powder.",

EDITED REVIEW: I made these again last night and cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups and found even cutting back the flour there wasn't near enough liquid for the muffins. Maybe because my bananas were smaller? I added 1/4 cup greek yogurt and it came out perfectly. Very moist. I got 12 muffins out of one recipe and only four remain this morning!",
