I used a combo of natural Peanut butter and cashew butter to use up some of these that have been in my fridge for awhile and they turned out great--not as sweet as normal Peanut butter cookies but I liked that about them. I also used some of the batter to make the little witches ' hats using dark chocolate kisses and those turned out really good too. This is now my go-to Peanut butter cookie recipe.
