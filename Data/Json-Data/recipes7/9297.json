I've made heavy boozy delicious sangrias appropriate for summertime weekend PAR-TAYS!!!! and I've made light boozy delicious peachy sangrias appropriate for a girls night in of party-planning and now I have this 3rd option in my back pocket;) This stuff is perfect for a lunch date with the girls when you still have to be able to drive home and get dinner on the table for your crew. It's light refreshing and won't get anyone smashed! Exactly like what you get from the restaurant chains on their 2-fer-1s! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! (UPDATE: I asked a friend to bring the OJ and she brought blueberry juice instead-guess what! still delish different but sooooo good and SO SO SO PRETTY!!! just can't go wrong)",
