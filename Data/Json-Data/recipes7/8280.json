Like everyone else when I had mixed everything together it was very crumbly and not very dough-like for cookies. So I added two eggs and brought the dough together quite nicely. For the people that didn't like the taste -- these are meant to be subtly sweet and to be eaten with tea not by themselves. My family really enjoyed them (hubby and ten month old daughter). I will most likely be making these again just adding the two eggs automatically after creaming the butter and sugar.",
