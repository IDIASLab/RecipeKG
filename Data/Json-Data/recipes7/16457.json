To make chocolate leaves to decorate your cake, melt 1 ounce semisweet chocolate in a pan or bowl set over boiling water, stir until smooth. Brush real nontoxic plant leaves (such as orange leaves) on 1 side with melted chocolate. Freeze until firm and then peel off the chocolate leaves. Freeze until needed.",
