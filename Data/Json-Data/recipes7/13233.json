        "description": "This is my first creation on this site and I couldn't think of a better recipe to share with everyone. First off, I'm a 22-year-old man and when I was in my teens, my great-grandmother, who I called Muz, would make sugar cookies all the time for me and my grandparents. They were phenomenal, as she had perfected it over the years. She passed at the young age of 95 in 2006 and left the recipe in one of her boxes. Now that I've been cooking, I found her recipe for her Drop Sugar Cookies last week and made them last night. They are awesome, but you'll learn that when you make them. Enjoy!",

Shortening is kinda gross these days but important for soft crunch, all butter will create harder crunch if baked longer & will darken and soft cookie if baked on time.   I drizzled cream cheese frosting w orange juice, rind & almond extract dang!  I will make these my Christmas cookie this year, thank you Grandma!!!!!!",

I made a couple adjustments, based on necessity and other reviewers comments. I didn't have shortening, so I substituted margarine (I often use half butter/half margarine in cookie recipes; makes them softer).  I also increased vanilla to 1 and 3/4 tsp, just because I always increase the vanilla, based on the size of the recipe (I've been known to go as high as a TBL!). And, finally, the temperature ~ I set the oven at 325, and baked the cookies for 20 minutes.  It makes for a softer cookie, and over time, it's become a habit.  I used half and half, 3 TBL, because I was out of milk. I may try sour cream or yogurt next time I make them, just to see what happens, since my GF's formerly favorite sugar cookies were made with sour cream. I rolled them into a roughly walnut-size and -shape, dipped a glass in a little water, then sugar, then pressed just until they were flat. Again, just delicious!",
