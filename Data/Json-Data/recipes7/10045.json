Anyway I think they're pretty good but they aren't perfect. They were done at 30 minutes and they make a lovely presentation. The cheesecake-style topping is also delicious and I love the suggestion to reserve a bit of the red velvet batter to make swirling a little bit easier and more successful. However I think the red velvet layer could use a bit of work...the texture came out a bit \"gummy\" to me and I think it could use a little more flavor as well. Otherwise it's a pretty good recipe...thanks!",
