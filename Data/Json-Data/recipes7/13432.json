It was super-easy to make and smelled amazing while baking. After looking at a few other recipes I decided to line my baking pan with parchment and grease it. That meant it was really easy to lift the bars out of the pan. I cut them after cooling for about 15 minutes. They're still nice and chewy today too. A bit heavy on the molasses so I will cut that down further next time I make them. Stored them in a Tupperware and wrapped some up to freeze too. Thanks for the recipe; I can't wait to try it with different fruit/nut combinations!",

Thought as I read it that it was a lot of sweetness and it is. Made the mistake of halving the recipe to try it and putting it in a slightly smaller than 13 x 9 pan to fit in my toaster oven- took almost double time to cook and still a bit wiggly in center. I will tweak the sugars liquids and flours to make more healthy and nutrient packed and report back!",
