The directions say after adding the eggs to heat until thick for 10 minutes stirring constantly. Let me just say that after twice doing that, it doesn't take 10 minutes. Actually 5 minutes or less. Believe me, if you go the full 10 minutes you will get scrambled eggs every time. So 15 eggs later I finally got yummy ice cream.",

Just an FYI hickory nut are so good very mild in flavor and similar to pecans in taste. The next time I make this I will omit the nuts all together!! You see I'm French Canadian and I'm just a mapleholic! I don't need nuts in my ice cream just the pure maple taste is really all I want. I will just add the maple syrup that is used for the wet nut part w/o nuts! I'm sure it will taste great and I'm going to double up the batch! No wonder I go through 5 gallons a yr!:)",
