It is wonderful along side of the Sweet and Sour Pork Patties recipe.  I served the Sweet and Sour Pork Patties, Danish Christmas Red Cabbage and mashed potatoes for a after Christmas dinner.  It was a huge hit. Also,  this recipe cans very easily.  I pack mine hot into clean pint jars leaving about 1/4 inch head space (make sure to put in lots of liquid, too) I process them in a hot water bath for about 12 mins.  Remove jars and let them sit until you hear the lids pop.  Last over a year this way.",

I was surprised by the amt of sugar called for, so I substituted Equal's Sugar Lite for 1/2 c. and then 1 1/2 c. sugar. That seemed to be fine. I also ran out of white vinegar & ended up using red wine vinegar for 1 1/2 cups of the vinegar called for. That worked great too! I diced up one apple and added that while cooking.
