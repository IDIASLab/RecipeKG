I made this tonight to go with a simple green salad and I am officially declaring it my favorite dressing. It is a little on the sweet side but I didn't mind it and you could always decrease the sugar to taste. I expected the onion flavor to be overpowering but it wasn't. It had a mild onion flavor with a hint of sweetness. None of the ingredients overpowered another one but instead made the perfect blend of flavors. This is definitely going to be one of my go to dressings. I see a lot of salads in my future!",
