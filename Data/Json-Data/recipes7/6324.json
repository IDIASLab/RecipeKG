It was simple and tasted great.  I used chicken breast tenders, so the oven cook time was about 30 mins.  The only thing different I would do; is after I put the chicken in the oven, I would make another bowl of sauce.  It would have been nice to have extra and some to add on the fried rice that I made.  This is a keeper!!",

I doubled the amount of sweet and sour sauce and thickened the extra with cornstarch in a sauce pan on the stove. While the chicken was cooking, I made a pot of brown rice, mixed it with steamed vegetables, then served the chicken on top of the rice and veggies. Those who chose to, drizzled the extra sweet and sour sauce over all. What a great meal! Next time, I may decrease the amount of vinegar to reduce the acid in the sauce. Definitely keeping this recipe handy.",
