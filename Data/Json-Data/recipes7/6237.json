I doubled the vanilla and to give it a little spice I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I also subbed 1 Tbsp. of buttermilk vs. milk. You could do half brown sugar and half white sugar depending on what you have in your kitchen. And, this is great with or without the nuts and chocolate chips! I topped this with a little turbinado sugar before popping it in the oven for a little extra added crunch on top. I baked it at 350 for a little over an hour and just as Chef John states, it's \"scrumptious\"!",

I also think the 1/2 cup of butter and extra sugar is what made this bread so good. The only change I made was I used sour cream instead of milk and next time I will reduce the salt to half. I divided it into two loaves using (Demarle loaf pans) and baked at 350 for only 40 minutes. This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever made!
