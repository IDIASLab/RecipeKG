I had to substitute salad greens for spinach because I happened to make it during the spinach scare but it was still excellent... I plan on making it again soon. It does make too much dressing though so next time I'll scale it down. You can use the recipe conversion on this site to scale down the number of servings from 8 to 6 and use that for the dressing but keep the other ingredients the same. Thats what I plan on doing.",
