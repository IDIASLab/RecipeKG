I think next time I make this I'll make my own custard as opposed to using custard powder. I did reduce the oil and egg dip quantity as I don't like wasting ingredients. I was scared the bread would be too greasy but to my surprise it didn't have a heavy feel. Great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "These make very pretty little snacks.  Don't expect to eat them as finger food, a fork is required.  I used 'Bird's Custard powder, a British staple.  I mix the custard powder & sugar with a little of the milk in a sauce pan, heat the remainder of the milk in the microwave for about 1 1/2 minutes, then pour the hot milk into the sauce pan and heat until just simmering and thick.  You do need to let it cool a bit before assembling, the custard thickens up even more as it cools.   The only downside I can see for these is that the french toast tastes best warm,  so they really can't be made in advance.  BTW,  you don't need as much oil as called for to make the french toast.   Thanks for a pretty tasty recipe.",
