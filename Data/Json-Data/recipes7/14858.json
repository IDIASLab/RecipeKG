I also feel that inverting this cake is a very necessary step so you have the cheesecake-like texture and have the crunch on the bottom. It's also much easier to eat that way. I add a small amount of vanilla flavoring and a pinch of salt as well since I like the depth of flavor they add but the recipe is great as written, I have made it both ways. Thanks so much!",
