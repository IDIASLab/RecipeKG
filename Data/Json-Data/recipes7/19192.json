Second in order to avoid the runny/glaze type of frosting the first reviewer noted I decided to do a whole 8 oz brick of cream cheese (and I did NOT skip the Guinness in the frosting). The result was a great creamy frosting not a runny glaze like the first reviewer experienced. I would also advise to use real butter and not margerine since that could also make it runnier.",

It was so thin it was more like a glaze. I was worried that adding in the beer straight would thin it out too much and I was right. And also the instruction tell you to just sort of mix everything together for the frosting. That's not a good idea. The butter and cream cheese need to be fully combined before adding anything else or it will end up lumpy. I was really excited about a frosting that actually had Guinness in it but this one didn't work for me. You can't really taste the Guinness either. Maybe boiling the Guinness down a bit before adding into the frosting would help? Either way the cupcakes were great! I forgot to add the milk and I really don't think it's necessary. They were great without it! I also got 36 cupcakes out of this. Overall the party-goers loved the flavor of these! Thank you!",
