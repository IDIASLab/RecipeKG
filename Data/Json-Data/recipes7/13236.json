If you aren't planning to share them, you may want to half the recipe as we got over 48 cookies. Flattening them with your hand yields the best results. They come out crunchy when thin but so chewy good if a bit thicker. Overall, this recipe is a winner. My family loved the coconut flavor and it's simple enough that my 9 year old did most of the work. Enjoy!",

It was a nice bit of added color.\n\nI think when she made it she used margarine, as they'd always spread out in the oven.  I do remember them not spreading one time when I used really cold butter.  I've been softening my butter before baking lately.  I made these last night and didn't have to flatten them.  I think how much they spread depends on how warm/cold your butter is.",
