For those afraid of sour milk, it is simply a substitute for buttermilk.  I use soured milk in every recipe that I have that calls for buttermilk and it works like a charm.  It does NOT make things taste sour!  Another note: the pancakes will start to \"foam up\" after you stir them.  Resist the urge to stir them again.  All those bubbles is what makes them so fluffy.  The batter will be very thick and difficult to pour at this point.  Also, as others have said, this does not serve 8.  In my house, it serves 4 of us.  Enjoy.",

We ate every last bit. I served this with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup. EDITED: I use this pancake recipe frequently because it's incredibly easy. Now I make this lactose-free by using lactose-free milk and either melted margerine or vegetable oil in place of the butter. I like to use whole wheat flour off and on but when I do, I always increase the milk by a quarter cup because whole wheat flour tends to soak up the liquids a little more than AP flour. This doubles and triples well as well as freezes/rewarms well. Sometimes, I'll triple the recipe and freeze the leftovers and on busy days, I pop them into the toaster to reheat. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.",

But, if you don't have it on hand the milk/vinegar method is good in a pinch. I added a tsp. of vanilla for good measure, added the wet ingredients to the dry ones and didn't overmix these. Having a few lumps in the batter is a good thing! I let it rest for a few minutes while the frying pan heated up and WOW - they really puffed up nicely! These were perfect topped with butter and REAL maple syrup.",

If this is 8 servings, it is one little pancake for 8 people. Double or triple the recipe for your family. They puffed up while cooking but were not heavy at all but nice and light. Do not overmix these and let them sit for a 1/2 hour after mixing before frying. The batter thickens and is nice. UPDATE: This is still our favorite pancake recipe but tried making these the night before, putting them in the refrigerator and making in the morning. Works great and convenient, especially when you have a busy morning schedule.  It deserves 5 with doubling the recipe. Just change the serving size to 16 and it is better for  4-6 servings.",

He seperated the two eggs (double recipe) and whipped the egg whites untill they were stiff.  He followed the recipe, incorporating the egg yolks into the mixture, adding the egg whites last, gently folding them in.
