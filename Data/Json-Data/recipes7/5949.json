I would increase the cooking time at least an additional 15 minutes at 300 before kicking it up to 375. Also the amount of bread made more than two layers (actually made four layers which may account for the needed time to cook). Very sweet. I would decrease the sugar by half. I would also sprinkle additional granola between the layers. Will try again.",

I omitted the OJ and the granola as these were ingredients I just didn't think went with it. I followed the rest of the recipe as is but reserved the melted butter and brown sugar until just before it went in the oven. I make fork holes all around the saturated bread then poured the butter/brown sugar mixture over it. I also gave it another drizzle of maple syrup over the top. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes and it came out delicious! Thanks for sharing!",

However it had an amazing flavor and I think it could be a 5 star with some modifications. Problems that I had were that the pound of egg bread I used only had twelve very small pieces in it when cut to required thickness which seems accurate to the serving amount but I felt like the 9x13 pan needed four more pieces. If the pan had been full maybe the bottom wouldn't have been as soggy as it was. Since I changed the cook time/temp I cant complain much but the top was very brown. Next time I will try the temp/time recommended I was just trying to find a short cut and not have to bother with changing the temp. The only way I see around this is to cover for 45 and uncover for 15 but if i have to do this then I could just cook as directed and maybe it'll come out right... I will keep you posted if I try recipe again.",
