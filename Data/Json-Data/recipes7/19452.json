The only thing I did different was sliced the dough into 4 loaves and baked 2 loaves at a time at the recommended temperature as if I was cooking the one loaf, it all turned out perfectly!! It is only my wife and myself here and we devoured 3 loaves in one day! The other loaf was given to my cousin and his wife and his wife did not get any, he consumed the whole loaf in 2 hours!! How much of a compliment is that to NWmama!!!\nGreat job mama!",
