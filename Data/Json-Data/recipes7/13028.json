I was intrigued by the \"French-Greek\" title of this dressing, but it wasn't tangy enough for me, and the lemon flavor dominated a bit too much.  I'm sure there are many folks who would love the milder flavor of this salad dressing, and I don't want to discourage others from trying this.  It's just not my personal taste preference, so please don't take this as a negative.",

So I used a 1/4 tsp. of mustard powder as Dijon has white wine vinegar in it anyways! I thought this was lovely over a garden salad light and lemony. I did not find it acidic at all I wonder if that's because I used regular olive oil(not extra-virgin)or the powdered mustard? Or perhaps my white wine vinegar is more mild than others. I also let this sit in the fridge for a couple hours before we ate maybe that mellowed it out a bit. In any event I wouldn't change a thing love it!!",
