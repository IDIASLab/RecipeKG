I just added the 2 cups to the batter in the frozen state. I baked them in four (6 x 3 1/2) small loaf pans rather than one big pan.  This loaf is moist and packed with flavor.  I found that this is a very good loaf to freeze and it thaws nicely.  I will be making this one again.",

The way the ingredients are combined per direction s is a bit different from the average quick bread, but I followed directions with no problems. I did lightly dice my mandarin oranges. Note that I used my largest loaf pan and there was too much batter for it. It was right to top and was fearful it would poof and go all over my oven. So I ladeled out some and put in a prepared small loaf pan. My cooking time for both was longer than stated, so just keep an eye on it. Tastes amazing!",

'Never used orange extract before & trying to get fruit in the children I went for it.:) 1 3/4c sugar seemed like a lot of sugar - more like the amount for a cake or two loaves. Yes I admit it I reduced it to one cup. I stopped myself from other changes except for oven temperature. Oh I didn't do the fruit & sugar topping thing. Oh & I only had a cup & a half cranberries. Hey it's all I had that were useable!:D Oh yikes:D I changed the directions: Creamed the butter & sugar added the eggs. Combined the milk & sour cream (which I think could be subbed for buttermilk it would seem). Added the extracts to the milk mixture then added that to the combined dry ingredients. Folded in the berries & oranges. 9x5 loaf pan 350 the whole time an hour ten. Sum up: Not as good as my regular cranberry loaf by carol. This one is a little dense & moist enough. A cup of sugar was fine. If I were to play with it I'd probably increase liquid/fat & add another egg or baking soda/powder. It makes a big loaf. There aren't really enough oranges or cranberries (yes I had half cup less). 'Should't be as fruity as fritcake but more could be used for sure - at least in my opinion.",
