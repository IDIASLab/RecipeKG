I didn't use the liquor (kids) or the marmalade.. I just basically made the recipe that's on the wafer box. It looked great and tasted so decadent. I'll be making it again this year. Thanks for the idea! Edited to add: when I make whipped cream I usually add a little instant pudding mix. Partly because it adds flavor and sweetness but mostly because the gelatin stabilizes the whipped cream.",

Even the kids loved it which surprised me because I wasn't sure if they'd like the dark chocolate flavors for the cocoa or the orange marmalade. I couldn't find chocolate wagers anywhere! I checked three different major grocery stores. I substituted with Nilla vanilla wafers and it worked out great! I also loved how everyone thought that I put so much time and effort into forming the \"cake\" into a log. None of them had to know that they were actually eating Nilla wafer cookies and it only took about 30 minutes of prep time =) Will definitely make again next year. Absolutely delicious!",
