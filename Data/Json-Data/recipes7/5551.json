This was my first year attempting Easter bread, and I chose this recipe because it sounded the most like what I was looking for, and it really, REALLY exceeded my expectations. I did do a few things slightly different, due to what I had and such...I am lazy, lol, so I mixed everything up in my bread machine on the dough cycle. Also, I only had pure anise oil, which is waaaay stronger than anise extract, so I used 1/4 teaspoon and that was perfect. I had an orange that was really to tart to eat, but I didn't want to waste the entire thing, so I zested it and threw that in the mix as well~YUM! Finally, I decided that I wanted a sweet glaze on top, so I baked it plain and then made a simple glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and milk and drizzled that on top before topping with the colored sprinkles. The dough for this bread was wonderfully soft and super easy to work with. It smelled amazing while baking, and once I was able to cut into it, it had  the most wonderful, light and airy texture that I just loved! This will be a new Easter staple for my family...I am sooo happy that I found this recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I was worried that adding more wet ingredients after the dough had come together would mess with the consistency but it still worked out well. As another reviewer said I used vanilla because I had no anise extract (although I'm sure the anise would've been delicious). Finally I made a cinnamon glaze (1 cup powdered sugar 1 tbsp margaine 1 tbsp milk 1 tbsp cinnamon) to go on top. Yum! The bread also reheated well the next morning with a couple seconds in the microwave.",

I made night before and put in fridge to raise overnight and worked beautifully. Put it on round pizza stone after kneeding covered with plastic wrap sprayed with a little cooking spray so dough wouldn't stick...at 7 AM it was perfect to bake just left out for 10 mins to bring to room temp and baked. This could be changed in so many ways with different extracts and/or shapes. Yummy!!",
