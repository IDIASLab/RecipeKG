The only difference I made in the recipe was I added 1 tablespoon of milk. It came out moist not dry. Instead of 45 minutes it took about an hour. I think the parchment paper is an excellent idea cause nothing burned. It was golden brown all around. Just perfect. Definitely will be making it again.",

I sifted all dry ingredients and added it gradually at the end to the wet ingredients (so mixed eggs one at a time to butter/sugar etc then added dry). Also not sure why but I found it took much longer than 45 minutes to bake - closer to a hour. But I will definitely make this pound cake again!",

Per the tips article on Butter & pound cakes on this website I dropped the room temperature eggs one by one and added the flour 1/2 cup by half cup as I mixed. this was more manageable as you cream the sugar-butter mix with the flour and eggs. I topped with pecan crumbles to decorate a bit and gave as this as Christmas care packages to my relatives. They loved it. I can see myself baking this again but subbing vanilla with rum extract as the batter is so good!",
