I did not use carrots or potatoes but did use about 4 oz of sliced mushrooms that needed to be cooked. I also used the golden mushroom soup. I have not eaten it yet but have tasted and it is very good in flavor. I will serve this over mashed potatoes.",

Found and followed this recipe of Johnny's along with making the homemade Creole seasoning. I did use at least 3 TABLESPOONS instead of a teaspoon (must be a typo) of the seasoning that was to my taste. The meat veggies and gravy all turned out spicy and flavorful without the fatty grease. I cooked it 5.5 hours on high and the potatoes were done a couple of hours before the rest of the meal. Will hold them out for a few hours on my next cook. But this is a keeper!",
