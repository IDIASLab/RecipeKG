I also ended up adding in the whole can of coconut milk as there was very little liquid in the pan, and I do like extra liquid to serve over rice. This is super easy though! The recipe could benefit from additional flavors like fish sauce, lime and cilantro to give additional depth of flavor. It should be noted to not cook coconut milk at higher heat and to also stir often to prevent curdling.",
