I omit the sunflower seeds. You can toss all together & let sit for 10 minutes before serving. Also you can make this a main dish by adding a can of chicken breast. SO yummy!!",

One of the first things I ever tried from it was a \"pasta salad\" my mother had purchased for me. I knew that it consisted of what looked like coleslaw and ramen noodles but didn't have the slightest idea as to how they made it. I've searched allrecipes repeatedly looking for anything similar but always managed to come up short. Then I found this purely by accident the other day while looking for ways to doll up some ramen. THIS IS IT! This is exactly what I'd looked for. I did slightly alter the recipe because I had chicken ramen but it still came out beautifully! I also didn't have the specific nuts listed but I did have a can of crushed mixed-nuts for Sundae toppings (cashews peanuts pecans) which worked wonderfully. This is an excellent recipe and if you like slaw you'll LOVE this! Thank you!",
