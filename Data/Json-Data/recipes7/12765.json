The second time I kept the flour the same but added an extra egg Bingo! So add TWO EGGS I halved the baking soda and salt this time too as there was too much soda and the muffins sank. This time the leavening was perfect. I used the zest of a lemon and added the juice to a measuring cup and dispersed enough milk to make 3/4's of a cup. I fit all the batter into 12 large muffin cups instead of 15. The result is a glorious lemon poppy seed muffin!",

This recipe is moist light but not flaky. It's healthy and so delicious. The only changes I made were: 1) putting in 1/2 the sugar. (I always do that when I'm baking. They are still sweet and delicious.) 2) One of the two times I made these I put in some flax seed meal to make them healthier and I used almond meal instead of 1/4 of the flour.",
