The ingredients are simple and inexpensive, and because of the short amount of time required, some kids had time to make another batch if they made a mistake or theirs didn't turn out right.  I will definitely do it again, and I may try adding mint or strawberry flavoring.  I offered sprinkles, chocolate chips, and Oreos for toppings, and they were big hits as well.  Have fun!",
