I ended up having to use about 1/3 more of flour to get the consistency i liked..and i also doubled the vanilla(just because).If anyone is wondering like i was 3/8 cup = 1/4 cup 2 Tablespoons. The cinnamon drizzle is delicious next time i may not add the full amount of water..but just drizzle some hot water in till i find the right consistency for myself (thicker). I like how everyone can customize their own waffle with as much drizzles as they want..i don't eat cinnamon buns with the icing..so it was nice to leave that option out on my plate. The waffle itself was really good..and it may just have to replace my current waffle recipe. Thanks for sharing:)",
