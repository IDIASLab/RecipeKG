SO having said all that in order to temper my review I am going to tell you that either 375 degrees was TOO HIGH a temp for the oven OR 25 minutes was TOO LONG a baking time. As I noted I never baked biscotti before so I had to go on blind trust in the recipe. I'm so sorry to say because I would rather not review than to give a less than 5 stars but if you read this whole review either turn your oven down or start looking for burning after 15 minutes. To be fair to Chef V I will make another batch later today will adjust my baking temp to 350 will keep an eagle eye on the oven and I hope the second attempt will be successful. By the way the prep on this recipe is super easy (so I don't really mind trying again).",
