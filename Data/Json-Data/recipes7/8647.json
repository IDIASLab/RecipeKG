And I didn't follow the recipe for the glaze. I just made my own- powdered sugar and milk and a touch of vanilla. A word of caution though: USE the waxed paper as described in the directions. If you are not a pie crust maker this recipe might not be a good choice for your first pie dough experience. ALSO: no reason that this could not be made into blueberry pie bars or rhubarb pie bars or any other fruit pie bars. The comparison would be to a 10\" pie filling recipe.",

I use a little bit less sugar though because it was too sweet for me the second time when I added the correct amount. I should have reduced it then but forgot.I added half of that 1/4th cup instead of the whole 1/4th amount. And I use a lot of really good high quality cinnamon don't measure but about half a tablespoon or more.. yes I like cinnamon... Never have had a problem with the dough not fitting the pan like some of you are. Although I'm using the large glass pan the kind you make lasagna in.. I think its like 14 x 7 or around there. A tip for people having problem getting it to fit is when you roll it in the ball I square it a bit before you roll it out and then when its close lift off the top paper and share up the corners some so it rolls out more square or rectangle shaped. And make it really thin! I cant help but think maybe they aren't making it thin ugh because you want it very thin. Then I hold the pan above the dough to be sure its going to fit. I love cimmamon and I always use extra in anything that calls for it and it really does add more flavor. Also I think I added some to the dough the 1st time too. I forgot this time. and it was good Also the 1st 2 times I made this I didn't have granny smiths because we have apple trees so I used summer reds which are sweet crips and firm and a tiny bit of tart but not as much as granny smiths are so I did add in some lemon juice to i",
