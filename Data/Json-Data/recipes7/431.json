        "description": "Of all pies, pecan is one of the trickiest to make. The problem is in the crust. A fat-filled dough is tender, flaky and flavorful, but likely to tear during rolling and to develop tiny holes during baking. Naturally, the lava-like pecan-pie filling seeps into these openings, baking rock-hard onto the pie plate. A lean crust, on the other hand, is sturdy, but tough and dry. The crust I've developed offers the best of both styles: The following recipe is rich and tender, yet baker-friendly. Bonus: This silky-smooth filling tastes a little less treacly sweet, a plus for most pecan pie lovers.",

Keep your pecans pie recipes fast and simple and always add 2 T. flour or cornstarch to the filling and you will be better off.",

Firstly I think there are too many eggs the egg yolks are probably unnecessary. Secondly 1 tbsp of cornstarch will never thicken all the liquid. Thirdly the low baking temperature and blind baking the crust I have never done that previously for pecan pie 250 degrees for 30 minutes is not sufficient to set this pie. When I cooked the sugar mixture it never got thick I added instant disolving flour (Wondra) while I whisked over high heat trying to thicken it never got thick. When I baked it after 30 minutes it was still liquidy I increased the heat to 350 and baked an additional 28 minutes until just set. I had filling leftover with using a 9\" deep dish pan as well. This recipe just has too many steps dirty dishes etc to try again I will go back to Pecan Pie V. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
