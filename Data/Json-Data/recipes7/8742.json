I looked at two large grocery stores and neither one had strawberry cake mix so I used a \"rainbow\" mix instead. I pur\u00e9ed some additional strawberries and added them to the mix in place of water. That was the only change I made. I was able to fill 20 muffin cups with batter and they needed to bake 22-25 minutes before they were done. They were a lot less pink than the one in the photo and the strawberry \"filling\" was more like a mushy pit in the bottom (maybe because they were baked in a convection oven?) In spite of these things they were a big hit! I like the addition of lemon zest to the icing and plan to try it with other recipes. One tip: if you always keep a lemon in the freezer you can grate off whatever you need (for anything) and it lasts forever.",

I didn't read the reviews first and as I watched them bake I was a little worried that they wouldn't \"close up\". Some did some didn't. I waited to frost them until the next morning being certain that the icing had a chance to firm up first. The cupcakes that didn't fully close up had divits in the top but filling the hole with frosting disguised the divit very well! After frosting I stored them in the fridge until about 15 minutes before serving. The result was a very moist cupcake with most of the puree soaked into the cake. This left a hollow spot that was somewhat amusing. I think I will make these again but might try an all fruit strawberry jam instead of the puree to see if it holds together a little better.",

Instead of 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice in the icing i used the juice from 1/2 of the lemon and in my opinion it was just the right amount. Next time I plan on mixing the puree into the batter and hopefully they wont be as mushy.",
