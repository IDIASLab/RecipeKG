This turned out wonderfully and my husband was well pleased. He said it was exactly like his dad's were except he wanted it soupier, so the next time I will add some tomato juice instead of sauce or maybe in addition to. I didn't have bacon grease, I just doubled the butter. Thanks for sharing this, it brought my hubby some warm fuzzies as he has some great memories of his dad. Plain and simple, this is good comfort food! ",

This turned out okay and it wasn't anything impressive. I'm not a big fan of noodle dishes to begin with anyhow. I did finally get ahold of my mother-in-law and her recipe was so much more simple and so few ingredients I thought surely it was just going to taste worse than this one. I was so so wrong. All it required was butter to your liking (we use about half a stick or so) per one big box of dry macaroni, a diced onion, and one can of diced tomatoes. You melt the butter, soften the onions, throw the macaroni in as well as the can of diced tomatoes and one can of water. The BIG BIG difference I think in her recipe is that she tosses her macaroni in dry and then stirs it all well, throws the lid on and turns the heat completely off after bringing it up to a boil and lets the pasta sit and absorb all the tomato juices and butter.",

This is one of those all time favorites that I grew up with, and now my kids make it for their families.\n\nMy version is only slightly different. I use the bacon grease & butter to sweat half a diced onion before adding everything together, and I always use petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. (as a kid I hated all the little bits of celery & stuff in the stewed ones). If using diced instead of stewed...use a pinch more sugar.\n\nThanks again for sharing this!",
