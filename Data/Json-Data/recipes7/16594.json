When you bake a cheesecake in the oven, you also need to put a pot of hot water underneath the springform pan to ensure the top of the cheesecake does not crack. In an Instant Pot&reg;, all you need is a little water and the trivet. The result is a decadent cheesecake with no fuss. Serve with fruit on top, such as ripe blackberries.",

I left the cream cheese, eggs, and sour cream out on the counter for a good while before I made the batter, as I have read that it's important everything be room temperature to get a consistent cake texture with no cracks.  I used a pretty large lemon, so there was a lot of zest, and I'm glad because the hint of lemon flavor is so so good.  I used a 6\"x 3\" aluminum cake pan, not a springform pan, and it turned out just fine (simply run a thin knife around the edge to release it).  I also let the cake cool to room temperature before putting in the fridge.  Since I love cherries, I got a can of cherry pie filling and serve a small bit warmed on the side with it.  I will definitely make this again.",

When I opened up the InstantPot to see the finished product, it was puffed up like a souffle and residual cheesecake batter was in the bottom of the pot. Before I threw it away, I decided to leave it out on the counter for a while to see what might happen. And after about 15-20\", the  puff went down and it looked like a cheesecake again. Not sure exactly why this happened except the directions have you beat the mix a LOT so there's so much air in the batter that I'm not surprised it puffed so much. And after the puff receeded, it really was one of the best cheesecakes I have tasted. And my dinner guests agreed. I will definitely make this again but will probably back off on the kitechaide time...",

I also added a paper towel with the foil to help with the steam/water from pooling on the top. With my IP I used the Meat button and selected Normal for 35 minutes and 18 minutes for natural release. After taking the cheesecake out of the IP it is important that the cheesecake is able to set out on a rack for 1 hr in order for it to complete its \"cooking\". I also added a sour cream/sugar topping to the cheesecake while it was cooling. After the 1 hr I placed in the refrigerator for 24 hrs. It came out great!",

I made sure to fold in the eggs and sour cream rather than mix them with my food processor as I did with earlier ingredients. This kept the cheesecake from puffing up and resembling more like a souffle than a cheesecake. I also followed a tip I read elsewhere and covered the cheesecake with a papertowel and then the tin foil lightly pressed along the side- not tightly wrapped- to keep water off the top of the cheesecake. The result was incredible!! So yummy- not too sweet and the crust is the best I've had by far! So easy to do with my new instapot...I will definitely be making this again....my family said \"it's a keeper\"!",

                "reviewBody": "This was decent. I made this one, first. Then I tried another recipe from an online InstantPot community. I prefer the other over this one. While both came out very good- I just prefer the taste of the latter recipe I found elsewhere. \n\nThe crust on this one is better as far as volume. The amount is on par. But, I prefer the \u20182nd\u2019 recipe as far as taste- that one included nutmeg, almond extract & crushed walnuts to the crust. The flavor was phenomenal on that one! So while I found the volume of this crust to work very well, it totally lacked in flavor when comparing. \n\nFor the actual cake- pretty much the same except for one ingredient. And this is what I think either makes or breaks it in some way... sour cream? No. I enjoyed the \u20182nd\u2019 recipe quite a bit more as far as taste & texture using 1 cup of heavy cream. Not sour cream. Because it needs to be room temperature, too, like the eggs & cream cheese. Sour cream has 0 flavor & turns to a more \u201cwatery\u201d consistency. Heavy cream at room temperature will easily bind with whatever it is added to & has the RICH, creamy taste. So I think that is why there are complaints about the form of the cake, too. Try using 1 cup of heavy cream at room temperature instead of the sour cream. \n\nCooking time is spot on. The \u20182nd\u2019 recipe I tried had only a 30 minute cook time. It was still \u2018runny\u2019 in the center when I checked it. So at least 40 minutes with a natural release is perfect! But, I agree with the \u20182nd\u2019 recipe of letting it sit at room",

Now there were no surprises..... I followed the recipe to the letter. It DOES come out all \" puffed up \" kinda like a souffle \" - but it deflates when it cools off. The final result was creamy buttery AND delicious. More dense than airy - like a classic NY bakery made cake. The lemon the lemon zest - was a special touch. I might have used wax or parchment paper on the bottom of the spring pan mine was textured ( little bumps ) and wouldn't lift off / release. No biggie the cake was for us here at home. I'll make it again when the right occasion comes along",
