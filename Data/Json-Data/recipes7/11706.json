I was not sure what heat setting to use and then the wording made it sound like you don't stir the mixture while it boils for possibly as long as 20 minutes... I \"cheated\" and stirred it just a few times because I was really skeptical about not stirring a boiling candy mixture at all (but tried to follow the directions since I figured maybe the recipe was written that way for a reason). The result was burned sugar coating the bottom of my pan that was as hard as a rock and was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to remove. It took at least a half hour of constant scrubbing and scraping. Probably longer. The candy is edible but has a burned sugar taste. It's not terrible I guess but also does not taste like my grandma's date roll candy. Afterward I looked around more and have seen other recipes that say to stir constantly. I'm not sure if I misunderstood these directions but please clarify them or reconsider the whole \"without stirring once the boiling begins\" part. I will use a different recipe next time and be sure to stir!",
