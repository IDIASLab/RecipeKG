The description describes these as being thin and crunchy but they are waaayy thin. They spread out massively while baking so I could only do 6 on a cookie sheet at a time--and if they were baked more than 12 minutes they tasted burnt. I was hopeful that they'd taste ok even after spreading out so bad but the spices and molasses flavor gets lost in all the sugar taste. I don't think I'll make these again. Sorry.",
