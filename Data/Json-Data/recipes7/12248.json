If I were to make this again I'd add some additional liquid (water/soy sauce/vinegar) thinning out the peanut sauce a bit. I used rice vinegar reduced-sodium soy sauce and added sliced red bell pepper for a pop of color and some sweetness. This was just OK and I'm not sure that I'll even try tweaking it to get the consistency I'm looking for. Sorry Nancy Melsheimer Rudolph as the first reviewer I wish I'd been able to give this a better review. Please don't let this discourage others from trying as we all have different opinions.",
