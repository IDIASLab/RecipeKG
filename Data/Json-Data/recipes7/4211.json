I read through some of the reviews on what worked for others and rolled with it. I used Splenda sugar substitute. I did see that this didn't thicken as others had mentioned but I divided it into Ball jars and let it sit in the fridge overnight and when I checked on it this morning, it was fine. And better than the bottled kind even. I did think it was a bit sweet so I might cut back on the Splenda for next time and maybe use a fat free condensed milk to make it a little richer but I'm pretty impressed with the recipe as is. Thanks for sharing and saving me almost three bucks!",

So I open up google and type in \"chocolate syrup recipe\". And this came up. :P  I scaled it down to fit 4 servings, as opposed to the original 16. I read the reviews, and saw how people had trouble with thickening it. I knew that boiling equal parts sugar and water creates a simple syrup, so I boiled the water and sugar until the sugar was completely dissolved. THEN, I added in the cocoa powder (Hershey's brand). Once that was completely dissolved, it began to thicken very nicely. Then proceed to put in that dash of salt, mix, then add the vanilla.  Mine was a little bit too thick, but was perfect since it mixed well with the cold milk. Tiny, itty bitty chunks of the chocolate mix settled at the bottom.  This recipe is absolutely superb.",

I wanted to be able to make a smaller portion and not have that jar going to waste. (I scaled it down.) What I did like about it was that it seemed to have more of the dark chocolate taste instead of being so sweet. However I don't know what effect that had on the recipe I was trying to make. (I used the rest up on ice cream.) And it never thickened. Cook time 5 minutes? I stood there and stood there and stood there stirring and stirring. It never really did a thing. I didn't want to end up with burnt chocolate flavor so I just gave up and took it off the stove. Tossed it in the fridge to use the next day and that's when it thickened up. Would've saved a lot of time (and my feet and arm) had I not tried getting it to thicken on the stove like it was supposed to.",
