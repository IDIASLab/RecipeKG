I was a little confused on the addition of the curry powder though. The ingredients called for 4 tsps of curry divided but it didn't tell where to put the divisions in the recipe. I decided to put 2 tsp in with the rice and 2 tsps in with the butter mixture. Think I must have done it right because it was delish!! Oh it only took 45 minutes to cook instead of an hour. Thank you for a GREAT recipe!",

I altered my recipe to be more Thai-like in taste to mimic the restaurant's and turned out perfect. First of all, I browned the chicken in garlic and vegetable oil and curry powders (lots of curry powder as many reviewed the chicken to be bland)- browning all sides. I also used chicken thighs because I love the skin of the chicken. I also used chicken stock instead of water. Added cashews along with a dried raisin/cranberries combo, twice the amount of curry powder indicated and more onions (probably a 1/3 more than indicated) to pack more of a punch. I would also suggest trying pineapple- not even dried one, just the one from the can is terrific. Next time I will try a seafood version of this with scallops, mussels and shrimp. Was delish and tasted SO similar to the restaurant's. A big hit at out home! Thanks so much :)",
