        "description": "When I was a kid, my grandma made this dessert at every holiday and it always seemed like there was never enough it! It has 4 layers of awesomeness, including mousse, custard, and ganache. Feel free to take a short cut with a boxed mix and don't be intimidated by all the steps. If you know your way around a kitchen you'll put this together with ease. Quite possibly the best dessert you'll ever have. I recently made this for friends and they told me it's very similar to a beloved discontinued dessert from a popular Italian restaurant chain.",
