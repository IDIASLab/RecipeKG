As other reviewers have noted the baking time was very off. I cooked at 375 for 25 minutes then lowered the temperature to 350 and baked an additional 20 minutes. A minor change I made to the recipe was using half veggie oil and half applesauce instead of canola oil. I also used low-fat cream cheese. Neither change compromised the recipe whatsoever.
