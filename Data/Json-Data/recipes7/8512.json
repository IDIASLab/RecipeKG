I put the chocolate whipped cream on the side and topped with regular whipped cream only because I thought it was prettier with the fruit I was serving. If you find that your dessert is too loose just place it in the freezer and tell your guests it s a frozen mousse pie. They ll never know and it'll be fabulous.",
