I did have to add a little more oil than what was asked for because using half wheat flour made it drier than I think it would have been had I used all AP flour. I made this into muffins instead of one big loaf. I did not get 16 muffins, I got eleven and they were on the smaller side. Before baking, I sprinkled each muffin mound with a little cinnamon sugar. Very nice, basic zucchini bread recipe. It reminds me a lot of the one my Mom made when I was a child.",

Out of habit I beat the first four ingredients together very well before mixing in the zucchini and then mixed in the entire amount of the dry ingredients. Also out of habit I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper for ease in removing the bread from the pan. If you are looking for a little variation in zucchini breads this is a nice recipe to try.",
