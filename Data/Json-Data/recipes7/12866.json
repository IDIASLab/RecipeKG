The personal recipes version states to \"Mix the two until powder forms\" but didn't state what to mix it in. As for the kitchen approved recipe I would give it one star for the simple reason the whisk won't work.  I did a test run  in a mini food processor which still resulted in grainy confectioners sugar. Lastly I used my single serve blender and the result was a 5 star perfect powdery confectioners sugar or powdered sugar as it's also known. *Update* The kitchen approved version has been updated to reflect the proper way to make the sugar and I highly suggest using a blender.",
