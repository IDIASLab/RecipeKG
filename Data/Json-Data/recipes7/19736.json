The only modification I made to it was using three tablespoons of coconut oil to mix with nine tablespoons of butter when making the crust. I did this because nine tablespoons of butter was all I had handy when I actually needed twelve (equivalent to three-quarter cup). Coconut oil always makes a great substitute when one is either short on butter or wants to go vegan.",

I have eaten 2 fairly big bars, for quality control of course, and it is taking all my willpower to not finish the row! The only things I did different is grate some zest because I had under a 1/4 cup lemon juice. I also do not have an 11 x 7 pan (which I am immediately remedying  so I can make these perfect) so I used a 9 x 13. I cut 5 mins off the first bake because the crust was thinner, and I baked the 2nd part for 18 mins.  My oven isn't that great, so the shortbread got a little browner on one end. To save my family from having to eat the \"burnt part\", I took care of it! Moms always have to sacrifice!  ?? Seriously, make these! #momlife #lemonbarstodiefor",
