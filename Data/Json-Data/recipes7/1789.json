I follow the same directions except I now add 2-3 cups of seasoned bread stuffing, 2 stalks of chopped celery, 1/2 lb of Italian sausage, and 2 granny smith apples, skin on and chopped. And of course with dried cranberries and chopped pecans or sliced almonds toasted. Enjoy!",

I used turkey bacon vs. regular bacon. And I made the cornbread as per instructions on the box and I let it sit out uncovered over night. I also added a whole box of Mrs. Cuberdson's cornbread stuffing bread cubes. Obviously I had to add extra liquid so I added some of the turkey neck broth. Didn't have the poppy seeds either. This is definitely gonna stay a family favorite Thanksgiving recipe! Thanks.",
