Well...I spent the weekend creating my own. Darn good, quick, and EASY! Goes great on crackers with cream cheese. Sweet with a warm bite! MMMM! I picked a bowl blackberries, put them through my juicer, then froze juice until I was ready. If you want burning hot, add one more pepper. ENJOY!",

I have fresh picked blackberries that I will be attempting another batch within the next day or two with my own modifications.  I will say this the combination of the blackberries and jalapenos is fantastic.  I used the failed, but flavorful batch, to poach our awesome local salmon in the oven.  My husband LOVED it.    I will reply back with what modifications I used to get this recipe to really ROCK.\n\nI'm back!  Ok just follow this recipe fro Sure-Jell. \n\nhttp://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/surejell-blackberry-jelly-52038.aspx\n \nAdd the jalapenos with the pectin and butter and continue with the Sure-Jell directions.  It came out EXCELLENT!  I'm off to the store for some cream cheese and crackers...ta-ta!",

I have discovered it's all in the heat of the pepper. BLACKBERRY JALAPENO JELLY - I followed the receipe - I used 3 jalapeno's - all green with seeds and all - nice kick! It jelled up even before it finished cooling. Used blackberry juice I had juiced the week before - pretty color - can't wait to try with cream cheese. I will use this receipe again! Thanks! (Instead of processing I turn boiling hot jars upside down for 1-2 minutes then turn right side up and within 1/2 hour they all sealed.)",
