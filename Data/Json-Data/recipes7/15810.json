After mixing everything together there didn't seem to be enough cheese ratio so I ended up doubling that too. With that being said, these turned out pretty good. I definitely recommend scaling the bell pepper way back and adding more cheese.",

I then added a 1/2  of a large chopped onion and  jalapeno peppers from my garden to kick it up a bit. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. I used only 2 large peppers. The first time I did it, I  used rice paper rolls and it didn't work at all because they didn't stay rolled up, floating in the oil.  So, the next time I made it with egg rolls wrappers in a pan with oil and that worked great. I also added a lot more of the cheese because it just needed more. It was a huge hit with the family. Even my teenage boys liked it. We made 15 rolls that were good size. So we each had 2 or 3 and I served it with rice and an asian salad.",
