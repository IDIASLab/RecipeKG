Also needed is some pea pods along with the veggies.  How I make mine is to start with onion, garlic, a little ginger, water chestnuts stir fry together.  Add some mushrooms, and green pepper.  Remove all items as you fry them in a wok and store them in the wok cover.  Stir fry some carrots, and a little celery.  removing as they are fried and keep in cover to allow flavors to visit.  Stir some mushrooms of your choice and put them in the wok cover then stir fry the chicken, remove to a bowl, add the scalops remove to same bowl, then stir fry shirmp.  Add scalops and chicken to wok and continue to heat.  Add a mixture of corn starch and chicken broth and bring to boil and let thicken.   when thickened, add the items in the wok cover back to make one big happy family.  Served over sticky rice.  All these flavors are sure happy to be together and they will make one happy family sitting at that dinner table.    ",
