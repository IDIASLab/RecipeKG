Instead he said they were the BEST green beans I had ever made. Plus I like them a lot better like this too. Very good very easy to follow and with ingredients you probably already have on hand. Great recipe. I used ham instead of bacon because it's what I had on hand. Can't wait to try it with bacon. Thanks!",

I give it a 3 because the general consensus was that the bacon was yummy but the sauce was too sweet... and I had added less sugar than what was called for. Next time I will add more vinegar even less sugar and maybe some soy sauce based on another review I saw. I also had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken so had to add some cornstarch... next time I will drain three of the cans.",
