Keep your heat on medium and then it will thicken in 1 minute as he states, otherwise, if you put it on low it will take more like 5 minutes to thicken so quickly. You also need to make sure you chill your filling for 3-4 hours before you put it between your cake layers. The custard came out wonderfully after I made sure it thickened in the pan before I put it in the fridge for 3- 4 hours.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this according to the directions/recipe on a related link with a video, and it ended up tasting great.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the filling and the ganache did not firm up as much as they should have.  I may not have had the filling at a rapid enough boil, so even after chilling it for several hours it was pretty runny.  I firmed it up a bit by adding some plain gelatin (dissolved in a small amount of hot water).  I also used 7 tbsp of sugar in the filling, since a note on the original recipe said it could be between 6 and 8 tbsp.  The original recipe I used called for \"cream\" in the ganache.  Not knowing what that meant specifically, I used a mixture of half & half and heavy whipping cream.  The recipe listed here notes it should be heavy whipping cream, so maybe using only that would make it a little firmer.  Ultimately I had to freeze the cake to get it to stay together, especially since I had to transport it by car, and even though it tasted great it looked a little sloppy. I will make this again someday and try these adjustments, hopefully with better results.",

Then add 1/4 teas salt and 1 teas vanilla. Mix. Add four cups powered sugar one cup at a time and mix well after each cup. Add heavy cream (not whipping cream) until the mixture is very  firm but spreadable. (Weather conditions determine how much cream is needed.) When ready to frost top of cake place ganache into the microwave for a few min. Careful not to burn, but must be porable. ( Add small amount of milk it needed) Pour on the middle of cake and use knife to spread it out causing some to run down sides of the cake. Ganache will firm up after it cools. \nAlso after you take cakes out of oven press down on middle of each cake to make it flat with the edges taken hump out of middle of cakes. This will not hurt the taste and will make a more professional looking finished product.",
