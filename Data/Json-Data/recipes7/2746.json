For anyone not sure how to cook the squash, I cut it in half lengthwise, scraped out the seeds and pulp, and then placed face down on a cookie sheet and baked at 400 for 40 minutes.  I let it cool for a little bit and then I scraped out the flesh with a fork.  I had a rather large squash and got about 5 cups out of it, so you should only need 1.  If you do not cook the squash long enough, the pie may have unwanted liquid.  I will definitely make this again.  ",

I blend the sugar (I use less than a cup), eggs, butter, lemon juice and vanilla in a blender and pour over the squash and stir together and pour into a greased 9X9 dish and bake as recommended until a knife comes out clean. I have never used a pie crust with this recipe and we have never missed it. \nThe squash seems to be a more acceptable texture to most if it is chopped up into small strands before mixing in.",

It did take a bit longer to cook and when I finally pulled it out after 50 minutes (and my oven runs HOT) it still didn't allow a knife to come out clean but it was still great. I think I'd recommend cutting the squash up a bit. When it's long and stringy it's tough to cut each piece. The whipping cream is wonderful on it -- don't skip it!!",

Use the square ones spray the pan first and use a small glass to press the wonton wrapper into the well of the pan. Fill with the mixture and bake only 30 min.
