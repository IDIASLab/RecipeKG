This version isn't as rich as the original recipe which is great for someone like me who isn't a total fan of the bars (it's still rich as far as cheesecakes go though). I chose to make this in a 9\" springform pan for the classic good looks of a cheesecake thus I halved the filling but kept to the orginal scale for the crust and topping. I may not have crushed my cookies as much as the recipe intended as there was just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. There was just enough ganache to top the cheesecake as well. Turned out very impressive looking on the serving table and was definitely enjoyed by all.",

I did this plus added some vanilla bean and 1 tsp vanilla extract b/c I read that custard powder is vanilla flavored. It turned out delicious! Makes an impressive dessert and great because you can cut up beforehand. Also I topped half the pan with toasted almond slivers which turned out to be preferred. I agree with another reviewer though- next time I think I will use milk chocolate for the top as I think the semi-sweet was a bit much. Thanks for sharing!",
