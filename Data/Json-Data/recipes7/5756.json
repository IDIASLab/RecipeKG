I made this as written using a 10 inch bundt pan because I did not have a tube pan.  \n\nUPDATE: I have upgraded this from 3 stars to 4.  When I tried it, I was not that big of a fan, but I served it to my in-laws and also some people at work and they all said it was great!  So, this must depend on your personal tastes :)",
