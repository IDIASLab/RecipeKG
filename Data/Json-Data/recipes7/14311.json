I went ahead and made this exactly as written but halved the recipe and baked at 300 for 20 minutes using Dark Chocolate chips. \nI would make sure to beat your egg whites properly and be very gentle when folding the chocolate mix into the whites. Do not over mix and it's fine if you see ribbons of the white still. I would give these a 5 but the appearance is lacking a bit.. \nThe taste however is really phenomenal. The dark chocolate I used gave it a nice rich but not too sweet flavor. It's practically a guilt free dessert for chocolate lovers. \nI will make this again when I'm in need of a nice chocolate fix, perhaps will add 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar next time to stabilize the whites. This may help in the appearance department. \nWould be nice served as mini cakes on a plate with some ice cream or a nice Berry compote. \nThank you for sharing.\nUPDATE: after having these in the fridge..they take on a whole new world of yumminess. .. dense and brownie like!",
