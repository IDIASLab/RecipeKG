The recipe worked out perfect. It took 70 minutes before starting to crystallize, but it happened very quickly, so keep a close eye at the 1 hour mark. I ended up with a lot of extra ginger sugar, but fortunately I love ginger, so I\u2019ll be saving that for later.",

Im not sure if my method or measurements are correct, but it turned out GREAT!!  I did 2 cups of diced up small pieces of ginger (packed down with my hand), about 4 cups of sugar, & 2 tablespoons of water.  Brought to a simmer at med./high heat.. then dropped it down to just under medium.  At first I thought I had it wrong, there was ALOT of melted sugar in the pan, but after 1 hour, it started to crystalize! It goes FAST! (which is why I had no pic of it).   Turned off stove and removed the skillet  from the burner but kept the mixture in the pan for a min. or 2 while I broke up chunks of sugar with spatula.. by the time I moved it to a pan to dry, it was already pretty much dried up.  I got 2 CUPS of delicious ginger bits.. and 3 CUPS of ginger flavoured sugar, YUM!  Packed up some sugar for my ginger loving friends and using the rest of it to use in my next batch of Peanut Butter Cookies!  I had some in my coffee this morning also, delicious!!  Who knew this could be so easy!  I will def. be making this again in the future!",

Morena sugar is GMO free and is pure sugar with a golden color as it is not bleached. I followed the recipe precisely other than the type of sugar used. The sugar crystallized in half an hour not an hour. The candied ginger became very hard...not pliable and juicy like store bought which is what I'm looking for. This candied ginger can bust your teeth...so it's not usable for baking in cookies but can be substituted for a hard candy. It's not the result I was hoping for although I surely will use every bit of it. I Love ginger.",
