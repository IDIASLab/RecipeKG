This was the base for truly the best fist tacos I have ever had. \n\nI used a bag of pre-cut cabbage instead of doing it myself (yes, at 1am I was a little lazy).\nI substituted 5.3 oz container of plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo. \nI doubled up on the cilantro because it's soooo good.\nTHEN I added about 1/3 cup of chopped jicama to give this a nice crisp refreshing subtle crunch.\n\nI let the slaw sit in a bowl in the fridge covered with clear plastic wrap for about 10-12 hours and then topped it off with some Hidden Valley Ranch ( on the tacos only, NOT in the slaw itself)\n\nAt first I thought the slaw was a little spicy for the average person (I love me some heat), but as it all set over night and was able to blend and the addition of ranch really gave this dish amazing full flavor!!\n\n*Note* I ONLY made the slaw, and used frozen breaded cod fillets instead.",

It was ruined and way too acidic because of it, even on the mango and pineapple, which could have been nice.  I also eliminated the jalapeno pepper because we don't like hot stuff.\n\nAlso, in my opinion, a fish tortilla needs tomato to taste good.  My cod came out great, but we threw away the sauce.\n\nMaybe with changes, a teaspoon of pepper, no salt, and a teaspoon or 2 or vinegar, it would have been good.  What a shame.",
