I had my concerns about these from the beginning but I resisted the urge to tinker with the recipe because in this case I thought it important to make these as is (except for using butter rather than margarine) and not put my own spin on them. First I m always a little skeptical of a basic cookie dough that calls for milk or any liquid for that matter. It generally isn t necessary. Also I was afraid I wouldn t like the spices as listed. I generally don t like any spice with oatmeal cookies but a little cinnamon is fine. This recipe by contrast had no cinnamon but rather a little nutmeg and quite a substantial amount of cloves. I doubted I would be a fan of that but I kept an open mind. My concerns however bore out on both issues. The milk wasn t necessary at all in fact it made a dough too loose and sticky and a cookie much too soft - and kind of unattractive too I might add. As for the spices the taste of cloves is overbearing even off-putting. I m afraid I can t recommend this recipe.",
