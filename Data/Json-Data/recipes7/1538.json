                "reviewBody": "Served this flan to the family after a very spicy dinner of Chile Colorado and 6 of us ate 3/4 of the whole thing and then the kids fought over the last piece - it was delicious! Swapped out the evaporated milk for coconut milk, left the sugar out of the egg mixture, added 1 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla as previous reviewers have suggested. I put 1/4 cup water with the sugar for the caramel mixture - this will help control the sugar browning process. Poured the caramel into a preheated 10\" x 1.5\" round pyrex dish with straight sides. I cooked the flan in a water bath. Be sure not to use a good dish towel for this as it bled the color out of a good towel. Next time I may try it with out the water bath method as it adds a lot of work. Also I forgot to pre-heat the water for the water bath and this extended the time of cooking to almost 90 minutes! Once cooked I let cool for 15 minutes and then ran a knife around the outside edge. Since we were going to eat dinner in about 2 hours I put the flan in the freezer for about an hour and then moved to the refrigerator. After dinner (about 3 hours after the flan came out of the oven) I put a serving plate over the top of the pyrex dish and then inverted it so the flan came out on top of the serving dish and out of the pyrex. The caramel flowed beautifully over the top and down the sides - it looked perfect. Not only was I surprised how good it all came out, my family was equally impressed and I am now considered Chef Extrordinaire!",
