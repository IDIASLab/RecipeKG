So much more flavorful than all the cream of mushroom soup recipes I had to sift through to find one that used whole ingredients. \n\nFor anyone saying that the recipe was too bland and who added cream of mushroom soup, you would get the same effect by adding a cup of salt to the recipe. Yuck. There's no creativity in using those soups, and they are NOT AT ALL healthy. Loved that this was a whole ingredient recipe without any poison added. (No, I'm not brainwashed, just like to know what I'm putting in my body.) \n\nWe put the extra gravy over garlic mashed potatoes although I probably could have just eaten it with a spoon when no one was looking. :) The only things I changed: I used real garlic added with the onions instead of powder or garlic salt, and extra mushrooms, because we're kind of obsessed with them here.",
