I tweaked it a bit: instead of white sugar I added 1 overripe banana and half a teaspoon of liquid stevia for sweetness and a teaspoon of vanilla extract while keeping everything else the same. the cake did not rise at all hahaha. I think I need to cut back on the water next time there's probably too much added liquid with my tweaking. still amazing though! I've made it twice now. Thank you for such a simple healthy recipe:)",
