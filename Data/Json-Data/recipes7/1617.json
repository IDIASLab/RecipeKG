It seemed chintzy almost. \n\nREVISIONS: \n-I doubled the mix, substituting 1-2 tablespoons of honey for some of the sugar (makes that 'fried' ice cream taste)\n-Added 1/2 t cinnamon, nutmeg\n-Added 1/2 cup crushed pecans (also key to the fried ice cream taste)\n- Added chocolate chips\n\nRESULT: The dessert was DELICIOUS and everyone loved it. I used Lactose Free Breyers vanilla because it is a bit softer but tastes exactly the same. The softness allowed me to cut these much more quickly and for the littlest kids to be able to bit into these without have them melt.\nGive it a try- you won't be disappointed!",

I increased the amount of rice cereal/brown sugar/etc. topping because that is my family's favorite part. I also added cinnamon to that mix and it was even better. Finally we have tried it with homemade caramel sauce on top honey drizzled over top and even chocolate fudge sauce. All great ways to make the dessert even more decadent.",
