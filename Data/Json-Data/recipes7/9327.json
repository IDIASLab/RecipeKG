The only reason I gave this recipe four stars instead of five is because although we followed the directions to a T the dough turned out very stiff. I would recommend adding 2-3 tablespoons of milk to soften the dough up a bit and make it easier to work with. I also used special dark cocoa and it made the flavor so rich and decadent. I will definitely be making these again!",
