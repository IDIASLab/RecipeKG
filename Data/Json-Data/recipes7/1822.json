The only things I had to change were to use some lime zest instead of lemon, frozen peas instead of canned, and omit the black olives. I also added some crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper for spice! I used twelve baby octopi and scaled this for two servings but it still made a lot, enough for a lunch tomorrow. I served it with whole wheat angel hair pasta. It was very delicious! My boyfriend was impressed with how tender the octopus was. Thanks!",

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and ended up with an overcooked, tomato soupy mess.  The peas should not be added so early in the cooking process, as they turn to mush.  The potato was completely pointless, and didn't compliment any flavors or textures. I looked up \"mixed spice\" on wikipedia, and was told it consisted of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  That combined with mint, citrus zest, and curry powder, made a confused and over spiced palette that did not compliment the octopus.   There are simply too many things going on and getting cooked for too long, for this to be anything near an acceptable food.   It wasn't horrible, but it sure wasn't worth an 1hr 30min.    Don't spend time cleaning any octopus to make this meal!",

Sugar is listed in the ingredients but is not to be found in the directions. Still a good starting point for a great dish. It has a wonderfully complex flavor and we will be making it again. We used paprika cumin smoked salt and smoked pepper flakes in the spice mix and substituted beef base sherry vinegar and a little water for the wine since we live in an alcohol-free household. We zested one whole lemon and a whole orange and didn't use curry powder. We added the sugar in the saute step. The octopus came out with a beautiful texture which always worries me because I have had some extraordinarily bad octopus. Our kitchen smelled like the briny deep while it was cooking. I was concerned about potatoes in a dish meant to be served over pasta but it turned out just fine. Fettucine tossed with olive oil was the perfect substrate then all we needed was a houseguest to torture. \"Hey look you can see the little suckers on the tentacles...\"",
