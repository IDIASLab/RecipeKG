Instead I poured a little bit of the milk and vanilla (mixed up already) into the honey and butter. I did not feel the need to let it sit in the refrigerator. It was great this way. Of course I through some of the milk and vanilla mix away because I only wanted to use a little bit which kept it from being so watery. Such a lovely taste. Thank you so much.",
