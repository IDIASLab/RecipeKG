If I can't use this recipe for the pineapple, can you suggest a recipe for that?  You rock!!!  Thank you!!!  Love this!!!",

I first made this recipe last year, and I used this recipe, as written. I found the candied Buddha\u2019s hand to be very bitter\u2014so much so that I threw it all away. I\u2019m not sure if I did something wrong or my fruit was over ripe?  I haven\u2019t had more fruit to try again until now, so here I am a year later with a new crop. I did some research and decided to add a teaspoon of salt to the blanching water, 1/4(ish) teaspoon of salt to the sugar/water mix, and I picked the fruit while there is still a tinge of green left (prior had been solidly yellow on the tree for a few weeks). The bitterness level has improved a million times and the candied Buddha\u2019s hand turned out beautifully. This is a terrific recipe and the video is quite helpful.",
