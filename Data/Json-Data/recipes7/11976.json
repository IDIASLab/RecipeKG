My family liked these even better than my usual wheat flour waffles.  Now that we are eating gluten free this will be my new basic waffle recipe. Looking forward to experimenting with different gluten free flours.  Thanks stairguy for this awesome recipe!",

I am also sensitive to eggs and dairy so I used almond milk and egg replacer. I used applesauce instead of the oil like the author said you could. I don't make waffles any more because I am on a low fat diet so I used an ungreased electric skillet and made pancakes. All I can say is that these were amazing! They taste so close to regular pancakes that I thought I was in heaven while eating them. Thank you for this recipe. :)",

                "reviewBody": "Very versatile and infinitely forgiving recipe. The description is right on the waffles do get a great crispy outer shell even if you change up the ingredients they are definitely for people who like buckwheat and the half creamer and half milk does make notable changes in the outcome. I made two and a half batches of these. Batch 1: I used cream and milk along with \"dark\" buckwheat flour. This version came out almost cake-like and somewhat dense still good though. I couldn't get them out of the waffle iron and thought it may be my machine so I made pancakes out of the rest of the batter and they came out nicely. Batch 1.5: I used \"dark\" flour half kefir and half milk and they were rich and dense and had a noticeable nutty flavour and crunch-a bit heavy though. Batch 2: I made with \"light\" flour and milk. These came out light and tender not fluffy or cake-like. Batch two was more what I consider a \"regular\" waffle: crispy outside and airy inside. The taste of buckwheat was evident in the batch 2 but not as powerful as with the dark flour. All versions are very good. In the end this recipe allows you to play around and experiment; but the original recipe-the way it is given-turns out a delicious waffle and stands up to its claims. Thanks stairguy for the treat!",
