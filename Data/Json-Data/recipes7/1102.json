A few modifications I made: for the topping, I use 1/2 c  oatmeal AND 1/2 c chopped walnuts & pecans.. it makes it extra crunchy & extra nutty. Also, I use 3 c fresh pears & 3 c fresh apples. Where the recipe calls for boiling the pear syrup, I make my own syrup with 1 c water, 1/2 cup sugar, & 1/4 brown sugar. I use nutmeg in place of cloves, and added in  about 1 tbsp cinnamon. Served HOT with vanilla ice cream.. absolutely delicious :)",

The first time was for a funeral at church so I tripled the recipe and the second time was for dessert for our Bible Study group. The first time I processed the ginger snaps finely and used almonds in the topping. I didn't think the top was crispy enough so today I left some chunks in the ginger snaps and I used oatmeal instead of the almonds. I preferred that topping. Since there is a good bit of juice that accumulates in the bottom of the bowl of chopped pears I drain off as much as possible but both times I put some extra corn starch in the sauce to make sure it thickens enough. I found it baked up perfectly that way. I also added a little more ground ginger to the sauce to give it a little more kick. I thought this was delicious as did everyone else who tried it. This may be my new favorite fall recipe.",
