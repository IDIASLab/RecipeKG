Curiosity hooked me right away. It's not bad - it comes together quickly and certainly is easy enough to make. It's kind of a cross between chocolate pudding and hot cocoa. Having said that however the consistency is odd like it can't make its mind up between the two. In addition it's not sweet enough and is rather flat tasting - it could definitely benefit from a little extra sugar a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt. The concept was intriguing and Hubs and I did enjoy it but not enough to make again. I guess we'd prefer either a cup of hot chocolate or a dish of chocolate pudding.",

I added three TBLS of sugar because I like my chocolate sweeter.  It was the perfect amount as suggested by another reviewer.  I also added two dashes of Cayanne pepper, and three dashes of cinnamon to give it that little extra kick of heat and to cut the chocolaty flavor just a bit. It was really good.  I know the recipe says it makes two servings but it filled my big mug and I drank it all.  If you want that extra creaminess, use either 2% or whole milk.  Also, dipping sponge cake in it is heaven!",

This did live up to being a pudding-y hot chocolate and it hit the spot. I followed the suggestions of adding a dash of salt and a splash of vanilla but in the future I may try adding some cinnamon or cayenne as one reviewer mentioned. I did increase the sugar to three tablespoons and I thought the level of sweetness was just right without being overly sweet. I put one mug in the fridge and let the other cool slightly on the counter. If you want a more liquid-like drink then don't refrigerate as the texture becomes more pudding-y.",
