I followed the recipe but subbed a sweet red Reisling for the port wine as it was what I had. I accidentally forgot the orange zest and it was still fine. I wasn't sure how I would like the ginger so I just did about 1/2 tsp of ginger paste from a tube. I also didn't bother with the toasting of the walnuts. It is very rare that un-shelled nuts don't come already slightly roasted today. I look forward to seeing how well the leftovers hold up. Interesting recipe on basic cranberry sauce.",
