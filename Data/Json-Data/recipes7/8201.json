I did use whole almonds in place of the cashews b/c they are more affordable for me to buy (they worked out great!) but followed the recipe otherwise. I did end up adding more cinnamon sugar to get a better coating on them so they wouldn't be sticky. These really came together quickly and would be wonderful to give as gifts. I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.;)",

Parchment paper is oven safe up to 420 F. I only use foil when I am unable to use parchment paper.",

Wasn't sure I had enough cashews so I added 2 cups of whole almonds and 2 cups of pecans (because they are my personal favorite) Turns out that made it the perfect amount - for a Double Batch!! Hurried and put necessary ingredients with original to double mixture. Other than accidentally doubling batch I added 1 TBS of sea salt before cooking. LOVED the results! Can't wait to see how they go over at party yet part of me wants to keep some home!!;-)",
