After reading the review about it being too chunky I simply took half of it out of the pot and used my immersion blender then added it back in. This smoothed it out quite a bit. I also added a clove of garlic because we love garlic in everything. We are veg so I subbed cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken and veggie broth for bouillon. It was delicious. We'll be making a lot of this over the winter. I think you could use any type of potato, not just red.",

Added diced carrots and potatoes, salt and pepper, dash of thyme and sauteed until vegetables were softened. Added milk and stock to cover and simmered until vegetables were tender. Added 3 cups frozen, riced cauliflower and continued simmering until thawed and tender. Added cream, cream cheese, bacon bits (reserved some for serving), additional liquid as needed and simmered until smooth. Added cheese off heat, stirred until melted. Stirred in parsley, adjusted seasonings, served topped with additional cheeses and bacon.Everyone loved it! SO wanted shredded chicken added next time!",

I was pretty faithful to the recipe my only edits were sauteed onions in 2 tbsp butter and I used white potatoes since thats what I had on hand.And I forgot the cheddar cheese (didn't miss it) Also I can tell you the store bought real bacon crumbles work great and lend the perfect flavor. Since I was short on time I simmered on the stove top. Rich and delicious a keeper declared my husband. Our kids and I are having this right now for lunch! Kid approved!",
