I entered it in the county fair and took first place plus the gold ribbon which entitled me to enter the State Fair. So I entered the State Fair and came in second. I was told that if I had told the judges it was an original recipe, I would have taken first place. This was the very first time I had ever entered anything like this before, for both fairs and I guess you could say I was wet behind the ears. Oh well, I sure did have fun.",
