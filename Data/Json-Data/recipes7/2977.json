I was a bit worried, as I've never tried that before, but these ended up as lighter, lemony cupcakes, which is what I was going for.  I just frosted with a storebought frosting I wanted to use up, and it worked well.  This does make a lot of cupcakes, so bear that in mind.  Thanks for the recipe!",
