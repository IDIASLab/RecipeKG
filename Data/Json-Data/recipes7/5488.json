The second time I made it I substituted orange juice and orange extract in place of the lemon. Also very good but I would probably add a hit more extract to the batter. For the icing - to keep it completely dairy free instead of the creamer mixed with water I used 50-50 water/OJ (or lemon juice for the original recipe) and then cut the extract in half. I needed to add a bit more liquid than the recipe calls for to get the icing to the consistency I wanted. But overall I would definitely eat this again. And very simple to make.",
