        "description": "These coated chocolate cookies are frightfully delicious! They have been a long-time favorite in our house during the Halloween season. I found this years ago published in the local newspaper. I still have the clipping, but cannot give credit to its creator/author, as none was printed in the article. Great family-time baking project; the kids love to help form the chilled dough into the mummy shapes, with clean hands, of course! Great for Halloween, but we also use this dough for Xmas candy cane and wreath-shaped cookies, too. Have fun!",

I left them in until they started to crack a bit on the top and looked like they had set. I used the Ghiradelli candy white chocolate for the coating and it worked better than the white chocolate with the shortening - I tried both and the candy was smoother and easier to use. Both tasted amazing! I just preferred the ease of the candy! Delicious!!! My husband said they tasted like brownies with chocolate on top!",

My husband confirmed on the Hershey\u2019s site that it matches so mystery solved! I made the cookie batter exactly as it called for. My first batch on the cookie sheet I made too large so I started to make them smaller and worked out great. They do puff up a little but retains their shape for the most part. The only thing I did differently was the white chocolate. I put some in a ziplock bag, microwaved until soft and snipped off a corner to drizzle it on. This created more of a bandaged look. I didn\u2019t add shortening because I didn\u2019t want it to runny and then the drizzle melt into one big layer. The cookies taste like cakey brownies (which I don\u2019t usually care for, I want fudgy) but these pack so much flavor they are delicious!",
