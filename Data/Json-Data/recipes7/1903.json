I made/baked it exactly as directed (no water bath no leaving in the oven nothing) except I always use less sugar even though I am crazy about sugar and everything it goes into but all recipes usually call for way too much of it. 1/8 cup sugar to the crust 3/4 or less to the cream cheese mix 1/3 or less to the sour cream mix. But it will taste all right if made with all sugar too:o) If you are going to put sweet fruit topping on top you may want to use less sugar in the cake. I also never have a cream of tartar bummer I just put 1 tsp lemon juice. Do not over beat eggs! No cracks ever! But it wouldn't matter because you're going to cover it with sour cream. I baked it longer the first time because it was wobbly in the middle then I baked longer than 5 minutes with sour cream mix on top but you don't have to do it 50 and 5 minutes is enough. Anyway even over-baked it tasted great. I don't think you can ruin this excellent recipe. You don't have to be a perfect baker to make this cake takes minutes to mix everything up so easy thank you so much! P.S. I made it dozens of times comes out perfect every time.",
