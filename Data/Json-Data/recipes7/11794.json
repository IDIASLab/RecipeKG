If you look below at the reviews, you\u2019ll see the recipe submitter says 2 previously frozen bananas, but she gives her personal recipe link which says 1 banana (peeled and previously frozen).  So what do you use?  I went with 2 frozen bananas, thawed, which worked out well.   I cut back a bit on the sugar (personal taste) and opted not to make the icing.  I also didn't want a cold coffee cake, so I didn't refrigerate and served warm.  In spite of a confusing recipe, the coffee cake cooked up beautifully, moist and tender with both banana and apple flavors present.  I don\u2019t think they make 15.25 ounce cans of pie fillings anymore, so I bought a 21 oz can and used all of it.  Also, my cake mix was 15.25 oz, so I just added some cake flour to get up to the 18.25 oz mark.  Honestly, with the way this started off, I was prepared for a failure, but in the end, had an easy and delicious coffee cake which I would make again",
