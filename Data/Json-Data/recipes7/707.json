I have also used a similar recipe to make what I call chicken schnitzel. That said this recipe is very good. I did add a spice blend of salt pepper garlic powder and onion powder to the breading.

It's even better if you tenderize the pork cutlets the day before and let them soak overnight in a mix of milk and egg in the fridge (just enough to cover the cutlets). They are much more moist and flavorful. We also like to top our schnitzel with both a strip of swiss and a strip of cheddar or american cheese then stick them in a warmed oven for a few minutes to let the cheese melt. We picked this up from a friend who was born and raised German (entire family is still there). It's wonderful.",
