Don't cut or trim the bread before frying for two reasons: the bread fries very fast so turning over triangles result in several burnt pieces (stainless steel set on low). Second it is much easier to trim after frying. 4. Very hard to estimate how much milk to use since it all depends on bread's thickness and density so play by ear/taste. 5. I used almond milk to satisfy some in our group and it was fine 6. Needs to cool until thickened so overnight should work 7. Probably would not make again - lots of work and cleanup and my Kheer and Kulfi (available in AR) are very easy and make-able the day ahead",
