Surprisingly according to Hubs that turned out not to be the case. He said this was a nice medley of flavors no one flavor dominating. Why the 4-stars then I asked him. Well he said it was good and not heavy on any one flavor but still a strong fruity flavor didn't pop out at you. (Hmmm he gave it 4-stars but that sounds like an average 3-star smoothie to me...)",

But I had used an over-ripe banana and had left out the sugar and thought it only fair to make it again. So I used a less ripe banana and did add the sugar which unlike many people I did think was necessary. (And I'm no sugar fanatic by any means. I think it had more to do with flavor than sweetening.) I'm sure it depends on the selected berries somewhat and how good the fruit is. I used blueberries strawberries blackberries and raspberries. (Less strawberries the second time because I also like the strawberry flavor more subtle.) I don't like the seeds of black/raspberries so I've started straining them. This can be quite thick and the only good way to strain them is put them and all the milk only in the blender strain and then add everything else.",
