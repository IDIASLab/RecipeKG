Using the tomato and basil sauce as a base is a great idea because you're already starting off with something that's bold and loaded with flavor.   I find many gazpachos watery, but the tomato and basil sauce in this recipe gives it good consistency right at the start.  The fresh veggies give it some crunch and layers of flavor.",

I microwaved the veggies just to kill off any enzymes. The texture was good even w/ microwaving. It made me think a chunky v8.
