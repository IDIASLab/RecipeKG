        "description": "This is a new spin on a traditional Jewish food. They're very sweet and fun to make, making it a great recipe for kids who want to help out in the kitchen. They also make great finger food for parties. Be sure to remove any jewelry before getting started though - you'll be putting your hands into a very sticky mess, and it can get everywhere! Serve hot with apricot preserves, applesauce, maple syrup, or parmesan cheese. If you have a food processor, that will probably work as well, though I prefer the extra-fine result that comes from using a cheese grater. They can also be frozen and reheated.",

I actually made these twice.. once I wasnt paying attention and threw all the ingredients in together and baked.. the second time I made per recipe - squeezing the shredded veggies out. I really couldnt tell the difference so I would say no need to squeeze them out unless you have really juicy veggies. Mine were fine. I added salt and pepper and they were perfect. I also cooked a few in the waffle iron.. they cooked well too. Only thing to add it some oil to the batter to get them crispy",
