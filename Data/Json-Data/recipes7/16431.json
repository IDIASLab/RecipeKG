It's tangy, sweet, crunchy, and salty all at the same time. Serve at room temperature as a side dish to grilled fish or as a starter on toasted bread. Store leftovers in fridge and reheat gently.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't boil the celery ahead of time (wasn't sure what the point was since I was going to saute it again anyway???). Also I couldn't find fresh basil that looked good so I used 1/2 tsp. dried and while I was at it added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano and a few springs of fresh rosemary that I had to use up. The result was a savory sweet delicious vegetable dish that I ate as a main course. I will definitely make this again hopefully with fresh basil so I can try it exactly as written.",
